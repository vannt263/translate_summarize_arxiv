    "faddeev model@xcite was originally proposed as a model which might give rise to 3-dimensional soliton solutions .",
    "later it was discussed that the model might be an effective field theory describing the low energy behavior of the @xmath0 gauge field@xcite .",
    "it can be regarded as a restricted version of the skyrme model@xcite which may be an effective field theory for hadron dynamics . because of the high nonlinearity of faddeev and skyrme models , the analytic structures of solutions of these models have not yet been clarified .",
    "the numerical solutions of these models , however , exhibit quite interesting soliton properties@xcite-@xcite : soliton solutions of the skyrme model have tetrahedral structures while those of the faddeev model have knot structures@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the faddeev model is a model concerning the real scalar fields @xmath1 satisfying @xmath2 it is defined by the lagrangian density @xmath3\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\epsilon_{abc}n^a(x)\\partial_{\\mu}n^b(x)\\partial_{\\nu}n^c(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants . the static energy functional @xmath6 $ ] associated with @xmath7 is given by @xmath8&=\\int dv \\epsilon(\\boldsymbol{x}),\\\\   \\epsilon(\\boldsymbol{x})&=c_2 \\epsilon_2(\\boldsymbol{x})+c_4   \\epsilon_4(\\boldsymbol{x}),\\\\ \\epsilon_2(\\boldsymbol{x})&=\\sum\\limits_{a=1}^{3}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{3}[\\partial_i   n^a(\\boldsymbol{x})]^2,\\\\ \\epsilon_4(\\boldsymbol{x})&=\\sum\\limits_{i , j=1}^{3}[h_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{x})]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 and @xmath10 . by the stereo - graphic projection ,",
    "the field @xmath11 can be expressed by a complex function @xmath12 as @xmath13 in terms of @xmath12 , the energy densities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 @xmath17 the field equation can be rather simply expressed by @xmath18 defined by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 of the dimension of length has been set equal to @xmath23 and @xmath18 is dimensionless .",
    "the static field equation can be written as@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are a complex and a real @xmath27-vectors given by @xmath28 respectively .    in this paper , we discuss some simple analytic solutions of the above equation .",
    "we shall consider mainly the vortex solutions of the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the cylindrical coordinates and an integer , respectively .",
    "we adopt an approximate analytic solution containing two adjustable parameters .",
    "its form is fixed by the compatibility with the boundary condition and the singularity - structure necessitated by the field equation .",
    "the parameters are fixed so that the energy per unit length of vortex , @xmath32 , becomes minimal .",
    "we find that the minimum of @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath31 approximately .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2 , we discuss the @xmath33 case briefly . in sec.3 , the above - mentioned approximate analytic solution for the @xmath34 case",
    "is discussed .",
    "sec.4 is devoted to summary .",
    "we first consider the solutions of the form @xmath35 where @xmath30 are cylindrical coordinates",
    ". then we have @xmath36,\\\\ y&=2x^3,\\\\ \\phi^{'}&=\\frac{d\\phi(\\phi)}{d\\phi},\\quad   r_{\\rho}=\\frac{\\partial r(\\rho , z)}{\\partial\\rho } , \\quad r_{z}=\\frac{\\partial r(\\rho , z)}{\\partial z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are orthonormal unit vectors satisfying @xmath39 , etc .",
    "+ we obtain @xmath40 from im\\{@xmath41}=@xmath42 .",
    "then , taking the single - valuedness of @xmath12 into account , we are led to @xmath43 on the other hand , from re\\{@xmath44}=@xmath42 and @xmath45=@xmath31 , we have @xmath46=0,\\\\ g&=1+\\frac{2m^2r^2x^2}{\\rho^2}.\\label{eqn:2.12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the @xmath33 case , it becomes @xmath47=0 $ ] , whose solution is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 are constants and @xmath50 denotes the @xmath51-th legendre polynomial .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath52 is a solution , too .",
    "these results indicate how cho s solution@xcite @xmath53 should be generalized .",
    "they are , however , trivial in the sense that the interference effects between the @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the lagrangian disappear in these solutions .",
    "+ for @xmath34 , we see that the simpler cases such as @xmath56 are not allowed since @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2.12 ] ) contains @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are polar- and toroidal- coordinates , respectively . only the vortex solution @xmath61 , which is a solution of the @xmath62-dimensional faddeev model , is allowed",
    "we hereafter consider the case @xmath61 and @xmath34 .",
    "if we set @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 through a further change of variables @xmath65 we obtain an algebraic differential equation @xmath66 the solution of this equation can be explored in the following way . for a given @xmath67 which is different from @xmath42 and @xmath23 , we assume that the solution @xmath68 near @xmath69 is given as @xmath70 then we are led to @xmath71 and @xmath72 and so on .",
    "it turns out that @xmath73 and @xmath67 are arbitrary and @xmath74 are fixed by them .",
    "+ although @xmath75 can be determined order by order , it is difficult to conclude that the series ( 3.5 ) converges in some domain of @xmath76 around @xmath67 . to obtain the radius of convergence of the series ( 3.5 ) , if any , we must calculate @xmath75 for very large @xmath51 , whose mathematical expression becomes quite complicated as @xmath51 gets large .",
    "the differential equation ( 3.4 ) suggests that the behavior of @xmath68 at @xmath77 and @xmath23 ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) may be different from that at ordinary points @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is also difficult to maintain the properties of @xmath68 near @xmath82 and @xmath23 by an infinite series of the form ( 3.5 ) .",
    "we therefore consider an approximate @xmath68 which realizes the properties required by the lowest order analysis of ( 3.4 ) around @xmath83 , @xmath77 and @xmath84 .",
    "+ as was explained above , the behavior of @xmath68 in the neighborhood of @xmath67 is given by @xmath85 .",
    "we next consider the behavior of @xmath68 near @xmath77 .",
    "it turns out that the behavior @xmath86const.@xmath87 is compatible with ( 3.4 ) only when @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "we here recall that , with the assumption ( 2.10 ) , only @xmath90 and @xmath91 yield the vanishing energy density irrespective of the value of @xmath92 .",
    "these values of @xmath93 imply @xmath94 , leading to @xmath95 . in other words , if we require that the energy density is vanishing at @xmath78 , the differential equation ( 3.4 ) and the assumption ( 2.10 ) lead us to @xmath96 similarly , from the requirement that the energy density is vanishing at @xmath97 , we obtain @xmath98 it is straightforward to see that the conditions @xmath99 correspond to the configurations @xmath100 or @xmath101 at @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore we are here considering the configurations interpolating these configurations . in the example considered below ( fig.4 ) , we obtain @xmath68 connecting @xmath100 at @xmath78 and @xmath101 at @xmath97 .",
    "we note that , in the analysis of the hedgehog skyrmion , the solution of the differential equation @xmath102\\frac{dw}{d\\eta}-\\frac{w[(\\eta+1)w-2\\eta]}{2\\eta^2(\\eta-1)^2(w-\\eta)}=0   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] was investigated@xcite by a trial function @xmath103 which yielded a rather good value of the energy .",
    "+ in the following , we consider the approximate solutions @xmath104 given by @xmath105^{2m}}{(\\zeta - p_m)^2 } , \\quad m > 0 , \\quad q_m>0,~\\quad 1>p_m>0,\\ ] ] which is compatible with the singularity - structure indicated by the differential equation and the boundary condition that the energy density vanishes at @xmath106 .",
    "+ the energy @xmath107 corresponding to the assumption ( 2.10 ) , which we denote by @xmath108 , is now given by @xmath109^{2m-1}}{(\\zeta - p_m)^2+q_m\\left[\\zeta(1-\\zeta)\\right]^{2 m } } \\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{q_m\\left[\\zeta(1-\\zeta)\\right]^{2m-1 } \\left[\\zeta(1-\\zeta)+m(2\\zeta-1)(\\zeta - p_m)\\right]^2 } { \\left\\{(\\zeta - p_m)^2+q_m\\left[\\zeta(1-\\zeta)\\right]^{2m}\\right \\}^2 } \\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac{1}{8}\\frac{q_m^2 \\zeta^{4m-2}(1-\\zeta)^{4 m } \\left[\\zeta(1-\\zeta)+m(2\\zeta-1)(\\zeta - p_m)\\right]^2 } { \\left\\{(\\zeta - p_m)^2+q_m\\left[\\zeta(1-\\zeta)\\right]^{2m}\\right \\}^3}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we fix @xmath110 and @xmath111 so that they minimize @xmath32 . for @xmath112 , they are given as + @xmath113 + it seems that @xmath110 approaches to @xmath114 when @xmath31 becomes large .",
    "for the convenience of numerical estimation , we fix @xmath110 as @xmath114 for @xmath31 larger than @xmath115 and determine @xmath111 so as to minimize @xmath32 .",
    "the result is given as follows : + @xmath116 + the results for @xmath32 and @xmath117 are given in fig.1 and fig.2 , respectively .",
    "we are then led to the approximate formulae @xmath118 and @xmath119    since the infinite product @xmath120 converges to @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 for large @xmath31 . from the fact that @xmath123 and @xmath124",
    ", it looks like that there exists an atom - like object q with energy @xmath125 and unit @xmath31 and that the assembly of @xmath31 q s constitutes the configuration with @xmath31 .    with the original variables , the energy density @xmath126 defined by @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath129",
