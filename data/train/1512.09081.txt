    "the key point is that we derive these novel wpdrs directly from the uncertainty relation for the min- and max - entropies , which we henceforth abbreviate as mmeur .",

    "the min- and max - entropies for a classical - quantum state @xmath15 are defined by @xcite @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the probability of guessing @xmath18 correctly given the outcome of the optimal povm ( positive operator valued measure ) measurement @xmath19 on system @xmath20 , and @xmath21 quantifies the secrecy of @xmath18 from @xmath20 , as measured by the fidelity @xmath22 of @xmath23 to an uncorrelated state , where the maximization in is over all density operators on @xmath20 . here , the fidelity is @xmath24 .",

    "this concludes our abstract results , and we now move on to discuss wpd .",
    "henceforth we consider an @xmath0-path interferometer .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows a source injecting a photon into a fiber optic , which then approaches a fiber coupler @xmath40 , creating a superposition of which - path states inside the interferometer .",

    "each path receives a phase shift @xmath42 , with @xmath43 denoting the set of all phases .",
    "finally , the paths are recombined with a fiber coupler @xmath44 , and the photon is detected at a detector .",
    "we argue that the mmeur provides a robust , operational framework for discussing wpd , particularly due to the above connection with the guessing probability .",
    "indeed one can think of wpd operationally as a statement that one can not build an interferometer that allows one to win two complementary guessing games .",
    "namely , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we consider a `` particle game '' and a `` wave game '' .",
    "the particle game asks the experimenter to guess which path the photon takes inside the interferometer , and the experimenter is given access to subsystem @xmath12 to help win the particle game .",

    "hence , for arbitrary @xmath0 , we propose the following formula @xmath88 note the similarity between and .",
    "we emphasize that captures the intuitive notion of interference visibility , since @xmath89 quantifies the spatial contrast of intensity at the interferometer output .    with these definitions we state the following result .",

    "we extend the wpdr in ref .",

    "also , @xmath97 denotes the probability for detector @xmath65 to click when the system s density matrix has been diagonalized ( i.e. , decohered ) in the which - path basis .",

    "interestingly , the formula for @xmath98 somewhat resembles the standard definition for visibility in and , in fact , reduces to for @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we show that also provides a natural framework for a scenario called quantum erasure ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an experimental implementation ) , which aims to enhance the visibility by erasing the which - path information stored in the environment .",

    "the first wpdr for @xmath0-path interferometers was given by drr @xcite .",
    "drr exploited the fact that the purity function @xmath115 can be broken down into two terms : @xmath116 where @xmath117 . since @xmath118 , eq .",
    "gives a wpdr where the first and second terms on the left - hand side are interpreted as measures of particle and wave behavior , respectively .",
    "( more precisely , drr incorporated some dimension - dependent scaling factors into these terms for normalization purposes . )    furthermore , drr generalized the relation in to the more interesting case where a which - path detector obtains some information inside the interferometer , i.e. , the scenario considered in .",
    "however , drr s generalized relation has been critiqued @xcite due to the fact that it is not saturated for all pure states . nevertheless , we do not see this as a major issue .",
    "consider that maassen and uffink s eur @xcite is not saturated by all pure states . yet",
    "their relation is by far the most famous eur , and it has inspired countless studies on the topic .",
    "we believe that much more important issues are whether the employed quantitative measures are ( 1 ) operational / experimentally friendly and ( 2 ) capture one s intuition about wave and particle behavior .",
    "one could argue that drr was on the right track , in this sense , with his measure of wave behavior , for which he gave an operational interpretation @xcite .",
    "however , drr s measure of particle behavior is not as operational or intuitive as the one in  , proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "interestingly , some recent studies @xcite seem to do the opposite of drr .",
    "they employ operational measures of particle behavior , e.g. , ref  @xcite employs the definition in .",
    "but these references replace visibility with a more abstract quantity called coherence .",
    "while coherence is an interesting quantity for theorists , it remains to be clarified how it precisely relates to interferometry experiments .",
    "the nice aspect of our approach is that both the wave and particle terms are operational - both involving the optimal guessing probability .",
    "the symmetric nature of the two terms seems quite natural .",
    "it leads to a simple guessing - game view of wave - particle duality , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "furthermore , all of the previous works stop short of considering the case where both the input and output beam splitters are asymmetric .",
    "indeed the relations derived in @xcite do not apply to this situation .",
    "the fact that we can treat this situation is a testament to the robustness of our entropic - uncertainty framework .",

    "in some cases renes s bound is tighter than , and in other cases the opposite is true .",
    "interestingly , like us , renes derived his relation directly from the mmeur .",
    "in summary , we obtained three novel wpdrs for @xmath0-path interferometers , eqs .  , , and , each of which generalize the famous wpdr of refs .",
    "all of these novel wpdrs follow directly from the mmeur , combined with our new operational meaning for the max - entropy in . in this sense ,",
    "wave - particle duality is the entropic uncertainty principle in disguise , and the latter provides a robust framework for formulating the former .",

    "first let us introduce our notation . recall that @xmath99 denotes the photon s spatial degree of freedom inside the interferometer and @xmath8 is the environment .",
    "let @xmath168 denote the bipartite state for @xmath99 and @xmath8 at a time immediately after these two systems finish interacting inside the interferometer , and denote this time as @xmath169 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , after time @xmath169 , the photon receives a phase shift @xmath9 depending on its path , which we can write as the unitary @xmath170 then the photon approaches @xmath11 , whose action is given by some unitary matrix @xmath171 applied to @xmath49 .",
    "finally the photon is detected at one of the detectors .",
    "let @xmath172 denote the povm associated with detection at the interferometer output .",
    "this povm gives rise to the random variable @xmath173 , which encodes the information about which detector clicks , as noted in the main text .",
    "for notational simplicity , we lump together @xmath171 and @xmath174 into a single step , and we define the povm @xmath175    as noted in the main text , we will need to modify the definitions of distinguishability and visibility in order to formulate a universally valid relation .",
    "let us first consider distinguishability . consider a game",
    "where one tries to guess which path the photon took given that one knows that the photon was detected at a particular detector , say detector @xmath65 ( which corresponds to @xmath64 ) .",
    "the guessing probability for this game can be written as @xmath176 , i.e. , the probability for guessing the path @xmath47 given the optimal measurement on the environment @xmath8 , and given the outcome @xmath64 .",
    "we define the _ post - selected _",
    "distinguishability @xmath96 as @xmath177    moving on to visibility , we define @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the probability for detector @xmath65 to click maximized over all phases @xmath45 applied inside the interferometer . also , @xmath97 denotes the probability for detector @xmath65 to click in the case where the state inside the interferometer is fully decohered , i.e. , where all of the which - path information has leaked out to the environment and hence the system s density matrix has been diagonalized in the which - path basis .",
    "mathematically , we can write @xmath180    the intuition behind the formula for @xmath98 is the following .",
    "it quantifies the degree to which adjusting the phases @xmath45 can increase the probability @xmath63 to detect the photon at detector @xmath65 , beyond the baseline value @xmath97 associated with no coherence .",
    "so it quantifies the effect of the applied phases on the final detection probability .",
    "one may notice that @xmath98 looks somewhat similar to , which is the most common way of writing @xmath1 in the two - path case .",
    "indeed one has @xmath181 in the two - path case , which can be seen using the following identity @xcite @xmath182 which holds in the special case of @xmath69 .",
    "however , for @xmath183 , @xmath98 is generally not equal to the expression in .",
    "we remark that @xmath96 and @xmath98 can be experimentally measured as follows .",
    "the experimenter , whom we call alice , can insert a variable attenuator into each arm of the interferometer in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , such that the attenuator can be set to either allow the photon to pass or to block the photon .",
    "to measure @xmath96 , alice flips a fair @xmath0-sided classical coin in order to determine which path inside the interferometer to keep open ( to allow the photon to pass ) , while blocking the other @xmath7 paths . to compute @xmath176 alice employs a second experimenter , named bob , who tries to guess which path alice kept open , given that bob has access to @xmath8 and given that he post - selects on @xmath64 outcomes . in the case of @xmath98 , measuring @xmath184 is straightforward , while @xmath97 can be measured as follows .",
    "alice once again flips a fair @xmath0-sided classical coin to determine which path inside the interferometer to keep open ( while blocking the other @xmath7 paths ) , and then computes @xmath97 as the number of detection events at @xmath65 divided by the total number of detection events .",
    "@xcite proved a wpdr for the two - path mzi for the general case where both fiber couplers ( or beam splitters in the case of free - space propagation ) are asymmetric .",
    "we now state the following theorem , which generalizes the wpdr in ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath0-path mzi .",
    "[ thm1122 ] for the @xmath0-path mzi in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where @xmath6 and @xmath11 are arbitrary ( possibly asymmetric ) fiber couplers , it holds that @xmath185 moreover , is a special case of the mmeur in .",
    "the proof simply involves applying to the appropriate density operator .",
    "consider an isometry @xmath186 that produces a copy of the which - path information and stores it in a register @xmath187 , which we can write as a map @xmath188 given by @xmath189 consider the density operator obtained from applying this isometry to @xmath168 , @xmath190 we note that @xmath191 is not actually the physical state ; rather it is a mathematical construction that we use to prove the desired result .",
    "now consider the density operator obtained from post - selecting on events where detector @xmath65 clicks ( i.e. , where @xmath64 ) .",
    "that is , we take the density operator @xmath191 and we consider its overlap with the povm element @xmath192 associated with the event @xmath64 .",
    "applying this post - selection to @xmath191 gives the following density operator , @xmath193   } { { { \\rm tr}}[({\\openone}_{s ' } { \\otimes}\\tilde{{\\mathbb{c}}}_1 { \\otimes}{\\openone}_{e}){\\tilde{\\rho}}_{s'se } ] } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now apply to the density operator in , setting @xmath13 to a trivial system and @xmath194 , giving @xmath195 where the @xmath196 subscripts in serve as a reminder that the entropy terms are evaluated for the state in , and the @xmath187 subscripts in indicates that the random variables arise from observables on system @xmath187 .",
    "noting that @xmath197 is a copy of the which - path information for system @xmath99 , one can see that @xmath198 where we note that refers to the physical state @xmath168 .",
    "likewise we can relate the max - entropy term in to @xmath98 as follows @xmath199 where we elaborate on the proof of below . inserting and into and rearranging gives the desired result .",

    "also , uses the fact that any state @xmath207 that is unbiased to the @xmath53 basis can be written as @xmath208 for some set of phases @xmath14 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",

    "averaging over all @xmath101 gives the quantities @xmath210 where @xmath105 is the probability of outcome @xmath101 .",
    "then we have the following result , which is a generalization of theorem  [ thm111 ] .",
    "( we remark that , while the following theorem is stated for the case where @xmath11 is symmetric , this assumption can be relaxed using the approach in appendix  [ app3 ] , where the definitions of visibility and distinguishability are slightly modified . )        1 .",
    "the system @xmath99 ( i.e. , the photon s spatial degree of freedom ) interacts with an environment @xmath212 , via cptp map @xmath213 .",
    "system @xmath212 is measured and the outcome is stored in a register @xmath214 , via cptp map @xmath215 .",
    "the experimenter uses this measurement result to enhance the visibility on system @xmath99 ( i.e. , to sort the data point into a sub - ensemble and determine the optimal phase shift for that sub - ensemble ) .",
    "this is modelled as a cptp map @xmath216 that couples @xmath214 to @xmath99 .",
    "the overall cptp map @xmath217 is a composition of these three maps : @xmath218 suppose the system starts in the state @xmath219 , just after it enters the interferometer .",
    "the interaction with @xmath212 results in the state @xmath220 .",
    "next , @xmath215 performs the measurement @xmath221 on system @xmath212 and stores the outcome in two ( redundant ) registers @xmath214 and @xmath222 , resulting in the state @xmath223 here , state @xmath224 corresponds to obtaining outcome @xmath225 from measuring @xmath106 , with the set @xmath226 forming an orthonormal basis on the register hilbert space , and outcome @xmath225 leaves system @xmath99 in the conditional state @xmath227,\\quad\\text{with}\\quad p_{{y } } = { { \\rm tr}}\\big [ ( { \\openone}_s { \\otimes}{\\mathbb{y}}_{{y } } )   \\rho_{s { e}}^{(2 ) } \\big ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the point of having two registers ( @xmath214 and @xmath222 ) is that one register will act as system @xmath12 - to be used to enhance the distinguishability - while the other will act as system @xmath13 - to be used to enhance the visibility .    for each outcome @xmath225",
