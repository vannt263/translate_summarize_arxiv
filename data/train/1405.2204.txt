    "modern cosmology ( see monographs [ 1 - 5 ] , review [ 6 ] , and historical overview [ 7 ] ) studies the most fundamental problems of the origin of our universe by combining the physics of elementary particles and quantum field theory , especially as regards studying the very early epochs .",
    "the inflationary paradigm as part of quantum cosmology should be specially mentioned here .",
    "this paradigm offers elegant solutions to several cosmological problems simultaneously , but the specific model of inflation remains to be chosen .",
    "the study of the nature of dark matter and dark energy that are present in the universe is another important field of modern cosmology .",
    "the importance of these substances of an unknown nature is dictated by their dominance , 95% of the mass in the modern universe : dark energy and dark matter ( also called `` hidden mass '' ) respectively provide about 68.3% and 26.8% of the total mass , while ordinary baryonic matter ( stars , interstellar and intergalactic gas ) contributes only about 4.9% .",
    "the nature of fields that form dark energy and dark matter particles remains unknown . as in the case of the inflationary paradigm ,",
    "many theoretical models have been offered for dark energy and dark matter , but it is unclear which of them will be viable in the future and whether there is a true model among them that is realized in `` our universe '' .    the energy - dominating substance at present , dark energy ,",
    "was discovered by analysing the accelerating expansion of the universe inferred from remote type - ia supernova observations [ 8 - 10 ] .",
    "later , its existence was confirmed by independent measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations and other effects .",
    "some scalar fields that remain from early epochs or the energy of quantum fluctuations of the vacuum could provide an explanation of dark energy . in this review ,",
    "we focus on the cosmological epochs in which dark energy effects were negligible .    the problem of dark matter , which is the main topic of this review , has good chances to be solved in the nearest future .",
    "dark matter particles , incident on earth from space , can be registered by the existing and future detectors , or can be produced in collider experiments ( at the large hadron collider , first of all ) .",
    "there is little doubt that dark matter does exist in the universe .",
    "dark matter explains the shape of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , the dynamics of stars in elliptical galaxies , high gas temperatures in the halos of galaxies and galaxy clusters , and the motion of galaxies in small groups and in clusters .",
    "the presence of dark matter reconciles the results of primordial nucleosynthesis calculations with the observed elemental abundances by taking cmb anisotropy measurements into account . only with dark matter",
    "is it possible to explain the stability of galactic discs and their spiral structure .",
    "the distribution of dark matter can be `` mapped '' using strong and weak gravitational lensing observations : the appearance of multiple images of galaxies and their shape distortions [ 11 ] , including in colliding galaxy clusters ( the bullet cluster , etc . ) .",
    "although the nature of dark matter is unknown , the inflationary paradigm offers a natural model for generating density perturbations from which dark matter halos formed at later stages ; ordinary baryonic matter cooled and streamed toward the centers of these halos .",
    "this process led to the formation of galaxies , stars , planets , and ultimately life .",
    "reviews of possible particle candidates for dark matter and methods for searching fort hem can be found , e.g. , in [ 1,12 ] . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )",
    "are most frequently considered to be the likely dark matter candidates .",
    "they could have formed in the early universe in a number suitable to explain the observed dark matter . among these particles ,",
    "the neutralino  the lightest supersymmetric particle?is very popular [ 13,14 ] .",
    "other candidates include sterile neutrinos [ 15,16 ] , axions [ 17 ] , gravitinos [ 18,19 ] , superheavy particles [ 20 - 23 ] , and primordial black holes ( pbhs ) [ 24 , 25 ] .",
    "the discovery of the light higgs boson with the mass @xmath0  gev [ 26 - 28 ] has strengthened the status of the neutralino as the dark matter particle . the existence of a light higgs boson , heavy grand unification particles , and supergravity are contradictory in principle because radiation diagrams ( loops ) predict the mass of the light boson @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the coupling constant and @xmath3  gev is the grand unification scale .",
    "supersymmetry elegantly solves this problem by providing compensation to radiation diagrams , and no simpler and more elegant solution is known in the theory .",
    "if the light higgs boson with a mass @xmath4  gev had not been discovered , the existence of supersymmetry would have been in doubt .",
    "the discovery of the light higgs boson with the mass @xmath4  gev involves supersymmetry as the simplest and most natural explanation for its small mass .",
    "supersymmetry is assumed to be broken using so - called soft terms in the lagrangian , which are described by at least five free parameters .",
    "the fixed mass of the higgs boson imposes constraints on these parameters and those of the grand unification , as well as on the masses of supersymmetric scalar particles ( sparticles ) .",
    "the supersymmetric particles and the lightest particle among them , the neutralino , have not been discovered so far in the atlas ( a tororidal lhc apparatus ) and cms ( compact muon solenoid ) experiments at lhc , possibly not because these particles are too heavy but due to the weakness of their interaction .",
    "future measurements with increasing fluxes of these particles will likely uncover supersymmetric particles ( see the discussion of higgs particles and supersymmetry after the discovery of the higgs boson in [ 29 ] ) .    the direct registration [ 30,31 ] or production of dark matter particles in accelerator experiments can provide the most reliable information on their nature ; however , indirect methods of searching for them ( for example , using their annihilation products and other effects ) should also be appreciated , for two reasons .",
    "first , there is no guarantee as yet that dark matter particles will be directly detected in the foreseeable future .",
    "second , if dark matter particles are directly detected successfully , many `` applied '' problems will arise regarding the role of these particles in astrophysics , the influence of these particles and their annihilation and decay products on the composition of cosmic rays , the state of interstellar matter in the past and now , and other astrophysical processes .",
    "this means that many questions that are currently being considered in connection with the indirect detection of dark matter particles will be treated at a new level ( with the already known dark matter particles ) .    from the standpoint of indirect detection , searches for signals ( first of all , photons ) from dark matter particle annihilation seem to be the most promising .",
    "if dark matter particles can annihilate , the efficiency of this process is mainly determined by the dark matter density .",
    "the local annihilation rate is proportional to the square of the particle number density , and therefore the signal from dense clumps can be higher than from the diffusive dark matter component .",
    "for example , dark halos of galaxies , which were formed from primordial density perturbations several billion years ago , can have a higher density than the average matter density in the universe . at the time of writing this review",
    ", the most distant galaxy was discovered by the hubble space telescope at the redshift @xmath5 ( without spectroscopic confirmation ) , which means that the galaxy was formed when the age of the universe was 380  mln years ( after the big bang , or since the end of the inflation stage ) , when the reionization of the universe had not yet completed .",
    "but even at earlier times , protogalaxies should have been formed : the ` building blocks ' of galaxies , which are similar to present - day dwarf galaxies .",
    "the character of dark matter clustering , the mass and formation time of these ` blocks ' , and the efficiency of their merging and mass increase due to the accretion of external matter depend primarily on the density perturbation spectrum . according to the most reliable model , perturbations were generated at the inflation stage from quantum fluctuations .",
    "recently , the fluctuation spectrum was measured with high accuracy by the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) [ 32 ] mission and the planck space observatory [ 33 ] .",
    "however , the telescopes from these space missions can measure the perturbation spectrum only on very large scales . according to the inflationary paradigm",
    ", the spectrum of primordial perturbations extends to much smaller scales , which are bounded from below by the cosmological horizon scale at the end of inflation ( the mass of dark matter on this scale is about @xmath6  g ) .",
    "this means that already before the formation of protogalaxies , clumps of dark matter with masses much smaller than the solar mass could have been formed .",
    "these clumps are the first structures that emerged in the universe .",
    "small - scale clumps of dark matter and their role in astrophysics are considered in detail in this review .",
    "for brevity in what follows , we refer to these small - scale clumps of dark matter simply as clumps .",
    "we can visualize a clump as a sufficiently loose `` cloud '' of moving dark matter particles that are bound by gravitation forces but do not fall onto a common center because of their angular momenta .",
    "the clump has an almost spherical shape and is in a quasistationary state if tidal forces from other objects or density perturbations are absent .",
    "the slow evolution of the internal structure of clumps can be due to weak gravitational perturbations , the binary scattering of particles , or annihilations of particles .",
    "the slow accretion of dark matter particles onto clumps from the surrounding diffuse component tends mainly to increase the effective radius of the clumps .",
    "rapid and strong restructuring of clumps can be due to gravitational impacts of interacting clumps or collisions with stars . in certain cases ,",
    "a clump can capture another clump or , just the opposite , can be captured by a larger clump .",
    "the boundary between the slow accretion of dark matter particles and the process of gravitational capture of small clumps ( coalescence of clumps with strongly different masses ) is somewhat conventional , but can be described by the generalized press ",
    "schechter formalism [ 34 ] .",
    "we briefly discuss the terminology . in the english  language literature , dark matter clumps",
    "are usually referred to as `` clumps '' , `` dm objects '' ( dark - matter objects ) , `` halos '' , `` minihalos '' , or `` microhalos '' . the last three terms stress that in many respects , clumps are diminished analogs of large dark matter halos in galaxies .",
    "indeed , by neglecting gas - dynamic processes with baryons occurring in galaxies , the equations of gravitational dynamics and principal formation processes of small - scale clumps and galactic halos are basically the same and differ only by the characteristic scales and the form of the perturbation spectrum at these scales . at small scales , the spectrum flattens , leading to rapid aggregation of clumps : the formation of large - scale clumps , with the characteristic time of this clustering being of the order of the formation time of the internal density profile in the clumps .",
    "by contrast , during the hierarchical clustering on galactic scales , the objects with density profiles already formed coalesce more frequently .    the formation and evolution of small - scale clumps have been studied in many papers [ 35 - 51 ] ( see [ 52 ] for a short review of some aspects of the clump problem as of 2009 ) . in some papers ( see , e.g. , [ 53 ] ) , a phenomenological approach has been used , which postulates the presence of clumps in some fraction of dark matter with a certain density profile and other free parameters , but unrelated to the specific density perturbation spectrum .",
    "the mass spectrum of clumps is bounded by some minimum mass @xmath7 depending on the properties of dark matter particles and their interactions with cosmic plasma in the early universe at the radiation - dominated stage [ 54 ] .",
    "the formation of clumps with minimal masses occurs not due to the coalescence of smaller - scale objects but from individual density fluctuations without significant internal inhomogeneities ( substructures ) .",
    "hence , clumps with minimal masses , as well as those emerging from the perturbation spectrum with a high peak , can be segregated into a separate class of clumps to which the analytic model in [ 55 - 57 ] can be applied .",
    "the mass @xmath7 is model dependent ; the value of @xmath7 for the neutralino in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 [ 41,42,46,58,59 ] .",
    "the minimal clump mass ( the mass spectrum cutoff ) @xmath7 is determined by collisional and collisionless decay processes ( see , e.g. , [ 41 ] and the references therein ) .",
    "additionally , the mass spectrum cutoff can be affected by acoustic waves [ 60 ] during the kinetic decoupling of dark matter particles [ 61 ] , as well as by perturbation modes with the horizon scale [ 62 ] .",
    "calculations [ 46 ] showed that to flatten small - scale perturbations , friction between dark matter particles and cosmic plasma , similar to the silk effect , is important .",
    "uncertainties in estimates of the minimal clump mass are due to uncertainties in the neutralino models involving free parameters . a clump wit a minimal mass @xmath10 , which is obtained for the most likely supersymmetry parameters for the primordial power - law perturbation spectrum with the exponent @xmath11 derived from the cmb data , has the following characteristic parameters .",
    "the first dark matter objects , which in this case are formed at the redshift @xmath12 ( for @xmath13-perturbations ) with the mean density @xmath14  g  @xmath15 , have the virial radius @xmath16  pc and the internal velocity dispersion @xmath17  cm  s@xmath18 .",
    "the evolution of clumps in general should be studied in the hierarchical framework , which takes coalescence and aggregation of clump into account .",
    "tidal interactions play a fundamentally important role in these processes , because tidal forces destroy most clumps at the early stages of hierarchical structure formation [ 39 ] .",
    "clumps that survive the early hierarchical stage are further destroyed by collisions with stars in galactic bulges , halos , and discs . in this review ,",
    "we show that the collective gravitational field of the disc has a much stronger effect than the total contribution of individual nearby stars .    in the foreseeable future",
    ", there is hope to directly register gamma - ray fluxes from particle annihilations in clumps .",
    "it is virtually impossible to observe small - scale clumps ( they collectively contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background ) , but sufficiently large clumps can be observed , in principle , as individual sources : they can form bright spots in the x - ray and gamma - ray sky [ 63 - 65 ] .",
    "the contribution of clumps to the annihilation signal is characterized by the enhancement coefficient , or the boost factor , which is by definition equal to the ratio of the signal with account for dark matter clumping to that from diffusively distributed dark matter .",
    "theoretical studies of dark matter halo formation [ 55 - 57,76 ] predict power - law internal density profiles @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the density profiles obtained in numerical simulations ( navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profiles and moore  et  al s profiles [ 77 ] ) have a similar divergent central density with @xmath21 . a result close to the isothermal power - law profile with @xmath22",
    "was obtained in numerical simulations of small - scale clumps [ 77 ] . in [ 51 ] , it was found that if a clump results from hierarchical clustering , then its density profile coincides with the nfw one .",
    "if a clump is formed from an isolated density perturbation ( including minimal - mass clumps ) , its density profile has a central core with @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the singular profiles that have not experienced collisions have central profiles closer to those of moore et al and gurevich  zybin [ 55 - 57 ] .",
    "the increase in the density @xmath24 in the clump center as @xmath25 is limited by the total ( integral ) clump mass and especially by the finite value of the annihilation signal : @xmath26 for density distributions with @xmath27 , the presence of the central core is physically necessary , i.e. , the core must exist in a wide class ofmodels .",
    "most frequently , the core is postulated in the form rint @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "different physical mechanisms can be responsible for the formation of the central part ( core ) of clumps during their formation and evolution .",
    "it can not be ruled out that these mechanisms are different for clumps with different masses formed under different conditions .",
    "the structure of the clump core is possibly determined by small - scale density and velocity inhomogeneities inside the forming clump ; this problem was studied for galaxies in the framework of the entropy theory [ 78,79 ] .",
    "a theoretical estimate of the clump core radius can be obtained using the energy criterion : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the density perturbation amplitude at the beginning of the matter - dominated cosmological stage [ 57 ] . in application to clumps with a minimal mass @xmath32 formed from @xmath13-peaks ( @xmath33 ) in the spectrum , this estimate yields @xmath34 .",
    "it can not be ruled out either that the core size or , at least , the characteristic scale of the density profile change @xmath35 is also determined by tidal forces [ 39 ] .",
    "there is an alternative core formation mechanism in models with `` metacold dark matter '' , in which the core appears due to the late decay of dark matter particles into light nonrelativistic particles with low phase density [ 80,81 ] .",
    "the low spatial resolution of numerical simulations currently prevents the determination of the core radius .",
    "the only example pointing to the presence of a core with a radius @xmath36 was obtained in calculations in [ 77 ] . however , in the simulations in [ 82 ] , the core was not resolved down to the relative radius @xmath37 , to which the power - law density profile with @xmath38 extends .",
    "new , dedicated high - resolution modeling is required to solve this problem .    in [ 40 ]",
    ", the conclusion was made that almost all small - scale clumps in the galaxy are destroyed by tidal interactions with stars and are transformed into `` ministreams '' of dark matter .",
    "the properties of ministreams can be important for the direct detection of dark matter particles , because dark matter particles in the streams move anisotropically in different discrete directions .",
    "however , as shown in [ 83 ] , cores of clumps ( or clump remnants ) generally survive in tidal interactions with galactic stars .",
    "although the external layers of clumps are `` stripped off '' and produce dark matter ministreams , their cores are shielded by the adiabatic invariant conservation and continue to produce the annihilation signal .",
    "most of the annihilation signal power is generated in the central parts of the clumps , and therefore the total annihilation flux is weakly affected by the tidal destruction process [ 37,43 ] .",
    "this statement is critically dependent on the unknown core radius : cores with smaller sizes are more stable , because dark matter particles there have higher orbital frequencies and , accordingly , higher values of the adiabatic parameter .",
    "the clump remnants form a low - mass `` tail '' of the standard mass function for masses below @xmath39 .",
    "in addition to the `` standard '' clump formation scenario , hypothetical models have been proposed in which super - dense clumps are formed at the radiation - dominated stage from entropy [ 84 - 87 ] and adiabatic [ 88 ] density perturbations , taking restrictions from primordial black holes into account .",
    "entropy perturbations , for example , can be produced by loops of cosmic strings .",
    "superdense clumps are interesting from the standpoint of annihilation of superheavy dark matter particles , because their small annihilation cross section can be compensated by the high density of the clumps .",
    "therefore , ultra - high energy annihilation signals become possible . in this case ,",
    "new effects can appear that determine the central density core formation in superdense clumps , such as fermi degeneration of superheavy dark matter particles in the cores of such clumps .",
    "the superdense clumps can be registered by the tidal effects they produce on gravitational wave detectors . in this review",
    ", we consider the formation of superdense clumps in much detail , because this problem has not been analysed sufficiently in the literature .",
    "the presence of matter inhomogeneities at small scales in early epochs is a necessary condition for the formation of small - scale clumps .",
    "galaxies and other structures form from density perturbations @xmath40/\\bar\\rho$ ] , which generally can be adiabatic perturbations , entropy perturbations , or a mixture of both .",
    "adiabatic perturbations are also referred to as curvature perturbations because the local curvature in such a perturbation differs from the mean curvature of the universe .",
    "entropy perturbations represent another possible type of perturbation .",
    "these include dark matter perturbations on top of a homogeneous radiation background .",
    "the effect of entropy perturbations on the space curvature is typically insignificant , and they are usually called isocurvature perturbations . according to cmb observations ,",
    "the statistical distribution of adiabatic perturbations is gaussian with high accuracy , and the contribution of entropy perturbations to the total perturbation amplitude , if present , does not exceed a few percent .",
    "we briefly discuss the perturbation statistics .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath41 is characterized by a power spectrum @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes complex conjugation , @xmath45 is the wave vector , @xmath46 is dirac s delta function , and the angular brackets mean ensemble averaging , i.e. , averaging over a large number of spatial volumes .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath47 at an arbitrary time instant @xmath48 is related to the initial power spectrum @xmath49 ( at superhorizon scales ) as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the transfer function and @xmath52 is the linear growth factor ( see , e.g. , [ 89 , 90 ] ) . for small - scale modes , we have @xmath53 for @xmath54 with the logarithmic accuracy . the rms density perturbation @xmath55 on a scale @xmath56 is expressed in terms of @xmath42 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fourier transform of the window function [ 89 ] .    the statistical properties of forming structures are considered using two basic approaches : ( 1 ) by counting the number of peaks with certain characteristics [ 89 ] ; ( 2 ) in the framework of the press ",
    "schechter formalism and its generalizations ( see [ 34 , 91 , 92 ] ) .",
    "the second approach deals with the fraction of the dark matter mass contained in objects with a given mass scale .",
    "a generalization of these two approaches , and in some sense their synthesis , the so - called `` peak - patch picture '' , was developed in [ 93 ] .      in the inflation theory ,",
    "curvature perturbations are generated from quantum fluctuations of a scalar field .",
    "the amplitude of the latter , @xmath59 , is connected with the hubble parameter @xmath60 during the inflation stage [ 2 ] , where @xmath61 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "the density perturbations at the horizon crossing time are given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the planck mass and @xmath64 is the potential of the scalar field ( inflaton ) that is responsible for the inflation .",
    "the simplest inflation models give a nearly flat perturbation power spectrum @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , some tilt of the spectrum is usually predicted , which is fundamentally important for small - scale clump formation , because even a small tilt can significantly change the perturbation amplitudes on low mass scales .",
    "the difference between @xmath67 and unity is expressed in terms of the slow - roll inflation parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the gravitational constant , as follows : @xmath71 in the @xmath72-model by starobinsky , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of e - foldings ( increases in the scale factor by @xmath75 times ) since the beginning of the generation of these perturbations until the end of inflation .",
    "the value of @xmath67 in the inflation model has not been precisely fixed yet ; as well as the common normalization constant , @xmath67 is determined from the cmb anisotropy measurements and the inhomogeneities of matter distribution in the universe .",
    "observations thus constrain possible inflation parameters [ 94 ] .    immediately after the end of inflation , the perturbations ( on the scales considered here ) have a size greatly exceeding the cosmological horizon , but as the horizon increases @xmath76 , they enter under the horizon at some instant of time .",
    "to investigate perturbations with scales larger than the horizon size , it is necessary to solve the linearized einstein equations [ 2 ] . using them , it is possible to match the solutions ( and the initial conditions ) on subhorizon scales .",
    "the perturbations that are deep inside the horizon can be studied using the newtonian equations ( taking the potential of a homogeneous relativistic background into account ) , but setting the initial conditions does require solving the linearized einstein equations",
    ". at the radiation - dominated stage , small adiabatic perturbations ( those on the linear stage ) , @xmath77 , grow slowly on subhorizon scales , @xmath78 , and after the transition to the dust - like stage , @xmath79 , they start increasing rapidly as @xmath80 .",
    "the normalization constant in perturbation spectra is frequently chosen from the requirement that the relative mass fluctuations on the scale @xmath81  mpc correspond to the value @xmath82 , which is directly obtained from galaxy and galaxy cluster counts .",
    "an alternative method of spectrum normalization , which is nonetheless consistent with the above , is based on referencing to cmb fluctuations , because they are closely related to dark matter density fluctuations .    according to the cmb anisotropy data , it is convenient to normalize the curvature perturbation spectrum [ 2 ] as @xmath83 where @xmath84  mpc@xmath18 , @xmath85 is the present - day value of the scale factor , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 according to the wmap data [ 32 ] and @xmath88 according to the planck data [ 33 ] . here , the typical perturbation amplitude is @xmath89 .",
    "with only low multipoles used in the cmb power spectrum , the wmap data [ 32 ] correspond to the constant @xmath67 with an accuracy @xmath90 , but taking higher multipoles into account shows a ( presently statistically insignificant ) tendency of decreasing @xmath67 toward small scales , @xmath91 .",
    "the planck data [ 94 ] also point to a statistically insignificant ( at a level of @xmath92 ) decrease in @xmath67 , @xmath93 .",
    "if such a decrease actually takes place , small - scale clumps form with a smaller efficiency than for the constant @xmath94 .",
    "the rms amplitude of density perturbations normalized to the cmb data on the horizon scale at the radiation- dominated stage has the form [ 95 ] @xmath95 for @xmath96 , the mean amplitude of perturbations decreases with decreasing the mass .",
    "nevertheless , clumps can be formed before galaxies due to the transfer function @xmath51 , which for not too small @xmath67 leads to an rms perturbation increase with decreasing the mass . for estimates , it is useful to write the mean value of perturbations on scales @xmath97 at the time of transition to the dust - like stage @xmath98 : @xmath99^{\\frac{3}{2}}. \\label{a5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be seen that for @xmath100 , the logarithmic term in the transfer function is very important .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the use of the spectrum normalized to the cmb data assumes a huge extrapolation , by more than 15 orders of magnitude .",
    "such an extrapolation is justified for inflation models that give power - law spectra in a wide range of scales .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the predictions of inflation models for small scales have not been confirmed by observations so far .",
    "therefore , to a large extent , the shape of the spectrum remains a `` free parameter '' .",
    "if the existence of small - scale clumps is confirmed ( for example , by observations of dark matter particle annihilation ) , the clump properties can allow determining the shape of the perturbation spectrum on small scales and studying the processes of perturbation generation at the inflation stage .",
    "for example , it will be possible to fix parameters in the lagrangians of the specific field models .",
    "although the perturbation spectrum is sufficiently well known on the scales of galaxies and galaxy clusters , a nonstandard form of the spectrum can not be ruled out on small scales , deviating from the simple power - law dependence and possibly containing local maxima or narrow peaks . as we can see from ( 5 ) , an increase in @xmath101 is possible if the inflation potential @xmath64 has a flat part [ 24 , 96 ] , i.e. , if @xmath102 at some value of the scalar field @xmath103 .",
    "the increase in @xmath101 can occur inside a wide region or in several regions .",
    "the clumps are formed in a broad mass range if the primordial perturbation spectrum has a power - law shape or there is a broad maximum in the spectrum . on the other hand , if the flat part of the potential is local , the clumps are formed near the corresponding mass .",
    "we note that outside these regions , the spectrum can remain close to the harrison - zeldovich one ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "lead to the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the standard way .",
    "a peak at the minimal scale produces clumps with the highest dark matter density in the universe .",
    "the discovery of such clumps could provide invaluable information on the inflation potential .",
    "the presence of peaks can also lead to a more effective formation of pbhs with narrow mass distribution [ 24 , 97 ] .",
    "inflation models with several scalar peaks represent another class of models producing spectra with peaks [ 98 , 99 ] .",
    "theoretical models of non - standard spectra were discussed , in particular , in [ 100 - 102 ] .",
    "an interesting mechanism in which the generation and amplification of perturbations is possible , including the appearance of spectra with peaks , is provided by cosmological phase transitions , for example , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) transition at a temperature @xmath104  mev ( the time instant @xmath105  s ) [ 35 , 37 ] . during the qcd transition ,",
    "the equation of state of matter becomes softer ( the ratio @xmath106 decreases ) , and perturbations grow more efficiently .",
    "however , in the model with a standard ( @xmath107  gev ) neutralino , the peak corresponding to the qcd transition is somewhat flattened in the subsequent evolution due to free - streaming and the corresponding spectral cutoff [ 62 ] .",
    "entropy perturbations can be generated , in particular , in axion dark matter and lead to the formation of axion miniclusters [ 84 , 85 , 104 ] .",
    "primordial black holes and various topological defects can also generate entropy perturbations .",
    "the nature of these perturbations can be illustrated as follows .",
    "we consider a point - like object with a mass @xmath108 on the background of homogeneously distributed dark matter .",
    "we encircle this object by a sphere containing dark matter with a mass @xmath109 . then the effective value of perturbations within the volume of the sphere is @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is obviously dependent on the sphere radius and decreases as the radius increases . for the motion of test particles at the spherical boundary , only the mean value of @xmath111 is important , and the specific density distribution of dark matter inside the sphere does not matter , according to the kirchhoff theorem , if the density distribution is spherically symmetric .",
    "perturbations produced by a seed mass evolve according to the ` secondary accretion ' mechanism [ 76 , 105 , 106 ] .",
    "for example , pbhs or their clusters or cosmic string loops can serve as seed masses .",
    "strongly nonspherical perturbations , which have an entropy nature , can be generated by infinite cosmic strings or textures [ 107 ] . from the standpoint of the evolution of perturbations ,",
    "the difference between entropy perturbations and adiabatic perturbations is in the absence of relatively large initial peculiar velocities of dark matter particles in the entropy perturbations .",
    "the adiabatic perturbation spectrum is bounded by the effect of pbh formation in the early universe , because , for a sufficiently large number of perturbations , an inadmissibly large number of pbhs would be created , in contradiction to observational constraints .",

    "it is clear from ( 8) that perturbations with a simple power - law spectrum and @xmath96 are too small to form clumps at the rd stage .",
    "we note that superdense clumps formed from the spectrum maximum do not aggregate into hierarchical structures for a long time and are therefore almost unaffected by tidal forces , and their mass function is concentrated around some mass corresponding to the spectral maximum .",

    ". such a calculation will be possible once clumps are discovered .",
    "the form of primordial perturbations is typically not spherically symmetric , and the asymmetry can increase with time .",
    "therefore , in studying clump formation , it is necessary to go beyond simple spherical models .",
    "the simplest generalization of the spherical model is the model of a homogeneous ellipsoid ( see its detailed description , e.g. , in [ 128,130 ] ) .",
    "although the homogeneous ellipsoid approximation does not take the density increase toward the center and other inhomogeneities into account , it is useful because it allows taking the evolution of nonsphericity into account in the framework of a simple analytic model , as well as considering the interaction of external tidal forces with the quadrupole moment of the perturbation .",
    "this interaction increases the angular momenta of protogalaxies at their formation stage [ 130 ] .",
    "the evolution of a self - gravitating homogeneous ellipsoid preserves the ellipsoidal form and volume homogeneity of the object , although both the density and the ratio of different ellipsoid axes can change . the initial compression velocities along different ellipsoid axes can be inferred from the peculiar velocities .",
    "the use of the homogeneous ellipsoid model in [ 131 ] to investigate the problem of superdense clump formation at the radiation - dominated stage ( a generalization of the model described in section 3.3 ) allowed finding the growth factor of perturbation nonsphericity @xmath236 .",

    "the shape distribution of gaussian perturbations can be calculated using the results in [ 132 ] or [ 89 , 133 ] .",
    "the closer the perturbation shape is to the spherical one , the more rarely such a perturbation occurs . as a result , for the least dense clumps forming at @xmath239 , the number of clumps decreases by an order of magnitude due to the initial perturbation nonsphericity . for dense clumps that are formed earlier , at @xmath240",
    ", this decrease can be as high as 4 - 5 orders of magnitude .    for objects that are formed at the dust - like stage ,",

    "schechter mass function , and the modified mass function is widely used in theoretical calculations of galaxy and galaxy cluster formation .    another method to go beyond the spherical approximation is to use the lagrangian method to describe the perturbation growth .",
    "the zeldovich approximation [ 134 , 135 ] provides a remarkable example of such an approach .",
    "it allows studying different aspects of three - dimensional compression of dark matter .",
    "the zeldovich approximation was generalized to the evolution at the rd stage in [ 129 ] , where corrections to the linear theory were obtained .",
    "simpler lagrangian approaches are also used , in which the dark matter density growth due to the velocity boost is studied , and gravitational forces are neglected over most of the time of evolution .",
    "this method is used , for example , to study the evolution of clumps from strongly nonspherical topological defects [ 107 , 136 ] .",
    "topological defects ( infinite strings , cosmic string loops , and textures ) are considered as clump seeds in [ 107 ] . moving infinite strings or loops produce a velocity boost for dark matter particles , which leads to the density increase along the trajectories of motion of the topological defects .",
    "we focus on the scenario of clump formation around cosmic string loops , which serve as seeds for entropy perturbations , as described in section  2.4 .",
    "these clumps are formed at the rd stage , and their density can greatly exceed @xmath241 . linear topological defects , cosmic strings , can be formed during the early cosmological phase transitions ( see reviews [ 137 , 138 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the formation of infinite strings , closed string loops can be formed due to string self - crossing [ 139 , 140 ] .",
    "only low - velocity loops can form very dense clumps around them [ 85 ] .",
    "we require the shift of a string , starting from its formation time @xmath242 to its destruction time @xmath243 , to be small in comparison with the loop radius @xmath244 .",
    "for the maxwell loop velocity distribution , the string formation probability satisfying this condition is estimated to be @xmath245 [ 141 ] . however , the requirement of a small shift compared with the loop radius is redundant .",
    "even if it is violated , a clump can be formed , although with a lower mean density [ 136 ] .",
    "clump formation around loops at the rd stage was studied in [ 85 ] using eqn  ( 19 ) . in the approach in",
    "[ 85 ] , the maximum clump density is restricted by the adiabatic expansion of clumps that have already formed due to the evaporation of loops . in [ 141 ] , this density restriction was modified in the case where loop decay occurs before clump virialization .",

    "the loop length distribution is obtained in the form [ 142 ] @xmath247 with @xmath248 .",

    "besides the typical characteristics of clumps , their internal structure is very important , especially in the central core , where dark matter particle annihilation can occur most efficiently due to the high density .",
    "the model of galaxies with a power - law increasing central density profile was elaborated in [ 105 , 106 ] and [ 76 ] in the framework of the `` secondary accretion model '' .",
    "this model assumes that dark matter ` accretes ' onto an initially existing central object , a `` seed mass '' @xmath108 , which can be a compact clump or a black hole .",
    "this central object produces a perturbation @xmath249 , as shown in section  2.4 . in an approximate approach",
    ", the evolution of caustics that arise during gravitational contraction and the crossing of dark matter layers was also discussed in [ 76 ] .",
    "later , the model of a dissipationless gravitational singularity was proposed in [ 55 - 57 ] , which also produces a power - law density profile , and the calculations in [ 55 - 57 ] were performed by a powerful method of adiabatic invariants , enabling the study of evolution in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we note the fundamentally important advantage of the model developed in [ 55 - 57 ] over the secondary accretion models .",
    "as shown in [ 55 - 57 ] , under the action of self - gravity , a density perturbation with an initially smooth profile takes an approximately power - law form without any seed mass : rint @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the clump central density , @xmath252 is the radius at which the density growth stops , @xmath56 is the virial radius or the radius of the last layer that was singled out from the cosmological expansion and stabilized after the nonlinear compression stage , and @xmath253 .",
    "because gaussian primordial density perturbations yield smooth initial conditions , the model in [ 55 - 57 ] describes the physical processes more realistically .",
    "however , so far we have considered the formation of an individual object from an isolated density perturbation .",
    "coalescences of objects during hierarchical clustering can appreciably modify the density profile ( see section  4.9 ) .",
    "the internal structure of the clumps has been studied in many papers , but this problem remains unsolved in one important aspect : which physical process stops the density increase during the clump formation and at what radius ?",
    "the region bounded by a circle of this radius is called the clump core .",
    "the core radius is very important for studying the annihilation signals , and we discuss some processes that are possibly responsible for the central core formation in sections  4.1 - 4.9 .",
    "virialization is the mixing of dark matter streams until the entire halo reaches an equilibrium inside some radius , the so - called virial radius . outside this radius",
    ", the mixing is not completed , and new layers of dark matter , which decouple from the cosmological expansion , continue to fall toward the center .",
    "the virialization occurs due to radial oscillations , the presence of large inhomogeneities , and the nonspherical motions of matter . according to lynden - bell [ 143 ]",
    ", these processes are called `` violent relaxation '' .",
    "the virialization leads to an energy redistribution between different density clumps and between the kinetic and potential energy .",
    "inasmuch as dark matter particles scatter mainly on large clumps and inhomogeneities of matter during ` violent relaxation ' , a nearly maxwell velocity ( not energy ) distribution is established .",
    "the virialization also leads to the tidal destruction of large clumps and their mixing and results in the formation of a sufficiently smooth density profile .",

    ", we reliably assume that most of the mass of dark matter is concentrated in the outer layers , which have just been virialized ; therefore , the contribution of the internal mass to the mean density is not very significant .    initially , the `` violent relaxation '' concept by lynden - bell was based on radial oscillations of an object , which are accompanied by rapid variations of the gravitational potential . as the picture of the hierarchical clustering of large - scale structures emerged , it became clear",
    "that nonradial motions during the aggregation of objects , which represent large inhomogeneities , also produce a variable gravitational potential leading to violent relaxation in the forming halo [ 144 ] .",
    "hierarchical clustering and the relaxation related to it produce , besides virialization , a universal density profile , for example , an nfw one .",
    "according to the results of calculations in [ 145 ] , an instability in the phase space , phase mixing , and a moderate ` violent relaxation ' should be present for the relaxation to begin .",
    "nonradial motions of dark matter particles in the halo play an important role in the relaxation process because these motions lead to dark matter mixing inside each dark matter layer with energy redistribution until the virial equilibrium is reached .",
    "nonradial motions occur due to coalescences of different subhalos , the initial inhomogeneities , and tidal forces from the external mass distribution .",
    "adiabatic capture in the multi - stream regime [ 55 - 57 ] is an important mechanism of energy redistribution between the layers .",
    "although this mechanism operates only in the radial direction , it also leads to the universal density profile @xmath260 in isolated halos .    in a real situation , even in the case of an isolated object formed from a peak in the perturbation spectrum at some scale @xmath45 ,",

    "the virialization of early formed clumps can occur even at the rd stage .",
    "does this process differ from the ordinary violent relaxation at the matter - dominated stage ?",
    "disintegration and dissociation of very irregular halos can be a new feature of the nonlinear evolution of clumps at the rd stage .",

    "numerical simulations , for example , aquarius [ 188 ] ( extensive numerical simulations are sometimes given proper names , such as aquarius , millenium , or aquila ) have revealed the presence of substructures ( clumps ) on mass scales down to @xmath360 , which is the dynamical mass resolution of the calculations .",
    "the obtained clump mass function is @xmath361 , and the fraction of clumped dark matter mass decreases from the periphery to the center .",

    "presumably , the issue can be resolved by assuming that the `` extra '' large clumps form dark galaxies consisting mostly of dark matter , almost without stars .",
    "stars may not have been formed there due to the absence of effective cooling mechanisms of low - mass baryonic halos .",
    "many numerical simulations of large halos in galaxies and galaxy clusters have been performed , but only a few studies have dealt with low - mass clump modelling [ 44,51,77,82 ] .",
    "numerical modelling of small - scale clumps usually stops before the galaxy formation epoch . for example , in [ 51 ] , the calculations are restricted to the redshift interval @xmath362 .",
    "the point is that the modelling space region itself enters the nonlinear regime at @xmath363 ( this occurs quite rapidly , because the perturbation spectrum at small scales is almost flat ) , after which it is already difficult to follow the evolution of small - scale clumps inside this region .",
    "numerical simulations have revealed that the mass function of substellar - mass clumps is close to the power - law form @xmath364 , as obtained in modelling large substructures in galaxies , and these mass functions match quite well when extrapolating to intermediate scales .",

    "the tendency of @xmath35 to increase in passing from clumps formed via hierarchical clustering of small - scale objects to clumps originated from isolated density perturbations was revealed in [ 51 ] .",
    "it was shown that in hierarchical clustering , an nfw profile with @xmath21 at the center and a density profile with @xmath23 at the center are produced from isolated perturbations .",
    "clumps with the minimal mass @xmath39 are also related to clumps formed from isolated perturbations because the perturbation spectrum has a cut - off at smaller masses ( more precisely , the gaussian distribution of perturbations should be taken into account , and therefore even clumps with equal masses @xmath39 can show different properties ) . in [ 51 ] , from the standpoint of density profile formation , the boundary between hierarchical and nonhierarchical regimes was found to be at @xmath368 .",
    "numerical modelling of clumps on galaxy scales revealed the dependence of the concentration parameter @xmath369 in navarro - frenk - white formula ( 45 ) on the halo mass : @xmath370 .",

    "if we ignore this fact and use the mass function @xmath371 , as has been assumed in some papers , then the annihilation signal enhancement by clumps can be overestimated by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude [ 51 ] .    in the calculations in [ 51 ] , caustics",
    "similar to those in the bertschinger [ 76 ] and gurevich  zybin [ 55 - 57 ] models were found in the formed clumps . according to the estimates in [ 51 ] , the presence of these caustics can increase the annihilation luminosity of the clump immediately after formation by a factor of more than 1.5 in comparison with that of a clump with a smooth density profile .",
    "however , the caustic enhancement of the annihilation signal decreases with time , as the caustics are destroyed by dark matter stream mixing inside the clumps .",
    "we emphasize that the problem of the maximum central clump density , or the problem of the core radius in numerical modelling , has not been solved so far , apparently due to the insufficient mass resolution .",
    "simulations in [ 77 ] found a trace of a core with @xmath36 ( see fig .  2 in [ 77 ] ) ; however , in the calculations in [ 51,82 ] , the core was not resolved for @xmath323 as small as @xmath372 .",
    "although the spectrum of perturbations generated at the inflation stage can be extended down to microscopic scales , there are some effects that cut off ( suppress ) the low - scale part of the spectrum at later epochs of cosmological evolution , preventing low - mass clump formation .",

    "neutralinos in the superheavy supersymmetry proposed in [ 22 ] were considered to be superheavy dark matter particle candidates that interacted with radiation at early epochs .",
    "superheavy supersymmetry is a unique renormalizable model that respects unitarity despite the particle masses that are much larger than the electroweak scale .",

    "hierarchical clustering on small scales is a rapid nonlinear process .",
    "the formation of new clumps and their capture by more massive objects occur almost simultaneously .",
    "indeed , it follows from the form of the transfer function @xmath51 that the power - law exponent of the perturbation spectrum on small scales is @xmath523 , and the perturbation @xmath524 is almost independent of @xmath109 .",
    "this leads to a complication in @xmath74-body simulations [ 192 ] .",

    ", the disc is regarded as a collection of stars , and the tidal interaction is calculated in the same way as when the clump flies through an infinite medium consisting of point - like masses ( stars ) , but during the finite time intervals that the clump crosses the disc .",

    "that is , only for clumps with minimal masses at @xmath629 are both contributions comparable , and when the mass and , accordingly , the radius of the clump increase , the collective field effect becomes dominant .",

    "the dark matter particle annihilation is the most important observational signature of the clumps .",
    "the dominance of the central core in the clump annihilation signal is critical for clumps with sufficiently sharp density profiles .",
    "namely , the central core dominates in the annihilation signal in the clump with power - law density profile ( 32 ) if @xmath632 and @xmath633 . more precisely , the value @xmath634 is virtually independent of @xmath126 if @xmath635 . as a result ,",
    "the annihilation luminosity of a clump with a nearly isothermal density profile ( @xmath636 ) is almost constant during the tidal stripping process until the clump radius becomes as small as the core radius .",

    "calculations show that for clumps with @xmath646 , @xmath647 everywhere ( see fig .",
    "clumps from outer regions can even fly inside the bulge .",
    "this means that the clump remnants mostly survive in the tidal interactions in the galaxy .",
    "the probability decreases , @xmath648 , near the galactic center for clumps with @xmath649 .",
    "this can be easily understood because as @xmath650 , we return to the old clump destruction criterion ( 90 ) with the corresponding survival probabilities [ 43,48 ] .",

    ", the mass function would be cut off at the clump core masses .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "10 that the clump remnants exist for @xmath658 . in the bulge near the galactic center ,",
    "the clump remnants are more numerous because of intensive clump destructions in high - density stellar regions relative to the rarefied stellar halo .",
    "the leading contribution to the formation of the mass function tail at low masses is provided by clumps with orbits close to the disc , which suffer stronger destructions .",
    "another important point is the total destruction of clumps whose orbits lie entirely within the bulge . nevertheless , the clump number density in the bulge is nonzero because most of the clumps have orbits extending beyond the bulge .",
    "these `` transit '' clumps spend only a small fraction of their orbital periods inside the bulge and thus avoid total destruction .",
    "particle - antiparticle interaction can result in their annihilation , accompanied by the rest - mass energy transformation into other particles .",
    "for example , if photons are present among the annihilation products , they can in principle be registered by gamma telescopes , which provides information on dark matter particles . unlike charged particles , photons are not deflected by cosmic magnetic fields ; therefore , they should be registered from the directions to the sources , which can facilitate their identification .",
    "the local annihilation rate is proportional to the particle number density squared , and is therefore higher in the central parts of dark matter halos . generally , if any inhomogeneities are present , @xmath659 ;",
    "therefore , inhomogeneities always enhance annihilation signals .",
    "an inhomogeneity can appear as a smooth central density increase [ for example , according to profiles ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) ] or as a collection of chaotic small - scale inhomogeneities on top of this smooth regular density peak .",
    "dark matter in the smooth profile is frequently referred to as the diffuse halo component .",
    "the particle number density in clumps is much higher than in the diffuse component , and hence the clump annihilation signal in many models dominates over the diffuse signal ( usually except in the most dense central core of the halo ) , even if the clumps contain a small fraction of the total halo dark matter .",
    "recently , an excess of gamma rays from the central parts of the galaxy has been reported , which can not be explained by the radiation of ordinary astrophysical sources and can be related to dark matter annihilation .",
    "however , these results have not been reliably confirmed , primarily due to uncertain astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "nevertheless , even an upper bound on the annihilation radiation flux can provide invaluable information on possible dark matter particle parameters .",
    "as far as we know , the idea to use such gamma - ray background constraints was first proposed in [ 212 ] .",
    "the annihilation rate ( the number of annihilated particles , which is equal to twice the number of annihilation events ) in a single clump is given by @xmath660 where @xmath301 is the relative velocity of two dark matter particles with mass @xmath391 , and @xmath661 is the annihilation cross section .",
    "the function @xmath662 in ( 103 ) depends on the dark matter distribution inside the clump .",
    "in particular , @xmath663 in the simplest case where the clump has a constant density , i.e. , @xmath28 at @xmath664 and @xmath665 at @xmath666 , and @xmath667 for the isothermal profile @xmath339 with a small core , @xmath668 .    in expression ( 103 ) , majorana particles are assumed , i.e. , those that are identical to their own antiparticles , @xmath669 , as is the case for neutralinos . for dirac particles , @xmath670 would mean the sum of densities of particles and antiparticles , and the extra factor @xmath671 should be incorporated in ( 103 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath672 can be expressed in terms of the relative velocity @xmath301 of two dark matter particles as @xmath673 where @xmath674 includes only the @xmath675-wave contribution , while b includes contributions from both the @xmath675- and @xmath153-waves . for small velocities",
    "@xmath676 , only the first term can be considered .    in the expression for @xmath672 , averaging over the thermal particle distribution is assumed . as a rule , thermal distributions",
    "are realized in both the early universe and the typical dark matter halo models .",
    "therefore , the expression for @xmath672 is sufficiently universal , and it can be used to connect particle creation in the early cosmological epochs and their annihilation rate in the modern universe . in the case of a strongly anisotropic or nonthermal distribution function , an extra factor of",
    "the order of unity appears in the expression for @xmath672 .",
    "the most probable annihilation channel is into quarks with the subsequent hadronization of the reaction products and the formation of an almost universal continuum annihilation product spectrum .",
    "gamma quanta in this case are generated basically due to neutral",
    "pi - meson decays : @xmath677 where `` all '' means all other annihilation products .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath678 for the differential particle number density of type @xmath679 generated in a single annihilation event with the energy @xmath680 is calculated in [ 213,214 ] , where various analytic approximations are also presented .",
    "an important role in the formation of the annihilation spectrum can be played by the intrinsic bremssrahlung radiation from charged particles that can be present among the intermediate annihilation products . in specific calculations , the dark - susy computer package [ 215 ]",
    "is frequently used , which allows obtaining the cross sections and spectra of the annihilation products in different channels under different assumptions about the supersymmetry model parameters .",
    "some supersymmetry models allow neutralino annihilation predominantly into the lepton channel .",
    "these models were especially invoked in connection with data of the pamela ( payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei in astrophysics ) experiment , which is discussed in detail in section  9 .    in most of the simplest models ,",
    "the main annihilation signal is generated in the continuum , and spectral lines , even if they are present , are suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , the generation of lines , even if of a very low intensity , is possible by neutralino annihilation into two photons , into a photon and a @xmath681 boson , or into a photon and a higgs boson .",
    "the discovery of a narrow spectral line would provide the unique opportunity to extract the signal from the background , because the usual astrophysical sources can hardly generate high - energy spectral lines . in this connection , of great interest",
    "have been the recent claims of observations of a possible line at 130  gev by the fermi - lat ( fermi large area telescope ) instrument from the central region of the galaxy [ 216 , 217 ] , as well as a possible indication of the presence of this line from galaxy clusters [ 218 ] and from some unidentified fermi - lat sources ( see a detailed discussion of these issues , which are highly relevant today , in [ 219 ] ) .",
    "intriguing is the @xmath682 shift of the maximum of the emission from the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "however , the shift is difficult to accommodate in the annihilation scenario , because the off - center dark matter cusp location would lead to its tidal destruction in interactions with the baryonic matter cusp [ 220 ] .",
    "we now consider the sommerfeld enhancement effect , which can significantly boost the particle annihilation cross section at low relative particle velocities , especially inside clumps .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement became very relevant and widely discussed in connection with the pamela experimental results considered in section 9 because this effect only proved to be capable of producing the required boost factor of several orders of magnitude if clumps with masses @xmath683 are present in the galaxy .",
    "that the sommerfeld enhancement plays an important role in the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter particles was first argued in [ 221 , 222 ] .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement , which is an increase in the annihilation cross section , is due to multiple exchanges of intermediate bosons between the annihilating particles .",
    "this exchange , which occurs according to ladder feynman diagrams , corresponds to a certain distortion of the wave function of the annihilating particles due to the presence of an additional interaction potential in the schrodinger equation [ 223 ] . for supersymmetric particles , it is important here that the neutralino belongs to a multiplet of states with close masses , between which co - annihilation occurs . therefore , for example , for a bino , which is a singlet , the sommerfeld enhancement is absent .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement for superheavy neutralinos was considered in [ 181 ] .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement is most frequently modeled by the yukawa potential @xmath684 , where @xmath685 is the mass of the force - carrier particle . in the coulomb limit @xmath686 , the boost coefficient @xmath687 ( the ratio of the perturbative to the nonperturbative annihilation cross sections ) , which is determined by the relation @xmath688 , has the form @xmath689 where @xmath690 . for small @xmath35 , @xmath691 .",
    "however , at very small @xmath35 , of the order of @xmath692 ( in the model with particle masses around 1 tev considered in [ 223 ] ) , saturation occurs , and no cross - section boost occurs upon a further velocity decrease . when changing the ratio between the masses of the dark matter particle and the interaction carrier particle , resonances appear in the annihilation cross section , in which the enhancement coefficient @xmath687 can be as high as @xmath693 [ 223 ] .",
    "in addition , as shown in [ 223 ] , due to the sommerfeld effect , the cross section of the neutralino annihilation into electron - positron pairs is of the same order of magnitude as the cross section of the annihilation into intermediate bosons , whereas in the absence of the sommerfeld effect , the former cross section is suppressed by the factor @xmath694 .",
    "the annihilation products can also be observed indirectly . for example",
    ", the synchrotron radiation of charged particles created in neutralino annihilations can explain the diffuse background radio emission observed by the arcade-2 ( absolute radiometer for cosmology , astrophysics , and diffuse emission 2 ) experiment and by other detectors [ 224 ] .      in searches for dark matter particle annihilation ,",
    "the complicated problem arises of extracting the signal from different backgrounds produced by cosmic rays and usual astrophysical sources .",
    "it is most difficult to determine the interstellar cosmic ray contribution , because the rays propagate far away from their sources and generate diffuse gamma- ray backgrounds when interacting with the interstellar gas and radiation field .",
    "the observed fluxes of cosmic ray charged particles are compared with charge particle fluxes in the secondary generation model developed by ginzburg and syrovatsky [ 225 , 226 ] , and its modern version is conveniently realized in the galprop computer code [ 227 ] .",
    "this model is key in searching for different spectral anomalies that can suggest dark matter particle annihilation .",
    "presently , searches for dark matter particle annihilation are mainly carried out by fermi space gamma - ray observatory ( the former gamma - ray large area space telescope , glast ) , launched in 2008 , and the lat ( large area telescope ) is the main instrument aboard this space gamma - ray observatory . in the gev energy range , fermi - lat has a resolution of about 1 degree , which corresponds to its point - spread function at a level of 68angular size , observed by fermi - lat , can not be considered point - like any more , and the telescope sees only part of their gamma - ray emission in each direction .",

    "we consider the quantity @xmath762 . at @xmath763",
    "it takes the maximum value @xmath764 , which , however , is significantly higher than the fermi - lat resolution .",
    "the annihilation signal from the galactic center depends on the dark matter central density profile .",
    "if there is a density cusp [ 176 ] , a bright source in the center of the galaxy should be present .",
    "however , this cusp in the diffuse dark matter distribution can be smeared out by baryons [ 248 ] .",
    "small - scale clumps are destroyed more efficiently inside the stellar bulge around the galactic center .",
    "it is also possible to observe dark `` gamma - ray '' circles in other galaxies , appearing due to the absence of clumps in the central regions of these galaxies [ 203 ] .",
    "the intrinsic anisotropy of the annihilation signal due to dark matter clustering should also be noted .",
    "the corresponding angular spectrum of the annihilation signal fluctuations at small angular scales is related to the dark matter clump spectrum [ 249 - 252 ] . in principle",
    ", nearby clumps can appear in gamma - ray observations as point - like sources [ 63,72 ] .",
    "some evidence of small - scale anisotropy produced by a population of point - like sources was found in fermi - lat observations [ 253 ] , and it is too early to rule out that some of these sources can be dark matter clumps .",
    "another secondary source of annihilation anisotropy can be the dipole anisotropy due to the motion of the sun in the galaxy ; this effect can easily be observed .",
    "the annihilation signal enhancement in clumps , on the one hand , increases the chances of dark matter annihilation detection ; on the other hand , in some models , the enhance- ment turns out to be so strong that the predicted signal exceeds the observed background constraints , which imposes constraints on the parameters of dark matter particles and clustering .",
    "we first discuss standard neutralinos with a mass of the order of the electroweak scale , which are generated according to the thermal scenario .",
    "we show that if not all of these particles were assembled into superdense clumps at the rd stage , the annihilation flux would exceed the observed background , and therefore this scenario ( superheavy clumps from standard neutralinos ) is ruled out .",
    "we choose the parameters that minimize the annihilation flux and assume the mean neutralino density in the clumps to be the minimal value corresponding to the clump formation at the end of the rd stage , @xmath765 .",
    "then the minimal gamma - ray flux averaged over angles is @xmath766 where @xmath767 is the neutralino mass @xmath391 in units of 100  gev and @xmath768 .",
    "integral flux ( 123 ) is larger than the observed one by five orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the decrease in the number of clumps being formed due to the initial nonsphericity of perturbations turns out to be sufficient to reconcile the theory with observations [ 131 ] .",
    "it is possible to consider more massive neutralinos and to choose the minimum possible annihilation cross section [ 177 ] for the strongly suppressed @xmath675-wave annihilation channel , @xmath769  @xmath335/s .",
    "however , for the dark matter clump fraction fcl51 , the annihilation signal would still be several orders of magnitude higher than the diffusive flux measured by egret and fermi - lat .",
    "this excess was noted in [ 177 ] in the particular case of clumps in the form of `` neutralino stars '' .",
    "the annihilation upper bounds ( in the model of usual neutralinos ) were used in [ 152 , 158 , 159 ] to conclude that the mass fraction of clumps in dark matter is much less than units .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in [ 149 ] from the analysis of the early annihilation effect on the recombination process from cmb measurements . in the standard model of the neutralino ( @xmath770  gev ) , the simple possibility of avoiding the discrepancy with a strong annihilation signal is provided by a small amplitude of perturbations , when no superheavy clumps can be formed .",
    "in particular , the absence of observed point - like gamma - ray sources was used in [ 103 ] to conclude that in the @xmath501-annihilation epoch , the amplitude of the perturbation entering the horizon was less than @xmath771 . in [ 159 ] , additional constraints on clumps were derived from the analysis of dark matter annihilation effects on the reionization of the universe .",
    "we now discuss the annihilation of superheavy particles in superdense clumps .",
    "although the existence of superheavy dark matter particles is theoretically admissible and well justified , their detection appears to be a very difficult problem .",
    "indeed , the creation of such particles in accelerator experiments and their direct registration go far beyond the existing capabilities and those planned for the foreseeable future .",
    "the annihilation rate of such heavy particles depends on mass approximately as @xmath772 .",
    "because the back - ground radiation , such as cosmic rays from astrophysical sources and the diffusive flux of gamma - ray photons , decreases with energy only as @xmath773 with @xmath774 as the particle mass increases , the indirect detection of dark matter particles seems to be more and more an impossible task .",
    "one possibility enabling us to overcome this difficulty is the formation of a superdense core in clumps [ 255 ] . in [ 255 ] , with the aim of explaining the origin of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays [ 256 ] , superheavy dark matter particle annihilation in the dense central part of the clumps was discussed as an alternative to scenarios with superheavy particle decays [ 20 , 21 ] .    another possibility is the annihilation in superdense clumps considered in [ 164 , 181 ] . in sufficiently dense clumps , relaxation due to two - particle gravitational scattering can initiate the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' , and the clump density profile can be transformed into the isothermal profile @xmath339 with a very small core radius .",
    "this is the case for the superheavy bino . due to the density increase ,",
    "dark matter annihilation is substantially enhanced . unlike the bino , the vino and higgsino",
    "are strongly coupled to the thermal plasma ; therefore , no gravothermal catastrophe is occurs .",
    "virial velocities of dark matter particles in superdense clumps are very small , which leads to the sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation rate of the vino and higgsino . with this effect taken into account",
    ", the annihilation flux from superheavy dark matter particles was shown in [ 164 , 181 ] to be at the observable level for all types of superheavy neutralinos .",
    "neutralino annihilation in superdense clumps around cosmic string loops was analyzed in [ 141 ] .",
    "the formation of such clumps was discussed in section 3.5 . a comparison of the calculated signal with fermi - lat data treated as the upper bound allows constraining the properties of cosmic strings and dark matter particles .    to conclude this section , we mention three other possible annihilation effects . charged particles created by",
    "the particle annihilation in clumps can form additional inhomogeneities in interstellar magnetic fields , which can affect the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient [ 257 ] .",
    "the annihilation of neutralinos at redshifts @xmath282 can substantially change the thermal balance of gas in the universe , whereas this process without clumps is ineffective [ 258 ] .",
    "the annihilation in clumps can also affect the reionization history of the universe [ 259 ] .",
    "as early as 1994 , the balloon experiment heat ( high energy antimatter telescope ) discovered a small excess of @xmath775 in the energy range 6 - 10  gev , possibly suggesting dark matter particle annihilation .",
    "the excess of @xmath775 with the same energies was detected in the ams-01 ( alpha magnetic spectrometer 01 ) experiment .",
    "this positron excess in the energy range 6 - 10  gev was not confirmed by later experiments , but `` instead '' new results suggested an excess of positrons at higher energies .",
    "the pamela detector aboard the russian satellite resurs - dk1 for studying the charged component of cosmic rays was launched into orbit on 15 june 2006 .",
    "it can register positrons and protons in cosmic rays .",
    "the 2008 data release revealed an excess of @xmath775 in the energy range 10 - 60  gev , where no solar modulation is expected . in a short time , this excess was reliably confirmed up to 90  gev .    over 850 days of observations from july 2006 to december 2008 , the pamela detector registered @xmath776 antiprotons with energies from 60 to 180 gev ; this antiproton flux , up to model and experimental errors , is in good correspondence with the secondary generation of protons in cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar gas [ 260 ] . in particular , the pamela data reproduce the expected shape of the spectrum with a maximum at about 2  gev .",
    "thus , the excess of @xmath775 observed by pamela is not associated with the excess of @xmath777 .    the atic ( advanced thin ionization calorimeter ) balloon - borne experiments revealed the presence of an excess of electrons with energies @xmath778  gev , with a sharp cut - off at higher energies . because electrons can easily be absorbed by the interstellar gas",
    ", such an excess can be produced only by a nearby source .",
    "the results of measurements in different experiments significantly differ in some energy ranges .",
    "the flux of electrons measured by atic somewhat exceeds the standard model prediction , while the pamela measurements below 625  gev are in agreement with the standard generation model [ 261 ] .",
    "the pamela data look somewhat more convincing because the pamela detector provides good magnetic separation of particles , has a larger volume calorimeter than atic , and is equipped with a neutron detector ; in addition , the pamela data are visually scrutinized at the final stage .",
    "pamela also provided the best constraints to date on antideuterium and antihelium fluxes , except in some energy ranges where more stringent bounds are provided by the bess ( balloon - borne experiment with a superconducting spectrometer ) experiment .",
    "these constraints are interesting from the dark matter standpoint , because @xmath779 and @xmath780 pairs can , with some probability , be created by dark matter particle annihilation .",
    "recently , in the ams-02 experiment aboard the international space station , an excess of the positron fraction at energies up to 350  gev was reported [ 262 ] , and thus the pamela results were confirmed and extended toward higher energies .",
    "dark matter particle annihilation provides an explanation for the observed e ?",
    "excess in the pamela experiment .",
    "this hypothesis has been widely discussed , suggesting indirect registration of dark matter .",
    "discussions of the annihilating dark matter in connection with the pamela data made these studies very topical and stimulated detailed investigations of the neutralino models , accurate calculations of the annihilation cross sections and the annihilation product spectra , etc .",
    "models with decaying dark matter particles have also been discussed .",
    "it should be noted from the very beginning that simpler astrophysical explanations have been immediately suggested ( see section  9.3 ) , and the dark matter model is presently not considered to be the lead one .    explaining the pamela results by the annihilation of ordinary neutralinos generated by the thermal mechanism requires invoking a significant boost factor , because the annihilation cross section is determined by the neutralino generation model , and this cross section is too small to create the observed charged particle flow .",
    "as we know , high - density clumps can increase the boost factor [ 263 ] . because the particle velocity dispersion in the clumps is low ,",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement and radiation corrections , which can increase the annihilation cross section by several orders of magnitude , are equally important .",
    "they can increase gamma - ray and positron fluxes due to annihilation [ 264 ] .",
    "earlier explanations of the heat results by neutralino annihilation also required a boost factor of the order of 30 .",
    "thus , apparently , neutralino annihilation can easily explain the pamela data .",
    "however , this scenario runs into a serious difficulty . as noted in section 9.1",
    ", pamela observations do not show the antiproton excess , whereas typical annihilation models predict the generation of positron and antiproton excesses simultaneously .",
    "this problem is pertinent to the boost factor produced due to both clumps and other possible sources , i.e. , the problem is inherent to the annihilation scenario in general , irrespective of the clump models .",
    "another major problem arises in relation to the fermi - lat flux bounds from dwarf galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "these bounds strongly constrain or ( in the most typical models ) exclude the pamela data interpretation of the neutralino annihilation .",
    "the point is that for the positron flux registered by pamela to be produced , the annihilation cross section must be so large that the gamma - ray signal from dwarf galaxies and clusters should necessarily be observed .",
    "this problem is to a great extent dependent on the annihilating particle model , namely , on the predominant annihilation channels . in the simplest case of the usual neutralino , the dark matter annihilation model as an explanation of the pamela results",
    "can already be excluded due to the absence of antiprotons and disagreement with fermi - lat observations , but hypothetical variants with suppressed annihilation into gamma - ray photons and antiprotons are still possible .",
    "for example , the annihilation into lepton channels only was considered in [ 265 ] , and a model invoking the dark sector was studied in [ 266 ] .    a sufficiently good correspondence of the calculations with the atic data can be obtained in the annihilation model for kaluza - klein particles with masses @xmath781  gev [ 267 ] .",
    "it can be supposed that atic discovered a sufficiently close clump in which annihilation occurs [ 268 ] , or the annihilation is under way in a dense density peak around an intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "we note , however , that dark matter particles of one sort are unlikely to simultaneously explain both pamela and atic results , although attempts have been made to develop a unified model .",
    "the simplest explanation of the positron excess observed by pamela is provided by the assumption that cosmic ray propagation and secondary generation models are incomplete [ 269 ] .",
    "the corrected model in [ 269 ] corresponds to the observed positron excess if the additional positrons result from the annihilation of vino - like neutralinos with masses of 180  gev , which were produced in the early universe by a nonthermal mechanism [ 270 ] .",
    "the @xmath775 excess registered by pamela together with the absence of the corresponding antiproton excess can be explained by the generation of electrons and positrons in pulsars .",
    "however , these models encounter difficulties because reproducing different parts of the @xmath775 spectrum requires assuming different pulsar model parameters ; in other words , to reach agreement with observations , the summation of fluxes from several pulsars with different properties is required .",
    "a similar explanation of the atic results also meets with difficulties , since the electron spectra generated by neutron stars and micro - quasars are different from the observed one .",
    "an interesting solution can be found in the framework of the model of generation of an @xmath775 excess in the processes @xmath782 during flares on dwarf main - sequence stars , which are the most numerous stars in the galaxy .",
    "it is known from astronomical observations that low - mass stars have quite unsteady photospheres , in which very powerful flares , much more powerful than solar flares , occur .",
    "calculations [ 271,272 ] indicate that stellar flares could reproduce the observed @xmath775 excess .",
    "this model is attractive because it does not postulate any new phenomena and is based only on the known astrophysical processes .",
    "finally , a simple and elegant solution of the @xmath775 excess problem is given in [ 273,274 ] , where the secondary positrons are assumed to be generated and accelerated by cosmic - ray sources themselves .",
    "this model successfully reproduces the observed @xmath775 spectrum with no antiproton excess and well - studied energy ranges .",
    "a concern may arise only with nuclei and antiprotons at very high energies ( @xmath783  gev ) , although the reality of such concerns has not been confirmed by specific calculations , and the observational accuracy at these energies is still poor .",
    "the probability that earth is now inside a dark matter clump is estimated to be from 0.0001% [ 211 ] to 0.1% [ 68 ] , depending on the clump mass and the assumed perturbation spectrum .",
    "if such a rare event is indeed taking place now , the probability of direct and indirect dark matter particle detection should be much higher [ 68 ] .",
    "it was concluded in [ 40 , 203 ] that almost all clumps in the galaxy are tidally disrupted in interactions with stars . as shown in section  7.3 , for a significant fraction of clumps , tidal interactions with stars",
    "indeed lead to stripping off their outer layers , i.e. , to a substantial mass loss , but this does not imply total clump destruction , because the clump cores can survive [ 83 , 263 ] . the stripped mass is transformed into `` ministreams '' of dark matter [ 40 , 203 , 263 ] . for the direct experimental detection of dark matter , the ministreams are interesting because dark matter particles in them move along several different discrete directions corresponding to the progenitor clumps before the destruction . according to [ 211 ] , presently some @xmath784 ministreams may be crossing earth .",
    "the ministream formation and evolution during clump destructions by stars were also addressed in [ 41 ] .",
    "dark matter in the streams spreads in the space like a broad tail , and therefore the probability of a ministream colliding with earth is much higher than that of the entire clump crossing .",
    "it has been argued in some papers that the planned gravitational - wave detectors like lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) can measure small variations of the gravitational field caused by nearby flying compact objects .",
    "lisa was supposed to search for pbhs [ 275 ] , asteroids [ 276 ] , or compact dark matter objects of an unknown nature [ 277 ] .",
    "clumps can be included into this list .",
    "a detectable signal is produced by the tidal gravitational force , which changes the interferometer arm length and , accordingly , causes a phase shift . using lisa , it is possible to search for compact objects in the mass range @xmath785  g@xmath786  g according to [ 275 ] , or @xmath787",
    "g@xmath786  g according to the calculations in [ 277 ] .",
    "the signal is expected to consist of single pulses with the characteristic frequency near the low - frequency sensitivity limit of lisa , and the event rate of these signals can be @xmath788 per decade , assuming that such objects constitute most of the dark matter . in the usual scenario ,",
    "the clump fraction is only 1%-10% of all dark matter and hence the clump detection rate should be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower .",
    "in addition , the radii of such clumps , as a rule , are much larger than the lisa arm length @xmath789  cm , and therefore the tidal force amplitude is smaller .",
    "hence , the detection of standard clumps by lisa seems to be unlikely .",
    "the next generation of gravitational - wave detectors opens more possibilities ( see [ 275 ] for more details ) .",
    "superdense clumps , due to their compactness , easily meet the condition @xmath790  cm in the mass range @xmath787  g@xmath786  g , and these clumps , if they exist , can be detected by lisa .",
    "to explain microlensing events observed in the galaxy halo , gurevich , zybin , and sirota were the first to propose the model of gravitationally bound noncompact clumps ( self - gravitating clumps ) with a mass @xmath791 consisting of weakly interacting dark matter particles [ 166 ] .",
    "because the main dark matter particle candidate was the neutralino , such clumps were dubbed `` neutralino stars '' .",
    "it was also noted that the neutralino stars produce a very strong annihilation signal even for a very large core size , @xmath792 , and in order to not violate the observational limits , the neutralino was postulated to annihilate with a small cross section in a p - wave .",
    "neutralino stars with a very small core radius complying with the annihilation limits were then considered in [ 177 ] ; it was shown that in this case , too , the annihilation signal is expected to significantly exceed the observational constraints , even by assuming the minimum possible annihilation cross section available in supersymmetry models .",
    "the criterion for clump formation from adiabatic density perturbations with pbh constraints taken into account was improved in [ 88 ] . in particular , it was shown there that to make compact gravitational lenses , the clumps should be produced as early as at the radiation - dominated stage ( although at its end ) .",
    "hence , neutralino stars can be qualified as the superdense clumps considered in section 3.3 . for their formation , a maximum should exist in the standard power - law density perturbation cosmological spectrum .",
    "the results in section  3.3 suggest that in the case of adiabatic perturbations , the existence of such a maximum would inevitably lead to the creation of a significant number of pbhs with masses @xmath793 at the rd stage .",
    "the authors of [ 166 ] also noted that the baryonic core , if formed inside clumps , should modify the microlensing light curve by the clumps . in later studies [ 157 , 159 , 160 ] , the clumps were also regarded as microlensing objects .",
    "two types of clumps were analyzed in [ 157]:minihalos around pbhs and clumps without central pbhs .",
    "the substellar mass clumps in other galaxies can in theory be detected in gravitational lensing observations of quasars in these galaxies [ 279 , 280 ] .",
    "gravitational lensing of type - ia supernovae also yielded constraints on the dark matter clumping [ 281 ] .",
    "some clumping constraints can also be derived from pulsar timing observations , because the gravitational field of clumps located near the line of sight must produce delays in the time of arrival of periodical signals from pulsars [ 282 ] .",
    "figure 13 displays microlensing constraints obtained by the macho ( massive astrophysical compact halo object ) project , as well as femto- and picolensing constraints obtained from gamma - ray burst observations [ 118 ] .     from microlensing macho observations , as well as from femto- and picolensing observations of cosmic gamma - ray bursts [ 118].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we note that the problem of microlenses has become less relevant now because all microlensing events can be explained by stars .",
    "however , the microlensing observations can be used to impose upper bounds on the number of pbhs and superdense dark matter clumps in some mass ranges , thus constraining the primordial perturbation spectrum on the corresponding scales .    as shown in [ 166 ] , a clump can serve as a gravitational lens and explain the observed microlensing events only if its radius is less than 10 times the einstein radius for this object .",
    "this condition implies very stringent constraints on the nonlinear compression of clumps .",
    "it turned out [ 88 ] that clumps can be gravitational lenses only for the high pbh formation threshold @xmath794 obtained in the model of the critical gravitational collapse , whereas the clump model of microlensing objects is excluded for lower values of @xmath795 .",
    "dissipative processes in the baryonic gas inside dark matter clumps were studied in [ 166 ] and in the clumps around pbhs , in [ 283 ] .",
    "it was concluded in [ 166 ] that the settling of baryons toward the clump center causes the dark matter density to increase as well , which enhances its particle annihilation rate .",
    "in addition , it was noted that the baryonic core modifies the microlensing light curve of the clumps .",
    "however , we note that it is hard to expect a noticeable baryonic flux toward substellar - mass clumps , because virial temperatures in the clumps are too low for the effective baryon cooling to operate . additionally , due to compton scattering of cmb photons , baryons can not be accelerated to virial velocities in clumps ; therefore , it is hard to expect the enhancement of baryonic accretion at high redshifts . in particular ,",
    "baryons from almost homogeneous low - density surroundings can be accreting onto the clumps around pbhs [ 283 ] .",
    "sufficiently heavy clumps with masses @xmath796 that form potential wells into which baryons are collected to form early population - iii stars were studied in [ 157,284 ] .",
    "these stars can be responsible for the reionization of the universe at @xmath797 .",
    "the annihilation of dark matter particles captured by a star in the central part of a clump can significantly contribute to the energy balance of the star and affect its evolution [ 285,286 ] .",
    "clumps with masses @xmath798 can be manifested in 21  cm atomic hydrogen line observations by producing temperature fluctuations in the baryonic gas .",
    "if a signal from nearby clumps is detected , it will be possible to measure the proper motions of the clump in the sky , as in astrometric observations of nearby stars [ 69,72,288,289 ] .",
    "however , as shown in [ 289 ] , the possibility of observing proper motions is limited by annihilation gamma - ray constraints from the galactic center and other sources .",
    "the nearby clumps and their proper motion can be detected only for a large annihilation cross section .",
    "but then the signal from other sources would violate the existing observational bounds . however , we note that this effect is strongly dependent on the sensitivity and angular resolution of gamma - ray telescopes , and the calculation in [ 289 ] was done using the fermi - lat parameters",
    ". clearly , with instrumental and observational progress , it may be possible to simultaneously measure the proper motion of clumps in the sky and annihilation signals from different sources .",
    "small - scale dark matter clumps are interesting to study for several reasons .",
    "these early formed objects can be the densest dark matter objects in the universe ; therefore , the dark matter annihilation in these small - scale clumps can be very effective .",
    "the clumps enable the annihilation signal to be enhanced in galactic halos by several times or even orders of magnitude .",
    "high densities like those in the clumps can appear only in the central dark matter cusps in galactic centers , if the density growth is not stopped at some large radius , or in cusps around central black holes .",
    "thus , the clumps , if they exist , open additional prospects for indirect dark matter detection via the annihilation channel , which may help solve one of the biggest modern mysteries : the nature of dark matter .",
    "if a signal from annihilating dark matter is detected , it will be possible to study the dark matter distribution in greater detail and to obtain information on the primordial perturbation spectrum , from which different - scale structures were formed , as well as to clarify the physics ( shape of the scalar field potential or other characteristics ) of the inflation stage , when these perturbations were generated .",
    "the clumps could shed light on the small scales ( in comparison with the galactic scale ) at which the perturbations were generated at the end of the inflation stage .",
    "annihilation in clumps could change the thermal balance in the gas in the pre - galactic epoch and dramatically affect the evolution of the first stars and hence the chemical evolution of matter in galaxies , the number of pbhs , etc .",
    "the physics of dark matter clumps is also concerned with the problem of small - scale perturbation generation , gravitational dynamics , dark matter particle properties , and the annihilation product effects in the clumps ; it is a truly interdisciplinary field of modern astrophysics and cosmology .",
