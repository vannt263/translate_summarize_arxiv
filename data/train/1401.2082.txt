    "it is well known that classical @xmath0-algebras play an important role in the theory of integrable bi - hamiltonian equations .",
    "one of the most powerful approaches to classical @xmath0-algebras is via the drinfeld - sokolov hamiltonian reduction , @xcite , associated to any simple lie algebra and its principal nilpotent element . later on this theory",
    "was extended to more general nilpotent elements , and it was put by @xcite in the framework of poisson vertex algebras ( pva ) .",
    "however the most important classical @xmath0-algebras , those associated to @xmath3 and its principal nilpotent element , have appeared prior to @xcite together with their deep connection to integrable systems .",
    "they were identified with the so - called second poisson structure of the @xmath1-th ( or generalized ) kdv equations , the kdv equation corresponding to the case of @xmath4 .",
    "the first poisson structure of the kdv equation was found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown by @xcite , that there exists not only a poisson structure but a one - parameter family of compatible poisson structures for the kdv equation . in this case",
    "we say that we have a bi - poisson structure .",
    "the fact that the same equation could be written in two different hamiltonian forms has become fundamental in proving integrability of such equations using a recurrence procedure , nowadays called the lenard - magri scheme of integrability .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath1-th kdv hierarchy was suggested by @xcite who found a poisson structure for these hierarchies , obtained as a poisson algebra on a suitable space of scalar differential operators ( @xmath1 being the order of the operators ) .",
    "a candidate for a second poisson structure ( whence a bi - poisson structure ) was conjectured by @xcite and proved by @xcite .",
    "these poisson structures are usually known as the _ first and second adler - gelfand - dickey ( agd ) poisson structures _ and the second one is a special case of general classical @xmath0-algebras .    later on ,",
    "all the @xmath1-th kdv hierarchies were `` embedded '' into one big hierarchy called the kp hierarchy , @xcite . a poisson structure for this hierarchy ( which was a slight modification of the agd poisson structure )",
    "was suggested by @xcite , and @xcite proved that there exists a second poisson structure .",
    "in fact , it was shown by @xcite that , for any @xmath5 , there is a bi - poisson structure for the kp hierarchy which induces the bi - poisson structure for the @xmath1-th kdv hierarchy .",
    "we refer to the book of @xcite for a detailed exposition of these topics and a large list of references .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to give a poisson vertex algebra interpretation of the agd approach to classical @xmath0-algebras .",
    "this point of view greatly simplifies the theory and also allows to study its matrix generalization .",
    "let @xmath6 be a differential algebra with derivation @xmath7 .",
    "following @xcite , given a pseudodifferential operator @xmath8 , we define the corresponding _ adler map _ @xmath9 given by , and the associated skewadjoint matrix differential operator @xmath10 with coefficients in @xmath6 , given by .",
    "in theorem [ l - c ] we consider the algebra @xmath11 of differential polynomials on the differential variables @xmath12 and the pseudodifferential operator @xmath13 , and we prove that , in this case , the corresponding 1-parameter family of matrices @xmath14 gives a bi - poisson structure on @xmath11 .",
    "theorem [ l - c-2 ] is the analogous result for the algebra @xmath15 of differential polynomials in finitely many variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "also in this case we get a bi - poisson structure on @xmath15 .",
    "this is the classical @xmath0-algebra associated to the lie algebra @xmath18 and its principal nilpotent element .",
    "furthermore , performing dirac s reduction by the constraint @xmath19 , we obtain bi - poisson structures on @xmath20 and on @xmath21 ( the latter is the classical @xmath0-algebra for @xmath3 ) .    in section [ sec : hierarchies ] we associate to each of these bi - poisson structures the corresponding integrable hierarchy of bi - hamiltonian equations , using the lenard - magri scheme : on @xmath22 we obtain the kp hierarchy , while on @xmath23 we obtain the @xmath1-th kdv hierarchy .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sub : extra2 ] we use the adler map to define natural pva homomorphisms @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are a generalization of the usual `` miura map '' , @xcite .",
    "this allows us to give another proof of the theorem of @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of our approach is that all the above constructions and proofs extend in a straightforward way to the case when the variables @xmath26 are replaced by @xmath27 matrices @xmath28 .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : matrixagd ] , where , as a result , we construct the matrix kp and @xmath1-th kdv bi - hamiltonian equations .",
    "the main difference with the scalar case is that , in the matrix case , dirac reduction ( developed by @xcite ) by the constraint @xmath29 leads to a non - local bi - poisson structure .",
    "these non - local poisson structures have been discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then need to use the theory of non - local poisson structures introduced by @xcite , and the machinery of rational matrix pseudodifferential operators developed by @xcite , to prove integrability of the matrix @xmath1-th kdv hierarchy .",
