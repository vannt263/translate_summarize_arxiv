    "after the first all - sky radio surveys were conducted in the late 1950s , @xcite found the first quasar in a point - like optical counterpart for a 3c radio object and also noted that several 3c objects exhibited continuum brightness fluctuations .",
    "however , it was not until ten years later that it was suggested that quasars might be detected solely by means of this intrinsic variability @xcite .",
    "another decade passed before the first sample of quasars discovered solely by their variability was assembled @xcite .",
    "over the past two decades , more than a dozen major surveys have been carried out on the variability of optical- or radio - selected samples of quasars ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "depending on the exact selection criteria used and the photometric accuracy and limiting magnitude of the survey , results range from 50% of quasars exhibiting variability of at least 0.15 magnitudes on a two - year time scale @xcite to practically all quasars exhibiting variability of at least 0.05 magnitudes on a 15-year time scale @xcite .",
    "other studies , using proper motion in addition to variability as selection criteria ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , find that @xmath3 of their sample of quasars show detectable variability with approximately @xmath4 mag photometric accuracy over a baseline of 14 years @xcite and all quasars exhibit variability over a 16-year baseline @xcite .",
    "the major difference between quest and these previous quasar variability studies is that we are using the variability of quasars as measured by quest as a means of discovery rather than using a known sample of quasars to study their variability characteristics .",
    "in addition to quest , there exist other current large - scale surveys which are making significant advancements in the discovery and study of quasars , both through means of variability and through chromatic selection processes . recently",
    ", macho @xcite and ogle @xcite have found quasars behind the magellanic clouds by means of their intrinsic variability . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( eg .",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has also made great strides in increasing the number of known quasars .",
    "the time domain , however , has not to date been sampled as robustly by sdss as by quest .",
    "sdss has at most a handful of observations of any given area on the sky .",
    "in contrast , quest has sampled a smaller area ( roughly @xmath5 ) on the high galactic latitude sky as frequently as two times per night over the course of three observing seasons , capturing 69 images of the same region .",
    "it is with the quest repeat observations and more robust light curves that we are able to investigate a realm of phase space distinct from other quasar surveys .",
    "this work investigates the notion that _ all _ quasars , by nature of their presumed central engine , vary in brightness at some level on a time - scale of a few to several years ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of agn central engine variability ) .",
    "as more and more all - sky surveys are undertaken and as cosmological tests use quasars as a means to compute cosmological parameters , it becomes paramount to understand the selection effects and biases of existent quasar catalogs . by comparing quasar catalogs compiled via optical colors or radio flux to a sample of quasars collected from achromatic processes such as variability or proper motion",
    ", we can better ensure that we have a homogenous sample of quasars with understood biases .",
    "this paper reports on the quasars that were found by quest via photometric variability and spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "the details of the data reduction and analysis and the variability criteria are discussed in a subsequent paper @xcite .    in  2",
    ", we discuss the photometric and spectroscopic data collection . ",
    "3 discusses the variable quasars in the survey region , both those confirmed by this work and those previously cataloged .",
    " 4 discusses the findings and introduces some ideas for future work in this area and  5 presents our conclusions .",
    "the quest phase 1 camera @xcite is installed on the 1m - schmidt telescope at the llano del hato observatory , venezuela .",
    "the camera consists of 16 ( a 4x4 array ) front - illuminated 2048 x 2048 15  pixel ccds .",
    "the camera is situated at the prime focus of the schmidt telescope . with a focal length of 3 meters ,",
    "the plate scale is approximately 103 per pixel . due to gaps between each row of four chips ,",
    "the camera has a total field of view of 24  x  35 and a total sky coverage of @xmath6 .",
    "the telescope is normally operated in drift scan mode , remaining parked at a fixed hour angle ( ha ) , but not necessarily ha = 0 .",
    "the ccd chips are then clocked out at the sidereal rate to prevent images from blurring across the chip .",
    "this observing procedure allows for an integration time of 143 seconds for each chip along the celestial equator and results in limiting magnitudes of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 at a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 @xcite .",
    "each row of four chips has a broadband filter placed over it .",
    "every object passing across the chip array can therefore be imaged through up to four different broadband filters .",
    "the variability scans used a set of r , b , r , v ( refer to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed reviews of quest and the phase 1 camera ) .      to date",
    ", the quest variability survey has 69 usable scans of varying quality .",
    "these scans cover a strip of sky approximately 24 wide in declination ( centered at -1 ) and @xmath10 hours wide in right ascension at high galactic latitude ( @xmath11 ra @xmath12 ) .",
    "all scans were taken over the course of three observing seasons at the llano del hato observatory .",
    "( 1999 february - march , 2000 february - march and 2001 march - april ) .    using a suite of custom software , data reduction , object detection ,",
    "astrometry and aperture photometry were performed and a catalog for each night was created .",
    "a series of cuts and tests were made on objects from each individual night .",
    "objects were matched together among all the scans and a second series of tests and cuts were performed on the ensemble of objects and exposures . an ensemble photometric solution was used to determine a list of variability candidates based on the confidence level ( cl ) , i.e. , the percentage chance that an object is not variable due to random fluctuation .",
    "this algorithm is performed on each chip individually .",
    "after passing all of the above tests and cuts , the results from the individual chip solutions are used to compile a final list of variable objects .",
    "whether an object is ultimately determined to be variable depends both on the number of chips on which it was detected and the subset of those chips on which it was seen to vary . as a self - consistency check , any object detected on two or more chips is required to vary on _ at least _ the two r chips to be included in the variable object list .",
    "any object only detected on one chip is disregarded , regardless of its variability characteristics .",
    "two lists of variables were compiled for each of the two time baselines : one list of objects which varied as described above at the 95% cl and a list of objects which varied at the 85% cl . with 13 months of data , a total of 301,472 ensemble objects were detected .",
    "out of those objects , 2,631 were variable at the 85% cl and 1,580 were variable at the 95% cl . with the addition of another epoch of data ,",
    "the baseline expanded to 26 months and 280,538 ensemble objects were detected , 2,051 of which were accepted at the 85% cl and 1,356 of which were accepted as variables at the 95% cl . while leaving the details of the data reduction algorithms and candidate selection process to be presented in @xcite , it is worth noting that the slight difference in the number of detected objects in the 13-month and 26-month data sets is due to a cut in the data which required an object to appear on a minimum percentage of the valid exposures .",
    "lightcurves for two representative variability candidates which were later confirmed as quasars are given in fig.[lc ] .",
    "note the characteristic variability signature , which in both cases exhibits low - level fluctuations on short ( i.e. , monthly ) time scale and larger fluctuations on an annual time scale .",
    "once all the variable objects were identified , the next step was to separate the quasars from stars and other variable objects . while stellar in appearance",
    ", quasars generally have very distinctive broad emission lines ( bel ) which easily distinguish them from variable stars . in order",
    "to identify which of the objects in the candidate list are quasars , spectra for each of the candidates are required .",
    "this was achieved by using the hydra multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) on the 3.5-meter wiyn telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the mos at wiyn is able to obtain spectra for several dozen objects at once , making it an ideal instrument for identifying large numbers of variable objects .",
    "those objects which are both time - variable and have detectable bel are considered to be quasars .",
    "initial observations were obtained over four nights between 2001 april 17 and april 21 .",
    "the wiyn 316@7.0 grating ( 316 lines per millimeter with a blaze angle of @xmath13 and a plate scale of approximately @xmath14 nm per pixel ) was used to obtain low resolution spectroscopy over a wide range of wavelengths ( @xmath15 nm @xmath16 nm ) .",
    "the gg-420 filter was used to filter out light shortward of @xmath17 nm , avoiding overlap with the second - order spectra in the blue .",
    "the spectra are limited on the red end by both the decreased quantum efficiency of the detector beyond @xmath18 nm and the large amount of atmospheric contamination in the near infrared .",
    "the hydra fields were selected from within the photometric scan region based on spatial clumping of variable objects so as to maximize the number of spectra obtained per field .",
    "nine hydra fields were imaged for a total of one hour each ( @xmath19 exposures @xmath20 min .",
    "these 9 fields cover approximately @xmath21 of the sky and contain a total of 248 candidate objects . of these 248 candidates , 17 ( @xmath22 )",
    "were determined to be quasars .",
    "additional observations were obtained over three nights between 2002 february 14 and february 16 .",
    "the hydra configuration described above for the 2001 observing run is identical to the configuration used during the 2002 observing campaign .",
    "twelve hydra fields were imaged for a total of one hour each ( @xmath19 exposures @xmath20 min .",
    "these 12 fields cover approximately @xmath23 of the sky and contain 203 candidate objects .",
    "of these 203 candidates , 15 ( @xmath24 ) were determined to be quasars .",
    "table[fields ] reports the details for each of the fields observed during both observing runs .",
    "each spectrum is classified as one of the following : a quasar ( q ) , showing distinctive broadened emission lines , a stellar spectrum ( s ) , showing a characteristic blackbody - like curve over the observed wavelength range , an m dwarf star ( m ) , showing the broad molecular absorption bands characteristic of cool m stars , and spectra with low or no noticeable signal or those that do not otherwise fit into the three categories ( ? ) described above .",
    "the spectroscopic data were reduced and analyzed using the _ dohydra _ iraf package .",
    "two representative spectra , corresponding to the light curves shown in fig.[lc ] , are presented in fig.[spectra ] .",
    "both show the prominent broadened emission lines used to identify the quest variable quasars .",
    "it was possible to study variable quasars in two distinct ways : by spectroscopically confirming a subset of the candidates chosen via photometric variability and by comparing the list of candidates to a catalog of known quasars .",
    "the results of both methods are presented below .",
    "the analysis of the reduced hydra spectra was straightforward .",
    "in essence , it involved the visual inspection of the individual spectra .",
    "a quasar will make itself known with the presence of bel features , generally several hundred angstroms in equivalent width , on top of a roughly power - law continuum emission , which may or may not be in evidence .",
    "( a strong continuum detection is not necessary for confirmation based on the bel . )",
    "a high signal - to - noise composite quasar spectrum from the first bright quasar survey @xcite was used for line identification . in most cases , an estimate of the quasar redshift",
    "can be determined from a visual fitting of the emission features in evidence . comparing emission line centers to line identifications from @xcite",
    ", redshifts were determined to an accuracy of @xmath25 in all cases .",
    "by far the main contribution to redshift uncertainty was the difference in calculated redshifts from multiple emission lines in the same quasar .",
    "care must be taken when considering the redshift of a quasar determined from only one emission line .",
    "mgii is often the only emission line in evidence .",
    "there is a slight , but noticeable blueshift of the mgii line as a function of the quasar color ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "table[qvq ] lists the quest variable quasars discovered ( or re - discovered ) during the 2001 and 2002 spectral observing campaigns at the wiyn telescope .",
    "a total of 30 quasars were discovered during the two spectroscopic observing campaigns . during a subsequent literature search ,",
    "19 of these were found to be previously identified quasars and 11 are new discoveries .",
    "the spectra of each of the newly discovered variable quasars are given in fig.[allspectra ] .",
    "the cross reference information given for previously discovered quasars is obtained with an object - by - object catalog search on the confirmed quasars using the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "if a ned quasar is within @xmath26 of a quest variable quasar , it is considered a rediscovery and the reference to the earliest known publication of that quasar is given . also note that in two instances , a quest variable quasar has been matched to a published sdss object for which there is published photometry , but not a spectrum @xcite . those are noted parenthetically with the sdss photometric classification .    while reserving a full discussion of the selection effects of a variability - selected sample of quasars in relation to those of a uvx- or color - selected sample for a subsequent paper , it is worth commenting briefly on the color information for the subset of quasars in table[qvq ] that also have published sdss photometry .",
    "15 of the 30 variable quasars have published sdss photometry and reliable color data @xcite . of those ,",
    "13 have been marked as quasar targets based on their colors .",
    "of the remaining two , one was initially marked as being explicitly excluded based on its color ( quest j133647.3 - 004856.5 ) but was subsequently considered as a sdss serendipitous target and spectroscopically verified as a sdss quasar and is also listed as an optically - selected lbqs quasar @xcite .",
    "the other quasar ( quest j151631.0 - 000701.9 ) was classified as a photometric extended object by sdss , but not flagged as a quasar candidate based on its colors .",
    "while 15 objects are not sufficient to make any substantive claims on the overlap or inherent selection effects in either selection process , it does begin to hint at the fact that the two populations of quasars are similar , but not identical .",
    "further work and a much larger sample of quasars seen in both surveys will be necessary to make any quantitative claims as to the inherent biases and selection effects ( if any ) in the selection processes .",
    "in the 9th edition of the @xcite , hereafter abbreviated as vc2000 , there are over 13,000 known and cataloged quasars . prior to direct spectroscopic confirmation of the quasar candidates at wiyn , it was possible to test our selection criteria by comparing the vc2000 catalog to the variability - selected candidate list .",
    "vc2000 is a compilation from over 40 sources of published quasar and active galactic nuclei findings .",
    "the 9th edition contains 13,214 quasars , 462 bl lac objects and 4,428 active galaxies and is updated periodically .",
    "@xcite define a quasar as an object that is starlike or has a starlike nucleus , has broad emission lines and has an absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "vc2000 lists j2000 astrometry for each object , as well as redshift , ubv or photographic photometry and radio ( 6 and 11 cm ) flux densities when available .    using only the data from the 1999 and 2000 epochs ,",
    "there are 47 scans covering a time baseline of 13 months . there are 159 vc2000 quasars within the scan region bright enough to be detected in the quest scans and which have a reliable astrometric match with an object in the candidate list . of those 159 quasars ,",
    "141 have sufficient photometry to warrant further consideration ( i.e. , objects that are seen through _ at least _ both r filters ) .    in a previous study , @xcite",
    "indicate that after one year , @xmath28 of a sample of previously known quasars exhibited variability .",
    "following these results , with a time baseline of 13 months and a sample of 159 vc2000 known quasars , it would be expected that @xmath29 of those quasars would exhibit variability .",
    "of the 141 vc2000 quasars under consideration , 53 ( 38% ) meet the variability criteria explained above at the 85% cl with an average redshift of @xmath30 . of those ,",
    "38 ( 27% ) also vary at the 95% cl . these numbers are consistent with the findings of @xcite for a one - year baseline .    with the inclusion of the 2001 epoch data ,",
    "there are now 69 scans covering a total of 26 months .",
    "the structure functions in @xcite and @xcite indicate that quasar variability seems to increase steadily for at least several years in the quasar rest frame . with the caveat of redshift effects on the rest frame time baseline , doubling the time baseline from one year to two years should increase the number of quasars seen to be variable .",
    "@xcite report that @xmath31 of their quasars were seen to vary over a time baseline of two years .    using the same selection and matching criteria as with the 13-month baseline , there are 153 vc2000 quasars which are matched to a quest candidate in the 26-month data .",
    "of those , 137 are seen on both r chips . as with the total number of detected objects ,",
    "the difference in the number of detected vc2000 quasars ( 153 at 26 months versus 159 at 13 months ) is a result of a cut in the data which requires an object to appear on a minimum percentage of the valid exposures .",
    "there are 83 ( @xmath2 ) vc2000 quasars that meet the variability criteria at the 85% cl with an average redshift of @xmath32 , 74 ( @xmath33 ) of which also vary at the 95% cl .",
    "this is consistent with the work done by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , compared to the 13-month data , the incremental increase in the 26-month data between the 85% and 95% cl is much smaller . that is to say , after 2 years",
    ", the vast majority of the variable quasars that were detected are seen to vary at a very high confidence level .",
    "for the purposes of observing strategies and due to the limited telescope time for spectroscopic follow - up attempts , the variability candidate list was limited to those objects which have at least an 85% cl .",
    "however , if the inclusion of vc2000 quasars into the candidate list as a function of cl is analyzed _ a posteriori _ , trends become visible as both the cl and the time baseline change .",
    "fig.[qsopercent ] shows the completeness ( i.e. , the percentage of vc2000 qsos determined to be variable ) as a function of the cl . both the 13-month and 26-month datasets are shown .",
    "two general trends are worth noting . down to a relatively low ( @xmath34 ) confidence level ,",
    "the 26-month data show a higher completeness than the 13-month data .",
    "this is expected , under the assumption that the likelihood of variability increases with time baseline .",
    "while both curves monotonically increase , the 13-month data do not rise as rapidly at high cl and they do not level off through the intermediate cl values , as the 26-month data tend to . in the 13-month dataset , there is no clear distinction between variable and non - variable quasars . a gradually increasing number",
    "are accepted as variable as the cl criterion is loosened .",
    "contrast this with the 26-month dataset , in which there is a high completeness even at a high cl ( over 50% at the 95% cl ) . with the increased time baseline , the vc2000 quasars are beginning to show a marked distinction between variability and non - variability . decreasing the cl cutoff through its intermediate values will not help in obtaining additional vc2000 quasars to the same extent that it does with the 13-month data set .",
    "this conclusion supports our decision to limit the list of candidates for spectroscopic confirmation to a relatively high cl .",
    "the second - generation quest camera has recently been installed on the 48-inch oschin schmidt telescope at palomar observatory and is presently collecting data on both drift scan and ` point and stare ' mode .",
    "the new site and telescope and the new camera design ( 112 thinned ccd chips , @xmath35 pixels , @xmath36 arcsec per pixel ) will all work to improve the photometry to be obtained by quest in upcoming data collection . with the addition of a series of variability scans in the spring of 2004 , the time baseline will increase from 26 months to @xmath37 months . with a roughly @xmath38 increase in baseline and improved photometry , a variability - selected sample will result in a more complete and more efficient list of objects suitable for spectroscopic confirmation as quasars .",
    "it is expected that the separation into a group of ` definitely variable ' qsos and a group of ` definitely nonvariable ' qsos , illustrated in fig.[qsopercent ] , will also grow more distinct .",
    "in addition , the sdss first data release @xcite and the 2df qso redshift survey @xcite will provide a more complete sample of published qso spectra to which to compare the quest variable object list , resulting in more robust statistics concerning the completeness and efficiency of the selection criteria used in this and future work .",
    "future work in this field may also benefit from the study of the light curve itself , either via statistical testing for the time frames that contribute to variability ( eg .",
    "* ) or higher - mode testing for intermittency in a nonlinear signal ( eg .",
    "the addition of a zero proper motion ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) or color - based criteria ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the variability testing are also promising methods of increasing the survey efficiency over variability alone , although understanding the implicit selection effects due to heterogeneous selection techniques may become an issue .",
    "the few subjects touched on in the previous section show that this project lends itself well to future directions for research .",
    "additional epochs of observational data can only improve the search for quasars via variability .",
    "various tests can illuminate the properties of the variable objects already in hand .",
    "however , as a cohesive and complete body of work , this research has proved fruitful and offers its own conclusions .",
    "a three - year campaign of high galactic latitude drift scan observations was carried out at the venezuelan national observatory from february 1999 to april 2001 , resulting in 69 usable observations .",
    "these data were processed and reduced using standard data reduction algorithms , and analyzed for the presence of variable objects .    the total number of ensemble objects dropped from over 300,000 after 13 months to about 280,000 after 26 months .",
    "the 24 scans taken during 2001 march and april effectively doubled the time baseline and increased the total number of scans by approximately 50% .",
    "the additional scans allowed for better statistics in both ensemble object selection and variability determination and also allowed for more reliable rejection of false positives .",
    "in addition , the increased time baseline allowed for a greater fraction of known quasars to be detected as variable objects .",
    "the spectroscopic confirmation of a subset of these variable objects showed that optical variability can be used as a means of discovering , or re - discovering , quasars . during two observing campaigns ,",
    "a total of 30 quasars were detected , 9 of which are new discoveries .    the thirty quasars discovered , or rediscovered , by this survey show variability - selection of quasar candidates to be a qualified success .",
    "both spectroscopic confirmation observing campaigns proved to be more efficient than the statistics of the variable vc2000 qsos predicted . with a time baseline of only 26 months to date , variability as a means of quasar detection is expected to increase in effectiveness as additional epochs of data are added to the quest data . in the meantime , various methods of statstical analysis can be investigated as a means to further improve the efficiency of the spectroscopic observations .",

    "<S> by observing the high galactic latitude equatorial sky in drift scan mode with the quest ( quasar equatorial survey team ) phase 1 camera , multi - bandpass photometry on a large strip of sky , resolved over a large range of time scales ( from hourly to biennially ) has been collected . </S>",
    "<S> a robust method of ensemble photometry revealed those objects within the scan region that fluctuate in brightness at a statistically significant level . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent spectroscopic observations of a subset of those varying objects easily discriminated the quasars from stars . for a 13-month time scale , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 of the previously known quasars within the scan region were seen to vary in brightness and subsequent spectroscopic observation revealed that approximately @xmath1 of all variable objects in the scan region are quasars . increasing the time baseline to 26 months increased the percentage of previously known quasars which vary to @xmath2 and confirmed via spectroscopy that @xmath1 of the variable objects in the region are quasars . </S>",
    "<S> this reinforces previously published trends and encourages additional and ongoing synoptic searches for new quasars and their subsequent analysis . during two spectroscopic observing campaigns , </S>",
    "<S> a total of 30 quasars were confirmed , 11 of which are new discoveries and 19 of which were determined to be previously known . using the previously cataloged quasars as a benchmark , </S>",
    "<S> we have found it possible to better optimize future variability surveys . </S>",
    "<S> this paper reports on the subset of variable objects which were spectroscopically confirmed as quasars . </S>"
