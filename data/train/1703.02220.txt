    "@xcite for @xmath11 .",
    "the almost scale invariant power spectrum suggests that the slow - roll parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are small at the horizon exit , while the duration of inflation is long enough to solve the problems in the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "so it was suspected that there are some relations among the scalar spectral tilt @xmath14 , the amplitude of the scalar perturbation @xmath15 and the number of e - folds @xmath16 before the end of inflation at the horizon exit @xcite .",
    "apparently , the mentioned models above support the inverse relation between @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "because the flatness of the potential is characterized by the slow - roll parameters and the observables are simple functions of the slow - roll parameters to the first order of approximation , we can reconstruct inflationary potentials by parametrizing the observables with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "note that the reconstruction is valid for single field slow - roll inflation only .",
    "since higher order corrections are assumed to be small @xcite , the effects of higher order slow - roll parameters are not considered , but this does not mean that higher order slow - roll parameters are exactly zero . of course , this reconstruction procedure may not work for all potentials @xcite and may not be the good way to probe the physics at the early universe @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of inflationary potentials was first carried out by mukhanov through parametrizing the deviation of the equation of state ( equivalent to @xmath12 ) of the inflaton from the cosmological constant with the inverse power law @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath18 in the mukhanov parametrization were fitted to the observational data in @xcite , and the field excursion of the inflaton in these models was discussed in @xcite . by assuming that both the slow - roll parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 scale as @xmath19 at the leading order in the large @xmath16 limit , roest divided some inflationary models into two universal classes with different behaviors of the scalar to tensor ratio @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the classifications of inflationary models were then generalized to include the parametrization of @xmath21 with the constant , exponential and logarithmic classes @xcite .",
    "the inverse relation @xmath22 can be used to derive @xmath20 @xcite , and the detailed reconstruction of inflationary potentials from the inverse parametrization was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath23 theory of gravity can be written as the scalar - tensor theory of gravity , and through the conformal transformation , the scalar - tensor theory of gravity can be written as the canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the potentials for the higgs and the starobinsky @xmath24 inflations are approximated as @xmath25 $ ] in the einstein frame .",
    "the potentials for the t model and e model have the same approximate behaviors , so they all give the same results on @xmath26 and @xmath20 . for the conformal coupling @xmath4 with @xmath27 , the fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 in different frames are related as @xmath30",
    ", so the t model potential in the einstein frame can be obtained from the monomial potential @xmath31 in the jordan frame @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the same @xmath26 and @xmath20 are obtained from more general potentials @xmath32 with the nonminimal coupling @xmath33 for arbitrary functions @xmath34 in the strong coupling limit @xcite . in general",
    ", it is possible to obtain any attractor from general scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite by varying the khler curvature , we can derive the @xmath0 attractor with @xmath7 and @xmath35 @xcite , and the @xmath0 attractor can also be derived from general scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we combine the idea of reconstruction and attractors from general scalar - tensor theories of gravity to reconstruct the extended inflationary potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give the general formula and procedure for the reconstruction . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the reconstruction for the @xmath0 attractors , and the reconstruction for exponential parametrization is discussed in sec .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec . v.",
    "for the single field inflation , to the first order of slow - roll approximation , we have the relation , @xmath36 so the scalar spectral tilt can be expressed as @xmath37 where the slow - roll parameters @xmath38 note that we take the reduced planck mass @xmath39 . because @xmath40 so @xmath41 where the sign @xmath42 depends on the sign of the first derivative of the potential and the scalar field is normalized by the reduced planck mass @xmath43 .",
    "substitute the relation into eqs . and",
    ", we get @xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 if we parametrize one of the functions as @xmath21 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then we can derive the other functions by using eqs .",
    "( [ nsapproxeq4 ] ) , and ( [ sclreq2 ] ) .",
    "so once one of the functions is parametrized , in principle we can get the observables @xmath26 and @xmath20 , and reconstruct the potential @xmath49 by using the relations ( [ nsapproxeq4 ] ) , , ( [ sclreq2 ] ) and ( [ nsapproxeq6 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we can use the so called @xmath18-function formalism @xcite @xmath50 to reconstruct the potential , where the so called superpotential @xmath51 .    to reconstruct the original potential",
    "@xmath52 $ ] in the jordan frame , we need to have the relation between the potentials in different frames . for a general scalar - tensor theory in the jordan frame @xmath53,\\ ] ] under the conformal transformations , @xmath54d\\psi^2,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we get the usual einstein - hilbet action with a minimally coupled scalar field , @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , once we reconstruct the potential @xmath49 with the relations ( [ nsapproxeq4 ] ) , and ( [ sclreq2 ] ) by parametrizing some functions , then the corresponding potential for the general scalar - tensor theory in the jordan frame is @xmath57 . due to the conformal factor @xmath58 ,",
    "all the potentials @xmath59 correspond to the same potential @xmath49 after the conformal transformation @xmath60 , so we get the same observable @xmath26 and @xmath20 , i.e. , we get attractor . on the other hand ,",
    "to reconstruct the potential @xmath59 , we need to specify the conformal factor @xmath58 and solve eq . to get the relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in general",
    ", it is difficult to obtain an analytical relation .",
    "however , if the contribution from @xmath61 is negligible , i.e. , if the conformal factor satisfies the condition @xmath62 then we get @xmath63 the condition is called the strong coupling limit . in the strong coupling limit , we get @xmath64 in this paper , we reconstruct the potential @xmath59 in the strong coupling limit .",
