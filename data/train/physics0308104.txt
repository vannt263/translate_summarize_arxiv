    "the current best terrestrial limit , over a much shorter time scale of 2 billion years , is @xmath7/yr @xcite , which comes from an analysis of geophysical data obtained from a natural fission reactor at oklo ( gabon ) which operated @xmath8 years ago .",
    "observational measurements like these , however , are subject to numerous assumptions which tend to complicate the interpretation . for example",
    ", questions have been recently raised regarding the reliability of the oklo analysis @xcite .",
    "laboratory searches have numerous advantages , but have , thus far , placed weaker limits on @xmath9 .",
    "for example , a comparison between h - maser and hg@xmath10 gave @xmath11/yr @xcite while a similar comparison between rb and cs microwave clocks yielded @xmath12/yr @xcite .",
    "a limit of @xmath13/yr was obtained from a comparison of a hg@xmath10 optical clock to a cs microwave clock @xcite using a frequency comb .    it has been suggested @xcite that the electric - dipole ( e1 ) transition between two nearly degenerate opposite - parity states in atomic dysprosium ( dy ; z=66 ) should be highly sensitive to variations in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , a recent calculation @xcite supports this conclusion .",
    "an experimental search utilizing these states is currently underway and is discussed here .",
    "we provide an analysis of possible systematic effects and show that this search could ultimately reach a sensitivity of @xmath1/yr .",
    "tests of variation of @xmath0 in atomic systems rely upon the fact that relativistic corrections depend differently on @xmath0 for different energy levels .",
    "the total energy of a level can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the present - day energy , @xmath16 is the present - day value of the fine structure constant , and @xmath17 is a coefficient which determines the sensitivity to variations of @xmath0 .",
    "this coefficient mainly depends upon the electronic configuration of the level . a recent calculation @xcite , utilizing relativistic hartree - fock and configuration interaction methods , found",
    "values of @xmath17 for two nearly degenerate opposite - parity states in atomic dysprosium that are both large and of opposite sign . for the even - parity state ( designated as a ) ,",
    "@xmath18 while , for the odd - parity state ( designated as b ) , @xmath19 .",
    "the time variation of the transition frequency between levels a and b is ( for @xmath20 ) @xmath21 in other words , @xmath22/yr , implies @xmath23/yr .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of determining the central frequency from a resonance lineshape is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of counts and @xmath26 is the transition width . in the dysprosium system , @xmath27 is determined mainly by the lifetime of state a , @xmath28s ( @xmath29s ) @xcite .",
    "a reasonable counting rate of @xmath30 , corresponds to a statistical sensitivity to @xmath31 of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the integration time in seconds .",
    "after an integration time of one day , @xmath34 , thus allowing for a statistical sensitivity of @xmath1/yr for two measurements separated by a year s time .",
    "it should be noted that the sensitivity to a variation in @xmath0 is not proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath36 is sufficiently small , the uncertainty in its determination is no longer limited by the relative uncertainty of the reference clock frequency ( @xmath37 ) , but rather by other experimental uncertainties .",
    "for example , a modest cs clock provides an absolute accuracy of @xmath38 . in the dy transitions considered here , typical frequencies are @xmath39 or smaller .",
    "thus the clock uncertainty will only become an issue when other uncertainties can be reduced to the level of @xmath40 and even then can be overcome in a straightforward way by using a better reference clock .",
    "the relatively modest requirement for the reference clock also means that the dy experiment is insensitive to a variation of the clock s frequency due to a change in fundamental constants .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 varies by @xmath41 , the fractional change in the cs clock frequency will be @xmath42 , as the hyperfine transition frequency employed in the clock is proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "this variation is negligible in comparison with the clock stability of @xmath38 .",
    "the experimental search for a variation of the e1 transition frequency between the two opposite - parity states will proceed as follows . as shown in fig .",
    "[ elevels ] , atoms are populated @xcite to the longer - lived odd - parity state b ( @xmath44s @xcite ) via three transitions .",
    "the first two transitions require light at 833 nm and 669 nm , respectively .",
    "the third transition involves spontaneous decay with a branching ratio of 30% and the emission of 1397-nm light .",
    "once in state b , atoms are transferred to state a with an rf electric field , whose frequency is referenced to a commercial cs frequency standard .",
    "a resonance lineshape is attained by scanning the rf frequency and monitoring 564-nm light from the second step of fluorescence from state a.      because the energy separation between the nearly degenerate levels is on the order of hyperfine splittings and isotope shift energies ( fig .",

    "a low - frequency transition that offers a higher counting rate is the @xmath49 transition in @xmath50dy .",

    "matrix elements connecting all levels with the same configurations as a and b have similar values  @xcite .",

    "however , for a resonance lineshape with unresolved sublevels , the central frequency remains largely unaffected .",
    "this is not true in the case of magnetic resonance ( where transitions occur between magnetically split sublevels of the same level ) and can be explained as follows : in the basis in which the quantization axis is perpendicular to the electric field , there are only @xmath145 and @xmath146 transitions .",

    "as mentioned earlier , residual circular polarization in the linearly polarized light , used in the first and second step of the population , may induce atomic orientation , but can be controlled to the level of @xmath151 , which is sufficient for the desired sensitivity to @xmath0 .",

    "the interaction region is illuminated by much hotter bbr from the atomic oven ( t@xmath160 ) which is @xmath161 away . however , the effect is smaller due to the decreased solid angle : @xmath162 ^ 4",

    "the bbr shifts are large compared to the desired level of sensitivity and are difficult to eliminate .",
    "however , these shifts can be kept constant to the desired level by stabilizing the temperature of the interaction region ( to @xmath164c ) and the oven ( to @xmath165c ) . for the oven ,",
    "possible changes in surface emissivity will be a concern and requires further investigation .      because the typical cross - sections of the atomic collisions are on the order of @xmath166@xmath167 , most atoms in the atomic beam do not experience collisions with other atoms before they encounter the back wall of the interaction region .",
    "collisional shifts of @xmath168 mhz / torr ( corresponding to the above - mentioned collisional cross - section values ) are typically found for atomic transitions when the width is measured as a function of the atomic pressure .",
    "a possible effect of the rare collisions in the beam can be estimated by extrapolating these numbers to the low pressure values corresponding to the beam environment . assuming a @xmath169mhz / torr shift due to collisions with residual gas , in order to keep time - dependent shifts below a few mhz , the residual gas pressure must be stable at a level @xmath170 torr .",
    "this can be achieved with standard ultra - high - vacuum equipment .",
    "the pressure stability and composition of the residual gas will be monitored with a residual gas analyzer .",
    "note that we may find that collisional shifts are , in fact , much smaller than the above estimate because the a - b transition is nominally between f and d inner - shell electrons  @xcite .",
    "another important effect that may reduce the effect of collisions on the measurement of the variation of @xmath0 is that it is likely that an atom experiencing a collision will be quenched to a different atomic state , and , thus , will not produce a 564-nm fluorescent photon , and will therefore avoid detection .    a similar consideration applies to collisions between dy atoms themselves . in the absence of collisional quenching ,",
    "the worst - case estimate is that the present dy density ( @xmath5 atoms/@xmath171 ) could give a shift of up to @xmath172 .",
    "this effect will be investigated by measuring transition frequencies as a function of the atomic beam intensity and , if needed , the dy beam intensity can be monitored and stabilized during measurement . measuring a transition frequency at several different dy - beam intensities",
    "will allow extrapolation to the collision - free value of the frequency . technically , it is possible to vary the density of atomic in the atomic beam without significantly affecting other conditions of the experiment .",
    "for example , black - body radiation intensity in the interaction region can be maintained constant by separately controlling the front and back temperatures of the dy oven .",
    "the bbr intensity is determined by the temperature of the front part of the oven near the nozzle , while the flux of atoms is determined by the lower temperature towards the back of the oven .",
    "another concern is a possible collisional wall - shift resulting from a fraction of the atoms reentering the interaction region upon reflection from its back wall .",
    "this effect is suppressed by a number of small factors : reflection probability , solid angle for entering the interaction region , the probability for an atom to avoid quenching in the wall collision , etc . if necessary , cryo - cooling of the interaction - region walls may be employed to reduce the probability for an atom to bounce from it .",
    "the effect of the first - order doppler shift is estimated to be small . to see this , we model the electric field ( fig .",
    "[ intregion ] ) as a standing wave constructed from two traveling waves counter - propagating co - linearly with the direction of the atomic beam . due to ohmic losses inside the conductors , the amplitude of each wave",
    "gets attenuated . a difference in the intensity of these waves at the location of the atoms leads to asymmetric doppler broadening of the lineshape , and thus an apparent shift .",
    "we estimate this intensity difference by first considering the b - field induced by the time - varying e - field .",
    "this b - field penetrates inside the metal to within a skin - depth , inducing currents from which the power loss can be readily calculated  @xcite .",
    "this simple model gives a fractional power difference @xmath173 .",
    "since the doppler shift for a given traveling - wave power is @xmath174 , the shift is @xmath175 . for a transition frequency of @xmath78",
    ", we estimate the asymmetry to be @xmath176 and the corresponding shift is @xmath177 .",
    "one can imagine a factor of @xmath178 suppression if rf power is fed to the plates in a symmetric fashion .",
    "thus , it is only required that this shift be stable to @xmath179 in order to achieve a sensitivity of a few @xmath180 .",
    "in addition to the first - order doppler shift , we also consider the second - order effect . depending upon the rf transition ,",
    "the second order doppler shift is @xmath181 , which is sufficiently small .",
    "a powerful method to detect and eliminate possible sources of systematic shifts common to both levels is to simultaneously measure the transition frequency between hyperfine levels of a given parity state .",
    "the reason is that , because the levels involved have the same relativistic corrections , this frequency is insensitive to variations of @xmath0 .",
    "one possible scheme is to excite an m1 transition , e.  g. , as shown in fig .",
    "[ e1m1 ] , whose frequency can be monitored by looking for disappearance in the fluorescence from level @xmath153 for a fixed e1 transition frequency .",
    "alternatively , we can utilize another e1 transition as shown in fig .",
    "[ e1e1 ] . in this scenario ,",
    "the effect @xmath0 variation is twice as large in the sum of the two frequencies , while the difference is insensitive to @xmath0 variations .",
    "furthermore , one can compare e1 transitions for the two abundant isotopes with zero nuclear spin ( @xmath50dy and @xmath182dy ) .",
    "the counting rate is significantly higher and the level structure is much simpler without hyperfine interactions .",
