    "the inflationary paradigm @xcite can successfully account for the observed temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and the distribution of large scale structures @xcite .",
    "the basic outcome of simplest single - field slow - roll inflation models is the statistical isotropy , the gaussian and ( almost ) scale - invariant power spectrum @xcite .",
    "these statistical properties can be tested by precise measurements of the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "the observational data provided by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite showed the evidence of the scale dependence of the power spectrum , whose property has been used to discriminate between a host of inflationary models .",
    "interestingly , the wmap data also indicated the deviation from the gaussian perturbations and they gave us a hint of the statistical anisotropy @xcite . according to the recent results of planck , the gaussian perturbations are still consistent with the data , but the statistical anisotropy remains @xcite . in the light of these new results , it is worth investigating a possible statistical anisotropy based on concrete theoretical models .",
    "naively , the statistical anisotropy implies that vector fields can play an important role during inflation .",
    "a mechanism for creating the statistical anomaly at the end of inflation was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended in various ways  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a more concrete model has been proposed in the context of supergravity @xcite . there",
    ", the anisotropic inflation is realized as an attractor and the vector hair survives during inflation .",
    "the latter vector hair gives rise to rich phenomenology  @xcite such as the statistical anisotropy and the cross correlation between the curvature perturbations and the primordial gravitational waves ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "in particular , the latter would imply the correlation between the temperature fluctuation and the b - mode polarization @xcite .",
    "remarkably , subsequent works revealed that vector fields can also induce the large non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the non - gaussianity of curvature perturbations has been investigated in the context of anisotropic inflation  @xcite-@xcite , which further emphasized the rich phenomenology of the anisotropic inflationary models  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the planck constrained the anisotropic inflationary models with vector fields strongly . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it was pointed out that not only vector fields but also two - form fields can potentially give rise to anisotropic inflation . in fact",
    ", it is well known that there are two - form fields in string theory @xcite .",
    "hence it is natural to explore this possibility from the theoretical point of view .",
    "one may suspect that there is no statistical anisotropy because the two - form field can be represented by a pseudo scalar field , i.e. , axion .",
    "however , there remains a possibility that a non - trivial polarization of a two - form field induces the statistical anisotropy . in this case",
    "the anisotropy comes from an expectation value of the spatial derivative of the axion field . at first glance",
    "this seems to be odd , but it is a natural framework from the picture of two - form fields .",
    "hence , in this paper , we study this possibility in detail .",
    "we show that several interesting features are present in our model .",

    "@xcite , anisotropic inflation can be sustained by the background two - form field . moreover , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists a prolate type anisotropy in the power spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
    "in contrast to vector models the non - gaussianity vanishes in the squeezed limit , but the nonlinear estimator @xmath0 of the equilateral and enfolded shapes can be as large as the order of 10 . hence , our predictions are consistent with the planck data and the future analysis may reveal these statistical anisotropies .",
