    "it is well known that gravity assist is an excellent technique to speed up or slow down a spacecraft , but is also a mechanism to deviate its course . for these reasons , nasa and esa use the gravity assist as a helpful tool to reduce mission cost and to save fuel and travel time .",
    "otherwise , planet exploration would be hard to pursue using current technologies .",
    "this phenomenon , also called slingshot effect or swing - by maneuver , can be easily understood as an elastic collision of two particles .",
    "@xcite however , there is a paradox in the elastic derivation , because if one assumes that the planet s mass is much greater than the spacecraft s , one would conclude that the initial and final speeds of the spacecraft ( both when it is very far from the planet ) should be equal , like in the usual kepler motion . the  mistake \" with this thinking is that one is forgetting the reference frame , since the above conclusion is correct for an observer on the planet , but not for an observer on the sun due to the relative motion between the planet and the sun .",
    "therefore , one needs to make a galilean addition of velocities for the latter case that results in the swing - by maneuver .",
    "one can check that the elastic collision is satisfied , the energy gained by the spacecraft is equal to the energy lost by the planet , but this is so small that the planet s motion is not altered . @xcite the reader can also look for other approaches to explain the slingshot effect , like derivations from special relativity , @xcite classical lagrangian @xcite and work - impulse .",
    "@xcite our goal in this paper is to get some insights of how the gravity assist changes the course of a spacecraft away from the ecliptic plane like in ulysses mission .",
    "our motivation is that we can find no literature about 3d gravity assist at the introductory physics level .",
    "let us start with the description of our assumptions .",
    "we will use the word _",
    "planet _ for the celestial body that alters the spacecraft s trajectory .    1 .   for simplicity ,",
    "the sun , the earth and the planet are all in the same plane , the _ ecliptic plane .",
    "_ we also consider that the sun s and the planet s equators lie in that plane .",

    "the spacecraft motion can be divided in four parts , according to which celestial object contributes more to the gravitational force : 1 .",
    "escaping the earth , 2 .",
    "moving by sun interaction , 3 .   ",
    "swinging by \" the planet and 4 .   orbiting around the sun or escaping the solar system .",
    "+ we concentrate our work on the last two parts , where the gravity assist effect is employed and causes the final trajectory . [ motions ] 3 .   after escaping the earth ,",
    "the spacecraft moves in a plane that is parallel to ecliptic .",
    "the interaction between the planet and the spacecraft is considered as scattering phenomenon in the planet s frame , occurring in a very short time compared to the period of the planet s circular orbit .",
    "therefore , the planet s motion is taken as a straight line during the slingshot effect .",
    "[ scatter ]",
    "our goal in this section is to determine the scattering angle of the spacecraft , @xmath0 , due to the gravitational interaction with the planet , in the planet s frame . a hyperbolic trajectory is shown in fig .  [ fig : hyper ] . in polar coordinates ,",
    "the equation for this kind of conic section is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the eccentricity and @xmath3 is the semi - major axis .    as seen from this equation , a particular hyperbola",
    "is completely defined by two parameters : @xmath4 and @xmath3 . in celestial mechanics ,",
    "these parameters are usually written as functions of the first integrals of the motion : the energy , @xmath5 , and the angular momentum , @xmath6 , of a particle moving under the influence of a central inverse - square law force . in scattering problems ,",
    "the impact parameter is used in place of the angular momentum .",
    "we consider that the initial velocity @xmath7 and the pericenter @xmath8 are our known values , so that they will take the place of the above parameters , describing the spacecraft s hyperbolic orbit .    by solving for the eccentricity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cse ] ) when @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we find @xmath11 where the semi - major axis is obtained by the usual celestial - mechanics equation @xmath12 since @xmath13 , when the spacecraft is far away from central force source .    by taking @xmath14 in the conic section equation ( [ eq : cse ] ) and solving for @xmath15",

    "[ fig : hyper ] , the spacecraft s scattering angle is @xmath18 which has values @xmath19 ( attractive scattering ) .",
    "let us first study the case when the spacecrafts - hyperbolic - orbit plane ( shop ) is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compvp ] ) . note that under assumption [ scatter ] , shop is a fixed plane in the planet s frame , but it is a constant - velocity moving plane in the sun s frame . for this particular case ,",
    "the 3d vector analysis gets simplified and allows us to picture how the general case can be established .",
    "we also choose that the spacecraft flies over the planet s south pole .",
    "our goal here is to determine the angle between the spacecrafts - final - orbit plane ( sfop ) and the ecliptic plane , we will call it the _ elevation angle _ , @xmath20 .    in a planet s frame as that shown in fig .",

    "the initial kinematic variables for the spacecraft orbiting around the sun [ part ( d ) ] are those at the end of the slingshot [ part ( c ) ] .",
    "thus , the initial velocity in part ( d ) is equal to @xmath26 and the initial vector position @xmath45 is taken to have a magnitude equal to the planet s distance from the sun and lying in the ecliptic plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfop ] ) .",
    "this approximation can be justified because the gravitational force due to the planet is much weaker than that due to the sun ( see a numerical calculation for jupiter at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] ) .",
    "from the angular momentum conservation and the properties of the cross product , the sfop is completely defined by @xmath26 and @xmath45 .",

    "when the spacecraft encounters the planet and reaches the latitude @xmath70 s as maximum ( no further south ) , its final orbit around the sun will be exactly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane .",

    "let us check the agreement between our results and the actual ulysses s orbit data .",
    "the ulysses s elevation angle is around @xmath71 , then from table [ tab : elevation ] , @xmath72 km / s , which implies that its semi - major axis is about 3.10 au ( we have used eq .",

    "@xcite this comparison shows that our 3d slingshot formulation is numerically acceptable in spite of our assumptions and approximations .",
