    "electromagnetic radiations are an excellent probe for extracting thermodynamical information of a matter produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions , as they are emitted from all the stages of collisions with wide @xmath0 , and do nt interact strongly with medium once produced  @xcite .",
    "they appear in two figures , namely , photons ( @xmath1 ) that have zero - mass and virtual photons ( @xmath2 ) that have finite mass .",
    "experimentalists often refer virtual photons as dileptons since they have been measuring virtual photons through lepton - pair channels ( @xmath3 ) , by which a wide kinematic range in invariant mass and transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) can be explored .",
    "photons are produced through a compton scattering of quarks and gluons ( @xmath5 ) or an annihilation of quarks and anti - quarks ( @xmath6 ) as leading - order ( lo ) processes , and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) process is dominated by bremsstrahlung and fragmentation ( @xmath7 ) , as depicted in figure  [ figbasic ] .",
    "their yields are proportional to @xmath8 , which are @xmath940 times lower than those of hadrons that are produced in strong interactions .",
    "virtual photons are produced by annihilation of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the initial hard scattering process that takes place in the beginning of the collisions produces relatively high @xmath4 photons , often referred as hard photons .",
    "they have same lo and nlo processes , and are called prompt photons and fragment photons , respectively .",
    "the production rate of these photons are well described by a nlo pqcd calculation  @xcite .",
    "photons will be emitted from the hot and dense medium ( quark - gluon plasma : qgp ) in high energy nucleus collisions and manifest at moderate @xmath4(1@xmath103gev/@xmath11 ) if the qgp is formed  @xcite .",
    "we often call these photons as thermal photons .",
    "the thermal photons are of interest in exploring thermodynamical nature of the qgp , such as temperature .",
    "one can also obtain the degree of freedom of the system by combining the temperature with measurement of the energy density of the system as @xmath12 . for @xmath131gev , the photons",
    "are predominantly contributed from hadron gas state via the processes of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and etc .",

    "however these photons are overwhelmed by the large background coming from the decay of hadrons .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the major contributors to the background photons ( @xmath995% ) .",
    "the signal to background ratio at 1 - 3gev/@xmath11 is of the order @xmath910% .",
    "one can understand the difficulty of the measurement by comparing the uncertainty of the best @xmath19 measurement at rhic  @xcite which directly relates to the precision of background determination .",
    "there is a certain probability that photons produced by the same process acquire virtual mass and decay into lepton - pairs ( shown as one another degree of freedom in figure  [ figbasic](b ) ) .",
    "this process is called internal conversion process and is different from the virtual photon production described above .",
    "we will explain these photons in detail in a later section .",
    "there have been several attempts on measuring thermal photons in high energy nuclear collisions as an evidence of qgp formation .",
    "the first sizable signal was reported by the wa98 experiments at sps in 1@xmath103gev/@xmath11 where a calculation predicts that qgp photons manifest  @xcite . at that time",
    ", the hard photons were not measured because the statistics ran out at the @xmath4 where the hard photons start arising .",
    "estimating the hard photon contribution had to rely on a theoretical guidance that had large ambiguity , therefore the measurement was not able to exhibit the thermal photon contribution  @xcite .",
    "the source of dileptons depend on their mass and @xmath4 of the measurement .",
    "the low mass region ( @xmath201gev/@xmath21 ) at low @xmath4 is predominantly from the in - medium decay of @xmath22 mesons and/or thermal radiation as shown in figure  [ figsourcedilepton](a )  @xcite .",
    "the same mass region at higher @xmath4 or higher mass region at lower @xmath4 are from mainly from the thermal radiation .",
    "the dileptons of interest are obtained after subtracting large combinatoric background arising from dalitz decays of @xmath19 or @xmath23 ( e.g. , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the outline of the background components and resonances in dilepton mass spectra is shown in figure  [ figsourcedilepton](b )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we review the recent measurements of photons and dileptons from rhic and lhc experiments and discuss what we have learned from the data .",

    "the fragment photons may be reduced in central au+au collisions due to the parton energy loss .",
    "the data is compared with several model predictions .",
    "it is interesting to note that a model that includes reduction of fragment photon due to energy loss of hard scattered partons and increase of jet - photon conversion photons ( coherent + conversion + @xmath28 ) is not consistent with the data .",
    "the small suppression in @xmath26 seen in the highest @xmath4 is likely due to the fact that the ratio of the yields in au+au to @xmath27 was computed without taking the isospin dependence of direct photon production into account  @xcite .",

    "considering the fact that neither prompt photons from lhc nor prompt+fragment photons from rhic are suppressed , the contribution of photons from fragmentation and jet - photon conversion could be smaller than predicted .",
    "several measurements benefited from the fact that these hard electromagnetic radiations are well under control .",
    "for instance , direct photons are utilized to quantify jet energy loss as they carry the initial momenta of jets  @xcite .",
    "a new hard probe that became available at the lhc energy is @xmath29-bosons .",
    "the @xmath29-bosons have a peak mass of @xmath980gev/@xmath21 , and are produced in the medium with a lifetime of 0.1fm/@xmath11 .",
    "therefore , they carry information on the initial states of the collisions , and decay before they are affected by the medium . the @xmath29-boson yields scaled by nuclear thickness function ( @xmath30 ) as a function of @xmath31 ( centrality ) published by the cms experiments are shown in figure  [ figlhcphotonandz](b )  @xcite .",

    "we point out that @xmath29-bosons can serve as one of the most reliable tools to normalize the dilepton spectra between @xmath27 and a+a collisions .",
    "in the conventional real photon measurement , single photons can be observed after a huge amount of background photons coming from hadron decays ( @xmath19 , @xmath23 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , etc . )",
    "are subtracted off from the inclusive photon distributions .",
    "this fact makes it very difficult to look at the signal at low @xmath4 , where thermal photons from qgp manifest .",
    "a breakthrough was made by utilizing internal conversion of photons  @xcite .",
    "because these photons decay into @xmath34 , one can use measurement technique for dileptons .",
    "the relation between real photon production and the @xmath34 pairs decaying from associated internal conversion photon production can be described as follow  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fine structure constant , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the masses of the electron and the @xmath34 pair respectively , and @xmath39 is a process dependent factor that goes to 1 when @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "this equation also applies to the relation between the photons from hadron decays ( e.g. @xmath42 ) and the @xmath34 pairs from dalitz decays ( @xmath43 ) . for @xmath19 and @xmath23 ,",

    "much progress has been made in understanding high @xmath4 direct photons as well as @xmath29-bosons with the latest rhic and lhc results .",
    "the soft single photons have been studied down to lower @xmath4 using internal conversion and external conversion technique at rhic and lhc , and exhibit the average temperature of the system .",
    "a large flow of soft photons was also observed both at rhic and lhc , which are not explained by models considering qgp only so far .",
    "the low mass dilepton excess was observed at the phenix and star experiments at rhic in au+au collisions , but are not quantitatively agreeing each other .",
    "the flow of dilepton is as important as the one of photons , and experiments should make an effort to improve the measurement .",
    "the star results on dileptons at several cms energies shows that the excess in lmr is consistent with in - medium modification of the @xmath22 meson spectral function .",
    "if it is the case , the flow of this mass region may exhibit the @xmath80 scaling with assuming they are all @xmath22 .",
    "this is an interesting topic to explore .",
