    "when investigating quantum relaxation processes in the condensed phase , one often partitions the full quantum system into a subsystem whose dynamics is of interest and an environment or bath with which the subsystem interacts .",
    "there is a large literature dealing with such open quantum systems .",
    "@xcite a number of different equations of motion for the density matrix of the subsystem have been derived , including the lindblad  @xcite and redfield  @xcite equations and a variety of generalized quantum master equations .",
    "@xcite effects due to the environment typically enter these equations through coupling terms involving parameters that characterize the bath relaxation processes .",
    "such equations have been used to investigate aspects of decoherence in the quantum subsystem arising from interactions with bath degrees of freedom .",
    "sometimes it is convenient to suppose that the dynamics of certain degrees of freedom is described by quantum mechanics while other degrees of freedom may be treated by classical mechanics to a good approximation .",
    "this is the case if one considers systems involving light particles interacting with a bath of heavy particles .",
    "proton and electron transfer processes in the condensed phase and in biomolecules fall into this category , as do many vibrational relaxation processes .",
    "one is then led to study the dynamics of quantum - classical systems where the entire system is partitioned into quantum and classical subsystems .",
    "@xcite equations of motion for the quantum subsystem density matrix , where the classical bath is modeled as a dissipative environment have been derived .",
    "such descriptions are useful for many applications ; however , there are situations where the quantum subsystem evolution depends explicitly on the details of the bath dynamics .",
    "this is important since specific features of bath motions can influence quantum rate processes .",
    "@xcite to describe such specific bath dynamical effects one must use the full quantum - classical equation of motion .",
    "another partition of the system is required when the quantum subsystem is directly coupled to a small subset of the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , in proton transfer within a bio - molecule , the quantum subsystem may be taken to be the proton , which interacts directly with a specific set of functional groups of a larger molecule immersed in a solvent . in this case",
    ", we may define a quantum - classical subsystem comprising both quantum degrees of freedom ( the proton ) and a subset of the classical variables that directly couple to these quantum degrees of freedom ( the specified functional groups ) .",
    "the remaining classical variables constitute the bath .",
    "in such a partition , the bath may be treated either explicitly or as a dissipative environment .",
    "equations of motion for the density matrix of a quantum - classical subsystem interacting with a dissipative bath have been derived .",
    "@xcite in this article we consider quantum - classical systems of this type but instead retain the details of the bath dynamics and study the conditions under which the dynamics can be reduced to a master equation .",
    "the reduction of quantum - classical dynamics to a subsystem master equation hinges on the decoherence in the subsystem induced by interactions with the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite consequently , we focus on how decoherence is described in quantum - classical systems and the conditions under which it is strong enough to eliminate the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix on short time scales .",
    "the result of the analysis is a non - markovian generalized master equation for the density matrix of the quantum - classical subsystem .",
    "when this equation is used to compute non - equilibrium averages or correlation function expressions involving subsystem properties , we show that the subsystem dynamics may be lifted to the full phase space , including the bath degrees of freedom , to recover a markovian master equation for the quantum and all classical degrees of freedom .",
    "solutions of this equation may be obtained from an ensemble of surface - hopping trajectories , each member of which incorporates the effects of quantum decoherence .",

    "next , we analyze the form of the memory kernel operator  ( [ mem kern ] ) in order to cast it into a form that is suitable for the derivation of a master equation .",

    "it is worth noting here that the momentum shift operators do not act on the full classical environment .",

    "this evolution is interspersed with quantum transitions taking the subsystem to other coherently coupled states where evolution is again on mean surfaces with associated phase factors . in the course of this evolution",

    "this result is also applicable to multi - level systems in a weak coupling limit where quantum transitions among different coherently coupled states are neglected in the the off - diagonal propagator .",

    "the results of the calculation of the forward time dependent rate coefficient , @xmath150 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "the figure compares the rate coefficients using adiabatic , master equation , and quantum - classical liouville dynamics .",
    "as expected the plots show rapid decay on a time scale @xmath151 to a plateau region characterized by a much slower decay on the macroscopic chemical relaxation time scale , @xmath152 for weak coupling and @xmath153 for strong coupling .     in fig .",
    "[ result ] , we see that the short - time decay portion of the rate coefficient given by the master equation simulation is in agreement with the quantum - classical result .",
    "the time scale of this decay , @xmath154 in the weak coupling case and @xmath155 for strong coupling , is about one order of magnitude larger than the average decoherence time @xmath156 for weak coupling , and @xmath157 for strong coupling as discussed above . from the figures we conclude that indeed @xmath158 .",
    "this inequality provides the conditions for the applicability of the markovian approximation used to derive the master equation .",
    "the plateau regions for both quantum - classical liouvile and master equation dynamics have lower values than those for adiabatic dynamics .",
    "the smaller rate constant for nonadiabatic dynamics is due to enhanced barrier recrossing as a result of motion on either the excited state or mean surfaces .",
    "the plateau value using master equation dynamics in the strong coupling case is slightly higher than that obtained using quantum - classical liouville dynamics .",
    "this likely arises from the fact that in quantum - classical liouville dynamics the system evolves on the mean surface for long times , allowing trajectories to re - enter the region of high nonadiabatic coupling where quantum transitions take place .",
    "thus , the rate coefficient is reduced due to recrossings in the barrier region . in general , for both weak and strong coupling , the master equation provides quite a good description of the rate coefficient data .",
    "the master equation calculations presented above bear many similarities to surface - hopping schemes that have been used previously to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics of quantum - classical systems  .",
    "it is useful to comment on some of the similarities and highlight the differences . in most surface - hopping schemes , and in our master equation dynamics , the classical degrees of freedom evolve on single adiabatic potential energy surface segments according to newton s equations of motion governed by hellmann - feynman forces .",
    "this dynamics should be contrasted with the trajectory evolution in quantum - classical liouville dynamics , where the trajectory segments of the classical degrees of freedom evolve on single adiabatic surfaces as well as mean surfaces .",
    "the differences between our master equation dynamics and other surface - hopping methods lie in the prescription for quantum transitions and the manner in which decoherence is incorporated into the theory .",
    "for example , in the fewest - switches surface hopping scheme ,  @xcite the probability of a transition depends on the nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements and the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix . in our master equation",
    "the probabilities of quantum transitions are determined by a monte carlo sampling based on the magnitudes of our phase space dependent transition rates , @xmath89 , and the sampling algorithm reweights averages so that no bias is introduced .",
    "decoherence is accounted for in the fewest - switches simulation by collapsing the density matrix onto a diagonal state depending on certain conditions such as motion outside a window of strong coupling .",
    "@xcite in our calculation decoherence effects have been incorporated into the calculation of the transition rates .",
    "decoherence has also been incorporated into the formulations of surface - hopping methods using other physical principles .",
    "the idea in such methods is to include the effects of decoherence in single trajectories , much like the description our master equation provides .",
    "for example , in the methods developed by rossky et .",
    "decoherence is introduced through an additional term in the evolution equation that accounts for the quantum dispersion about each classical phase space coordinate in the bath . in this way",
    "each of the trajectories in the full phase space experiences decoherence .",
    "the quantum dispersion of the bath is not included in the model calculations presented above but it is easily accounted for in our theory . in our master equation decoherence arises through averaging over the bath phase space variables which were taken to be classically distributed for high temperatures .",
    "the rate coefficient formalism in eq .",
    "( [ rate_bath_average ] ) involves sampling from the full quantum spectral density function thus incorporating quantum dispersion in the bath coordinates .",
    "such quantum effects have already been investigated in the context of quantum - classical liouville dynamics  @xcite and for the temperatures used in our calculations , these effects are very small . regardless of whether the bath is treated classically or quantum mechanically , decoherence enters our master equation through the forms of the transition rates and not as an additional term in the equation of motion .",
    "finally , we remark that the simulation scheme for master equation dynamics has a number of attractive features when compared to quantum - classical liouville dynamics .",
    "the solution of the master equation consists of two numerically simple parts .",
    "the first is the computation of the memory function which involves adiabatic evolution along mean surfaces .",
    "once the transition rates are known as a function of the subsystem coordinates , the sequential short - time propagation algorithm may be used to evolve the observable or density .",
    "since the dynamics is restricted to single adiabatic surfaces , no phase factors enter the calculation increasing the stability of the algorithm . for complex reaction coordinates which are arbitrary functions of the bath",
    "coordinates the calculation of the transition rates will be more difficult and time consuming . future research will determine if the master equation can be applied easily to realistic general many - body systems .",
    "nevertheless , the results reported in this paper have served to provide a basis for an understanding of the domain of validity of master equation approaches to quantum - classical nonadiabatic dynamics based on decoherence .",

    "this propagator is given exactly by @xmath164 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "here we used the fact that  @xcite @xmath167 to express the operator as a product of a phase factor and a classical propagator .",
    "we note that the only off - diagonal propagator matrix elements that contribute to the dynamics here are @xmath168 .",
    "recall from the definition of the momentum shift operator , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltap ] ) , that transitions can only occur if there is sufficient momentum in the subsystem to make a transition to or from a mean surface . otherwise the transitions are not allowed . using the above form of the off - diagonal propagator in eq .",
