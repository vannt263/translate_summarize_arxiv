    "studies on the breakdown of symmetries and their restorations have been very useful in the analysis of phenomena related to phase transitions .",
    "such studies applied to quantum chromodynamics are particularly fascinating since qcd owns a very complicated phase structure . among them , the restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature ( @xmath4 ) and/or quark chemical density ( @xmath10 ) has been one of the most interesting and stimulating subjects for decades .",
    "recently it has been reported that very strong magnetic field in the order of the several times of @xmath11 $ ] can be produced in the noncentral ( peripheral ) heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiment by star collaboration at rhic  @xcite . according to this strong magnetic field and @xmath12-violating domains created inside the qgp , signals for possible @xmath13 and @xmath12 violations",
    "were observed as the charge separation along the direction of the external magnetic field , which is perpendicular to the collision plane . the charge separation at relatively low @xmath4 has been already investigated within the instanton - vacuum framework by one of the authors ( s.i.n .",
    ")  @xcite , in which related works and references can be found . actually even before this sort of studies receiving much interest , qcd under magnetic field had been an important subject because of magnetar .",
    "there have been many approaches to study this issue . here",
    "we will present our results based on the instanton - vacuum model @xcite .",
    "we employ the instanton - liquid model at finite @xmath4 , the four - dimensional integral in the effective action is replaced by the three - dimensional integral with the summation over the fermionic matsubara frequency .",
    "the harrington - shepard caloron solution  @xciteis used to modify the instanton parameters , i.e. the average instanton size @xmath2 and inter - instanton distance @xmath3 , as functions of @xmath4 .",
    "the result is shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "although this approach does not manifest the quark confinement , such as the nontrivial holonomy caloron , i.e. the kraan - van baal - lee - lu caloron  @xcite , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is a useful nonperturbatve method to study qcd matter at finite @xmath4 . to include the external magnetic field ,",
    "we make use of the linear schwinger method  @xcite . besides we also take into account the meson - loop corrections ( mlc ) for the su(2 ) light - flavor sector as the large-@xmath14 corrections because it is essential to reproduce the correct current - quark mass dependence of relevant physical quantities  @xcite and universal - class chiral restoration pattern at finite @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the detail of our model we refer readers to our papers @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath15 as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17,width=151 ]",
    "our results of the constituent quark masses are shown in fig.(2 ) and fig.(3 ) for @xmath4=0 and @xmath4=50 nev .",
    "the chiral condensates are shown in fig.(4 ) for the chiral limit and physical quakr mass cases , respectively .",
    "the critical @xmath4 for the chiral restoration , @xmath18 tends to be shifted higher pronouncedly in the presence of the @xmath19 in the chiral limit as shown in table.(1 ) .",
    "the strength of the isospin breaking between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 quark condensates is also explored in detail by defining the ratio @xmath22 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath19 .",
    "they are shown in fig.(5 ) . finally , we compute the pion weak - decay constant @xmath8 and pion mass @xmath9 below @xmath18 as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath19 shown in fig.(6 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we summarize our results as follows ,    * the external magnetic field enhances the sb@xmath6s in terms of the magnetic catalysis @xcite , which is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the @xmath20-quark constituent mass is more sensitive to the magnetic field . * on top of the explicit isospin symmetry",
    "breaking , there appears a point at which the constituent quark masses for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks coincide each other for the strong magnetic field @xmath24 g. * the effects from the magnetic catalysis becomes more pronounced in the higher @xmath4 region because as @xmath4 increases the sb@xmath6s effects generated from the instanton is weakened .",
    "thus the magnetic catalysis effects becomes more important there .",
    "* for the physical quark mass case , the ratio @xmath25 shows nontrivial structures with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath26 due to the complicated competition between the magnetic catalysis and the explicitly isospin breaking effect . * according to our simple and qualitative analysis using the gor relation , we observe correct partial chiral - restoration and magnetic - catalysis behaviors for the pion - weak decay constant @xmath8 and pion mass @xmath9 .",
    "they decreases and increases about @xmath27 at @xmath28 mev in comparison to those at @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "however , the changes due to the magnetic field are relatively small , just a few percent .",
    "our next step is to include the finite @xmath10 to the effective action in the instanton framework .",
    "the result will be reported later .",
