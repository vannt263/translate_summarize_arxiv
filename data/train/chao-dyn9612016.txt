    "in particular , billiards in a magnetic field appear to be relevant for the study of transport properties in mesoscopic systems , diamagnetism and the quantum hall effect ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in this work , we consider the classical motion of a charged particle in a plane domain , with a perpendicular magnetic field of intensity @xmath0 and a potential @xmath1 . we first discuss a method for proving existence of periodic and quasiperiodic orbits .",
    "then we give some results on kam tori and adiabatic invariants for billiards in a magnetic field .",
    "finally , we consider the scattering on a hard disc in crossed electromagnetic fields , where we prove the existence of bound states .",
    "details on the present results can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider the classical motion of a particle in a connected domain @xmath2 ( which may be unbounded or not simply connected ) .",
    "the boundary @xmath3 is parametrized by its arclength , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ; the unit tangent vector and the curvature are given respectively by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "inside @xmath2 , the billiard flow is defined by the lagrangian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vector potential in symmetric gauge ( we will adopt the sign convention @xmath10 ) .    the dynamics is defined in the following way .",
    "assume that the billiard particle starts on the boundary at @xmath11 , with a velocity @xmath12 making an angle @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "it then evolves in @xmath2 according to the lagrange equations .",
    "if the particle returns to the boundary , at a point @xmath15 , with a velocity @xmath16 making an angle @xmath17 with @xmath18 , it is reflected elastically , meaning that it leaves the boundary again with an angle @xmath19 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath20th collision may thus be parametrized by the coordinates @xmath21 , or , alternatively , by the _ birkhoff variables _ @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the tangent velocity .    as long as the particle returns to the boundary",
    ", we may thus describe the dynamics by the _ bouncing map _ @xmath24 .    a very useful tool to study the bouncing map is its _ generating function _",
    "@xcite , which satisfies @xmath26 it can be constructed in the following way : let @xmath27 be a trajectory connecting the points @xmath11 and @xmath15 , and @xmath28 the action along @xmath27 , where @xmath29 is the momentum . we know from analytical mechanics that for infinitesimal variations of the end points @xmath30 , the change of action is @xmath31 .",
    "it is then easy to check that @xmath32 satisfies the relations ( [ defg ] ) .",
    "here we have assumed that there is a unique trajectory connecting the two points on the boundary .",
    "in fact , there may be several or no solution of the lagrange equations for given end points , so that the generating function may be multiply defined on some domain , and not exist on another one .",
    "this gives rise to new complications , but the main arguments presented in the following can be transposed to this more difficult situation .    the relation ( [ defg ] ) is useful to compute periodic orbits . if @xmath33 is a sequence of arclengths on the boundary , we define the _ @xmath34point generating function _ @xmath35",
    "the law of specular reflection implies that there is a periodic orbit of period @xmath34 , hitting the boundary at @xmath36 , if and only if @xmath37 for each @xmath20 ( assuming @xmath38 is defined and sufficiently differentiable ) ; in other words , periodic orbits correspond to stationary points of @xmath38 .    the linear stability of the orbit is determined by noting that @xmath39 implies @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the jacobian matrix of the bouncing map .",
    "since @xmath42 has unit determinant , @xmath43 is area  preserving . for @xmath34 iterations , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath46 are @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the orbit is hyperbolic if @xmath49 , elliptic if @xmath50 ( under certain conditions , @xmath51 may be related to second derivatives of @xmath38 @xcite ) .",
    "the center manifold theorem implies that hyperbolic orbits are unstable , even when nonlinear terms are taken into account .",
    "elliptic orbits are generically nonlinearly stable ( in the sense of lyapunov ) , as a consequence of the kam theorem .",
    "a standard result is    [ th1 ] let @xmath43 be measure  preserving and @xmath52 in a neighborhood of the periodic orbit .",
    "assume that the eigenvalues are such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "there exists @xmath55 , depending only on the second and third derivatives of @xmath43 along the orbit ( and which can be explicitly computed ) , such that if the non  degeneracy condition @xmath56 is satisfied , any point of the orbit has a neighborhood which is invariant under the map @xmath57 .",
    "this result is proved by applying moser s theorem @xcite to the birkhoff normal form of @xmath57 .",
    "the particular case when there is only the magnetic field ( @xmath58 ) was first considered by robnik and berry @xcite . for a given energy @xmath59 ,",
    "the trajectories are arcs of larmor radius @xmath60 .",
    "the generating function and the jacobian matrix can be explicitly expressed in terms of geometric properties of the boundary @xcite .",
    "we first consider the billiard in a convex domain , i.e. , we assume that the radius of curvature @xmath61 is smooth and bounded by positive constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 . an important class of orbits are the `` whispering gallery modes '' : they correspond physically to quasiperiodic trajectories skipping along the boundary ; in phase space , these solutions live on invariant curves which are close to @xmath64 . in the zero field case ,",
    "existence of such orbits was proved by lazutkin @xcite . as remarked in @xcite , when a magnetic field is added , the dynamics near the boundary depend on the relative value of @xmath65 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this is confirmed by the following result :    [ th2 ] assume the boundary is @xmath52 and satisfies @xmath66 .",
    "there exists a cantor set of invariant curves with positive measure in the three following situations :    for @xmath67 , near @xmath68 .",
    "it corresponds to backward skipping trajectories , which are curved towards the boundary .    for @xmath69 , near @xmath70 .",
    "it corresponds to forward skipping trajectories which are curved away from the boundary .    for @xmath71 , near @xmath70 .",
    "it corresponds to backward skipping trajectories starting with a forward glancing velocity , and performing almost complete larmor circles .",
    "the proof relies on a perturbative expression of the bouncing map for small @xmath72 , which can by analyzed by moser s theorem @xcite .",
    "the difference between the regimes @xmath73 and @xmath74 is due to the symmetry breaking effect of the magnetic field .",
    "when @xmath75 , invariant curves near @xmath70 are absent due to discontinuities by tangency .",
    "note that in contrast with a theorem by mather @xcite , in a magnetic field invariant curves still exist when the curvature is allowed to vanish . in this respect ,",
    "the magnetic field has a stabilyzing effect .",
    "this result can be extended to more general billiard domains .",
    "consider for instance the billiard _ outside _ a given convex curve .",
    "one can try to construct a trajectory of the outside billiard by completing every arc of an inside trajectory to a full circle ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "there is a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between inside and outside orbits if the following property is satisfied :    a closed plane @xmath76 curve is said to have the _",
    "@xmath65intersection property _ for some @xmath77 if any circle of radius @xmath65 intersects it at most twice .",
    "a closed plane convex curve with extremal radii of curvature @xmath62 and @xmath63 satisfies the @xmath65intersection property if @xmath71 or @xmath69 .",
    "we conlude that the inside and outside billiards are equivalent in low or high magnetic field .",
    "in fact , it is possible to show that the inside ",
    "outside duality remains true for backward skipping trajectories , even for intermediate magnetic field .",
    "thus , theorem [ th2 ] is valid for outside as well as for inside billiards , implying that this large class of billiards is not ergodic .",
    "more generally , one can consider domains which are not convex , but whose boundary has a bounded curvature : @xmath78 .",
    "it is possible to show that point 1",
    ".  of theorem [ th2 ] remains true if @xmath71 , which is once again a manifestation of the stabilyzing effect of the magnetic field . in this case , it is of particular interest to consider the strong magnetic field limit .",
    "assume the boundary is @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and has a bounded curvature .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath65 , the bouncing map is @xmath81 and takes the form @xmath82 the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 are uniformly bounded for @xmath85 , @xmath86-periodic in @xmath87 , and admit expansions in @xmath65 which can be explicitly computed .",
    "the bouncing map ( [ tmu ] ) has the structure of a perturbed integrable map , where the factors @xmath88 ensure that the boundaries @xmath89 are fixed .",
    "one can again study invariant curves , of the form @xmath90 , using moser s theorem , although the analysis is complicated by the fact that the frequency @xmath91 is multiplied by the small parameter @xmath65 and is not monotonic .",
    "an alternative approach to kam theory is to construct _ adiabatic invariants _ @xmath92 , such that @xmath93 is as small as possible .    [ th3 ]",
    "if the boundary @xmath3 is @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and has bounded curvature , there exists a function @xmath92 such that @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath3 is analytic , there exists a function @xmath92 such that @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , theorem [ th3 ] is true for a large class of maps , including ( [ tmu ] ) . in the case of a billiard",
    ", @xmath96 if the boundary is analytic , theorem [ th3 ] implies that for _ any _ initial condition @xmath97 , @xmath98 remains at a distance of order @xmath65 from the level curve @xmath99 , during a time of order @xmath100 .",
    "we now consider the case where the potential is given by a uniform electric field , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "one can introduce dimensionless variables such that the lagrangian becomes @xmath103 where @xmath104 measures the strength of the electric field .",
    "the trajectories are cycloids of the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 reduces to the larmor radius when @xmath107 . to account for the conservation of energy @xmath108",
    ", we introduce a second parameter @xmath109 , so that @xmath110 .",
    "the range of the tangent velocity is @xmath111 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the following problem was studied : consider the billiard outside a circular scatterer , parametrized by @xmath112 .",
    "are there trajectories which remain `` trapped '' in the vicinity of the scatterer , in spite of the drift due to the electric field ?",
    "in fact , one can easily show that a particle drifting in from infinity will leave the scatterer again with probability one ( fig .",
    "however , it is possible that some trajectories bounce on the scatterer indefinitely in the past and in the future , forming a classical `` bound state '' . to show this , we first need to construct the generating function . given two end points @xmath11 and @xmath15 , we have to determine the equation of the corresponding cycloid ( [ scat2 ] ) , and use the general formula ( [ g ] ) .",
    "the perturbative result is :    let @xmath113 .",
    "there are positive constants @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , such that for @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the generating function of the bouncing map is unique , an analytic function of @xmath120 , @xmath65 and @xmath121 , and admits the expansion @xmath122 \\sin s_+   \\label{genscat } \\\\ & & +   \\eps^2\\left[\\left(\\frac{(c+r)^2s}{\\mu^2r } + \\frac{c+r}{r}\\dpsi   + \\frac{\\mu^2}{4rs}\\dpsi^2\\right ) \\sin^2 s_+ - \\frac{r}{4s}\\dpsi^2   \\right ] + \\order{\\eps^3},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 denote functions of @xmath126 alone : @xmath127 .",
    "\\label{gen2}\\ ] ]    the point is that the generating function has the form @xmath128 .",
    "if we substitute this expression in ( [ defg ] ) , we obtain that the bouncing map has the structure of a perturbed integrable map :    there is a positive @xmath129 such that for @xmath130 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the trajectory returns to the boundary , the bouncing map is analytic and of the form @xmath131    this result asserts that the particle will return to the scatterer if it starts with a sufficiently large normal velocity .",
    "the problem is now to show that some of these trajectories indefinitely return to the scatterer .",
    "this can be achieved once again by using moser s theorem : indeed the existence of two distinct invariant curves in phase space implies the region between them to be invariant under the map .",
    "there is a positive @xmath132 such that for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the scattering system has a set of bound states with positive measure .",
    "the problem with kam theory is that one has in general very bad estimates on the bound @xmath132 .",
    "one can improve them by studying periodic orbits , which can be surrounded by islands of stability for much higher values of the electric field . as described in section 1",
    ", we can compute the two  point function @xmath135 and analyze its stationnary points ( for this purpose , we needed to know ( [ genscat ] ) at second order in @xmath121 ) . in this way we can prove the existence of two orbits of period 2 :    an orbit hitting the scatterer at @xmath136 , which is hyperbolic for small @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "an orbit hitting the scatterer at @xmath137 , where @xmath138 which is elliptic for @xmath139 ( fig .",
    "4b ) . using theorem [ th1 ]",
    ", we can show that if the orbit is elliptic , then it is stable with probability 1 with respect to @xmath140 .",
    "we have the estimation @xmath141 which is in good agreement with numerics ( roughly , bound states exist as long as the drift per cycle is smaller than the radius of the scatterer ) .",
    "this method of searching elliptic orbits can be used to study existence of bound states for more general scatterers .",
    "in fact , if the billiard posseses elliptic orbits in zero electric field , they will generically survive small perturbations .",
    "interesting open problems include ( 1 ) the existence of a critical electric field beyond which there are _ no _ bound states , and ( 2 ) an understanding of transport in phase space , and its influence on the transit time of a particle drifting in from infinity .",
    "much of the work presented here is the result of fruitful collaborations with h.  kunz and with a.  hansen , e.  h.  hauge , j.  piasecki .",
