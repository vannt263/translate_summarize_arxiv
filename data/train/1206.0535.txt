    "there is much ongoing experimental effort by the atlas and cms collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) to search for the neutral higgs boson ( @xmath15 ) of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "this model of spontaneous symmetry breaking will be tested at the lhc over all of the theoretically preferred mass range , in an experimental programme which is expected to be completed by the end of the @xmath16 tev run of the lhc .",
    "after analysing all of the data taken at @xmath17 tev @xcite there are only two regions for the mass of @xmath15 which have not been excluded at 95% c.l : i ) a region of light mass , roughly corresponding to @xmath18 , and ii ) a region of heavy mass , @xmath19 gev . at present",
    "there is much speculation about an excess of events suggesting a mass of around 125 gev , especially in the channel @xmath0 @xcite where the excess is a bit larger than that expected for a sm higgs boson of the same mass .",
    "more data is needed to clarify if this small excess is a fluctuation of the background , or if it is genuine production of a higgs boson .",
    "several recent studies @xcite fit the current data in all the higgs search channels to the case of a neutral higgs boson with arbitrary couplings .",
    "a sm - like higgs boson gives a good fit to the data , although a slight preference for non - sm like higgs couplings is emphasised in @xcite .    the higgs sector of the sm , which consists of one fundamental scalar with a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , might not be nature s choice .",
    "there could be additional scalar fields which also contribute to the masses of the fermions and weak bosons , with a more complicated scalar potential which depends on several arbitrary parameters .",
    "importantly , even in the event of no signal for a sm - like higgs boson at the lhc , the search for scalar particles should continue in earnest due to the fact that a non - minimal higgs sector can give rise to different experimental signatures , some of which are challenging to detect .",
    "consequently , it will take much longer for the lhc to probe all of the parameter space of such models .",
    "various interpretations of the excess of events at around 125 gev have been proposed in the context of models with two higgs doublets in @xcite , with a review of such models in @xcite .",
    "early studies of non - minimal higgs sectors which can give rise to an enhanced br@xmath20 can be found in @xcite ( in which the enhancement is caused by increasing the partial width of @xmath0 ) and in @xcite ( in which the dominate tree - level decays modes such as @xmath21 are suppressed . )    the higgs triplet model ( htm ) @xcite is a model of neutrino mass generation with a non - minimal higgs sector .",
    "the model predicts several scalar particles , including a doubly charged higgs boson ( @xmath1 ) and a singly charged higgs boson ( @xmath22 ) , for which direct searches are being carried out at the lhc @xcite . in a large part of the parameter space of the htm",
    "the lightest cp - even scalar ( @xmath5 ) has essentially the same couplings to the fermions and vector bosons as the higgs boson of the sm @xcite .",
    "therefore the ongoing searches for the sm higgs boson also apply to @xmath5 of the htm with very little modification .",
    "an exception is the loop - induced decay @xmath7 which receives contributions from virtual @xmath1 and @xmath22 , and can have a branching ratio which is very different to that of the sm higgs boson . as shown recently in @xcite , the ongoing limits on br(@xmath7 ) constrain the parameter space of @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath9 is a quartic coupling in the scalar potential ( see also @xcite for a related study ) .",
    "the case of @xmath12 was studied in @xcite , which leads to destructive interference between the combined sm contribution ( from @xmath23 and fermion loops ) and the contribution from @xmath1 . in this work",
    "we consider the case of @xmath10 , which leads to constructive interference and was not considered in @xcite .",
    "the scenario of @xmath10 is more constrained by the ongoing searches for @xmath7 than the case of @xmath12 . moreover , the scenario of @xmath10 can provide enhancements of @xmath7 with smaller @xmath24 than the case of @xmath12 .",
    "our work is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly describe the theoretical structure of the htm . in section",
    "iii we present the formulae for the contribution of @xmath1 and @xmath22 to @xmath7 , and we summarise the ongoing searches for these particles at the lhc .",
    "section iv contains our numerical results , with conclusions in section v.",
    "in the htm  @xcite a @xmath25 complex @xmath26 isospin triplet of scalar fields , @xmath27 , is added to the sm lagrangian .",
    "such a model can provide majorana masses for the observed neutrinos without the introduction of @xmath26 singlet neutrinos via the gauge invariant yukawa interaction : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is a complex and symmetric coupling , @xmath30 is the dirac charge conjugation operator , @xmath31 are the pauli matrices , @xmath32 is a left - handed lepton doublet , and @xmath33 is a @xmath34 representation of the @xmath25 complex triplet fields : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "a non - zero triplet vev @xmath39 gives rise to the following mass matrix for neutrinos : @xmath40 the necessary non - zero @xmath41 arises from the minimisation of the most general @xmath42 invariant higgs potential  @xcite , which is written as follows  @xcite ( with @xmath43 ) :    @xmath44    here @xmath45 in order to ensure non - zero @xmath46 which spontaneously breaks @xmath47 to @xmath48 while @xmath49 . the scalar potential in eq .",

    "the expression for @xmath51 resulting from the minimisation of @xmath52 is : @xmath53    for @xmath54 one has @xmath55 , which would naturally lead to a small @xmath51 even for @xmath56 of the order of the electroweak scale ( and is sometimes called the `` type ii seesaw mechanism '' ) .",
    "however , in this scenario the triplet scalars would be too heavy to be observed at the lhc . in recent years",
    "there has been much interest in the case of light triplet scalars ( @xmath57 ) within the discovery reach of the lhc , for which eq .",
    "( [ tripletvev ] ) leads to @xmath58 , and this is the scenario we will focus on .",
    "the case of @xmath59 is assumed in the ongoing searches at the lhc , for which the brs of the triplet scalars to leptonic final states ( e.g.  @xmath60 ) would be @xmath61 . since @xmath58 for light triplet scalars then @xmath56 must also be small ( compared to the electroweak scale ) for the scenario of @xmath59 . moreover ,",
    "if one requires that the triplet yukawa couplings @xmath62 are greater in magnitude than the smallest yukawa coupling in the sm ( i.e.  the electron yukawa coupling , @xmath63 ) then from eq .",
    "( [ nu_mass ] ) one has @xmath59 , and thus the decays of the triplet scalars to leptonic final states have brs which sum to @xmath61 . in extensions of the htm",
    "the term @xmath64 ) , which is the only source of explicit lepton number violation , may arise in various ways : i ) it can be generated at tree level via the vev of a higgs singlet field  @xcite ; ii ) it can arise at higher orders in perturbation theory  @xcite ; iii ) it can originate in the context of extra dimensions  @xcite , and iv ) in the context of other extensions of the htm @xcite .    the branching ratios  ( brs ) for @xmath65 depend on @xmath66 and are predicted in the htm in terms of the parameters of the neutrino mass matrix  @xcite .",
    "detailed quantitative studies of br(@xmath65 ) in the htm have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite with particular emphasis given to their sensitivity to the majorana phases and the absolute neutrino mass i.e.  parameters which can not be probed in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "a study on the relation between br(@xmath65 ) and the neutrinoless double beta decay was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath51 can be obtained from considering its effect on the parameter @xmath67 . in the sm @xmath68 at tree - level , while in the htm one has ( where @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 the measurement @xmath71 leads to the bound @xmath72 , or @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the vev of the doublet field @xmath74 is essentially equal to the vev of the higgs boson of the sm ( i.e. @xmath75 gev ) . at the 1-loop level @xmath51",
    "must be renormalised @xcite , and the first explicit analysis in the context of the htm has recently been performed in @xcite , with bounds on @xmath51 similar to those of the tree - level analysis .",
    "the scalar eigenstates in the htm are as follows : i ) the charged scalars @xmath1 and @xmath76 ; ii ) the cp - even neutral scalars @xmath5 and @xmath77 ; iii ) a cp - odd neutral scalar @xmath78 .",
    "the doubly charged @xmath1 is entirely composed of the triplet scalar field @xmath79 , while the remaining eigenstates are in general mixtures of the doublet and triplet fields .",
    "however , such mixing is proportional to the triplet vev , and hence small _ even if _ @xmath51 assumes its largest value of a few gev .",
    "the expressions for the mixing angle in the cp - even sector @xmath80 and charged higgs sector @xmath81 are : @xmath82 we note that a large mixing angle ( including maximal mixing , @xmath83 is possible in the cp - even sector provided that @xmath84  @xcite , but we will not consider this parameter space in this work . the above approximation for @xmath85 is valid as long as @xmath86 is larger than @xmath87 by 5 gev or so .",
    "therefore @xmath88 are predominantly composed of the triplet fields , while @xmath5 is predominantly composed of the doublet field and plays the role of the sm higgs boson . neglecting the small off - diagonal elements in the cp - even mass matrix , the approximate expressions for the squared masses of @xmath5 and @xmath77 are as follows :",
    "@xmath89 the squared mass of the ( dominantly triplet ) cp - odd @xmath78 is given by : @xmath90 the squared mass of the ( dominantly triplet ) @xmath76 is given by : @xmath91 finally , the squared mass of the ( purely triplet ) doubly - charged scalar ( @xmath92 ) is given by : @xmath93 one can see that the squared mass of the ( dominantly doublet ) @xmath5 is simply given by @xmath94 , as in the sm . in the expressions for the masses of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 there is a common term @xmath99 .",
    "it is evident that the mass scales for @xmath5 and the dominantly triplet scalars ( @xmath100 ) are unrelated , the former being set by @xmath94 and the latter by @xmath99 . neglecting the terms which are proportional to the small parameter @xmath51 , one can see that there are only two possible mass hierarchies for the triplet scalars , with the magnitude of the mass splitting being controlled by @xmath101 ( and @xmath102 when @xmath51 is neglected ) : @xmath103 in our numerical analysis we choose the following seven parameters from the scalar potential to be the input parameters : @xmath104 therefore @xmath105 and @xmath56 are determined from the above parameters .",
    "many previous works have studied the impact of singly charged scalars on the decay @xmath106 e.g. in the context of the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) @xcite , a two - higgs doublet model @xcite and the next - to - mssm @xcite .",
    "the contribution of doubly charged scalars to this decay has received comparatively very little attention . in the context of a 3 - 3 - 1 model . ] a study in the context of a little higgs model was performed in @xcite , but the magnitude of the contribution from @xmath1 was shown to be much smaller than that of the singly charged scalar in the same model , due to the theoretical structure of the scalar potential .",
    "recently the impact of the contribution from @xmath1 was studied in the htm in @xcite , and was shown to give a sizeable contribution to @xmath106 . in @xcite both enhancements and suppressions were discussed , while in @xcite only suppressions were studied .",
    "we will closely follow the analysis of @xcite . note that the loop - induced decay @xmath107 would also receive contributions from @xmath1 and @xmath22 , but we will not consider this decay in this work because it is not expected to be observable in the early stages of operation of the lhc .",
    "we will consider the parameter space where @xmath5 is essentially composed of the doublet field , while @xmath77 is essentially composed of the neutral triplet field , which is realised in a large region of the parameter space of the htm . in this case",
    "both @xmath77 and @xmath78 will be difficult to observe in the 8 tev run of the lhc due to their small couplings to quarks and vector bosons , and so they can only be produced in reasonable amounts by mechanisms such as @xmath108 ( as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the mass limits from the searches for the sm higgs in the interval @xmath109 gev do not apply to @xmath77 and @xmath78 since their production cross sections are much smaller than that for @xmath110 .",
    "the explicit form of the decay width for @xmath111 is as follows @xcite : @xmath112 here @xmath80 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath113 is the number of quark colours , @xmath114 is the electric charge of the fermion in the loop , and @xmath115 @xmath116 .",

    "the couplings of @xmath5 to the vector bosons and fermions relative to the values in the sm are as follows : @xmath123 from eq  .([alpha_beta ] ) one has @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , and so it is clear that the above couplings of @xmath5 are essentially identical to those of the sm higgs boson because @xmath126 .",

    "we note that the scenario of a large mixing angle @xmath233 @xcite ( for which @xmath84 is necessary ) could further delay detection of @xmath5 in these latter channels because the production cross sections of @xmath5 ( and @xmath77 ) would have a suppression factor of @xmath234 relative to that of the higgs boson of the sm , as well as having masses which differ by a few gev .",
    "the case of @xmath235 occurs for @xmath236 ( i.e. a negligible trilinear coupling @xmath3 ) , and also for a straight line which joins the points @xmath237 , @xmath238 gev and @xmath239 , @xmath240 gev .",
    "hence any signal for @xmath7 with @xmath203 ( and assuming @xmath241 gev ) would restrict the parameter space of @xmath222 $ ] to two regions : i ) the region of @xmath236 , and ii ) the region of @xmath242 .",
    "if @xmath1 is very heavy and out of the discovery reach of the lhc ( e.g. @xmath243 tev ) then @xmath203 could be accommodated with any positive and sizeable @xmath9 . as emphasised in @xcite ,",
    "in the region of @xmath244 and @xmath245 gev the contribution of the @xmath1 loop is so large that @xmath246 occurs .",
    "this region is still compatible with current lhc data , which excludes @xmath247 for @xmath87 around 125 gev , while @xmath248 is excluded for essentially all other choices of @xmath87 in the interval @xmath249 gev .",
    "the excess of @xmath13 events at 125 gev , if assumed to originate from a higgs boson , roughly corresponds to @xmath250 .",
    "if @xmath246 turns out to be preferred by lhc data then one interpretation in the htm would be the region of @xmath244 and @xmath245 gev @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the case of @xmath138 , for which @xmath246 .",
    "the current sensitivity to @xmath7 in the lhc searches is between @xmath251 in the mass range @xmath252 gev , and so the scenario of @xmath138 is now being probed by the ongoing searches .",
    "one can see that the current best fit value of @xmath250 can be accommodated by values of @xmath24 which are much smaller than for the case of @xmath253 , e.g. @xmath254 can be obtained for @xmath255 ( or @xmath256 ) and @xmath238 gev .",
    "importantly , any measured value of @xmath246 would be readily accommodated by the scenario @xmath10 , even for a relatively heavy @xmath1 , e.g. for @xmath181 gev one has @xmath257 .",
    "if either of the decays @xmath214 or @xmath185 is dominant ( for which there have been no direct searches ) then @xmath258 gev is not experimentally excluded , and larger enhancements of @xmath198 are possible e.g. @xmath259 and 1.9 for @xmath260 and @xmath261 , with @xmath238 gev .",
    "such large enhancements of @xmath198 would require a relatively light @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath262 gev ) which decays dominantly to @xmath214 and/or @xmath185 , for which there have been no direct searches .",
    "simulations of @xmath214 were performed in @xcite , with good detection prospects for @xmath262 gev .",
    "a parton - level study of @xmath185 ( for the signal only ) has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the above discussion was for the case of @xmath141 and we now discuss the effect of @xmath263 . in this case the couplings @xmath223 and @xmath224 in eq .",
    "( [ trilinhpp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ trilinhp ] ) are not equal ( as discussed in fig .  [ amp ] ) , and there is a mass splitting between @xmath8 and @xmath264 given by eq .",
    "( [ charged - mass ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ doub - charged - mass ] ) .",
    "therefore the contribution of @xmath1 to @xmath7 is not simply four times the contribution of @xmath76 at the amplitude level . in fig .",
    "[ rgam - hp ] we plot @xmath198 as a function of @xmath9 , fixing @xmath146 gev and taking @xmath147 gev , 250 gev and 300 gev ( corresponding to @xmath265 and @xmath266 respectively ) .",
    "one can see that the case of @xmath147 gev and @xmath10 leads to a value of @xmath198 which is roughly @xmath267 larger than the value for the case of @xmath268 .",
    "this due to the an increase of the magnitude of the coupling @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ trilinhp ] ) and also because of less suppression from the @xmath269 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : redgcalhhp ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath270 when @xmath271 due to the non - vanishing coupling @xmath134 for @xmath263 ( see also fig .  ( [ amp ] ) ) . for @xmath12",
    "the magnitude of @xmath134 is less than that of @xmath133 due to destructive interference in eq .",
    "( [ trilinhp ] ) , and at around @xmath272 the value of @xmath198 becomes equal to the case of @xmath268 . for @xmath273",
    "one finds again values of @xmath198 which are slightly larger than for the case of @xmath268 . for @xmath274 gev ( i.e. @xmath275 )",
    "the converse dependence of @xmath198 on @xmath9 is found .     in the plane of @xmath222 $ ] for @xmath276 gev ( left panel ) and @xmath277 gev ( right panel ) , for @xmath148 gev and @xmath278.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the plane of @xmath222 $ ] for @xmath276 gev ( left panel ) and @xmath277 gev ( right panel ) , for @xmath148 gev and @xmath278.,title=\"fig : \" ]     as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath146 gev , and @xmath147 gev , 250 gev and 300 gev , with @xmath148 gev . ]",
    "ongoing searches at the lhc for the decay @xmath0 are approaching sensitivity to the prediction for the sm higgs boson in the range @xmath279 gev .",
    "this data constrains models of new physics which enhance br(@xmath0 ) relative to the rate in the sm .",
    "a local excess of events is seen by both the cms and atlas experiments , which is consistent with a signal for the higgs boson of the sm with a mass of around 125 gev .",
    "doubly charged higgs bosons ( @xmath1 ) , which arise in the higgs triplet model ( htm ) of neutrino mass generation , can significantly alter the branching ratio of @xmath7 ( where @xmath5 is the lightest cp - even scalar in the htm ) , while the branching ratios of the dominant tree - level decays are essentially the same as those for the higgs boson of the sm .",
    "the contribution of the loops involving @xmath1 is mediated by a trilinear coupling @xmath280 , and its magnitude essentially depends on two parameters : an arbitrary quartic coupling ( @xmath9 ) and the mass of @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "consequently , the improving limits on br(@xmath7 ) from lhc data constrain the parameter space of @xmath222 $ ] .",
    "an additional ( and subdominant ) contribution comes from a loop with @xmath76 , and its magnitude is determined by @xmath9 , @xmath101 and @xmath136 . as recently pointed out in @xcite , for the case of @xmath139 the contribution of @xmath1 interferes destructively with that of the @xmath23 loop , and it can lead to a significant suppression of the branching ratio of br(@xmath7 ) . in this scenario",
    "much more data would be required to see a signal for @xmath7 in the htm at the lhc .",
    "for very large positive @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath281 ) and @xmath245 gev a sizeable enhancement of br(@xmath7 ) would be possible , and this parameter space is now being constrained by the lhc limits on br(@xmath7 ) , as well as being a possible explanation of the excess of events at 125 gev @xcite .    in this work we pointed out that constructive interference of the @xmath1 contribution with the @xmath23 contribution occurs for @xmath138 , and such a parameter space",
    "is consistent with theoretical constraints on @xmath9 from requiring the stability of the vacuum of the scalar potential . for @xmath282 gev ,",
    "which is roughly the bound if the decays @xmath60 decays are dominant in the htm , an enhancement of up to @xmath283 and @xmath284 is possible for @xmath285 and @xmath261 .",
    "conversely , if either of the decays @xmath214 or @xmath185 is dominant ( for which there have been no direct searches ) then @xmath258 gev is not experimentally excluded , and larger enhancements of @xmath286 and @xmath287 are possible for @xmath285 and @xmath261 with @xmath238 gev . consequently , the parameter space of @xmath14 in the htm is more tightly constrained by the ongoing searches for @xmath288 than the case of @xmath12 .",
    "importantly , the case of @xmath14 would readily accommodate any signal for @xmath7 with a branching ratio which is higher than that for the higgs boson , for _ smaller _ values of @xmath24 than for the case of @xmath139 .",
    "in such a scenario , dedicated searches at the lhc for the decay channels @xmath214 or @xmath185 with @xmath258 gev would be strongly motivated .",

    "<S> we point out the possibility of constructive interference of the @xmath1 contribution with that of the @xmath6 contribution , which enables a substantial enhancement of the branching ratio of @xmath7 in the htm . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the contribution of @xmath1 is essentially determined by the mass of @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) and a quartic scalar coupling ( @xmath9 ) , with constructive interference arising for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ongoing searches for @xmath0 restrict the parameter space of @xmath11 $ ] more stringently for @xmath10 than for the recently - studied case of destructive interference with @xmath12 . moreover , if the excess of @xmath13 events around a mass of 125 gev in the lhc searches for @xmath0 is substantiated with larger data samples , and the branching ratio is measured to be somewhat larger than that for the sm higgs boson , then such an enhancement could be readily accommodated by @xmath5 in the htm with @xmath14 . </S>"
