    "discovered almost 20 years ago , high-@xmath0 copper oxides still remain a challenge of the modern condensed matter physics .",
    "it is not only due to unconventional superconducting state with a highest superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 ever observed .",
    "also they reveal evolution from an undoped antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator to an almost conventional , though highly correlated @xcite , fermi liquid system at the overdoped side of the phase diagram . between these two regimes",
    "the system exhibits strongly correlated , or so - called `` pseudogap '' metallic behavior up to an optimal doping concentration @xmath6 .",
    "recent significant improvements of experimental techniques , especially of the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , revealed many exciting features of this doping dependent evolution .",
    "first of all , the fermi surface ( fs ) at low doping concentrations @xmath2 has been measured @xcite . together with the previous measurements on optimally and overdoped samples ( see e.g. review @xcite and references therein ) , these observations provide a unified picture of the doping dependent fs , which changes from the `` fermi arcs '' @xcite in the underdoped compounds to the `` large '' fermi surface in the overdoped systems . though this change is smooth , it occurs around the optimal doping concentration .",
    "also , the observed evolution is consistent with the hall coefficient @xmath7 measurements @xcite .",
    "the pseudogap behavior observed in arpes is also tracked in the transport measurements .",
    "in particular , the resistivity curvature mapping over @xmath8 phase diagram clearly demonstrates crossover between underdoped and overdoped regimes @xcite .",
    "and the in - plane resistivity @xmath9 shows @xmath10-linear dependence only around @xmath11 .",
    "the drastic change of the quasiparticle dynamics around the optimal doping was found by the time - resolved measurements of the photoinduced change in reflectivity for bi@xmath12sr@xmath12ca@xmath13dy@xmath14cu@xmath12o@xmath15 ( bscco ) @xcite .",
    "namely , the spectral weight shifts expected for a bcs superconductor can account for the photoinduced response in overdoped , but not underdoped bscco .",
    "this agrees with the observed difference of the low - frequency spectral weight transfer in normal and superconducting states on under- and over - doped samples @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the integral characteristics of the system demonstrate more smooth behavior upon increase of the doping @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of the chemical potential shift @xmath16 on @xmath2 shows pinning at @xmath17 , and evolves smoothly at higher doping concentrations @xcite .",
    "the measured nodal fermi velocity @xmath18 is almost doping - independent within experimental error of 20% @xcite .",
    "the experiments involving combination of dc transport and infrared spectroscopy revealed an almost constant effective electron mass @xmath19 in the underdoped and slightly overdoped la@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath22 ( lsco ) and yba@xmath12cu@xmath23o@xmath14 ( ybco ) @xcite .",
    "low-@xmath2 effective mass dependence contradicts predictions of the brinkman - rice metal - insulator transition theory @xcite , predicting divergence of the @xmath24 at the point of transition .",
    "one of the main drawbacks in this theory is that the magnetic correlations were neglected .",
    "thus the discrepancy with the experiment emphasizes the importance of these correlations in high-@xmath0 copper oxides .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the description of the crossover between almost localized picture and the fermi liquid regime is very difficult .",
    "starting from the fermi liquid approach one may discuss the overdoped and , partly , optimally doped region , while for underdoped and undoped samples this approach is not applicable .",
    "the strong - coupling gutzwiller approximation @xcite for the hubbard model provides a good description for the correlated metallic system .",
    "this approximation is equivalent @xcite to the mean - field saddle - point solution within a slave - boson approach @xcite . at the same time , as shown within @xmath25 expansion @xcite , with @xmath26 being the dimensionality of the lattice , the gutzwiller approximation is equivalent to the case of @xmath27 .",
    "obviously , for the quasi - two - dimensional systems such as high-@xmath0 copper oxides this is not a proper limit .",
    "the same applies to the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , which is exact only for @xmath27 . in this limit",
    "the short - range magnetic fluctuations are excluded .",
    "it is not a good starting point for the system with long - range afm order at low @xmath2 and short - range afm correlations in the underdoped region .    to describe the doping dependent evolution of the low - energy excitations we develop a strong - coupling mean - field theory for the paramagnetic non - superconductive phase of high-@xmath0 copper oxides starting from the local limit . to go beyond the usual hubbard - i approximation a self - consistently calculated static spin - spin and kinematic correlation functions",
    "are taken into account .",
    "within this approximation in the framework of the effective @xmath1 model with _ ab initio _ calculated parameters we obtain a doping - dependent evolution of the fs , effective mass and nodal fermi velocity .",
    "the analysis of the low - energy excitations behavior for p - type cuprates yields two quantum phase transitions associated with the change of the fs topology . for n - type cuprates",
    "we observe only single quantum critical concentration .",
    "the key aspect in these findings is an adequate description of the electron scattering by the short range magnetic fluctuations accompanied by the three - site correlated hoppings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : model ] the effective model and the approximations",
    "are described .",
    "the results of the calculations for p - type cuprates are presented in section  [ section : ptype ] .",
    "also , the critical comparison of the @xmath1 and @xmath28 models is made , and the role of short range magnetic order is discussed .",
    "section  [ section : ntype ] contains results for n - type cuprates .",
    "the last section summarize this study , and the main points are discussed .",
    "high-@xmath0 cuprates belong to a class of strongly correlated systems where the standard local density approximation ( lda ) schemes and the weak - coupling perturbation theories yield an inappropriate results . to overcome this difficulty recently we have developed an lda+gtb method @xcite . in this method the _ ab initio _ lda calculation is used to construct the wannier functions and to obtain the single electron and coulomb parameters of the multiband hubbard - type model . within this model",
    "the electronic structure in the strong correlation regime is calculated by the generalized tight - binding ( gtb ) method @xcite .",
    "the latter combines the exact diagonalization of the model hamiltonian for a small cluster ( unit cell ) with perturbative treatment of the intercluster hopping and interactions . for undoped and weakly doped lsco and nd@xmath20ce@xmath21cuo@xmath22 ( ncco ) this scheme results in a charge transfer insulator with a correct value of the gap and the dispersion of bands in agreement with the experimental arpes data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    then this multiband hubbard - type hamiltonian was mapped onto an effective low - energy model @xcite .",
    "parameters of this effective model were obtained directly from the _ ab initio _ parameters of the multiband model .",
    "the low - energy model appears to be the @xmath1 model ( @xmath28 model with the three - site correlated hoppings ) for n - type cuprates and the _ singlet - triplet _ @xmath1 model for p - type systems .",
    "however , for @xmath29 in a phase without a long - range magnetic order the role of the triplet state and the singlet - triplet hybridization is negligible @xcite .",
    "therefore , the triplet state could be omitted and in the present paper we will describe the low - energy excitations in the single - layer p- and n - type cuprates within the @xmath1 model .    to write down the model hamiltonian we use the hubbard @xmath30-operators @xcite : @xmath31 .",

    "the commutation relations between x - operators are quite complicated , i.e. two operators commute on another operator , not a @xmath37-number",
    ". nevertheless , depending on the difference of the number of fermions in states @xmath35 and @xmath38 it is possible to define quasi - fermi and quasi - bose type operators in terms of obeyed statistics . in this notations",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath1 model in the hole representation have the form : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the chemical potential , @xmath41 is the spin operator , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the number of particles operator , @xmath46 is the exchange parameter , @xmath47 is the charge - transfer gap . in the notations of ref",
