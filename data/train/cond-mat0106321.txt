    "the discovery , by bednorz and mller@xcite in 1986 , of the new family of cuprate - based high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , has had a profound impact on research in the field of superconductivity .",
    "in particular , due to their anisotropy , short coherence lengths and high critical temperatures , it quickly became obvious that thermal fluctuations will play a key role in the physics of interacting flux lines in these materials .",
    "early experiments@xcite suggested , and it was later unambiguously confirmed@xcite , that a phase transition takes place where the three dimensional abrikosov@xcite flux line lattice ( fll ) lattice melts into a flux line liquid , and the location of the melting temperature @xmath2 as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath3 in the @xmath4 phase diagram of the flux line system became the subject of intense experimental and theoretical@xcite investigations ( see blatter et _",
    "al._@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the early approaches aimed at describing the melting transition and the physics of melted flux line liquids was the theory of nelson and seung@xcite , which is based on the observation@xcite that the partition function of a system of interacting flux lines in @xmath5 dimensions can be mapped onto the imaginary time partition function of a system of interacting quantum mechanical bosons in two dimensions .",
    "this formal mapping was used to obtain a complete description of flux line liquids by using well known techniques from boson physics .",
    "the physical picture of the flux line liquid which emerges from this description suggests that there is considerable wandering of flux lines as they traverse the sample and that the flux line liquid is heavily entangled over much of the liquid phase .",
    "such a picture has been observed in numerical simulations , and it is now generally believed that the mean square relative displacement @xmath6 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] of the transverse position @xmath7 of a given flux line in a flux line liquid has the same form as the corresponding quantity for an isolated flux line , namely  : @xmath8 the only effect of the interactions between lines in a dense liquid being to reduce@xcite the `` diffusion '' constant @xmath9 from its bare value @xmath10 for a single flux line , which is given by@xcite  : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 is the temperature and @xmath14 is the tilt modulus of a single flux line .",
    "similarly , the mean square projected area occupied by the lines is found , within the boson picture , to be of order@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath1 is the sample thickness in the direction of the flux lines ( which we take parallel to the @xmath17 axis ) .",
    "this last result is to be contrasted with the mean square projected area of a given flux line in the crystalline phase , which is given by@xcite  : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the average spacing between flux lines in the vortex lattice , @xmath20 is the ratio of the london penetration depths in the @xmath21 plane and along the direction of the @xmath22 axis respectively ( we remind the reader that most htsc have uniaxial symmetry , and we denote by @xmath22 the principal axis of symmetry of the crystal ) , and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the flux quantum@xcite . comparing the results ( [ area ] ) and ( [ usqrd - crystal ] ) , we see that , while the mean square projected area of flux lines @xmath25 in the crystalline phase is finite , in the liquid phase it diverges with the sample thickness @xmath1 .    despite a good deal of both theoretical @xcite and experimental work@xcite and rather extensive numerical studies @xcite , several questions regarding the physics of flux line liquids remain open .",
    "one of the most important questions which has been the subject of intense debate during the past few years@xcite , is related to whether a disentangled flux line liquid can survive above melting .",
    "although early numerical simulations have provided support for the proposal by feigelman et _",
    "al._@xcite that superconducting coherence could survive in the liquid phase , more extensive simulations by several authors@xcite found that longitudinal coherence vanishes simultaneously with melting , and that the vortex liquid is characterized by very short entanglement lengths in the direction of the flux lines .",
    "however , analyses of experiments on high quality untwinned single crystals of yba@xmath26cu@xmath27o@xmath28 ( ybco ) by righi et _ al._@xcite and by moore@xcite have suggested that longitudinal correlations in the liquid phase may be of surprizingly larger micron scale .    at the fundamental level",
    ", it is very important to understand , from a purely conceptual point of view , under what circumstances a disentangled state can emerge from a theoretical description , and what kind of theories are best suited to yield such a disentangled state .",
    "we first note that , for a disentangled state to appear , it is necessary that flux line conformation variables @xmath7 have correlations which do _ not _ obey equations ( [ correlator])-([area ] ) .",
    "in particular , the average projected area of a given flux line @xmath29 has to be independent of the sample thickness @xmath1 . in the crystalline phase ,",
    "transverse fluctuations of a given flux line are confined thanks to the repulsive action of the other , neighboring lines in the fll . in a similar way",
    ", physical intuition suggests that the interactions between flux lines should strongly reduce@xcite and might even suppress line wandering if the repulsion energy between flux lines is high enough compared to @xmath30 .",
    "in such a disentangled state with large repulsion forces between the lines , a given flux line will experience the repulsive potential of its surrounding neighbors in much the same way as in a lattice . as a result",
    ", the internal fluctuations of that line will be confined in about the same way they are confined in regular abrikosov fll .",
    "in particular , there should be a regime where the mean square internal fluctuations @xmath29 does not differ much , at least locally , from the corresponding quantity in a fll at the same density . for us to be able to describe a putative disentangled phase of a flux line liquid , that is , a phase where fluctuations of flux lines are confined",
    ", we need to concentrate on the individual conformation variables of the flux lines , and try to evaluate the effect of interactions on these variables in the most accurate way possible .",
    "in fact , most theoretical studies to date have concentrated on hydrodynamic quantities , such as , _",
    "e.g. _ the density , and have used approximations pertinent to linear hydrodynamics in order to study the physics of flux line liquids .",
    "hydrodynamic observables being coarse - grained quantities , such approaches are intrinsically unable to give an accurate picture of the correlations of flux line conformation variables , such as @xmath31 . even if we go beyond linear hydrodynamics , such as in ref.@xcite , because of the use of coarse - grained variables , we expect not to be able to describe the confinement of individual flux line fluctuations that would take place in a hypothetical , disentangled flux line liquid . to the most , hydrodynamic approaches can only yield a renormalization of the tilt modulus of flux lines in a line liquid , leaving the qualitative ( analytic ) form of the correlations ( [ correlator])-([area ] ) unchanged .    in view of the above remarks",
    ", it seems to us that it is highly desirable to construct a theory which keeps track in a better way of conformation variables of the flux lines , and which would therefore be able to yield more accurate information about the correlations of these variables .",
    "shuch a theory would undoubtedly help us gain a better understanding of the properties of flux line liquids .    in this paper , which is largely motivated by the conclusions of reference@xcite , we would like to lay out the path for the construction of such a theory .",
    "we show , in particular , that a classical theory of flux liquids with a better handling of the internal modes of flux lines can be formulated which is simple enough to allow for ease of mathematical treatment , and which is transparent enough to allow for approximations to be made with a good level of confidence . within this approach , and under _ certain assumptions _ , we find that a confinement of the internal fluctuations of the lines can indeed take place , at least in the limit of a dilute flux line liquid .",
    "more specifically , we find that , due to the interactions between flux lines , the internal modes may actually become massive , leading to a finite mean square width @xmath0 of flux lines , and to a qualitative change in the behaviour of the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory - disentangled ] , we consider a liquid of interacting flux lines in a weakly anisotropic htsc . performing a perturbative expansion of the interaction energy in terms of the internal fluctuations of the flux lines , we show that the interactions with neighboring lines induce a mass term in the hamiltonian of the internal modes . as a result , we find that the internal fluctuations of the flux lines are strongly suppressed compared with the free flux line result ( [ area ] ) .",
    "we self - consistently determine the range of validity of our perturbative expansion , which is found to be quite large for moderately anisotropic superconductors .",
    "we also calculate the structure factor of the flux line liquid and our result is compared to previous derivations .",
    "section [ conclusions ] contains a discussion of our findings , which we think can be reconciled with the results of numerical simulations , along with our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we shall be considering the statistical mechanics of an assembly of flux lines in a sample of thickness @xmath1 of a uniaxial htsc , with both the principal axis of anisotropy @xmath22 and the external magnetic field aligned with the @xmath17 axis .",
    "such a system can be described by the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the tilt modulus per unit length of the flux lines ( here @xmath34 and @xmath19 are the coherence length and the average distance between flux lines in the @xmath21 plane respectively ) , and where @xmath35 is the interaction potential between flux line elements at equal height , with @xmath36 a modified bessel function@xcite .",
    "( henceforth , we shall neglect the logarithmic factor @xmath37 , of order unity , in the definition of the tilt modulus , writing @xmath38 . )",
    "the hamiltonian above may be viewed as a simplified version of the most general hamiltonian of arbitrarily curved and tilted flux lines in the london regime of anisotropic superconductors @xcite ( with nonlocal interactions in the @xmath39 direction ) , and can be shown to be a good approximation to the latter in the limit of nearly straight flux lines@xcite .",
    "the tilt modulus per unit _ length _",
    "@xmath14 on the other hand can be viewed as the effective tilt modulus for long - wavelength @xmath40 distortions which accounts for the most relevant fluctuations of the flux lines near melting , with transverse wavelength @xmath41 ( @xmath42 being the transverse wavevector at the brillouin zone boundary ) , as can be seen by replacing @xmath43 , taking the limit @xmath44 in the general ( nonlocal ) expression of the tilt modulus per unit _ volume _ @xmath45 , and multiplying by the elementary area per vortex @xmath46 .",
    "below , it will prove useful to write the following fourier decomposition of @xmath7 into rouse modes@xcite  : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and where the coefficients @xmath49 are given by  : @xmath50 as can be verified by using the orthogonality relation @xmath51 it will also be convenient to write @xmath7 as the sum @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the center of mass ( cm ) position , while @xmath31 is the displacement of the flux line at height @xmath39 with respect to the center of mass position . in terms of the fourier modes",
    "@xmath54 , the displacement vector @xmath31 can be written in the form ( here @xmath55 denotes complex conjugation )  : @xmath56    using the above decomposition of the flux line positions @xmath57 into cm and internal modes , equation ( [ decomp ] ) , the interaction term between flux line elements at @xmath7 and @xmath58 can be written as @xmath59 since the interaction potential @xmath60 is a smooth function which varies very slowly on length scales much smaller than @xmath61 , we see that if @xmath62 then we can write , to a very good approximation  : @xmath63\\cdot \\nabla v\\big({\\bf r}_{0i}-{\\bf r}_{0j}\\big ) + \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\big([{\\bf u}_i(z)-{\\bf u}_j(z)]\\cdot\\nabla\\big)^2v\\big({\\bf r}_{0i}-{\\bf r}_{0j}\\big ) \\label{taylorexpansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we integrate this last equation over @xmath39 , taking into account the fact that @xmath64 , we obtain @xmath65\\ , \\partial_\\alpha\\partial_\\beta v\\big({\\bf r}_{0i}-{\\bf r}_{0j}\\big ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the boson language , this last equation is reminiscent of the expansion of the action of a quantum particle around a classical path @xcite .",

    "the couplings @xmath229 are given by @xmath230 when sites @xmath159 and @xmath160 are located on the same superconducting plane , with @xmath231 , and @xmath232 when sites @xmath159 and @xmath160 are located at @xmath233 from each other , where @xmath144 is the spacing between superconducting layers .",
    "within the model ( [ 3dxy ] ) , evidence for an entangled state is deduced from various dynamical quantities , such as the helicity modulus @xmath234 which gives the linear response of the supercurrent @xmath235 to a transverse perturbation in the vector potential @xmath236 of the externally applied magnetic field  : @xmath237 the helicity modulus measures the response of the system to an imposed phase twist@xcite , and is therefore related to the correlation function ( here @xmath238 ) @xmath239 which measures the coherence of the phase degrees of freedom in the system . also measured in numerical simulations of model ( [ 3dxy ] ) is the structure factor @xmath240 , where the density operator @xmath241 is given in terms of the phase variables @xmath242 by @xmath243\\cdot\\hat{\\bf z}\\ ] ] information about entanglement and longitudinal correlations is then deduced from the behaviour of the structure factor @xmath244 at zero transverse separations .",
    "another model which has been used in numerical studies of flux liquids is the so - called lattice london model , which is defined by the hamiltonian@xcite @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the integer vorticity through plaquette @xmath124 at site @xmath247 of a cubic mesh of points , and @xmath248 is the same coupling as the one defined above in the context of the uniformly frustrated 3d xy model .",
    "the lattice london interactions @xmath249 have fourier transforms  : @xmath250 where @xmath251 and @xmath252 . unlike the 3d xy model , which has coulomb like interactions between vortex elements@xcite and which is only valid in the regime @xmath253 of dense systems , the lattice london model takes screening into account and can therefore be used for dense as well as for dilute flux liquids .",
    "the last kind of simulation which has been performed is the monte carlo simulation of nordborg and blatter@xcite who use the boson mapping@xcite to simulate a system of interacting flux lines . in this approach ,",
    "the authors adapt an algorithm which has been used in the past@xcite to study superfluidity in quantum - mechanical bose systems , involving large scale permutations of vortex trajectories subject to the `` periodic '' boundary conditions @xmath254 , _",
    "i.e. _ every line ends either on itself or on another line .",
    "below we comment on this monte carlo method and the associated algorithm , but , before doing so , we want to consider the two other simulation methods , models ( [ 3dxy ] ) and ( [ lattice - london ] ) .",
    "we first observe that a direct comparison between our results and simulations of the uniformly frustrated 3d xy model ( [ 3dxy ] ) is made difficult by the fact that , while this model is relevant to the case @xmath253 , we here consider the opposite limit @xmath193 of a dilute flux line liquid .",
    "in addition , and as we already mentioned , most of the simulations above were concerned with the measurement of the helicity modulus , which is essentially a measure of _ phase _ correlations in the system .",
    "it should be noted , however , that phase correlations can be very different from density correlations . to illustrate this statement",
    ", we refer the reader to ref.@xcite , where it was found within a simple elastic approach that the order parameter for phase correlations ( [ psi - phase ] ) decays exponentially in the direction of the superconducting planes in a three dimensional flux line _ lattice_@xcite , although the density order parameter @xmath255 is known to be finite in such a lattice .",
    "this example shows clearly that there is no `` one to one '' correspondence between phase and density correlations , and that the vanishing of the helicity modulus in a flux line liquid for example does not necessarily mean exponential decay of density correlations along the @xmath17 axis or correlations between flux line positions of the type of equations ( [ correlator])-([area ] ) .",
    "this is even more so if we allow for the formation of vortex loops .",
    "thermally excited vortex loop excitations were found @xcite to destroy phase coherence and to lead to a vanishing of the helicity modulus even in an otherwise perfectly ordered flux line lattice@xcite .",
    "finally , it should be realized that the simulations of models ( [ 3dxy ] ) and ( [ lattice - london ] ) are highly simplified representations of considerably more complex physics .",
    "for example , simulations are usually carried out at a given density of flux quanta @xmath256 ( we remind the reader that the upper critical field for @xmath257 is given by @xmath258 ) , with values of @xmath259 ranging from @xmath260 to @xmath261 most frequently used .",
    "values of @xmath259 in this range correspond to values of the induction @xmath262 in the range @xmath263 .",
    "apart from the fact that the use of models ( [ 3dxy ] ) and ( [ lattice - london ] ) , which are based on the assumption of a constant amplitude of the order parameter , becomes questionable in this range of fields , we also note that at such high fields vortices in adjacent superconducting planes in the liquid phase might very well be already decoupled@xcite ( note also that the temperature dependence of the coherence length @xmath264 in @xmath265 and of the london penetration depth @xmath61 in @xmath248 and @xmath266 is generally left out as @xmath13 is varied ) .",
    "moreover , in most of these simulations , which are carried out on a cubic mesh , the mesh constant in the @xmath17 direction is associated with the distance @xmath144 between superconducting planes in a layered material , and no mention is made whatsoever of the coherence length @xmath267 along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "in particular , the question regarding whether the same results , _",
    "e.g. _ for density correlations in the liquid phase , would follow in the regimes @xmath268 and @xmath269 , has largely remained untouched . the fact that most of these simulations consider _ implicitely _ the quasi - two - dimensional case@xcite @xmath268 does not allow us to draw any conclusions on the interesting regime @xmath270 where the average tilt angle of flux lines@xcite @xmath271 can be very small and where we expect superconducting coherence , whether it be for the phase of the superconducting order parameter or for the density , to survive on much longer length scales .",
    "several remarks are due regarding the monte carlo simulation of nordborg and blatter@xcite who use the boson mapping@xcite to simulate a system of interacting flux lines .",
    "first , the use of the `` periodic '' boundary conditions @xmath272 imposes additional constraints on the system which are _ not _ present in a real flux line liquid .",
    "actually , in order to `` capture the effects of bose statistics '' , the flux lines in this simulation were made to switch their endpoints _ by hand _ , and this might very well introduce an _ artificial _ entanglement in the system . more specifically , the switching of endpoints is achieved by cutting out sufficiently long segments of a number of lines and trying different ways of connecting the loose ends while satisfying the periodic boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "while this procedure and the corresponding algorithm are appropriate for the imaginary time paths of quantum mechanical bosons , we find it more realistic that the flux line system should be allowed to equilibrate with free ( as opposed to periodic ) boundary conditions and , more importantly , without explicit switching of endpoints . within the context of quantum mechanical bosons",
    ", superfluidity is brought about in numerical simulations by _ precisely _ these kind of manipulations . in the context of vortices",
    ", we expect these manipulations to lead to an overestimation of the effect of entanglement in flux liquids , and the `` superfluid '' behaviour found in reference @xcite might therefore be a direct consequence of the specific bosonic algorithm used in this simulation .    in view of all the above remarks , and the results of section [ theory - disentangled ] , it seems to us that there is still room , at least in the dilute limit considered in this paper and neglecting vortex loops , for a new phase of the flux line liquid which has not been considered in the past , and which we might describe as",
    "_ weakly entangled_. by `` weakly entangled '' flux liquid , we mean a liquid phase in which @xmath29 can be very large , but does not actually diverge with the sample thickness @xmath1 .",
    "for this to happen , a small value of the confining mass @xmath124 , much smaller than the one found in equation ( [ resultmu ] ) , is needed . in the following paragraph",
    ", we try to understand how such small values of @xmath124 can emerge from our model , and how a weakly entangled phase can be reconciled with what is observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the key quantity in the derivation of the confining mass of section [ theory - disentangled ] is the pair distribution function @xmath273 of the cm mode . in equation ( [ pair - distr - func ] )",
    ", we used an approximation for @xmath141 which is relevant to a situation where the average distance between the centers of mass of the flux lines is @xmath128 , and where the cm positions are strongly anti - correlated for @xmath274 , _",
    "i.e. _ if the cm of the @xmath159th flux line is at location @xmath275 , then the centers of mass of neighboring vortices have a very small probability to be within a distance @xmath19 from @xmath275 . while this is a perfectly legitimate way of thinking for actual flux line elements and for the regime @xmath146 considered in section [ theory - disentangled ] , since the cm is only a mathematical construct on one hand , and since the condition @xmath146 is usually not satisfied near melting on another ( making situa-    = 2.2 in    figure 2 .",
    "pair distribution function @xmath141 of equation ( [ mod - g0 ] ) for @xmath147 and @xmath276 ( upper curve ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the pair correlation function of equation ( [ pair - distr - func ] ) , ( lower curve ) .",
    "tions where cm positions of different flux lines are very close to each other rather frequent ) , the cm distribution function does _ not _ have to be very small ( @xmath277 ) for @xmath274 .",
    "however , because of the repulsion between flux lines , we can not _ completely _ neglect correlations between the center of mass positions and simply take @xmath278 for @xmath279 , in which case we would recover a fully entangled line liquid with the correlations ( [ correlator])-([area ] ) .",
    "since there is obviously no easy way to derive an analytic expression for the pair distribution function @xmath141 , we here are bound to speculate about its possible shape using our physical intuition and infer the resulting physics .",
    "one possible shape for @xmath141 which allows for close encounters between the centers of mass of different flux lines is the one shown in figure 2 , and corresponds to the approximation @xmath280 where @xmath281 is a numerical constant such that @xmath282 ( in figure 2 , we use @xmath283 ) .",
    "such a form of @xmath141 would yield a confining mass which is @xmath281 times smaller than the one found previously , equation ( [ resultmu ] ) , and would therefore lead to values of the average projected area @xmath29 @xmath284 which are much larger than the square of the average distance @xmath19 between flux lines .",
    "on the other hand , equation ( [ mod - g0 ] ) would lead to a relative displacement @xmath202 ^ 2\\rangle \\simeq \\frac{d_\\perp k_bt a}{\\eta\\sqrt{\\pi}\\varepsilon\\varepsilon_0 } \\big(1-\\mbox{e}^{-\\frac{\\eta\\sqrt\\pi}{\\varepsilon a}\\,|z - z'|}\\big ) \\label{gen - conf - corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath285 there will be a substantial range of separations @xmath286 where the _ rhs  _ of equation ( [ gen - conf - corr ] ) can very well be approximated by @xmath202 ^ 2\\rangle \\simeq   \\frac{d_\\perp k_bt}{\\varepsilon^2\\varepsilon_0}\\;|z - z'|\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( note that factors of @xmath281 have cancelled each other in this last equation ) and for which density correlations @xmath287 will decrease exponentially as a function of @xmath217 , leading to the structure factor @xmath288 note , in particular that for moderately anisotropic superconductors , and if @xmath285 , the length @xmath289 can be quite large , maybe even larger than the relatively small thicknesses used in numerical simulations , giving the _ semblance _ that the entangled state is characterized by the correlations ( [ correlator])-([area ] ) with an entanglement correlation length @xmath290 on the other hand , for values of @xmath281 close to unity ( @xmath291 ) , we recover a flux line liquid where correlations extend over much longer distances , which corresponds to the situation analyzed by righi et _ al._@xcite . we thus see that our model can describe , depending on what @xmath141 in reality is , very different situations corresponding to nearly disentangled ( @xmath291 ) , weakly entangled ( @xmath285 ) or fully entangled ( @xmath292 , @xmath278 ) flux line liquids .",
    "to summarize , in this paper , using a perturbative expansion of the hamiltonian of interacting flux lines in a vortex liquid similar to the expansion of the action of a quantum particle around a classical path@xcite , we have constructed a mean field theory of the flux line liquid which , in the author s opinion , has a better handling of the internal fluctuations of flux lines , and which , through the use of a nontrivial pair distribution function @xmath141 for the positions of the centers of mass of flux lines , goes beyond gaussian hydrodynamics , making contact with the standard liquid state theory of classical fluids . within our approach",
    ", we find that a weakly entangled phase might exist , where the average width of flux lines @xmath0 can be much larger than the average intervortex distance @xmath19 , but does not diverge with the sample thickness @xmath1 . by varying the shape of @xmath141 , we are able to describe situations with very short and rather large entanglement correlation lengths",
    ". since the slightest deviation of the cm pair distribution function from unity at small distances ( @xmath274 ) will necessarily lead to a finite ( nonzero ) confining mass @xmath124 , a _",
    "careful _ measurement of @xmath141 , for example in numerical simulations , would provide an unequivocal way of verifying the predictions of this paper , and to ascertain whether a fully entangled liquid phase with correlations ( [ correlator])-([area ] ) or the weakly entangled phase proposed here is the correct ground state of the flux line liquid .",
