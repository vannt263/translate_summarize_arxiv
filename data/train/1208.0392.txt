    "it is widely believed that all the dark matter particles ( hereafter dmps ) , which a terrestrial observer can detect , belong to the milky way galaxy .",
    "the main aim of this letter is to dispute this assertion and to show that a remarkable fraction of dark matter particles detected on the earth does not probably belong to our galaxy .",
    "although their density is relatively small , as compared with the total dark matter density , their impact into the direct detection signal may even dominate because of high speeds of the particles .    according to the modern cosmological notion ,",
    "the haloes of giant galaxies , like milky way or andromeda , are regions of local dark matter overdensity , rather than isolated islands . indeed , the local group , along with the haloes of large and dwarf galaxies , contains a significant fraction of dark matter that is not bound in the galaxies and presumably forms a large envelope of the local group @xcite . a significant part of the dark matter of the virgo supercluster is also not localized in haloes and probably distributed more or less homogeneously over all the volume of the supercluster @xcite .",
    "some part of this diffuse dark matter ( preeminently from the local group envelope ) penetrates into the central region of our galaxy and gives a contribution to the direct detection signal , which can even dominate under certain conditions : as we will see , the density fraction of the extragalactic dark matter is relatively small ( @xmath4 ) , however its particles should have extremely high speeds , close to the escape velocity ( @xmath1  km / s ) or even higher .",
    "it sets off the extragalactic particles from the halo dmps with much lower average speed .",
    "the direct detection signal produced by this component should also have some other characteristic features that will be discussed below .",
    "unfortunately , the total mass , distribution and dynamical properties of the extragalactic dark matter environment are now poorly known .",
    "therefore , we have to do with rough estimates of its content near the solar system .",
    "the local group consists of two very massive galaxies ( milky way and andromeda galaxy m31 ) , less massive triangulum galaxy m33 , and a host of dwarf galaxies .",
    "it seems reasonable to say that the local group contains a massive diffused dark matter component as well @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , some parameters of the system have not been measured with the adequate accuracy .",
    "we accept the following values in this letter : the radius of the solar system orbit @xmath5  kpc , the milky way mass @xmath6 , the andromeda galaxy mass @xmath7 , the distance between them @xmath8  kpc @xcite .",
    "the tangential components of the velocities of even some massive members of the local group are also not quite explored , and we know almost nothing about the distribution and dynamical parameters of the diffused component : so the investigation of its motion in the complex gravitational field of several bodies is quite a difficult and underdefined task .",
    "however , our aim is much simpler : we would like to model just the process of the envelope dark matter penetration towards the solar system . taking into account all the above - mentioned uncertainties , we will try to construct a simple toy model , that does not claim to describe all properties of the local group , allowing us , however , to estimate the density and the velocity distribution of the extragalactic dark matter near the solar system .",
    "let us consider the following model : the system is stationary and spherically - symmetric .",
    "specific angular momentum @xmath9 $ ] and maximum radius @xmath10 the particle moves from the centre remain constant for each particle in such a system , and gravitational potential @xmath11 depends only on @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath10 of the particles belonging to the envelope lie in some interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we accept @xmath14  kpc , which approximately corresponds to the size of the milky way roche lobe in system milky way - m31 , @xmath15  kpc , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "the particles have some distribution @xmath16 over @xmath10 inside @xmath13 $ ] ; we assume that their specific angular momentum @xmath9 $ ] has gaussian distribution .",
    "so the overall distribution ( i.e. the mass @xmath17 of particles in some interval @xmath18 ) is : @xmath19\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is , generally speaking , a function of @xmath10 .",
    "we accept the envelope mass @xmath21 .",
    "this value is noticeably smaller than the total mass of the diffused component , which is estimated as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we allow for , however , that the main part of this substance surrounds and accretes on the andromeda galaxy , and take only @xmath23 of the total mass , so we assume that the mass should be divided proportionally to the roche lobe areas of the components .    at first glance",
    "it would seem that the above - stated model is completely unusable to describe the dark matter motion in the local group : the gravitational field of the system by no means can be considered as central on the scale @xmath1  kpc , because of huge perturbations from other group members , especially from the andromeda galaxy .",
    "however , we are only interested in the envelope dark matter penetration towards the solar system , and this process is totally defined by the angular momenta of the particles : only the particles with very small momenta can reach the earth .",
    "the motion of the particles near the solar system is almost unaffected by m31 ( @xmath24 ) and may well be described by the above - mentioned model .",
    "when a particle moves from the envelope to the earth , its angular momentum is , of course , strongly influenced by the tidal perturbations .",
    "however , we almost do not know the momentum distribution of the particles in the envelope . therefore equation ( [ 14a1 ] ) may be thought of as describing the resultant distribution of the falling particles with regard to the perturbations from the other members of the local group .",
    "moreover , as we will see , the shape of angular momentum distribution is not very important : we actually use only the value at @xmath25 . as for perturbations of the particle energy , they are of the order of @xmath26 , i.e. always small .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the main part of the particle acceleration takes place deep in the milky way , where the gravitational field is much stronger .",
    "= -1    now we should find the particle distribution inside radius @xmath27 .",
    "a very similar task has been studied extensively in @xcite .",
    "we cite here only the results adaptable to our work , skipping the complete derivation .",
    "the exact distribution inside @xmath27 depends on @xmath12 and is equal to : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the half - period of a particle with maximal radius @xmath10 and specific angular momentum @xmath30 , i.e. the time it takes for the particle to fall from its maximal radius to the minimal one , and @xmath31 is the maximum angular momentum of a particle wherewith it can reach radius @xmath12 @xmath32 our concern is only with the particle distribution at @xmath33 . since @xmath34 , we can simplify the above equations @xmath35 @xmath36 here we took into account that for @xmath37 $ ] period @xmath29 is almost independent on @xmath30 ( @xmath38 , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "equation ( [ 14a5 ] ) can be significantly simplified , if we take into account that @xmath39 is physically constrained . on the one hand ,",
    "@xmath40 hardly can be higher , than @xmath41 since in the opposite case a significant fraction of the particles would have the speed above the escape velocity at this radius . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show that the root - mean - square angular momentum of the particles should be quite high and close to upper limit ( [ 14a7 ] ) .",
    "though there is rather strong evidence that @xmath20 of the particles of our galaxy is much lower @xcite , we will use value ( [ 14a7 ] ) in our calculations , since the density of the extragalactic dark matter grows with decreasing of @xmath20 , and we take the maximum possible value in order to obtain a conservative estimate .",
    "the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath10 is not well known , and we will presume it to be power - law @xmath42 however , we only need much softer condition @xmath43 to simplify ( [ 14a5 ] ) .",
    "it means that the tangential velocity dispersion in the envelope is supposed to be higher than @xmath44  km / s .",
    "such an assumption seems quite natural .",
    "if @xmath43 , we can simplify ( [ 14a5 ] ) as    @xmath45    now we should ascertain the velocity distribution of the particles .",
    "let us denote the tangential and radial components , and the total velocity of a particle at @xmath46 by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "we can use @xmath47 and @xmath49 instead of @xmath10 , @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "let us consider the particles with the same @xmath49 ( i.e. , with the same @xmath10 ) and find their angular distribution .",
    "an element @xmath53 of the solid angle in the phase space is equal to @xmath54 substituting this equation to ( [ 14a9 ] ) , we obtain @xmath55 as we can see , the particle distribution depends only on @xmath10 ( i.e. , on velocity magnitude @xmath49 ) , and is independent on the direction .",
    "so the distribution is isotropic . @xmath49 and @xmath10 are bound by a one - to - one relation @xmath56 we can substitute this equation to ( [ 14a11 ] ) and take into account that @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 hence the velocity distribution of the dark matter from the envelope is isotropic near the solar system ; equations ( [ 14a12 ] ) and ( [ 14a13 ] ) totally define its density and momentum distribution .    in order to complete the solution",
    ", we should define functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume @xmath16 to be a power - law function with some index @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 , @xmath63 we accept the mass distribution at @xmath64 to be @xmath65 this equation is not quite true , because in fact the particles contribute as well to the mass inside @xmath27 .",
    "however , our calculation is estimative , and we may disregard rather a small deviations from ( [ 14a15 ] ) . with the same accuracy @xmath60 may be thought of as a power - law function .",
    "one can readily see that @xmath66 if @xmath67 . though the mass distribution is not quite power - law in our case , we presume @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which is slightly more , than the time necessary for a body to fall on point mass @xmath70 from @xmath71  kpc with no initial velocity .",
    "function @xmath72 is totally defined by ( [ 14a12 ] ) .",
    "@xmath73\\ ] ] as for function @xmath74 , it remains almost constant for @xmath75 $ ] owing to the smallness of @xmath76 as compared with @xmath77 .",
    "therefore we can approximate @xmath78 .",
    "hereafter we accept @xmath79  km / s .",
    "the velocities of all the particles lie in a very narrow interval @xmath80 @xmath81 now we should substitute equations ( [ 14a8 ] ) , ( [ 14a16 ] ) , ( [ 14a14 ] ) for @xmath39 , @xmath60 , @xmath16 respectively and ( [ 14a7 ] ) for @xmath40 into equation ( [ 14a13 ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath82 .",
    "after some trivial calculations we obtain @xmath83 the shape of velocity distribution function @xmath84 in the phase space is given by @xmath85 where we should substitute @xmath10 by @xmath86 $ ] with the help of equations ( [ 14a14 ] ) and ( [ 14a17 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ 14a19 ] ) , ( [ 14a20 ] ) completely determine the solution of the task .",
    "not much is known about the dark matter distribution in the envelope . on the other hand , as we can see from equation ( [ 14a19 ] ) , the result is not strongly dependent on the choice of @xmath87 and @xmath61 ( as a consequence of the relative smallness of ratio @xmath88 ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to choose @xmath87 and @xmath61 by analogy with the well - known isothermal halo solution ( @xmath89 and the maxwell dmp velocity distribution with a temperature , constant over the halo ) , which corresponds to @xmath90 , @xmath91 . substituting these values in combination with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 to ( [ 14a19 ] )",
    ", we obtain the density of the extragalactic dark matter near the earth @xmath95  gev/@xmath96 .",
    "the speed distribution is notably narrow : the absolute values of all particles fall within @xmath97  km / s .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this feature is a consequence of the smallness of @xmath76 as compared with @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , two properties of the velocity distribution are model - independent : the speeds of extragalactic dmps from the envelope lie in a narrow range , and their angular distribution is isotropic .",
    "the density of the extragalactic dark matter turns out to be fairly high : @xmath99  gev/@xmath96 is more than @xmath100% of the total dark matter density near the earth @xmath101",
    "gev/@xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this brings up a question : how reliable is the estimation ?",
    "above we have already discussed the approximation of the system by a spherically symmetric model and found it acceptable .",
    "the premise that @xmath16 terminates abruptly at @xmath27 and @xmath102 is also unphysical .",
    "undoubtedly , our result is assessed ; however , it can not be called optimistic . indeed , as the dimensional method shows , for any envelope model the density of the extragalactic dark matter is , with an accuracy of a numerical factor , equal to @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the average values of the respective quantities .",
    "our calculations confirm this dependence : it can be easily obtained from ( [ 14a13 ] ) .",
    "@xmath106 is almost independent on the model choice .",
    "@xmath105 is essentially defined by the size of the milky way roche lobe , and thus is also more or less model - independent .",
    "the main source of the uncertainty is envelope mass @xmath107 .",
    "we proceed from the assumption of @xcite that @xmath107 is approximately equal to the masses of the galaxies of the local group .",
    "we used the highest possible value ( [ 14a7 ] ) for @xmath20 : if @xmath20 was higher , a significant part of the envelope would rapidly evaporate .",
    "since @xmath108 , this choice is conservative .",
    "thus there are two possible situations , when ( [ 14a19 ] ) significantly overestimates the density of the extragalactic dark matter .",
    "it may be so , if the envelope mass is in fact much lower than the masses of the local group member galaxies .",
    "the strong overestimation may also appear , if the angular momentum distribution of the envelope dmps differs greatly from the gaussian ( [ 14a1 ] ) , i.e. , almost all the particles have circular orbits .",
    "such a supposition seems highly improbable .",
    "first of all , it is in sharp contrast to n - body simulation results @xcite .",
    "there is also a good indirect counterargument : the largest local group member m31 has quite low angular momentum and , consequently , very oblong orbit @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that milky way and m31 will finally experience a central collision .",
    "thus the presence in the diffuse component of the local group of a bulk of dark matter particles that have very oblong orbits and can reach the earth seems quite possible .",
    "the @xmath109 extragalactic component of the total dark matter density can be especially important for the direct dark matter search .",
    "the direct search is based on the detection of the collisions of dark matter particles with nuclei of the target .",
    "the signal is sensitive to the velocity distribution : roughly speaking @xcite , it is proportional to @xmath110 here @xmath111 is the distribution in the earth s frame of reference : it should be obtained from ( [ 14a20 ] ) , ( [ 14a23 ] ) , or ( [ 14a24 ] ) by a galilean transformation .",
    "@xmath112 is the minimal dmp speed , to which the detector is sensitive ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the dmp and the detector nucleus mass respectively , @xmath116 is the detector activation energy , depending on its construction . in order to estimate the influence of the extragalactic dark matter to the direct detection signal",
    ", we should define a model for the velocity distribution of the galactic component .",
    "the maxwell distribution is now routinely used , mainly because of its simplicity : @xmath117 @xmath118 is the orbital speed of the solar system .",
    "there are strong reasons to suppose , however , that the distribution of the galactic dmps is strongly anisotropic and looks like @xmath119 where @xmath120 $ ] , @xmath121  km / s , @xmath122  km / s , @xmath48 and @xmath47 are radial and tangential components of the particle velocity , respectively @xcite .",
    "we calculated the signal produced by mixture of @xmath123  gev/@xmath96 of the extragalactic dark matter and @xmath124  gev/@xmath96 of the galactic one and divided it by the signal produced by the pure galactic dark matter with the same total density ( @xmath125  gev/@xmath96 ) .",
    "we used both models of the galactic dmp distribution : maxwell ( [ 14a23 ] ) and anisotropic ( [ 14a24 ] ) .",
    "the two ratios are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by the solid line ( maxwell velocity distribution of the galactic dark matter particles ) and by the dashed line ( anisotropic velocity distribution ) .",
    "one can see that the signal is scarcely affected by the presence of the extragalactic component , if @xmath126  km / s . however , the situation drastically changes for higher @xmath127 ; if @xmath127 is larger , than @xmath128  km / s , the extragalactic signal dominates .",
    "this is not particularly surprising : all the extragalactic particles are faster than @xmath129  km / s , while the number of the galactic particles rapidly drops above @xmath130  km / s .",
    "hence the impact of the extragalactic dark matter to the direct detection signal can be very important , especially if the dmp mass @xmath131 is small .",
    "indeed , if @xmath131 is small , @xmath127 is high ( [ 14a22 ] ) , i.e. , we can detect only the fastest dmps .",
    "for instance , dama collaboration reports @xcite about the detection of a signal produced by @xmath132  gev weakly interacting massive particles .",
    "we shall not discuss here the question of the nature of the signal ( other detectors do not confirm the result @xcite ) .",
    "it should be recorded , however , that @xmath133  km / s for the majority of detectors , if the dmp is so light , i.e. , the extragalactic component signal should totally dominate .    notice that we should , strictly speaking , have cut distributions ( [ 14a23 ] ) and ( [ 14a24 ] ) at @xmath134 .",
    "however , the fraction of the particles with @xmath135 is negligible for both the distributions , and the cutting would hardly affect the result ; the impact of the extragalactic component would be even slightly higher .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us briefly consider the extragalactic dark matter that does not belong to the local group .",
    "as recent astronomical observations imply @xcite , the dark matter of the virgo supercluster , in addition to galaxies and their groups , forms a large diffuse component .",
    "we do not know its velocity and space distributions , but it seems reasonable to assume that the dark matter is distributed more or less uniformly , and the velocity dispersion of the dmps is comparable with that of the observable members of the supercluster ( @xmath136  km / s ) .",
    "the measurements estimate the average density of the diffuse component as @xmath137  gev/@xmath96 .",
    "the gravitational field of the local group should increase this quantity near the earth .",
    "however , we can roughly estimate the enhancement as @xmath138 , where @xmath139  km / s is the escape velocity from the solar system orbit @xcite .",
    "thus the density of the supercluster dark matter is approximately @xmath140 times higher near the solar system , but yet hardly exceeds @xmath141  gev/@xmath96 .",
    "this value is so low , that it may scarcely be of interest for modern experiments . on the other hand , the supercluster dmps are particularly energetic ( @xmath142  km / s ) and hence may give a very characteristic signal .",
    "\\2 ) the particle speeds are @xmath1  km / s , i.e. they are much faster than the galactic dmps .",
    "the particles have isotropic velocity distribution ( perhaps , in contrast to the galactic dark matter ) ; their speed distribution is very narrow ( @xmath144  km / s ) .",
    "\\3 ) the extragalactic dark matter should give a significant contribution to the direct detection signal .",
    "if the detector is sensitive only to the fast particles ( @xmath145  km / s ) , the signal may even dominate .",
    "\\4 ) the density of other types of the extragalactic dark matter ( for instance , of the dmps forming the diffuse component of the virgo supercluster ) should be relatively small and comparable with the average dark matter density of the universe .",
    "however , these particles can generate anomaly high - energy collisions in direct dark matter detectors ."
