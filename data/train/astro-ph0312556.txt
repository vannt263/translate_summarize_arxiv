    "1987 ) ; the so - called alignment effect .",
    "indeed , many high-@xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) prgs ( hzprgs ) show the alignment effect , and its origin has been in debate in this decade ( e.g. , mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "various models have been proposed to explain the alignment effect ; e.g. , ( 1 ) scattering of the anisotropic radiation from a central engine of active galactic nuclei ( agn : e.g. , di serego alighieri et al .",
    "1989 ; fabian 1989 ; cimatti et al . 1998 ) , ( 2 ) the jet - induced star formation ( e.g. , chambers et al . 1987 ; mccarthy et al . 1987 ) , and ( 3 ) the jet - induced shock heating ( e.g. , de breuck et al . 2000 ) . in these models , agns play some important roles to create an extended aligned continuum emission at various wavelengths .",
    "the nebula contribution to the extended uv continua is also suggested in some prgs ( e.g. , dickson et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "an alternative idea , a pair of elongated bubbles or bi - directional cones associated with the superwind / starburst activity of the host galaxy , is proposed to explain a figure-8 shaped extended nebula in another radio galaxy , mrc 0406 - 244 , at @xmath12 ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2001 ; see also rush et al .",
    "1997 ; pentericci et al .",
    "although the radio - jet activity and the starburst / superwind activity are different physical processes and their timescales are also significantly different , the alignment effect can be understood in the following way ( taniguchi et al .",
    "the superwind could blow as a bipolar wind , which is often observed in many superwind galaxies in the local universe ( see heckman et al .",
    "1990 ) , since it is likely that the gas in the host galaxy is distributed with a disk - like configuration even for a young host galaxy of hzprgs .",
    "the radio jet is also expelled to the two directions perpendicular to the accretion plasma disk . therefore , we can explain the alignment effect if the accretion disk is nearly co - planer to the host gas disk .",
    "since some of these objects are known to experience vigorous star formation activity ( e.g. , dey et al . 1997 ) , this new mechanism can be regarded as one of possible ideas .",
    "study of such superwind nebulae in high-@xmath9 universe seems very useful to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies from a general point of view .",
    "the reason for this is that galaxies are expected to experience the galactic wind ( i.e. , the powerful initial superwind in a late phase of the galaxy formation ) , which is considered to play significant roles to determine global characteristics of the present - day massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) . since we know many hzprgs even at redshift @xmath13 3 ( e.g. , rttgering 1997 ; van ojik et al .",

    "2000 ) .    in this paper , we focus our attention to one of hzprgs , 1243 + 036 (= 4c+03.24 ) , at @xmath14 , which has the aligned ly@xmath0 nebula , and is one of the highest-@xmath9 objects known to show an alignment effect ( see , e.g. , chambers et al . 1990 ; lacy et al . 1994 ) .",
    "this object was identified as a hzprg during the course of spectroscopic survey of ultra steep spectrum sources conducted at eso ( rttgering 1994 , 1995 , 1997 ; van ojik et al .",
    "its detailed follow - up observations were made by van ojik et al .",
    "( 1996 ; hereafter vo96 ) . according to vo96 , the observational properties of the nebula are very complex in morphology and kinematics , and can be summarized as follows km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and a deceleration parameter of @xmath15 for consistency with the previous study of vo96 . with these cosmological parameters , 1",
    "arcsecond corresponds to 6.8 kpc at a distance of 1243 + 036 . ] .",
    "( a ) this object is surrounded by a huge ly@xmath0 halo which extends over 135 kpc .",
    "( b ) its ly@xmath0 luminosity amounts to @xmath16(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath17 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "( c ) its morphology shows the alignment effect .",
    "( d ) its kinematical properties show the presence of the following two components ; i ) the high - velocity width component with fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) @xmath18 1500 km s@xmath4 at @xmath19 km s@xmath4 ( blueshifted ) , and ii ) the halo component with fwhm @xmath18 250 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the halo component extends over 135 kpc with an average velocity gradient of @xmath18 450 km s@xmath4/135 kpc .",
    "in addition , recent high - resolution images of @xmath20-band , @xmath21-band , and narrow - band near 2.3@xmath22 m ( corresponding to the rest - frame uv - optical continua and redshifted [ oiii]4959 , 5007   emission line , respectively ) have revealed closely - aligned continuum and line emission along the narrow channel of the radio jet ( van breugel et al .",
    "1998 ; pentericci et al .",
    "although the close spatial coincidence between the uv / optical and radio emission strongly suggests a possibility of the radio jet - induced alignment component in this object , the fan- or cone - like appearance of the ly@xmath0 nebula seems to indicate the presence of another nebula component within the same object .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate this object in more detail and to explore its origin unambiguously .",
    "observation was made with the faint object camera and spectrograph , focas ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2002 ) , attached at the cassegrain focus of the subaru telescope ( kaifu 1998 ) on april 22 , 2002 ( ut ) to study the ly@xmath0 nebula around 1243 + 036 .",
    "the sky condition was clear and the seeing size ( fwhm ) was 0.6 .",
    "a 300 second @xmath23-band image , which includes the redshifted ly@xmath0 emission at @xmath24 , was obtained without ccd binning ( 0.1   per pixel ) just before the spectroscopic observation for target acquisition purpose .",
    "then , a 0.8   long slit was placed on the peak of the @xmath23-band image at a position angle ( pa ) of 152@xmath25 .",
    "the slit positioning accuracy was estimated to be about 0.5   due to the faintness of the target .",
    "@xmath26 pixel@xmath27 ccd binning was applied at the time of spectroscopy , and a single 1800 sec exposure was taken to give a spectrum covering from 4700   to 9400   with the combination of both the medium - dispersion grism ( 300b ) with 300 grooves mm@xmath4 and the order sorting filter ( y47 ) .",
    "the resultant resolution was 0.3   in space and 2.81   in wavelength per pixel corresponding 150 km s@xmath4 at the redshifted ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "the data reduction was made by using both the idl - based focas data reduction software ( yoshida et al .",
    "2000 ) and the iraf in a standard way ( overscan subtraction , bias subtraction , and flat fielding by using the dome flat images ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration was made by using sky emission lines , and could be done with high accuracy ( @xmath28 ) because the redshifted ly@xmath0 emission is very close to the strong [ o i ] sky emission at 5577 .",
    "we show our @xmath23-band image overlaid on the continuum image taken with a f702w filter of hst ( pentericci et al .",
    "1999 ) in figure 1 .",
    "the @xmath23-band image is smoothed by gaussian convolution to enhance the weak emission at outer parts of the nebula ; the effective seeing ( after the smoothing ) is 1.1   fwhm .",
    "the total magnitude of the nebula is @xmath29 .",
    "it is clearly shown that our @xmath23-band image reveals widely extended nebula component , showing remarkable contrast with the continuum emission , which is tightly aligned to the narrow radio jet ( vo96 ; pentericci et al .",
    "note also that the @xmath23-band image appears very similar to the ly@xmath0 image taken with a narrow - band filter ( vo96 ) and thus our @xmath23-band imaging traces the ly@xmath0 mostly .",
    "however , there is a notable difference between the two at northwest ( nw ) of the nucleus : although the ly@xmath0 image shows an extended ly@xmath0 emission only toward southeast ( se ) of the nucleus , our @xmath23-band image shows an extended nebula toward both nw and se of the nucleus .",
    "since our @xmath23-band filter bandpass covers the whole redshifted ly@xmath0 emission , and the contribution of the continuum emission should be almost negligible for the extended component judging from both the prominent nuclear source and weak emission extended along the jet ( vo96 ; van breugel et al .",
    "1998 ; pentericci et al .",
    "1999 ) , our @xmath23-band image and the ly@xmath0 image of vo96 should reveal the gaseous nebula in a similar way .",
    "therefore this apparent discrepancy in two images needs an explanation .",
    "our ly@xmath0 spectrogram is shown in figure 2 along with the slit position overlaid on our @xmath23-band image .",
    "the spectrogram is also smoothed by 4 by 4 binned - pixel running averaging to enhance the outer weak emission .",
    "after the smoothing , the effective resolution is 1.2   in space , which is almost comparable to that of the smoothed imaging data .",
    "the velocity resolution is 600 km s@xmath4 . in order to check the consistency quantitatively between the spectrogram and the @xmath23-band image",
    ", we made an one - dimensional plot of the spatial ly@xmath0 flux distribution by integrating the @xmath23-band flux over an expected slit position along the slit width directions ( figure 2b ) .",
    "a similar plot was also made from the spectroscopic data by integrating the flux on the spectrogram along the wavelength direction at each spatial position ( figure 2d ) .",
    "these two plots look very similar to each other ; i.e. , both show not only an asymmetric distribution toward se but also a diffuse extension toward nw at a fainter flux level .",
    "this suggests not only that our spectroscopy and imaging data are consistent with each other ( i.e. , the spatial orientation of the spectrogram is right , and the slit was placed at the expected position at the center of the nebula ) , but also that the nw nebula does exist .",
    "it seems noteworthy that the nw component is blueshifted at 5541   or bluer for the most part ( figure 2c ) .",
    "such a blueshifted component could not be detected by vo96 due to rather narrow wavelength coverage of their narrow - band filter ( 5541   ",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is a pair of elongated nebulae along nw and se directions around 1243 + 036 .",
    "our ly@xmath0 spectrogram ( figure 2c ) reveals complicated structures of the nebula both in space and in velocity .",
    "we group the nebula into the following four components : ( i ) the compact nucleus component , ( ii ) the extended near - systemic component at both sides of the nucleus , ( iii ) the redshifted component aside the nucleus , and ( iv ) the extended blue components at both sides of the nucleus .",
    "we give below a summary of their observational properties and their comparisons with results of vo96 , who conducted similar long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "note that , although the slit position ( centered on the nebula ) and its orientation ( pa=152@xmath25 ) are the same for the two , the slit widths ( 2.5   for vo96 and 0.8   for us ) and the velocity resolutions ( 150 km s@xmath4 for vo96 and @xmath30 km s@xmath4 for us ) are different .",
    "\\(i ) the component at @xmath31   around the peak of the ly@xmath0 emission shows an evident blue - asymmetric profile with its peak at 5560  , being consistent with the report by vo96 ( at 5557  ) .",
    "its intensity peak corresponds spatially to that of the rest uv - optical continuum emission with which the radio core showing flatter spectrum is associated ( vo96 ; van breugel et al .",
    "1998 ; pentericci et al .",
    "therefore , we attribute this component to the nucleus component . the blue wing emission can be traced down to @xmath6 km s@xmath4 in the rest frame of the galaxy ( hereafter all velocities are shown with respect to the systemic velocity in the rest frame of the galaxy ) although a part of the wing may be contaminated by the off - nucleus blue components at both sides of the nucleus ( see below ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the extended component whose velocity is close to the systemic one is found at both sides of the nucleus , and can be traced out to @xmath32 ( 4 - 5 )   from the nucleus .",
    "it shows no strong velocity shear across the extension ( @xmath33 km s@xmath4 ) although the sky emission at 5577   might affect the measurement of its velocity curve given our lower velocity resolution .",
    "the velocity width is narrower than the nucleus component across the extension since we could not resolved the width by our instrument resolution ( 600 km s@xmath4 fwhm ) .",
    "vo96 detected an `` outer halo '' component extending out to @xmath34   on both sides of the nucleus at almost systemic velocity .",
    "this component has a narrow line width ( @xmath35 km s@xmath4 fwhm ) and shows a large - scale velocity shear of as much as @xmath36 km s@xmath4 .",
    "although our spectroscopic resolution is not high enough to investigate such a velocity curve , our near - systemic component appears to correspond to the outer halo component of vo96 although we detect it only out to @xmath37 .",
    "\\(iii ) the redshifted component is detected at @xmath38   nw of the nucleus ,   se of the nucleus ( i.e. , another side of the nucleus ) in figure 11 of vo96 .",
    "] and is found at redward of the sky emission . due to the strong sky contamination , little information is available for this component .",
    "\\(iv ) the blueshifted component at se extends up to @xmath39   from the nucleus and shows strong blue - shifted velocity of @xmath40 km s@xmath4 . at the opposite side of the nucleus ( nw ) ,",
    "another blue component is detected which is much more extended ( @xmath41    @xmath42   from the nucleus ) and shows much wider velocity width ( @xmath7 km s@xmath4 fwhm corrected for the instrumental resolution ) .",
    "the velocity curve shows the bluest velocity of @xmath6 km s@xmath4 at @xmath18 2.5   nw , and the velocity slows down at outer regions ( @xmath40 km s@xmath4 at @xmath43   nw ) .",
    "vo96 has also detected blueshifted and extended component .",
    "note , however , that there might be a difference between their spectrogram and ours .",
    "we could not detect any compact emission - line component at @xmath44   nw from the nucleus ,- band image and spectrogram are consistent with each other in orientation , as shown in section 3.1 , and our @xmath23-band image and their narrow - band ly@xmath0 image ( their figure 9 ) are also consistent with each other in orientation , given the different wavelength coverage of the nebula ( as explained in section 3.1 ) , ensuring that our orientation is right .",
    "therefore , although vo96 claimed that this high - velocity component is found at se , its correct position is probably at the opposite side ( nw ) of the nucleus . in the following , we assume an image flip of the vo96 s spectrogram for the comparison . ]",
    "although vo96 claimed a presence of an enhanced ly@xmath0 emission there which shows blueshifted velocity of @xmath19 km s@xmath4 with a wider line width of @xmath45 km s@xmath4 fwhm .",
    "our spectrogram shows , on the other hand , a component which shows similar kinematical properties ( blueshifted by @xmath46 km s@xmath4 with an even wider line width of @xmath47 km s@xmath4 fwhm ) but is extended more smoothly over @xmath41 . this difference could be explained by the different slit coverage on the nebula between the two spectrograms , i.e. , our narrow slit ( @xmath48 of vo96 s ) could not cover a portion of the nebula where enhanced ly@xmath0 emission is present .",
    "if this is the case , the nebula might have complex sub - structures within a nebula .",
    "we discuss plausible origins of the alignment effect observed in 1243 + 036 .",
    "there are some pieces of evidence indicating that other mechanism than the radio - jet related one works to excite the extended nebula in 1243 + 036 .",
    "first , the previous high - resolution images of @xmath20-band , @xmath21-band , and narrow - band near 2.3@xmath22 m ( corresponding to the rest - frame uv - optical continua and redshifted [ oiii]4959 , 5007   emission line , respectively ) have revealed closely - aligned continuum and line emission along the narrow channel of the radio jet ( van breugel et al . 1998 ; pentericci et al . 1999 ) .",
    "although this indicates an importance of the radio jet activity to the alignment effect , the ly@xmath0 nebula of this galaxy is extended much more widely than the region of the aligned continuum ( figure 1 ) .",
    "second , the extended components are blueshifted at both side of the nucleus .",
    "the jet - induced extranuclear shock , if any , should show a pair of blueshifted and redshifted components at each side of the nucleus because the symmetric propagation of a pair of jet and its counter jet is expected , being inconsistent with the observation . therefore it seems very likely that the effect of the radio jet onto the extended nebula can not explain the excitation of the whole ly@xmath0 nebula .",
    "another idea of the origin of the widely extended ly@xmath0 nebula is the circumgalactic matter ionized by the anisotropic hard radiation from agn .",
    "if this is the case , the matter irradiated by the agn radiation is required to be distributed over a large scale ( @xmath49 kpc ) at a violent kinematical status to explain the velocity shift of @xmath40 km s@xmath4 together with a large velocity dispersion of 1000 - 2000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "one possibility may be that such violent gaseous systems are tidally - induced structures formed through a putative merger event . however , even nearby luminous mergers show an overall velocity differences of @xmath50 km s@xmath4 or less along the tidal tails ( e.g. , hibbard & yun 1999 ; mihos & bothun 1998 ) .",
    "also the wider velocity dispersion seems difficult to be reproduced along the tidal tail ( e.g. , hibbard & yun 1999 ; mihos & bothun 1998 ) .",
    "another candidate for the extended matter is the remaining sub - galactic clumps for the galaxy formation .",
    "however , the range of the clump velocity dispersion would be 300 km s@xmath4 or less because gaseous clumps with a higher velocity dispersion are difficult for them to assemble to form a galaxy .",
    "therefore this idea could not be simply applied for the case of 1243 + 036 .",
    "an alternative idea for the origin of the blue - shifted extended ly@xmath0 nebula is the shock - excited nebula associating with the superwind outflow .",
    "our @xmath23-band image reveals a pair of elongated bubbles or cone - like structures extending into opposite ways from the nucleus .",
    "similar extended nebulae are often seen around the starburst galaxies with the superwind / superbubble activity , such as m82 , ngc 3079 , and arp 220 ( e.g. , heckman et al . 1990 ) .",
    "also similar nebula is found around a high-@xmath9 ( @xmath12 ) radio galaxy mrc 0406 - 244 which shows a pair of shock - excited elongated bubbles associated with the superwind activity ( taniguchi et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "if 1243 + 036 is also the case , the projected velocity field of the nebula would show two components at different velocities each of which corresponds to either front or rear surface of the expanding bubble or outflowing cone ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1990 ) , rather than a single blueshifted component as observed . if the galaxy is surrounded by the dusty halo , which is often found around hzprgs ( van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ) , the redshifted emission from the rear surface of the bubble may be attenuated due to the longer path through the halo .",
    "it seems also possible that the strong sky contamination at just red side of the ly@xmath0 emission might make it very difficult to detect redshifted counterparts of the blueshifted extended components .",
    "therefore the blueshifted and extended components at both sides of the nucleus can be explained by the expanding bubble / outflowing cone model .",
    "the top of the expanding bubble , if not blown out to form conical outflow ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1990 ) , will show a single line - of - sight velocity .",
    "if the superbubble around 1243 + 036 expands almost within the sky plane , then the observed velocity would be blueshifted from the systemic velocity within the bubble , and it goes back closer to the systemic one at the tip .",
    "wider velocity width may be due to the kinematical disturbance at the shock front of the bubble .",
    "since the superwind / superbubble model can reproduce the observed morphological and kinematical properties of the nebula in qualitative ways , this model seems more plausible than the model of irradiated disturbed matter by agn .",
    "although we could not reject a possibility of the contribution of the agn excitation to the nebula , it seems very likely that the superwind activity still plays an important role to bring the disturbed material around the galaxy as observed .",
    "we apply a simple superwind model to the nebula around 1243 + 036 to see whether the observed size and the kinematical conditions can be reproduced quantitatively by the model .",
    "to estimate order - of - magnitude values of the nebula size and the expansion velocity , we apply a simple model of the evolution of a single spherical superbubble . the radius and the velocity of the expanding shell at time @xmath51 ( in units of 10@xmath52 yr ) in the model are @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mechanical luminosity released collectively from the supernovae in the central starburst in units of @xmath56 erg s@xmath4 , and @xmath57 is the average hydrogen number density of the inter galactic medium ( igm ) in units of @xmath58 @xmath59 ( mccray & snow 1979 ; koo & mckee 1992a , 1992b ; heckman et al . 1996 ) . since the host galaxy is luminous in blue in the rest - frame of the galaxy ( @xmath60 ; van breugel et al .",
    "1998 ) , it seems to be a massive elliptical galaxy with a mass @xmath61 .",
    "assuming an instantaneous burst of star formation of @xmath62 , the mechanical luminosity is estimated to @xmath63 erg s@xmath4 over a time scale of @xmath64 yrs ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) . and @xmath65 are proportional to just one fifth power of @xmath55 . ] the average hydrogen number density of the igm is estimated following taniguchi & shioya ( 2000 ) , and is @xmath66 at @xmath14 in the adopted cosmology . substituting all these values into the equations , we find @xmath67 kpc and @xmath68 km s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore both the observed size of the blueshifted extended nebula ( @xmath8 kpc in radius , corresponding to 4.5 ) and the maximum blueshift velocity ( @xmath6 km s@xmath4 ) can be roughly reproduced if we assume @xmath69 0.1  0.3 , which is comparable to the age of a nearby superwind nebula of arp 220 ( e.g. , heckman et al . 1996 ) . hence the superwind model can be applicable to the blueshifted extended nebula of 1243 + 036 in a quantitative way .",
    "we found an elongated giant nebula ( @xmath70 kpc ) with blueshifted ( @xmath19  @xmath6 km s@xmath4 ) and broad ( @xmath18 1000  1900 km s@xmath4 fwhm ) ly@xmath0 emission around a hzprg 1243 + 036 at @xmath14 .",
    "the nebula can be recognized as a pair of expanding elongated bubbles or outflowing bi - directional cones at both sides of the nucleus , being much similar to some prototypical superwind galaxies in local universe in both morphological and kinematical points of view .",
    "we show that the superwind model can be applicable to the nebula to explain the size and the kinematical properties of its bubble or cone - like structure .    in order to see such an evolved nebula associated with the superwind activity at @xmath14 ,",
    "the onset of the starburst should be at @xmath71 .",
    "the is because it takes several @xmath72 yrs for the superwind to blow out of the host galaxy since the onset of the burst ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) , and another a few @xmath73 yrs is required for the nebula to expand to the observed size .",
    "if this would be the case , it seems very likely that 1243 + 036 is in the phase of the galactic wind after the initial burst for the galaxy formation ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) ."
