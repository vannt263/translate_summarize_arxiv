    "the problem of capacity region of gaussian interference networks has been open for decades except for a few special cases @xcite . in the course of pursuit of capacity region of general gaussian interference networks",
    ", researchers have been led into approximating their capacity regions ( see for example , @xcite ) and their sum - capacities .",
    "a popular way of approximating the sum - capacity of a gaussian interference network is using the concept of degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the sum dof of a gaussian interference network is said to be @xmath4 if the sum - capacity can be written as @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "the sum dof of @xmath11 network was studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a sum dof of @xmath12 is achievable in a @xmath11 network while the work in @xcite shows that a sum dof of @xmath13 is achievable .",
    "furthermore , @xmath13 was also proven to be an outerbound on the sum dof of @xmath11 network @xcite . the transmission scheme in @xcite that achieved this sum dof",
    "was based on the idea of interference alignment ( ia ) .",
    "we shall henceforth call this scheme as the jafar - shamai scheme .",
    "the concept of ia for @xmath14 involved linear precoding using a @xmath15-symbol extension of the channel in such a way that the interference subspaces at the receivers overlap while being linearly independent of the desired signal subspace .",
    "this assumed constant channel matrices and knowledge of all the channel gains at both the transmitters ( i.e. , global csit ) .",
    "the desired signals were retrieved by simple zero - forcing .    in a recent work by li et al .",
    "@xcite an ia scheme for @xmath16 network using the alamouti code and appropriate channel dependent precoding was proposed . in this scheme ,",
    "each transmitter needs the knowledge of the channel from itself to both the receivers ( i.e. , local csit ) whereas , in the jafar - shamai scheme , global csit is needed .",
    "this scheme , which we call the ljj scheme , claimed to achieve the sum dof of @xmath16 network which is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "however , @xcite assumed the channel gains to be independently distributed as circularly symmetric complex gaussian .",
    "also , the proof of achievability of the sum dof of @xmath16 network is incomplete .",
    "we present a complete proof in section [ subsec2 ] of this paper with the assumption that the real and imaginary parts of the channel gains are distributed independently according to an arbitrary continuous distribution like in the jafar - shamai scheme .",
    "further , the ljj scheme also achieves a diversity gain of two with node - to - node symbol rate of @xmath17 complex symbols per channel use ( cspcu ) where , the complex symbols are assumed to take values from a fixed finite constellation .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the ljj scheme to @xmath18 network using srinath - rajan ( s - r ) space - time block code ( stbc ) which was proposed for the asymmetric @xmath19 single user mimo system @xcite .",
    "the s - r code possesses a repetitive alamouti structure upto scaling by a constant .",
    "this makes it convenient to adapt the ljj scheme to @xmath18 network .",
    "we prove that the proposed scheme achieves the sum dof of @xmath18 network which is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "this scheme also requires only local csit like the ljj scheme .",

    "the proposed scheme requires only local csit while the jafar - shamai scheme requires global csit to achieve the same sum dof .",
    "* we prove that the proposed scheme also achieves a diversity gain of at least four ( see theorem [ thm4 ] in section [ sec4 ] ) when fixed finite constellations are employed at the transmitters .",
