    "the pauli principle among identical fermions leads to an effective repulsion which avoids the collapse of the hadronic universe .",
    "a many - fermion system dominated by pauli repulsion exhibits universal behavior with the physical attraction playing a minor role .",
    "such universal behavior manifests in correlation and scaling in the observables of few- and many - fermion systems @xcite .",
    "this universality is prominent in the limit of zero fermi - fermi interaction in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of super - fluid ( sf ) fermions leading to universal properties of low - temperature superconductors @xcite , of cold neutron matter and neutron star @xcite , and of a trapped fermi sf @xcite at zero temperature .",
    "this universality also manifests at unitarity @xcite , when the atomic scattering length @xmath1 tends to infinity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "both at the bcs limit ( @xmath3 ) and unitarity , the scattering length ceases to be a scale of length , and the only length scale of the problem in these limits is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermi momentum .",
    "consequently , all energies are universal functions of fermi momentum @xmath5 ( or of fermi energy @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 is the atomic mass , and the system acquires universal behavior with robust scaling involving the stationary observables , such as energy , chemical potential , etc .",

    "the crossover from the weak - coupling bcs limit to unitarity @xcite has been an active area of research @xcite after the experimental realization @xcite of this crossover in a trapped dilute fermi sf by manipulating an external background magnetic field near a feshbach resonance .",
    "also , by modifying the bulk chemical potential term in the lda to one appropriate for the bcs - unitarity crossover , the above scalings can be extended to the full crossover .",
    "to study the universality along the crossover , we use a galilei - invariant df formulation of the trapped fermi sf @xcite , equivalent to a hydrodynamical model with the correct phase - velocity relation @xcite @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the sf velocity , and @xmath45 the phase of the order parameter at position @xmath46 : @xmath47\\sqrt{n({\\bf r})}=\\mu_0\\sqrt{n({\\bf r})},\\\\ \\label{2 } & & \\mu(n , a)=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(3\\pi^2n)^{2/3}g({n^{1/3}a}),\\\\ \\label{3 } \\label{gnew } & & g(x)=1+\\frac{(\\chi_1 x-\\chi_2 x^2)}{(1-\\beta_1 x+\\beta_2 x^2)},\\\\ & & \\mu = n\\int d { \\bf r}\\biggr[\\frac{\\hbar^2}{8m}|\\nabla \\sqrt{n}|^2+un + \\mu(n , a)n\\biggr],\\label{4}\\\\ & & e = n\\int d { \\bf r}\\biggr[\\frac{\\hbar^2}{8m}|\\nabla \\sqrt{n}|^2+un + \\int_0^n \\mu(n',a ) dn ' \\biggr],\\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are parameters .",
