    "the spectra of hadrons form an extremely important test ground for nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the scaling property of qcd tells us that in the end all characteristics of hadrons must depend on a single parameter , say @xmath1 or @xmath12 .",
    "till now , all calculations of hadronic spectra with an accuracy comparable to the uncertainties in the experimental data , have relied on models that contain several , in some cases even many , parameters .",
    "here we adopt the formalism that uses the qcd - string hamiltonian which relies on only one parameter  the string tension @xmath1 , while for light mesons the interactions derived from perturbative qcd , both static and spin - dependent , can be considered as a perturbation .",
    "the string tension can be extracted from experiment , in particular from the slope of the leading regge trajectory , and in the present paper we use it to describe the orbital excitations of light mesons .",

    "obtains a matrix multichannel hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "therefore the ground states of the mesons with not too large orbital momentum ( @xmath15 ) can be treated in the closed channel approximation .",
    "secondly , the relativistic hamiltonian @xmath13 used here is derived in the quenched approximation , where creation of @xmath16 pairs ( sea quarks ) is neglected .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation for low - lying states is expected to be approximately 10% @xcite , while high radial and orbital excitations can be strongly affected by @xmath16 pair creation@xcite .",
    "thirdly , to derive the hamiltonian @xmath17 only forward - in - time quark trajectories have been taken into account while backward trajectories of a quark ( antiquark ) were neglected .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation has been checked comparing meson spectra of the center - of - mass hamiltonian @xmath17 and light - cone hamiltonian @xmath18 , since in the latter case backward - in - time trajectories do not contribute @xcite .",
    "this comparison has shown that the differences in meson masses for these hamiltonians is not larger than 10% for all mesons with exception of the pion , which receives a large contribution from backward - in - time trajectories corresponding to negative energy components and for them the formalism should be modified . in the hamiltonian",

    "we use here the current quark mass @xmath78 and due to the procedure of canonical quantization the constituent mass of a quark can be defined in a rigorous way as the canonical coordinate @xmath44 which is equal to the quark kinetic energy .",
    "it is of interest to note that the final expression of the hamiltonian @xmath71 does not contain the constituent mass at all .",

    "the qcd coupling is @xmath93 which is typical for heavy quarkonia , and from our analysis of the meson spectra the following restriction on the strong coupling @xmath94 , is obtained .",

    "the experimental numbers for the spin - averaged masses @xmath95 , or the centers of gravity of the @xmath96-multiplet ( the ground states with @xmath97 ) , are presented in table [ tab.1.0 ] and need some remarks .    first , all members of the @xmath98 multiplet are supposed to be known : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and the @xmath101 too , are considered to form the @xmath102 multiplet with @xmath103 mev .",
