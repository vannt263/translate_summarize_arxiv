    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) has provided a large set of unique data to study the properties of astrophysics objects , such as galaxies , stars , quasars .",
    "many projects have been done or are ongoing on the basis of this large dataset .",
    "for example , about galaxies , besides the large number of typical studies , such as calculating the galaxy luminosity function ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) , studying the statistic properties of bright galaxies ( shimasaku et al .",
    "2001 ) , the color separation of galaxy types ( strateva et al . 2001 ) , the mass - metallicity relations and star - formation history of star - forming galaxies ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a , b ; brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ; tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) , the metallicity calibrations of star - forming galaxies ( liang et al . 2006 ; yin et al . 2007 ) , the color - magnitude relations of galaxies ( chang et al . 2006a , b ) etc . , especially , the sdss database is also very efficient to search for special interesting objects by taking advantage of the high - quality optical spectra and deep multi - bands photometric images ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ; kewley et al . 2007 ; zhang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we found two extragalactic h  ii regions from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ) database , which were classified as stars in the database .",
    "indeed , one of them , sdss j121811.0 + 465501.2 , is located in a galaxy which is identified as a new low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy by this study ( sect.[sec5 ] ) , and another one , sdss j135440.5 + 535309.6 , is located in the irregular lsb galaxy ugc8837 .",
    "the reasons they were classified as stars may be that their hosts are very faint with very low luminosities and low surface brightness , and they have very low redshifts .",
    "however , their sdss optical spectra show obvious emission lines , i.e. , strong [ o  iii]@xmath0@xmath04959 , 5007 , balmer emission - lines at low and high levels , but very weak [ n  ii]@xmath0@xmath06548,6583 and [ s  ii]@xmath0@xmath06317,6731 , which show that they could be metal - poor star - forming regions .",
    "these two objects must be very interesting to check the metallicities of lsb galaxies by taking advantage of the high quality spectral observations .",
    "lsb galaxies are galaxies that emit much less light per area than normal galaxies . because of their contrast with the night sky they are hard to find , and hence their contribution to the general galaxy population has long been underestimated .",
    "they are usually defined as objects with a blue central surface brightness @xmath4 significantly fainter than the freeman value of 21.65 mag arcsec@xmath5 ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "this threshold value of @xmath4 varies in the literature from @xmath1023.0 mag arcsec@xmath5 ( impey & bothun 1997 ) to @xmath1022.0 mag arcsec@xmath5 ( impey , burkholder & sprayberry 2001 ) .",
    "mcgaugh ( 1996 ) tried to quantify this as well .",
    "they described as an lsb any disc galaxy with @xmath4 @xmath11 22.75 mag arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "further quantitative distinctions were also suggested to avoid the pollution of excessive nomenclature , for example , the intermediate surface brightness ( isb ) with @xmath12@xmath4 @xmath13 22.75 between lsb and high surface brightness ( hsb ) , the very low surface brightness ( vlsb ) with @xmath14@xmath4 @xmath13 27 and so on .",
    "the detection of lsb galaxies is difficult owing to their intrinsically low global luminosities and their characteristic low surface brightness .",
    "a direct probe of the evolutionary state of lsb galaxies is the metal abundance in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "a low abundance generally indicates only limited enrichment of the ism and therefore ( in a closed system ) a small amount of evolution .",
    "the high - quality optical spectra from the sdss permit us to estimate the oxygen and nitrogen abundances from electron temperatures for these two objects .",

    "since [ o  ii]@xmath50 was shifted out of the observational band , the ionic abundance @xmath51/@xmath52 can not be obtained from direct measurements .",
    "however , it is reasonable to suppose that oxygen abundance is the same throughout the h  ii region , the fraction of that oxygen ionized singly or doubly depends on the physical conditions in the gas .",
    "the ratio of @xmath51 to @xmath34 ( and in principle , neutral o ) within the @xmath52 zone varies with the hardness of the ionizing spectrum , the gas density , and the o / h abundance itself . since there is no observed [ o  ii]@xmath50 to tell us what be measured , some guestimate is warranted .",

    "then the accuracy on the total o / h will be entirely dominated by the @xmath51/@xmath52 assumption .",
    "since this is a factor of two , a more reasonable uncertainty to quote on the total log(o / h ) would be about 0.30 dex .",
    "indeed , these h  ii regions are likely to be high ionization ( typical of low o / h regions ) , with low @xmath51/@xmath52 such that the assumed doubling is likely an over - estimate . but this assumption wo nt change the magnitude order of the oxygen abundance .",

    "the 2-d fitting deals with real galaxy images directly , and develops a projected model to approach real light distribution of galaxies , which can provide extra bulge / disc separation . performing light fitting in 2-d allows proper weighting of data points reflecting uncertainties due to photon statistics , flat fielding uncertainties , sky level uncertainties and model imperfection ( de jong et al .",

    "it has an exponential disc and almost no bulge . and",
    "it could be a true nearby dwarf galaxy with a scale length of 0.4kpc and @xmath75@xmath8713.51 , @xmath829.16mpc ( with @xmath18=70 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 ) .",

    "we obtain its oxygen abundance as 12+log(o / h)@xmath17.88 from electron temperature on the basis of the sdss optical spectrum .",
    "we also estimate the oxygen abundance of another h  ii region j135440.5 + 535309.6 located in the irregular lsb galaxy ugc8837 , which was found from the same procedure from sdss - dr4 occasionally as for the object j121811.0 + 465501.2 .",

    "these low metallicities confirm other studies for h  ii regions of lsbgs , in which they showed that the lsbgs have low metallicities .    in summary , in the edge - on disc lsb galaxy and the irregular lsb galaxy ugc8837 ,",
    "there are massive stars forming presently , but the metallicities there are very low .",
    "these could support the picture of quiescent and sporadic evolution , and the less efficient metal - enrichment of the lsbgs .",
    "these two extragalactic objects are among the list of 243  stars \" with special spectra , which were selected from the sdss - dr4 database in automatic recognition and classification on stellar spectra to search for emission - line stars .",
    "most are identified as emission - line stars , such as cv stars and others , but left some interesting objects as we studied here .",
