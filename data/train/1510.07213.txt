    "recent work has shown that during the cooling phase of the bursts , the relation between the bolometric flux and the temperature is significantly different from the canonical @xmath6 relation that is expected if the apparent emitting area on the surface of the ns remains constant as the flux decreases during the decay of the burst and if the spectrum is blackbody @xcite .",
    "this could be due to either changes in the emitting area of the ns , or to changes in the colour - correction factor , @xmath7 , which accounts for hardening of the spectrum arising from electron scattering in the ns atmosphere , among other factors @xcite .",
    "coherent oscillations during bursts have been detected in many ns - lmxbs ; these oscillations likely reflect the spin frequency of the ns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "they suggested that tail oscillations could be due to the spread of a cooling wake , which is formed by vortices during the cooling of the ns atmosphere @xcite . in this scenario , the speed of the cooling wake depends on the latitude at which the burst ignites , since the speed of the burning front near the equator is higher than that near the poles .",

    "if the bursts ignite at low latitude , during the decay time the front speed of the cooling wake is fast , the emission area , and hence the blackbody radius , changes fast , and the asymmetric emission is short lived .",
    "these bursts would not show oscillations and the blackbody radius evolves very fast .",
    "we note that this interpretation has not been calculated in detail .",
    "we also note that burst oscillations also appear in the rising phase of the bursts ( e.g. , left pannels of figure [ fig_spectrum_2 ] ) .",
    "the mechanism of burst oscillations might be different between the rising and decaying phase .",
    "the burst oscillations in the rising phase may be caused by asymmetries due to initially localized nuclear burning that later spreads over the surface of the ns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of changes of the @xmath7 in the ns atmosphere , the ns atmosphere model of @xcite suggests that @xmath7 should decrease as the flux decreases during the burst decay . in section [ colour factor ]",
    "we analysed the @xmath7 during the burst decay phase assuming a constant emitting ns surface .",
    "we found that in the early decay phase , the evolution of @xmath7 in the bursts without oscillations ( see the right panels of figure [ fig_flux_fc1 ] and [ fig_flux_fc2 ] ) can be qualitatively well - described by the atmosphere models of @xcite . on the other hand , bursts with oscillations always show a roughly constant @xmath7 , which disagrees with the atmosphere models .",
    "in particular , these are the hard state bursts that @xcite have pointed to as being more reliable for comparison to spectral models , and thus for use in mass - radius constraints .    in the bursts with oscillations , in order to produce asymmetric emission ,",
    "only part of the ns surface is burning , which contradicts the assumption in @xcite that the emission should come from the whole surface of the ns .",
    "4u 172834 is likely a ucxb @xcite , so all the bursts should ignite in a ns atmosphere with similar chemical composition and have similar curves in the @xmath41 flux diagram . in figure [ fig hist slope edd ]",
    "we show that bursts with a flat @xmath41flux relation appear preferentially in the soft state .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray spectrum in the burst decay can not be described by the model of @xcite when the source is in the soft state .",
    "@xcite suggested that in the soft state the small inner radius of the accretion disc and the high mass accretion rate can affect the emission from the ns atmosphere .",
    "our results indicate that the behaviour of @xmath7 in the bursts with oscillations in 4u 172834 can not be explained by the model of @xcite .",
    "the light curve profiles are also different between the bursts with and without oscillations in 4u 172834 . in the rise phase of the burst , the light curve of bursts with oscillations increases faster than in bursts without oscillations . around the peak of the burst ( e.g. within 50% of the peak flux ) the light curve of the bursts without oscillations",
    "show smooth and symmetric profiles ( see right panel of figure [ fig smooth ] ) , whereas , in bursts with oscillations the light curves show sharp and asymmetric profiles ( see left panel of figure [ fig smooth ] ) .",
    "the shape of the light curve during the rising phase also shows different behaviours in bursts with and without oscillations .",
    "the convexity takes only positive values in bursts without oscillations whereas it shows both positive and negative values in burst with oscillations .",
    "the shape , time scale and peak flux of the light curve of a burst can vary substantially depending on factors such as the igination latitude , rotation rate of the ns , the accretion rate and the composition of the accreted material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are no simple analytic models that take into account all of the relevant parameterst yet .",
    "@xcite developped a phenomenological model of the burst rise process and showed that simple measures of the burst morphology can be robust diagnostics of ignition latitude and burning regime .",
    "they simulated burst light curves with ignition at different latitudes on the ns surface , and they found that bursts that ignite near the equator always show positive convexity , whereas bursts that ignite near the poles show either positive or negative convexity values .",
    "they also found that the chemical composition of the burning material has a strong influence on convexity , and the rise times increase as the ignition point moves towards the poles .",
    "4u 172834 is an ucxb ( h - poor donor ) , and has only helium - rich bursts with short rise times and similar duration @xcite .",
    "therefore , the chemical composition does not have a big influence on the convexity and rise time of the bursts in 4u 172834 .",
    "simulations from @xcite show that the different inclinations and source rotation rate have a very small effect on convexity .",
    "so , only the ignition latitude must have a strong influence on the burst properties in 4u 172934 .",
    "this suggests that bursts with oscillations in 4u 172834 ignite at high latitudes , whereas bursts without oscillations ignite at low latitudes on the ns surface .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite in the case of 4u 163653 .",
    "we analysed 121 type - i x - ray bursts in the accreting ns lmxb system 4u 172834 .",
    "we found that :    * the rise time and convexity in bursts with and without oscillations are different .",
    "bursts with oscillations have short rise time and both positive and negative convexity values , whereas bursts without oscillations have long rise time and only positive convexity values . * around the peak of the burst , the light curves are more asymmetric in bursts with oscillations than in bursts without oscillations . * in the early decay phase of the bursts , the energy spectrum is different in bursts with and without oscillations .",
    "the spectrum can be explained by the ns atmosphere model only in the bursts without oscillations .",
    "* during the cooling phase , bursts in which the blackbody radius remains more or less constant for @xmath57 s show coherent oscillations , whereas bursts in which the blackbody radius changes rapidly show no coherent oscillations . *",
    "bursts with oscillations ignite at high latitude when mass accretion rate onto the ns surface is high , whereas burst without oscillations ignite at low latitude when mass accretion rate is low .",
