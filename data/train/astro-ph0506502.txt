    "thus , the cyanide molecules are much more stable than their isocyanide isomers , and therefore it is highly unlikely that any thermal process can satisfactorily explain the formation of isocyanide molecules .",
    "this indicates that a non - thermal process is necessary to convert a cyanide into an isocyanide species .    in recent laboratory experiments performed by hudson & moore ( 2004 ) ,",
    "cyanide species were bombarded by both protons and uv - photons to determine what would happen to the structure of the molecule . bombarding a pure ice sample of ch@xmath0cn  at 24 k , the proton experiment yielded ketenimine ( ch@xmath1cnh ) , another isomer of ch@xmath0cn , as well as ch@xmath0nc  in a slightly lower abundance .",
    "similarly , the uv - photon experiment at 12 k yielded ch@xmath0nc   as the primary product .",
    "these products were also seen when ch@xmath0cn  was embedded in n@xmath1 ice and then irradiated .",

    "the destruction of ch@xmath0cn  was faster than at 12 k , but the same end products were seen .",
    "this suggests that the reactions were driven more by the radiation dose than the sample temperature ( hudson & moore 2004 ) , reinforcing our suggestion that non - thermal processes may be the primary route to the formation of interstellar isocyanides .",
    "laboratory experiments involving ch@xmath1chcn , ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn , and cyanoacetylene ( hc@xmath1cn ) , all showed similar results for isocyanide isomers .",
    "it is likely that a similar reaction involving hc@xmath2cn  will produce hc@xmath2nc .",
    "furthermore , these laboratory experiments also suggest that all isocyanides are likely to be formed under the conditions which interstellar ch@xmath0nc  was detected .",
    "based on the column density ratios and upper limits in table 1 , we did not detect any emission from ch@xmath0ch@xmath1nc  and hc@xmath2nc  because of the possibility that we did not integrate long enough to detect these species .",
    "on the other hand , hudson & moore ( 2004 ) also conducted experiments with cyanides embedded in h@xmath1o ice and found that hydrogen addition and subtraction reactions were taking place in both radiation bombardment reactions in which _ no _ isocyanides were formed . in these experiments",
    "hc@xmath1cn hydrogenated to ch@xmath1chcn  and then to ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn .",
    "based on the aforementioned laboratory results , we will suggest how large cyanides and their corresponding isocyanide isomers may be produced in the extended regions surrounding sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "the sgr  b2(n ) region is known to contain widespread shocks ( chengular & kanekar 2003 ) .",
    "such shocks have been presumed to be responsible for the formation and distribution of large aldehyde molecules toward this region ( hollis et al .",
    "2004a , b ) .",
    "furthermore , it is also well known that there is ambient uv flux and cosmic ray flux in these regions . on the surfaces and mantles of dust grains , larger species such as ch@xmath0cn and hc@xmath1cn",
    "may be present .",
    "ch@xmath1chcn  and ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn  are formed as a result of h - addition reactions , thus depleting hc@xmath1cn . as a shock passes ,",
    "these large molecules are expelled from the grain surface into the gas phase . at this point",
    "uv and cosmic rays may interact with the cyanide species and form isocyanides . as a result",
    ", the isocyanides show an extended distribution . in hot cores ,",
    "there is a lower uv and cosmic ray flux due to the large column density of gas and dust .",
    "furthermore , thermal processes are the primary mechanism to liberate molecules off grain surfaces ( tielens & hagen 1982 ; hasegawa , herbst , & lueng 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , this is initially why these regions were believed to be the ideal places to form large molecules ( ehrenfreund & charnley 2000 ) .",
    "also , in these compact regions , it is believed warm gas phase chemistry in addition to grain surface chemistry can form large molecules which may account for the enhanced abundances of ch@xmath1chcn  and ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn  in hot core regions ( liu & snyder 1999 , see also ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn  column density in table  2 with respect to table  1 ) .",
    "however , thermal processes are not enough to form isocyanide species after the cyanides have been expelled from the grain and hence there should be a depletion of isocyanides towards hot cores .",
    "our observations support this hypothesis .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the chemical bonding energies for cyanide molecules studied herein ( ch@xmath0cn , ch@xmath1chcn , ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn , & hc@xmath2cn ) and found they are much greater ( @xmath68500 @xmath7 ) than that of the corresponding isocyanide isomers . as a consequence ,",
    "cyanide interstellar molecules are most likely preferentially formed at the expense of isocyanide isomers . moreover , in the case of ch@xmath0cn , it is seen in the lmh hot core and in the surrounding medium while ch@xmath0nc appears to be deficient in the lmh hot core .",
    "this suggests that large - scale , non - thermal processes such as shocks or enhanced uv flux in the surrounding medium account for the conversion of ch@xmath0cn to ch@xmath0nc while the lmh hot core is dominated by thermal processes which can not produce a significant amount of ch@xmath0nc .",
    "hudson & moore ( 2004 ) have shown that radiation bombardment of ch@xmath0cn in ice analog experiments can produce ch@xmath0nc , thus tending to support what is observed .",
    "additionally , since ch@xmath0nc is deficient in the lmh and ch@xmath0cn is prevalent , this suggests that the relative abundance ratio between these two isomers is not meaningful because the molecules are not co - spatial .",
    "this may well apply to other cyanide and isocyanide isomers .",
