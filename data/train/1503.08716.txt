    "[ fig.1 ] & [ fig.2 ] ) in absence of any external magnetic field .",
    "moreover particularly at low temperatures , there exist certain other discrete values of @xmath3 , for each of which the pairwise concurrence for the strongly coupled pairs abruptly diminishes to a lower value and then remains steady with the increase of @xmath3 , until next such critical value of @xmath3 arrives ; giving rise to a staircase structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) , which is easier to identify when one takes a constant temperature 2-d slice at a low temperature like the figure  [ fig.3(a ) ] and [ fig.3(b ) ] .",
    "it may be apparent from these figures ( figs .",
    "[ fig.3(a ) ] and [ fig.3(b ) ] ) that this staircase structure is more pronounced with smaller values of dimer strength @xmath18 .",

    "[ fig.4(a ) ] & [ fig.4(b ) ] that at zero magnetic field weakly coupled pairs are completely separable and they get entangled only after a specific value of external magnetic field sets in ( depending upon @xmath18 ) , which may be considered as a case of magnetic entanglement .",

    "the staircase structure may be contributed by the gapped nature of the energy spectra for dimer chains , but further investigation is required to identify the actual mechanism .    to investigate the effect of inclination of external magnetic field , the dimerized xx chain is chosen .",
    "the variation of the inclination of magnetic field has also been studied and for different angles the variations of the pairwise entanglement with field strength are plotted in figs .  [ fig.6(a ) ] , [ fig.6(b ) ] & [ fig.6(c ) ] .",
    "it has been found that for xx dimer chain even the strongly coupled pairs develop less amount of entanglement as expected intuitively , but it is observed that at low temperature with the increase of @xmath52 , the entanglement first diminishes to almost zero at a critical value of @xmath52 and then again build up ; moreover this build up increases with the relative strength of the longitudinal component of external field , i.e. @xmath54 or in other word with the angle of tilt .",

    "the studies already mentioned correspond to closed chains which have translational symmetry .",
    "but as this study has been motivated by the communication aspect of the dimers as recently proposed by some authors ( refs ) , it is natural to extend these studies for open xxx dimer chains . due to absence of translational symmetry",
    "each pair has some unique feature in phase transition .",
