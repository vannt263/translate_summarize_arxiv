    "the continued effort to develop accurate and efficient approaches for the calculation of the dynamics of many - body quantum systems has produced a rich variety of methods , ranging from the numerically exact to the approximate .",
    "while exact methods provide important benchmark results for model systems,@xcite their computational cost makes them impractical for realistic multidimensional systems .",
    "conversely , approximate methods , whether perturbative@xcite or based on quasi-@xcite or semi - classical@xcite approaches , tend to scale more gracefully with system size and can address both model and realistic systems , albeit at the expense of general applicability and accuracy . for cases where one is interested in the dynamics of a limited number of degrees of freedom , the nakajima - zwanzig ( nz ) equation@xcite provides a useful starting point for a plethora of methods based on generalized quantum master equations ( gqme ) .",
    "the nz equation , which may be derived via the projection operator technique,@xcite dictates the evolution of the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) for the portion of the hilbert space denoted as the system .",
    "the influence of the complementary subspace , referred to as the bath , on the rdm dynamics appears in the form of a memory term , full knowledge of which is tantamount to solving the original problem .",
    "the apparent simplicity of the nz equation , however , belies the complexity of the memory term , which can be formidably difficult if not impossible to calculate exactly . despite the seeming conservation of difficulty ,",
    "different treatments of the memory kernel have led to manageable and often very successful approximate and numerically exact schemes.@xcite    a major difficulty in the calculation of the memory kernel lies in the fact that its dynamical evolution involves the `` projected '' propagator , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the projector that defines the reduced dynamics . to circumvent the problem of projected dynamics ,",
    "shi and geva@xcite proposed a self - consistent expansion of the memory kernel , which requires the calculation of auxiliary kernels evolved with the _ normal _ rather than the _ projected _ propagator . from an exact perspective , this approach is useful only if the numerical effort necessary for the calculation of the auxiliary memory kernels is less than that required for the direct calculation of the system dynamics .",
    "using the numerically exact quasi - adiabatic path integral ( quapi ) method,@xcite shi and geva have shown that the memory kernel for the spin - boson model can decay up to 10 times faster than the system dynamics,@xcite lending credence to the feasibility of the self - consistent approach .",
    "more recently , a similar scheme has been used by rabani and co - workers within a path integral framework for the study of quantum transport problems.@xcite just as importantly , applications of the method have successfully used semi- and quasi - classical theories to calculate the auxiliary kernels.@xcite in particular , kelly , markland , and coworkers have illustrated the impressive accuracy and robustness of this approach in both model and realistic problems.@xcite these studies have led to two important conclusions : ( i ) the memory kernels are short - lived in a wide region of parameter space for canonical problems such as the spin - boson model and ( ii ) the self - consistent solution of the memory kernel using approximate dynamics can yield impressively more accurate results than _ direct _ simulation of the rdm dynamics using the very same approximate method .    despite these important results , questions of general applicability still remain .",
    "for instance , the conditions that lead to short - lived memory kernels remain unknown .",
    "further , it is still unclear how the breakdown of approximate methods ( in unfavorable parameter regimes ) affects the quality of the self - consistently extracted memory function .",
    "perhaps most importantly , an understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions from which the improvement in the accuracy of approximate dynamics from use in conjunction with the memory function formalism as observed in refs . is lacking .",
    "finally , the convergence properties of different versions of the auxiliary memory kernels arising from the alternative closures in the self - consistent expansion of the memory function have not yet been explored .",
    "we expect these convergence properties to differ when approximate methods are employed in the calculation of the auxiliary kernels .    the remarkable utility of the nz equation notwithstanding , objects beyond single - time nonequilibrium dynamics are either cumbersome to obtain within this framework . despite this difficulty , recent work",
    "has generalized the nz equation to multi - time correlation functions.@xcite in contrast , the more flexible mori formulation permits direct extension to multiple - time and equilibrium correlation functions , which are essential in the treatment of linear@xcite and non - linear spectroscopy,@xcite and the calculation of chemical rate constants@xcite and kinetic coefficients,@xcite to name a few examples .",
    "for this reason , in paper i ( this paper ) of this series , we provide a unified mori - type framework to approach single - time nonequilibrium correlation functions , and address several of the open questions listed above . in a second paper",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we focus on the spin - boson ( sb ) hamiltonian , which is representative of typical open quantum systems , but note that the current approach is general and may be applied to any hamiltonian.@xcite in particular , a major advantage of the mori formalism developed here over the traditional nz approach is the ability to treat systems with no natural system - bath separation , such as spin - chains and lattice models@xcite or liquids.@xcite we reserve these applications for later work .",

    "while coherences often decay faster than populations , their decay is often slower than bath correlations , as long as the bath dimensionality is large .",
