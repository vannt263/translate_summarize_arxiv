    "we measured the widths of the ca ii k emission lines for our samples using the method from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the predicted width of the boes instrumental profile is about 0.1  , which we estimated from the emission lines in the comparison lamp spectrum and is 5 @xmath7 28 @xmath16 of the line widths of the ca ii k emission line of our samples ( the median value is @xmath7 15 @xmath16 ) .",

    "when we used only the 114 stars within 200 pc to minimize the extinction effect as in @xcite , the derived wbr was not very different ( 0.03 mag ) from our original wbr ( eq .  ( [ eq_wbr_lke ] ) ) .",
