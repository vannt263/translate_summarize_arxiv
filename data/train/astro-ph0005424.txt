    "the system is installed at the german / spanish 3.5 m telescope on calar alto near almeria , spain .    the laser used for generating the artificial guide star is a high power continuous - wave dye laser .",
    "it is installed in the coud lab of the telescope , and the laser beam is fed along the coud train until it is picked off near the primary mirror and directed into a 50-cm launch telescope .",

    "there are several lenslet arrays which can be interchanged , and the positions of the resulting laser beacon centroids in the shack - hartmann sensor are determined and used to derive coefficients of zernike or karhunen - loeve modes which are then used to control a 97-actuator deformable mirror .",

    "this mirror is driven by a closed control loop with a correction bandwidth of up to 17  hz . the natural guide star within the near - infrared isoplanatic patch must be brighter than about m@xmath25  mag . the sharp ii+ camera ( hofmann et al .",

    "the wavelength range of our observations covers the atmospheric j , h and k bands .",
    "compared with the johnson k band , we used a somewhat narrower k@xmath7 filter ( 1.99  2.32 @xmath19 m ) in order to reduce the thermal background .",
    "goal of our investigation was to exploit structural information on galaxy cluster members from adaptive optics and seeing limited images and interpret the results making use of all available quantities and known correlations .",
    "the photometric quality of the data is of the order of 0.10@xmath5 in the k- and h - band and 0.15@xmath5 in the j - band .",
    "the sources were mainly selected on the basis of availability during the allocated observing time , the presence of bright ao reference stars , and the availability of additional literature data .",
    "the sample described at the end of section 2.3.1 was selected on the basis hi deficiency and beeing located within or outside the clusters abell radii .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in order to check how representative the individual galaxies that we studied are we compared their luminosities to those of @xmath26 galaxies at the corresponding redshifts of the three clusters at @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . from a subsample of the optically selected anglo - australian redshift - survey , mobasher et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find the best infrared schechter luminosity function parameters as @xmath27 with @xmath28 for @xmath29  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 and @xmath30 . from their sample",
    "they also find that e / s0 and spirals have identical infrared luminosity functions within the errors .",
    "their parameters are very much in agreement with recent determinations of @xmath31 by de propris et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and gardner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 = 0.5 they find @xmath34 with bright galaxy slopes of @xmath35 and @xmath36 0.1 with @xmath37 0.1 , respectively .",
    "for the purpose of comparison we use the same values for @xmath38 and @xmath33 and obtain the following results for our targets :    * abell  262 : * for our low redshift cluster both objects we study here ",
    "ugc  1344 and ugc  1347  are @xmath26 galaxies to within less than 0.5 magnitudes .    * j1836.3cr : * for this cluster we find that the bright source @xmath39 is just 0.6 magnitude brighter and that the other sources are about 1 to 2 magnitudes fainter than a typical @xmath26 galaxy at that redshift of @xmath11 .",
    "* pks  0743 - 006 : * for the 3 presumed galaxies close to the quasar pks  0743 - 006 at @xmath12 we find that two are about 0.7 magnitudes brighter than an @xmath26 galaxy and the weakest one is 2 magnitudes fainter than @xmath26 .",
    "this is consistent with the statement that the brighter members of the observed clusters are on the k-@xmath40 relation which , as emphasized by lilly ( @xcite ) , shows only a small scatter of @xmath41  mag at redshifts below @xmath42 . in addition",
    "it should be mentioned that the quasar pks  0743 - 006 itself shows very similar colors compared to the galaxy candidates in the observed field . however , due to the nuclear contribution it is  as expected ( see data in dunlop et al .",
    "@xcite and lehnert et al .",
    "@xcite )  between 1.5 and 2 mag brighter than what is predicted by the galaxy k-@xmath40 relation .",
    "we also find that the measured jhk fluxes of this variable quasar were at the time we took the data about 0.7 to 1.0 magnitudes below what is given in the literature ( white et al .",
    "@xcite , lpine et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since quasar host galaxies have been found to be often as bright as @xmath43 ( mcleod & rieke @xcite , snchez et al .",
    "@xcite ) the underlying host galaxy may contribute substantially to the overall flux density of the quasar in this low state .",
    "this indicates that the source properties that we determined in the previous sections are representative for typical @xmath26 cluster members at the corresponding redshifts .",
    "we have presented high angular resolution nir observations of three galaxy clusters at different redshifts using adaptive optics . in the case of the barred spiral ugc  1347 in abell  262 we presented the first adaptive optics data using the laser guide star provided by the alfa system .",
    "the diagnostic ratios for the nucleus of ucg  1347 indicate recent and ongoing star formation activity .",
    "in addition to the resolved nir nucleus in ugc  1347 we found a bright and compact region of recent and enhanced star formation at one tip of the bar . the @xmath44 ratio as well as the v",
    "@xmath2  k color of that region imply that a starburst happened about 10@xmath3 years ago . for ugc  1344 we found that the overall star formation activity is low and that the system is deficient in the fuel for star formation .",
    "the comparison of seeing - corrected nuclear bulge sizes of a sample of 26 cluster galaxies within and outside of the abell radius of abell  262 and abell  1367 indicates that the galaxies in the inner part of the cluster show a tendency for more compact bulges than those outside .",
    "this phenomenon can tentatively be ascribed to an increased star formation activity due to interactions of cluster members inside the abell radius .",
    "such an increase of central activity is also indicated at other wavelengths .",
    "scodeggio and gavazzi ( @xcite ) find in a 21  cm survey of spiral galaxies in clusters that about 30% of them show extended radio continuum emission and that a substantial fraction of those ( but not all ) show indications of interaction .",
    "moss and whittle ( @xcite ) find from an h@xmath0 survey of cluster spirals that interacting spirals show a strong tendency to have compact nuclear h@xmath0 emission which the authors conclude to be most likely due to tidally induced star formation from galaxy - galaxy interactions , since interactions are more likely to happen close to the cluster center .",
    "several successive high - speed encounters between galaxies may lead to gas inflow and strong star formation activity ( fujita @xcite ) .",
    "this would imply that dynamically induced star formation is more important in the center than the outer parts of a cluster , although current investigations have not yet convincingly shown the obvious presence of such an correlation .",
    "future observations of larger samples of cluster members are clearly needed to substantiate these correlations .    since the spiral content of galaxy clusters at higher redshifts is about as large as the spiral content in the field at @xmath45 ( oemler et al .",
    "@xcite ) , detailed observations of galaxies in low - redshift spiral - rich clusters may provide essential information of the cluster evolution at higher redshifts in general . in particular it would allow us to study in detail the influence of galaxy harassment .",
    "abell  262 and abell  1367 are spiral - rich clusters . with a ratio of spirals to s0 and e0 galaxies of 47%/53% and 43%/57% , respectively ,",
    "their spiral content is similar to that in the field at @xmath45 of 55%/45% and to that in clusters at a redshift of @xmath46 of 40%/60%  ( oemler @xcite ) .",
    "ugc  1347 and ugc  1344 could very well be taken as examples of the blue and red fraction of clusters at higher redshift .",
    "couch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reports on 3 galaxy clusters at @xmath47 measured with the hst . in these clusters",
    "he finds the fraction of spirals at least 3 times higher than at @xmath45 which would approximately correspond to the spiral fraction of abell  262 and abell  1367 .",
    "about 20% of all galaxies show signs of interaction .",
    "the blue fraction of the cluster population shows morphologies similar to sb - sdm / irr galaxies with compact knotty regions of star formation .",
    "these knots may be very similar to the bright star formation region we found for ugc  1347 .",
    "the red fraction of the cluster population they find is 1 - 2 gyr past the last major star formation event and has morphological similarities to s0-sb disks .",
    "this may be very similar to ugc  1344 and source @xmath39 in j1836.3cr .",
    "however , the radial profile of source @xmath39 in j1836.3cr shows indications for recent or ongoing interactions between cluster members . here the enhanced flux above the de vaucouleurs fit to the data at larger radii identifies source @xmath39 as the central cd galaxy in a rich cluster environment in which interactions between cluster members are probably still of importance for their further evolution .    from an investigation of nir colors hutchings & neff ( @xcite )",
    "find for 5 quasars at redshifts ranging from @xmath48 to 0.3 that they are located in mostly evolved groups of galaxies with an indication for average extinction values of @xmath49 = 23  mag quite similar to j1836.3cr at @xmath11 discussed in this paper .",
    "however , on the basis of large - scale investigations ( butcher & oemler , @xcite , ellis @xcite ) as well as studies of individual galaxy clusters ( e.g. morris et al .",
    "@xcite ) one finds that both in clusters and in the field the blue fraction of galaxies generally increases towards higher redshifts ( the butcher oemler effect , boe ) .",
    "this is consistent with our finding of relatively blue nir colors in the galaxy candidates associated with pks  0743 - 006 at @xmath12 .",
    "based on an investigation of abell  2390 at @xmath50 and a comparison to the cluster ms  1621.5 + 2640 at @xmath51 abraham et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and morris et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that the star formation process is shut down by a combination of gas stripping followed by gas exhaustion via star formation .",
    "this truncation of star formation activity may explain both the boe and the large fraction of s0 galaxies in clusters .",
    "this also suggests that truncated star formation induced by infall does not play a major role in driving cluster galaxy evolution at lower redshifts although this mechanism may have played a role in earlier history .",
    "the barred structure of ugc  1347 as well as the strong recent star formation event at one tip of the bar may indicate that this object is well suited to study the corresponding physical processes of cluster galaxy evolution in great detail .",

    "<S> we report on high angular resolution near - infrared ( nir ) observations of three galaxy clusters at different redshifts using adaptive optics ( ao ) . in the case of the barred spiral in abell  262 we presented the first ao results obtained using a laser guide star . </S>",
    "<S> the observations have been carried out with the mpe / mpia adaptive optics laser guide star system alfa and the eso ao system adonis combined with the sharp  ii+ camera built at mpe . </S>",
    "<S> the three clusters are well suited for high resolution investigations since bright field stars for tip - tilt or wavefront sensing are located close to the line of sight to cluster galaxies . in summary </S>",
    "<S> our high angular resolution nir data combined with other information clearly indicates star formation activity or interaction between cluster members at all three redshifts . the results and implications for future high angular resolution adaptive optics observations </S>",
    "<S> are discussed in the framework of current galaxy and cluster evolution models .    for two barred galaxies in the abell  262 cluster , and ugc  1347 </S>",
    "<S> , we interpret our nir imaging results in combination with published radio , far - infrared , and h@xmath0 data in the framework of a star formation model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the star - forming resolved nir nucleus in ugc  1347 we found a bright and compact region of recent and enhanced star formation at one tip of the bar . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 ratio as well as the v  @xmath2  k color of that region imply a starburst that happened about 10@xmath3 years ago . for ugc  1344 </S>",
    "<S> we find that the overall star formation activity is low and that the system is deficient in fuel for star formation .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of star formation in galaxy clusters is also supported by a comparison of seeing corrected nuclear bulge sizes of a sample of spiral galaxies within and outside the central hi deficient zone of the abell  262 and clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the galaxies inside the abell radii of both clusters show a tendency for more compact bulges than those outside . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon could be due to increased star formation activity triggered by interactions of cluster members inside the abell radius .    </S>",
    "<S> the star formation activity in the two higher redshift clusters j1836.3cr and pks  0743 - 006 is investigated via comparison to gissel stellar population models in jhk two - color - diagrams . while j1836.3cr is consistent with an evolved cluster , the objects in the field of pks  0743 - 006 show indications of more recent star formation activity . the central object in j1836.3cr shows a radial intensity profile that is indicative for cd galaxies in a rich cluster environment . </S>",
    "<S> extended wings in its light distribution may be consistent with recent or ongoing galaxy - galaxy interaction in this cluster . </S>"
