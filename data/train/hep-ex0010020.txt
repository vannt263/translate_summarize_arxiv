    "for about 20 years measurements of photon structure functions give deep insight into the rich structure of a fundamental gauge boson , the photon .",
    "a recent review on this subject can be found in  @xcite . here , the discussion is restricted to the measurement of , which recently has been achieved for the first time . only the main features of the analysis are given , the experimental details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross - section for deep inelastic electron - photon scattering , shown in figure  [ fig : fig01 ] , is given by @xmath2\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : approx }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here  is the absolute value of the four momentum squared of the exchanged virtual photon , @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 are the usual dimensionless variables of deep inelastic scattering and  is the fine structure constant . in experimental analyses",
    "@xmath5 is usually small .",
    "consequently , the term proportional to the longitudinal structure function  can be neglected and the differential cross - section is directly proportional to , which is related to the sum over the quark parton distribution functions @xmath6 of the quasi - real photon , @xmath7 , via @xmath8\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : f2def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the large scale established by their masses , the contribution to  from heavy quarks can be calculated in perturbative qcd . at present collider energies",
    "only the contribution of charm quarks  is important .",
    "like the structure function for light quarks ,  receives contributions from the point - like and the hadron - like component of the photon shown in figure  [ fig : fig01 ] .    because of the charge of the charm quarks their contribution to is large and the importance increases for increasing values of , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : fig02 ] , which shows the contributions from light quarks and from charm quarks separately , as predicted by the grv parametrisations  @xcite .",
    "charm quarks can only be produced if the photon - photon invariant mass @xmath9 is at least twice the mass of the charm quarks . using @xmath10",
    "this leads to the varying production threshold in @xmath0 as a function of  seen in figure  [ fig : fig02 ] .",
    "close to the production threshold , the point - like contribution to is accurately approximated by the prediction of the lowest order bethe - heitler formula . for quasi - real photons also the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) predictions have been calculated in  @xcite .    for the hadron - like contribution",
    "the photon - quark coupling must be replaced by the gluon - quark coupling , and the bethe - heitler formula has to be integrated over the allowed range in fractional momentum of the gluon using a parametrisation of the gluon distribution function of the photon , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the predicted behaviour of the point - like and hadron - like component of  for different values of  is shown in figure  [ fig : fig03 ] , using the sas1d  @xcite and grs  @xcite parametrisations .",
    "for @xmath11 the structure function is saturated by the point - like component which is only slowly suppressed for increasing virtualities  of the quasi - real photon .",
    "in contrast , the hadron - like contribution dominates at small values of @xmath0 and decreases much faster for increasing .",
    "finally , lowering the mass of the charm quarks leads to a higher threshold in @xmath0 .    given",
    "this predicted behaviour , the region of @xmath11 can be used to test a purely perturbative nlo qcd prediction with only  and  as free parameters , and the low @xmath0 behaviour mainly probes the gluon distribution function of the photon .",
    "the lo monte carlo generators herwig 5.9  @xcite and vermaseren  @xcite are used , both with @xmath12  . in herwig charm production is modelled using matrix elements for massless charm quarks , together with the grv parametrisation for the parton distributions of the photon , again for massless charm quarks .",
    "the effect of the charm quark mass is only accounted for by not simulating events with @xmath13 . due to the massless approach used in herwig and the crude treatment at threshold ,",
    "the predicted charm production cross - section is likely to be too large .",
    "the vermaseren generator is based on the quark parton model ( qpm ) and consequently does not take into account the hadron - like component of the photon structure .",
    "however , the complete dependence of the cross - section on the different photon helicities is modelled .",
    "the measurement of  proceeds along the same lines as the measurement of  with the addition of the identification of the charm quarks via the reconstruction of  mesons .",
    "events are selected with an energy of the scattered electron above 50  , measured in the angular ranges ( a ) @xmath14  mrad or ( b ) @xmath15  mrad from either beam direction , thereby covering the approximate range in  of @xmath16  .",
    "the visible hadronic mass  is required to be below 60  .",
    "charm quarks are identified via @xmath17 , followed by @xmath18 or @xmath19 . using @xmath20 and the branching ratios of the  decay modes of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "this analysis covers only about 4@xmath23 of all events containing a pair of charm quarks . for a clear acceptance",
    "the  mesons are further required to fulfill , @xmath24 and @xmath25  for ( a ) or ( b ) .",
    "together with a typical selection efficiency of about 25@xmath23 only about 1@xmath23 of all @xmath26 events are positively identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig04 ] shows the distribution of the difference between the  and the  candidate mass . in both samples a clear peak is visible around @xmath27  .",
    "subtracting the background , obtained from a fit to the upper sideband of the signal , @xmath28  mesons are found in the peak region .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig05 ] shows the distributions of  and of the measured  in comparison to the predictions of the herwig and vermaseren monte carlo generators normalised to the number of data events .",
    "both monte carlo generators give a good description of the shape of the data distributions .",
    "the cross - section for  production is determined in the well - measured kinematic range described above .",
    "based on this and the extrapolation factors obtained from the monte carlo models the full cross - section  and  are evaluated in two bins of @xmath0 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath11 the predictions of the vermaseren and herwig monte carlo models are very similar .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath31 , there are two main differences .",
    "firstly the selection efficiency for events with  mesons fulfilling the kinematical requirements is different , and secondly , and even more important , the predicted cross - section within the invisible phase - space is largely different for the two models , resulting in different extrapolation factors , 12.9/5.1 for herwig / vermaseren .",
    "since the hadron - like contribution is neglected in the qpm , the vermaseren cross - section is much smaller than the lo and the nlo cross - section for @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , mainly due to the massless approach taken , the prediction from herwig is higher than the cross - section from the lo and the nlo calculation",
    ". therefore it is likely that the correct cross - section , and therefore the correct extrapolation factor , lies within the range of the two monte carlo predictions .",
    "the measured  for @xmath32  is shown in figure  [ fig : fig06 ] .",
    "the central values are obtained by averaging the results using the herwig and vermaseren monte carlo models , and half the difference is taken as extrapolation error , which dominates the uncertainty for @xmath31 .",
    "the nlo prediction is based on @xmath12  , the renormalisation and factorisation scales are chosen to be @xmath33 , and the hadron - like contribution to  uses the grv parametrisation .",
    "the nlo corrections are small for the whole @xmath0 range .",
    "the band for the nlo calculation is evaluated by varying  between 1.3 and 1.7  gev and using @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath11 the error of the measured cross - section is dominated by the statistical uncertainty , and the nlo calculation with only  and  as free parameters is in good agreement with the data .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath31 , the result suffers from the strong model dependence discussed above . despite this uncertainty",
    "the corrected data suggest a cross - section which is above the purely point - like component , i.e. the hadron - like component of  is non - zero .        by using the massive matrix elements available in herwig6.1 and the full integrated luminosity of more than 500  of the lep2 programme , the measurement is likely to be improved considerably , both concerning the statistical and the systematic error .",
