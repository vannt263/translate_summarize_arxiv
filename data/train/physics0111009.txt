    "<S> we investigate the role of thermal instability , arising from radiative cooling of an optically thin , dusty plasma , by linear stability analysis . the corresponding isobaric stability condition for condensation mode </S>",
    "<S> is found to be modified significantly by the degree of ionization and concentration of finite sized , relatively heavy , and negatively charged dust particles . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that though the fundamental wave mode is similar in nature to the one in absence of dust particles , a new dust - wave mode can propagate in such a plasma . </S>",
    "<S> it is conjectured that the presence of negatively charged dust particles may considerably affect the stability of various astrophysical structures against thermal instability , which can not be explained with the help of gravitational instability .    </S>",
    "<S> thermal instability , dusty plasma 53.20.ex , 52.30.-g , 98.58.-w    the formation and existence of a large number of astrophysical structures such as interstellar clouds , solar prominence , localized structures in planetary nebulae etc .  can not be explained by means of conventional gravitational instability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been argued that thermal instability may be a reasonably good candidate , with can accelerate condensation , giving rise to localized structures which grow in density by loosing heat , mainly through radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first comprehensive analysis of thermal instability in a diffuse interstellar gas is first given by field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , many authors considered the process of thermal instability in different circumstances e.g.  in hydrogen plasmas @xcite , to explain formation of clumpy gas clouds in two phase medium @xcite , and thermal instabilities in photoioized interstellar gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , birk @xcite has considered thermal condensations in a weakly ionized hydrogen plasma .    in recent years , however , it has been realized that heavier dust particles constitutes an ubiquitous and important component of many astrophysical plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite including interstellar clouds , stellar and planetary atmosphere , planetary nebulae etc . </S>",
    "<S> it is , thus of particular interest to see the effect of dust particles on the role of thermal instability in astrophysical situations . </S>",
    "<S> one of the obvious facts of introducing dust as a component of plasma is the propagation of very low frequency compressional modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we , in this paper , investigate thermal instabilities in a multicomponent plasma with electrons , ions , and dust particles , assuming that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the average dust size , @xmath2 is the average inter - dust distance , and @xmath3 is the debye length . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dust particles to be negatively charged and cold , whereas the ions can loose energy through radiation by de - excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that electrons are isothermal . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a heat - loss function @xcite exclusive of thermal conduction , which takes care of the radiative loss . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we do not take into account the dust - charge fluctuation , which usually has a stabilizing effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant equations are two - fluid magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations with boltzmann distribution for the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the dust acoustic ( da ) and dust - ion acoustic ( dia ) modes @xcite are ruled out by virtue of ` cold dust ' assumption . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the isobaric condition for thermal condensation mode is significantly modified by the inclusion of dust dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the existence of a new wave mode , solely because of the presence of the dust particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by writing out the equations for a unbounded , weakly collisional dusty plasma with a heat - loss function @xmath4 , which represents the rate of net loss of energy per unit mass , through radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dust particles to be negatively charged and cold and the electrons obey boltzmann relation . </S>",
    "<S> we assume here that that ion - neutral collisional cross - section is of the same order as that of the electron - neutral collisions , so that the electrons can be treated as boltzmann distribution if @xmath5 , and in practice this condition is satisfied in the cases we are going to consider in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the equations are , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ion thermal conductivity , @xmath8 are ionization and recombination frequencies , and the other symbols have their usual meanings . </S>",
    "<S> the subscripts @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 respectively refer to the electron , ion , and dust populations . equations ( [ dust_cont ] ) through ( [ ion_temp ] ) are the continuity and momentum equations for dusts , boltzmann relation for the electrons , and continuity , momentum , and energy equations for the ions . </S>",
    "<S> the set of equations is closed by the quasineutrality condition , @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the ion and dust charge numbers , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have taken into account the possibility of multiply ionized ions . </S>",
    "<S> the ion pressure is given by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 are expressed in energy units ) and we have assumed that @xmath15 , the ratio of specific heats for the ions to be 5/3 . the recombination loss term in the ion - continuity equation represents the electron - ion recombination on the surface of the dust particles @xcite and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dust radius and @xmath18 is the sound speed .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider now a small perturbation of the form @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the linearized expression for electron , dust , and ion densities are given by @xmath20 where we have used the linearized form of the boltzmann relation for the electrons eq.([boltz ] ) , dust - continuity equation eq.([dust_cont ] ) , and the quasineutrality condition eq.([quasi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities with subscript ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' are equilibrium and perturbed quantities , respectively and ` @xmath23 ' represents normalized perturbed quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we have normalized the perturbed densities of the species by their respective equilibrium values and perturbed electrostatic potential energy @xmath24 by equilibrium electron thermal energy , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath26 are the ratios of equilibrium electron and dust densities to that of the ions for @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> the linearized ion - continuity and momentum equations are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ion - sound frequency , @xmath30 is the ion - thermal speed , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the normalized perturbed ion pressure . finally we write down the linearized energy equation for the ions as @xmath33 & = & 0 \\label{pert_ion_temp}\\\\ % + \\,\\omega_\\rho \\frac{1}{z_i}\\left(\\delta_e-\\delta_dz_d\\frac{\\omega_d^2}{\\omega^2}\\right ) \\tilde\\phi+\\omega_t\\tilde t_i , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> following field @xcite , we define the wave numbers @xmath37 as @xmath38 the first two are the wave numbers of isothermal and isochoric perturbations , respectively and the third one is the reciprocal of mean free path of the heat - conducting particles </S>",
    "<S> . it has been assumed throughout the derivation that the perturbed ion thermal conductivity @xmath39 and the equilibrium heat - loss function @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents @xmath42 and @xmath43 , evaluated for the equilibrium state .    </S>",
    "<S> using eqs.([pert_ne])-([pert_ion_temp ] ) , the dispersion relation for this radiating dusty plasma can now be written as @xmath44 \\nonumber\\\\ % + \\,\\frac{2}{3}\\left[\\frac{1}{z_i}\\!\\left(\\delta_e-\\delta_dz_d \\frac{\\omega_d^2}{\\omega^2}\\right)\\!\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\omega } ( \\omega_\\rho-\\nu_r)-1\\right\\}+\\frac{i}{\\omega } \\left(\\nu_i\\delta_e+\\nu_r\\frac{\\omega_d^2}{\\omega^2}\\right)\\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the relation @xmath45 .    before numerically solving the dispersion relation eq.([dr ] ) , however , it is instructive to analyze eq.([dr ] ) under certain limits . in the limit of collisionless electron - ion plasma with no dust particles and thermal radiation and zero heat - conductivity , eq.([dr ] ) reduces to @xmath46 which is just the ion - sound wave modified by the ion - charge number . </S>",
    "<S> we now look at the expansion of eq.([dr ] ) @xcite , in the limit of weak collisions ( @xmath47 ) and vanishing thermal perturbation i.e.@xmath48 , which , for the condensation mode , is given by @xmath49 \\label{limit2}\\\\ % & & + \\,\\frac{8\\delta_e^4}{\\omega_i^2(5\\delta_e+3z_i\\tau)^4)}(3\\omega_\\rho+ 2\\omega_t)\\left[\\omega_\\rho-\\omega_t\\left(1+\\frac{z_i}{\\delta_e } \\tau\\right)\\right]^2 \\nonumber\\\\ % & & + \\,\\mathcal{o}\\bigl(\\omega_{\\rho , t}^5\\bigr ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have substituted @xmath50 and neglected @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic velocity of the modes , we are interested , is @xmath52 and in a plasma with cold dusts ( @xmath53 ) , as this one , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in interstellar clouds , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , so that we can safely assume @xmath61 . to the leading order </S>",
    "<S> , we have the radiation condensation mode if , @xmath62 which reduces , in the collisionless limit to @xmath63 note that for zero thermal - conductivity , @xmath64 and the above conditions are independent of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions given by inequalities ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) are similar to the isobaric instability condition given by field @xcite , modified by collisions and dust particles . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the presence of a significant dust population ( smaller @xmath66 ) considerably modifies the instability criteria for the condensation mode and has a stabilizing effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the degree of ionization has also a similar effect on the stability of the condensation mode which becomes important in certain situations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in condensations observed in planetary nebulae , the thermal instability is strongly associated with collisions of electrons with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should , however , be noted that the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) do not reduce to one given by field even in absence of dust particles , which is because our consideration of two - fluid approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> the inequality ( [ cond1 ] ) also implies that the growth rate of the condensation mode is independent of the wave number in the short wavelength limit , when the thermal - conductivity is zero in opposite to a thermally conducting plasma ( finite @xmath69 ) , where there is no condensation for sufficiently larger @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> plots of the normalized growth rate ( @xmath70 ) versus normalized wave number ( @xmath71 ) for the condensation mode are shown in fig.1 , in absence of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate of the mode is definitely smaller in presence of dust particles , as we have guessed , but note the lengthening of the cut - off wave number . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the _ knees _ of the lower curves with finite @xmath69 prove to a bifurcation point in a collisional plasma , as we shall see shortly . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters for fig.1 are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are typical for interstellar clouds @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an approximation similar to eq.([limit2 ] ) for collisionless wave modes is given by @xmath79 the instability criteria for a growing wave mode is thus @xmath80 , which is just the isentropic instability criteria , given by field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus argue that the principal wave mode is unaffected by the presence of dust particles , but for a decrease in magnitude , dictated by the term @xmath81 , which proportional to @xmath82 . however , there is one more wave mode which is not apparent from the above analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we can detect the latter only by appropriately solving eq.([dr ] ) , numerically .    in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the the growing - wave modes in a collisionless plasma with considerable dust presence as in case of a planetary nebula @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a purely dust - wave mode ( second figure in fig.2 ) which is otherwise absent in a pure electron - ion plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate of the mode is , however , much smaller . </S>",
    "<S> notice the cut - offs in all these curves . </S>",
    "<S> these figures are with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath74 and @xmath86 , all other parameters being same as in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath87 is typical in planetary nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen a large negative value for @xmath88 so as to drive the wave mode unstable ( see eq.([limit3 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that a condensation mode will always accompany these wave modes ( not shown ) as the condition for condensation instability is readily satisfied in this case ( @xmath89 ) .    in fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the growth rates of modes with collisional effects . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curves represent condensation modes and the dashed one represents the wave mode . </S>",
    "<S> we see a merger of the condensation modes to a growing wave mode at a bifurcation point near @xmath90 .    we should emphasize that we do not have an explicit expression for the interstellar heat - loss function @xmath4 in general , because of an wide variety of compositions of material in different interstellar regions . </S>",
    "<S> besides , several heating and cooling mechanisms may be operative simultaneously and their dependence on local density and temperature may not be known exactly . </S>",
    "<S> delgarno and mccray @xcite , in their classic review , have mentioned about different cooling processes in hi regions . </S>",
    "<S> a relatively concise expression for the heat - loss function in photo - ionized interstellar gases with high metallicity is given by corbelli and ferrara @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the simplest case , for radiative cooling , the heat - loss function can be assumed to be proportional to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 for free - bound transitions and @xmath93 for free - free transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the exact form the heat - loss function is not important at this point . as a prototype example , we assume the heat - loss function used by field @xcite for thermal condensations in planetary nebulae , which is represented by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mean excess ionization temperature of @xmath67 ions . the temperatures are given in the units of @xmath96 , the mean excitation temperature of the @xmath67 level . applying the instability condition ( [ cond2 ] ) in the collisionless case , we have , thermal condensation if , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 ^ 2\\bigr.\\bigr . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{t_limit}\\\\ % & & \\bigl.\\bigl.-\\,8\\hat k_k\\bar t\\zeta(2 + 3\\zeta)\\bigr\\}^{1/2}\\bigr](4 + 6\\zeta)^{-1}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity , we have assumed @xmath100 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the above expression of @xmath101 reduces to usual one when @xmath102 ( single - fluid approximation ) . for @xmath103 , @xmath74 , @xmath77 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 , which in absence of dust becomes @xmath107 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , the presence of dust provides a stabilizing effect against radiative condensations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the range of instability shrinks to zero at @xmath108 , much higher than 1.974 , which is for the dust - less case . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for a planetary nebula with a considerable amount of dust particles , to be stable against the radiative condensation mode , it has to be at a much higher temperature . in fig.4 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the range of unstable temperature with @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> note that a lower value of @xmath66 corresponds to higher dust concentration .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we have found that the instability criterion for the thermal condensation mode is significantly affected by the presence of dust particles , which can severely alter the stability regimes of many astrophysical condensations where a significant number of dust particles are present . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental wave mode is similar in both cases with and without dust particles , though we now have another wave mode , which is due to the presence of dust particles . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have shown that the conventional stability regimes of many astrophysical condensations may be considerably changed . </S>"
