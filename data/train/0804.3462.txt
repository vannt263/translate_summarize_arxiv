    "a quantification of the number density evolution of each galaxy population in successive epochs would provide stringent constraints on galaxy formation models .",
    "this decade has seen enormous progress in this field , particularly in the @xmath3 -band selected high redshift galaxy populations such as the extremely red objects ( eros , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* sometimes also referred to as extremely red galaxies ; ergs ) , @xmath1- , @xmath2- and @xmath3 -band selected galaxies and distant red galaxies .",
    "eros are selected to have very red optical - to - near infrared colors such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( vega magnitudes ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies have shown that observed eros can be classified as either dusty star - forming galaxies , old passive galaxies or agn . @xcite",
    "have shown that the old stellar population is expected to have a strong spectral break between 3000 and 5000  , while the effect of dust reddening in a younger population would produce a smoother spectra .",
    "this effectively segregates the ero population into dusty star - forming and passive old galaxies ( hereafter dero and pero , respectively ) at @xmath12 in the @xmath13 or @xmath14 colour diagram .",
    "mannucci et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that the relative abundances of deros and peros is roughly equal using a sample of 57 eros ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) based on the classification method of @xcite ( their sample was classified as 37% elliptical , 37% star - forming , 9% stars with 17% remaining unclassified ) .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy , morphological and x - ray observations have shown that the comoving space densities of elliptical - like and disk - like eros are comparable over the magnitude range @xmath17 @xcite and that only a small fraction ( 5%-10% ) of eros host agn @xcite .",
    "the additional properties of strong clustering @xcite and the relation of deros to ( ultra ) luminous ir - galaxies has also been examined @xcite . indeed deros have been detected in the infrared with both the @xmath18 observatory @xcite and the @xmath19 space telescope @xcite , with more than 12@xmath20 of the 824@xmath21 m sources being classified as deros in @xmath19 observations of the lockman hole .",
    "deros have also been detected at longer submillimetre wavelengths by the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope in hawaii @xcite .",
    "if deros are detected in significant numbers at infrared - submillimetre wavelengths then they may also be significant contributors to the dusty cosmic star - formation rate in the universe .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested a new criterion to isolate star - forming and passive evolving galaxies at @xmath22 in the color - color parameter space based on @xmath1- , @xmath2- and @xmath3 -band photometry .",
    "previous studies of these bzk selected sources have shown that the star - forming galaxies ( hereafter sbzks ) have star formation rates of @xmath23m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 and stellar masses of @xmath26m@xmath24 , whilst the passive evolving galaxies ( hereafter pbzks ) are found to have stellar masses of @xmath27m@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "both pbzks and sbzks are also found to be strongly clustered @xcite .",
    "distant red galaxies ( drg ) are identified by their observed red near - infrared colors , @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite argue that the drg color criterion is designed to be sensitive to those galaxies with a large 4000  @xmath29 break and produces a sample that is mainly populated by galaxies at @xmath30 .",
    "subsequent analysis has concluded that drgs have high star formation rates of @xmath31 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 , high stellar masses of @xmath32m@xmath24 and are actively forming stars at @xmath33 .",
    "the contamination by galaxies at lower redshifts of the high - z populations selected via the drg colour criterion has also been discussed in recent papers @xcite and it has been shown that the high - z drg population are more luminous and exhibit stronger clustering than that of the low - z population that is also selected with the drg colour criterion . from these studies ,",
    "these high redshift galaxy populations are inferred to be the progenitors of the present - day early type galaxies .    in this work ,",

    "recent results of a deep survey with the subaru / moircs instrument in the goods - n field , @xcite shows that the number counts of drgs also turn over at @xmath37 . although the number counts of sbzks increase in number sharply toward fainter magnitudes , those of the pbzks also clearly turn over around @xmath38 @xcite",
    "this indicates that these number counts are directly sampling the luminosity function ( lf ) at a specific epoch . in this scenario ,",
    "the corresponding absolute magnitude at the flattening of the number counts will be close to the value of m@xmath39 determined for the @xmath3 -band lf over the same redshift range @xcite .",
    "furthermore the trend of a late - type galaxies to posess a steeper slope of the lf @xcite is also consistent with that of the sbzk counts exhibiting steeper slope at the faint end .",
    "note that some studies have claimed that the ero counts are lower than those predicted by pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) models .",
    "@xcite derived the number counts of eros using a sample ( @xmath40 ) of 158 eros in the elais n2 field and reported lower counts than models in which all e / s0 galaxies evolve according to ple .",

    "@xcite show that the cumulative number counts of eros ( @xmath41 ) over a 2850 arcmin@xmath5 area within the elais field @xcite are well fited by ple models .",
    "however , several results implying a lower density of early - type galaxies at @xmath42 have been reported from morphological studies .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported that the comoving density of @xmath43 galaxies decreases at @xmath42 in each morphological category based on the results of the hst wfpc2/nicmos archival data of the hdf - n .",
    "in particular , they showed that the number density of the bulge - dominated galaxies conspicuously decreases to 1/5 of the local value between the @xmath44 and @xmath45 bins .",
    "other morphological studies have also revealed an apparent lack of massive ellipticals at redshifts greater than @xmath46 .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict a significant decline in the comoving density of ellipticals with redshift , as they should form through merging at @xmath47 and a measure of a decline in their comoving density would provide valuable proof of these models .",
    "it is therefore important to study the counts of these @xmath3 -band selected high redshift galaxy populations because these samples will provide us with the clues for the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "we describe our observations in the @xmath4 north ecliptic pole ( nep ) field in  [ sec : nep_field ] .",

    "we discuss the relationship between , and the trend of the ero , bzk and drg count slopes ( [ sub : difference_of_counts ] ) , the results of comparing our counts with evolutionary models for the passive early - type galaxy population ( [ sub : comparing_with_model ] ) and the dero star - forming population ( [ sub : comparing_with_dusty_model ] ) .",
    "as previously indicated by @xcite in other ero fields , the ero counts in the @xmath4 nep field ( figure [ figure : ero_count ] ) also clearly show a slope change at @xmath89 below which the counts exhibit a shallower slope . on the other hand ,",

    "although eros and drgs both include dusty star - forming and passive old populations , these results suggest that the red galaxies contribute less significantly to the galaxy counts in the fainter magnitude range",
    ".    the pero counts show a turn over at @xmath82 whilst the pbzk counts show a turn over at @xmath85 , shifting to slightly fainter magnitudes .",
    "this is reasonable since the pbzk criterion is generally sampling a higher redshift domain than the pero criterion .",
    "since the redshift distributions of the pero and pbzk counts are well - defined , these populations are independently selected passive old galaxies in different redshift slices .",
    "therefore the pero and pbzk criteria can provide a good opportunity to investigate the evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "we will investigate the difference between these counts of passive old samples and produce a number count model for the early - type galaxies in next subsection .      in this section ,",
    "we construct a number count model for the early - type galaxies in order to explain the pero and pbzk counts .",
    "we primarily adopt the number count model based on the formulation of @xcite .",
    "this model incorporates the evolution of the lf for each galaxy population within a backward evolution framework .",
    "therefore , we may control the evolution of each galaxy type using the type - dependent lf .",
    "the number count model depends mainly on the three parameters of the @xcite lf , @xmath91 with @xmath92 the parameter @xmath93 is the characteristic magnitude and the parameter @xmath94 is the faint - end slope of the lf .",
    "although the parameter @xmath95 is a normalization coefficient with dimensions of the number density of galaxies , we re - define @xmath95 as follows , in order to include a parameterization of evolution in the number density , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a free parameter controlling the number density evolution . in the case of @xmath98 , the number density is decreasing to higher redshift ( hereafter ` negative density evolution ' ) .    in the past decade",
    ", there have been a number of determinations of the nir local lf of galaxies based on both photometric @xcite and spectroscopic redshifts @xcite . from optical surveys",
    ", it has also been shown that each galaxy type has a characteristic lf shape @xcite .",
    "however lfs determined with optical surveys may be affected by star - formation activity and dust extinction ,    we refer to the type - dependent @xmath3-band luminosity function ( lf ) of @xcite based on the 2mass second incremental release catalog of extended sources @xcite .",
    "however @xcite point out that the @xmath3-band photometry of @xcite has better signal - to - noise and resolution than the 2mass images and enables more accurate 2mass magnitudes to be measured than the original default magnitudes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ) .",
    "we therefore normalized the characteristic magnitude @xmath99 of the number count model at @xmath100 of the 2mass counts measured by @xcite using a similar magnitude estimator to that of @xcite .",
    "the three parameters for the lf of early - type galaxies are shown in table [ table : early_type_parameter ] .",
    "we use the spectrophotometric population synthesis models of @xcite with a salpeter stellar initial mass function to compute the evolution of the galaxy luminosity as a function of the age , which we refer to as our baseline pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) case . this theoretical spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "model is ideal for the approach to number count modelling within the backward evolution framework because it returns the sed of a galaxy with any star formation history as a function of cosmic time for a given formation epoch .",
    "the basic characteristics of the sed of early - type galaxies i.e. , metalicity and star formation rate , assuming pure luminosity evolution , are also listed in table [ table : early_type_parameter ] .",
    "the galaxy formation epoch is an important model parameter , as any delay in the galaxy formation epoch will shift the count slope towards brighter magnitudes and lower number densities .",
    "it is , however , poorly understood and rather loosely constrained .",
    "@xcite reported a lower limit for the elliptical galaxy formation epoch from a study of the color - magnitude relation of elliptical and s0 galaxies in six clusters obtained using imaging on the hst .",
    "they reported the oldest stars in the elliptical galaxies appear to have formed at @xmath101 .",
    "we therefore calculate our number count models for the early - type galaxy population for three different formation epochs at @xmath102 , 5 and 6 .",
    "we first compare the calculated early - type number counts with the observed pero counts as shown in fgure [ figure : pero_model ] .",
    "the effect of the strong negative number density evolution is seen as a shift of the counts to lower number densities with magnitude . in the bright magnitude range @xmath103 , since the peros sample is small in number , the simple ple model without density evolution ( corresponding to @xmath104 ) can not be ruled out .",
    "however in the fainter magnitude range @xmath105 , the simple ple model is clearly inconsistent with the pero counts : the faintest pero counts at @xmath106 are more than 6.7 times lower than the ple models with @xmath107 .",
    "note the pero counts are higher than the negative density evolution model with @xmath108 , this is because the brighter samples of peros contain many low redshift galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the pero counts favor the negative density evolution models .",
    "we also compare the early - type number count model with the observed pbzk counts .",
    "the simple ple models with @xmath104 exceed the observed counts at all magnitudes while the negative density evolution models with @xmath108 agree well with the bright pbzk counts in the @xmath4 nep field and the deeper pbzk counts of @xcite .",
    "the number count model with negative number density evolution ( @xmath108 ) shows better fits for both the pero and pbzk counts .",
    "since independently selected passive old samples both show signs of negative density evolution , these results indicate that the overall early - type galaxy population may exhibit negative density evolution .",
    "indeed negative density evolution has also been reported from studies of the evolution of the @xmath3 -band lf at various redshifts : @xmath109 @xcite , @xmath47 @xcite , @xmath110 @xcite and @xmath111 @xcite .",

    "note that @xcite report a contrary behavior , however , their large errors due to the limited sample size do not rule out a decrease in the comoving number density with redshift . to summarize , our counts are consistent with strong negative density evolution ( @xmath108 ) in the early - type galaxy population color selected ( pero and pbzk ) sample , whiles the total rest - frame @xmath3 -band lf also exhibits negative density evolution with redshift with a best fit parameter @xmath112 .      in this section",
    ", we will construct a simple number count model for dusty star - forming galaxiesto represent the dero counts .",
    "we assume that the nature of the dero s are high redshift starbursts with their redness being due to the extreme dust extinction within the host galaxies .",
    "it follows that if indeed the deros are significant sites of star - formation then these sources should also exhibit significant emission at infrared - submillimetre wavelengths @xcite .    in recent years",
    "a great deal of effort has gone into estimations of the fraction of deros making up the far - infrared  submillimetre counts , however these estimates have been hampered by differing selection criteria .",
    "estimates of the fraction of deros in the bright ( @xmath113mjy ) submillimeter population have been made in the scuba - cudss fields where 10 - 20@xmath20 of sources were identified as eros @xcite , although @xcite found a higher fraction of 8/14 in the cudss 3hr field sources could be classified as eros . in the scuba-8mjy fields , 6/30 sources ( 6/17 with optical identifications )",
    "were identified as deros @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have estimated a dero contribution of 10@xmath1147@xmath20 ( for @xmath115 ) in the scuba - shades survey @xcite although this fraction may increase to fainter @xmath3 magnitudes .",
    "however within the bright submillimetre fields , the average source density of near - infrared selected ( p+d ) eros is @xmath11618,000 per square degree , i.e. significantly higher than the source density of bright submillimtre galaxies ( @xmath116thousands per square degree ) .",
    "therefore , for the deros to be explained by the submillimeter source population there must exist a larger contribution at fainter submillimetre fluxes , and indeed , deeper submillimetre observations ( @xmath1172mjy ) have implied a much higher fraction of eros . using the hdf - n scuba super - map",
    ", @xcite discovered a much higher contribution of eros than in the brighter submillimetre surveys and moreover classified all submillimetre detected eros as deros . at submillimetre fluxes of @xmath1181mjy , the source density of submillimetre sources",
    "becomes sufficiently high to account for all eros . to investigate the contribution of eros to the fainter submillimetre population , @xcite performed submillimetre stacking analysis of red galaxies around distant clusters finding an average flux of @xmath1191mjy and an estimated contribution to the total flux from faint sources between 0.5 @xmath120 5mjy of 50@xmath20 .",
    "similar studies have yielded consistent results with average fluxes of 1.58@xmath1140.13mjy and contributions to the emission over the 0.5 @xmath120 5mjy flux range of 50@xmath20 @xcite , and 0.4@xmath1140.07mjy , with a contribution to the total emission over the 0.5 @xmath120 5mjy range of 10@xmath20 @xcite respectively .",
    "the differences are most likely due to the slightly different ero depth and selection criteria and field to field variations due to the strong clustering nature of deros .    under the above assumptions , we model the @xmath3-band dusty star - forming ero population as a fraction of the dusty far - infrared  submillimetre population .",
    "we assume the submillimetre luminosity function of @xcite that was derived from a combination of the iras point source catalogue @xcite and the scuba local galaxy survey @xcite .",

    "the variation in the starburst sed is explained by the difference in the starburst age and the compactness of the starburst region .",
    "the starburst age ranges from 0.01 - 0.6gyr .",
    "the compactness factor @xmath141 ranges from 0.3  5.0 and can be considered as a measure of the optical depth . in order to select seds appropriate for our modelling of the dero population",
    "we identify those seds from within the spectral library that specifically have red colours @xmath1425.3 in the redshift range 1 - 2 .",
    "the selected seds for our three populations are tabulated in table  [ table : starforming_type_parameter ] .",
    "note that for our @xmath12810@xmath131 population ( i.e. ulirgs ) we adopt the model fit to the archetypical dero hr10 ( ero j164502 + 4626.4 , @xcite ) which has been shown to be a distant arp220 type ulirg analogue @xcite .",
    "using the above luminosity function and seds we model the observed counts of deros in the @xmath4 nep field by assuming ero fractions of the submillimetre population of 15 , 25 & 35 percent respectively .",
    "the resulting counts are shown in figure [ figure : dero_model ] .",
    "the @xmath0-band dero number counts are well fitted by a submillimetre evolutionary model assuming that around 25 percent of the sub - millimetre galaxy population to faint fluxes are deros . the 35 percent model over -",
    "predicts the dero counts at @xmath0 magnitudes fainter than 17 , whilst the 15 percent model can not account for the fainter dero source counts at @xmath14318.5 . in figure",
    "[ figure : dero_parts ] we also plot the individual components ( stfg l / l@xmath14410@xmath129 , lirg l / l@xmath14410@xmath130 , & ulirg l / l@xmath14410@xmath131 , see table [ table : starforming_type_parameter ] ) corresponding to our best fit 25 percent model given in figure [ figure : dero_model ] . in our best fit 25 percent model , the bulk of the brighter ( @xmath14519 ) counts originate from the @xmath14610@xmath131 population , i.e. that hr10 type deros do not contribute significantly to the dero source counts .",
    "note that this result is consistent with the sub - mm stacking of ulirgs of @xcite and the work of @xcite who concluded that the contribution of hr10-like deros to the submillimetre population was constrained to 10 - 20 percent .",
    "the brighter counts at ( @xmath14518 ) are composed of lirg sources with luminosities 10@xmath14710@xmath131 along with a non - negliable fraction of weaker l/@xmath14810@xmath149 star - forming galaxies .",
    "we also predict that by @xmath14319.5 , the dero source counts are dominated by the faint submillimetre population of moderate star - forming galaxies .",
    "note that if this is the case , then the fainter deros are examples of less luminous systems responsible for a large fraction of the star - formation rate at high redshift .",
    "we also predict that , corresponding to the decline of the brighter systems , the counts of deros should turn over in the magnitude range @xmath0=19 - 20 .",
    "in order to seek clues to understand the origin of the change in the @xmath3 -band count slope and the evolution of high redshift galaxy populations , we have investigated the number counts of @xmath3 -band selected high redshift galaxy populations : eros , bzks and drgs .",
    "moreover we have further segregated these populations into their passive elliptical and dusty evolving star - forming constiuents .",
    "our catalogue in the @xmath4 nep field contains 167 peros and 141 deros ( @xmath6 ) , 38 pbzks and 137 sbzks ( @xmath6 ) , 64 drgs ( @xmath7 ) . from these large samples",
    ", we confirmed that the number counts of both the peros and pbzk have shallower slopes at fainter magnitudes and turnovers at @xmath82 and @xmath85 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the sbzk counts show a steeper slope which dominates in the fainter magnitude range as shown by @xcite .",
    "these results strongly support that the passively evolving population contributes less to the galaxy counts at fainter magnitudes .    for the passively evolving pero and pbzks populations , from a comparison with a backward evolution model allowing number density evolution ,",
    "we conclude that the ple model without density evolution is at odds to explain the observed counts at fainter magnitudes , whilst the model including negative density evolution is consistent with the observed counts of the passively evolving populations .",
    "we have also modelled the dero population with a simple backward evolutionary model assuming that the dero population can be explained by the source densities of the far - infrared  submillimetre populations .",
    "our best ft to the dero source counts is found by assuming a 25 percent contribution from submillimetre star - forming galaxies with the majority of brighter @xmath0 -band detected deros having luminous , as opposed to ultra - luminous counterparts .",
    "with such a significant contribution by deros to the fraction of dusty galaxies at far - infrared ",
    "submillimetre wavelengths , we may expect a correspondingly significant contribution , from this population , to the cosmic star - fromation history of the universe .",
    "further investigation of these high redshift colour selected populations ( ero , bzk , drg ) will not only produce constraints on the formation epoch and evolution of giant galaxy systems but also provide a bridge to connect the optical and infrared star - formation history of the universe . a discussion of the @xmath4 mid - infrared emission from our sample will be given in a forthcoming work .",
