    ", the pion - exchange interaction appears mainly as the tensor force , which is much stronger than the central force . to make the important role of the pion in nuclei clear",
    ", we briefly discuss the role of the tensor force in the reaction matrix theory , showing the density dependence of the central component of the @xmath0-matrix , together with some discussion on the results of the variational calculations for light nuclei based on the realistic nuclear force .",
    "the importance of the pion demonstrated through those studies , leads us to develop a theoretical framework based on the mean field theory which enables us to treat the pion - exchange interaction on the same footing as other meson - exchange interactions .",
    "a new mean field theory has been formulated by breaking the charge and parity symmetries of the single - particle orbits and further by recovering both the symmetries of the total wave function .",
    "thus we call it the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock ( cpphf ) scheme , with which we study the correlation caused by the pion ( or tensor force ) .",
    "we discuss the cpphf scheme in the latter half of this paper .",
    "the reaction matrix theory initiated by brckner has been developed with the intention of understanding the nuclear structure through the multiple scattering correlation based on the two - particle scattering in nuclei starting from the realistic nuclear force .",
    "the most basic element in the theory is the reaction matrix ( @xmath0-matrix ) .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath0-matrix is necessitated by the singular nature of the two - body forces in the short range region , that is , the repulsive core and the strong non - central components .",
    "-matrix for two particles in a nucleus , which includes the effects of the hard core and the tensor force.,width=113 ]    the elementary process of the multiple scattering is the two - nucleon scattering within a nucleus which is described by `` the reaction matrix '' given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 express the two - boy nuclear potential , the kinetic energy operator , the starting energy of the scattering two nucleons , and the pauli exclusion operator , respectively .",
    "the reaction matrix @xmath0 is a sort of `` effective interaction '' in nuclei in contrast to the original nuclear force @xmath3 .",
    "because the two - body scattering correlation is known to be dominant compared with higher multiple scattering correlations , the reaction matrix @xmath0 can be a good basic element for investigating the nuclear structure with the standard models ( the shell model and the mean field model ) .",
    "according to the definition of @xmath0 , the repulsive core of @xmath3 appears simply in @xmath0 as a fairly weakened core .",
    "however , the tensor force causes the significant modifications in the characteristics of the `` effective interaction @xmath0 , '' because the effect of the tensor force arises first as the second order effect @xmath7 and produces a very large contribution to the central component of @xmath0 .",
    "the many - body effects included in the @xmath0-matrix arises only through the green function @xmath8 .",
    "these are the pauli effect due to @xmath6 and the dispersion effect due to @xmath9 , which bring about various kinds of the structure dependence reflecting the characteristics of the structure assumed initially .",
    "thus the contribution of the tensor force to the central component of @xmath0 is very sensitive to the nuclear structure itself and to the circumstance of the surrounding nuclear medium @xcite .",

    "first of all we have been strongly impressed by their successful reproduction of the binding energy of the ground and excited states for all these nuclei .",
    "secondly , we are surprised by their results that the contribution of the one - pion - exchange interaction @xmath22 amounts to 70 - 80% of the strength of the two - body interaction part in the 3@xmath23a@xmath238 systems , and the pion is also important for the three - body interaction originating mostly from the pion exchange .",
    "thirdly , we notice that the two - alpha cluster structure is found in @xmath24be : according to their expression @xcite , `` these results obtained from the vmc wave functions , suggest that the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 wave functions for @xmath28be have the structure of a deformed rotor consisting of two @xmath29 s . ''    with regard to the importance of the pion , we note here the pioneering work of the variational calculation of the @xmath29 particle by atms @xcite .",
    "table  [ table1 ] exhibits the contributions of various interactions to the binding energy ( in the unit of mev ) , from which we can see almost a half of the attraction is due to the tensor force and hence the pion - exchange interaction is responsible in alpha particle .",

    "we compare them with the results for the cases of the hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme with the non - projected variational wave function and for the case of the parity - projected hartree - fock ( pphf ) scheme with the parity - projected variational wave function .",
    "although we make the tensor force 1.5 times stronger than the usual one , we can not obtain the correlation energy due to the tensor force by the hf scheme but a fairly large correlation energy is obtained by the pphf scheme . finally the cpphf scheme produces a large amount of the correlation energy , which is almost three times larger than that for the pphf case .",
    "( see the detail results and discussions in ref . @xcite . )",
    "the studies in the model space based on the @xmath0-matrix theory and in the realistic functional space based on the realistic nuclear force , exhibit clearly the importance of the tensor force ( the one - pion - exchange force ) .",
    "a new framework is introduced to treat the pionic correlation in the extended model space by introducing the single - particle orbits with the parity and charge mixing and by recovering the parity and charge symmetries by the projection .",
