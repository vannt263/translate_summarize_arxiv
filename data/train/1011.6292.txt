    "modern cosmology is founded on the cosmological principle which assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the local universe is however observed to be anisotropic and inhomogeneous , exhibiting the ` cosmic web ' of voids and superclusters .",
    "this presumably causes the local group of galaxies moves towards a preferred direction @xmath7 at @xmath8  kms@xmath3 , as inferred from the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the overall isotropy of the cmb ( barring the dipole anisotropy due to our local motion ) provides strong evidence for an isotropic universe on very large scales . where does the transition between these two regimes occur ?",
    "while high - quality data exist at low redshifts and the cmb provides reliable information at very high redshifts , the data is rather sparse and mainly of poor quality on the intermediate scales of interest . here",
    "the sneia hubble diagram is the key source of information and so we use the comprehensive union  2 catalogue  @xcite to investigate these important questions .",
    "sneia data has been examined previously to test the isotropy of the universe @xcite and to determine whether the universe accelerates differently in different directions . recently",
    "a marginal ( @xmath9 ) detection of anisotropy has been reported on spatial scales where dark energy becomes important @xcite .",
    "clearly , better quality and more complete surveys are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn . however , although these detections are not significant by themselves , a puzzling and perhaps accidental feature is the alignment of the detected anisotropy with the the cmb dipole direction . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the alignment at low redshift is due to the attraction of huge structures such as the shapley supercluster . at high redshift",
    ", the alignment seems to become statistically insignificant but given the sparse and poor quality data , no strong conclusions can be drawn .    on small scales , the cmb dipole and the bulk flow are aligned , which is unsurprising as the common source of both these motions is very likely the anisotropic distribution of matter in the local universe . however",
    ", a bulk flow much larger than expected has been found extending out to at least 120 mpc @xcite ,  mpc , using measurements of the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect in galaxy clusters . ] which is a @xmath10 fluctuation in a @xmath0cdm model since convergence to the cmb rest frame ought to occur at much smaller scales in this model . at low redshifts ,",
    "we study the bulk flow using two different methods : first by a method of ` smoothing and residuals ' ( sections  [ sec : meth ] and [ sec : res ] ) and secondly by a maximum likelihood analysis ( section  [ sec : likelihood ] ) .",
    "we show that these two methods are in good agreement at small redshifts ( @xmath11 ) and confirm that there is indeed a discrepancy between the @xmath0cdm model prediction for the bulk flow and the sneia observations .",
    "the shapley concentration at @xmath12 is believed to be the main source of our large bulk motion .",
    "we study the infall region around shapley ( section [ sec : shapley ] ) and demonstrate that sneia beyond shapley are systematically brighter than expected in an isotropic universe ( as they are falling towards shapley ) , while sneia between the local group and shapley are systematically dimmer ( as they are also falling towards shapley , but away from us ) .",
    "this result is obtained using our smoothing and residuals scheme .    at high redshift ,",
    "the @xmath13 statistic can not be used since the bulk flow becomes small relative to the hubble expansion rate . using the method of smoothing and residuals for @xmath14",
    "we find that an isotropic model such as @xmath0cdm is consistent with the data .",
    "however , the poor quality of the data means that anisotropic models can not be eliminated .",
    "since the high redshift results may be contaminated by the low redshift data , we perform a ` cosmic tomography '  the data is sliced up in redshift and the question of isotropy is studied separately for each slice .",
    "the differential analysis is then complemented by a commulative analysis to establish the correlation between different shells .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the union 2 catalogue  @xcite contains 557 sneia of which 165 are at @xmath15 .",
    "this is the largest compilation of sneia to date from several different surveys including union  @xcite , cfa  @xcite and sdss  @xcite , in addition to data on 6 new sneia reported by @xcite .",
    "while efforts have been made to obtain good control over the systematics , it is recognised that combining data from different surveys can introduce additional biases .",
    "nevertheless this is the best data set available at present .    in figure",
    "[ fig : union2 ] , we illustrate by the size of the spots the discrepancy between the luminosity distance of union  2 sneia and the value predicted by the standard @xmath0cdm model , for @xmath16 ( top panel ) and @xmath17 ( middle panel ) .",
    "the red spots indicate sneia further away than the @xmath0cdm prediction , while the green spots indicate those which are closer . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : union2 ]",
    "the size of the spots represents the observational uncertainties .",
    "we note that there is a clear correlation between the latter and the discrepancy between the luminosity distances and the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : union2-lb ] , the data is quite homogeneously distributed over the sky at redshifts @xmath16 ; however at higher redshifts the data becomes increasingly sparse .    ) and",
    "latitude ( @xmath18 ) of the union 2 sneia , as a function of the redshift @xmath19 . at high redshift , there are significant selection effects and it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions about the anisotropy of the universe ; however at small redshift ( @xmath16 ) the data is quite homogeneous and robust tests of local anisotropy can be made.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ] ) and latitude ( @xmath18 ) of the union 2 sneia , as a function of the redshift @xmath19 . at high redshift ,",
    "there are significant selection effects and it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions about the anisotropy of the universe ; however at small redshift ( @xmath16 ) the data is quite homogeneous and robust tests of local anisotropy can be made.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "if the assumption of the isotropy of the universe is correct then any residuals remaining from the subtraction of the isotropic model from the data should be distributed randomly around zero ( assuming the systematics are under control ) . in this work ,",
    "we fit the standard @xmath0cdm model to the union 2 data @xcite , subtract the best - fit model from the data and then build a statistic to analyse the residuals .",
    "this analysis involves the following steps :    first , we consider a @xmath20 parameterization ( viz .",
    "@xmath0cdm ) and a set of sneia data @xmath21  we choose to use galactic coordinates ( @xmath22 , @xmath18 ) for @xmath23 . at low redshifts",
    "@xmath24 , the hubble law implies a linear relationship between distance and redshift so the choice of cosmological model is irrelevant , however this becomes important at high redshift .",
    "second , we obtain the best fit form of @xmath25 and the corresponding best - fit distance moduli @xmath26 , then construct the error - normalised difference of the data from the model , @xmath27 as in previous work @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the distance modulus and the relative error bar of the @xmath30th data point , and @xmath31 is the expected distance modulus in the assumed theoretical model at @xmath32 .",
    "henceforth we work with these residuals , @xmath33 , and consider their angular distribution on the sky .",
    "third , we define a measure @xmath34 on the surface of a sphere of unit radius using these residuals : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of sneia data points and @xmath37 is a weight function ( or window function ) in our 2d smoothing over the surface of the sphere .",
    "we define this weight by the gaussian distribution : @xmath38\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the width of smoothing and @xmath40 is the distance on the surface of a sphere of unit radius between two points with spherical coordinates @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 ^ 2 + \\\\",
    "\\big[\\sin(\\theta_i)\\sin(\\phi_i)-\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi ) \\big]^2   + \\big[\\cos(\\theta_i)-\\cos(\\theta)\\big]^2 \\big ) ^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , any anisotropy in the data in any specific direction will translate into @xmath34 being significantly less or more than zero , depending on the quality of the data .",
    "finally we adopt a value for @xmath39 , calculate @xmath34 on the whole surface of the sphere and find the minimum and maximum of this quantity , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "our statistical measure of anisotropy is based on the difference @xmath47 i.e. a large value of @xmath48 implies significant anisotropy . to estimate the significance ,",
    "we simulate 1000 realizations of the data with the same angular positions on the sky and the same error bars ( assuming a gaussian distribution ) , determine @xmath49 and then do a simple test to determine the significance of our results for the real data .",
    "any anisotropy in the sneia sample would be more significant if @xmath50 is _ larger _",
    "than most of @xmath49s for the simulated data . from the resulting frequency distribution of this statistic one can derive a p - value , defined as the probability that , given the null hypothesis , the value of the statistic is larger than the one observed .",
    "we remark that in defining this statistic one has to be cautious about _ a posteriori _ interpretations of the data ; a particular feature observed in the real data may be very unlikely , but the probability of observing _ some _ feature may be quite large see @xcite , @xcite and the discussion in @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out here some additional advantages of our method .",
    "first , the only parameter in this analysis is the value of @xmath39  the width of gaussian smoothing on the surface of the 2d sphere",
    ". its value can not affect the results when testing the consistency of the data with an isotropic universe , since we are dealing only with the residuals and the real data is compared with its simulated samples in exactly the same manner .",
    "second , the isotropy of the data can be checked in a completely _ model - independent _ manner and the significance of the findings can also be checked to avoid any misinterpretation of the data .",
    "third , the method is able to detect anisotropy even in small patches of the sky if there is sufficient data available .",
    "in fact our method is not limited to finding only dipoles in the sky but can be useful if there is a neighboring local void or any unexpected bulk flow up to modest redshifts in a specific direction . moreover , because of working with the normalised residuals , the method is insensitive to those regions of the sky where there is no data , which makes it relatively bias - free .",
    "hence it is particularly suitable for @xmath14 where there are rather few data points .",
    "although in this analysis we focus on the isotropic model of the universe , our method can be used to test any other model , in particular anisotropic models .",
    "we wish to emphasise the difference between testing the consistency of a cosmological model with the data , and finding the model that best describes the universe .",
    "depending on the quality , quantity and distribution of the data there may be several ( degenerate ) models that are all consistent with the data .",
    "for example , we may find that the isotropic model of universe fits the data , but that the data is so sparse at high redshifts that in many patches of the sky we do not have even a single data point , so an anisotropic model which has features in these directions can also fit the data .",
    "we now use the method of smoothing and residuals to test the isotropy of the universe using sneia data at different redshifts and for different values of the smoothing parameter @xmath39 .",
    "we divide the union 2 data  @xcite into 5 bins at @xmath15 and 7 bins at @xmath51 so as to have sufficient number of data points in each bin  see table  [ table : data ] . in each case the real data is compared with the results from 1000 monte carlo realisations assuming an isotropic universe . the underlying cosmological model is assumed to be a flat @xmath0cdm model with @xmath52 ( which is very close to the best - fit flat @xmath0cdm model for union 2 data ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : results_dipole ]    it is also possible to look for dipoles in different shells using our method .",
    "we look for a direction in the sky for which the value of @xmath53 between that point @xmath54 and its opposite point on the surface of the sphere  i.e. @xmath55 if @xmath56 and @xmath57 if @xmath58  is maximum . to calculate dipoles in different shells we set @xmath59 ; for this value the weighted average using gaussian",
    "smoothing is almost identical with the weighted average by the inner product ( i.e. @xmath60 ) that is usually used to find dipoles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dipoles ] we see the positions of the dipoles in galactic coordinates for different redshift shells .",
    "the size of the spots are proportional to the p - values that are derived by comparing the results from the real data to the 1000 monte carlo realizations of the data when the assumed model is @xmath0cdm .",
    "bigger spots indicate a more anisotropic behavior or lower level of agreement between @xmath0cdm and the real data ( the size of the spots is proportional to the p - value ) . in the bottom panel",
    "we see the cumulative results which can help us to identify correlations between neighboring shells .",
    "cdm model.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] cdm model.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in table  [ table : results_dipole ] we see these results for different shells , both individual and cumulative .",
    "it is interesting to see that the p - value drops to 0.014 at @xmath61 i.e. a clear inconsistency between @xmath0cdm ( i.e. isotropy ) and the data .",
    "the p - value increases again with increasing redshift , suggesting that we are approaching the cmb rest frame .",
    "this can be seen more clearly by looking at the top panel of figure  [ fig : p - value ] where p - values are plotted versus redshift for different cumulative shells . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : p - value ]",
    "we can see the results from our residuals analysis where we have divided the data into two subsamples  one for low redshifts @xmath62 and another for higher redshifts @xmath63 . at small redshifts ,",
    "the isotropic universe lies over @xmath2 away from the data with p=0.054 for @xmath64 .",
    "however at higher redshift this discrepancy drops to @xmath65 with p=0.594 for @xmath6 .",
    "now we use a different method to examine the low - redshift aniosotropy detected above .",
    "we assume a bulk flow and use maximum likelihood analysis method to find its value .",
    "we consider sneia at @xmath66 ( since the bulk flow would be negligible in relation to the hubble expansion rate at higher redshift ) and minimise , for the union 2 data :    @xmath67 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the number of sneia , @xmath68 is a unit vector representing the direction on the sky in galactic coordinates , @xmath69 is the local bulk flow velocity in kms@xmath3 , @xmath70 is the luminosity distance for the standard flat @xmath0cdm model and @xmath71 is the present day matter density ( set equal to 0.27 although the choice is not important since the hubble law is linear here ) .",
    "it should be noted that in dealing with sneia data , @xmath72 is treated as a ` nuisance parameter ' .",
    "we consider different cumulative redshift slices of the data , viz .",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath62 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ml2 ] we see that the data for @xmath76 ( top panel ) fits best with @xmath77 kms@xmath3 in the direction @xmath78 , @xmath79 which is close to the direction of the cmb dipole ( @xmath80 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath9 contours are quite large and an isotropic local universe with @xmath81 is also consistent with the data at @xmath82 .",
    "when we assume a bigger cumulative cut , the @xmath9 and @xmath82 regions shrink and we can see that the isotropic universe is now shifted outside the @xmath82 region ( figure  [ fig : ml2 ] bottom panel ) .",
    "we can observe the same trend up to @xmath83 where the 1 and 2 @xmath2 regions are still shrinking as seen in figure  [ fig : ml3 ] ( top panel ) .",
    "however in the next step when we consider the data for @xmath64 , the 1 and 2 @xmath2 regions start becoming larger again ( figure  [ fig : ml3 ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "these results are completely consistent with our results from the smoothing and residuals analysis .",
    "so we can conclude that the bulk of the local universe of radius @xmath84 is moving towards the cmb dipole direction with @xmath85 kms@xmath3 .",
    "our results are consistent with @xcite who estimate a bulk flow of @xmath86 kms@xmath3 towards @xmath87 at a scale of @xmath88  mpc . on this scale",
    "we find @xmath89 kms@xmath3 towards @xmath90 , i.e. our results are consistent within @xmath91 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : v - z ] , we see that the derived bulk flow using the cumulative sneia data is inconsistent with the prediction of a flat @xmath0cdm model at 12 @xmath2 .",
    "this is a slight improvement over using residuals ( where the disagreement with @xmath0cdm was at 23 @xmath2 ) the reason being that at small redshift one needs to compare the data with the model at first - order in perturbation theory . at high redshifts",
    "the comparison can be done directly between the data and the unperturbed model since the perturbations have subsided on large scales .",
    "kms@xmath3 persists up to at least @xmath92 and systematically exceeds the peculiar velocity ( @xmath93 times the 1-d rms value ) expected in @xmath0cdm normalised to wmap-5 parameters @xcite .",
    "note that the 1-d rms expectation is shown ( blue line ) in order to emphasise that statistical analyses are carried out on the _ separate _ components of the velocity , and also to facilitate comparison with the previous result of @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "it is generally believed that our local bulk flow is due mainly to the gravitational attraction of the shapley supercluster which lies at around @xmath94 and that beyond shapley the reference frame should converge to the cmb rest frame .",
    "we use the method of smoothing and residuals , discussed in section  [ sec : meth ] , to study the infall towards the shapley concentration .",
    "somewhat surprisingly the sneia data provides us with a clear picture of the infall .",
    "we take shapley to have an approximate extension of @xmath95 .",
    "first we consider all data in the redshift band @xmath96 which contains 109 sneia and evaluate the dipole which , as shown in the figure  [ fig : shapley ] , points towards shapley ( which is approximately aligned with the direction of the cmb dipole ) .",
    "while the movement towards shapley seems to be strongly favored by the data , the p - value for the isotropic universe is about @xmath97 .",
    "next , we consider the data in the redshift range @xmath98 which contains 32 sneia and as shown in figure  [ fig : shapley ] , the direction now becomes completely _ opposite _ , indicating these sneia are infalling towards shapley .",
    "the p - value for the isotropic universe in this range is @xmath99 .",
    "thus future precision sneia data can provide us with valuable information on the formation history of this giant supercluster",
    ".     is falling towards shapley in the direction shown by the big green spot ( p=0.039 for the isotropic universe ) .",
    "however the shell @xmath98 is falling towards shapley in the opposite direction shown by another green spot ( p=0.339 for the isotropic universe ) .",
    "finally we show the cumulative result in the range @xmath100  the whole region is still moving in the direction of shapley , as shown by the green spot ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the cmb dipole direction is the large blue cross.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have used sneia data from the union 2 catalogue to study the ( an)isotropy of our universe . since the low and high redshift anisotropy can in principle be of different origin , we have analysed the data tomographically in different redshift slices , and also the cumulative data set in order to trace any correlation between different slices .",
    "we have developed a statistical tool of ` residuals ' to examine the data in an unbiased manner at all redshifts . at low redshift",
    ", we have performed a maximum likelihood analysis ( which is however unsuitable at high redshift ) .",
    "we find that an isotropic model like @xmath0cdm is 23 @xmath2 away from the data at @xmath102 .",
    "although the agreement improves at high redshifts ( to within 1 @xmath2 ) , we can not single out @xmath0cdm as the preferred model of the universe .",
    "the data becomes rather sparse at high redshift and the error in distance measures increases , so the data may also agree with alternative anisotropic models .    at low redshift ,",
    "our results are rather robust and we find a bulk flow of about 260 kms@xmath3 in the direction of the shapley supercluster .",
    "we show that the union 2 data provide the first evidence of the infall on to shapley ; sneia which are falling away from us and towards shapley are statistically dimmer that those which lie beyond this supercluster and are falling towards us .",
    "we see no indication of the decay of the bulk flow after shapley which suggests that the scale of anisotropy of our local universe is bigger than is usually assumed and extends beyond @xmath103 .",
    "our analysis and results are important for the study of the expansion history of the universe and the properties of dark energy . in all sneia compilations , an uncertainty of 300 - 500 kms@xmath3",
    "is assumed for each data point to allow for bias introduced by random peculiar velocities .",
    "however when there is a _ coherent _ motion of sneia towards a specific direction , this bias can not be removed by just increasing the size of the error bar ( i.e. assuming the peculiar velocities to be random ) .",
    "we will present in future work the effect of this systematic motion of sneia at low redshifts on the reconstruction of the expansion history of the universe and estimation of cosmological parameters like @xmath104 , @xmath105 or ` om'@xmath106  @xcite .",
    "we also note the interesting observation by @xcite that observers with peculiar velocities have local expansion rates which are appreciably different from the smooth hubble flow , so can experience _ apparently accelerated expansion _ when the universe is actually decelerating .",
    "thus whether dark energy really needs to be invoked to explain the sneia hubble diagram and other observations remains an open question @xcite .",

    "<S> the question of the transition to global isotropy from our anisotropic local universe is studied using the union  2 catalogue of type  ia supernovae ( sneia ) . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a ` residual ' statistic sensitive to systematic shifts in their brightness in different directions and use this to search in different redshift slices for a preferred direction on the sky in which the sneia are brighter or fainter relative to the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology . at low redshift ( @xmath1 ) </S>",
    "<S> we find that an isotropic model such as @xmath0cdm is barely consistent with the sneia data at 23 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum likelihood analysis of peculiar velocities confirms this finding  there is a bulk flow of 260  kms@xmath3 extending out to @xmath4 , which disagrees with @xmath0cdm at 12 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> since the shapley concentration is believed to be largely responsible for this bulk flow , we make a detailed study of the infall region : the sneia falling away from the local group towards shapley are indeed significantly dimmer than those falling towards us on to shapley . </S>",
    "<S> convergence to the cmb rest frame must occur well beyond shapley ( @xmath5 ) so this low redshift bulk flow will systematically bias any reconstruction of the expansion history of the universe . at higher redshifts @xmath6 the agreement between the sneia data and the @xmath0cdm model </S>",
    "<S> does improve , however , the sparseness and low quality of the data means that the latter can not be singled out as the preferred cosmological model .    </S>",
