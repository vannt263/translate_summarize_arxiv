    "the three spacecraft forming the lisa constellation have a complex motion ( see @xcite for instance ) allowing the triangular constellation to remain approximately rigid during the annual revolution .",
    "there is simultaneously a rotation of the triangle around its center , and the orbital motion of its center .",
    "a number of papers have considered the effect of the rotation on light propagation .",
    "accurate knowledge of light propagation delays are very important for implementing the tdi ( time - delay interferometry ) technique ( see @xcite , @xcite ) which is mandatory for eliminating laser phase and similar noises . in particular , in a simulation code , it is necessary to generate time delays as realistic as possible .",
    "this is why we have carried out a full general relativistic treatment of light propagation in the gravitational potential of the sun .",
    "the background metric created by the sun is responsible for both the orbits , and the fine structure of time delays .",
    "even if the orbit of any spacecraft is taken as purely keplerian , the time interval between the emission of a photon off spacecraft a and its detection in spacecraft b must be thoroughly investigated .",
    "in particular , the motion of the target b during the interception must be evaluated with an accuracy level consistent with that of the null geodesic followed by the photon .",
    "we therefore propose an expansion of both the null geodesic equation from a to b and the motion of the target b , in powers of the small dimensionless parameter @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the schwarzschild radius of the sun ( of mass @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 the coordinate distance of the spacecraft from the sun .",
    "we intend to derive the time delay between spacecraft and the global frequency shift ( including classical doppler due to relative motion or orbital shift plus einstein shift ) .",
    "the first quantity is essential for tdi , the second seems important for technology , because large frequency shifts , variable in time over a year induce requirements on the ultrastable oscillators used for compensation of orbital frequency shifts .",
    "we propose formulas for computing the time delays necessary for a realistic numerical model and we show that in the global frequency shift , the overall general relativistic contribution ( first order terms ) is much smaller than a naive estimate would suggest .",
    "the method we present is based on a matching of geodesic equations of spacecrafts a and b , with the ( null ) geodesic equation of the photon emitted by a and received by b.",
    "different methods have been considered for computing the flight time of photons and the gravitational frequency shift between two space - time points @xmath4 ( emitter ) and @xmath5 ( receiver ) .",
    "an alternative to integrating the geodesic equations of motion is to use the world function @xmath6 developed by ruse @xcite and synge @xcite , defined as the squared geodesic distance between two space - time points with @xmath7 being the equation of the light cone at @xmath8 .",

    "was then particularized to obtain the explicit contributions of the mass monopole , mass quadrupole moment and of the intrinsic angular momentum of the rotating gravitational body . restricting to fully conservative metric theories of gravitation , without preferred location effects ( that is",
    "all ppn parameters vanish except @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , they determined the fractional frequency shift up to order @xmath18 .",
    "the authors then performed numerical estimates of the frequency shifts in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "they assumed @xmath23 on board the international space station ( iss ) , orbiting at an altitude of 400 km , and @xmath24 in a terrestrial station ; as this is the case of esa s atomic clock ensemble in space ( aces ) mission , planned for 2009 - 2010 , aiming at an accuracy of @xmath25 in fractional frequency .",
    "the formula the authors give yields all the gravitational corrections to frequency shifts up to @xmath26 in the vicinity of the earth .",
    "the above cited paper in fact generalizes the work of blanchet et al ( 2001 ) @xcite , based on the geodesic approach , who provided the time transfer and frequency shifts up to order @xmath14 in the setting of general relativity ( where @xmath27 are the only nonvanishing ppn parameters ) , for a monopole mass , without intrinsic spin .",
    "paper @xcite considered the two - way laser link in addition to the one - way laser link presented in paper @xcite .",
    "however , for the lisa mission , only single links are pertinent since laser light is not reflected from one station to another , lisa  consisting in three pairs of laser links .",

    "in fact , if the three spacecraft are required to be equivalent ( i.e. , same orbit eccentricity @xmath250 and inclination angle @xmath252 ) , at first order in @xmath250 , the distances between spacecraft are constant and the angle of the lisa plane with respect to the ecliptic , @xmath253 , is 60 degrees . however , exact numerical investigations show that second order terms in @xmath250 give rise to important variations of the interferometric arm lenghts ( `` breathing '' ) and to a large doppler effect . the choice of the orbital parameters ( @xmath250 , @xmath253)influences the `` breathing '' amplitude .",
    "a carefull choice of the orbital parameters can reduce the `` breathing '' amplitude from about 120,000 km ( for a naive choice of @xmath253=60 degrees ) to less than 50,000 km .",
    "such orbital parameters were chosen in existing simulation codes @xcite,@xcite , and it has been shown in reference @xcite that this choice is the optimal one .",

    "this small change of inclination is responsible for a large reduction of flexing with respect to the strict 60 degrees often quoted in the literature @xcite .",
    "the inclination @xmath252 of the orbital planes with respect to the ecliptic is : @xmath260 though the center of mass keeps on a circular orbit , the spacecraft stay on slightly elliptical orbits ( numbered @xmath261 ) .",

    "then , let us set @xmath266 finally , the positions of the three spacecraft at time @xmath143 are deduced from the preceding ones via rotations in the @xmath267-plane : @xmath268 at this point , we have three keplerian orbits , with parameters such that the distances between test masses are constant at first order in @xmath269 , but actually varying by about 1% ( about 50,000 km ) peak - to - peak during the year .",

    "we can also evaluate the sagnac term as the difference between the propagation time from spacecraft 2 to 3 and the time from 3 to 2 : see fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "remark that the maximum amplitude of this differential time delay is approximately twice the maximum amplitude of the @xmath272 contribution , because there is a change of sign .",
    "annual variations of the frequency shift at order 1/2 are represented on fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the contribution of order 1 is shown on fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "we have given the formulas that allow one to compute the time delays to be used in a numerical model of lisa knowing the keplerian orbits of the spacecraft .",
    "at the lowest order , we have the well - known `` flexing''of the triangle , of ( peak to peak ) amplitude slightly less than 48,000 km . at the next order",
    ", we find an extra correction of amplitude about 960 km , larger than the allowed error for phase noise cancellation after tdi .",
    "the last computed order is negligible ( less than 30 m ) .",
    "the interest of the derivation is that it includes naturally all relativistic effects ( for instance the sagnac effect ) introduced up to now by `` ad hoc '' considerations .",
    "we have also estimated the global frequency shift due to the various motions and to propagation in the gravitational field of the sun .",
    "we have found the rather surprising result that the general relativistic contribution is much smaller than a priori expectations , only due to the lisa configuration .",
    "the global frequency shift , reduced to the residual relative motions of the spacecraft , is of the order of 8 mhz ( peak to peak ) .",

    "<S> the joint esa / nasa lisa mission consists in three spacecraft on heliocentric orbits , flying in a triangular formation of 5 mkm each side , linked by infrared optical beams . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the mission is to detect gravitational waves in a low frequency band . </S>",
    "<S> for properly processing the scientific data , the propagation delays between spacecraft must be accurately known . </S>",
    "<S> we thus analyse the propagation of light between spacecraft in order to systematically derive the relativistic effects due to the static curvature of the schwarzschild space - time in which the spacecraft are orbiting with time - varying light - distances . in particular , our analysis allows to evaluate rigorously the sagnac effect , and the gravitational ( einstein ) redshift . </S>"
