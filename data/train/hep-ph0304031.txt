    "during the last few years the physics of isoscalar scalar mesons and in particular of the @xmath0 meson has received an revival of interest due to substantial progress in experimental and theoretical activities  @xcite ( for a status report see , for example , ref .",
    "originally , the light scalar meson @xmath0 was introduced as the chiral partner of the pion in the two - flavor linear @xmath0-model  @xcite .",
    "the linear @xmath0-model fulfils the chiral commutation relations , contains the partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) and has a manifestly renormalizable lagrangian . in approaches based on the linear realization of chiral symmetry ( see , for example ,  @xcite )",
    "the @xmath0 meson serves to create spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , it generates the constituent quark mass and it is a relevant ingredient in explaining low - energy phenomenology ( @xmath11 scattering , @xmath12 enhancement in @xmath13 , attractive interaction between baryons in nuclear matter , etc . ) . on the other hand , the use of the linear or non - derivative @xmath0-model lagrangian leads to well - known difficulties .",
    "for example , current - algebra results can not be reproduced at the tree level and can only be generated by mixing up different orders in the chiral expansion .",
    "for this reason , it was suggested  @xcite that the linear @xmath0-model lagrangian is modified in such a fashion that the results of current algebra are already produced at the tree level , while at the same time a clear chiral power counting is obtained .",
    "this modification is based on a unitary , chiral field - dependent transformation of the quark / nucleon field , which eliminates the non - derivative linear coupling of @xmath8 and @xmath0 and replaces it by a nonlinear derivative coupling of the chiral rotation vector , identified as the new pion field .",
    "this construction also serves as a basis for the formulation of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , which is now considered as the realistic effective theory of low - energy hadron dynamics . in the context of the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry a light @xmath0-meson",
    "might be treated as a resonance in the @xmath11-system  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for the linear case the @xmath0 can either be described as a member of a 4-quark multiplet  @xcite or as quark - antiquark resonance  @xcite .",
    "the different mechanisms for generating a light @xmath7 do not necessarily exclude each other , but could in turn be related in a way which is not completely understood yet .",
    "recently , the e791 collaboration at fermilab  @xcite and the bes collaboration at bepc  @xcite reported on evidence for a light and broad scalar resonance in nonleptonic cascade decays of heavy mesons . in the fermilab experiment it was found that the @xmath0 meson is rather important in the @xmath10 meson decay @xmath14  @xcite . in a coherent amplitude analysis of the @xmath15 dalitz plot the scalar resonance is determined with @xmath16 mev and total width @xmath17 mev .",
    "a fraction @xmath18 of the decay mode @xmath19 is generated by the intermediate @xmath0-resonance channel .",
    "the measured branching ratio of the two - body decay @xmath20 relative to the uncorrelated @xmath15 decay of the @xmath10 meson is then deduced as @xmath21  @xcite . the bes experiment  @xcite concentrated on the nonleptonic decay @xmath22 .",
    "the extracted values of the @xmath0 mass and width are : @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 mev .",
    "preliminary analyses of these two experiments were performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the relevant coupling constants of the respective two - body decays @xmath5 and @xmath4 were extracted from the data of the e791 experiment  @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation of the @xmath25 amplitude was done in ref .",
    "@xcite in a constituent quark - meson model .",
    "both analyses neglect the intrinsic momentum dependence of the @xmath26 transition form factor and , in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the final state interaction in the three - body decay @xmath27 .",
    "the two approaches  @xcite arrive at a disagreement between the analysis of the nonleptonic two- and three - body decays of the @xmath10 meson .",
    "the extracted  @xcite or calculated   @xcite coupling constant @xmath28 is approximately twice as large as the one deduced from experimental data on the two - body decay @xmath29  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the effective coupling constant @xmath30 was estimated using the perturbative qcd technique . also , the role of the light @xmath0 as a elementary particle  @xcite and as a correlated two - pion state  @xcite was examined in @xmath31 decay .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the two - body nonleptonic decays involving the light @xmath0-meson with @xmath29 and @xmath32 .",
    "we work in the framework of a qcd motivated , relativistic quark model which implements a linear realization of chiral symmetry  @xcite-@xcite . in this context",
    "the formalism also allows to describe the pion as a composite particle . to solidify and extent our considerations , we therefore also present a comprehensive analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of @xmath8 and @xmath0 associated with the transitions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath3 .",
    "the specific scheme we work in can be viewed as an effective quantum field theory approach based on a lagrangian of light and heavy hadrons ( both mesons and baryons ) interacting with their constituent quarks  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the coupling strength of a specific hadron to its constituent quarks is determined by the compositeness condition @xmath35  @xcite , where @xmath36 is the wave function renormalization constant of the hadron .",
    "the compositeness condition enables to relate theories with quark and hadron degrees of freedom to effective lagrangian approaches formulated in terms of hadron variables only ( as , for example , chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and its covariant extension to the baryon sector  @xcite ) .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "we start with an effective interaction lagrangian written down in terms of quark and hadron variables .",
    "then , by using feynman rules , the @xmath37-matrix elements describing hadron - hadron interactions are given by a set of quark diagrams .",
    "the compositeness condition is sufficient to avoid double counting of quark and hadron degrees of freedom .",
    "the lagrangian contains only a few model parameters : the masses of light and heavy quarks , and scale parameters which define the size of the distribution of the constituent quarks inside the hadron .",
    "this approach has been previously used to compute exclusive semileptonic , nonleptonic , strong and electromagnetic decays of light and heavy hadrons @xcite-@xcite employing the same set of model parameters .    in such a way we consider the @xmath0-meson as a quark - antiquark bound state of the light @xmath38 and @xmath39 flavors .",
    "we assume that the coupling strengths of both the pion and the sigma meson to the constituent quarks are identical in accordance with the linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "based on this scheme the @xmath0 meson mass is determined as @xmath1 mev , which is in good agreement with the bes - result .",
    "next we discuss in detail the gauging of the nonlocal meson - quark interaction and , for consistency , calculate the electromagnetic form factor of the pion .",
    "we then proceed with the @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes . here",
    "we obtain explicit expressions for the relevant form factors and evaluate the leading and next - to - leading order for large euclidean photon virtualities . as a result",
    "we also obtain the two - photon decay width of the @xmath0-meson .",
    "we compute the strong decay width for the process @xmath4 and finally turn to the nonleptonic decays @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "all our results are compared to available experimental data and to other theoretical studies .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we begin by introducing the relativistic quark model which implements a linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "iii is devoted to the derivation of the electromagnetic properties of the @xmath8 and @xmath0 mesons . in sec .",
    "iv we examine the strong and nonleptonic decay characteristics of the transitions @xmath4 and @xmath40 . then in sec .",
    "v we turn to a numerical analysis of the processes considered and discuss the quality of results in comparison with experiment and previous model calculations . finally , we summarize our results in sec .  vi .",
    "we will consistently employ the relativistic constituent quark model  @xcite-@xcite to compute a variety of observables related to the @xmath8 and @xmath0 mesons . in the following",
    "we will present details of the model which is essentially based on an effective interaction lagrangian describing the coupling between hadrons and their constituent quarks .    the coupling of a meson @xmath41 to its constituent quarks @xmath42 and @xmath43 is set up by the lagrangian @xmath44 here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are gell - mann and dirac matrices which inclose the flavor and spin quantum numbers of the meson field @xmath47 .",
    "the function @xmath48 is related to the scalar part of the bethe - salpeter amplitude and characterizes the finite size of the meson . to satisfy translational invariance the function @xmath48 has to fulfil the identity @xmath49 for any 4-vector a. in the following we use a particular form for the vertex function @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the correlation function of two constituent quarks with masses @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ lagr_str ] ) is determined by the so - called _ compositeness condition _ originally proposed in  @xcite , and extensively used in  @xcite-@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the compositeness condition requires that the renormalization constant of the elementary meson field @xmath47 is set to zero @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the derivative of the meson mass operator . to clarify the physical meaning of this condition , we first want to remind that the renormalization constant @xmath58 is also interpreted as the matrix element between the physical and the corresponding bare state .",
    "for @xmath35 it then follows that the physical state does not contain the bare one and is described as a bound state .",
    "the interaction lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lagr_str ] ) and the corresponding free parts describe on the same level both the constituents ( quarks ) and the physical particles ( hadrons ) which are supposed to be the bound states of the constituents . as a result of the interaction , the physical particle is dressed , i.e. its mass and wave function are to be renormalized .",
    "the condition @xmath35 also effectively excludes the constituent degrees of freedom from the physical space and thereby guarantees that double counting for the physical observable under consideration is avoided .",
    "now the constituents exist in virtual states only .",
    "one of the corollaries of the compositeness condition is the absence of a direct interaction of the dressed charged particle with the electromagnetic field .",
    "taking into account both the tree - level diagram and the diagrams with the self - energy insertions into the external legs ( that is the tree - level diagram times @xmath59 ) yields a common factor @xmath36 which is equal to zero .",
    "we refer the interested reader to our previous papers @xcite-@xcite,@xcite where these points are discussed in great details .    the meson mass operator appearing in eq .",
    "( [ z=0 ] ) is described by the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "1 . in the case of pseudoscalar @xmath60 and scalar @xmath61 mesons ,",

    "the calculational technique for determining the explicit expression of @xmath70  ( [ mass - operator ] ) is outlined in appendix  a.    the interaction with the electromagnetic field is introduced by two ways .",
    "the free lagrangians of quarks and hadrons are gauging in a standard manner by using minimal substitution :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is a proton charge .",
    "it gives us the first piece of the electromagnetic interaction lagrangian written as    @xmath73    the gauging nonlocal lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lagr_str ] ) proceeds in a way suggested in @xcite . to guarantee local invariance of the strong interaction lagrangian , in @xmath74 one multiplies each quark field @xmath75 with the gauge field exponentional that gives    @xmath76    where    @xmath77    it is readily seen that the full lagrangian is invariant under transformations    @xmath78    where @xmath79 .",
    "then the second term of the electromagnetic interaction lagrangian @xmath80 arises , when expanding the gauging exponential up to a certain power of @xmath81 , relevant for the order of perturbation theory and for the process we consider .",
    "it seems that the results will be dependent on the path @xmath82 which connects the end - points in the path integral in eq  ( [ path ] ) .",
    "however , we need to know only derivatives of such integrals under calculations within the perturbative series .",
    "therefore , we use a formalism  @xcite which is based on the path - independent definition of the derivative of @xmath83 : @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where path @xmath85 is obtained from @xmath82 when shifting the end - point @xmath86 by @xmath87 .",
    "use of the definition ( [ path1 ] ) leads to the key rule @xmath88 which in turn states that the derivative of the path integral @xmath83 does not depend on the path p originally used in the definition .",
    "the non - minimal substitution ( [ gauging ] ) is therefore completely equivalent to the minimal prescription as evident from the identities ( [ path1 ] ) or ( [ path2 ] ) .",
    "the method of deriving feynman rules for a non - local coupling of hadrons to photons and quarks was already developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and will be discussed in the next section , where we apply the formalism to the physical processes considered here .    for example , the piece of the lagrangian in eq .",
