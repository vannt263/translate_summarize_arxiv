    "dust production in the ism is extremely inefficient as the timescales for dust formation are longer than the destruction timescales ( tielens 1998 ) .",
    "thus , formation sites during stellar evolution are required to explain the vast amounts of dust observed in the universe .",
    "most of the theoretical models for dust formation are based on classical nucleation theory ( feder et al .",
    "1966 ) : the formation of solid materials from the gas phase can occur only from a vapour in a supersaturated state .",
    "condensation of a given species occurs when its partial pressure in the gas exceeds its vapour pressure in condensed phase ( whittet 1992 ) , with subsequent particle growth by random encounters leading to cluster formation .",
    "chemical reactions will further assist cluster production .",
    "the rate of grain growth therefore depends on the temperature , t@xmath35 , and pressure , p@xmath35 , of the gas and the condensation temperature of a species , t@xmath36 .",

    "this gives very stringent restrictions on where nucleation can occur .",
    "stars seen to produce dust , only satisfy the conditions needed for the nucleation processes at the very latest stages of their evolution .",
    "the main stellar sites of dust grain condensation are the cool , dense atmospheres of agb stars and the expanding sn ejecta .",
    "the type of dust formed depends on the relative abundance of carbon and oxygen at the onset of nucleation .    in this work",
    ", we use the results obtained by bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) to estimate the mass and properties of dust formed in type ii sn ejecta and those presented by zhukovska , gail & trieloff ( 2008 ) to take into account grain condensation in the atmospheres of agb stars .          all stars with initial masses @xmath40 on the main sequence",
    "evolve through the agb phase of stellar evolution shortly before they become white dwarfs . in these stars ,",
    "the sites of dust production are their cool , dense atmospheres during the thermally pulsating ( tp ) agb phase . in this evolutionary stage , stars loose mass at an extremely high rate by a stellar wind and develop optically thick circumstellar dust shells by condensation of solid particulates in the outflowing gas .",
    "depending on the relative abundances of carbon and oxygen ( c / o ) of the ejected matter in which grains are formed , different dust mixtures are produced .",
    "ferrarotti & gail ( 2006 ) provide models which consistently describe the dependence of dust production by agb stars on stellar initial mass and metallicity .",
    "they calculate the dust production rate of the dominant dust species , namely silicates , carbon , silicon carbide ( sic ) and iron , which are formed from the most abundant elements .",
    "they use agb stellar yields from van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) and karakas et al .",

    "( 2008 ) propose refined grids of the ejected mass of different dust species , for different star masses in the range @xmath41 and at various ( sub - solar and solar ) metallicities .",
    "these models predict that silicate dust is produced by stars with initial masses @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which during the agb phase are oxigen - rich .",
    "these stars are spectroscopically identified as m ( characterized by c / o@xmath44 ) and s type ( c / o@xmath45 ) . on the other hand , carbon and sic dust production is dominated by stars with initial mass @xmath46 , during the carbon - rich phase of evolution on the agb ( c stars , c / o @xmath47 ) .",
    "iron dust should be formed in all m , s and c type stars .",
    "however , only some hints of its existence have been found up to now ( e.g. kemper et al . 2002 ) .    to ease the comparison with the dust mass produced by sne , in fig .",
    "1 we plot the mass of carbon , silicate and _ other _ dust species produced by agb stars as a function of the initial star mass and for three different metallicities , @xmath48 . here we indicate as _ other _ dust the sum of iron and sic grains .",
    "it is clear from the figure that agb stars can produce @xmath49 at all metallicities while comparable amounts of silicate can only be produced when @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , silicate grain condensation requires the presence of a sufficient amount of si , o , mg and fe in the stellar outflow .",
    "these metal species can not be produced by the star and have to be collected by the pre - enriched ism prior to star formation .",
    "stars with masses @xmath51 end their life exploding as core - collapse sne . main sites of dust formation are their expanding ejecta , a few hundred days after the explosions .",
    "dust formed in stellar winds during the pre - supernova phase ( i.e. by red supergiant stars or wolf - rayet stars ) is almost entirely destroyed by the subsequent shock wave ( see discussion in zhukovska et al . 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "most of the available models proposed to investigate the process of dust formation in expanding sn ejecta are based on classical nucleation theory and grain growth .",
    "the onset of grain formation depends on the temperature structure in the sn ejecta , whereas the grain composition mainly reflects its chemical composition , which depends on the nucleosynthesis occurring during stellar lifetime ( i.e. on the progenitor mass ) and explosion mechanism .",
    "thus , models of dust formation in sn ejecta are based on specific prescriptions for the chemical composition and thermodynamics of the expanding gas .",
    "for the present analysis , we use the results of the model initially developed by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) but recently revisited by bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) in order to follow the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to their survival through the passage of the reverse shock in the sn remnant . in these works ,",
    "the ejecta are taken to have a uniform composition and density , with initial temperature and density chosen to match the observations of sn1987a .",
    "the initial composition depends on the metallicity and mass of the progenitor star while the dynamic is given by the mass of the ejecta and the kinetic energy of the explosion : the initial sn models were taken from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , we consider dust formed in the ejected matter by sne with initial progenitor star masses in the range @xmath52 and metallicities @xmath53 .",
    "bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) derive the fraction of dust which survives the passage of the reverse shock , as a function of progenitor star mass and metallicity",

    "the denser is the gas in the ism , the higher is the fraction of the destroyed dust mass .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper for more details on the model .    in what follows",
    ", we adopt the results of the reference model by bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) , i.e. the model which starts grain condensations from seed clusters made of @xmath54 monomers , assumes a sticking coefficient @xmath55 ( all the gas particles colliding on a grain will stick to it ) and an ism density of @xmath56 g @xmath57 . in this model ,",

    "note , however , that these numbers are sensitive to variations on the assumed values of @xmath59 , @xmath13 and @xmath60 .",
    "for a larger @xmath59 and/or a smaller @xmath13 , dust grains are characterized by smaller radii , which are more easily destroyed .",
    "if the sn explodes in a denser ( @xmath61 g @xmath57 ) ism , only about 2% of the dust mass survives .",
    "conversely , for a lower density ism ( @xmath62 g @xmath57 ) a larger fraction , about 20% , is left .    in fig .",
    "2 we present the final mass of carbon , silicate and other dust species ( essentially magnetite , fe@xmath63o@xmath64 , and corundum , al@xmath65o@xmath63 ) for the fiducial model , as a function of the initial stellar mass and metallicity , as given by bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) .",
    "carbon dust condensation efficiency does not vary much with metallicity , with @xmath66 , while silicates production appears to be inefficient at low metallicity .",
    "it is worth noting that the model by bianchi & schneider ( 2007 ) shows that sne are expected to produce mainly carbon , magnetite and corundum grains .",
    "this is at odd with the models developed by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2007 ) , in which the composition is dominated by silicate and iron grains .",
    "the differences are likely to be due to different initial sn models and their assumption of complete formation of sio and co molecules .",
    "while the first molecule is necessary to study the formation of si - bearing grains , the second may be a sink for carbon atoms that otherwise would accrete on grains ( bianchi & schneider 2007 ) . in both models , though , a similar amount of dust is formed and survives the reverse shock .",
    "a thorough comparison between different theoretical models is deferred to future studies .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that in the present model we do not consider the possible contribution to dust production by pair - instability and type ia sne .",
    "the former class is predicted to be the end - product of the evolution of very massive population iii stars with masses in the range @xmath67 and might provide an important source of dust at high redshift ( schneider , ferrara & salvaterra 2004 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , our aim here is to compare the relative contribution of the two main stellar sources of dust assuming a conventional stellar initial mass function with an upper mass cut - off of @xmath68 . for the latter class , there are no available theoretical models for dust production and destruction , although clayton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have presented arguments in favor of dust production in type ia sne , with important consequences for the composition of iron dust in the interstellar medium ( dwek 1998 ) .",
    "type ia sne might be relevant for dust evolution at high redshift given the recent observational evidence for a `` prompt '' component exploding in a time scale of the order of 100 myr after the stellar birth ( mannucci , della valle & panagia 2006 ) and that a sizeable fraction of stars with masses in the range @xmath69 is predicted to explode as type ia sne ( maoz 2008 ) .",
    "however , adding the contribution of type ia sne to ( iron ) dust production is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",

    "the aim of this study is to investigate the relative importance of these two formation channels and the characteristic timescales at which one dominates over the other .",
    "we take into account that stars of different masses evolve on different timescales . therefore",

    "we stress that this result is obtained following dust production by stellar sources on their characteristic stellar lifetimes and dust destruction by astration and sn shocks .",
    "the latter mechanisms are responsible for the down - turns in the evolution of the dust masses shown in the figure .",
    "the amount of dust destroyed by interstellar sn shocks depends on the age of the system : at the time corresponding to @xmath7 , we find that this effect reduces the mass of dust by 30% in both star formation models . on longer timescales ,",
    "dust destruction is more pronounced in the case of a constant star formation rate ( sn progenitors continue to form ) resulting in more than 50% dust mass reduction at @xmath171 .",
    "conversely , assuming the simulated star formation history , the fraction of dust destroyed at @xmath171 is only 20% .",
    "this is due to sfr ( and therefore sn rate ) quenching by agn - feedback and by the larger relative contribution of agb stars in this model ( see below ) .",
    "as expected on the basis of the adopted stellar dust yields , the dominant dust component is found to be carbon dust , with silicates and other dust species being a factor 10 less abundant .",

    "in fact , stars formed in this last major burst have nearly solar metallicities and their contribution to silicates and other dust components is no longer negligible .",

    "finally , we would like to comment on the so - called `` carbon - problem '' pointed out by juarez et al .",
    "these authors argue that the lack of evolution of the observed ( siiv+oiv)/civ ratio between @xmath182 suggests that the abundance of carbon relative to silicon and oxygen also does not evolve significantly .",
    "if carbon is mostly produced by agb stars , the bulk of its production must be delayed with respect to that of @xmath13-elements and we should expect to see an evolution at @xmath183 . however , the dotted lines in fig.[fig : liqsomet ] show that both star formation models predict a ( si+o)/c ratio of @xmath184 at @xmath156 , with only a mild evolution at lower redshifts .",
    "the evolution is more pronounced in the left panel ( a factor 2 over the redshift range @xmath185 ) because at @xmath186 we expect to see the contribution to carbon ( and carbon dust ) enrichment of intermediate mass stars formed in the last major burst of star formation . as already discussed above ,",
    "the contribution of intermediate mass stars is much less important when a constant star formation rate is assumed ( right panel ) .",
    "the resulting mild evolution indicates that carbon production by massive short - lived stars , progenitors of sne , is not negligible relative to that of longer - lived intermediate mass stars , at least according to the stellar metal yields adopted in the present paper .",
    "in this work we show that the role of agb stars in cosmic dust evolution at high redshift might have been over - looked .",
    "we develop a chemical evolution model which follows the evolution of metals and dust on the stellar characteristic lifetimes , taking into account dust destruction mechanisms .",
    "we use a grid of stellar dust yields as a function of the initial mass and metallicity over the range @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * a comparison of dust yields expected from agb stars and sne shows that carbon grains are the dominant dust component .",
    "silicates and other dust components can only be produced by agb stars with solar metallicities and by sne when @xmath188 but are always sub - dominant with respect to carbon grains .",
    "this is at odd with what has been generally adopted in chemical evolution models which , assuming a dust condensation efficiency of 1 for all refractory elements present in the ejecta , predict that sne dominate silicate dust production and that agb stars lead to a delayed injection of carbon dust ( dwek 1998 ; dwek 2005 ; galliano , dwek & chanial 2008 ) . * at early times ,",
    "dust production is dominated by sne as a consequence of the shorter lifetimes of their progenitor stars .",
    "agb stars start to produce dust after about 30  myr ( i.e. when a @xmath189 star evolves off the main sequence to the agb phase ) . for our reference model , where we adopt a larson imf with @xmath4 and stellar lifetimes from raiteri et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we find that the characteristic timescale at which agb stars dominate dust production ranges between 150 and 500  myr , depending both on the assumed star formation history and on the initial stellar metallicity .",
    "hence , we conclude that these stellar dust sources must be taken into account at early cosmic epochs . *",
    "this conclusion is only moderately dependent on the adopted stellar lifetimes , but it is significantly affected by variations of the imf : for a @xmath5 , dust from agb starts to dominate only on timescales larger than 1 gyr , and sne are found to dominate dust evolution when @xmath6 .",
    "thus , variations of the stellar characteristic mass over cosmic history due to the smaller gas metallicity and/or to the larger cosmic microwave background temperature ( see , e.g. , omukai et al .",

    "<S> with the aim of investigating whether stellar sources can account for the @xmath0 dust masses inferred from mm / sub - mm observations of samples of @xmath1 quasars , we develop a chemical evolution model which follows the evolution of metals and dust on the stellar characteristic lifetimes , taking into account dust destruction mechanisms . using a grid of stellar dust yields as a function of the initial mass and metallicity over the range @xmath2 and @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the role of agb stars in cosmic dust evolution at high redshift might have been over - looked . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that ( i ) for a stellar population forming according to a present - day larson initial mass function ( imf ) with @xmath4 , the characteristic timescale at which agb stars dominate dust production ranges between 150 and 500  myr , depending both on the assumed star formation history and on the initial stellar metallicity ; ( ii ) this result is only moderately dependent on the adopted stellar lifetimes , but it is significantly affected by variations of the imf : for a @xmath5 , dust from agb starts to dominate only on timescales larger than 1 gyr and sne are found to dominate dust evolution when @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the chemical evolution model with dust to the host galaxy of the most distant quasar at @xmath7 , sdss j1148 + 5251 . given the current uncertainties on the star formation history of the host galaxy , we have considered two models : ( i ) the star formation history obtained in a numerical simulation by li et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2007 ) which predicts that a large stellar bulge is already formed at @xmath7 , and ( ii ) a constant star formation rate of @xmath8/yr , as suggested by the observations if most of the fir luminosity is due to young stars . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of dust predicted at @xmath7 by the first model is @xmath9 , within the range of values inferred by observations , with a substantial contribution ( @xmath10% ) of agb - dust . </S>",
    "<S> when a constant star formation rate is adopted , the contribution of agb - dust decreases to @xmath11% but the total mass of dust formed is a factor 2 smaller . </S>",
    "<S> both models predict a rapid enrichment of the ism with metals and a relatively mild evolution of the carbon abundance , in agreement with observational constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the idea that stellar sources can account for the dust observed but show that the contribution of agb stars to dust production can not be neglected , even at the most extreme redshifts currently accessible to observations .    </S>",
