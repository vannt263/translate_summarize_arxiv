    "another natural way of probing  tunneling from the tip into the edge state  attracted a lot of attention .",

    "experimentally it was confirmed that ti edge state is a quantum spin hall state  @xcite , helical behavior of the edge state was observed in  @xcite , the stm experiments were reported in  @xcite .",

    "the latter case was considered within tll model in bosonization  @xcite and fermionic  @xcite approaches .",

    "the effect of metallic leads for the visibility of fractionalization phenomena in transport measurement in helical tll was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "it was argued there that the fractionalization can not be observed for dc currents , while information about helical tll physics can be extracted from studying the transient dynamics .    in our approach below we use the fermionic formalism of scattering states , which implies the existence of fermi liquid leads .",
    "it results in the absence of charge fractionalization in dc limit for the parallel polarization of the tip . for non - parallel polarization",
    "we show that the left - right asymmetry of the dc current , injected to helical tll , is not defined entirely by the polarization angle but is renormalized along with the total tunneling conductance , with the resulting coupled rg equations .",
    "the asymmetry renormalization appears in first order of interaction strength and first order of tunneling conductance , and we discuss it to some detail .",

    "<S> we consider tunneling from the spin - polarized tip into the luttinger liquid edge state of quantum spin hall system . </S>",
    "<S> this problem was previously studied in context of the spin and charge fractionalization of injected electron . employing the fermionic approach and scattering states formalism for the appearing y - junction </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the renormalization of the dc conductances of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis confirms previous results for the scaling dependence of conductances in the lowest order of tunneling amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond the lowest order we show that interaction affects not only the total tunneling rate , but also the asymmetry of the injected current . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling laws for the tunneling rate and for the asymmetry are different and we find the implicit function connecting both quantities during the renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> the topological nature of the helical edge state forbids the backscattering , which leads to the possibility of two stable fixed points in renormalization group sense , in contrast to the y - junction between usual quantum wires . </S>"
