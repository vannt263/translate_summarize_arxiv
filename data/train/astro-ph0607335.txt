    "`` blank sky '' is rarely truly blank .",
    "all astronomical imaging observations have a sensitivity threshold below which `` objects '' are not detectable . assuming a reasonably linear detector response , however , it is not necessarily the case that zero photons from discrete sources have been detected at a given `` blank '' spot in an image . if one has reason to believe from observations in another wavelength regime that discrete emitters are present at a set of well - specified locations , it is possible to usefully constrain , or even to detect , the mean flux of that set of emitters by stacking their `` blank sky '' locations .",
    "the prerequisites for successfully stacking images in this way are good astrometry for both the target objects and the survey images , and sufficient sky coverage to include a large sample of the target class .    in an early application of this technique ,",

    "we also explore the distinction between broad absorption line ( bal ) and non - bal objects , finding the surprising result that bal quasars have a higher mean flux density and radio loudness than non - bal objects below 2  mjy .",
    "we conclude (  5 ) with a summary of the implications of our results , and preview other applications of our stacking procedure .",
    "we have explored two different methods for stacking sub - threshold _ first _ images , one using the mean of each pixel in the stack and the other using the median .",
    "both approaches have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the mean flux density in a stacked image is mathematically simple and is easily interpretable .",
    "however , it is very sensitive to the rare outliers in the distribution .",
    "the presence of a bright source in the stack , either at the image center or in the periphery , makes itself obvious in the summed image . moreover , noise outliers can also cause problems , as a minority of very noisy images may substantially raise the noise in the mean image .",
    "the outlier problem can be addressed by testing each image in the stack , discarding sources that are actually above the _ first _ detection threshold and/or discarding images that exceed some rms noise threshold .",
    "however , the resulting mean is sensitive to the exact value of the discard threshholds and hence does not provide a very robust measurement .",
    "the alternative is to determine the median value of the stacked images .",
    "the obvious advantage is the insensitivity of the median to outliers , since the median is well known to be robust in the presence of non - gaussian distributions ( e.g. , gott et al .",
    "therefore all of the data can be utilized , eliminating the need to impose an arbitrary cutoff to the distribution . however , the interpretation of the median value for low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) data is not straightforward . for high s",
    "/ n data , the median is simply the value at the midpoint of the distribution .",
    "but in the case of low s / n data , the value obtained by taking the median is shifted from the true median toward the ` local ' mean value .",
    "the degree of the shift depends on the amplitude of the noise ; as the noise increases , the recovered value approaches the ` local ' mean , where the ` local ' mean is the mean of the values within approximately one rms of the median .",
    "hence the recovered median value can depend on both the intrinsic distribution of the parameter and the noise level .",
    "some concrete examples may help to illuminate this effect .",
    "figure  [ fig - median_vs_mean ] shows the dependence of the measured median value ( computed using numerical integration ) on the noise level for two asymmetrical distributions . first consider a simple distribution consisting of two gaussians centered at @xmath16 and @xmath17 with widths @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - median_vs_mean]a ) .",
    "the gaussians are normalized to have equal integral amplitudes , but because the first is much narrower , its peak is higher by a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "the mean of the distribution is midway between the gaussians at @xmath21 , but the median is dominated by the much better - localized narrow component and falls at median@xmath22 .",
    "if samples are drawn from this distribution with additive gaussian measurement noise , the peaks of both distributions get broadened . in the limit where the noise is much larger than @xmath23 ,",
    "the median value converges to the mean @xmath24 .",
    "the transition with increasing values of the noise rms is shown in figure  [ fig - median_vs_mean](c ) .",
    "the general shape of the transition in figure  [ fig - median_vs_mean](c ) is typical for simple skewed distributions ( e.g. , power laws , exponentials , etc . ) .",
    "however , more complicated distributions display a more complex dependence on the noise level . figure  [ fig - median_vs_mean](b ) shows a distribution composed of two one - sided exponentials , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "the first exponential drops rapidly , with a scale height @xmath27 , while the second drops much more slowly , @xmath28 .",
    "the two components are normalized so that the first contains the vast majority of the sources , with the integrated amplitude of the second component being only 0.05% of the total .",
    "when gaussian noise is added , there are three separate regimes of behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig - median_vs_mean]d ) . when the rms noise is much smaller than either exponential scale ,",
    "the true median is recovered : median@xmath29 , just slightly above the median computed for component 1 only ( @xmath30 ) . for very large rms noise levels",
    "the measured median converges to the mean for the whole distribution ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "but for intermediate values of the rms around unity , there is an inflection where the measured median value pauses at a value of median@xmath32 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the dominant exponential with @xmath27 is itself a skewed distribution having a mean @xmath33 .",
    "it is worth noting that the standard arithmetic mean is also of limited utility in the presence of complex multiple - component , strong - tailed distributions like that in figure  [ fig - median_vs_mean](b ) .",
    "even for those distributions the median is generally a better match to one s intuitive concept of the `` typical '' value of the distribution .    despite these complications ( about which we have found little discussion in the astronomical literature ) ,",
    "we believe that the median is distinctly preferable to the mean for stacking our _ first _ survey images . in our tests ,",
    "the robust median calculation produces significantly more stable results with lower noise , while giving very similar measured values for the fluxes .",
    "we are in a limit where almost all the values in our sample are small compared with the noise , so it is straightforward to interpret our median stack measurements as representative of the mean for the population of sources with flux densities fainter than a few times the _ first _ rms ( i.e. , a few @xmath34 ) . throughout the paper",
    ", we refer to the median - derived approximate mean interchangeably as the `` median '' or `` average '' of the quantity of interest .",
    "as an aperture synthesis interferometer , the very large array samples the fourier transform of the radio brightness distribution on the sky . to obtain a sky image requires transforming to the image plane with incomplete information .",
    "the 165-second snapshots that comprise the _ first _ survey are particularly problematic in this regard : we typically obtain @xmath35 visibility points and transform them into images with @xmath36 resolution elements .",
    "the nonlinear algorithm ` clean ' ( hgbom 1974 ; clark 1980 ) is used to minimize artifacts such as the diffraction spikes produced by the vla geometry and the grating rings imposed by the minimum antenna spacings employed .",
    "one consequence of this process , discovered in the course of the nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and _ first _ surveys , is `` clean bias '' .",
    "this incompletely understood phenomenon steals flux from the above - threshold sources and redistributes it around the field .",
    "the magnitude of the bias is dependent on the rms noise in the image ( it increases as noise increases ) , the off - axis angle ( it decreases in consort with the primary beam pattern ) , and the source extent ( extended sources lose more flux ) .",
    "the _ first _ and nvss surveys took considerable pains to calibrate clean bias , concluding , respectively , that it had values of 0.25  mjy / beam and 0.30  mjy / beam .",
    "( it is unsurprising that the different resolutions , integration times , and analysis procedures of the two surveys produced slightly different results ) .    while the sources of interest in a stacking analysis are sub - threshold and therefore , by definition , have not been cleaned , we have taken the discovery of clean bias as a cautionary tale and have examined in detail the behavior of our images subjected to the stacking process .",
    "we find that we do not recover the full flux density of either artificial sources inserted into the images or real sub - threshold sources .",
    "we describe here our calibration of this phenomenon , which we dub `` snapshot bias '' .",
    "the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) used to reduce vla data includes a task uvmod that allows the user to insert artificial sources into a @xmath15 database in order to test the fidelity of the analysis . since in this case",
    "we are interested in sources far below the detection threshold , a large number of artificial sources is required .",
    "the median rms in coadded _ first _",
    "fields is 145  ; thus , to achieve an uncertainty of @xmath37 in the measured flux density of , say , 40  sources requires the addition of more than 1200 individual sources .    for our initial attempt to measure the bias , we inserted one hundred 40  sources placed in a regular square grid into each of 100 _ first _ fields .",
    "this approach allowed us to minimize the number of maps we needed to make .",
    "however , this failed as a consequence of the interference of the sidelobe patterns that even these very faint sources produce .",
    "constructive and destructive interference of sidelobes led to noise in the stacked images that varied strongly and systematically at different artificial source grid positions .",
    "we concluded that this test was not sufficient to measure the bias for random source locations .",
    "our ultimate artificial source test involved placing four 40  sources in each of 400 _ first _",
    "@xmath15 datasets .",
    "the sources were placed at the corners of a square of side @xmath38 centered on the image .",
    "we then cleaned the 400 images , extracted @xmath39 cutouts around each of the fake source locations , and stacked the cutouts to find the median flux density . since artificial source locations were not screened in advance , they ocassionally fell on or near the location of a real radio source ; the median algorithm effectively rejected the contaminated pixels in those cases (  2 ) .",
    "source parameters were derived by fitting an elliptical gaussian to the stacked image as is done for source extraction in the real images . to improve the quality of the fits , regions around the diffraction spikes in the vla dirty beam ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - dr3_stack ] below for an example ) are masked out .",
    "the process was repeated for artificial sources with a peak flux density of 80  .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "the recovered median peak flux densities for the 40  and 80  sources were 33  and 60  , respectively .",
    "the persistence of missing flux reminiscent of the clean bias at flux densities far below those that experience cleaning is a surprise ; as shown below , however , this result is confirmed by stacking results on faint radio sources derived from deep , full - synthesis images .",

    "we ran our _ first _ survey source extraction routine happy ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) on the publicly available fls radio images and constructed a catalog of 1445 point - like sources ( deconvolved source size @xmath43 with the @xmath44 beam ) with flux densities ranging from 0.17 to 3.0  mjy ; we chose a higher ( @xmath45 ) source detection threshold to minimize the uncertainties on the individual source flux densities .",
    "we grouped the sources into ten equally populated flux density bins with mean fls fluxes ranging from 182  to 1300  .",
    "we then extracted @xmath39 cutouts around each of these sources in the _ first _ images and compared the true mean flux density ( from our fls catalog ) with the median stacked flux density in each bin .",
    "source parameters were derived by fitting an elliptical gaussian to the stacked image as described above .",
    "we performed a similar analysis using data from the cosmos survey s pilot program ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2004 ) , comprised of seven vla pointings in the a  configuration that reached rms values ranging from 36 to 46  .",
    "the results are consistent with the fls survey , but the uncertainties are much larger because the cosmos sample has only one tenth as many sources as the fls sample .",
    "the results are displayed in table  1 and plotted in figure  [ fig - deepbias ] . for sources brighter than 0.75  mjy ,",
    "the mean deficit is consistent with the 0.25  mjy clean bias we have added to all above - threshold _ first _ sources ( see above ) .",
    "below 0.75  mjy , however , the flux deficit changes character , and is well - represented by a constant _ fractional _ offset , with the stacked image yielding a value 71% that of the true mean flux density for each bin .",
    "it is perhaps unsurprising that the bias should change near the 0.75  mjy threshold that divides brighter sources that were cleaned during the _ first _ image processing from fainter sources that have not been cleaned .",
    "the continuity between the bias for sub - threshold sources and that for super - threshold sources suggests that they are aspects of the same phenonmenon .",
    "a connection between the bias and the depth of cleaning is well established for brighter sources ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ; condon et al.1998 ) , so we think it likely ( but by no means certain ) that the snapshot bias is also created by the non - linear clean process .",
    "however , we are clueless as to why the relationship has the particular form we observe . according to cornwell , braun & briggs ( 1999 ) , `` to date",
    "no one has succeeded in producing a noise analysis of clean itself '' , so we are not alone in being mystified . while we can not offer a theoretical explanation for snapshot bias , we will use the simple empirical bias correction : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fitted peak flux density measured from the median stack .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eqn - bias ] ) was derived from elliptical gaussian fits to the stacked images , we find it applies equally well if the brightness of the central pixel in the median image is used to estimate the peak flux density .",
    "we use both approaches below in the analysis of the quasar sample .",
    "note that it is most fortunate that the bias is a constant fraction of the flux , since that means that it can be corrected in the stacked image",
    ". that would not be true if , for example , it were a quadratic function of flux , since in that case the bias in the summed image would depend on the detailed distribution of contributing fluxes ( which is unknown ) .",
    "but since all faint sources have the same bias correction multiplier , the bias correction can be appropriately applied to the stacked image instead of the individual images .",
    "in fact , it can be applied pixel - by - pixel to the stacked image by simply multiplying each pixel in the image by 1.40 .      in the remainder of the paper",
    "we discuss the results of stacking quasars divided into groups using many different parameters ( redshift , optical luminosity , etc . ) in all of the quasar subpopulations we stack , we always detect a positive signal .",
    "in order to allay concern that our algorithm somehow guarantees a detection , we have stacked 2,412 white dwarfs from the sdss dr1 white dwarf catalog ( kleinman et al .",
    "as expected , the stacked image shows no hint of any source .",
    "the image rms is @xmath48 , comparable to the value expected from the typical first rms of @xmath49 divided by @xmath50 .",
    "although radio emission was the defining feature of the first quasars , more than four decades of effort has failed to establish predictive models for quasar radio properties . while @xmath37 of quasars are relatively bright at centimeter wavelengths ( @xmath51 ) and thus are readily detected , the radio emission from most quasars falls well below the limits of all large - area radio surveys .",
    "even deeper surveys that cover several square degrees of sky only detect @xmath52 of quasars .",
    "for example , by examining the images from the fls radio survey described above ( condon et al .",
    "2003 ) , we detect 36 of 72 sdss quasars to a limiting flux density of @xmath53  mjy .",

    "the width of the shaded bands represent the @xmath54 and 90% confidence uncertainties ; it is apparent that even this , the largest of all radio surveys to this depth , is inadequate for determining accurately the detected fraction as a function of flux density , let alone for understanding how radio emission depends on redshift , absolute magnitude , the presence of broad absorption lines , etc . for the forseeable future , 90% of quasars will remain undetected at radio wavelengths . by using image stacking with the _ first _ survey , however",
    ", one can begin to quantify the statistical properties of quasar radio emission at all flux density levels .      as a starting point we use the largest existing quasar survey as reported in the sdss dr3 catalog ( schneider et al .",

    "the pixel - by - pixel radial profile in figure  [ fig - dr3_stack ] shows a fwhm of @xmath59 , slightly larger than the size expected for a point source observed in the vla b  configuration at 20  cm . as a consequence of the fact that the cleaned _ first _ images are convolved with a clean beam with that value ; this is typically slightly larger that the dirty beam size to accomodate images observed away from the zenith where the synthesized beam shape is larger than the nominal b - configuration value . ]",
    "the shaded horizontal band indicates the @xmath60 values derived for median statistics ( gott et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the intrinsic radio source size implied by the extended emission is affected by the vla psf size , which depends on the distance of the source from the zenith .",
    "since most first fields were observed close to the meridian , the zenith distance is a simple function of the source declination .",
    "figure  [ fig - size ] shows the measured radio sizes in image stacks separated into nine zenith - distance bins .",
    "the increase in size at high zenith distances is explained by the increase in the vla beam size .",
    "since the many quasars being averaged for this measurement are randomly oriented , the stacked radio image is expected to be symmetrical , and asymmetries are explained by beam effects . both the distribution with zenith distance and the fitted size for the image in figure  [ fig - dr3_stack ] ( @xmath61 fwhm ) are consistent with a symmetrical quasar image having a mean source size of 35 .",
    "this is a bit larger than the size of quasars at the 1  mjy detection limit of the first survey .",
    "fitting the mean stack for the 679 quasars with central flux densities between 1 and 2  mjy yields a size of @xmath62 , implying an underlying source size of @xmath63 when the beam size is deconvolved .",
    "the median flux density of @xmath64 is reasonably consistent with that found for the directly detected quasars within the fls sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fls_frac ] ) , though it is slightly higher than the value in the fls field ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "it is likely that this difference is mainly the result of sample variance in the fls field . if we stack the first images for only the quasars in the fls fields , the flux density is @xmath66 , in good agreement with the measurement from the fls images .      dividing the sdss quasars into ten redshift bins ,",
    "we see that the median flux density declines monotonically to @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - flux_vs_z ] ) . at @xmath68",
    "there is a noticeable jump in the radio flux , which is a consequence of a confluence of effects driven by the sharply declining efficiency of the sdss quasar selection algorithm ( because the colors of @xmath673 quasars are similar to stars ; richards et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) combined with an interesting dependence of the radio emission on optical color ( discussed further below in  [ section - redshift_color ] ) .",
    "the decline of flux with redshift is slower than the expected scaling as the inverse of the luminosity - distance squared because the sdss sample is flux - limited and so detects increasingly luminous objects as the redshift increases .",
    "an interesting point is that although the first catalog is also flux - limited , the stacked first data are _ not _ flux - limited .",
    "all sources get included in the stack regardless of their radio brightnesses .",
    "consequently these data do not suffer from the usual bias against faint sources in the radio ; only the optical flux limit introduces such a bias .",
    "the radio luminosities are biased toward brighter values at high redshifts only insofar as the radio and optical luminosities are correlated .",
    "the correlation between radio and optical luminosities does introduce complications in interpreting our results .",
    "figure  [ fig - f_vs_i ] displays the radio flux as a function of sdss @xmath69-band magnitude .",
    "optically bright sources are far more likely to be radio bright ; in fact , for the brightest quasars with @xmath70 , the median radio flux density approaches the 1  mjy detection limit for the first survey . this is consistent with the conclusion from the first bright quasar survey that first detects most @xmath71 quasars ( white et al .  2000 . ) but the potential entanglement of redshift , absolute magnitude , and evolution makes it difficult to understand the physical implications of this correlation .    we have concluded that the best approach is to correct for the correlation between absolute magnitude and radio luminosity before attempting to understand the variation in radio brightness with secondary parameters .",

    "the absolute magnitude is strongly correlated with redshift , but if the sample is divided into redshift intervals we find that a similar @xmath80 versus @xmath87 correlation applies at all redshifts ( fig .",

    "we exclude them here because objects so selected have unusual radio properties ( as discussed further below in  [ section - redshift_color ] . )    in order to remove this strong radio - optical correlation , we scale the radio properties to the reference absolute magnitude @xmath93 .",
    "this is accomplished simply by multiplying the first cutout by an @xmath87-dependent factor : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the original radio flux density .",

    "a slight difference persists ; at least part of the slow rise in  toward higher redshifts ( fig .",

    "2005 ) are also systematically radio louder",
    ". one might be tempted to ascribe this to the use of the first catalog in selecting some of these candidates ; however , that introduces at most a very minor bias toward higher  values .",
    "only 279 of the 13,372 sources selected using other criteria are flagged in the dr3 catalog as first sources , and excluding them reduces the median radio loudness only slightly from @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "( the robustness of the median to the presence of a rare admixture of bright sources is of course the reason we choose to use it . ) similarly , excluding rosat - selected sources  since radio emission is known to be more common among x - ray quasars ( e.g. , green et al .",
    "1995 )  also leads to only a very small reduction in .",
    "we conclude that there must be another explanation for the different radio properties of the variously selected quasar samples .",
    "one possible contributor is the anti - correlation between radio loudness and apparent magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rm_vs_i ] ) .",
    "the optically fainter sources are radio - louder , even after the adjustment .",
    "quasar candidates selected using the _ primary _  criterion are on average 1 magnitude brighter than those selected using other criteria ( @xmath104 versus 19.6 ) . but",
    "that accounts for a difference in @xmath105 of only 0.15 and so does not explain the bulk of the difference between the samples .",
    "the most important underlying correlation that leads to differences between the different sdss samples is a strong dependence of radio loudness on optical color ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rm_vs_color ] ) .",
    "since quasar colors change systematically with redshift as various emission lines move through the sdss filters , we have subtracted the color of the sdss composite quasar spectrum ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) from the observed colors . that reduces the scatter in colors and makes the expected color zero for a quasar that resembles the composite .",
    "we see a striking correlation : quasars that are either bluer or redder than the standard color are brighter in the radio , and substantially redder objects ( with @xmath106 magnitudes ) are brighter by a factor of @xmath107 than quasars with typical colors .    the tendency of radio - loud quasars to have a larger scatter in their optical colors has been noted before ( richards et al .",
    "2001 , ivezi et al .",
    "2002 ) , although it has never been so clearly seen as in this analysis .",
    "not only are the red quasars radio - louder , but their median flux densities are also far higher ( fig .",

    "the increase in  for red objects is due primarily to brighter radio fluxes , not to fainter optical magnitudes ( which might also be expected if the reddening is due to dust extinction . ) of the factor of 10 variation seen in , a factor of 4 is attributable to brighter radio flux densities and a factor of 2.5 to fainter optical fluxes .",
    "note that the reddest sources have median radio flux densities of nearly 0.4  mjy , tantalizingly close to detection by the first survey .",
    "figure  [ fig - rm_vs_color ] also shows the distribution of colors for quasars selected using the various sdss candidate criteria .",
    "quasars selected using the _ primary _  criterion are much more concentrated toward the typical ( zero ) colors than are objects selected by either the _ high - z _  or other criteria .",
    "this makes a significant contribution to the radio - loudness differences between the various samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rm_vs_z]b ) .",
    "the color differences between the _ primary_and _ high - z _  samples , when folded through the correlation in figure  [ fig - rm_vs_color ] , lead to a difference in @xmath105 of @xmath108 between the samples for low - redshift quasars ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "that accounts for most of the difference between the samples seen in figure  [ fig - rm_vs_z](b ) .",
    "the radio - color correlation also accounts for the bump seen in the flux density at @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - flux_vs_z ] ) .",
    "the efficiency of the sdss color selection for quasars declines sharply in the redshift range @xmath110 because the locus of normal quasar colors crosses the stellar locus in the sdss color space ( richards et al.2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the sdss dr3 catalog contains far fewer objects in this redshift range than might be expected based on the sensitivity of the survey .",
    "moreover , the quasars that are included in the catalog are dominated by objects with unusual colors compared with the composite spectrum , since such objects do not resemble stars and so can be selected by the usual sdss criteria . the jump in the radio flux over this redshift range",
    "is created by the selection of a larger fraction of redder quasars that have brighter radio emission than normal quasars .",
    "the observed increase in radio emission for bluer quasars can be understood in the context of the unified model for agn ( urry & padovani 1995 ) as being due to a beamed blazar component affecting both the optical and radio emission .",
    "the brightening for redder sources could also be attributed to red optical synchrotron emission , but might instead be explained as an evolutionary effect where dusty quasars are more likely to be low - level radio emitters .",
    "this is likely to be a very useful clue to further understanding of the origins of radio emission in agn .",
    "our absolute magnitude - adjusted radio loudness parameter  can be used to re - examine the issue of whether the radio loudness distribution is bimodal . while all observers agree that there is a highly non - gaussian tail toward high @xmath78 values , white et al.(2000 ) and cirasuolo et al .",

    "2004 ) and our absolute - magnitude adjustment . the overall distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig - r_hist]a ) clearly does show a secondary peak , although the contrast in the valley between the peaks is considerably less than the factor of two found by ivezi et al .",
    "the peak is also at a considerably lower @xmath111 value after the absolute magnitude adjustment ( @xmath112 instead of @xmath113 ) .",
    "an exploration of the dependence of the  distribution on other parameters reveals a complex situation .",
    "the radio - loud tail is considerable weaker at low redshifts ( @xmath114 ; fig .",

    "[ fig - r_hist]c ) where the color - section effects discussed above are dominant . for red sources",
    ", the valley disappears altogether with the resulting distribution being shifted by a factor of @xmath116 toward higher radio - loudness ( fig .",
    "[ fig - r_hist]c ) .",
    "our conclusion is that there is indeed a double - peaked radio - loudness distribution for sdss dr3 quasars , but that the distribution varies dramatically with redshift and color ( and other parameters ) .",
    "the exact form of the overall distribution is likely to have been sculpted by selection effects , which must be modeled in detail before the relatively modest 20% dip between the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars can be interpreted .      historically , the strongest claim associating radio properties with other quasar attributes was the absence of broad absorption lines in radio - loud quasars ( stocke et al .",
    "becker et al .  (",
    "2000 ) showed that some radio - loud quasars have bals , although they noted that bals still appeared to be absent from the most extreme radio - loud objects .",
    "recently , trump et al .",
    "( 2006 ) released a catalog containing 4784 bal and near - bal quasars from the sdss dr3 release .",
    "as with quasars in general , most of these objects fall below the detection threshold of first , making them an ideal population for stacking studies .",
    "the first survey covers 4292 of the cataloged bal quasars .",
    "traditionally , bal quasars have been divided into two primary subgroups , high ionization ( hibals ) and low ionization ( lobals ) .",
    "the latter are much rarer ; in the sdss / first sample there are 3647 hibals and only 645 lobals .",
    "the hibals are identified primarily on the basis of absorption at 1550   , while the lobals are identified primarily from absorption at 2800   . as a result ,",
    "the known lobals tend to be at lower redshifts than the known hibals .",
    "hibals can only be identified at redshifts @xmath117 , while lobals can be recognized at redshifts as low as 0.5 .    in figure  [ fig - bal_vs_z](a )",
    ", we show the median radio flux density of hibals , lobals , and non - bals as a function of redshift .",
    "interestingly , both classes of bal quasars are brighter in the radio than non - bals .",
    "the absolute - magnitude - adjusted radio loudness  shows a similar effect ( fig .",
    "[ fig - bal_vs_z]b ) , indicating that this is not due to a difference in the distribution of  for the various classes .",
    "the lobals are radio - louder by a factor @xmath118 ( averaged over @xmath119 ) and the hibals by a factor @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "that said , the comparison to the first survey for this new large sample of bal quasars confirms the absence of extremely radio - loud bal qsos . in figure  [ fig - bal_cumplot](a ) , we show the cumulative distribution of bal and non - bal quasars as a function of radio flux density .",
    "this plot includes only non - bals with @xmath122 , since outside that redshift range the absorption lines required for confident identification of non - bals do not fall in the sdss spectrum window .",
    "it is clear from the graph that while bals are not found among the brightest radio - emitting quasars , below 2  mjy they are systematically brighter than non - bal objects .",
    "the disparity remains if we examine the radio - loudness parameter instead of the flux density ( fig .",
    "[ fig - bal_cumplot]b ) , although the intermediate brightness hibals and non - bals have  distributions that are much more similar than their flux distributions .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test shows the  distributions for hibals and non - bals in figure  [ fig - bal_cumplot](b ) are different at the @xmath123 level of significance .",
    "separate tests for the distribution with @xmath124 and the portion with @xmath125 show that the bright and faint distributions are both discrepant ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively ) .",
    "the differences compared with the lobal distribution also highly significant ( @xmath128 ) despite the fact that the lobal sample is much smaller .",
    "the  distributions for the radio - bright ( @xmath129 ) hibal and lobal quasars are statistically indistinguishible .",
    "we have also examined the dependence of  on the bal quasar catalog s absorption index , which quantifies the strength and extent of the broad absorption ( trump et al .",
    "there is a hint of a decline in  at the lowest absorption index values , though the size of the effect is modest at best ( fig .",
    "[ fig - r_vs_absindex ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that the sample of bal quasars in the sdss dr3 catalog is strongly biased around @xmath130 by selection effects that favor the discovery of objects with unusual colors .",
    "figure  [ fig - bal_frac ] shows the fraction of bal quasars as a function of redshift . for @xmath131 , almost half the objects in the dr3 catalog are bals ! the effect here is similar to the bias in favor of the discovery of red quasars in this same redshift interval ( discussed in  [ section - redshift_color ] ) . if the broad absorption lines change the quasar magnitude in even one of the five sdss filter bands , it is more likely to be recognized as having colors inconsistent with the stellar locus .",
    "this effect has been previously discussed by hewett & foltz ( 2003 ) and reichard et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we find the radio dominance of bal over non - bal quasars difficult to reconcile with claims that bals are largely the result of a preferred orientation ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 , elvis 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , most of the arguments against the orientation model to date have been based on radio observations .",
    "zhou et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued that radio variability observed in six bal qsos was strong evidence that at least for some bals , we were looking along the axis of the radio jet .",
    "becker et al .  ( 1997 ) made similar arguments on the basis of the flat radio spectra observed for some bal quasars . and",
    "gregg et al .  ( 2006 ) used the fr2 radio morphology exhibited by some bal qsos to argue against the need of a special orientation .",
    "if the presence of bals is determined by orientation , the greater radio - loudness of bal qsos implies that we are looking closer to , not farther from , the jet axis in quasars with bals .",
    "we know of no model that results in higher measured radio flux density from the quasar core with greater angular distance from the jet direction .",
    "rather , relativistic beaming should enhance radio emission at small angles to the quasar symmetry axis .",
    "this is at odds with conventional orientation models that require viewing angles closer to edge - on for bal quasars ( e.g. , elvis 2000 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that quasars with low - level radio emission in the nucleus have more bal clouds and consequently are more likely to show absorption .",
    "bal quasars may be in a special evolutionary phase in which low - level radio emission confined near the nucleus is accompanied by an excess of absorption clouds ; when the radio source breaks out to become truly radio - loud , it quickly eliminates the clouds that are the source of broad absorption lines .",
    "this is an evolutionary unification model ( e.g. , lpari & terlevich 2006 ) .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and richards ( 2006 ) suggest that the sequence from lobals to hibals to non - bals may be the result of orientation coupled with a gradual transition from a radiation - dominated , accretion - disk wind to a mhd - dominated wind ( everett et al .",
    "2001 ; everett 2005 ) . in this view",
    ", powerful radio - bright quasars have a tightly collimated polar mhd wind in which bal clouds have a small covering factor , while radio - weak objects have more widely distributed bal clouds in an equatorial , radiatively accelerated wind coming off the surface of the disk ( see fig .  5 of richards et al .  2004 ) .",
    "this is a static unification model in which the magnetic field strength ( with an associated radio source ) acts as a second parameter ( in addition to orientation ) .",
    "this picture does not necessarily predict enhanced low - level radio emission from bal quasars since it nominally produces monotonically decreasing radio emission with increasing bal strength .",
    "however , it could plausibly be modified to explain our observations .",
    "a weak radio source might elevate the disk wind above the equatorial plane , increasing the bal covering factor for lines of sight that are not heavily absorbed by the disk , while a stronger radio source would collimate the flow and reduce the bal covering fraction .",
    "any model that matches our observations will share this non - monotonic behavior in order to produce bals that are enhanced in the presence of low - level radio emission but suppressed by bright radio emission .",
    "we have demonstrated that the average radio properties of sources in the _ first _ survey area can be derived even for populations in which the individual members have flux densities an order of magnitude or more below the typical field rms .",
    "our median stacking algorithm is robust , and , following the calibration of snapshot bias derived herein , can be used to provide quantitative information of average source flux densities into the nanojansky regime . in our application of this algorithm to the sdss",
    "dr3 quasar catalog , we establish the radio properties of quasars as a function of optical luminosity , color and redshift .",
    "the average radio luminosity correlates very well with the optical luminosity , with @xmath132 .",
    "there is a very strong correlation between radio loudness and color , with quasars having either bluer or redder colors than the norm being brighter in the radio ; objects 0.8 magnitudes redder than average in @xmath133 have radio loudness values 10 times higher than quasars with typical colors . at faint flux densities ,",
    "bal quasars actually have higher average radio luminosities and radio - loudness parameters than non - bal objects , a result inconsistent with the conventional orientation hypothesis for bal quasars .",
    "the correlation between radio emission and color is an intriguing clue to the nature of our first - selected red quasars ( gregg et al.2002 , white et al .",
    "2003 , glikman et al .",
    "it suggests that a wide - area radio survey only a factor of two deeper than the first survey might be capable of detecting the bulk of the reddened population , which would shed light on the still controversial question of what fraction of all quasars are highly reddened .    the success of stacking first images to find the mean radio properties of sub - threshold radio sources depends on the availability of large target lists .",
    "as shown in this paper , the sdss quasar sample is ideal for these purposes .",
    "in fact the sdss provides much more than quasars .",
    "we are currently working on a study of the mean radio properties of sdss narrow - line agn ( devries et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in that paper ,",
    "we explore the dependence of radio emission on the strength of various emission lines , on associated star formation , and on black hole mass .",
