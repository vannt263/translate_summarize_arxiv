    "let @xmath0 be a symplectic manifold and @xmath1 a closed lagrangian submanifold .",
    "let @xmath2 denote here and further on the natural inclusion of @xmath3 in @xmath4 .",
    "the first invariant of @xmath3 comes from the consideration of lagrangian isotopies of @xmath3 with a given lagrangian flux path in @xmath5 .",
    "namely , recall that if @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is a lagrangian isotopy , one can associate to it a _ lagrangian flux path _ @xmath8 as follows : given a closed curve @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] , consider the trace of @xmath11 under the lagrangian isotopy @xmath12 and integrate @xmath13 over the resulting surface .",
    "the resulting ( real ) number depends only on the homology class of @xmath11 in @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the numbers obtained for all @xmath11 in this way are the periods of a uniquely defined _ lagrangian flux _ class @xmath15 .",
    "the notion of lagrangian flux immediately raises the following question .    which paths in @xmath16 based at 0 have the form @xmath17 for some lagrangian isotopy @xmath18 of @xmath3 ?    in general",
    ", this seems to be a very difficult question . in this paper",
    "we investigate its weaker version :    which * straight * paths in @xmath16 based at 0 have the form @xmath17 for some lagrangian isotopy @xmath18 of @xmath3 ?",
    "the _ deformation invariant _ of @xmath3 is a function @xmath19 $ ] defined as follows .",
    "given @xmath20 , set @xmath21 where we take the supremum over all @xmath22 for which there exists a lagrangian isotopy @xmath23 , @xmath7 , of @xmath3 such that @xmath24 or , in other words , the path @xmath25 in @xmath16 is the path @xmath17 for some lagrangian isotopy @xmath18 of @xmath3 .",

    "case @xmath28 is an exact symplectic manifold the invariant @xmath29 can be related to the notion of a symplectic shape studied in @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the symplectic shape associated to @xmath3 and @xmath30 is the subset of @xmath16 formed by the liouville classes @xmath31 \\in h^1(l ; { { \\mathbb{r}}})$ ] for all possible lagrangian embeddings @xmath32 . if @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a connected open set and @xmath36 is the standard liouville form , the benci - sikorav theorem @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) says that the shape of @xmath30 associated to @xmath3 is @xmath37 .",
    "rephrasing this result in terms of the deformation invariant gives us the following theorem .",
    "[ thm - def - shapes ] with @xmath38 and @xmath39 as above , let @xmath40 and let @xmath41 be the corresponding lagrangian submanifold .",

    "the function @xmath49 is obviously non - negatively homogeneous . in the case",
    "when @xmath38 is star - shaped with respect to @xmath50 , it is , by theorem  [ thm - def - shapes ] , the minkowski functional associated to @xmath38  which in turn completely determines @xmath38 .    the study of @xmath29 can also be viewed as a relative analogue of a deformation problem for symplectic forms on closed symplectic manifolds considered in @xcite : how far can one deform a symplectic form @xmath13 within a family of symplectic forms such that the cohomology class of the deformed form changes along a straight ray originating at @xmath51 $ ] and such that its restriction to a given @xmath13-symplectic submanifold remains symplectic ? to see how a relative version of this question is related to @xmath29 we denote by @xmath51_l\\in h^2 ( m , l;{{\\mathbb{r}}})$ ] and @xmath51_t^\\psi\\in h^2 ( m,\\psi_t ( l);{{\\mathbb{r}}})$ ] the relative symplectic area cohomology classes of , respectively , @xmath3 and @xmath45 .",

    "this viewpoint enables us to study @xmath29 using methods of `` hard '' symplectic topology .",
    "namely , the existence of pseudo - holomorphic curves with boundaries on @xmath45 for @xmath59 may yield constraints on the time - length @xmath60 of the deformation , since @xmath51^{\\psi}_t$ ] evaluates positively on such curves .",
    "all the upper bounds on @xmath26 known to us and appearing further in this paper are obtained in this way .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we explain below , lower bounds on @xmath29 can be obtained by  soft \" constructions .",
    "these bounds come from the study of the second invariant of @xmath3 , called the _ poisson - bracket invariant of _ @xmath3 .",
    "it is defined only for @xmath3 admitting a fibration over @xmath61 : it is a function on the set of isotopy classes of smooth fibrations of @xmath3 over @xmath61 .",
    "this invariant is defined using symplectic function theory  more precisely , it uses a poisson - bracket invariant of a quadruple of sets in @xmath0 defined in @xcite , @xcite . in the case",
    "when @xmath3 is a lagrangian torus with a choice of smooth parametrization @xmath62 , we reduce this invariant to a function @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "the invariant @xmath64 admits a dynamical interpretation in terms of the existence of connecting trajectories of sufficiently small time - length between certain subsets of @xmath3 for certain hamiltonian flows .",
    "the relation between @xmath64 and @xmath29 is given by the inequality @xmath65 on @xmath66 .",
    "this relation , albeit in a different language , was already exploited in @xcite , where upper bounds on @xmath29 were obtained by symplectic rigidity methods in a setting where the lagrangian isotopy class of a lagrangian torus @xmath3 does not contain ( weakly ) exact lagrangian tori .",
    "this was then used to prove the existence of connecting trajectories of hamiltonian flows . in this paper",
    "we get upper bounds on @xmath29 in new cases by using several recent strong symplectic rigidity results . at the same time we use new soft dynamical constructions to get lower bounds on @xmath64 , and hence on @xmath29 , in many new settings .    in section  [ subsec - pb - l - intro ] below we discuss in detail the definition of @xmath64 and in section  [ subsec - results - computations ] we partially compute the functions @xmath64 and @xmath29 for several lagrangian tori .",
