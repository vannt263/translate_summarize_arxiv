    "specifically , motivated by intense interest in manganite and nickelate - based thin films  @xcite , we consider a 2d , two - orbital ( @xmath2 orbitals ) system with the @xmath9 octahedral distortion , with hamiltonian ,    h = h_band+h_int+h_jt    where @xmath15 consists of the hopping part in the @xmath2 sector , plus the @xmath9 distortion , and @xmath16 is the multi - orbital coulomb part .",
    "explicitly , @xmath17 where the @xmath18 have very specific orbital dependent structures for the two @xmath2 orbitals in @xmath19 ( @xmath20 stand for the two @xmath21 orbitals , e.g. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for manganites ) .",
    "the @xmath9 distortion can be included in @xmath18 via an angle , @xmath10 , describing the rotation of the @xmath7 octahedra .",
    "we have @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , while @xmath26 for hopping along @xmath27 , while @xmath28 for hopping along @xmath29 .",
    "interestingly , the inter - orbital hopping has an explicit @xmath1-wave character with a form - factor ( cos@xmath30-cos@xmath31 ) in momentum space , a feature that can facilitate unconventional orbital order , detailed later in this work .",
    "the multi - orbital coulomb interactions in the @xmath1-shell are described by @xmath32 .",
    "additionally , for partially filled @xmath2 orbitals , the jt distortion lifts the @xmath2 orbital degeneracy at the outset , contributing the well - known term , @xmath33 , to the hamiltonian . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the relevant distortions of the lattice ( see j. kanamori  @xcite for the standard notations and definitions of the jahn - teller distortion magnitudes @xmath36 ) . to simplify matters , we consider _ quasi - static _ jt distortions to begin with : this seems to be quite adequate for the case of @xmath37 ( bilayer ) manganites , as found very recently  @xcite but it is an approximation . in this limit",
    ", the jt term can be written in a manifestly `` orbital double - exchange '' form  @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the band hamiltonian , @xmath15 , is readily diagonalized : we introduce the combinations , @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43cos@xmath10 . here ,",
    "@xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 now defines new , orthogonal combinations of @xmath47 in the @xmath9 structure . in @xmath37 manganites , with @xmath48 , the @xmath46 transform like @xmath49 .",
    "quite remarkably , geometric effects allow only the @xmath50 to hop : the @xmath51 remains completely dispersionless as long as no additional distortions are introduced : this feature was also apparently discovered earlier by ferrari _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in the limit @xmath52 , ( as in effective fm kondo lattice models for manganites in the large - j@xmath53 limit  @xcite )",
    "the interaction terms can be easily re - expressed in terms of the @xmath46 as @xmath54 while the hopping part is simply @xmath55 .",
    "results for the original two - band hubbard model with @xmath1-wave hybridisation are readily obtained by undoing the transformation from @xmath47 to @xmath56 fermions .",
    "interestingly enough , this is just the @xmath57 falicov - kimball ( fk ) model , as long as the jt term is neglected , and the hopping is uniform , i.e , when @xmath58 , a constant .",
    "otherwise , one has an fk model with bond - dependent hopping , @xmath59 . following this , incorporating a holstein - like electron - lattice @xmath60 interaction in our case",
    "will obviously further enhance the fk - like nature of our model : the dispersionless @xmath61 states above will now favor polaron formation , even for much more modest e - l coupling .",
    "the dispersive band ( @xmath62 ) will be moderately narrowed by electron - lattice interaction , and this effect can be subsumed into a renormalised hopping strength in @xmath63 above . in other words , we do _ not _ need strong electron - lattice coupling , in accord with experimental indications for cubic manganites  @xcite .",
    "geometrical effects leading to drastic reduction in band - width for a subset of orbital states will allow polaron formation even for modsest @xmath64 coupling .",
    "the new element in our work is that the one - electron hopping explicitly shows up in the dependence on the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt ( @xmath10 ) in a simple way .",
    "variation of @xmath10 will thus lead to a ( continuous ) variation of @xmath65 in our fkm , whence the exciting new possibility of a mott transition driven by octahedral tilt reveals itself in the form of a bandwidth - controlled mott transition . in the rest of this work",
    ", we will use multi - orbital dmft to solve @xmath63 and discuss the interesting manifestations of this effect in the cases outlined in the introduction .",
    "many interesting trends in ground states and physical responses are now readily manifest . to this end , it is helpful to look at a generic situation , which we do by replacing the actual tight - binding dos for the @xmath2 orbitals above by a simple bethe lattice dos .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the fkm shows a continuous mott ( metal - insulator ) transition as @xmath66 is varied through a critical value . for the spinless fkm ( corresponding to the saturated half - metal with full ferromagnetic spin polarization due to an effective @xmath67  @xcite ) on the bethe lattice , the critical @xmath68 is @xmath69 with @xmath70 $ ] , for @xmath71 , corresponding to antiferrodistortive octahedral tilt commonly expected in many tmos .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath68 , increasing the @xmath9 tilt _ reduces _",
    "@xmath72 , driving a mott metal - insulator transition as a function of the _ tilt angle _ ,",
    "@xmath10 ! this can readily be induced by applying pressure , or from coupling to substrate - induced _ strain _ ( see below ) .",
    "increasing @xmath10 also reduces the af transition temperature : remarkably , at strong coupling , @xmath73 decreases in tandem with _",
    "stabilization _ of the mott insulator . at weak - coupling , @xmath74exp@xmath75 $ ] within hf - rpa , giving a qualitatively different scaling of @xmath76 .",
    "the orbital ordering scales also follow similar laws , @xmath77 for large @xmath68 and @xmath78exp@xmath79 $ ] for small @xmath68 .",
    "we thus suggest that studying the pressure or strain dependence of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( by varying the @xmath12 cation in abo@xmath0 perovskites ) can yield direct information concerning the degree of electronic correlations ( large or small @xmath82 ) and the itinerant vis - a - vis mottness nature of magnetism in @xmath1-band magnetic oxides .",
    "the above is very simply understood by noticing that the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt acts like a `` reverse double exchange '' - increasing @xmath10 reduces @xmath83 , disfavoring the metallic state and ferromagnetism , but favoring af - oo mott insulators .",
    "also , in half - metals , it now turns out that incorporating this _ structural _ de into the conventional anderson - hasegawa  @xcite argument gives @xmath84 , revealing the interplay between the structural ( reverse , @xmath85 ) and conventional de ( @xmath86 ) in a very transparent way .",
    "incorporation of the all - pervasive structural ( gdfeo@xmath0 ) tilt as a generalized principle , i.e , a `` reverse '' de has not been previously realised , to our best knowledge . the major technincal advantage of our analysis is thus that such effects can now be easily incorporated into modern correlated electronic structure ( lda+dmft ) approaches as multi - orbital hubbard models with bond - dependent hoppings .    clearly , _ decreasing",
    "_ tilt now favors the fm - metal , self - consistently _ reducing _ the jt distortion via enhanced itinerance . increasing @xmath10 counteracts this tendency , reducing the hopping , favoring oo and jt distorted across the @xmath87 with @xmath88 , one should find af mott insulators ( large @xmath10 ) giving way to correlated metals ( smaller @xmath10 ) as @xmath12 is varied : indeed , this fully accords with data , where precisely such a correlation between the magnitude of the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt and evolution of electrical properties ( metal or insulator ) is known  @xcite .",
    "further , the `` puzzling '' weakening of af order along with stabilisation of the mott insulator in @xmath89 also falls out rather naturally as discussed above .",
    "we emphasise that , in the above , the effective parameters , @xmath90 in our fkm include various structural ( one - electron bands ) , chemical ( in the effective value of @xmath91 , reflecting strong covalent @xmath92 overlap in late tmo via @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the one - electron hybridization and @xmath95 is the charge transfer energy ) as well as interaction ( @xmath96 and jt couplings ) in a simple effective model .",
    "this enabled us to understand global trends in evolution of ordered ground states and electrical properties without explicitly referring to material - dependent microscopic band structural details of specific tmo with partially - filled @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "thus , our derivation of the structural de and conclusions following from its interplay with conventional de have a more general validity , as exemplified by good qualitative agreement discussed above .",
    "thus , we identify the competition between the structural `` reverse '' de and conventional de as the central factor influencing the range of tunable ground states in cubic tmo . however , much work remains to be carried out when one inquires about the role of the above competition in strained thin films ( or devices made from sandwiches of such films ) involving @xmath11 perovskites , e.g lsmo / sto  @xcite or lno / lao interfaces  @xcite .",
    "we now apply the ideas discussed in the introduction and developed in the preceding sections to a very contemporary problem in tmo thin films .",
    "namely , we will consider the following issue , albeit with a simplified model band structure :    imagine a situation where an atomically thick layer of a tmo , e.g , a manganite or a nickelate , deposited on an appropriately terminated substrate , e.g , ( 001 ) face of srtio@xmath0 or laalo@xmath0 ( present advances in technology make this exciting situation possible , and , moreover , the thickness can be varied between one and several tmo layers ) .",
    "in this situation , several new features , not important for bulk tmo , become relevant .",
    "the excitement in this field stems from the belief that these allow for additional `` knobs '' to tune the interplay between various microscopic physical processes , and open the door to engineering desired ground states , which can be further manipulated by small changes in external parameters , i.e , _ by slowly turning the knob_. we list these features :    \\(i ) depending upon the substrate , interfacial strain can be manipulated to be either tensile or compressive . in an @xmath2-orbital based system , this modifies the multi - orbital one - electron hoppings , as well as the jahn - teller splittings . assuming a ( 001 ) growth direction and defining the inlayer strain by @xmath97 with @xmath98 the lattice constants of the manganite film and the substrate",
    ", @xmath99 corresponds to tensile ( compressive ) strain .",
    "the strain along @xmath100-axis , @xmath101 with @xmath102 being the poisson ratio . for manganites , we choose @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is the same strategy as that employed recently by baena _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and has a number of interesting consequences relevant to our study :    \\(a ) strain modifies the nearest neighbor hopping integral as @xmath105 , leading to reduction ( enhancement ) of itinerance for tensile ( compressive ) strain .",
    "\\(b ) tensile strain lowers the on - site energy of the @xmath106 orbital ( @xmath107 ) relative to that of @xmath108 , denoted @xmath109 , while compressive strain does the opposite , i.e , it effectively modifies the magnitude _ and _ sign of the jt distortion .",
    "this effect is modelled by a term , @xmath110 in our original hamiltonian . written in terms of the @xmath111 ,",
    "it is exactly of the form of @xmath112 .",
    "the important difference is that the _ sign _ of this _ strain induced _",
    "`` jt''-like distortion can be opposite to that of the usual jt coupling .",
    "it is also known that the magnitude of the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt controls ( for example , by choosing the @xmath12 atom in amno@xmath0 ) the magnitude of the usual jt interaction , even for bulk @xmath113 manganites : the same must then hold for manganite films as well . also , epitaxial constraints at the interface must lead to octahedral tilts ( @xmath10 ) notably different from their values in the bulk . as we have seen above , this acts like a `` reverse '' de , and , by itself , affects the electronic bandwidths and jahn - teller splittings , as discussed in detail for the case of bulk amno@xmath0 . the points ( a ) and ( b ) above clearly illustrate how both , the one - electron hoppings _ and _ the _ net _ value of the jt coupling , are rather sensitive to the combined effects of the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt and strain .",
    "\\(ii ) strong local multi - orbital coulomb interactions are known to be ubiquitous in tmo , and correlation effects in thin layers are known to be generically enhanced compared to the bulk , due to reduction of screening .",
    "it is very natural to expect that all these features will play an important role when one studies the ground state(s ) and associated phase transition(s ) between them as tuning parameters like strain or composition are varied .",
    "we will consider tmo thin films ( e.g , manganite layer on sto substrate ) in some detail in this context in what follows .",
    "we consider the more realistic _",
    "spinful _ two - orbital hubbard model defined in the previous section .",
    "our main focus will be on how the electronic properties of the layer can be sensitively switched by strain engineering , and , in general , by any perturbation which affects the interplay between structural ( gdfeo@xmath0 tilt , jt coupling ) , itinerant ( one - electron hoppings via gdfeo@xmath0 tilt ) and strong multi - orbital hubbard interactions .",
    "we will also qualitatively discuss their effects on the relative stability of competing magnetic and orbital ordered states , and the broader relevance of our analysis here to other interesting issues that have been the recent focus of attention in tmo heterostructures and thin films .",
    "the two - band hubbard model for a single - layer , written in terms of the @xmath111 combinations , becomes the spin-@xmath114 fkm with an additional jt term    @xmath115    as described earlier .",
    "the jt coupling is taken to be @xmath116 and not @xmath117 , as before , to signify that this quantity will be renormalised by strain , as discussed above .",
    "we re - emphasise that , in our effective @xmath57 fkm , even a modest electron - lattice interaction now drives the system to the anti - adiabatic regime ( @xmath118 ) in the @xmath119-sector , while , due to a wide band width ( @xmath120  ev ) of the @xmath121 , the adiabatic limit is applicable in the latter case .",
    "this is intrinsically an orbital - selective electron - lattice coupling , a new feature rigorously demonstrated in our case at the level of a tight - binding band structure ( the fact that a very similar tight - binding fit , though with different features , works very well for cubic manganites , at least in the fm metallic phase , was shown earlier and utilised in a dmft calculation  @xcite ) .",
    "our new effective picture is thus of immobile small polarons in @xmath61 states co - existing with comparatively wide - band dispersive @xmath62 electronic states . for the wide ( @xmath121)-sector",
    ", the adiabatic limit implies that we may consider the effect of the @xmath122 term within the quasi - static approximation ( neglecting @xmath123 , since , in this limit , the holstein problem reduces to a separate falicov - kimball model  @xcite ) , and this additional fk interaction , @xmath124 can be lumped together with the @xmath125 in @xmath126 above .",
    "thus , we are now left with having to analyse the hamiltonian @xmath126 . due to the fact that the term @xmath122 mixes the @xmath56 states at one - electron level",
    ", we have to solve a two - orbital extended anderson lattice model .",
    "to study the questions posed in this work , we solve @xmath126 within multi - orbital dynamical mean field theory ( mo - dmft ) , using the mo - iterated perturbation theory ( mo - ipt ) as the impurity solver in dmft .",
    "a wide range of impurity solvers can be used in this context : these range from diagrammatic ones like ipt  @xcite , non - crossing approximation ( nca )  @xcite , local moment approximation ( lma  @xcite , to numerical exact diagonalisation ( ed )  @xcite , continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc )  @xcite and numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite .",
    "both approaches yield the correct correlated landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) correlated metallic state and first - order mott transition in the one - band hubbard model as well as the selective - mott transitions accompanied by bad - metallic incoherent non - lfl metallic states in correlated multi - band systems  @xcite , though , to our klnowledge , only nrg achieves the necessary accuracy required to extract the ( almost ) exact kondo scale .",
    "diagrammatic approaches have the advantage of being relatively easy to implement , and work at all temperatures : these advantages are not shared by the more exact purely numerical approaches . in view of the ability of mo - ipt to access",
    "_ both _ , the selective - mott incoherent metal and the mott transition , we use it in this work .",
    "the technical details have already been worked out in detail in previous work  @xcite , and we refer those interested in the details to these papers .",
    "we now describe our results . we choose @xmath91 to have a non - interacting bandwidth @xmath127  ev for the @xmath121 fermions .",
    "as mentioned , we denote the _ net _ jt coupling strength by @xmath116 . assuming quasi - static jt distortions , the jt - term in @xmath126 is quadratic in the @xmath46 , and is diagonalised along with the free part of the band structure to yield two bands    e_+(*k*)=_*k*+    and    e_-(*k*)=_*k*-    where @xmath128 are parameters chosen to be @xmath129  ev as representative values , with the understanding that their _ renormalised _",
    "( by multi - orbital correlations and gdfeo@xmath0 tilt ) values will be very different , as we will show by explicit computation below .",
    "the local hubbard @xmath82 is chosen to be @xmath130  ev , so that , with a @xmath131  ev , we have @xmath132  ev . the hopping strength is varied either by varying the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt angle ( @xmath10 ) or strain .",
    "we keep in mind that , for the hopping between planar @xmath106 orbital states , tensile strain is `` equivalent '' to enhanced octahedral tilt and reduced itinerance , while compressive strain corresponds to reduced tilt and enhancement of itinerance .",
    "thus , as predicted in earlier sections , a strain - induced insulator - metal transition can be driven as a bandwidth - controlled mott transition .",
    "investigation into details of this mott transition , however , throw up surprises we describe below in detail .",
    "= 160@xmath133 , right inset @xmath10=170@xmath133 , and left inset @xmath10=180@xmath133 ) .",
    "the different colors represent different bands as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the tight - binding band ( tbb ) dos with two bands @xmath134 , and the corresponding one - electron dos in the @xmath46 basis as a function of @xmath10 , wherein the direct link between itinerance and octahedral tilt is manifest as a reduction of the tbb width with increasing tilt .",
    "the fermi energy ( @xmath135 ) is chosen to be at @xmath136 , defining a total band - filling , @xmath137 .",
    "it is clear that the van - hove singular ( vhs ) feature of the @xmath121-fermion band is pinned to @xmath135 , hinting at an intrinsic tendency toward instability to orbital density - wave ( odw ) order , which could then _ co - exist _ with ferromagnetism .",
    "this could be reasoned within a weak - coupling , itinerant limit ( small @xmath138 ) , as well as in the strong coupling regime .",
    "however , observation of half - metallic behavior , as in the cmr manganites , constrains one to use the latter route , as the strong @xmath139 , implies evel larger @xmath140 from @xmath1-shell quantum chemistry .",
    "generic observation of insulating or bad - metallic states in such systems is additional evidence for strong coupling physics . in this latter limit ,",
    "one expects increasing importance of coupled orbital - spin superexchange processes , rather than the vhs , for instabilities toward odw states .",
    "finally , it is important to notice that the @xmath1-wave inter - band hybridization ( in the original ( @xmath47 ) fermions ) is also reduced with increasing gdfeo@xmath0 tilt : this will turn out to be useful later .",
    "we now describe the effects of sizable local electronic correlations in detail . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the orbital - resolved ( dmft ) many - body density - of - states ( dos ) as a function of @xmath10 . several interesting features",
    "stand out clearly :    \\(i ) for maximal @xmath141 , we find metallic behavior , though without lfl quasiparticles .",
    "increasing gdfeo@xmath142 tilt ( reducing @xmath10 ) reduces @xmath91 , favoring increased ( high - energy ) incoherence , and the bad - metal undergoes a _ continuous _ mott transition to a mott - hubbard insulator for @xmath143 . as surmised above",
    ", this is a band - width controlled mott transition .",
    "starting from the mott insulator , increasing pressure now generically reduces @xmath10 , driving a continuous mott transition to a bad - metal accompanied by reduction of the _ renormalised _ jt - distortion .",
    "quite interestingly , precisely this is known to occur in lamno@xmath142 under high pressure , and has been investigated by held _ et al . _",
    "@xcite within lda+dmft .",
    "we predict that a simlar transition should obtain in bilayer manganites ( or thin films ) under suitable `` pressure '' .",
    "\\(ii ) in sharp contrast with the cubic manganites , however , the low-@xmath144 ( fm in the de case with large @xmath145 for mono- or bilayer manganites  @xcite ) metallic state we find has no stable lfl quasiparticles .",
    "rather , our dmft spectra clearly show a low - energy continuum extending up to high energies @xmath146 .",
    "this means that the green functions show branch - cut behavior , rather than a renormalised pole structure , in the complex energy plane .",
    "remarkably , this non - lfl behavior ( of the @xmath121-band dos ) goes in tandem with a clear and strong tendency to ( selective ) mott localisation of the @xmath119 band ( this is most clearly seen for the @xmath147 result in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "examination of the orbital - resolved self - energies sheds more light on this phenomenon , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : for the metallic cases ( @xmath148 ) , re@xmath149 shows sizably enhanced values near @xmath150 , implying heavily renormalised lfl quasiparticles , while re@xmath151 shows a clear kink at @xmath135 , implying divergent effective mass .",
    "correspondingly , im@xmath152 with @xmath153 at low energy , invalidating the lfl description of the metal . in the mott insulator",
    ", im@xmath151 clearly shows the ( expected ) pole at @xmath154 .",
    "thus , our dmft results describe an effective `` two - fluid '' situation , wherein mott -localized @xmath119 orbital states co - exist with ( incoherent ) `` metallic '' @xmath121 orbital states in the bad metal .",
    "this implies that though odw - like states can be found in weak - coupling descriptions , the selective - mott metal lies outside their scope , and only exists in the sizable correlation regime .",
    "finally , the anomalous behavior of the propagators and self - energies can only arise as consequences of strong _ dynamical _ correlations , and are out of scope of lda+u - type approximations .",
    "\\(iii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we exhibit the dmft one - particle spectral function , @xmath155im@xmath156 for two values of the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt angle .",
    "the extinction of the quasi - coherent lfl pole in the one - particle green function directly translates into @xmath157 a power - law suppression in arpes intensity as @xmath158 . due to the @xmath1-wave form factor of the inter - orbital hybridization ( which enters the unperturbed band structure of the two - band model ) , this suppression is also @xmath159-dependent : arpes lineshapes show maximal suppression for @xmath159 along @xmath160 and clear @xmath161-dependent anisotropy .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the complete suppression of the quasiparticle weight ( @xmath162 ) , as is clear from appearance of non - analyticities in re@xmath163 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath164 now has _ zeros _ instead of poles at @xmath136 also implies that the unperturbed fermi surface undergoes a non - perturbative reconstruction : only the @xmath121-fermions now contribute to the luttinger count .",
    "@xmath165 as the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt angle is reduced , a clear transfer of spectral weight to high energies shows up as appearance of a marked shoulder around @xmath166  ev for @xmath147 but not for @xmath141 .",
    "its lack of momentum dependence , in strong contrast to that of the low - energy part , is instructive : reducing @xmath10 increases @xmath167 , transferring low - energy spectral weight to higher energy which , clearly , must be associated with dispersionless hubbard band - like states .",
    "these observations are interesting in the context of studying latent electronic instabilities of tmo thin films : even in cases where the corresponding bulk systems show `` uninteresting '' paramagnetic metallic behavior  @xcite , it may be possible to generate even analogues of high - t@xmath4 cuprates for thin films by appropriate strain tuning . explicitly , metallic lanio@xmath0 thin films with appropriate misfit strain have been theoretically predicted to lie close to fermi surface instabilities .",
    "it is very conceivable that increase in effective @xmath168 via manipulation of the tilt angle due to epitaxial constraints can produce an osmt . if the reconstructed fermi surface shows features propitious for electronic instabilities , a range of unconventional order(s ) could result .",
    "such a `` strange '' metallic phase as we find here , with associated topological fermi surface reconstruction(s ) , would be quite interesting , since it would open up avenues for observation of exotic concepts like fractionalized fermi liquid phases in tmo thin film and superlattices context .",
    "\\(iv ) the microscopic origin of the bad metallic behavior is revealed upon closer analysis : once the @xmath119-fermions are mott - localized in dmft , the effective problem is that of the @xmath121-fermions scattering off mott - localized @xmath119-fermion states . in the local `` impurity '' problem in dmft , this maps _ exactly _ to the inverse of the seminal anderson - nozieres - de dominicis x - ray - edge problem ( this has been first recognized by anderson in the context of the strange - metal phase in cuprates ) , wherein the infra - red power - law singular feature arises due to the `` inverse '' orthogonality catastrophe ( oc ) .",
    "now , im@xmath169 , in full accord with dmft results .",
    "identification with the x - ray edge problem has further interesting consequences .",
    "it implies that the local inter - orbital `` excitonic '' susceptibility also has infra - red power - law continuum behavior :    @xmath170    hence , in the selective metal , orbital - excitons are not well - defined elementary excitations ( as they would be if the metal were a lfl ) . instead of the conventional long - lived particle - hole modes ( i.e , a low energy coherent plasmon plus shake - up features at higher energy in the lfl ) , the low - energy spectrum is characteristic of a critical orbital _ liquid _ , in analogy with characterisation of spin - liquids : the particle - hole spectrum is a critical ( power - law ) continuum of `` exciton - like '' origin extending up to high energy .",
    "thus , the ( bosonic at long length scales ) inter - orbital collective plasmon is infra - red unstable in the non - lfl metal , and the continuum feature in @xmath171 strongly suggests charge - neutral _ fermion - like _ orbiton excitations instead : this is the closest we can get to an orbital liquid with fermion - like elementary excitations within dmft .",
    "in fact , our finding of a selective - mott metal is very similar to that of the fl@xmath3 fractionalised liquid found in the context of @xmath172-electron metals by senthil _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in our case ,",
    "the renormalised fermi surface ( fs ) of the metallic orbital liquid now has a sharply defined sheet corresponding to the @xmath121 fermion band , while the @xmath119 fs is `` critical '' .",
    "we thus dub our metal as an orbital fl@xmath3 ( ofl@xmath3 ) state , with asymptotically decoupled charge and orbiton excitations at low energy .",
    "this is very different from works where an orbital liquid state was proposed earlier on basis of slave - boson hartree - fock theories  @xcite , where computing higher - order effects ( beyond hf ) of strongly coupled fermion - boson fluctuations present a formidable problem ( in the absence of these , difficulties similar to those found in slave - particle approaches to the @xmath173 model are expected to arise ) .",
    "as in the fl@xmath3 case , we expect that the ofl@xmath3 state is stable at low but intermediate energy scales in @xmath37 , and instabilities to orbital - cum - magnetic ordered or lfl states will intervene at lower @xmath144 to relieve its extensive degeneracy ( finite entropy per site ) .",
    "thus , ordered state(s ) will arise directly from the non - lfl ( `` local '' critical ) metal , rather than from a band fs nesting - induced transition of a lfl , as would happen in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "onset of the osmt also drastically transforms the bare band structure . in the correlated lfl ( non - osmt )",
    "phase of the two - band model , adiabatic continuity with the free fermi gas implies that the traditional perturbative version of luttinger s theorem must hold .",
    "the renormalized fermi surfaces are then identical ( in shape and size ) to that of the unperturbed two - band model , since the self - energies have no momentum dependence in dmft .",
    "once the osmt occurs , however , appearance of the @xmath136 pole in im@xmath151 implies that im@xmath174 at @xmath175 .",
    "this causes a non - perturbative breakdown of adiabatic continuity , leading to wipe - out of lfl quasiparticles in the ofl@xmath3 phase  @xcite .",
    "the resulting `` fermi surface '' is now a critical one , corresponding to a modified luttinger count of @xmath121-fermions .",
    "an important consequence of this non - perturbative ( topological , driven by wipe - out of the @xmath119 fermi surface by penetration of zeros of @xmath176 in the osmt phase to @xmath136 ) fermi surface reconstruction is that instabilities to orbital- and/or magnetically ordered phases can no longer be rationalized by appealing to possible nesting features of the unperturbed fermi surface(s ) , since the one - to - one correspondence between the unperturbed and renormalized fermi surfaces has been wiped out by onset of the osmt . as increasingly appreciated  @xcite , it is thus impossible to write down a traditional ginzburg - landau field theory by integrating out the _ unperturbed _ fermions , since these do not exist as stable elementary excitations any more .",
    "in fact , it is even impossible to write down a luttinger - ward functional when im@xmath177 diverges , emphasizing that any instability to ordered states from such an anomalous metal must be truly unconventional .",
    "the above mott transition and ofl@xmath3 state leave their characteristic fingerprint on one- and two - particle physical responses .",
    "in addition to canomalous continuum features in angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , optical conductivity studies constitute a well - known spectroscopic diagnostic of two - particle response . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the optical conductivity across the tilt - driven mott transition above .",
    "consistent with the small gap ( @xmath178  ev ) mott insulator in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath143 , the optical conductivity , @xmath179 , shows an onset from @xmath180  ev , along with a mid - infrared feature and incoherent hubbard band features at higher energy .",
    "the multiple hubbard peaks arise from inter - orbital ( @xmath181 ) and intra - orbital ( @xmath82 ) processes across the hubbard bands in the mott insulator . with reduction of the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt , onset of (",
    "bad ) metallicity is reflected in @xmath179 as a large scale transfer of high - energy spectral weight to low energies , on the scale of more than @xmath182  ev , a characteristic fingerprint of mottness .",
    "additionally , no quasi - coherent drude ( lfl ) peak is resolved in the spectra : instead , a low - energy pseudogap feature ( with a mid - infrared hump ) is clearly seen for @xmath147 .",
    "this evolves into an anomalous continuum with a slow fall - off in energy ( and smeared mid - infrared feature ) for @xmath141 , signalling increasing tendency toward low - energy coherence as the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt is reduced .",
    "the marked absence of a quasi - coherent drude response at low energy is a clear manifestation of the wipe - out of the lattice ( lfl ) coherence scale in the selective - mott metal in dmft .",
    "thus , analysis of optical response of half - metallic and multi - orbital - based tmos could be used to unearth the multi - orbiton continuum at intermediate - but - low t. optical studies of tmo thin films the @xmath168 ratio in @xmath63 ) could confirm this trend in heterostructures : we predict that varying the a - cation in abo@xmath0 films will show the evolution of @xmath179 from mott insulating to bad - metallic as the a - cation size is increased , e.g , changing the rare - earth ( r ) ion in rnio@xmath0 or doped rmno@xmath0 films from r = ho to r = la across the lanthanide series .",
    "our work suggests that selective - mottness , bad - metallicity and novel fractionalised excitations , hitherto features of theories for certain @xmath172-electron metals and cuprates , might be found `` across the board '' as orbital - fl@xmath3 states in correlated tmos .",
    "in particular , it is known that arpes lineshapes and transport data for bilayer manganites show very `` strange '' features : arpes lineshapes are anomalously broad , as in near - optimally doped cuprates , especially at temperatures higher than the orbital and magnetic ordering scales , and momentum - space ( nodal - versus - anti - nodal ) differentiation persists even above @xmath183 .",
    "it would be tempting to try and link such `` strange '' features to our proposed ofl@xmath3 state .",
    "however , in spite of very close similarities to the fl@xmath3 idea in kondo - rkky models , more formal field - theoretic work is needed to tease out the fractionalised orbitons in multi - orbital systems showing osmt .",
    "this is beyond scope of the present work , and is left for future work .",
    "the above results can now be readily used to gain qualitative insights into the effects of epitaxial strain on conduction states ( metal - insulator , orbital - magnetic order ) in tmo films grown on suitable substrates , e.g , lanio@xmath0/laalo@xmath0 ( lno / lao ) superlattice grown on a tio@xmath6-terminated ( 001-face ) srtio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "we also qualitatively argue how competing ( novel ) ordered states may arise upon appropriate `` strain engineering '' in tmo thin films .",
    "we begin by adapting our dmft results and insights to a general model that is expected to hold for the system of an interface between a transition - metal oxide ( manganites or lanio@xmath0 , for example ) on another transition - metal oxide substrate with abo@xmath0 structure but with slightly different lattice parameters ( e.g , srtio@xmath0 ) . in such",
    "a simplified but very effective model  @xcite , the essentials can be recast in terms of energy balance at the interface between competing energies :    @xmath157 the film cell parameters are constrained to fit those of the substrate .",
    "since this implies bond elongation of film cell constants , it relaxes slowly .",
    "this constraint produces a unit - cell volume constraint : @xmath184 , that appears as an elastic term in the free energy , given by @xmath185 . for lsmo on sto , this contribution is @xmath186  ev  @xcite .",
    "@xmath165 due to epitaxial constraints ( compressive or tensile strain affecting the inplanar hoppings , and the gdfeo@xmath0 tilts at the interface ) , the electronic structure of the film undergoes drastic reconstruction , especially so in conditions realizing an osmt , as described above .",
    "let us consider the case where the hopping integral between the film and the substrate orbitals is affected by the renormalization of the electronic structre of the film .",
    "for example , for the lsmo / sto interface , this integral corresponds to the matrix element    @xmath187    where @xmath188 .",
    "owing to the short metal - oxygen distance ( @xmath189 ) , within lda , this turns out to be @xmath190  ev in a best qualitative estimate , while @xmath191  ev . plugging these into @xmath192 yields @xmath193  ev .",
    "near an osmt , however , there is a further drastic many - body renormalization due to the very small @xmath194 .",
    "if we take typical values for @xmath195 , the renormalized @xmath192 in a strongly correlated situation is now scaled down to @xmath196  ev ( this is in contrast to the earlier estimate  @xcite , which gave a much larger @xmath197  ev ) .",
    "these estimates now allow us to use this simple qualitative model to estimate the fate of the structural changes at the interface .",
    "this is because one realizes the interfacial structure with @xmath198 if the elastic energy wins over the electronic delocalization energy , while another structure with @xmath199 obtains when the electronic delocalization energy exceeds the elastic energy .",
    "it is clear from ( i),(ii ) above that this is a rather delicate balancing act in interfaces made from strongly correlated systems . in particular ,",
    "small changes in epitaxial constraints via strain tuning mentioned in the introduction can now easily tilt the balance between these two energies , leading to rather pronounced structural - cum - electronic changes at the interface .",
    "we detail upon this aspect below .",
    "\\(i ) tensile strain ( @xmath200 ) reduces the hopping via @xmath201 . with increasing tensile strain ,",
    "the correlated metal can thus be driven continuously to a mott insulator .",
    "further , since t - strain stabilizes the @xmath106 relative to the @xmath108 orbital , it increases the tendency toward an effective one - band model in the less - than - or - equal to the quarter - filled case , with ferro - orbital order and antiferromagnetic spin order , as in the cuprates .",
    "this is borne out by an explicit calculation on a related but different model for manganites  @xcite , which shows that @xmath200 increases the extent of the @xmath12-phase , reducing those of the fm and ce phases .    for not - too - large separation between the @xmath106 and @xmath108 orbitals",
    ", the @xmath1-wave interband hybridisation gives rise to a novel possibility : it is conducive for observation of the exotic circulating current phase proposed by varma for cuprates  @xcite , but with the circulating current patterns on three - site triangles connecting two in - plane @xmath8 sites to the apical one  @xcite if @xmath145 is small .",
    "an important difference from the cuprates is that the @xmath108 orbital is now empty , rather than filled ; nevertheless , for not - too - large @xmath202 , the @xmath1-wave hybridisation in the two - band hubbard model can populate the @xmath108 orbital and still give cc phases  @xcite .",
    "while this fascinating proposal is presently intensively debated in the cuprate context , we propose that appropriate strain engineering might reveal its existence in @xmath2-orbital based tmo heterostructures .",
    "this mapping to an effective one - orbital model _ with _",
    "an additional @xmath1-wave inter - orbital hybridisation in the tight - binding fit in the @xmath47 basis has further novel consequences . in particular , multi - orbital",
    ", unconventional @xmath1-wave nematic order can also readily arise as a particle - hole condensate via a finite @xmath203cos@xmath204cos@xmath205 .",
    "this will occur in a way similar to that found for the bilayer ruthenate sr@xmath0ru@xmath6o@xmath206  @xcite and for underdoped fe - arsenides  @xcite .",
    "additionally , a @xmath1-wave superconductor can also result as a particle - particle condensate with a finite @xmath207 , where @xmath208cos@xmath204cos@xmath209 .",
    "both these ordered states must result from the same microscopic interaction , and thus must be competing orders . in the non - lfl metal with infra - red singularities found in dmft , these ordered states will result from a generalised hartree - fock ( ghf ) decoupling of the most relevant _ residual _ intersite two - particle interactions ( since the one - electron mixing term ( @xmath210 ) in @xmath126 is irrelevant in the critical metal in the absence of well - defined lfl quasiparticles ) .",
    "this residual two particle interaction is analogous to spin - orbital superexchange in mott insulating phases , and is ipso - facto justified in the osmt phase we find  @xcite : @xmath211 .",
    "since this interaction scales like @xmath212 ( with @xmath213 the spatial dimensionality ) , a ghf decoupling indeed turns out to be _ exact _ within our dmft .",
    "\\(ii ) compressive strain ( @xmath214 ) has exactly the reverse effect - it increases @xmath91 and stabilizes the @xmath108 relative to the @xmath106 orbital .",
    "thus , a mott - insulator to correlated ( non - lfl ) metal transition can be driven by increasing compressive strain .",
    "the situation for the ordered states is now more subtle , however .",
    "the stabilisation and preferential occupation of the @xmath108 orbitals implies favoring af order in the bulk .",
    "this goes hand - in - hand with a reversal of the _ net _ `` splitting '' , @xmath215 from positive for @xmath200 to negative for @xmath214 .",
    "thus , viewed from the starting point of an unstrained system ( @xmath216 ) with @xmath217 , c - strain produces , remarkably enough , an effective situation that corresponds to a system with a _ negative _ inter - orbital charge - transfer ( ct ) energy .",
    "this identification allows us to interpret the mott transition in this case as one driven by `` self - doping '' a negative - ct insulator .",
    "further , this situation also implies that the @xmath1-wave ( nematic , sc ) states discussed for t - strain now become unfavorable .",
    "these are concrete examples of how strain engineering can sensitively affect the delicate balance between competing orders , and produce surprising features not to be found in the bulk",
    ". an exotic scenario would be where the balance between electronic delocalization energy and elastic energy can be tuned by strain engineering .",
    "this would make it conceivable , for example , to realize an unexpected outcome wherein a tmo thin film with @xmath199 can be `` tuned '' into a state with @xmath198 or vice - versa . in a multi - orbital system , this will drastically reconstruct the interfacial electronic structure , leading to emergence of ordered states not expected in the bulk .",
    "this is because @xmath199 and @xmath198 correspond to `` tensile '' and `` compressive '' strain which , as discussed above , lead to drastically different and novel outcomes for ordering instabilities at the interface via reconstruction of correlated electronic states .",
    "other observations may also be qualitatively rationalizable within our model study .",
    "for example , the experimental finding of a reduced conductivity and magnetic ordering scales in manganite thin films relative to their bulk values  @xcite is also naturally understood from our results .",
    "this arises from three factors , all of which conspire to produce an effective reduction in @xmath218 :    \\(i ) reduction in lattice co - ordination number in the film relative to the bulk reduces screening of the hubbard @xmath219 , which increase as a result .",
    "\\(ii ) lattice mismatch at the interface reduces the @xmath218 via tolerance factor and strain effects  @xcite effects , which acts like enhanced tilt relative to the bulk gdfeo@xmath0 tilt .",
    "\\(iii ) larger @xmath220 ratio implies selfconsistent enhancement of the net jt coupling via increased tendency toward localisation .",
    "the consequent ( self - consistent ) reduction of @xmath218 qualitatively explains lowered conductivity ( increased localisation ) as well as reduction in magnetic ordering scales , since @xmath221 and for fm , @xmath222 in the de limit .",
    "thus , as qualitatively alluded to in earlier sections , the structural de and its interplay with conventional ah - de is predicted to sensitively affect transport and magnetic ordering scales in tmo films in ways not always anticipated in the bulk case .",
    "finally , extension of our dmft to multilayers requires considration of the @xmath100-axis hopping ( @xmath223 ) , neglected in our @xmath37 modelling .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have considered this aspect in detail in a related model for manganites .",
    "how these effects will affect physical properties in response to external stimuli and affect the interplay of competing ordered states within remains an open issue of great interest in the tmo heterostructure context .",
    "in conclusion , we have considered the detailed effect of the gdfeo@xmath0 tilt , ubiquitous in tmo systems . using the two - orbital hubbard model as a template",
    ", we have identified a new feature , namely , that this tilt acts like a _ structural _ `` reverse double exchange '' in the orbital sector .",
    "it thus acts contrary to the anderson - hasegawa ( magnetic ) double exchange , and the competition between these two de processes is shown to be a generically relevant feature in tmos .",
    "this additional control parameter is attractive in the sense of not causing ( doping induced ) disorder , and can be continuously tuned by suitable choice of substrate and strain engineering . adopting a strong correlation view of tmo",
    ", this parameter sensitively affects carrier itinerance , inducing phase transitions between mott insulators and incoherent metals with ill - defined lfl quasiparticles .",
    "this breakdown of the lfl metal arises from the orbital - selective character of the mott transition , and we argue that this is an orbital - fl@xmath3 state with fractionalised orbitons . as a particularly attractive fall - out of our work , suitable strain engineering is also predicted to generate situations conducive to novel ordered states , whose further exploration is undoubtedly of great topical interest . a detailed study of this last aspect is left for future consideration ."
