    "astrophysical jets are systematically associated with the presence of an underlying accretion disk , both observationally and theoretically ( see knigl & pudritz 2000 for a recent review ) . in the case of protostellar objects ,",
    "accretion disks are resolved by means of infrared and millimeter surveys and interferometric mappings down to scales of a few tens of au . in the optical and the near infrared , hst",
    "high resolution images of disks in several jet sources have also been obtained ( padgett et al . 1999 ) . with an apparent relation found between accretion and ejection in the form of a strong correlation between outflow signatures and accretion diagnostics ( see e.g. cabrit et al . 1990 , cabrit & andr 1991 , hartigan et al . 1995 ) , stellar jets seem to be powered by the gravitational energy released in the accretion process .",
    "these facts and considerations have led several authors to develop models of disk winds .",
    "the pioneering work of bardeen & berger ( 1978 ) on a hydrodynamic radially self - similar model of a hot galactic wind was generalized in the seminal paper of blandford & payne ( 1982 , henceforth bp82 ) by including a rotating magnetic field .",
    "in particular , in bp82 it was shown that a cold plasma can be launched magneto - centrifugally from a keplerian disk , similarly to a bead on a wire , provided that the magnetic field lines are sufficiently inclined from the axis . since then , steady and axisymmetric mhd models , self - similar in the radial direction , have been successfully analyzed and generalized in the literature ( see e.g. contopoulos & lovelace 1994 , henceforth cl94 , li 1995 , 1996 , ferreira 1997 , ostriker 1997 , vlahakis & tsinganos 1998 , henceforth vt98 , lery et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a major problem is however still open on the validity of the various classes of radially self - similar solutions analyzed so far .",
    "because , as it is well known since the original work of weber & davis ( 1967 ) on the rotating magnetized solar wind in the equatorial region , acceptable outflowing solutions must cross smoothly all singularities related to the characteristic speeds of the mhd perturbations , i.e. , the poloidal alfvn velocity and the slow / fast magnetosonic velocities .",
    "however , in radially self - similar equations the critical points are not found where the poloidal speed of the flow is equal to the characteristic velocities of these magnetosonic waves . in the cold model of bp82 the `` modified '' fast magnetosonic critical point ( where @xmath0 in the bp82 notation ) is found downstream of the position where the poloidal velocity of the wind is equal to the fast magnetosonic velocity .",
    "subsequently it has been shown that this is a general property of the axisymmetric steady mhd equations : the singularities of the equations coincide with the positions of the limiting characteristics , or separatrices , within the hyperbolic domain of the governing equations ( bogovalov 1994 , tsinganos et al .",
    "in particular , bogovalov ( 1994 , 1996 ) pointed out the key role played by the singularity occurring at the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface ( fmss ) .",
    "namely , the asymptotic region of the jet is causally disconnected from the base of the flow , only for solutions that cross the critical point at the fmss .",
    "this means that every terminal perturbation or shock does not affect the outflow structure upstream of the position of this critical point . and , tsinganos et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have given several analytical examples where the true singularities of the equations do not coincide with the positions where the governing partial differential mhd equations change character from elliptic to hyperbolic and vice versa .",
    "for the sake of simplicity from now on we shall indicate by ` fast / slow magnetosonic singularity ' , or in short modified fast / slow , the critical points at the fmss / smss .",
    "it turns out that in none of the previous models of disk - winds a solution has been found to cross the fmss .",
    "for example , li ( 1995 , 1996 ) and ferreira ( 1997 ) , starting from the accretion disk , succeeded to cross the slow magnetosonic and the alfvn ones , but downwind turning points were found where the solutions terminate .",
    "such solutions can be connected to infinity only through a shock , as suggested by gomez de castro & pudritz ( 1993 ) .",
    "however in this case , as the wind velocity is subfast magnetosonic , a temporal evolution of the outflow is expected ( ouyed & pudritz 1997 ) .",
    "cylindrically collimated solutions were found by ostriker ( 1997 ) for a cold plasma , integrating the mhd system upstream from infinity and crossing the alfvn singularity , but always in the subfast magnetosonic regime . on the other hand , it has been shown that in collimated winds oscillations of streamlines are a common feature ( vlahakis & tsinganos 1997 ) .",
    "it thus seems that cylindrically collimated solutions without oscillations correspond to a rather particular choice of parameters that completely suppresses such oscillations .",
    "a slight change in these parameters induces the onset of oscillations which increase in amplitude until the configuration is destroyed ( vlahakis 1998 ) . since the ostriker ( 1997 )",
    "solutions are asymptotically subfast magnetosonic they are likely to be sensitive to perturbations from the external medium , unlike solutions that really satisfy all the criticality conditions",
    ". therefore , such solutions are likely to be structurally and topologically unstable ( vlahakis 1998 ) .",
    "however , it has been shown by contopoulos ( 1995 ) that , in the restricted case of a purely toroidal magnetic field , a smooth crossing of the fmss is possible .",
    "on the other hand in such a case an asymptotically cylindrically collimated configuration is not found ; in fact , a new transition to subfast magnetosonic velocities must occur anyway for radially self - similar winds .",
    "the only way out is then to match the superfast magnetosonic solution with a shock which is in this case in the physically disconnected domain .    in the present study",
    "we extend the analysis of bp82 , cl94 and contopoulos ( 1995 ) showing that an exact and simultaneous smooth crossing of three mhd critical surfaces is possible . in sec .",
    "2 we define the equations of the hot wind in the framework of a radially self - similar approach and outline the numerical technique . in sec .",
    "3 we explore the solution topologies in the region around and particularly downstream of the fmss , where the solution terminates , while in sec .",
    "4 are shown the features of a few solutions crossing all three critical points with conditions similar to those of bp82 . finally , in sec .",
    "5 we discuss the possible astrophysical applications of these solutions to stellar jets , and summarize the main implications of our results in comparison with previous ones obtained by other authors .",
    "in order to establish notation , in this section we give a brief derivation of radially self - similar disk - wind models with polytropic thermodynamics .",
    "the derivation is along the lines of a systematic method which unifies all self - similar mhd outflows and includes the bp82 model as the simplest case ( vt98 ) .      in steady @xmath1 and axisymmetric @xmath2 mhd ,",
    "the poloidal components of the hydromagnetic field ( @xmath3 ) are defined in terms of the magnetic flux function @xmath4 and mass to magnetic flux function @xmath5 in cylindrical ( @xmath6 ) or spherical ( @xmath7 ) coordinates , as : @xmath8 the azimuthal components are defined in terms of the total specific angular momentum @xmath9 and of the corotation frequency @xmath10 , which are functions of @xmath4 ( tsinganos 1982 ) : @xmath11 and of the poloidal alfvn number @xmath12 : @xmath13 transalfvnic flows require that , when @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are finite , i.e. : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the alfvn cylindrical radius ( the alfvn lever arm ) along the reference field line @xmath19 , with the dimensionless variable @xmath20 defined as some function of the magnetic flux function @xmath4 which can be reversed to give : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant with the dimensions of a magnetic field .",
    "as shown in vt98 , all existing classes of _ radially self - similar _ mhd solutions can be constructed by making the following two key assumptions : + ( i ) the alfvn number @xmath12 is solely a function of @xmath23 , such that the alfvn surface is conical : @xmath24 ( ii ) the cylindrical distance @xmath25 to the polar axis of some fieldline labeled by @xmath20 , normalized to its cylindrical distance @xmath26 at the alfvn point is also solely a function of @xmath23 : @xmath27    following these two assumptions the set of mhd equations is reduced to a system of three ordinary differential equations in @xmath23 for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the @xmath23 -dependence of the gas pressure ( see vt98 for details ) .",
    "depending on the assumptions on the free integrals @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , a few classes of radially self - similar solutions exist ( see vt98 ) . for only two of these classes",
    "a polytropic relationship between the gas pressure and the density is admitted : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the specific entropy ( the first two cases listed in table 3 of vt98 ) .",
    "in such a case @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the system of the mhd equations reduces to two first order differential equations for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , supplemented by the bernoulli integral which also provides the variable @xmath40 , the angle between a particular poloidal fieldline and the cylindrical direction @xmath41 at the spherical angle @xmath23 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath42 ( with the same notation as in cl94 , while in vt98 @xmath42 was denoted by @xmath43 ) governs the scaling of the magnetic field , while the rotation law is assumed keplerian .",
    "this particular class corresponds to the radially self - similar solutions analyzed in cl94 which contains as a special case the classical bp82 solution with @xmath44 .",
    "the full expressions of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) are given in the appendix , eqs .",
    "( a1 ) - ( a3 ) the expressions for the physical variables become then : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52      at the alfvn radius @xmath18 along the reference field line @xmath19 , we denote by @xmath53 and @xmath54 the pressure and density , respectively . the magnitude of the poloidal magnetic field at this alfvn point is @xmath55 while the corresponding poloidal alfvn speed is @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "the expressions of the free integrals defined in sec .",
    "2.1 can now be written as : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the sum of the kinetic , enthalpy , gravitational and poynting energy flux densities per unit of mass flux density , @xmath62 while @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the gravitational constant and the mass of the central body , respectively .    the solution of the system of eqs .",
    "( a1 ) - ( a3 ) depends on the six parameters @xmath42 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ apsi(a ) ] ) - ( [ op(a ) ] ) ( but see the discussion in sect .",
    "2.4.3 for the free parameters of the model ) .",
    "note that we have used for the parameters a similar but not an identical notation with bp82 , since it occurred to us that it is better to choose a different normalization .",
    "however , in the following we shall outline for convenience the correspondence between our parameters and those in bp82 .",
    "let us first discuss the physical meaning of the above parameters .",
    "first , the exponent @xmath42 is equal to @xmath70 in bp82 , while in ferreira ( 1997 ) it is related to the ejection index @xmath71 .",
    "this index @xmath72 is related to the accretion rate and to the mass flux in the wind if also the structure of the disk is assumed radially self - similar ( see e.g. ferreira 1997 ) .",
    "second , we remind that @xmath65 is the usual polytropic index .",
    "next , the constant @xmath66 is the keplerian speed at radius @xmath73 on the disk , in units of @xmath74 , i.e. , it is proportional to the ratio of the keplerian speed to the poloidal flow speed at the alfvn radial distance , @xmath75 , and is related to the corresponding constant @xmath76 in bp82 . since @xmath66 is also proportional to the mass to magnetic flux ratio , it is often called the mass loss parameter ( li 1995 , ferreira 1997 ) , @xmath77 the constant @xmath67 is the specific angular momentum of the flow in units of @xmath78 and is related to the corresponding constant @xmath79 in bp82 , @xmath80 the bernoulli constant @xmath68 is the sum of the enthalpy , kinetic , gravitational and poynting energy flux densities per unit of mass flux density divided by @xmath81 ( along @xmath82 ) and is related to the corresponding constant @xmath83 in bp82 , @xmath84 finally , the constant @xmath69 is proportional to the gas entropy , @xmath85     \\,.\\ ] ] in the above expressions , the label @xmath86 indicates the respective values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 at the base of the outflow .",
    "the correspondence between the parameter @xmath89 in bp82 and our @xmath90 is @xmath91    note that in bp82 @xmath65 does not appear since the outflow is cold and @xmath69 , although it is defined , is never used .",
    "also , a similar scaling exists for the parameters used in li ( 1995 ) and ferreira ( 1997 ) , although with slightly different notations and a further relation between @xmath42 and @xmath66 ( cf . eq . 28 in ferreira 1997 ) due to the connection with a self - similar accretion disk thread by a large scale magnetic field .      the numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( a1)-(a3 ) requires the fulfillment of the regularity conditions at the positions of the three singularities ( alfvn and slow / fast modified magnetosonic critical points ) .",
    "this implies that the six parameters of the solution are not all independent . in the following we",
    "first shortly summarize the main properties of the critical conditions before we discuss the numerical procedure to obtain the solutions .",
    "it is evident that eqs .",
    "( a2 ) and ( a3 ) become indeterminate at the alfvn surface where @xmath92 .",
    "the regularity condition at this critical point can be easily found together with the value of the derivative of @xmath93 ( see appendix ) .",
    "furthermore , the denominator of eq .",
    "( a2 ) vanishes when the meridional component of the velocity @xmath94 satisfies the quartic ( vlahakis 1998 ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the sound speed , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 the total and meridional components of the alfvn velocity , respectively .",
    "these singularities are typical ` x - type ' critical points , and the above equation is the well known dispersion relation for the magnetosonic waves .",
    "however it is crucial to see that these singularities appear not when the flow speed , but instead where its meridional component coincides with the meridional component of the slow / fast magnetosonic velocity .",
    "bogovalov ( 1994 , 1996 ) and tsinganos et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have emphasized that the singularities in mhd steady flows do not always coincide with the positions where the flow and the magnetosonic velocities coincide , but with the limiting characteristics , i.e. , the fmss and the smss . in our case the separatrix is found where @xmath94 is equal to either one of the triplet of the characteristic speeds ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is so because in addition to the azimuthal direction @xmath100 due to the assumed axisymmetry , we have a second symmetry direction , which is the radial direction @xmath101 because of the assumed radial self - similarity .",
    "therefore a compressible slow / fast mhd wave that preserves those two symmetries can only propagate along @xmath102 which is perpendicular to both @xmath100 and @xmath101 ; the speed of propagation of such a wave satisfies exactly the quartic eq .",
    "( [ quartic ] ) ( for details see tsinganos et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "it is obvious that a physically acceptable solution with low velocity and high density at the base , but high speed and low density asymptotically must smoothly cross at least the smss and the alfvn singularity .",
    "such solutions have been widely analyzed in previous papers and are consistent with the observational data on collimated stellar jets .",
    "however it is unescapable that also the fast magnetosonic singularity should be regularly crossed in order to have a steady structure causally disconnected from the asymptotic region , where the jet interacts with the environment ( bogovalov 1994 ) .",
    "an inherent difficulty of the problem is due to the fact that the positions of the previous critical points are not known a - priori , but need to be calculated simultaneously and selfconsistently with the sought for solution . at these critical points",
    "we do know some relations between various functions , for example , at the alfvn surface the regularity condition , eq .",
    "( a4 ) , should be satisfied .",
    "however , this knowledge alone is not practically enabling us to directly find a solution .",
    "the way we will follow to construct a solution through all critical points is to use the shooting method with successive iterations . by starting the integration from an angle @xmath103",
    "we reach a singular point where , e.g. , the denominator in @xmath104 vanishes , but not the numerator .",
    "we then go back and change some parameter and integrate again until it converges , i.e. , the denominator the numerator vanish simultaneously .",
    "a similar procedure is followed to cross the other singularity .",
    "a rather key point is the choice of the starting position of integration .",
    "most of the previous studies solved the equations by starting from the equator ( bp82 , cl94 ) , or from infinity ( ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "it occurred to us that it is more convenient to integrate the equations starting from the alfvn critical point , i.e. from the conical surface @xmath105 , and move upstream ( towards the base ) and downstream ( towards the external asymptotic region ) .",
    "for the numerical integration , besides the parameters , we need also to choose the value of the colatitude @xmath106 and the value there of the slope of the square of the alfvn number ( @xmath107 ) together with the angle of expansion of the poloidal streamlines ( @xmath108 ) . some of these quantities must be tuned to fulfill the singularity conditions at the three critical points .",
    "it turned out convenient for the assumed numerical technique to tune the values of @xmath67 and @xmath109 for getting the critical solution .",
    "hence , we first prescribe the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath42 , @xmath67 and @xmath66 , as well as @xmath109 , @xmath106 and @xmath110 while @xmath68 is deduced from the bernoulli equation , eq .",
    "( a3 ) , and @xmath69 from the regularity condition at the alfvn point , eq .",
    "the integration can now start upstream from @xmath105 and the smss is encountered , but we can not pass through it as , e.g. , the denominator of @xmath111 vanishes there , but not the numerator .",
    "we integrate again with different values of @xmath109 until we find the opposite behaviour around the slow magnetosonic singularity ( the numerator vanishes but not the denominator ) .",
    "iteratively , by fine tuning the value of @xmath109 , a solution is finally found which pass through the smss .    then we integrate downstream of the alfvn surface and the fmss is encountered , but in general it is not crossed .",
    "changing the value of the parameter @xmath67 we integrate upstream again tuning to a new value of @xmath109 until the smss is crossed .",
    "then we integrate downstream towards the fast magnetosonic singularity , and repeat all the procedure until we find the right values of @xmath109 and @xmath112 that allow the crossing of the two singularities . at this point",
    "the complete solution is obtained by integrating , with the correct values for all the parameters , upstream to the base and downstream towards the asymptotic region .      in this study ,",
    "the critical solution depends on the two ` model ' parameters ( @xmath65 , @xmath42 ) and the three independent ` fieldline ' parameters ( @xmath66 , @xmath106 , @xmath110 ) .",
    "the remaining ones ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath109 , @xmath67 ) are deduced from the bernoulli equation and the crossing of the alfvn , slow magnetosonic and fast magnetosonic singularities , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of bogovalov ( 1997 ) where it is argued that since the number of equations must be equal to the number of independent boundary conditions , a unique solution can be found if this number of independent boundary conditions equals to the number of outgoing waves generated at the reflection of a plane wave from that boundary . in @xmath113-dependent polytropic mhd there are 7 equations and 7 unknowns : the density , the pressure , the 3 components of the velocity and the 2 components of the magnetic field .",
    "there are also 7 waves : the entropy wave and the outwards / inwards propagating slow , alfvn and fast mhd waves .",
    "so , we need 7 parameters with both counts , as expected . now ,",
    "if the boundary of the outflow is in the subslow region the number of _ outgoing _ waves from this boundary is 4 , i.e. , the entropy , slow , alfvn and fast mhd outgoing waves . subtracting the number of the boundary conditions we are left with 3 independent parameters , precisely @xmath66 , @xmath106 and @xmath110 .",
    "note that the polytropic index @xmath65 and @xmath42 should not be included in this count since they are model parameters and do not depend on a particular streamline .",
    "the integration is terminated in the upstream region when @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in all the calculations presented here we were able to follow the solution up to the equator , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "this base should be in principle the disk surface , where our solutions should consistently fit particular boundary conditions .",
    "such an approach has been followed by ferreira ( 1997 ) who looked for inflow / outflow mhd solutions with a consistent matching on the disk surface ( see also li 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "this implies some further constraints on the parameters .",
    "for instance , _ if _ the disk is also self - similar with a large scale magnetic field , a relation between @xmath66 and @xmath42 is expected , i.e. , the mass loading in the outflow and the magnetic flux distribution on the disk .",
    "in addition , if the outflow carries away all the angular momentum from the disk @xmath42 must be related to @xmath67 .",
    "as described above , the procedure to obtain a critical solution is extremely lengthy and rather time consuming .",
    "we must in fact approach as close as possible the singularities ( @xmath119 ) , and this requires the determination of the parameters up to several digits . as we are mainly concerned to analyze the general behaviour of superfast magnetosonic solutions , in the present study we do not investigate the details of the boundaries of the outflow . therefore we assume that between the base of the wind and the disk surface there is a thin ` transition ' region that allows the connection of the wind with the disk .    for similar reasons",
    "the present analysis has been performed only for a limited set of values of the parameters .",
    "we have fixed the ` fieldline ' parameters @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , while two values have been assumed for the ` model ' parameter @xmath42 : 0.75 ( model i ) and 0.7525 ( model ii ) . in this two cases",
    "we will assume that the polytropic index @xmath123 , i.e. some amount of heating occurs in the plasma . to make a comparison with a purely magnetocentrifugally driven outflow , we shortly discuss also the very general properties of an adiabatic solution ( @xmath124 ) assuming @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath44 ( i.e. , values of @xmath106 and @xmath110 very close to those used for the nonadiabatic models i and ii on purpose have been selected ) .    in the following two sections we outline the main properties of the topologies around the fmss and discuss the structure of the critical solutions .",
    "we present here the topology of two solutions around the fast magnetosonic point , assuming @xmath128 and @xmath129 for fixed @xmath44 .",
    "the two slightly different values of the polytropic index define the transition between two families of topologies .",
    "this drastic change in the topological behavior of the solutions in the neighborhood of the x - type point illustrates the difficulty of exact crossing the fast magnetosonic point .",
    "the parameters for the various cases are listed in tab . 1 , while in fig .",
    "1 we plot the two sets of topologies for the superfast magnetosonic number @xmath130 . note that this plot is obtained from a projection of the solutions from the 3-d space of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath23 to the plane @xmath131  @xmath23 .",
    "this three - dimensional structure of the topology explains why some of the lines obtained by projection are crossing each other ( see for another such example tsinganos & sauty 1992 ) .",
    "this feature of course does not appear in more classical topologies of one - dimensional solutions , e.g. , weber & davis ( 1967 ) .    in the first case ( @xmath128 ) three solutions are plotted in fig .",

    "then , this solution continues marching towards increasing @xmath23 and remains always subfast magnetosonic , with @xmath131 reaching a maximum at @xmath136 .",
    "by slightly decreasing @xmath67 the solution crosses the @xmath135 line with infinite slope at @xmath137 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "conversely , for a slightly larger value of @xmath67 the solution ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "1a ) reaches a maximum at @xmath138 remaining subfast magnetosonic ( i.e. it behaves like a ` breeze ' solution ) and becomes superfast magnetosonic with diverging slope at @xmath139 .",
    "then , this solution remains always in the region @xmath140 , with a spiraling behaviour , i.e. , by crossing many times up and down the @xmath135 transition with infinite slope .",
    "note that the solution shown in fig .",
    "10 of ferreira ( 1997 ) probably belongs to this family of non critical solutions .    for @xmath141 ( fig .",
    "1b ) the topology of the non critical solutions remains the same .",
    "the critical solution however shows a different behaviour remaining always in the region @xmath140 by spiraling around the @xmath142 transition ( solid line in fig .",
    "the topological structure of our solutions implies that downstream of the fmss a focal critical point must be present , so that no solution can asymptotically reach @xmath143 with superfast magnetosonic speeds .",
    "this ought to be expected from the construction of this model where we should have @xmath144 , if we have a cylindrically collimated outflow .",
    "in other words , the surface @xmath142 needs to be crossed again with a downstream superfast / subfast magnetosonic transition ( see also contopoulos 1995 ) . at the same time",

    "3 , where the poloidal streamlines together with the characteristics are plotted .",
    "they cross all critical surfaces , and for @xmath140 the fieldlines converge towards the symmetry axis such that the conical region with @xmath140 is causally disconnected from the rest of the domain .",
    "the two families of the characteristics in the hyperbolic domain bounded by the cusp and slow surfaces are better seen in fig .",
    "4 obtained for the adiabatic case , with a different set of parameters .",
    "one family of characteristics ( black ) is tangent to the smss at @xmath162 while the other ( grey ) crosses it .",
    "similarly , in the hyperbolic domain bounded by the cone where @xmath159 one of the family of the characteristics ( black ) is tangent to the fmss indicated by @xmath142 while the other ( grey ) crosses it .",
    "we remind that the cusp surface ( @xmath163 ) does not coincide with any singularity or typical velocity in the flow .",
    "the components of the outflow speed along a line @xmath164 in units of the initial @xmath152-component of the flow speed at the disk , are plotted in fig .",
    "the units are choosen in order to make a direct comparison of this solution with other solutions in the literature ( e.g. bp82 ) .",
    "close to the disk level , the escape speed is high , @xmath165 , the initial rotational speed is lower , @xmath166 and of the order of the keplerian speed , @xmath167 .",
    "the azimuthal speed @xmath15 after some increase in the region of corotation , approximately up to the alfvn critical point at @xmath168 , decays to zero transferring its corresponding kinetic energy to poloidal motion .",
    "thus , the @xmath152- and @xmath25-components of the poloidal motion grow from their subslow and subescape values at the disk level where @xmath169 to the high values obtained at the modified fast critical point where @xmath170 .",
    "the poloidal speed exceeds the local escape speed around the alfvn transition . a comparison of model i and ii makes clear that the different values of @xmath42 do not strongly affect the global behaviour of the solutions , even though the boundary conditions of the disk are rather different .",
    "1=    1    1=    1    downstream of the alfvn transition the azimuthal component of the magnetic field grows to very high values in comparison to the poloidal component ( fig .",
    "6 ) . at the modified fast critical point",
    "practically all the magnetic flux is in the azimuthal direction .",
    "for example , @xmath171 at the disk , while @xmath172 after the modified fast transition for both , models i and ii . from fig",
    ". 6 it may be also seen that the flow velocity is largely in the @xmath152-direction with very small components along @xmath100 and @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "6 , the main difference between the two models is in the region upstream of the smss : for @xmath44 the angle between the poloidal fieldline and the disk surface is @xmath173 , while for @xmath151 this angle is @xmath174 .",
    "although these values are not very different , only the second case matches the outflow launching condition for a cold plasma given in bp82 .",
    "this means that magnetocentrifugal driving is more efficient in model ii at the base .",
    "however , we note that at the ssms where the plasma pressure has dropped significantly both solutions can be magneto - centrifugally accelerated .",
    "the end result shown in fig .",
    "5 is that the terminal speed is lower when @xmath42 is larger , i.e. , when the ejection index is higher .",
    "this result is consistent with ferreira s ( 1997 ) analysis .",
    "the behaviour of the various components of the conserved total energy @xmath61 _ vs. _ @xmath152 , plotted in fig . 7 , provides information on the different driving mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the outflow .",
    "upstream of the smss and close to the base , most of the energy flux is electromagnetic plus some amount of enthalpy .",
    "the kinetic energy of the plasma is negligible .",
    "as the slow magnetosonic surface is approached , the kinetic energy sharply increases with a corresponding decrease of the thermal energy .",
    "downstream of the alfvn surface the poynting flux rapidly decreases ; the poloidal kinetic energy keeps increasing , becoming largely the main component of the energy flux at the position of the fmss .",
    "this behaviour is basically the same for both models i and ii . in order words , there is some contribution to the acceleration of thermal origin up to the modified slow critical point after which the pressure drops to a rather constant value while the magnetic pressure maintains considerably higher values up to the alfvn transition .",
    "we conclude this section by pointing out that the two solutions we have analyzed here correspond to efficient magnetic rotators in the terminology of bogovalov & tsinganos ( 1999 ) , since the ratio of the corotational velocity to the poloidal alfvn velocity at the alfvn critical surface ( the parameter @xmath20 in their notation ) has a value greater than unity ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "before discussing the main physical implications of our results , also in connection with those obtained by other authors , we show that the present solutions are suitable to describe the physical properties of astrophysical outflows .",
    "the modeling of a particular astrophysical outflow requires first the calculation of all physical quantities from the non dimensional parameters characterizing the particular model .",
    "we will address here this question of calculating some observable quantities of disk - winds associated with protostellar objects from the parameters of our model .",
    "we deduce first the ratios of some characteristic speeds at the disk level , keeping in mind that from the numerical results we have obtained @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "we will refer in the following mainly to the solutions with @xmath44 .",
    "_ first _ , the ratio of the poloidal alfvn and keplerian speeds at the disk level is : @xmath178 the poloidal magnetic field which is essential in the launching of the outflow is anchored in the disk and its energy density is less than the rotational kinetic energy density of the disk .",
    "thus , the field is rather weak to brake the rotation of the plasma at the disk and it is carried passively around by azimuthal rotation .    _ second _ , the ratio of the sound and initial speeds at the disk level is : @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "the initial ejection speed is negligible in comparison to the thermal speed at the disk , a situation similar to a thermally driven wind .    _",
    "next _ , the ratio of the sound and keplerian speeds at the disk level is : @xmath181 we notice that the keplerian speed is about 3 times higher than the thermal speed at the disk .",
    "thus , thermal effects can not inhibit the rotation of the disk .",
    "_ finally _ , the ratio of the keplerian and initial speeds at the disk level is : @xmath182 i.e. , the initial speed is negligible in comparison to the keplerian speed .    in our case",
    "the flow speed at the fast critical point is about @xmath183 the initial speed @xmath184 . in agreement with the observations we can reasonably assume the terminal speed of the outflow to be @xmath185 km s@xmath186 , such that its velocity at the base is @xmath187 0.4 km s@xmath186 .    in principle , radially self - similar models do not have an intrinsic scale length ; however from the previous estimate of the initial speed one allows to calculate the footpoint of the reference fieldline @xmath19 on the disk . in units of 10 solar radii",
    "this cylindrical distance @xmath188 is : @xmath189 hence , for a one solar mass star we get @xmath190 .",
    "it is also interesting to calculate the mass - loss rate @xmath191 in units of @xmath192 : @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 by assuming @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 g we have @xmath199 , with a temperature at the base of the flow of : @xmath200 @xmath201 we remind that @xmath202 is not the temperature of the disk as we have assumed a transition layer between the disk surface and the base of the flow ( see sec .",
    "2 ) . this region could be reasonably related to a corona heated by dissipative processes in the plasma ( e.g. magnetic reconnection , ohmic heating , etc . ; see e.g. knigl & pudritz 2000 ) .    as the flow corotates roughly up to the alfvn point ( fig .",
    "5 ) the specific angular momentum carried by the wind is @xmath203 while the angular momentum that has to be extracted locally at the foot point @xmath188 of the fieldline in order that the disk accretes at a rate @xmath204 is @xmath205 ( spruit 1996 ) .",
    "if the angular momentum carried by the wind is a fraction @xmath206 of @xmath207 while @xmath208 is the fraction carried away by viscous stresses , then the ratio of the mass fluxes in the wind and in the accretion flow is @xmath209 taking into account that @xmath210 for model i. it follows that the rate of the outflowing mass is at most of the order of 1@xmath211 of the rate of the accreted mass ; and this is achieved when the wind carries all the angular momentum of the accreted mass .",
    "when the outflow carries a smaller fraction of the angular momentum of the disk , the mass loss rate in the wind is an even smaller fraction of the mass loss rate in the wind . in other words ,",
    "the mass loss rate in the wind is a negligible fraction of the accreted mass , despite that the jet may carry most of the angular momentum of the accreted mass .",
    "similar results are obtained for the case @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , from the above arguments we may conclude that from our solutions we deduce for the physical parameters values in reasonable agreement with those observed in this class of objects .",
    "our solution terminates at @xmath212 , i.e. , at @xmath213 astronomical units ( au ) from the central star . at this position we could argue that there exists a shock matching the solution with the outermost region of the outflow ( gomez de castro & pudritz 1993 )",
    "it is well known that bright knots are observed on scales of thousands au along most protostellar jets .",
    "these configurations are shocks that are interpreted as originated either by fluid instabilities on the jet surface or by temporal variations in the velocity of the outflow ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 , ray 1996 , 1998 , micono et al .",
    "1998 , knigl & pudritz 2000 ) .",
    "it could be reasonable to associate the terminal shock of our solutions with the inner knots , found at distances down to @xmath214 au from the star .",
    "however we can not ignore that these knots are non steady configurations and move outwards with velocities @xmath215 km s@xmath186 ( ray 1996 ) .",
    "we could assume that the shock is well upstream of the optical knots : polarimetric radio data on the t tauri object are consistent with the presence of a shock at @xmath216 au from the star ( ray et al .",
    "alternatively the terminal shock could indeed be located approximately at the positions of the inner knots , but there the flow looses both self - similarity and steadiness .",
    "however as we are in the superfast magnetosonic regime , the upwind configuration is not affected .",
    "only a much more detailed parametric study will be able to test these two possibilities .",
    "the solutions of this model , in particular fig .",
    "7 , illustrate nicely the physical process of transferring electromagnetic poynting energy flux and enthalpy to directed kinetic energy flux of the flow in order to accelerate a disk wind and then form a jet along the symmetry axis of the system .",
    "thus , the analysis of the previous section is interesting in the sense that it reveals the driving mechanisms of the outflow .",
    "the poloidal kinetic energy is negligible at the disk level .",
    "it then increases rather sharply up to the region of the smss and alfvn surfaces .",
    "this increase is at the expense of both , the enthalpy and the electromagnetic poynting energy flux ( see , fig .",
    "the poloidal velocity is directed basically in the radial direction ( figs . 5 and 6 ) , i.e. , here part of the random thermal energy together with a part of the electromagnetic energy",
    "are mostly transformed to directed wind expansion .",
    "downstream of the alfvn surface it is mainly the poynting energy flux that is effectively transformed into kinetic energy directed along the rotational axis , till the fmss is encountered .",
    "after the fmss , the flow has already reached the maximum speed available from the total energy e , which is also approximately equal to the initial electromagnetic poynting energy flux .",
    "then , the acceleration asymptotically stops .",
    "despite the fact that most of the acceleration to high speeds is apparently of magnetic origin , the role of the polytropic index and thus of the initial thermal acceleration may not be negligible , in particular in the region before the smss .",
    "for example , in the case of fig . 4 where the flow is exactly adiabatic and @xmath124 , the critical solution achieves only a very small axial component of the velocity which is twice the axial velocity on the equatorial plane . in the quasi - isothermal case of models i and ii where @xmath147 , the maximum velocity is 1000 , higher than the equatorial one ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "as a matter of fact , this last case is closer to the one analyzed in li ( 1995 ) and ferreira ( 1997 ) where the gas is isothermal up to the first critical surface and then it is taken to be cold afterwards , wherein the pressure has sufficiently dropped . however , another possibility is that the low terminal speed obtained in the adiabatic case of fig .",
    "4 could be due to the lower value of the rotation parameter @xmath217 which is @xmath218 in the adiabatic case of fig .",
    "4 , as opposed to values @xmath219 and 136 in models i and ii and similarly for the case examined in ferreira ( 1997 ) .",
    "when the gas has reached a high speed along the @xmath152-axis , its inertia causes it to lag behind the rotation of the field line and the field is wound up , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , resulting to a highly twisted magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the strong curvature force of this predominantly azimuthal magnetic field towards the @xmath152-axis , causes the poloidal field to collimate .",
    "initially the field is flaring away from the rotation axis but the curvature force bends the poloidal field lines toward the rotation axis .",
    "the azimuthal velocity peaks around the alfvn point which is at a height @xmath220 and a cylindrical distance @xmath221 times the starting distance @xmath188 in model i. beyond the alfvn point the rotation drops in accordance to angular momentum conservation and thus the centrifugal force becomes negligible .",
    "then , the strong inwards curvature force of the twisted field , wins , over the weak outwards centrifugal force and gas pressure gradient with the result that the lines are bent and eventually collapse towards the rotation axis .",
    "it is interesting that this feature of the collapse of the outflow towards the rotation axis which appears in cold models ( bp82 ) and models that do not cross the fmss ( li 1995 , ferreira 1997 ) , is also preserved in the present hot model where also all critical points are crossed .",
    "this result seems to indicate the rather dominant role of the magnetic hoop stress in radially self - similar models , contrary to what happens in meridionally self - similar models wherein the structure becomes asymptotically cylindrical ( trussoni et al .",
    "1997 , sauty et al .",
    "1999 , vlahakis & tsinganos 1999 ) .",
    "it is worth to clarify for a moment the term `` disk - wind '' that we used in this study . by that term",
    "we simply intend to indicate that we describe an outflow from a disk - like structure accreting onto a central gravitational object .",
    "thus , the flow starts at some angle @xmath222 above or at the equatorial plane of the disk , as opposed to a `` stellar '' wind flow that starts radially above or at a spherical or quasi - spherical source .",
    "needless to say that a consistent solution of the accreting part of the flow would be required for a consistent solution of the inflow - outflow structure in the case of a disk - wind .",
    "however , such a complete undertaking is beyond the scope of the present paper which only intends to emphasize the possibility to construct complete steady self - similar solutions for the wind crossing all critical points .    to make such a connection between the disk and the outflow , in the spirit of bp82 , li ( 1995 ) and ferreira ( 1997 )",
    ", the first step would be to see how our parameters may fall into the range of parameters considered by those models .",
    "for that purpose , in eqs .",
    "( [ bpk ] ) - ( [ bpxii ] ) we have made a correspondance between our parameters and those used by bp82 . thus , in the  standard \" solution of bp82 the parameters are : @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 corresponding to a launching angle of the jet at the disk @xmath226 . in our case , we find @xmath227 , @xmath228 , for both , model i and model ii .",
    "we also have @xmath229 ( @xmath230 ) for model i and @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) for model ii , in the bp82 notation .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath233 are close in bp82 and the present model .",
    "however , the value of the launching angle @xmath90 is @xmath234 in our model i because of the additional thermal driving of the outflow at the disk level , contrary to the cold model of bp82 where @xmath235 . in summary ,",
    "our models i and ii occupy in the space of @xmath76 and @xmath79 , roughly the same domain as in bp82 ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 in bp82 ) .",
    "the only difference is in the value of the launching angle @xmath90 which can be larger in the present hot model , as expected .",
    "these values are within the range of the allowed parameters in the ( @xmath76 , @xmath79 ) space also in the analysis of li ( 1995 , cf .",
    "3 ) provided that the magnetic diffusivity is of order one . note also",
    "that model ii with @xmath151 corresponds to an ejection index in the notation of ferreira ( 1997 ) @xmath236 .      in this paper",
    "we have extended the classical work of blandford and payne ( 1982 ) , mainly by showing via examples for the first time that a solution passing through all mhd critical points can indeed be constructed .",
    "as is well known , the fmss plays the role of the mhd signal horizon such that in an outflow crossing this mhd horizon all perturbations which the outflow may encounter are convected downstream by the superfast outflow and so the steady state solution is maintained . in other words ,",
    "the outflow interior to the fmss is causally disconnected and protected against any conditions it may encounter in the interstellar or intergalactic medium towards which the jet propagates after it is launched by magnetocentrifugal forces from the surface of an accretion disk .    unlike other analytical models which produce asymptotically cylindrically collimated outflows ( sauty & tsinganos 1994 , trussoni et al .",
    "1997 , vt98 , sauty et al . 1999 ,",
    "vlahakis & tsinganos 1999 ) , this class of radially self - similar models can not continue to infinity but it has to be stopped downstream of the fmss and matched via a mhd shock to a subfast outflow that mixes with the interstellar medium ( gomez de castro & pudritz 1993 ) .",
    "this shock can connect the present solutions to some breeze , subalfvn or subslow magnetosonic branch perhaps also preserving the self - similarity .",
    "thus , the main difference here with previous results presented in the literature is that the asymptotic part of the present solutions is causally disconnected from the source and hence any perturbation downstream of the superfast transition can not affect the whole structure of the steady outflow .",
    "this task of matching the present solutions with a downstream shock however remains a challenge for future studies , together with a ( time - consuming ) more extended parametric analysis and also a correct matching of the ideal mhd outflow solutions with an inflow in a non - ideal accretion disk ( ferreira 1997 ) .",
