    "the quark propagator is a building block of quantum chromodynamics and has been studied in numerous formulations  @xcite .",
    "the lattice regularisation provides a method for a full nonperturbative calculation from first principles . in the infrared , the quark propagator displays dynamical mass generation , but in the ultraviolet it takes its perturbative , running form .    by computing the quark propagator on the lattice we can connect with perturbation theory and with many models .",
    "we can also contribute to our understanding of the inner workings of the lattice simulations themselves .",
    "it has been seen , however , that detailed lattice studies of the quark propagator require sophisticated actions  @xcite .",
    "we present some results for the quark propagator in landau gauge from a variety of lattice spacings , two different physical volumes and two different quark actions .",
    "specifically we use an improved staggered action , `` asqtad , ''  @xcite and the overlap quark action .",
    "results from asqtad and overlap actions are in good agreement .",
    "we will compare our results to some model calculations and compare our chiral extrapolation with recent dyson  schwinger equation predictions .",
    "not only do we see stable infrared results , but the ultraviolet data is good enough for us to attempt estimates of the chiral condensate and the running quark mass .",
    "a much more detailed presentation can be found in ref .",
    "the quark propagator was also studied in laplacian gauge in ref .",
    "in the ( euclidean ) continuum , lorentz invariance allows us to decompose the full quark propagator into dirac vector and scalar pieces @xmath0 asymptotic freedom means that at large momentum transfer , @xmath1 , the quark propagator approaches its free form , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a current quark mass . on the lattice in the free case ( @xmath4 )",
    ", the quark propagator takes the form , @xmath5 where the function @xmath6 depends on the quark action . for the asqtad action it is  @xcite , @xmath7,\\ ] ] and for the overlap action it is  @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the regulator mass .",
    "these functions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_tree ]     vs.  @xmath11 for the overlap ( top curve ) and asqtad ( bottom curve ) quark actions .",
    "this is the inverse of the propagator for a massless quark .",
    "the diagonal line is the continuum case.,width=188 ]    the difference between eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont_free ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : latt_free ] ) is a pure lattice artefact . for the dirac vector piece",
    "this can be trivially corrected for by considering it to be a function not of @xmath12 , but of @xmath13 .",
    "this only affects the ultraviolet behaviour of @xmath14 , and asymptotic freedom means that we may hope that this correction will persist in the interacting case .",
    "this choice of `` kinematical momentum '' has been seen to be efficacious in the removal of hypercubic artefacts  @xcite and the philosophy is the same as that pursued with great success in studies of the gluon propagator  @xcite .",
    "tree - level correction does not prescribe such a procedure for the dirac scalar piece , @xmath15 , so we shall adopt an empirical approach .",
    "the simulation parameters are given in table  [ tab : lattices ] .",
    "in all cases an @xmath16 symanzik improved gluon action was used .",
    "the propagators were rotated to @xmath17-improved landau gauge @xcite by standard methods .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     having fit the asymptotic form to the quark mass function we should also be able to calculate the quark mass , but there is one piece of information missing from table  [ tab : asymp_fits ] . the effect of the bare quark mass on physical quantities is theory dependent ; we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of where the physical point lies .",
    "we can match a physical quantity to its real world value and thus extract the relevant bare mass for that particular action , with those particular lattice parameters .",
    "in this case we choose the asqtad quark action on the @xmath18 lattice at @xmath19 and set the `` physical '' bare quark mass by extrapolation to the physical pion mass .",
    "we fit the five lowest @xmath20 masses to the form @xmath21 the lowest order result from chiral perturbation theory . for the higher masses ,",
    "the data deviates from this form due to the contribution from higher order terms ; in the heavy quark limit @xmath22 . the u(1 ) chiral symmetry of staggered quarks ensures that there is no additive mass renormalisation . to find the physical point we find the bare mass corresponding to @xmath23 mev for each jackknife bin and get @xmath24 .",
    "then we fit the lowest four rgi masses in table  [ tab : asymp_fits ] to the form @xmath25 and find @xmath26 .",
    "putting these together we get @xmath27 the rgi quark mass in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_asymp ] ) is related to the running quark mass through eq .",
    "( [ eq : running ] ) .",
    "thus by choosing the renormalisation point @xmath28 gev and inserting @xmath29 mev , we get @xmath30 or with @xmath31 mev , @xmath32 this result compares favourably with the particle data group s number for the average of the up and down quark masses  @xcite , @xmath33    the curious behaviour of the condensate term at small masses is easily explained .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the quark mass function quickly becomes dominated by the explicit chiral symmetry breaking mass ; at the same time , large fluctuations make the mass function relatively noisy at these masses .",
    "together , that means that sensitivity of the fit to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_asymp ] ) is lost . at larger masses ,",
    "the signal becomes cleaner and statistical errors shrink , restoring stability to the fits .",
    "one way of countering this effect would be to fix @xmath34 for each light mass to some reasonable value given the chiral and heavy quark values .",
    "the difference to the end result would be small , but a future study should consider such systematics .",
    "this calculation is , of course , quenched .",
    "there are also systematic errors associated with the two extrapolations .",
    "using other observables to set the scale  such as the @xmath35 and nucleon masses , possibly supported by the appropriate finite - range regulated @xcite staggered chiral perturbation theory @xcite  would help us understand the systematic uncertainty associated with the extrapolation .",
    "such an approach could also provide a handle on the uncertainty associated with quenching .",
    "finally , we should realise that this is a rather audacious approach : we are exploiting ultraviolet physics on a relatively coarse lattice .",
    "it is very encouraging , however , that we are able to get such a promising result with such modest resources .",
    "the choices of improved quark and gauge actions are essential to this .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the quenched quark propagator in landau gauge is now in place .",
    "overlap and improved staggered actions produce propagators that are well behaved over a wide range of momenta . despite this",
    ", more points in the deep infrared are required to pin down precisely the behaviour near zero four - momentum .",
    "also , the role of finite volume effects in the @xmath14 function at small quark masses needs further investigation .",
    "calculations using dynamical configurations are underway .",
