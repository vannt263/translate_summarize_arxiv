    "both correlation coefficients decrease slightly when the effect of temperature is eliminated , which shows that a causal relation between the correlation length and the phase fraction may be present . on the other hand , @xmath115 for the tetragonal phase , which is higher than @xmath113 and thus a strong indication that the phase fraction indeed depends on the correlation length .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_t_vs_corr_l ] .",
    "+    , width=325 ]    to derive a possible explanation for this linear dependence , let us briefly reconsider the dependence of the octahedral tilting on the chemical short - range order .",
    "the influence of chemical short - range order on the stability of different tilt systems has been shown for pure nbt by density - functional - theory calculations.@xcite a crucial result of @xcite was that at ambient pressure , the local cation configurations designated as `` 110 '' , `` 11 - 01xy '' , and `` 111 '' favor out of phase @xmath12 tilts , whereas @xmath28 tilts are favored by local `` 10 - 01z '' , `` all3 + 1 '' , and `` 001 '' cation ordering . in agreement with levin and",
    "reaney,@xcite @xcite propose the existence of chemically ordered nanoregions with @xmath28 tilting , embedded in a rhombohedral matrix .",
    "as we have shown , no o - type srs are present in the case of nbt-3.6bt ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kl - scan ] ) .",
    "we therefore assume that the in - phase tilting in nbt-3.6bt occurs in tetragonal nanoregions with @xmath10 tilt order .",
    "this difference between nbt and nbt-3.6bt seems plausible considering that nbt-3.6bt is closer to the tetragonal phase field and , according to ma _",
    "et al._,@xcite even in a different phase field than pure nbt .",
    "+ since the local cation ordering is stable as long as cation diffusion is not activated , the tetragonal nanoregions remain fixed in space and it can be assumed that their number density does not change significantly with temperature .",
    "it can thus be said that the tetragonal platelets seem to be chemically pinned .",
    "in addition to this effect of the local na / bi ordering , the tilt structure depends strongly on the @xmath116 concentration,@xcite so that chemical inhomogeneity could add to the pinning effect in nbt - bt .",
    "coming back to the interpretation of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_t_vs_corr_l ] , it seems likely that the thickness of the tetragonal platelets varies most strongly with temperature , whereas their other dimensions remain constant .",
    "thus , the volume of the platelets would be a linear function of their thickness . neglecting the possibility of stacking faults along the tetragonal @xmath43 $ ] direction",
    ", the thickness of the platelets corresponds to the tilt correlation length .",
    "if the number density of the tetragonal platelets is finally assumed to be constant , a linear dependence of the phase fraction on the tilt correlation length would result .",
    "+ on this basis , a clear picture of the nanostructure can be drawn .",
    "the tetragonal platelets are distributed inhomogeneously in the crystal , as has been shown for pure nbt.@xcite at low temperatures , they are surrounded by large rhombohedral domains .",
    "the incompatibility of the tilt systems leads to a continuous transition , which in some cases involves a thin cubic layer at the interface . due to the reduced stability of the rhombohedral tilt system at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "the rhombohedral domains shrink , while the tetragonal platelets grow . at high temperatures ,",
    "some rhombohedral domains disappear and the tetragonal platelets begin to shrink . the cubic interface layers , which now surround all platelets , grow to coalesce into a continuous matrix .",
    "+        figure [ fig : t - dep_domains ] shows a model for the thermal evolution of the domain structure that was sketched in fig .  [ fig : domain_structure ] .",
    "the low cubic phase fraction at low to medium temperatures indicates that the tilt - free layers around the tetragonal platelets are very narrow , i.e. , about one unit cell thick . in many cases ,",
    "the tilt transition occurs on such a small length scale that all layers are distorted and a tilt - free layer does not occur at all . at high temperature ,",
    "the cubic phase becomes dominant and the rhombohedral phase disappears .",
    "this means that the observed reduction of the correlation length in the rhombohedral phase upon heating is only partly due to domain fragmentation within the rhombohedral regions , which has mainly been observed at low to intermediate temperatures.@xcite the continuous growth and coalescence of the tilt - free regions clearly leads to an additional reduction of the rhombohedral domain size due to the inward movement of the phase boundaries . +",
    "a very interesting structure - property relationship can be observed in the correlation between the dielectric permittivity @xmath117 and the squared correlation length of the tetragonal domains .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_rt ] . +     ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : permittivity ] ) and the squared correlation length @xmath118 of the tetragonal domains ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : elastic_fwhm_corr_l]).[fig : corr_rt],width=325 ]    it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_rt ] that the temperature dependences of the permittivity and the squared correlation length are very similar .",
    "this shows that the thickness of the tetragonal platelets may be of crucial importance for the dielectric properties of nbt - based relaxors . if the polarizability were constant throughout the tetragonal platelets , a linear dependence of @xmath117 on the volume fraction and thus on @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_t_vs_corr_l ] ) would be expected .",
    "the observation that @xmath117 is in fact proportional to @xmath118 could indicate that the local polarizability increases linearly with increasing distance from the undistorted cubic phase , i.e. , with increasing octahedral tilting .",
    "then @xmath117 , which is proportional to the volume integral of the local polarizability , would be proportional to @xmath118 , as we observe .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the tetragonal phase fraction increases upon poling and exhibits a more pronounced field - induced distortion.@xcite a similar , qualitative correlation between the composition - dependent volume fraction of the tetragonal phase and the piezoelectric properties of nbt - bt has previously been proposed in ref .  . since we could show that the volume fraction of the tetragonal phase is proportional to its correlation length , the findings of @xcite are also consistent with the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_rt ] .",
    "we have characterized the temperature dependence of the octahedral tilt order in nbt-3.6bt using elastic diffuse neutron scattering . in order to determine the volume fractions of the different octahedral tilt systems ,",
    "we have investigated the intensity of the associated superlattice reflections .",
    "we have found no indication that an orthorhombic component is present .",
    "the phase fractions of the rhombohedral , tetragonal , and cubic components depend strongly on the temperature : close to room temperature , the rhombohedral phase dominates , but the phase fraction decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "the tetragonal phase dominates in the intermediate temperature range . since the reduction of the tetragonal phase fraction at high temperature is not very pronounced",
    ", the macroscopically cubic phase still contains over 30  % of the tetragonal phase , 200  k above the @xmath35 phase transition .",
    "+ furthermore , we have derived the correlation lengths of the rhombohedral and tetragonal domains from the superlattice reflection profiles .",
    "we have found it necessary to include two components of the rhombohedral srs in the fitting model below 480  k , leading to two correlation lengths on different length scales .",
    "both correlation lengths of the rhombohedral domains decrease continuously with increasing temperature .",
    "the tetragonal domains undergo only small size changes between 6    and 15   , and thus remain consistently smaller than the rhombohedral domains .",
    "notably , the correlation length of the tetragonal domains exhibits the same temperature dependence as the tetragonal phase fraction .",
    "these results lead us to the conclusion that the nanostructure at ambient temperature features chemically pinned tetragonal platelets embedded in the rhombohedral matrix , often separated by a cubic intermediate phase .",
    "the thickness of the tetragonal platelets changes with temperature .",
    "the thickness of the cubic intermediate layers increases above the @xmath34 phase transition and leads to the coalescence of the cubic regions at high temperature , when the cubic phase is the dominant component of the matrix .",
    "the additional short range order in the rhombohedral phase below the macroscopic tetragonal to rhombohedral phase transition may be due to the soft @xmath112 phonon mode .",
    "+ we have also found clear indications that the dielectric permittivity is a function of the tetragonal platelet thickness squared .",
    "this correlation leads us to the conclusion that the tetragonal phase becomes more polarizable with increasing distance from the tilt - free interfaces .",
    "however , the composition dependence of the dielectric properties shows that a bulk tetragonal phase exhibits a weaker response than a two - phase mixture.@xcite thus , the lattice strain induced by the surrounding rhombohedral matrix may facilitate the field - induced distortions whithin the tetragonal phase , so that a two - phase system with a high density of platelets with intermediate thickness could exhibit the best dielectric properties in the nbt - bt system . due to the chemical pinning effect",
    ", the size and distribution of the tetragonal platelets can probably be influenced by the local chemical order .",
    "this means that controlling the chemical order may turn out to be an additional way of tailoring the dielectric properties of nbt - bt . + as a final remark , we would like to point out that our studies of the static structural features provide indications towards the atomistic origin of the temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "however , the frequency dependence of the permittivity at lower temperatures remains unexplained .",
    "inelastic - scattering studies might help to shed some light on the underlying dynamic processes .",
