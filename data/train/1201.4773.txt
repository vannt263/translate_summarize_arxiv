    "the presence of dust seems to be a ubiquitous property of galaxies throughout the observable universe .",
    "even the most distant quasars at @xmath8 show evidence for copious amounts of dust ( e.g. bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ; wang et al . 2008 ; leipski et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this indicates the rapid metal enrichment of the interstellar medium within the first billion years after the big bang . assuming that the observed far - infrared ( fir ) emission of these objects is powered by star - formation , the luminosies imply star formation rates of up to a few thousand solar masses per year , possibly indicating the rapid formation of early galactic bulges .    for a more comprehensive picture of the dust emission at high redshifts we are currently analyzing pacs ( 100 + 160@xmath9 m ) and spire ( 250 + 350 + 500@xmath9 m ) photometry of 71 quasars at @xmath0 that have been obtained as part of our _ herschel _ key project `` the dusty young universe ''",

    "spitzer _ data at shorter wavelengths were secured by our group to enable the study of the full optical through infrared sed of a large sample of quasars in the early universe .",
    "in the course of this project we have now identified a number of high-@xmath10 ( @xmath0 ) quasars with considerable fir emission .",
    "they are clearly detected in our pacs and spire observations and were previously unknown to have large infrared luminosities ( fig.1 ) . in combination with our existing _",

    "_ left _ : the quasar sed was fitted by a linear combination of the sdss quasar template ( richards et al . 2006 ) and a modified black body ( representing dust emission from star formation ) . despite a reasonable match in the rest frame",
    "uv / optical and in the fir , there exist a clear discrepancy between @xmath7@xmath12 m . ]",
    "most powerful agn are strong sources of infrared radiation .",
    "this emission originates from dust heated by the accretion disk to various temperatures depending on its distance from the nucleus and its spatial distribution .",
    "in such a configuration , the sublimation temperature of the dust ( @xmath71500k ) sets the inner boundary of the dust distribution in agn .",
    "the dust at these temperatures predominately re - emits the absorbed energy in the rest frame near infrared .",
    "thus , the spectral energy distribution in this regime provides us with a tool to study the agn dust only a few parsec out from the core .    using _ herschel _ data and archival information",
    ", we noticed that common agn templates ( like the sdss quasar template , richards et al .",
    "2006 ) do not match the amounts of hot dust emission between @xmath7110@xmath9 m in the uv / optical through sub - mm sed of the @xmath13 quasar sdssj1148 + 5251 ( leipski et al .",
    "2010 ; fig.1 ) .",
    "interestingly , in the wavelength range where the discrepancy is most apparent ( @xmath7@xmath14@xmath9 m ) , the sed is particularly sensitive to the radial distribution of the innermost dust ( however , this is not the only parameter that can influence the shape of the sed in this region ; see schartmann et al .",
    "2008 , hnig & kishimoto 2010 ) .",
    "the observed mismatch might be due to sdssj1148 + 5251 being exceptional with a very high redshift ( @xmath13 ) and having extreme luminosity ( l@xmath15@xmath7@xmath16erg / s ) .",
    "it is conceivable to assume that the dust distribution might be sensitive to the total luminosity of the heating source ( i.e. the accretion disk ) or even the evolutionary state of the system ( i.e. high-@xmath10 vs. low-@xmath10 ) .",
    "the sdss template is largely dominated by quasars around a redshift of @xmath17 .",
    "only few objects at @xmath18 are included .",
    "furthermore , while all objects have sdss and _ spitzer _ irac data available , many objects lack nir photometry ( which was in these cases determined from scaling the elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) quasar template to the nearest observed data point ) .",
    "however , for a robust comparison with our @xmath0 quasar seds  in particular with an emphasis on slope in the hot dust component  we need a sample that provides appropriate numbers of high - redshift quasars with observational data that cover the typical `` 1@xmath9 m inflection '' in the quasar seds and sample the onset of the hot dust emission .",
    "in addition , the indidviual seds used to construct the sdss template have been corrected for host galaxy contributions ( see richards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for details ) which has the largest effect ( @xmath735% host contribution ) in the rest frame nir where the assumed elliptical host sed peaks .    in order to build template seds that cover higher redshifts at various luninosities , we here use as a starting point the dr7 sdss quasar sample presented by shen et al .",
    "these authors also provide their quasar table matched with the preliminary data release from the wise ( wright et al .",
    "2010 ) mir survey .",
    "this results in @xmath736000 quasars with sdss optical phtometry and wise mir detections in three bands ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12@xmath9 m ; we here do not consider the 22@xmath9 m band in which many objects are not detected ) .",
    "we further limited the objects to redshifts greater than 2.5 so that the wise photometry samples the hot dust part of the rest - frame quasar sed . from the remaining sources we then created mean seds in a fairly straight forward manner by first de - redshifting the sources into the rest frame , then interpolating them linearly in log space onto a common wavelength grid , normalzing them at 1@xmath9 m ( rest frame ) and eventually calculating the mean for various subsamples .",
    "we then compared these mean seds with our sample ( fig.2 ) .",
    "specifically , we searched for trends with increasing redshift ( at fixed luminosity ) or with luminosity ( at fixed redshift ) .",
    "a few important findings are :    * we see quite a large spread in sed shapes for our sample as well as in the comparison samples after normalization , which results in substantial error bars ( here : mean absolute deviation ) .",
    "such a spread of quasar seds was also seen by e.g. elvis et al .",
    "1994 and richards et al .",
    "2006 in their studies . *",
    "no trend ( within the errors ) is observed when increasing the luminosity over 2 orders of magnitude ( @xmath710@xmath1910@xmath20 ) while keeping the redshift bin fixed ( @xmath21 ) . *",
    "equally no trend ( within the errors ) can be found with redshift between @xmath22 when using only sources at comparable luminosity to the high-@xmath10 objects .",
    "this implies that the hot dust properties do not change significantly with either redshift or luminosity for the parameter space considered here .",
    "in fact , the diversity of individual quasar seds appears much greater than any differences between the sample mean values .",
    "we stress , however , that this study and the results presented here have to be considered preliminary .",
    "we are currently looking into expanding the observational data base for the quasars by including nir photometery from the ukidss survey .",
    "this will allow us to expand this study to even lower redshifts while still appropriately sampling the hot - dust part of the sed .",
    "also , no correction for host galaxy contributions has been performed at this point which could be especially important for the lower luminosity objects .",
    "such a correction could potentially influence the spectral shape in the nir where the stellar population of an elliptical galaxy of old or intermediate age is brightest .",
    "in fact , in a recent mir interferometric study , kishimoto et al .",
    "( 2011 ) report a steepening of the radial dust distribution in the innermost few parsec with increasing luminosity . in the seds",
    "this would translate into a steeper nir spectral slope for objects at higher luminosity which indicates that a carefull accounting of the host galaxy contribution may prove to be important for the less luminous sources .",

    "2003 ; wang et al . 2008 ) .",
    "such studies suggest that most of the rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) emission comes from massive star formation , possibly indicating the formation of early galactic bulges .",
    "thus , these objects signify an important stage in the connection between the build - up of stellar mass and black hole growth .    however , for the vast majority of high - redshift objects we lack full fir / sub - mm spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "far - infraed luminosities ( l@xmath3 ) and dust masses ( m@xmath24 ) are commonly determined using single photometric measurements ( typically at 250ghz ) and applying standard values for the dust temperature as determined from lower redshift objects .",
    "but the questions remains how far these assumptions are appropriate for the high - redshift objects .    from our new photometry providing full sed information in the rest frame wavelength range @xmath11 m",
    ", we have discovered seven quasars at @xmath0 with considerable fir excess emission , including sdssj1148 + 5251 for which strong fir and mm emission has been reported previously ( e.g. bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 , beelen et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to extract additional information from the seds",
    ", we fitted the observed photometry with a linear combination of a power - law in the uv / optical / nir ( emission from the accretion disk ) , a clumpy torus model ( agn heated dust from hnig & kishimoto ( 2010 ) ) , and a modified black body ( starburst - powered excess dust emission ) .",
    "the emmissivity value @xmath25 for this last component was fixed to a value of 1.6 to be comparable to previous studies at high @xmath10 . in all cases the additional fir component was required to describe the observed seds at the longest wavelengths ( see fig.3 for a few examples ) .",
    "these sed fits also allow us to determine quantative parameters : first , the scaling of the torus dust emission can be converted into the bolometric luminosity required to power the observed emission ( hnig & kishimoto 2010 ) . for the sources considered here we find",
    "l@xmath15=@xmath26erg / s using this approach .",
    "these bolometric luminosities translate into dust sublimation radii of @xmath7@xmath27pc .",
    "we also see that in the combined fits , torus models with steep radial dust distributions are preferred , indicating that most of the dust resides close to the nucleus . integrating only the fir excess component between 8 and 1000@xmath9 m",
    "we determine luminosities of @xmath410@xmath5l@xmath6 .",
    "if we identify this component as being powered by star formation then we observe star formation rates of the order of a few times 10@xmath28 solar masses per year in these early quasar host galaxies . for sdssj1148 + 5251",
    "the star - formation rate we determine from the sed fits is consistent with the results from a [ cii ] imaging study ( walter et al .",
    "these spatially resolved observations also show that the bulk of the detected star formation takes place in the innermost 1.5kpc of the host galaxy .",
    "one interesting fact related to the fir excess emission is that the temperature of this component in all sources is fairly high ( t@xmath765k ) , much higher than the t@xmath745k typically found for lower redshift objects ( e.g. beelen et al .",
    "this latter value is commonly used to extrapolate from the 250ghz measurements in high - redshift quasars ( e.g. wang et al . 2008 ) . since",
    "the determination of dust masses is quite sensitive to the temperature of the dust , the measured difference in fir temperatures could potentially have an impact on the dust masses derived for the high - redshift quasars .",
    "our multi - wavelength imaging allows us to check for possible confusion with other ( lower redshift ) fir bright sources which could contribute in the large spire beams and mimick the higher fir dust temperatures .",
    "no such confusion problems could readily be identified , at least on scales of a few arc seconds .",
    "we might also have to consider quasar heating of the dust as a possible soure to raise the temperature of fir emitting dust .",
    "the very luminous agn puts out copious amounts of radiation which in principle might be able to heat dust in the host galaxy to the temperatures we observe .",
    "in such a case , only some fraction of the fir luminosity will actually be powered by star formation and in our calculations above we would overestimate the star - formation rates in these objects .",
    "a more detailed analysis of these highly interesting sources is currently underway ( leipski et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) and follow - up strategies have been initiated .",
