    "circa 2001 , we thought we had identified where the `` dark ages '' ended , when the first sources of light in the universe turned on with sufficient strength to dissociate the hydrogen atoms formed when the universe was only @xmath9300,000 years old .",

    "this appears inconsistent with reionization occuring at @xmath11 .",
    "however , since a relatively small neutral fraction ( @xmath12 ) suffices to produce black gunn - peterson troughs , the microwave results are not necessarily contradictory with the quasar results : perhaps reionization began early , and only completed around redshift @xmath11 . on the other hand , wyithe & loeb ( 2004a ) and mesinger & haiman ( 2004 ) note that the sizes of the region around the highest redshift quasars provide a stronger constraint on the igm neutral fraction , implying @xmath13 for typical quasar lifetimes",
    "there is mounting evidence that the ionization history of the igm is complex ; see , loeb & barkana ( 2001 ) , barkana & loeb ( 2001 ) , and miralda - escud ( 2003 ) for recent reviews .",
    "several theorists have argued that the hydrogen in the igm could have been reionized twice ( wyithe & loeb 2003 ; cen 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; somerville , bullock , & livio 2003 ) .",
    "a first reionization occurs at @xmath14 , driven by the formation of massive , zero - metallicity population  iii stars ( bromm 2004 ) .",
    "however , their radiative and mechanical feedback may have disrupted the subsequent star formation , possibly leading to a partial recombination until an increasing population  ii massive star population and declining igm density allow the second reionization to occur at @xmath11 , as indicated by the high - redshift quasar spectroscopic measurements .",
    "how and when reionization(s ) happened , and the details of the reionization process , have been among the most pressing questions in astrophysical cosmology , holding many clues about the first generation of light sources .",
    "high - redshift  emitters offer a complementary approach to studying the early reionization history of the igm .",
    "it has long been suggested that the first sources of ultraviolet radiation , responsible for the reionization of the universe , should be strong  emitters ( partridge & peebles 1967 ) .",
    "after several decades of largely unsuccessful searches ( for a review , see pritchet 1994 ) , numerous  emitters are finally being discovered at high redshifts ( dey et  al .",

    "the most distant sources , confirmed out to @xmath15 ( kodaira et  al .",
    "2003 ) , are seen _ prior _ to the quasar - derived reionization redshift of the igm .",
    "since photons injected into a neutral igm are strongly scattered , the red damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough should strongly suppress , or even completely eliminate , detectable  emission ( miralda - escud & rees 1998 ; miralda - escud 1998 ; loeb & rybicki 1999 ; barkana & loeb 2004 ; gnedin & prada 2004 ) .",
    "initially it was thought that small -emitting galaxies embedded in a neutral igm would be incapable of ionizing enough of their surroundings to prevent this effect , thus implying that the detection of even a _ single _",
    "-emitting galaxy requires that the reionization epoch occurs at a higher redshift .",
    "subsequent calculations ( haiman 2002 ) , however , show that even for faint sources with little ionizing continuum , a sufficiently broad ( @xmath16 ) emission line can remain observable .",
    "the transmitted fraction depends upon the size of the local cosmological region surrounding a source , and therefore on the ionizing luminosity and age of the source ( santos 2004 ) as well as on contributions from associated , clustered sources ( wyithe & loeb 2004b ) .",
    "nevertheless , we expect a rapid decline in the observed space density of  emitters as the reionization epoch is approached : a statistical sample of emitters spanning the reionization redshift should still be a useful probe of reionization ( haiman & spaans 1999 ; rhoads & malhotra 2001 ; haiman 2002 )",
    ". however , such an effect may be detectable only for the fainter sources , and it depends on many as - yet unknown details about the geometry of reionization , intrinsic evolution of the ly@xmath17 luminosity function , as well as the winds and environment of high - redshift  emitters .    here",
