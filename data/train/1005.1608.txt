    "we see that if @xmath23 , then there is a  constant @xmath24 so that the time @xmath25 , until everyone knows the information , satisfies @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes convergence in probability .    to simplify things",
    ", we will remove the randomness from the nearest neighbor part of the process , and formulate it on the ( real ) torus @xmath28 .",
    "one should be able to prove a similar result for the first passage percolation model but there are two difficulties .",
    "the first and easier to handle is that the limiting shape is not round .",
    "the second and more difficult issue is that the growth is not deterministic but has fluctuations .",
    "one should be able to handle both of these problems , but the proof is already long enough .",
    "we consider what we call the `` balloon process , '' in which the state of the process at time @xmath1 is @xmath29 .",
    "it starts with one `` center '' chosen uniformly from the torus at time 0 .",
    "when a center is born at @xmath30 , a disk with radius 0 is put there , and its radius grows deterministically as @xmath31 , so that the area of the disk at time @xmath7 after its birth is @xmath32 . if the area covered at time @xmath1 is @xmath33 , then births of new centers occur at rate @xmath34 .",
    "the location of each new center is chosen uniformly from the torus .",
    "if the new point lands at @xmath35 , it will never contribute anything to the growth of the set , but we will count it in the total number of centers , which we denote by @xmath36 .    before turning to the details of our analysis",
    "we would like to point out that a related balloon process was used by barbour and reinert ( @xcite ) in their study of distances on the small world graph .",
    "consider a circle of radius @xmath37 and introduce a poisson mean @xmath38 number of chords with length  0 connecting randomly chosen points on the circle . to study the distance between a fixed point @xmath39 and a point chosen at random one wants to examine @xmath40 .",

    "we will be concerned with @xmath45 . to begin we will get rid of trivial cases .",
    "if the diameter of @xmath46 grows linearly , then @xmath47 .",

    "long range births occur at rate equal to the area of @xmath61 and are dispersed uniformly . since the distance from @xmath64 to @xmath65 is @xmath66 , if there are no long range births before time @xmath67 or if all long range births land inside @xmath61 then the torus is covered at time @xmath58 .",
    "computing the distribution of the cover time when it is @xmath68 is complicated , but the answer is a continuous functional of the limit process , and standard weak convergence results give the result .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we suppose @xmath45 with @xmath69 .",
