    "there is a wide range of photometrically variable systems in the universe .",
    "the range of timescales on which these systems vary is as wide as the physical processes that produce their variability .",
    "for example we have intrinsically variable stars , where the variability is caused by changes in their internal structure or atmosphere that vary with timescales of minutes to years @xcite .",
    "other stars show variability because they rotate and their surface is inhomogeneous , e.g. because of star spots , @xcite , or because they form part of a binary or multiple system and their revolution around the centre of mass of the system results in changes on the detected flux due to the changing aspect of a non - isotropically emitting surface or eclipses .",
    "this is also the case for planets orbiting stars .",
    "the timescale of the variability in this case is dictated by the orbital parameters of the system and can range from seconds to years . near earth objects ( neos ) , such as asteroids , also show variability as they rotate and are non - spherical .",
    "we find photometric variability in extragalactic objects as well , such as quasars , where the variability is probably the result of material being accreted by the central engine , or `` one of '' systems such as gamma ray bursts ( grb ) or supernovae ( sne ) where the variability is produced by intrinsic changes in the structure of an astronomical object that take place only once .",
    "the study of variability provides important information about the physical nature of the variable objects , leads to the discovery of new classes of objects , helps to study the physical structure of stars , e.g. pulsating stars , allows us to obtain information on galactic structure through the use of variables such as rr  lyrae as standard candles , and is the key to determining extra - galactic distances through the use of standard candles such as cepheids and supernovae type ia .",
    "most of our knowledge of variability is based on the study of apparently bright sources , which naturally selects members of _ intrinsically _ bright populations . at present little",
    "is known about variability of intrinsically fainter populations because in bright samples they are lacking altogether or are only represented by a few members . the faint sky variability survey ( fsvs ;",
    "groot et al . )",
    "was designed to account for this deficit by studying two unexplored regions of the variability space : the short timescale variability region ( down to tens of minutes ) and the intrinsically faint variable sources ( down to v = 24 mag ) at mid and high galactic latitudes .",
    "the fsvs also contains colour information for all targets , giving us the option of positioning objects in the colour - colour diagram as well as finding the variability timescales and amplitudes that characterise them .",
    "the main aims of the fsvs are thus to obtain a map of a region of the galaxy ( @xmath021deg@xmath1 ) in variability and colour space , to determine the population density of the different variable objects that reside in the galaxy and to find the photometric signature of up - to - now unknown intrinsically faint variable populations . in this paper",
    "we explore these three goals .",
    "there are other surveys that study the variable optical sky , each emphasising one aspect or one particular region of this parameter space .",
    "the timescales sampled , depth and sky coverage of different variability surveys varies depending on the astronomical objects they are designed to study . for example , with a brightness limit similar to the fsvs , street et al .",
    "study the variability around an open cluster with timescales longer than a few hours , and ramsay &  hakala study the rapid variability ( down to 2 minutes ) of objects as faint as v@xmath022.5 . of great interest",
    "is the deep lens survey ( dls ) that , in a similar way to the fsvs , combines colour and variability information and explores similar variability timescales @xcite .",
    "becker et al . also provide a comprehensive review of past and on - going variability surveys .",
    "the future of optical variability surveys looks quite promising with the advent of large aperture telescopes such as the large - aperture synoptic survey 8.4 m telescope @xcite , the 4 m telescope vista and the 2.5 m vlt survey telescope .",
    "the full faint sky variability survey ( fsvs ) data set consists of 78 wide field camera ( wfc ) fields taken with the isaac newton telescope ( int ) at la palma .",
    "the fsvs covers an area in the sky of @xmath021deg@xmath1 located at mid and high galactic latitudes ( @xmath240@xmath3@xmath221 , 15@xmath350 , 89@xmath390 ) .",
    "the wfc is a moisac of four 2kx4k ccds . for each field",
    ", we took one set of b , i and v band observations on a given photometric night .",
    "photometric variability observations were taken with the v filter on several consecutive nights .",
    "on average , fields were observed 10  20 times within one week in the v band .",
    "exposure times were 10 min with a dead time between observations of 2 min .",
    "this observing pattern allows us to sample periodicity timescales from 2@xmath4(observing time + dead time ) ( i.e. 24 min ) to twice the maximum time separation of observations ( which ranges from 3 days to 13 days ) . see for more details groot et al . .",
    "all fields were re - observed years later to determine proper motions . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the shorter timescale variability ( from 0.4 hours to a few days ) of the targets and we do not include those observations .",
    ".journal of observations .",
    "the number of v band observations taken for each field , not counting those taken about a year later for proper motion studies , as well as the maximum time interval covered in days , @xmath5 , are given . for field 48 ,",
    "the two v band measurements were taken more than a year apart . for field 51 ,",
    "two measurements were lost in one of the ccds .",
    "the fraction of variable sources ( fv ) x100 per field found using the @xmath6 test is also given .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in sections  [ an : chisq ] and [ res : varnovar ] .",
    "notice that the fraction of variables found in fields 36 , and 48 , is very high compared to the rest of the fields .",
    "these fields were only observed in 2 occasions so their variability @xmath6 was calculated based only on 2 points .",
    "this is also the case for fields 35 , and 41 to 45 but they do not show a fraction of variables as large .",
    "these 6 fields contain about twice the number of stars compared to fields 36 and 48 . [",

    "[ res : example : fig1 ] presents the lightcurves for two example sources found in our data .",
    "the examples have only been selected to illustrate two very different samplings .",
    "the first example corresponds to one of the candidate rr  lyr ( see section  [ res : ccdiag ] ) for which we determined a period of 6.34h from the floating mean periodogram .",
    "the second example corresponds to a source with very blue colours , for which we have obtained spectra that suggests it is a subdwarf b star .",
    "the period measured for this system , which probably corresponds to its orbital period in a binary system , is 4.95h . for both sources we present the measurements as a function of phase folded at the period determined from the floating mean periodogram .",
    "the best sinusoidal fit to the data is also plotted .",
    "the fsvs covers a region in the sky in which there are two known cataclysmic variables , go  com and v394  lyr .",
    "these two sources were identified as variables in both the @xmath6 and the floating mean periodogram tests .",
    "interestingly enough , both of them went into outburst during the observations which made it more difficult to determine their orbital periods .",
    "go  com was observed in three different epochs and it rose by a magnitude in v from the second to the third epoch ( from 19.4 to 18.5 ) . in an attempt to subtract the outburst contribution to the variability , and thus to be able to measure its orbital period , we calculated its average brightness for each epoch and subtracted the average from the measurements taken on that epoch .",
    "when we run the floating mean periodogram on the resulting lightcurve we obtain a periodogram with two main groups of aliases , one centred in 30min and another on 90min .",
    "the sampling of the lightcurve does not allow us to determine the period with more accuracy than this .",
    "the second alias lies near the 94.8min period determined by howell et al . .",
    "v394  lyr was observed in 7 epochs and it rose by two magnitudes in v from the first to the sixth ( from 19.1 to 17 ) starting to decrease on the the seventh .",
    "we followed the same steps outlined above for go  com and found the lower @xmath6 aliases to be 43min and 4.32h .",
    "there are no measurements of the orbital period of v394  lyr in the literature that we can compare these values with .",
    "the folded lightcurves on these two periods do not look convincing which lead us to think that none of these are the true orbital period of the system .",
    "a third of the variable point sources found in the fsvs using the @xmath6 test were not detected either in b , i or in both b and i bands . in a handful of cases",
    "this was due to the point source being close to the ccd boundary , in 21 percent of the cases the source appeared as blended with another one , in 28 per cent of the cases the source was not detected because it was too faint , and in 50 per cent of the cases the source was saturated in the i band .",
    "most of these sources saturated in the i band are very bright in the three bands ( 71 percent ) indicating that about one sixth of the variable sources found are at the bright end of the survey .",
    "this is expected as most variables probably show low amplitude variations which are easier to detect for bright sources . in the case of the blended sources ,",
    "blending would most probably affect the v band magnitudes perhaps introducing spurious variability .",
    "on the other hand , 29 percent of the sources undetected in b and/or i , do show larger colour differences , ( b@xmath2i)@xmath73 and up to 5 magnitudes in some cases .",
    "colour differences of ( b@xmath2i)@xmath73 are expected for some main sequence stars and do not imply that we are dealing with extreme colour objects .",
    "the lower limit colours calculated for these sources ( by assuming their i band magnitude is equivalent to the i band magnitude of the brightest unsaturated star in the field ) fill an area of the colour space , which is also filled by the point sources that were detected ( unsaturated ) in the three bands .",
    "this indicates that , although their colours are more extreme , they are not unusual compared with the sources detected in all three bands , they are just brighter and therefore saturated in the i band .    the same analysis carried out in section  [ res : timeamp ] for point sources with b , i and v detections , and more than 4 v measurements can be carried out for 154 sources with no b and/or i detections . in these cases",
    "the information we have of the variable sources is only their timescales and amplitudes and not their colours .",
    "once we discard sources for which their calculated periods and amplitudes lie outside the trustable ranges determined in section  [ an : fmp ] for each field , we are left with 71 short period variable sources .",
    "we find that 29.5 per cent of the variables with 30 per cent accuracy in their periods and amplitudes show periods between 0.4 and 6 hours , 39.3 per cent between 6 hours and 1 day , 21.3 per cent between 1 and 4 days , and 9.8 per cent of more than 4 days .",
    "these values are slightly different ( 19 , 23.8 , 33.3 and 23.8 respectively ) if we consider the 21 sources where the periods and amplitudes determined have errors of less than 10 per cent . when we compare this distribution of variables in period bins with the one we found for systems with b and i measurements ( 50 , 22 20 , 8 per cent respectively for each period bin )",
    ", we find that the number of shorter period variables ( first period range ) is smaller for the sources with no b and/or i detections and the number of variables in the last two period bins is larger .",
    "we have analysed the short timescale variability information contained in the fsvs and find that about 1 per cent of all point sources are variable . of those variables ,",
    "about 50 per cent show variability timescales shorter than 6 hours , 22 per cent show variabilities between 6 hours and 1 day , 20 per cent between 1 and 4 days and 8 per cent show periods longer than 4 days .",
    "the distribution of variables with spectral type is fairly constant along the main sequence , with 1 per cent of all the sources being variable , except at the blue end of the main sequence where the fraction of variable sources increases possibly due to contamination by non main sequence sources . above the main sequence , beyond the blue cut - off at ( b@xmath2v)@xmath80.38",
    ", we find that the fraction of variables increases to 3.5 percent .    the highest space density of variables found in the fsvs ( i.e. 17 per deg@xmath1 ) show periods below 12 hours . these include cvs , rr  lyr stars , and other short period pulsators such as @xmath9scuti stars .",
    "we find a density of 4 variables per deg@xmath1 centred at a 1 day period which includes longer period cvs , rr  lyr and other pulsators like @xmath10doradus stars and pop ii cepheids .",
    "a space density of 2 variables per deg@xmath1 at 3.75 days includes , some longer period cvs , @xmath10doradus stars , pop ii cepheids and longer period pulsators such as subdwarf b stars . at 12.75 days",
    "we also find 2 variables per deg@xmath1 .",
    "these would be mainly binaries with those orbital periods and pop ii cepheids .",
    "it is easier to compare these space densities with those expected for the mentioned populations when we combine the period information with the colours of the populations under study .",
    "the case of cvs and many pulsators is complicated as they appear mixed through several period and colour ranges and in many cases it is necessary to obtain spectra to confirm the nature of the variable source .",
    "the space densities of cvs and subdwarf b stars will be studied in detail in a future paper . in the case of rr lyr stars ,",
    "we find 3 certain members and 9 other candidates down to v = 21.6 .",
    "assuming we have detected all rr lyr between v = 1622 , we determine a space density of @xmath010@xmath11kpc@xmath11 in agreement with the space density determined by preston , shectman &  beers at a distance of 100150kpc from the galactic centre .    by using the floating mean periodogram",
    ", we have determined the most likely periods and amplitudes of a fraction of the variables found in the fsvs .",
    "we find that we are complete down to v = 22 for cvs in the minimum period ( 80 min ) as long as they show variability amplitudes of the order of 0.4 mag .",
    "we are complete down to v = 22 for periods between 80 min and 1 day in a 17.82deg@xmath1 area of the survey as long as the amplitude of the variability is at least 0.7 mag .",
    "this includes most rr lyr stars .",
    "we will be able to detect rr lyr also down to v = 23 when their variability amplitudes are at least 1.5 mag .",
