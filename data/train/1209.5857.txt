    "potassium ( k ) atom is one of the suitable alkali atoms whose two stable isotopes are fermions and one of them is boson that makes it a special system for cold atom studies @xcite .",
    "studies of its transition properties are very useful in manipulating trapping and cooling of this atom @xcite . especially to find out its `` magic wavelengths '' at which the differential stark shifts of a transition become zero @xcite , accurate knowledge of transition properties are necessary @xcite .",
    "sophisticated experiments are generally performed to measure these magic wavelengths @xcite , however they can also be determined precisely by evaluating differential polarizabilities using accurate relativistic many - body methods @xcite .",
    "in fact , k atom is an one valence electron system , whose properties can be evaluated precisely that can ultimately act as benchmark tests for the experimental results . also , a suitable trapping technique of alkali atoms is very much useful in various fields like in the atomic clock , quantum computing , quantum information etc",

    "the atoms are trapped by a periodic potential formed by the applied laser beam @xcite for which the trapped atoms interact with the oscillating electric field of the trapping beam that causes the shift in the energy levels inside the atoms .",
    "but in order to achieve maximum stability of an atomic clock , it is very crucial to tune the laser beam at a particular wavelength such that there will be no effects to the internal clock transition frequency @xcite .",
    "these effects can be estimated by estimating dynamic polarizabilities of the atomic states @xcite .",
    "accurate values of transition properties in k are also useful in the astrophysical studies @xcite .",
    "k is produced in massive stars after oxygen burning and its isotopes abundances are analyzed in 58 metal - poor stars . in these analysis , theoretical estimate of ratios of abundances of [ k / fe ] with [ fe / h ] during the chemical evolution of galaxy",
    "are compared with the observations @xcite .",
    "there are also various astrophysical objects such as l dwarfs , t dwarfs and irradiated giant planets whose spectra are dominated by absorption lines of many alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "many telescopes operating at various wavelengths from ultraviolet ( uv ) to infrared ( ir ) range are used to study various spectral properties of astronomical objects , but these ir telescopes require information about detailed spectroscopic data of atomic systems such as oscillator strengths , transition probabilities etc . @xcite . also ,",
    "identification of new ir lines will be useful in understanding equilibrium temperature , gravity and abundance for many ultra - cool dwarf stars as well as extra solar giant planets in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore it is always very useful to have enough atomic information on new ir atomic lines based on high precision relativistic calculations , so that they can be used in the analysis of spectral measurements generally carried out by sophisticated ir telescopes .    in this paper , we evaluate electric dipole ( e1 ) matrix elements and determine oscillator strengths , transition probabilities , branching ratios , lifetimes and polarizabilities of many states of k atom .",
    "furthermore , we determine the magic wavelengths due to the linearly polarized light for the @xmath4 and @xmath3 transitions and compare them with the available results .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sections ii and iii , we give the theories of transition probability due to allowed transition and linear stark shift and describe briefly about the method of calculation . in the next section , we present the results and discuss about them . unless stated otherwise , we use atomic unit ( a.u . ) for all the physical properties through out the paper .",
