    "the progress in fabrication of submicron structures has lead to a wealth of new structures whose transport properties are dominated by the feature that electronic transport through the structure takes place coherently .",
    "however , additional degrees of freedom in addition to those of single electrons are present and it is of importance to account for their influence on coherent processes . in the following",
    "we shall investigate how different environmental states influence the quantum process of main interest . although we shall choose a model which is directly relevant to transport properties of a double barrier structure or transport through a quantum dot , the technique we develop is of general interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we model the system whose transport properties will be studied , and in section [ sec : trans ] we show how to describe the transmission probability of a structure in terms of green s functions . in section [ sec : csd ] we discuss the main approximation , which will allow an analytical description of the influence of dissipation on the transmission properties . in section [ sec : path ] we introduce the closed time path formulation and develop the description of the destruction of phase coherence in terms of a generating functional technique , and in section [ sec : environments ] we discuss the effects of different environmental states : thermal and coherent states , the external field case , and the fluctuating level model .",
    "we shall for all these cases derive closed expressions for the transmission probabilities , and compare the results in order to notice similarities and differences in the influence of different environments . in section [ sec : destruction ] we discuss destruction of phase coherence using the generic aharonov - bohm situation .",
    "finally in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "in this section we shall set up a minimal model describing the dissipative feature of the general quantum transport problem .",
    "the simplifications are introduced in order to be able to treat analytically the influence of environments on the transport process .",
    "we shall study the general problem of quantum transport where electronic current reservoirs provide electrons to an active region where interaction with an environment can take place .",
    "the reservoirs corresponds in reality to large electrodes , and we can describe the hamiltonians for the left and right electrodes in terms of their electron energy levels @xmath0 the quantum number @xmath1 labels the momentum of the electron states , and @xmath2 refers to the left and right electrode , respectively , and @xmath3 creates particles in states with these quantum numbers with the corresponding energy @xmath4 .    the central active ( sample )",
    "region can in the absence of coupling to the reservoirs be described by a hamiltonian or equivalently its energy levels .",
    "the single particle energy at the central site , labeled @xmath5 , is @xmath6 corresponding to the term in the hamiltonian @xmath7    in the following we shall consider a model which allows extensive analytical calculations , and therefore restrict the number of levels relevant in the central region to one . eventually we shall consider also the case of two levels . in the event that the reservoirs are connected through the central site ,",
    "electrons are transmitted between them .",
    "such a situation can quite generally be modeled by transfer matrix elements,@xmath8 , between the reservoirs and the central region .",
    "the coupling of the electrodes to the central site is therefore described by the tunneling hamiltonian @xcite @xmath9 the transfer matrix elements are here considered to be phenomenological parameters , but can of course for any chosen microscopic model of say a double barrier , be expressed in terms of the potential profile and the carrier mass .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath10 , for the electronic system of interest is therefore given by @xmath11    within the sample region we allow for interaction with an environment",
    ". for our purpose we can quite generally assume a bosonic environment with a corresponding hamiltonian @xmath12 which has the standard normal mode form @xmath13 in terms of the bosonic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    for the coupling of an electron at the central site",
    "we take a linear coupling to the normal modes @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the collective environment displacement operator @xmath18 and @xmath19 the coupling constant to mode @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian for system and environment @xmath21 has been discussed in a variety of contexts @xcite , most recently in the context of inelastic resonant tunneling @xcite , where the model has served as a simplified description of the influence of interaction with phonons on the transport properties of a double barrier structure . in the present account we shall not only discuss a thermal environment , but a variety of environmental states and their influence .",
    "a purpose of the paper is to present a calculational scheme that allow a unified description of arbitrary environments , and in a direct way exhibits the physical content of a model so that calculations within more realistic models can be made tractable .",
    "we now proceed to describe in detail the transmission properties of the system under consideration .",
    "in mesoscopic physics where the main feature of electronic transport is its coherence , the transport description can be expressed in terms of the scattering properties of the mesoscopic structure .",
    "the choice of model has been dictated by this feature , and in the following we shall study the quantum mechanical problem of transmission of an electron through a region where it can interact with additional degrees of freedom .",
    "we wish , therefore , to calculate the transmission coefficient for a particle emitted , say , from the left reservoir under the assumption that it propagates via the central site , where it is allowed to interact with an environment , to the right reservoir . in accordance with the initial condition of an electron impinging from the left reservoir",
    ", we can assume that at some initial time @xmath22 the two subsystems , particle and environment , are decoupled , so that the initial state is described by a separable statistical operator @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the projection operator describing an electron in the left electrode in momentum state @xmath25 @xmath26 the state of the environment is presently arbitrary and described by the statistical operator @xmath27 .",
    "as regards the transmission problem , given the above initial state , all information can be extracted from the probability , @xmath28 , to find the electron in the right electrode at time t with momentum @xmath1 .",
    "this conditional probability is given by the expression @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the projection operator @xmath31 corresponding to the assumed final outgoing particle state with momentum @xmath1 in the right electrode , and @xmath32 is the evolution operator corresponding to the total hamiltonian .",
    "the trace with respect to all the degrees of freedom is denoted by tr .",
    "the absence of any environment operator discriminating the final states of the environment is in accordance with the typical experimental condition pertaining to the electronic conduction process , namely that the environmental degrees of freedom are not observed .    for an electron to propagate between the reservoirs it first has to enter the sample region and",
    "lastly to exit it . in the event we only explicitly consider interaction with the environment in the sample region , we can exploit this feature and introduce a discussion in terms of the effective coupling between reservoirs and sample region .",
    "the chosen model has this feature to the extreme . in the assumed model the electron only couples to the environment at the central site .",
    "we can therefore express the transition probability in a form that explicitly only involves the dynamics of the electron at the central site and the environment by simply noting , that in order to calculate the amplitude for a transition from the left to the right reservoir , the first propagation has to be from the left reservoir to the central site , and the last propagation from the central site to the right reservoir .",
    "the transition probability can therefore be rewritten as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is shorthand for the trace with respect to the environmental degrees of freedom , weighted with respect to the initial environment state , and @xmath35| 0\\rangle\\ ] ] is the retarded green s operator ( operator with respect to the environmental degrees of freedom ) for the central site dynamics as @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the particle vacuum state .",
    "the advanced green s operator is given by hermitian conjugation @xmath38^{\\dag},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes hermitian conjugation .",
    "in eq.([eq : transprob ] ) , the arbitrary initial time has been chosen at time zero , @xmath40 .    in many cases of interest",
    "we do not need the full information on the transition probability as function of time .",
    "for instance , if we are only interested in the average particle flow in a steady state we are only interested in the transition probability per unit time @xmath41 or the transmission coefficient for making a transition between a state of energy @xmath42 in the left reservoir and a state of energy @xmath43 in the right reservoir @xmath44 invoking the scattering approach for the description of transport properties for coherent quantum processes @xcite we have at zero temperature the contribution to the conductance at energy @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total transmission coefficient , the probability to reach the right reservoir for a state of energy @xmath45 in the left electrode .",
    "the factor of two is the spin degeneracy factor of the electron .",
    "we have in the previous section reduced the expression for the transition probability to an expression which only involves the dynamics at the central site . however , since both tunneling and interaction with the environment is present the dynamics is complicated and no closed expression for the transmission probability can be found , that is , without any further assumption no simplification is possible as the phonon average can not be done explicitly . if we , however , assume that the widths , @xmath48 , of the electronic energy bands of the electrodes are the largest energy in the problem , @xmath49 , it is possible to obtain closed expressions for the transition probability for various cases of environmental states . in this wide band limit",
    "an electron at the central site decays into a continuum of states in the electrodes , and we expect to have a quasi - stationary state which decays exponentially in time . to utilize this property of the electrodes we first discuss the lifetime for occupation of the central site in the absence of an environment .    in the absence of coupling to the environment",
    "the retarded green s operator for the central site , @xmath50 , reduces to the c - number green s function , equaling the amplitude @xmath51 for the particle to remain at the central site .",
    "the fourier transformed amplitude satisfies the dyson equation @xmath52 where the central site self - energy is given by @xmath53 and describes the coupling of the central site to the reservoirs , as indicated by the appearance of the electrode propagators .",
    "a lower capital is used to designate a subsystem green s function , implying that the electron is not allowed to propagate in or out of the electrodes , i.e. , its dynamics is determined by the hamiltonian with all connecting elements , @xmath54 , set equal to zero .    in the absence of tunneling between the electrodes and the central site we have for the isolated electrode green s functions @xmath55 and for the central site green s function @xmath56 in the presence of coupling between electrodes and the central site the dyson equation yields the central site green s function in terms of the self - energy @xmath57 the escape rate from the central site",
    "is given by the imaginary part of the self energy @xmath58 if the hopping matrix elements vary slowly with energy in the resonance region , @xmath59 , and the energy bands in the reservoirs are wide so that also the electrode density of states , @xmath60 , has a weak energy dependence , we can neglect the energy dependence of the escape rate , and by analyticity we have @xmath61 which implies that the real part of the self energy vanishes in the wide band limit .",
    "the wide band approximation simplifies the problem considerably as the time dependent green s function becomes a decaying exponential @xmath62 and the green s function satisfies , for times @xmath63 , the relation @xmath64 this group property leads to a tremendous simplification of the interacting problem as the tunneling dynamics at the central site and the environment dynamics decouple .",
    "if the group property , eq.([eq : group ] ) , is valid we have for the central site amplitude correlations @xmath65 where we have introduced the influence function describing the effect of the environment @xmath66 with the environment variable in the interaction picture @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 denotes the time and anti - time ordering operators , respectively .",
    "the decoupling of the particle and environment degrees of freedom is visualized using feynman diagrams in figure [ fig : decoupling ] .",
    "because of the group property , eq.([eq : group ] ) , the central site dynamics has a special behavior : the lifetime of the central site state is independent of the coupling to the environment , as the probability , @xmath70 , for the particle to remain at the central site after a time span @xmath71 , if initially at the central site , is @xmath72 and noting that @xmath73 is the interaction picture time evolution operator for the bath , and consequently unitary , we have @xmath74 .",
    "therefore by eq.([eq : siteprob ] ) we have for the staying probability @xmath75 which is independent of the coupling to the environment.@xcite    before we go on to calculate the influence function @xmath76 , which contains all information about the influence of the environment for various environmental states , we briefly discuss the transmission problem in the absence of coupling to the environment",
    ". we shall explicitly assume the exponential form eq.([eq : widebandgreensf ] ) for the decay amplitude .",
    "if we for the moment neglect the coupling to the environment we have for the transition probability @xmath77 the integrations are readily done and we obtain for the transition probability per unit time @xmath78 or equivalently for the transmission coefficient @xmath79 where we have introduced the central site spectral weight function @xmath80 and the left and right escape rates @xmath81 we observe that the transmission coefficient has the expected resonant character of the breit - wigner formula@xcite .    in the absence of coupling to the environment we therefore have the contribution to the conductance at energy @xmath45",
    "@xmath82    having discussed briefly the uncoupled case , we now turn to calculate the influence function z for various environmental states .",
    "we shall invoke the assumption of a wide band width allowing for the decoupling expressed by eq.([eq : siteprob ] ) , and obtain in this approximation the following expression for the transmission coefficient @xmath83 in the wide band limit we notice the integral of the transmission coefficient is related to the staying probaility at the central site @xmath84 and we can therefore conclude that the integral of @xmath85 is unaffected by the coupling to the environment since the staying probability , @xmath70 , is unaffected .",
    "in order to calculate the influence of the environment on the otherwise coherent quantum process , the task is to calculate the influence function given in eq.([eq : influence_def ] ) . the first step in achieving such a goal is to transform the operator expression into an analytical one . a general and convenient method for performing this transformation",
    "has been devised by schwinger @xcite .",
    "the key point to note for employing this method for the present purpose is to note that the influence function z quite generally can be expressed in terms of a closed time path generating functional provided the `` force '' is chosen properly as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the closed time path extending from @xmath88 to @xmath89 along @xmath90 and back again along @xmath91 , as illustrated in figure [ fig : path ] , and @xmath92 is the contour ordering symbol , ordering the environment operators @xmath93 according to their contour label position on the contour @xmath87 ( earliest to the right ) and @xmath94 is the function on the upper and lower branches of the contour specified by @xmath95 the closed time path generating functional @xmath96\\equiv    \\,\\langle t_c\\,e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_c { } \\ !      d\\tau\\,f(\\tau)\\,x(\\tau)}\\rangle\\ ] ] is therefore the quantity of interest .",
    "the influence of the environment only appears through the state of the environment in the generating functional , and different environments can now be handled on an equal footing corresponding to just substituting the proper environmental state , i.e. , the corresponding statistical operator .    in the present formulation",
    "we note that corresponding to the influence of an environment on a given physical quantity there corresponds a function , here denoted the proper `` force '' , which when inserted into the generating functional completely specifies the influence of the environment .    in the following section we calculate the generating functional and the influence function for various environmental states .",
    "in the preceding section we showed that in the presented model the influence functional refers only explicitly to the environmental degrees of freedom and is characterized by a single `` force '' .",
    "this simplifying feature will allow us to obtain closed expressions for the influence function for typical environmental states .",
    "we first discuss the quite common physical situation where the environment is acting as a heat bath .",
    "this could , for example , be the case in question where the hamiltonian is thought to represent a resonant tunneling structure , the lattice degrees of freedom of the crystal acting as the heat bath .",
    "a heat bath is characterized by a single macroscopic parameter , its temperature @xmath68 , and the environmental state is in this case described by the equilibrium statistical operator @xmath97 the average of the generating functional is then gaussian , yielding the quadratic form @xmath98=\\exp\\left\\ { -\\frac{i}{2\\hbar^{2}}\\int_c{}\\!d\\tau\\int_c { }    \\!d\\tau ' \\,f(\\tau ) d(\\tau,\\tau ' ) f(\\tau ' ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the contour ordered bath green s function .",
    "it is convenient for the physical interpretation to split the exponent appearing in the generating functional into real and imaginary parts @xcite @xmath100&=&\\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar^{2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\!\\!dt    \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\!\\ !",

    "we similarly have @xmath106 the fourier transforms of the retarded and the correlation propagator is connected according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath107    the calculation of the influence of the thermal reservoir on the transition probability has now been reduced to the performance of simple integrals which are readily done and we obtain for the influence function @xmath108 where the contribution from the retarded bath propagator is given by @xmath109 with @xmath110 specified by the function @xmath111 and the effective coupling constant given by @xmath112 the contribution from the correlation bath propagator is similarly given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 the two real functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the real and imaginary parts of the complex function @xmath117    since the environment is in thermal equilibrium the influence function @xmath118 in fact depends only on three independent variables @xmath119 the above choice being determined by the original time labeling of the green s functions .    in terms of the independent variables",

    "the reason we in the previous section made the distinction in the effects of the environment as expressed in the split @xmath215 where we distinguish between the retarded and correlation contributions , is that they represent two distinct influences of the environment .",
    "the term @xmath216 represents the systematic friction type and energy renormalization influence and @xmath217 the fluctuating part , including thermal as well as quantum fluctuations . for the thermal environment discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "the two types of influence were not independent , but related through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we now compare the thermal quantum environment with the classical stochastic environment introduced above .",
    "it follows directly in the presented real - time approach that the fluctuating level model is in one - to - one correspondence with the fluctuational aspect of the thermal case with the prescription for the correlation part @xmath218 and substitution of one for @xmath189 , @xmath219 .",
    "in addition , we see that the polaronic shift corresponds to the average displacement of the environment @xmath220 obtained from eq.([eq : tcoeff ] ) .    the transmission coefficient for the stochastic environment is obtained from @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the correlation part @xmath217 now depends on the explicit form of the correlator @xmath224 .",
    "for example , the high temperature form of the correlation function @xmath225 for a thermal ohmic environment , @xmath226 , corresponds to a delta - correlator @xmath227 the white noise case .",
    "the fluctuating level model thus only captures the correlation part @xmath217 of the thermal environment and neglects the systematic retarded part , except for its average influence .    for the fluctuating level model we therefore get for the influence function in the ohmic case @xmath228 and for the transmission coefficient @xmath229 comparing the result to the uncoupled case , we notice , besides the average energy shift and a reduction of the peak , @xcite that the resonance width @xmath173 of eq.([eq : breit - wigner ] ) is broadened according to @xmath230 we note that the transmission coefficient in this case is the same as the one obtained for the thermal case in the weak coupling and low temperature limit .      just as in the previous section we shall here consider the case where the environment can be described classically .",
    "in addition we shall assume , that in contrast to the previous section we know not only the probability distribution of the potential , but in fact the actual potential .",
    "in the following we shall therefore investigate the situation where we are able to couple the electron to an external field at the central site .",
    "in the present case of linear coupling it is sufficient to consider the case where the central site energy level changes harmonically in time .",
    "the external potential is therefore given by @xmath231 such a situation could for instance be realized in the case where the hamiltonian represents a small metallic grain with a single active level whose energy can be changed by an external electric potential , and the grain being coupled to large metallic electrodes .    in the case where the influence of the environment is represented by the external potential given by eq.([eq : externalfield ] ) we obtain for the influence function @xmath232 this corresponds to the fluctuating level model for the case where the potential @xmath93 is known with certainty to be given by the expression in eq.([eq : externalfield ] ) .    for the transition probability per unit time",
    "we then obtain the expression @xmath233 where we have introduced the function @xmath234    we now calculate the integral over @xmath235 in eq.([eq : exttransprob ] ) by expanding the exponential before performing the integration , and therefore assume that @xmath236 is non - zero .",
    "the case of zero @xmath236 corresponds to a constant external potential , @xmath237 , which only yields a trivial shift of the resonant energy .",
    "the transition probability per unit time can now be expressed as an integral involving the zeroth order bessel function , @xmath238.@xcite @xmath239 if we had assumed that the external potential was a sine function , @xmath240 , we would have obtained the same transmission coefficient for non - zero @xmath236 , but we would of course not have obtained a shift of the resonant energy in the case of @xmath241 .",
    "the total transmission coefficient is @xmath242 noting that @xmath243 , and using the summation formula for the bessel function @xmath238@xcite we obtain the total transmission coefficient@xcite @xmath244 the total transmission coefficient has lorentzian side bands at all harmonics of @xmath245 with a relative weight determined by the bessel functions , and maximal peaks in the spectrum at @xmath246 .",
    "the transmission coefficient is plotted for the parameters @xmath247 and @xmath248 in figure [ fig : external ] . for this parameter choice",
    "the first sideband is almost missing because @xmath249 is close to the first zero of the first order bessel function .      in the following",
    "we shall investigate the model for the environment in the coherent state .",
    "such a model may describe transport through a quantum dot coupled to an environment of coherent phonons.@xcite    the coherent state has the following representation in terms of the vacuum state , @xmath37 , of the environment @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the normalization factor .",
    "the state of the environment is then a pure state and the statistical operator for the environment reduces to the projection operator @xmath252    to calculate the influence of the environment in the case of a coherent state we therefore need to evaluate the following expression for the influence function @xmath253 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & n_{\\phi}^{-1 } \\langle 0| \\exp \\{\\phi^ * b_0 \\}\\nonumber \\\\    & & \\left(t_c    e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_c{}d\\tau\\,f^{0}(\\tau)\\,x(\\tau ) } \\right )    \\exp \\{\\phi b^{\\dag}_0 \\}| 0\\rangle .",

    "the coherent state case shares features with both the thermal and the external field cases .",
    "the coherent state influence function consists of a factor equal to the zero temperature einstein model influence function , which describes the systematic influence and quantum zero point fluctuations , and in addition a factor identical to the external field influence function .    for the total transmission coefficient we get",
    "@xmath268 performing a calculation similar to the one for the oscillatory level model we get a simple formula for the total transmission coefficient @xmath269 where @xmath270 in the limit @xmath271 , we of course recover the zero temperature einstein model result , eq.([eq : lineweight_t=0 ] ) . in the limit of @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and @xmath274 ) .",

    "here we simply implement it corresponding to propagation taking place through either arm .    the transmission probability given by eq.([eq : condprob ] ) then consists of the transmission probabilities for transmission through either arm and an interference contribution : @xmath288 where @xmath289 and the interference term is given by @xmath290 we now have an influence function for each of the two different environments , @xmath291 and @xmath292 , corresponding to the two different arms of the interferometer .",
    "for the transmission coefficient we now have according to eqs.([eq : tprobpertime],[eq : transfirst ] ) @xmath293 the calculation of the total transmission coefficient , specified in eq.([eq : tot_trans_coeff ] ) , in various limits is similar to what has been calculated in section [ sec : environments ] .",
    "for example , in the absence of an environment we get for the total transmission coefficient @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the relative phase difference due to the external flux , and @xmath296 and @xmath297 are the total transmission coefficients for the individual arms , and specified in the previous sections .",
    "the decay rates , whose energy dependence can be neglected in the wide band limit , are defined as @xmath298 and @xmath299 to illustrate the special features of the suppression of phase coherence in the present model , we discuss the cases of thermal bath , fluctuating level , classical field , and coherent state environment below .      the transmission coefficient through either arm we obtained previously .",
    "for the interference term , we have the expression @xmath300 where the influence function corresponding to site @xmath5 enters as @xmath301 and the central site energies for each arm are shifted downwards according to @xmath302 with the negative polaronic energy shift @xmath303 being site dependent through the spectral function @xmath304 in the course of the derivation we have noted that @xmath305 which follows from eq.([eq : hermconj ] ) .",
    "the interference contribution to the transmission coefficient is seen to have the form @xmath306 we notice , that the interference term vanishes unless the energy of the particle is conserved .",
    "any energy exchange with the thermal environment thus destroys the interference . in the present model interference",
    "is thus hypersensitive to the presence of the thermal environment , and in a dramatic fashion displays the equivalence of dissipation and loss of phase coherence",
    ".    we can also calculate the transmission coefficient for the case of fluctuating levels .",
    "we assume that each site , @xmath307 and @xmath308 , is coupled to separate classical fluctuating environments , represented by the variables @xmath309 , @xmath310 , respectively .",
    "analogously to the previous thermal bath case there are contributions to the transmission coefficient from transmission through either arm , and there is an interference contribution specified by eq.([eq : int_trans_coeff ] ) , except for the thermal influence function being replaced by @xmath311 where @xmath312 as in the thermal case , the interference contribution to the transmission coefficient is completely suppressed by dissipation .      in the case where the energy levels change harmonically in time with the same frequency @xmath313 but with different coupling strength , we obtain for the interference term @xmath314 where we have introduced the function @xmath315 upon performing the integral over @xmath235 we obtain @xmath316 change in energy of the particle due to interaction with the external field",
    "does not destroy the interference in accordance with the notion that such a non - dissipative process does not lead to suppression of phase coherence when time reversal symmetry is unbroken .",
    "carrying out a similar calculation for the coherent state case , we find a similar qualitative behavior for the interference term .",
    "exchange of one quantum does not change the coherent state and interference is not destroyed .",
    "we have developed a functional method to study the influence of various environments on quantum tunneling , and shown that the effect of the environment on the transmission probability , specified by the influence function , is described by the value of a certain generating functional .",
    "the state of the environment only occurs explicitly in the expression for the influence function through the appearance of its statistical operator , thereby allowing a unified discussion of the influence of environments on phase coherence and thereby on the transmission properties .",
    "an advantage of the approach is that different environments are treated on an equal footing , thereby simplifying comparison of similarities and differences .",
    "we have calculated the influence function for various environments and parameter regimes using the developed non - equilibrium generating functional technique . in order to obtain analytical results",
    "we have concentrated on simple resonant tunneling , and invoked the wide band approximation . in the thermal case we obtained analytical results for the broad resonance limit , the strong coupling limit , the high temperature limit and the weak coupling and low temperature limit .",
    "the short time approximation used in the broad resonance , strong coupling and high temperature limits , and the long time approximation invoked in the weak coupling and low temperature limit were numerically demonstrated to be good approximations . for the thermal case we discussed the closed expression obtainable for the einstein model .",
    "we studied the effect of a classical fluctuating environment on the tunneling process , the fluctuating level model .",
    "the environment is here described by a gaussian distributed stochastic variable .",
    "the fluctuating level model was shown to only capture the correlation part of the influence of the thermal environment , as the fluctuating level model neglects the systematic part except for its average influence .",
    "we find in this case that the total transmission coefficient is a lorentzian with its width temperature broadened .",
    "we studied the effect of a harmonically varying external field , and found the heights and widths of the lorentzian sidebands at all the harmonics of the classical force .    for the coherent state case",
    "we also obtain a closed expression for the influence function , and we showed that the coherent state case is an intermediate situation sharing features of both the zero temperature einstein case and the external field case .",
    "finally we studied the suppression of quantum interference by considering a simple model of two resonant levels situated on the two arms of a ring connected to two external reservoirs .",
    "the quantum interference was monitored by having the ring enclosing a magnetic flux . when calculating the transmission probability we obtained contributions corresponding to tunneling through either arm and an interference contribution .",
    "we found that the interference term vanishes in the thermal bath and fluctuating level cases even for the slightest energy exchange between system and environment .",
    "the model thus represents a case where dissipation completely destroys quantum interference . in the case of a non - dissipative environment , e.g. , a classical force",
    ", there is no loss of phase coherence , and there is therefore always an interference contribution , even if energy is not conserved in the transition .    in conclusion",
