    "in paper  i of this series ( hambly et al .",
    "2001a ) we describe the supercosmos sky survey ( hereafter sss ) .",
    "this ambitious project ultimately aims to digitise the entire sky atlas schmidt plate collections in three colours ( bri ) , one colour ( r ) at two epochs .",
    "paper  ii in this series ( hambly , irwin & macgillivray  2001b ) describes the image detection , parameterisation , classification and photometric calibration techniques for the survey . in this , the third paper of the series , we describe in detail the calibration of the astrometric parameters contained within the survey data .",
    "paper  i is intended as a user guide to the sss while papers  ii and  iii provide more technical details concerning the derivation and calibration of the object parameters .",
    "the first release of data consisted of @xmath7 square degrees of the southern sky at high galactic latitude ( @xmath8 ) , and is known as the south galactic cap survey . although these three papers make explicit reference to sgc data , all details are generally applicable to sss data at galactic latitudes @xmath9 . at low galactic latitudes , particularly towards the galactic centre , crowding degrades astrometric and photometric performance .",
    "the photographic plate material used for the sss survey consist of sky  limited schmidt photographic glass plate and film originals , or glass copies of glass originals , taken with the uk , eso and palomar oschin schmidt telescopes  for more details see paper  i , morgan et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and references therein .",
    "leaving aside such details as object detection and parameterisation ( see paper  ii ) the solution to the problem of assigning celestial co - ordinates to each object requires comparison with a reference catalogue and the application of a plate model .",
    "schmidt plate astrometry has a long history ( see section  [ astsol ] for some references ) involving reference catalogues of increasing density and precision along with increasingly sophisticated plate models  for a concise review , see morrison , smart & taff  ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors question the need for a conventional plate model at all and advocate a novel technique making use of an ` infinitely overlapping circles filter ' .",
    "however , we note that they concede that , for large  scale survey work at least , a global linear plate model plus non  linear correction via an empirical plate ` mask ' is appropriate .",
    "it is just such a method that we describe in section  [ astsol ] . in section  [ results ] , we proceed to test the astrometric solutions against ccd drift scan data encompassing plate boundaries  ie .  a test of the true external errors , both random and systematic , as a function of magnitude and plate position .",
    "section  [ results ] also discusses our results in comparison to extragalactic objects defining the international celestial reference frame ( ma et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "in addition to providing celestial co - ordinates , the sss survey catalogues include proper motions . in the southern hemisphere , all objects paired between the serc ",
    "j / ej ( first epoch , hereafter b@xmath10 ) and serc  er / aao  r ( second epoch , hereafter r ) plates have a proper motion measurement ( see section  [ pmchoice ] ) .",
    "the methodology for determining the proper motions closely follows that described in evans & irwin  ( 1995 ; hereafter ei95 ) and is detailed in section  [ pms ] .",
    "small changes made necessary by the plate material used are also described .",
    "section  [ results ] contains a comparison between our derived proper motion measurements against an external dataset , and we analyse in some detail the relative contribution of random and systematic errors on these proper motions as a function of magnitude .",
    "as we will describe in section  [ astsol ] the celestial co - ordinates are tied to the hipparcos reference frame via the tycho2 catalogue . as stated in the introduction to the hipparcos and tycho catalogues ( esa  1997 )",
    "this frame is practically identical to the international celestial reference system , and we demonstrate the level of any residual zeropoint errors with respect to the icrf in section  [ results ] . furthermore , our proper motion zeropoint is taken from extragalactic objects , and is therefore also tied to an inertial reference frame .",
    "the advantages of such a proper motion reference frame are discussed extensively with reference to the lick observatory northern proper motion programme ( npm  klemola , jones & hanson  1987 ) and are clearly demonstrated by recent results from the corresponding southern hemisphere survey , the yale observatory / san juan southern proper motion program ( spm  platais et al .",
    "1998 ; mndez et al .",
    "all photographic material for the sss survey is measured on supercosmos , a fast high precision microdensitometer .",
    "aspects of the system enabling highly accurate positional measurements are described in hambly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and will not be repeated here , except to state that it was demonstrated that the machine has the capability to centroid isolated , well  exposed stellar images on modern fine  grained emulsions at a precision of @xmath11 m ( or 33mas at the plate scale of the sky survey schmidt plates ) .      converting the positions of stars and other objects measured on a photographic plate into celestial coordinates",
    "is a classical problem in photographic astronomy and various techniques are available to solve it .",
    "all the techniques are based on having a grid of reference stars , with known celestial coordinates , distributed over the plate .",
    "a transformation is then defined between the measured @xmath12 positions and the celestial coordinates of the reference stars .",
    "it is the details of calculating the transformation which may vary between different techniques .",
    "the supercosmos global astrometric software ( hereafter xytoradec ) uses an algorithm based on the starlink program astrom ( wallace  1998 ) .",
    "the code implementing the algorithm is partly borrowed from astrom and partly consists of calls to routines in slalib ( wallace  1999 ) , the starlink positional astronomy library . astrom ( and hence xytoradec ) use a modified version of the standard , traditional technique for converting plate positions to coordinates . in this technique the catalogue coordinates of the reference stars are converted to tangent plane coordinates , adjusted for geometrical distortion ( caused by the telescope optics and mechanical deformation of the plates during exposure ) and a linear six - coefficient least squares fit is made between the adjusted standard coordinates and the measured positions .",
    "several authors have described this technique , eg .",
    "knig  ( 1962 ) , taff  ( 1981 ) and green  ( 1985 ) . in this method a simple , single , global fit is made for all the reference stars imaged on the plate .",
    "the technique used by astrom and xytoradec differs from the traditional method in that the plate centre is allowed to vary ( that is , included in the fit ) .",
    "an outline of the method is as follows :    first , the point on the celestial sphere at which the telescope was pointing when the plate was exposed is established .",
    "reference star coordinates are converted to apparent ( that is , observed ) coordinates in the desired system .",
    "standard ( tangent plane ) coordinates , @xmath13 , are computed for the reference stars about the tangent point .",
    "the standard coordinates are then adjusted for the geometrical distortion where each image centroid is adjusted radially .",
    "the adjustment consists of separately multiplying each @xmath14 and @xmath15 by the factor @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( see murray  1983 page 196 ) .    after applying the geometric distortion",
    "a small systematic distortion remains between the adjusted standard coordinates and positions measured on schmidt plates .",
    "these residuals are the well - known ` swirling patterns ' seen in the residuals of linear fits made to schmidt data ( eg . taff et al .",
    "a set of corrections at a grid of points over the plate are prepared beforehand .",
    "a grid size of 1  cm on the plate ( @xmath5  arcmin ) was chosen since this provides sufficient resolution to accurately map out the @xmath18  arcmin  scale non  linear distortion expected .",
    "different grids are used for plates originating from different schmidt telescopes and in different wavebands .",
    "these grids are prepared by averaging the residuals over numerous plates , using this fitting procedure ( but of course without these corrections ) .",
    "figure  [ swirls ] shows four examples of the distortion patterns from the three schmidt telescopes providing data for sky surveys .",
    "for the uk schmidt j  survey , the data are averaged over 200 plates containing 193866 individual standard star residuals .",
    "the eso schmidt data are from 142 plates/107346 stars while for the palomar schmidt first epoch  e and second epoch r  surveys the data are from 51 plates/47101 stars and 9 plates/20814 stars respectively . in all cases ,",
    "the reference catalogue used was the tycho2 ( hg et al .",
    "the largest non  linear effects are seen for the palomar poss ",
    "i  e plates .",
    "this has been seen previously , and is probably a result of the design of the original plate holders used for that survey ( eg .",
    "irwin  1994 ) . note that the redesign of these plate holders has resulted in much smaller non ",
    "linearities for the second epoch survey ",
    "compare figures  [ swirls](c ) and  ( d ) .",
    "for each reference star or programme object the appropriate correction is derived by interpolating the grid at the position of the star or object .",
    "simple bilinear interpolation is used ( eg . press et al .",
    "the corrections are then simply added to the standard coordinates .",
    "( 150,110 )    the standard coordinates , adjusted for mechanical and optical distortion , are then fit to the measured positions . for",
    "a complete description of xytoradec see davenhall  ( 2000 ) .",
    "section  [ results ] illustrates typical results from the above procedure .      the sgc survey data originally made publicly available on the world wide web made use of the act reference catalogue ( urban et al .",
    "1998 ) . since mid2000",
    ", the tycho2 catalogue has been available ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) , and all sgc astrometry was re - reduced with respect to this catalogue .",
    "sss data are now routinely reduced with respect to the tycho2 reference catalogue .",
    "this compilation of 2.5 million stars reaches magnitudes v  @xmath19 ( 90% complete to v  @xmath20 ) , and has positions at mean observational epoch of @xmath1  j1991.5 from the tycho catalogue , but includes proper motions via a combination of reprocessed tycho data and first epoch positions from the astrographic catalogue and 143 other ground  based catalogues ( see references in hg et al . ) .",
    "the astrometric standard stars provided by tycho2 are heavily saturated on sky  limited schmidt plates , and as we show in section  [ results ] there is a demonstrable magnitude systematic between bright and faint stars at the level of up to @xmath21  arcsec at field edges .",
    "future projects , both ground  based ( for example , the ucac project ",
    "see zacharias et al .",
    "2000 ) and space  based , will provide higher density catalogues reaching fainter magnitudes and will bridge the magnitude range ( @xmath22 ) required to eliminate such systematic errors from the plate solutions ( e.g.  irwin et al  1998 ) . in this way ,",
    "the full  blown _ internal _ precision obtainable from centroiding on schmidt plates will ultimately limit the external accuracy of the astrometry .",
    "we note here that the sss survey database is organised in such a way as to make rereduction of the plate astrometry easy to achieve , and when higher density catalogues become available this will indeed be done .",
    "the availability of global astrometric plate solutions for the survey data enables any extracted fits image ( see paper  i ) to contain fits world co - ordinate system ( wcs ) header information .",
    "as yet , there is no formally accepted standard method and keyword set for implementing the wcs .",
    "however , greisen & calabretta  ( 1999 ) have proposed a standard , and we have followed this in our database access software .",
    "the wcs is defined locally for each extracted image by fitting a linear plate model between tangent plane projected celestial co - ordinates and @xmath12 in pixel units .",
    "scale , non  linear distortions are not relevant to small scales of tens of arcminutes .",
    "we simply specify the wcs using the ` ra --- tan ` and ` dec -- tan ` prescription along with the ` cd ` rotation matrix elements ( see greisen & calabretta  1999 for more details ) .",
    "this set is compatible with , for example , the starlink software collection ( eg .  image display utilities such as gaia / skycat , draper  1999 ) .",
    "note also that previously defined keywords sets are also written to the fits headers for backwards compatibility .      at the time of writing",
    ", it seems likely that the aao ",
    "r survey will be completed on kodak 4415 ` tech  pan ' film .",
    "for example , a small number ( @xmath23 ) of sgc fields have film originals measured for the database .",
    "due to its finer emulsion granularity , this medium is superior to iiiaf in all aspects of astronomical performance ( eg .",
    "parker & malin  1999 ; parker et al .",
    "2001 ) with the exception of large scale astrometric stability .",
    "the ` swirl ' patterns seen for glass plates ( eg .  figure  [ swirls ] ) do not repeat from film to film , but systematics at similar scales and of a similar amplitude are nonetheless present .",
    "such fields have individual systematic correction via the corresponding j  plate data .",
    "the procedure is simply to map out all plate  to  plate errors as a function of position between the r  film and its corresponding serc ",
    "j / ej  plate in a given field using the j  plate to define the ` swirl ' correction mask .",
    "the plates available for the sss provide several potential plate pair combinations for the determination of proper motions . any ( or all ) of these combinations could be used for this task .",
    "for the purposes of producing a uniform proper motion survey in the southern hemisphere to the highest possible accuracy , we chose the j / r combination for several reasons .",
    "each field has ( or soon will have ) a good quality original photograph on fine  grained emulsion reaching j  @xmath24 , r  @xmath25 .",
    "i ` e ' and eso  r material available are glass copies , are between 0.5  and 1.0  magnitudes less deep , and neither survey covers the entire southern hemisphere ; the poss ",
    "i plates have the additional complication of not being on the same system of field centres as the eso / serc atlas .",
    "i survey lacks depth , reaching i  @xmath26 . moreover , the r  survey was envisaged as a second epoch survey to the j , and efforts have been made to ensure a good time baseline between first and second epoch ( morgan et al .",
    "1992 ; e.g.  see figure  6 later ) . as we show in section  [ dcrcorr ] , we can accurately model any colour effects introduced in the astrometry as a result of our choice of j / r plates .",
    "of course , future enhancements to the sss may include sophisticated analysis of the multiple epoch data available from more than two plates per field if there is sufficient user demand ( e.g.  paper  i ) .",
    "figure  [ pairing ] shows the number of pairings made between the  j and  r plates for several different galactic latitudes .",
    "these curves show the same general trends . below a pairing criterion of 1  arcsec ,",
    "a dramatic fall in the number of pairings occurs due to global positional errors ( see section  [ results ] ) . for a pairing criterion of more than 6  arcsec",
    ", a sudden and steady rise is seen in the number of pairings at the level of many thousands at each step .",
    "these must be spurious , since we do not expect @xmath27 high proper motion stars per schmidt field .",
    "in fact , the _ total _ number of stars having @xmath28 arcsec  yr@xmath2 is of order @xmath29 over the entire sky ( luyten  1979 ) .",
    "a cummulative histogram of the fraction of high proper motion stars ( ie .",
    "those having @xmath28 arcsec  yr@xmath2 ) made from the nltt catalogue ( figure  [ highmu ] ) shows that 90% of those catalogued have motions @xmath30 arcsec  yr@xmath2 .",
    "for a median epoch difference of 15  yr ( see figure  [ ephist ] ) , 0.4 arcsec  yr@xmath2 corresponds to a shift of 6  arcsec .",
    "hence , in order to pair 90% of ` high ' proper motion stars , but at the same time avoid large numbers of spurious pairings , the pairing criterion has been set at 6  arcsec .",
    "however , the database access software ( see paper  i ) allows the user the default option of limiting pairings to those within 3  arcsec for most applications when completeness of high proper motion objects is not an issue .",
    "this is to further minimise the number of spurious pairings for applications that would be sensitive to such contamination  clearly , in figure  [ pairing ] even between pairing criteria of  3 and 6  arcsec there is a rise in pairings over and above that expected from high proper motion objects alone .",
    "as far as pairing motionless objects is concerned , a pairing criterion of 3  arcsec is very generous in the light of absolute errors in position of @xmath31  arcsec ( section  [ results ] ) .",
    "( 80,50 )    ( 80,50 )      the determination of accurate proper motions requires that systematic positional errors as a function of plate position be removed from the displacements of all objects measured between the first and second epoch plates ( eg .",
    "such errors arise from emulsion shifts on the photographs themselves , and also from systematic positional errors during the measurement process .",
    "note that in hambly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we described a procedure for minimising systematic measurement errors arising from the @xmath12 table of supercosmos ; nonetheless we follow ei95 exactly and compute one  dimensional error functions ( ie .  errors in @xmath32  and",
    "@xmath33 as a function of @xmath32  and  @xmath33 ) when mapping the plate  to  plate systematic errors since small residuals are expected to be present at the few tenths of a micron level ( for example , errors resulting from pixel placement within the linear ccd used to scan the plate ) .",
    "other systematic errors possibly present in the proper motions include those due to positional errors as a function of magnitude .",
    "for example , it is likely that the centroids of heavily saturated images off  axis on the photographs are displaced relative to those of fainter stars owing to off ",
    "centre haloes of scattered light , an effect compounded by the limited dynamic range of the measuring machine .",
    "note however that such effects can not be simply measured from the data and removed since we expect populations of objects having different mean apparent magnitudes to show systematic differences in mean proper motion due to galactic structure ( eg .",
    "brighter stars will show systemic motions with respect to fainter stars since they are , on average , nearer to the sun ) .",
    "we argue that such effects will be minimised by using the photographic material specified in the previous section since the first and second epoch plates were obtained on the same field centres with the same telescope using the same guide stars at similar times of the year and at similar ( optimum ) airmass .",
    "other effects due to misalignment of the scanning beam with the plate along with different ` depths ' of image within the emulsion are likely to be present  eg .  ei95 . in their work",
    "such effects were eliminated by measuring each plate twice , at orientations within the machine of @xmath34 and  @xmath35 .",
    "taking the mean position between the two scans , these errors were removed .",
    "the scale of the sss makes scanning each plate twice impractical and so systematic errors resulting from such effects will remain in these data .",
    "the zeropoint of the proper motion system is fixed using objects classed as galaxies ( paper  ii describes the image classification procedure ) . as described in ei95 , once the plate  to ",
    "plate error mapper has removed systematic errors between the first and second epoch plates , in general the mean stellar displacement will be zero ( since stellar images dominate the number counts ) while that of galaxies will be non  zero . simply applying a global translation to make the galaxy images have zero mean displacement fixes the proper motion zeropoint to the extragalactic frame .",
    "note that the image classifier is reliable at the level of @xmath36% down to b@xmath37 ( paper  ii , table  9 ) and so only galaxies brighter than that magnitude are used in this procedure .",
    "figure  [ galzero ] shows an example of the distribution in galaxy displacement as a function of magnitude for the sgp field  411 , demonstrating the effectiveness of this procedure .",
    "( 150,90 )    as an independent and external check on the extragalactic zeropoint , we also examined the displacements of all isolated , good quality images paired between the sgc survey database and the veron ",

    "figure  [ qso ] shows this comparison ( @xmath38  qsos over the entire sgc region ) .",
    "( 150,90 )    table  [ qsonum ] details the mean displacements and rms errors for the qso sample",
    ". clearly , there are no significant non  zero residuals . moreover",
    ", this test illustrates the likely level of errors in the stellar proper motions .",
    "figure  [ ephist ] shows a histogram of the epoch differences between the  j and  r survey photographs within the sgc survey . for a median epoch difference of 15  yr",
    ", the final column in table  [ qsonum ] gives the implied mean proper motion precision and rms zero point error , in either co - ordinate , as a function of magnitude .",
    "obviously , some fields have much shorter time baselines than the median value and the proper motions in such fields will be correspondingly less accurate ( see section  [ pmerrs ] ) .",

    "again , these errors must not be measured from the data since populations of different mean colour ( eg .  redder young disk stars having relatively high metallicity and bluer old halo stars having relatively low metallicity ) are _ expected _ to have different systemic motions due to their different ensemble kinematics .",
    "we modelled dcr effects following exactly the prescription given in ei95 with the necessary changes made for the different emulsion / filter combinations used here , with relevant data being taken from evans  ( 1989 ) and references therein . in figure  [ dcr ] we show our computations of the coefficient of refraction @xmath63 as a function of synthetic ( b@xmath10r ) colour for the  b@xmath10 and  r passbands along with the polynomial fits and linear extrapolations used .",
    "( 80,120 )    the dcr corrections are applied as detailed in equations  1 and  2 , section  5 of ei95 .",
    "the corrections take the form of small changes to the second epoch positions as a function of colour and as a function of mean galaxy colour ( since the galaxies define the zeropoint described above ) .",
    "note that in computing the refraction coefficient we assumed nominal atmospheric temperature , pressure , humidity and unit airmass .",
    "calculation shows that this is good enough for our purposes  for example , recomputing @xmath63  for airmass  @xmath64 in the range @xmath65 in steps of  0.1 shows negligible zeropoint changes in @xmath63 as a function of colour while the gradient remains constant .",
    "in order that some estimate of probable errors in proper motion are available when using sss data , error values in units of mas  yr@xmath2 are provided with each proper motion .",
    "these errors are estimated on a field  by  field basis , and therefore take into account the small differences in survey plate quality as well as the varying time baselines .",
    "the estimates also take into account the effects of centroiding precision as a function of magnitude , individually for stars and galaxies .",
    "the measurements are made from the global average dispersions in centroids , as a function of magnitude , once the error mapping described in section  [ errmap ] has been completed .",
    "of course , the assumption in making these estimates is that the intrinsic proper motion is small compared to the errors and makes negligible contribution to the overall dispersion .",
    "this is obviously true for galaxies and faint stars , but is an increasingly poor assumption for increasingly brighter stars .",
    "the errors are thus overestimated for bright stars .",
    "figure  [ tychores ] shows histograms of the mean rms error per star per sgc plate in right ascension and declination for the different survey plate collections included in the sss survey .",
    "these plots demonstrate the ability of the plate solutions to predict the positions of the reference catalogue stars _ on the plates_. it is encouraging that even for the 51  poss  i e  glass copies  which are not of the highest quality compared to modern atlas copies , and which have a mean epoch of  1954 ( minkowski & abell  1963 )  the global plate solutions are accurate at the 0.3  arcsec level .",

    "i survey gives the best results , with some mean residuals down at @xmath68  mas .",
    "this result is probably due to a combination of minimal proper motion errors ( the mean observational epoch of the serc ",
    "i survey is close to that of hipparcos / tycho ) and also the fact that the i  plates are the least sensitive of the surveys , resulting in less saturation and lower intensity scattered light haloes for the reference catalogue standards .      in a recent paper , deutsch  ( 1999 ) compared positions of a sample of extragalactic radio sources with those derived from several currently available wide  field digitised photographic survey databases .",
    "the comparison sample came from the very long baseline interferometric study of ma et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , including 212  sources _ defining _ the icrf . as in deutsch  ( 1999 )",
    ", we included all defining , candidate and ` other ' sources from ma et al .",

    "clearly , there are systematic discrepancies in sgc survey astrometry on scales of a degree or so and at the level of up to @xmath21  arcsec that are not apparent from the residuals of the individual field astrometric fits .",

    "however , brighter magnitude ranges in table  [ qsonum ] fail to indicate true zeropoint errors .",
    "this underestimate is due to the fact that the data cover the whole sgc survey region , and systematic zeropoints of different magnitude and sign manifest themselves as an increased random error . on the other hand , because the sgc  spm comparison is done in a restricted declination range near the sgp , there is a clearer tendency for systematic zeropoints of the same magnitude and sign .",
    "the global random errors for sgc proper motions are therefore dominated by magnitude dependent systematics for v  @xmath6 , and table  [ spmtab ] indicates this by measuring the apparent sgc ",

    "application of a global correction to the proper motions to remove these zeropoint errors is clearly not possible since their magnitude and sign changes over the sgc region .",
    "once again , centroiding errors will increase with magnitude as one approaches the plate limits such that at j , r  @xmath167 the proper motion errors will be @xmath168  mas  yr@xmath2 , but with zeropoint error with respect to the extragalactic frame of @xmath3  mas  yr@xmath2 .",
