    "weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is perhaps the most promising candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "any realistic supersymmetric model at the weak scale contains explicit but soft susy breaking terms which are presumed to originate from some high energy dynamics .",
    "if one writes down the most general form of soft terms , it would require too many parameters , e.g. more than 100 even for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "furthermore , for a generic form of soft terms , the superparticle masses should exceed about 10 tev in order to avoid dangerous flavor changing processes @xcite .",
    "such large superpartner masses spoil the natural emergence of the weak scale , and thus the major motivation for supersymmetry also .    in view of these difficulties of generic soft terms",
    ", it is quite demanding to have a theory of soft terms leading to a predictive form of flavor conserving soft terms .",
    "in fact , the shape of observable soft terms is mainly determined by the mediation mechanism of susy breaking , i.e. by the couplings of the susy breaking messenger fields to the observable fields , rather than by the susy breaking dynamics itself .",
    "this is a good news since in many cases",
    "the couplings of the messenger fields can be treated in perturbation theory , while the susy breaking dynamics involves nonperturbative effects . therefore once the messegers of susy breaking are identified , one can get a well - defined prediction for soft parameters . as long as the predicted soft parameters conserve the flavors ,",
    "their size can be of order the weak scale .",
    "this would allow the prediction to be tested by the future collider experiments and/or the low energy precision experiments .",
    "there already exist many interesting proposals for flavor conserving soft parameters , e.g. dilaton / modulus mediation in heterotic string/@xmath1 theory @xcite , gauge mediation @xcite , no - scale @xcite or gaugino mediation @xcite , anomaly mediation @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "very recently , the bnl experiment e821 has reported a measurement of the muon s anomalous magnetic moment , indicating a @xmath9 deviation of @xmath10 from the standard model value @xcite : [ deviation ] a_a_^exp - a_^sm= ( 4216)10 ^ -10 .",
    "although can be consistent with the standard model value if one takes other theoretical calculations of the hadronic vacuum polarization @xcite , this may indeed be a sign of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "in particular , this deviation can easily find its explanation in supersymmetric models through the well - known neutralino - smuon and chargino - sneutrino diagrams @xcite .",
    "an explicit formula of the susy contribution to @xmath0 is presented for instance in ref .",
    "the susy contribution to @xmath0 is enhanced as @xmath11 increases , and the chargino - sneutrino diagram provides a dominant contribution for generic susy parameters . in the limit of degenerate superparticle masses ,",
    "the leading contribution is approximately given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the superparticle mass in the loop .",
    "it has been pointed out already that this new data on @xmath0 provides useful information on susy parameters @xcite , e.g. upper bounds on some superparticle masses .",
    "it is also noted that much of the parameter space of the minimal anomaly - mediated model can be excluded by the new data when combined with the constraints from @xmath14 @xcite",
    ". possible origin of @xmath15 other than susy is discussed also in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to study the implications of the precisely measured @xmath0 for various mediation models of susy breaking which lead to predictive forms of flavor conserving soft parameters .",
    "the models studied here include the dilaton / modulus - mediated model in heterotic string/@xmath1 theory , no - scale or gaugino - mediated model , gauge - mediated model , and also the minimal and deflected anomaly - mediated models @xcite .",
    "in the subsequent analysis , we explore the possibility that the deviation ( [ deviation ] ) is due to the susy contribution to @xmath0 in these models . throughout the analysis",
    ", we will assume that soft parameters ( approximately ) conserve cp , which may be necessary to avoid a too large neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "if one takes ( [ deviation ] ) as it is , the corresponding @xmath4 bound on @xmath2 would be given by [ range ] 1010 ^ -10 < a^susy _",
    "< 7410 ^ -10 .",
    "the inclusive @xmath16 process is known to put strong constraints on the mssm parameter space .",
    "the leading susy contribution to @xmath16 comes from the charged higgs boson and chargino mediated diagrams .",
    "the charged higgs boson diagram contributes constructively , while the chargino diagram interferes with the sm amplitude constructively or destructively depending upon the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath16 is obtained by normalizing the hadronic uncertainty with the semileptonic decay rate @xcite : = ( |d|^2 + a ) f , where @xmath18 is the phase space factor of the semileptonic decay with @xmath19 , @xmath20/\\kappa(z)$ ] for the qcd correction factor @xmath21/3\\pi$ ] for the semileptonic decay , and the term @xmath22 describes the bremsstrahlung corrections and virtual corrections satisfying the cancellation of the ir divergence @xcite . the amplitude @xmath23 is determined by the wilson coefficients at @xmath24 which can be obtained by the matching condition at the weak scale and the subsequent rg evolution .",
    "we perform the matching at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for the sm contribution , while taking the leading order ( lo ) matching for the mssm contributions , i.e. the charged higgs and the chargino contributions .",
    "we then perform the rg evolution down to @xmath24 at the nlo to find d = c^(0)_7 ( m_b ) + ( c^(1)_7 ( m_b ) + _",

    "@xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) stand for the @xmath41 gaugino masses , @xmath42 are the soft scalar masses of the scalar components @xmath43 of the mssm superfields @xmath36 , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the trilinear and bilinear coefficients in the scalar potential . to follow up the most frequently used convention for the relative sign of @xmath39 and @xmath44 , we use different sign conventions of @xmath39 for different models : @xmath46 for the dilaton / modulus and no - scale ( gaugino ) mediation models , @xmath47 for the gauge and anomaly mediation models .    each mediation mechanism that will be studied in this paper",
    "provides a well - defined prediction for @xmath39 , @xmath44 and @xmath42 at certain high energy messenger scale .",
    "the predicted high energy parameters can be transformed to the low energy values through the standard renormalization group ( rg ) analysis . in this procedure , we assume the minimal particle content in the observable sector , viz . the mssm particles .",
    "if there exist more particles with masses between the messenger scale and the weak scale and also with sizable gauge or yukawa couplings to the mssm fields , our results would be changed accordingly .",
    "we also ignore the effects of small yukawa couplings of the 1st and 2nd generations in the rg evolution .",
    "the situation for @xmath17 and @xmath45 is more involved since they depend on the details of how the @xmath17-term is generated as well as on how susy breaking is mediated . in the absence of any definite prediction for @xmath17 and @xmath45 , normally one trade @xmath17 and @xmath45 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 through the condition of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , while leaving @xmath50 undetermined .",
    "note that @xmath17 and @xmath45 do not affect the rg running of other soft parameters , which can be assured by the dimensional argument and selection rules .",
    "it has been noted that an extensive region of the soft parameter space gives rise to a scalar potential with a color or charge breaking minimum or a field direction along which the potential is unbounded from below @xcite .",
    "for instance , it turns out that the entire parameter space of the dilaton / modulus mediation in heterotic string theory and also of the no - scale mediation give such a potentially dangerous scalar potential @xcite . in this paper , we do _ not _ require that the scalar potential should have a phenomenologically viable _ global _ minimum , so the model is allowed as long as the scalar potential has a _ local _ minimum with correct low energy phenomenology .",
    "we also do not take into account the cosmological mass density of the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) in the mssm sector .",
    "there are many different scenarios in which the lsp mass density computed in the framework of @xmath51 parity conserving mssm becomes irrelevant , e.g. a late time inflation triggered by an mssm singlet , @xmath51-parity violation , or a modulino / gravitino lighter than the lsp .",
    "in this section , we examine the low energy phenomenology of various mediation mechanisms yielding flavor conserving soft parameters .",
    "the main purpose is to see which value of @xmath2 can be obtained without any conflict to @xmath14 and the collider bounds on superparticle masses . the models studied here include the dilaton / modulus - mediated model in heterotic string/@xmath1 theory , no - scale or gaugino - mediated model , gauge - mediated model , and finally the minimal and deflected anomaly - mediated models . for each mediation model ,",
    "the parameter regions allowed by laboratory tests and also the corresponding value of @xmath2 are summarized in figs .",

    "the so - called deflected anomaly mediation is a kind of hybrid between anomaly mediation and gauge mediation , but still all susy breaking effects originate from @xmath129 .",
    "the model contains a light singlet @xmath108 which describes a flat direction in supersymmetric limit as well as @xmath104 flavors of gauge - charged messengers @xmath105 which are coupled to @xmath108 in the superpotential w=_i x_i^c_i .",

    ". then the deflected anomaly mediation is described by six input parameters , m_aux , m , , , n , ( ) .    for numerical analysis , we take @xmath137 which corresponds to the case that @xmath108 is stabilized by the coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite . the results for @xmath138",
    "are depicted in fig .",
    ". possible value of @xmath2 in this model is severely constrained by the chargino , stau , and lightest higgs mass bounds as well as by @xmath5 , however there is still a small parameter region which provides right value of @xmath139 .",
    "the recent bnl measurement of the muon s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath140 may indeed be a sign of new physics . in this paper",
    ", we examined the possibility that the deviation @xmath15 from the sm value is due to the susy contribution in the framework of various mediation models of susy breaking which give rise to predictive flavor conserving soft parameters at high energy scale .",

    "no - scale model is similarly ( but less ) constrained by @xmath5 .",
    "gauge mediation models with low messenger scale can give any @xmath2 within the @xmath4 bound ( [ range ] ) .",
    "however when the messenger scale is very high , the allowed value of @xmath2 is constrained by @xmath5 as in no - scale or dilaton / modulus mediation models .",
    "the possible value of @xmath27 in minimal anomaly mediation is constrained to be smaller than the central value ( @xmath8 ) by the upper bound on @xmath28 . deflected anomaly mediation is severely constrained by the superparticle mass bounds and also by @xmath5 , however there is still a small parameter region which gives right value of @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis uses the lo matching condition for the susy contributions to @xmath5 .",
    "it is expected that more involved analysis including the nlo susy effects @xcite makes the constraint from the lower bound on @xmath141 weaker , while making the constraint from the upper bound stronger .",
