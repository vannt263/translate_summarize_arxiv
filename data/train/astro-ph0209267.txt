    "ngc 5728 is a well known prototype of embedded bars .",
    "it is classified as ( r1)sab(r)a , and a seyfert 2 ( distance 33 mpc ",
    "1=180 pc ) .",
    "its nuclear bar is oriented at 45 degrees of the main bar ( shaw et al 1993 ) , and could rotate faster .    petitpas & wilson ( 2002 ) have obtained a co map of ngc 5728 with the ovro interferometer .",
    "they found a total co mass of 3.1 10@xmath3 m@xmath2 .",
    "however , they underestimate the extended component , filtered out by the interferometer , and miss a significant part of the co emission , due to restricted velocity coverage .",
    "we report here co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) observations with the iram-30 m telescope , with 23 and 12 \" beams .",
    "the molecular gas distribution does not follow the nuclear bar in the center , but is strongly asymmetric .",
    "it follows the ionization cone , with the geometry found by wilson et al ( 1993 ) . at larger scale",
    ", there is a tendency for the co intensity to follow the primary bar , along its characteristic dust lanes ( cf fig .",
    "the total h@xmath0 mass ( without including the he ) is 3.1 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 with a conversion factor of 3 10@xmath4 cm-2/(k.km / s ) . it is larger than the hi mass of 2.5 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 . at the tips of the bar ,",
    "strong co(1 - 0 ) emission is found , associated with star formation , due to orbit crowding ( in particular on the receding side , at 35 \" @xmath5 7kpc ) .",
    "the total molecular gas mass is about 10 % of the stellar disc mass .",
    "the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) intensity ratio is in general quite low ( between 0.5 and 1 ) .",
    "one interesting feature is the presence of two strips of higher co ratio parallel to the radio jet direction .",
    "it could indicate an enhancement of the co excitation along the wall of the ionization cone ."
