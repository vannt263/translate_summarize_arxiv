    "highly mismatched semiconductor alloys such as gan@xmath4as@xmath6 and gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 have attracted considerable interest in recent years , both from a fundamental perspective and also because of their potential device applications @xcite . when a small fraction of as is replaced by nitrogen ( n ) in gaas , the band gap ( @xmath7 ) initially decreases rapidly , by @xmath8 mev when 1% of as is replaced by n @xcite .",
    "similar behavior has been experimentally observed in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , where @xmath7 decreases initially by @xmath9 mev per % of bismuth ( bi ) replacing as @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent experiments @xcite have also revealed the presence of a large bowing of the spin - orbit - splitting ( so ) energy ( @xmath10 ) , which increases strongly with increasing bi composition .    it was shown recently using photo - modulated reflectance ( pr ) spectroscopy that increasing the bi composition in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 leads to the onset of an @xmath7@xmath11 @xmath10 regime in the alloy @xcite .",
    "this regime is of interest for the design of highly efficient and thermally stable optoelectronic devices since it opens up the possibility of suppression of the dominant non - radiative auger recombination pathway , the presence of which dominates the threshold current and degrades temperature stability of iii - v lasers operating at telecommunication wavelengths @xcite .",
    "investigation of dilute bismide and bismide - nitride alloys of gaas is therefore highly promising for potential device applications .",
    "the extreme band gap bowing observed in ( in)gan@xmath4as@xmath6 has been well explained in terms of a band - anticrossing ( bac ) interaction between two levels , one at energy @xmath12 associated with the extended conduction band edge ( cbe ) states of the host ( in)gaas matrix , and the second at energy @xmath13 associated with the highly localised n - related resonant impurity states in the alloy . in this simple model ,",
    "the cbe energy of the n - containing alloy is given by the lower eigenvalue , @xmath14 , of the 2-band hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the n composition dependent matrix element describing the interaction between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , usually taken to vary with n composition , @xmath17 , as @xmath18 .",
    "bismuth , being the heaviest stable group v element , is significantly larger and more electropositive than as . it should therefore be expected that any bi - related impurity levels should either lie below or close in energy to the valence band edge ( vbe ) and that , if an anticrossing interaction occurs , it will occur between the bi - related impurity levels and the vbe of the host gaas matrix .",
    "recently the presence of such an interaction has been proposed @xcite , but there has been controversy as to whether or not a bac - like model can be applied in the case of the dilute bismides . this controversy is due in part to the absence in pr spectra of bi - related features in the gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 valence band which , from previous studies of gan@xmath4as@xmath6 , one would expect to be present in the case of a bac interaction .",
    "in addition , analysis of the band structure of small ga@xmath19bi@xmath20as@xmath21 supercells using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations failed to find evidence of bi - related resonant states immediately below the valence band maximum @xcite .    in ref .",
    "we presented a nearest - neighbor @xmath0 tight - binding ( tb ) model to describe the electronic structure of dilute bismide alloys of gaas and gap .",
    "the @xmath0 model agrees well both with experimental measurements and pseudopotential calculations@xcite of the variation of @xmath7 and @xmath10 with bi composition in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 over the investigated composition range .",
    "calculations based on our tb model reproduce the experimentally observed transition to an @xmath7 @xmath11 @xmath10 regime in both free - standing and strained alloys for @xmath22% @xcite and @xmath23% @xcite respectively .",
    "these calculations also agreed with the previously published conclusions of the pseudopotential calculations of ref .  , namely that bi forms a resonant state below the gaas vbe and that the alloy vbe is derived predominantly from the host vbe as opposed to a bi bound state .",
    "detailed analysis of our tb calculations support the presence of a bac interaction between the gaas vbe and lower - lying bi - related impurity states which are resonant with the gaas valence band .",
    "we show , in agreement with our previous work , that the energy of the bi resonant state in ga@xmath24bi@xmath25as@xmath21 ordered supercell calculations shifts down significantly in energy for small values of @xmath26 , thereby accounting for the failure to observe such a state in previous small supercell calculations@xcite .",
    "in addition , our analysis indicates that the failure to observe any bi - related features below the gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 vbe in pr spectra results from the broadening of the bi impurity states by the large density of host valence states with which they are resonant @xcite .",
    "the realisation recently of the first electrically pumped dilute bismide quantum well laser @xcite indicates the progress which has been made in the material growth and understanding of this highly - mismatched material system . from a theoretical standpoint , this milestone mandates the development of models suited to the description of the optoelectronic characteristics of dilute bismide - based quantum well lasers .",
    "while our atomistic tb model has revealed in detail the effects of bi on the electronic structure of gaas , this comes at significant computational cost .",
    "atomistic theoretical models have been applied with success to analyse quantum dot heterostructures , but due to the additional degrees of freedom present in a quantum well ( where the brillouin zone is two - dimensional , as opposed to the zero - dimensional quantum dot case ) continuum models of the band structure are favoured for the description of the optoelectronic properties .",
    "the reason for this is that the additional degrees of freedom , specifically , the carrier wave vectors , must be integrated out in order to calculate key physical quantities such as the material gain , which is computationally expensive even in the continuum case .",
    "the validity of the continuum approach to calculating quantum well band structure has been thoroughly verified with @xmath3-based many - body calculations @xcite having been employed to accurately describe the gain characteristics of , amongst others , gainp @xcite , ingan @xcite and dilute nitride gainnas @xcite quantum well lasers .",
    "these factors strongly motivate the development of simple and accurate models of the gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 band structure , which can then be applied to the study of the electronic and optical properties of dilute bismide materials and devices .    in this work",
    ", we apply the tb model to derive a @xmath3 hamiltonian suitable to describe the band dispersion of gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 . based",
    "on ordered supercell calculations using the tb model , we derive a 12-band @xmath3 model for gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 which includes bac interactions between the gaas vbe and bi impurity states which are resonant with the gaas valence band .",
    "the model is shown to be in excellent agreement with full tb calculations on ordered and large , disordered supercells , as well as with experimental measurements of the band gap and spin - orbit - splitting across the full composition range considered ( @xmath27 0  12% ) and , combined with a detailed tb - based analysis , demonstrates emphatically the applicability of the bac model to gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 .",
    "the dilute bismide - nitride alloy gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 has also been identified as being very promising for the design of highly efficient optoelectronic devices , since it opens up several avenues by which the band structure can be engineered @xcite . in particular",
    ", gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 is predicted to have a giant band gap bowing , allowing for emission at 1.3 and 1.55 @xmath28 m on a gaas substrate , as well as retaining the large spin - orbit - splitting bowing that is characteristic of gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , thereby offering the possibility of suppressing the non - radiative chsh auger recombination process at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "also , incorporation of bi and n in gaas introduces compressive and tensile strain respectively when grown on a gaas substrate , so that a high degree of strain engineering should be possible in gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 when grown on gaas , providing further opportunities for the manipulation of the electronic properties @xcite .    based on our tb model for gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5",
    "we show that the effects of bi and n on the electronic structure of gaas are largely independent of one another , both in ordered and disordered crystals @xcite .",
    "we can therefore derive a 14-band @xmath3 model for gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 which accurately describes the near zone centre band dispersion of ordered gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 crystals .",
    "finally we conclude our discussion of the gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 band structure by presenting calculations of @xmath7 and @xmath10 as a function of bi ( @xmath29% ) and n ( @xmath30% ) composition .",
    "our calculations show that a large wavelength range is accessible under low strain on a gaas substrate and highlight the wide parameter space where the chsh auger - suppressing band structure condition @xmath7 @xmath11 @xmath10 is fulfilled .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : bac_evidence ] we demonstrate the presence of a bac interaction in the valence band of gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 by using the tb model to construct and explore the character of the resonant state associated with an isolated bi impurity in a series of ordered ga@xmath19bi@xmath20as@xmath21 supercells . in section  [ sec:12band ]",
    "we derive a 12-band @xmath3 hamiltonian for gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 from the tb calculations and compare the resulting model to the results of full tb calculations for ordered and disordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 supercells .",
    "we present in section  [ sec:14_band_model ] a 14-band @xmath3 model for gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 .",
    "we first compare the results of the model to full tb supercell calculations , and then discuss some of the possibilities for band structure engineering offered by this novel quaternary alloy .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarise and conclude .",
    "we showed in ref .   that the spectrum of fractional @xmath31 character , @xmath32 , for the states in a supercell is a useful tool for analyzing the evolution of the electronic structure of dilute bismide alloys , where @xmath32 for a given state refers to the fraction of the state which can be projected onto the host matrix material band edge ( @xmath31-point ) states . by calculating this spectrum , @xmath33 , for a range of",
    "ordered gabi@xmath1p@xmath2 supercells , we showed that an isolated , substitutional bi atom acts as an impurity in gap , giving rise to a highly - localised four - fold degenerate impurity level lying approximately 0.1 ev above the gap vbe , in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 is calculated in general by projecting a specific choice of host matrix ( in this case , gaas ) band edge states at @xmath31 onto the full spectrum of levels in the alloy supercell .",
    "using the subscripts @xmath34 and @xmath35 to denote the unperturbed host and bi - containing alloy supercell states respectively , we obtain @xmath36 by projecting the unperturbed ga@xmath19as@xmath19 states at @xmath31 , @xmath37 , onto the spectrum of a ga@xmath19bi@xmath38as@xmath39 alloy supercell , @xmath40 :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the degeneracy of the host band having energy @xmath43 at @xmath31 ( so that @xmath44 and 2 for the conduction , highest valence and so bands , respectively ) and we choose @xmath45 so that @xmath46 has a value of unity for a doubly degenerate host matrix @xmath31 state at energy @xmath47 .    by considering the distribution of @xmath33 for the gap vbe ( i.e. light - hole ( lh ) + heavy - hole ( hh ) band edges ) , in a series of ordered , cubic ga@xmath19bi@xmath20p@xmath21 supercells we showed that this impurity level interacts with the gap vbe via an anticrossing interaction which we found to vary with bi composition as @xmath48 .    a similar bac interaction can be demonstrated in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , as we describe here by considering the @xmath33 spectra of the gaas vbe and the impurity state associated with a substitutional bi atom in a series of ordered , cubic ga@xmath19bi@xmath20as@xmath21 supercells containing @xmath49 atoms , for @xmath50 .",
    "we proceed by inserting a single substitutional bi impurity in a series of cubic @xmath51-atom ga@xmath19as@xmath19 supercells and calculate the @xmath33 spectrum in each case by projecting the wave functions of the four - fold degenerate ga@xmath19as@xmath19 vbe onto the full spectrum of the bi - containing alloy @xcite",
    ".    we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fgc_vbm_ordered_gabias ] that the gaas vbe character in each supercell resides predominantly ( @xmath52% ) on the alloy vb maximum , with the remainder distributed over a series of lower - lying valence levels .",

    "the gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 vbe is an admixture of the gaas vbe and the impurity state associated with a bi impurity .",

    "we determine that the state which mixes with each of the gaas vbe states is a localised , four - fold degenerate bi resonant impurity state similar in character to that found in gabi@xmath1p@xmath2@xcite .",

    "[ fig : ga32bi1as31_band_structure ] , several points regarding the validity and interpretation of the 12-band model should be noted . in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated using a green s function approach that the n - related impurity band in the bulk bac hamiltonian for gan@xmath4as@xmath6 should not be considered to represent a specific impurity band in the actual material band dispersion .",
    "rather , it represents a weighted average of all impurity - related states interacting with the band edge of the host matrix , reflecting the distribution of states , observed for instance in @xmath33 and @xmath62 in figs .",
    "[ fig : fgc_vbm_ordered_gabias ] and  [ fig : fgc_bi_ordered_gabias ] . in the dilute nitride case",
    "the validity of the bac model then followed from its ability to describe to a high degree of accuracy the modified dispersion of the lowest conduction band @xcite .",
    "similar behavior can be expected for gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 ; as the host density of states increases ( due to the folding of bands to @xmath31 as the size of the supercell is increased ) the state associated with an isolated bi atom becomes delocalised , with its associated character spreading over several supercell levels , which can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fgc_vbm_ordered_gabias ] and  [ fig : fgc_bi_ordered_gabias ] .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : ga256bi1as255_band_structure ] , which compares the band structure of an ordered , cubic 512-atom ga@xmath104bi@xmath20as@xmath105 supercell calculated using the @xmath0 tb and 12-band @xmath3 hamiltonians .",
    "we see that the 12-band model provides an accurate description of the band edge energies and dispersions of the lowest - conduction , lh , hh and so bands .",
    "however , in this calculation , the increased density of zone centre host valence states compared to the 64-atom case results in a broadening of the @xmath31 character associated with the lower bac related bands , so that their associated @xmath31 character is spread over several ga@xmath104bi@xmath20as@xmath105 valence levels , with lower valence states starting to accumulate more bi character than in the smaller supercell calculations ( cf .",
    "[ fig : fgc_bi_ordered_gabias ] ) .",
    "this accounts for the small difference between the @xmath3 and tb @xmath31 energies near @xmath111 ev in the 512-atom calculation , where the @xmath3 state is a weighted average of several states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fgc_vbm_ordered_gabias ] , and therefore lies just below the tb state energy .    in summary , the bac model provides a valid and accurate description of the modified valence band structure of ordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 crystals , but with the caveat that the lower - lying bi impurity bands are not necessarily associated with specific material bands ",
    "rather , they describe the net effect of the bi - related impurity states that interact with the host matrix vbe .    in the next section",
    "it will be demonstrated that this interpretation remains valid in the case of a disordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloy , where the quality of the agreement between the tb calculated band dispersion and that calculated using the 12-band model decreases somewhat due to a loss of both short and long - range order in the crystal .",
    "nevertheless , the validity of the bac model is further supported by showing that the variation of @xmath7 and @xmath10 with bi composition obtained from the 12-band model is in excellent agreement with full tb calculations and experimental measurements across the investigated composition range .",
    "the inclusion of multiple bismuth atoms to form a disordered ga@xmath24bi@xmath112as@xmath39 supercell ( containing @xmath65 substitutional bismuth atoms ) can introduce bi pairs ( where a single gallium atom has two bismuth nearest - neighbours ) and higher order clusters .",
    "such disorder lowers the symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of the associated resonant states , @xmath113 . as we move towards a disordered alloy the gaas vbe interacts with a distribution of impurity states related to isolated bi atoms and bi pairs and clusters , similar to those observed for n atoms in gan@xmath4as@xmath6@xcite and gan@xmath4p@xmath6@xcite . as predicted by the bac model",
    "the alloy vbe shifts upward in energy and experiences an overall reduction in gaas @xmath31 character with increasing bi composition .    as the bi composition increases in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 the resulting disorder and formation of bi pairs and clusters gives rise , in addition to the resonant states associated with isolated bi atoms , to further impurity states which predominantly lie close in energy to the unperturbed gaas vbe .",
    "these states then experience strong broadening due to the large density of gaas valence states with which they are resonant , the result of which is a distribution of the gaas vbe @xmath31 character related to bi pair and cluster states over a large number of alloy valence states , due to the strong hybridisation between these states and those of the gaas vbe @xcite .    in order to demonstrate that the 12-band @xmath3 model presented in section  [ sec : derivation ] is applicable to the realistic case of a disordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloy we use it here to investigate disordered supercells , for which one might expect the bac model to break down .",
    "we firstly calculate @xmath7 and @xmath10 in a series of large ( 4096-atom ) gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 supercells in which bi atoms are distributed in a statistically random way , leading to the formation of an increasing number of bi pair and cluster states with increasing bi composition @xmath87 .",

    "furthermore , we showed in refs .   and   that the tb model we have developed for gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 is in very good agreement with a range of experimental measurements of @xmath7 and @xmath10 in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , across the full composition range for which experimental data exists in the literature . in order to compare the 12-band model directly to experiment",

    "the effects of biaxial strain were included in the 12-band calculations by using vgard s law to interpolate between the gaas and gabi lattice and elastic constants in order to evaluate the components of the strain tensor and associated energy shifts to the band edges as a function of the bi composition @xmath87 .",

    "[ fig : eg_so_expt_vs_kdotp ] that the 12-band model is in good agreement with both the tb calculations and experiment across the investigated composition range , and that the 12-band model reproduces the important crossover to @xmath7 @xmath11 @xmath10 in the correct bi composition range .",
    "we therefore conclude that the 12-band model presented here provides a realistic and accurate description of the main features of the gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 band structure .    some limitations of the model as applied to disordered alloys should however be noted . in a disordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloy ,",
    "the loss of long and short range order associated with the formation of bi pairs and higher order clusters introduces localised distortions of the crystal lattice as well as giving rise to localised states lying close in energy to the gaas vbe .",
    "both of these effects perturb the band structure significantly , the first by reduction of symmetry , and the second by strong perturbation of the host valence band structure due to hybridisation with localised states .",
    "while we have shown that the 12-band model including valence band - anticrossing provides an accurate description of the band edge energies at the @xmath31-point , we might expect that the quality of the description of the band dispersion away from @xmath31 should degrade somewhat compared to the ordered case of section  [ sec : ordered ]  this indeed turns out to be the case .",

    "as expected , the band edge energies at @xmath31 are well described by the 12-band model but the quality of the description of the band dispersion reduces more rapidly with increasing wave vector than in the ordered case of the previous subsection .",
    "nevertheless , the 12-band model produces , even in the presence of significant alloy disorder , a satisfactory description of the band structure in the vicinity of the conduction and valence band edges at the @xmath31-point , which are the regions of interest for the calculation of the optoelectronic properties relevant to laser operation .    having shown that the 12-band model introduced in section  [ sec : derivation ] is well - suited to describe the band structure of dilute bismide alloys close to the band edges and over a large composition range",
    ", we now turn our attention to dilute bismide - nitride alloys .",
    "we focus on the quaternary alloy gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 and outline the extension of the 12-band model to a 14-band model which accounts explicitly for the effects of bismuth and nitrogen on the gaas band structure .",
    "in order to derive a 14-band hamiltonian for gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 from the tb model we first examine the effects of bi and n when both are doped into gaas in dilute quantities .",
    "we examine a series of ordered , cubic ga@xmath19bi@xmath20n@xmath20as@xmath117 supercells ( in which it is ensured that the n - bi seperation is as large as possible ) using an @xmath0 tb model for gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 @xcite .    to determine whether or not the effects of bi and n on the gaas electronic structure are independent of one another we construct the impurity wave functions associated with substitutional bi and n atoms in these supercells and calculate their interaction by evaluating the matrix element of the full tb hamiltonian for the bi and n containing supercell between them : @xmath118 .",
    "this gives @xmath119 @xmath28ev for all supercells considered , showing that the effects of isolated n and bi atoms on the electronic structure are decoupled in the ordered case and hence that the electronic structure of ordered gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 crystals admits a simple interpretation in terms of separate n- and bi - related bac interactions in the conduction and valence bands , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in ref .  , we show that the variations in the band edge energies of gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 alloys can be described by combining the variations of the band edge energies in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and gan@xmath4as@xmath6 , even for large disordered supercells .",
    "this again emphasizes that bi and n largely act independently of each other in gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 and therefore their interactions with the host gaas matrix can be well described by independent bac interactions in the valence and conduction bands .",
    "guided by this insight , we modify the 12-band hamiltonian of eq .   to account for the presence of n , by including two n - related states in the hamiltonian , which have an anticrossing interaction with the conduction band @xcite . when parameterising the resulting 14-band hamiltonian for a given gabi@xmath1n@xmath4as@xmath5 supercell we treat the effects of bi and n on the gaas electronic structure as independent of one another .",
