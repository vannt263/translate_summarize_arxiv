    "in our recent works we have reported about the optical properties of cesium halide thin films , namely , cesium chloride ( cscl ) , cesium bromide ( csbr ) and cesium iodide ( csi ) .",
    "the optical properties stood out due to the singular appearance of surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) peaks in the visible region . while we confirmed that spr peaks arise due to formation of cesium metal clusters , two basic questions arise from these observations , _ `` what mechanisms lead to the formation of cesium metal nano - clusters especially the observed nano - rods ? '' _ and _ `` why does csi behave differently from cscl and csbr ? '' _ the direct experimental investigation into the formation of metal nano - clusters is not possible , however , we may logically speculate the sequence of events that led to the formation of metal nano - clusters .",
    "thin films of cesium halide were fabricated by thermal evaporation in vacuums better than @xmath0  torr .",
    "the films were deposited on microscopy glass slides maintained at room temperature .",
    "all the films were fabricated in identical conditions .",
    "looking at fig  1 , an immediate observation is the striking similarity between morphology of cscl , csbr ( not shown here ) and csi polycrystalline thin films .",
    "large grains are tiled and tighly packed with sharp grain boundries .",
    "the grains however do not have regular shapes .",
    "these sem micrographs were taken within few hours of sample fabrication .",
    "the morphologies gradually change with time as neighbouring grains receed to become smaller and spherical in appearance ( fig  2 ) .",
    "[ tiles ]        [ fig2 ]      nature has a natural tendency to force grains to take up a spherical shape .",
    "this is nature s way of minimizing the free energy of the system ( g )  @xcite .",
    "the equation used to model this behavior of nature is given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the surface energy per unit area and grain boundary energy per unit area respectively . @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the grain s surface area and grain boundary area respectively .",
    "grain boundary area is the area of contact between two grains . for a spherical grain of a given volume ,",
    "the system s free energy is the least due to a large decrease in grain boundary area , @xmath5 at the cost of a relatively small increase in surface area ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "[ triplejun ]    the grain shaping or its change to spherical shape is due to grain boundary grooving .",
    "`` grooving'',@xcite as the name suggests , is the phenomenon by which gaps appear between the grains of polycrystalline samples .",
    "the fissures develop from the film surface towards the substrate .",
    "theoretical models show the grooving occurs due to atoms moving along the surface away from the `` triple intersection point '' by surface diffusion  @xcite ( fig  3 ) .",
    "fig  1 , clearly shows due to the near hexagonal tiling of the grains , triple intersection points are formed even within the film .",
    "fig  4 shows pictorial representation of fig  1 ( initial situation is shown in inset ) followed by how these triple intersection points evolve , pushing into the grain and thus giving a sphereical shape .",
    "[ t1 ]    in the above paragraph , we have assumed @xmath3 to be a constant .",
    "this is far from the truth since the grain boundary energy depends on the lattice defects caused by the mismatch between the lattice at the grain boundary and its bulk  @xcite .",
    "this mismatch manifests as a shell region whose thickness is proportional to the grain size .",
    "smaller grains have thinner shells with less lattice mismatch and hence smaller @xmath3 .",
    "thus nature breaks the grains into smaller spherical grains with time , thus reducing the system s free energy by lowering @xmath3.@xcite fig  5 highlights the formation of shell around the grain via volume diffusion of defect towards the surface .",
    "we shall be discussing volume diffusion further , however at this point it is important to appreciate that if there is a lattice mismatch between the shell and core then @xmath3 takes values to assists grooving of the grains .",
    "0.5 cm    .table for lattice mismatch in core - shell structure [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     k. arima et .",
    "@xcite have observed that this reaction preceeds slowly for atomospheric relative humidity ( rh ) less than 30% and increases with rh . also , there is a near exponential increase in the rate of reaction for rh above 80% .",
    "k. arima et .",
    "@xcite works would explain difference in ageing observed by us in the samples maintained in the dessicator and those left in open . also , antonelli et .",
    "@xcite have shown that vacancy generation increases under the high hydrostatic pressure ( compressive ) .",
    "hence , metal cs formation is encouraged in dessicator with slower @xmath6 reaction rate .",
    "while this reaction involves only cesium , we do observe a difference in ageing rate depending on which halide is in bonding with cesium .",
    "this is due to fact that ageing depends on ( i ) what rate cesium clusters are formed at the surface ( volume diffusion which is inversely dependent on halide mass ) and ( ii ) thicker shell leading to faster grooving ( surface diffusion due to lattice mismatch ) .",
    "comparing the ageing rate of 600  nm thin films of cscl , csbr and csi , we found the rate of ageing in the following order , @xmath7 and no ageing in csi .",
    "the fastest ageing was seen in cscl since color centers moved towards the surface faster with volume diffusion rate being inversely proportional to the halide atom s mass . with lattice mismatch being low",
    ", grooving was slower and formation of nano - rods retarded .",
    "while in the case of csi , formation of cesium shell would be slower , but grooving faster .",
    "the thinner cesium shells would not enable formation of large nanorods , giving impression of no ageing in csi .",
    "to summerize , thermal evaporated films of the three halides result in polycrystalline films with large grains and sharp grain boundaries .",
    "the grain boundaries become sites of grooving with mass of material being pulled away from the grain boundary to give spherical grains . along with this , vacancies in the form of color centers in the cesium halide lattices move towards the grain surface . the rate at which this volume diffusion occurs depends on halide atom s mass ( its faster in cscl than csbr or csi ) . at the surface , these color centers accumulate , forming metal clusters and giving rise to a core - shell structure . depending on the type of lattice mismatch in the core - shell structure two alternative paths of sequencing occurs .",
    "while the screw dislocation leads to necking , the mismatch in lattice size leads to an accelerated grooving .",
    "grooving is faster in csi than cscl and csbr . accelerated grooving leads to smaller grains .",
    "smaller grains encourage reaction with water vapor , thus reducing the shell size . making it difficult to sustain the necking .",
    "the necks break off faster . ageing observed in our samples",
    "is essentially due to the nanorods of cesium and in decreasing aspect ratio .",
    "the decreasing aspect ratio , with time and inturn successive grain division would be due to the smaller grain size .",
    "smaller grain size would inturn imply thinner shells and lesser amount of cesium .",
    "this in turn would not allow for growth of longer nanorods .",
    "since csi have a large mismatch in their core - shell lattices , grooving is faster and shell is thinner compared to cscl and csbr .",
    "hence the nano - rods formed are of smaller length .",
    "this makes it difficult to obtain spr peaks shifting throughout the full visible range with ageing in csi .",
