    "exclusive electron scattering from the deuteron target is very interesting by itself , and also as a very relevant stepping stone towards understanding exclusive electron scattering from heavier nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction at gev energies allows us - and requires us - to carefully study the reaction mechanism .",
    "it is necessary to consider final state interactions ( fsis ) between the two nucleons in the final state , two - body currents , and isobar contributions . of these",
    ", the fsis can be expected to be the most relevant part of the reaction mechanisms at the gev energy and momentum transfers relevant to the study of the transition from hadronic to quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "for some recent reviews on this exciting topic , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "even though the deuteron is the simplest nucleus , and it has been the subject of considerable attention for a long time , there are several open questions : is it possible to experimentally determine the high - momentum components of the deuteron wave function even though the nuclear wave function or the momentum distribution are not observables ? will conventional nuclear physics break down or become too cumbersome at some point , and will a description involving quarks become necessary ? are there any six - quark admixtures in the deuteron wave function , and do they have an unambiguous experimental signal ?",
    "what influence does short range physics have on conventional wave functions , and how can this influence be removed to find an effective potential @xmath1 , provided one is interested in low energy scenarios only @xcite ?",
    "relativistic wave functions are available @xcite for the deuteron . and",
    "while the calculational effort is still considerable , it can be managed without resorting to super computers .",
    "the interest and importance of the @xmath0 process is reflected in the fact that recently , a deuteron benchmarking project has been started to investigate the differences between various calculations that are based on non - relativistic wave functions @xcite .",
    "anything that we learn about the reaction mechanism of the @xmath0 reaction has implications for heavier targets or experiments where the deuteron is used as a lab .",
    "some examples for the latter are the measurement of the neutron magnetic form factor by measuring a ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections .",
    "this allows for a significant reduction in the model dependence of the extracted form factor , but some theoretical input is still required @xcite . another example for using the nucleus as a lab is color transparency .",
    "while meson production from nuclei @xcite is the main thrust of color transparency investigations , color transparency in @xmath4 reactions is very interesting and topical , too @xcite . in order to study color transparency ,",
    "one first needs to establish a firm understanding of all the conventional nuclear effects .",
    "several experiments on deuteron targets have been performed in the last few years , both at jefferson lab and at mit bates , and these data have either been published recently or are currently under analysis @xcite .",
    "there are also new proposals for d(e , ep ) experiments at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "apart from these exciting new data , there are very interesting open questions posed by the data that have been available for some years now @xcite .",
    "regardless of the momentum transfers involved , there has been a discrepancy between data and calculations at low missing momentum .",
    "we discuss calculations in kinematics relevant to the new experiments as well as the low missing momentum puzzle in our results section .    the experimental activity in @xmath4 reactions on the deuteron and other light nuclei has been matched by theoretical efforts .",
    "these calculations typically are performed using glauber theory , the generalized eikonal approximation @xcite , or a diagrammatic approach @xcite , although there are rare exceptions @xcite .",
    "even a second - order correction to the eikonal approximation has been suggested recently @xcite .",
    "many of these calculations focus on the differential cross section only , and use just the central part of the nn scattering amplitude .",
    "currently , almost all calculations for @xmath0 reactions are unfactorized @xcite , but factorized approaches are used for heavier targets @xcite . a common feature first introduced in glauber calculations",
    "is the assumption that the momentum transfer in the rescattering of the two nucleons is purely transverse .",
    "this has consequences both for the profile function , and the argument for which the nn scattering amplitude is evaluated .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new calculation with several important features : we use a fully relativistic formalism , and describe the ground state with a solution of the gross equation@xcite ; we include all parts of the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude , including all the spin dependent parts , and use a realistic , modern parametrization ; the only approximation that we make is to neglect the negative energy states , as discussed at the end of the first section .",
    "this new calculation can be used at all energy and momentum transfers , provided that an appropriate full set of @xmath5 scattering data is available .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , we review the theoretical framework for our calculations , then , we show numerical results for the cross section and asymmetries .",
