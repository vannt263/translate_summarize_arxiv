    "<S> the lagrangian of the model @xmath0 depends on the gauge couplings @xmath1 , which sets the strength of @xmath2 gauge interactions , ( matrix ) yukawa couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the up(down)-type quarks and leptons coupled to the higgs doublet @xmath5 , and the parameters of the tree - level higgs potential @xmath6 for @xmath7 the potential has degenerate minima , which are characterized by non - zero higgs field vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath8 . as usual it is a signal of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . due to the degeneracy </S>",
    "<S> one can choose the vacuum , for which only @xmath9 component has non - zero vev @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be expressed in terms of the lagrangian parameters ( in the leading order ) as a space - time independent solution of the classical equation of motion @xmath11 due to interactions with the higgs - field condensate @xmath12 , elementary particles acquire masses proportional to the corresponding coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it is this fact that allows one , given the sm relation @xmath13 , to deduce the value of the self - coupling @xmath14 from the higgs mass @xmath15 gev , measured at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained value turns out to be rather special . before the discovery of the higgs boson both theorist and experimentalist were eagerly searching for hints of new physics ( np ) </S>",
    "<S> one way to address this issue is to analyze self - consistency of the sm by studying high - energy behavior of the relevant effective couplings . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : higgs_mass_constraints ] quite an old plot @xcite with two curves is presented in the plane @xmath16 , the upper ( red ) line corresponds to the `` triviality '' constraint - at the corresponding scale @xmath17 the self - coupling hits a landau pole / becomes non - perturbative . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the observed value of the higgs mass lies significantly below this line in the whole range of @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> r0.5     the second ( green ) curve represents a lower bound on the mass originating from the fact that the higgs potential with scale - dependent @xmath14 becomes unstable for a given scale @xmath17 , leading to possible decay of the sm vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the curve looks more interesting since @xmath18 lies in a dangerous vicinity of the line . to decide whether the sm can be extrapolated self - consistently up to the planck scale or new physics </S>",
    "<S> should be introduced to cope with the above - mentioned instability one has to perform an elaborated analysis taking into account various radiative corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> a proper way to study symmetry breaking in the sm is to consider effective potential @xmath19 , which also takes into account contribution @xmath20 from vacuum fluctuations of all fields of the model @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are introduced . for @xmath20 loop expansion </S>",

    "<S> can clearly see the origin of instability @xcite  the fermionic contribution drives the potential to negative values . </S>",
    "<S> high - order terms in the expansion can be found from vacuum graphs involving @xmath34 in propagators .    before going further , </S>",
    "<S> let us mention an annoying subtlety of gauge - dependence of the effective potential @xcite at general values of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it manifests itself as a dependence on auxiliary gauge - fixing parameters @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is controlled by the following nielsen identity @xcite : @xmath36 which tells us that the change due to @xmath37 variation in @xmath38 can be compensated by appropriate field rescaling . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that only at extrema , the external source @xmath39 vanishes at extrema . ] </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energy - density is gauge - invariant . </S>",
    "<S> we should keep this in mind , when discussing the stability issue of the sm .    in order to address the problem of the sm stability , </S>",
    "<S> we consider how the values of @xmath38 at _ extrema _ are related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> denoting higgs field value at possible additional minimum as @xmath40 , we distinguish the case of absolute stability of the ew vacuum , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath42 we have _ critical _ situation with degenerate minima @xmath43 finally , for @xmath44 our ground state turns out to be unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case deserves further study , since there exist a possibility for our universe to have negligible probability to decay into the true vacuum ( `` metastability '' ) . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we mostly discuss absolute stability and just give a brief comment on potential metastablity .    </S>",
    "<S> r0.5   [ fig : veff_phases ]    it turns out that for large field values @xmath45 one can not use truncated perturbation - theory ( pt ) series and has to reorganize ( improve ) the expansion . in a nutshell , </S>",
    "<S> the problem stems from the fact that beyond the tree - level approximation terms of the following form @xmath46^\\kappa , \\qquad       \\kappa = 1,\\dots , l        \\label{eq : logs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] will arise in @xmath47-loop contribution to @xmath38 . in @xmath48 corresponds to some normalization scale to define the sm running parameters . </S>",
    "<S> ] , at which a set of scale - dependent ( running ) couplings @xmath49 , @xmath50 is defined . </S>",
    "<S> the truncated finite - order result has residual dependence on @xmath48 and , obviously , has limited precision for @xmath51 . a well - known solution to this kind of problems </S>",
    "<S> is re - summation by means of renormalization group ( rg ) , which , roughly speaking , corresponds to the choice @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> further simplification can be achieved , when for large field values the full effective potential is approximated by the tree - level @xmath53 term @xmath54 with running @xmath55 in @xmath56 scheme @xcite . in the latter case _ only _ leading logarithmic ( ll ) contribution ( @xmath57 ) from can be re - summed consistently . applying the critical conditions to this simple case one obtains @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 corresponding to the beta - function of @xmath14 ( see below ) . as independent variables in one usually chooses @xmath48 and a physical mass of interest , either @xmath60 or @xmath61 . keeping all other parameters fixed , critical scale @xmath62 and critical mass @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) </S>",
    "<S> are deduced . from </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to convince oneself that the obtained @xmath64 corresponds to the upper bound on the physical mass , while @xmath63  to the lower bound .    strictly speaking , if one wants to go beyond the ll approximation , eq .   </S>",
    "<S> should be used in place of and non - logarithmic ( `` finite '' ) terms in @xmath23 should be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are known at two loops @xcite within the full sm . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to consistently re - summ next - to - next - to - leading ( nnll ) logarithmic terms ( @xmath65 ) by utilizing the system of coupled rg equations at the three - loop order    @xmath66    the appropriate boundary conditions are usually supplied at the ew scale @xmath67 gev . </S>",
    "<S> various @xmath68 represent @xmath69-loop contribution to the beta - function of @xmath70 and are known for the full sm up to the third order ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) . some leading four - loop corrections to the beta - functions </S>",
    "<S> were recently computed in the literature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary values are obtained by the so - called matching procedure , which relate the lagrangian parameters ( in the  scheme ) to a set of ( pseudo)observables . </S>",
    "<S> it is customary to use the pole masses of the sm bosons , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath60 , together with that of fermions @xmath73 to extract ( or match ) the relevant running parameters at the ew scale . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , matching can be done at any scale . however , again , truncated series exhibits bad behavior if @xmath48 is chosen far away from a typical scale involved in the definition of the observable , so matching is usually carried out at @xmath74 and rg is used for @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> two more constraints are required in order to completely determine the values of the sm parameters in the  scheme . </S>",
    "<S> they usually come from the requirement that the sm should reproduce fermi theory and qcd with five active flavours , when considered at scales far below the corresponding thresholds ( e.g. , @xmath71 or @xmath61 ) . in other words , given the sm one can predict the couplings @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the above - mentioned effective theories . at the end of the day , we have the relations of the form ( full set can be found , e.g. , in ref.@xcite ) @xmath78 in which rhs depend only on  parameters and the renormalization scale @xmath48 , while lhs , with the only exception of @xmath77 , are @xmath48-independent . </S>",
    "<S> various @xmath79 s represent radiative corrections and are calculated in pt . as in the case of effective potential , for consistent nnlo re - summation at least two - loop corrections in @xmath80 have to be included .    an important question should be raised when one deals with eqs .  : </S>",
    "<S> how do we define running vev @xmath81 entering these equations ? </S>",
    "<S> one option is to assume that @xmath82 is nothing else but the tree - level vev and , thus , gauge - independent . </S>",
    "<S> another common approach utilizes gauge - dependent solution @xmath83 of the equation @xmath84    both approaches have advantages and disadvantages . </S>",
    "<S> let us mention some of them . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , particle pole masses are usually identified with the physical ones . due to this , lhs of are independent of gauge - fixing parameters @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> if one treats @xmath81 as the tree - level vev , all @xmath37-dependence in rhs is explicit . </S>",
    "<S> the cancellation is maintained _ at the bare level _ </S>",
    "<S> order - by - order by the inclusion of diagrams with tadpoles attached to _ every _ particle coupled to the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the drawback of the approach is that the tadpole contributions , which typically scale as powers of @xmath85 , may spoil numerical `` convergence '' of pt series .    in the `` tadpole - free '' scheme based on @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> the running  masses become implicitly gauge - dependent and it is very hard to check the necessary cancellation in . </S>",
    "<S> computations in this case are usually carried out in the landau gauge @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this scheme lies in the fact the numerically dangerous tadpole terms are effectively re - summed in @xmath86 and explicitly contribute only in the higgs sector ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in our study we made use of the first approach . </S>",
    "<S> let us mention , however , that both options should converge to the same result when vev is consistently traded for the fermi constant @xmath76 by inverting the last relation of . </S>",
    "<S> this option was advocated , e.g. , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and renders explicitly gauge - independent relations for particle masses . </S>",
    "<S> the set of non - linear equations on the lagrangian parameters can be solved analytically in pt : @xmath88 , \\quad    % g^2(\\mu ) + g'^2(\\mu ) = 2^{5/2 } g_f m_z^2 [ 1 + \\delta_z(\\mu ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\    </S>",

    "<S> , we are not going to present the results for the sm couplings at the ew scale but just refer to our paper @xcite together with the c++ code  @xcite . in spite of the fact that different approaches to tadpoles were utilized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and our work , numerical results turns out to be very close to each other for the same input taken from pdg2014  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our analysis @xcite demonstrated that in @xcite theoretical uncertainty of the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath91 seems to be underestimated by a factor of 2 .    </S>",
