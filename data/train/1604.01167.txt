    "the nuclear rotation is one of the most typical collective motions in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "its semiclassical nature makes it possible to introduce the classical concepts like the rotational frequency and the transformation to the rotating frame , which are very useful to analyze the high - spin rotational bands  @xcite and nowadays provide a standard method called the cranked shell model  @xcite .",
    "however , the nucleus is a quantum many - body system and the basis of such a semiclassical treatment of the rotational motion is the symmetry breaking caused by the deformed mean - field , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the rotational motion emerges as a symmetry restoring collective motion of atomic nucleus as a whole and can be described full - quantum mechanically by the angular - momentum - projection method  @xcite .",
    "although a nice rotational spectrum can be obtained by the angular - momentum - projection from the deformed mean - field state , it has been known that the level spacing of the obtained rotational spectrum tends to be larger than that of the experimental data ; i.e. the moment of inertia is quite often underestimated .",
    "inclusion of the time - odd components into the deformed mean - field , from which the projection performed , improves this problem and it can be easily realized by the cranking procedure  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the small cranking frequency is enough to increase the moment of inertia and the result of projection does not depend on the actual value of the frequency ; we call it `` infinitesimal cranking '' for the angular - momentum - projection  @xcite .",
    "recently we have extended the study of the rotational motion by the angular - momentum - projection method  @xcite . namely the cranking procedure is combined with the projection by employing the configuration - mixing with respect to the finite rotational frequency",
    "; we call it angular - momentum - projected multi - cranked configuration - mixing .",
    "this method was originally proposed by peierls and thouless long time ago  @xcite , but has not been taken seriously .",
    "we have applied it to a few examples to show that it gives a reliable description of the rotational motion at high - spin states  @xcite .",
    "the angular - momentum - projected configuration - mixing with respect to a few cranked mean - field states has recently been performed also in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as for the application of the angular - momentum - projection method to the nuclear rotational motion ,",
    "many pioneering works have been done by the projected shell model , see e.g. ref .  @xcite . while the basic idea is the same , much larger but simple configurations , like the zero- , two- , four- ,",
    "... , quasiparticle excited bands are mixed in the sense of the shell model .",
    "we believe the multi - cranked configuration - mixing  @xcite is an alternative , which incorporates a relatively small number of mean - field configurations with the help of the cranking procedure .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to demonstrate that the multi - cranked configuration - mixing is indeed a reliable method to describe the rotational band with the angular - momentum - projection method .",
    "we first apply the method to the ground - state rotational bands for a number of selected nuclei in the rare earth region . at high - spin states",
    ", it is well - known that the band crossing ( back - bending ) phenomenon between the ground - state ( g- ) band and the stockholm ( s- ) band , i.e. , the two - neutron aligned band , occurs .",
    "therefore , we try to study the s - band in a typical nucleus @xmath0er with the same multi - cranked configuration - mixing method ; we are able to study the g- and s - bands separately without the inter - band mixing .",
    "the cranked mean - field states are determined selfconsistently by the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method for given rotational frequencies employing the finite - range gogny interaction  @xcite with the d1s parameter set  @xcite .",

    "our basic approach to study the high - spin states of the nuclear collective rotation is the angular - momentum - projected configuration - mixing , or the projected generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , where the cranking frequency @xmath1 is employed as a generator coordinate .",
    "it was first proposed by peierls - thouless  @xcite , and the wave function is calculated by @xmath2 where the operator @xmath3 is the angular momentum projector , and the mean - field wave function , @xmath4 , is obtained by the selfconsistent cranking procedure with the cranked hamiltonian , @xmath5 , @xmath6 in the present work , the ground - state mean - field states are axially deformed and the cranking axis is chosen to be the @xmath7-axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis ( @xmath8-axis ) . practically we discretize the generator coordinate , i.e. , the cranking frequency , as ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) in eq .",

    "as for the neutron and proton chemical potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 we use those obtained for the hfb ground - state .",
    "we have recently developed an efficient method for the angular - momentum - projection and the configuration - mixing  @xcite .",
    "this method is fully utilized also in the present work . to solve the hfb equation and to perform the projection calculation",
    "the harmonic oscillator basis expansion is employed .",
    "more details of our theoretical framework can be found in refs .",
    "as it is mentioned we employ the gogny force with the d1s parameter set  @xcite as an effective interaction .",
    "therefore there is no ambiguity for the hamiltonian .",
    "the hfb equation is solved in the space generated by the isotropic harmonic oscillator potential with the frequency @xmath20 mev .",
    "the size of the space is controlled by the oscillator quantum number @xmath21 ; all the basis states satisfying @xmath22 are included .",
    "we use @xmath23 for the following systematic calculations of the rotational spectra .",

[ cols=\"^,<,^,<,^,<,^,<,^,^,<,^,^,<,^ \" , ]     the result of the deformation parameter @xmath37 roughly corresponds to experimental data deduced by the measured @xmath38 values  @xcite , but the calculated @xmath37 are slightly smaller .",
    "this is merely due to the differences in the definitions of @xmath37 in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present work .",
    "the calculated radius @xmath29 is 2.42.9% larger than the empirical value @xmath39 [ fm ] , which is mostly due to the effect of deformation . in these stable nuclei",
    "the difference of the radius from the empirical value is not so large , but for the unstable nuclei the difference is expected to be larger .",
    "therefore , it is important to measure the nuclear radius to reliably extract the deformation parameters  @xcite .    as for the average pairing gaps selfconsistently calculated values",
    "are smaller than the even - odd mass differences in most cases . especially the neutron pairing gap in @xmath40gd is only 65% of the even - odd mass difference , and in @xmath41yb the calculated average gaps for both the neutron and proton are about 27% smaller .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath42gd , @xmath43dy and @xmath0dy , the calculated gaps relatively well correspond to the even - odd mass differences , and their differences are less than 14% . as it is discussed in the following ,",
    "the agreement of the calculated gaps with the even - odd mass differences is crucial to reproduce the moments of inertia of the g - band .",

    "therefore , we take @xmath45 and choose them ( almost ) equidistantly .",
    "since the ground - state rotational band is studied , only the frequencies before the g - s crossing should be selected ; we choose @xmath46 mev as in ref .",
    "@xcite , for most of nuclei in table  [ tab : mf_rare ] . however , it is known that there is no sharp g - s crossing observed in n=98 isotopes , so that we choose @xmath47 mev for @xmath0dy and @xmath48yb .",

    "( [ eq : proj ] ) , the superposition of the states with respect to @xmath57 for given @xmath58 is overcomplete and there are vanishingly small norm states , which causes numerical problems  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the norm cut - off should be done ; namely , the eigenvalues of the norm kernel are first calculated and the small norm states should be excluded when solving the hill - wheeler eq .",
    "( [ eq : hw ] ) .",
    "the value for the norm cut - off is better to be as small as possible not to miss important contributions .",
    "we start from the value @xmath59 and increase it to avoid the numerical problems in each case .",
    "the actual values used in the following calculation are also denoted in table  [ tab : mf_rare ] ; they are in the range , @xmath60 .",
    "figures  [ fig : eir1 ] and  [ fig : eir2 ] show the resultant rotational spectra of the configuration - mixing for the ground - state bands in nuclei in table  [ tab : mf_rare ] .",
    "the results of the simple projection from one cranked hfb state with small frequency @xmath61  mev , i.e. , those of the infinitesimal cranking , are also included .",
    "the experimental data are taken from the table of isotope homepage  @xcite . to show the detail we subtract the reference rotational energy , @xmath62 mev , in each spectrum . by comparing the results of the configuration - mixing and of",
    "the simple projection from one infinitesimally cranked hfb state in these figures , it is clear that the infinitesimal cranking gives a good description of the low - spin states .",
    "however , the deviations become non - negligible quickly at higher spins , @xmath63 . with the multi - cranked configuration - mixing the energy gain at @xmath64 from the simple projection",
    "is about @xmath65 mev , and therefore the effect of configuration - mixing is crucial for the description of the high - spin states .    in comparison with the experimental spectra ,",
    "the results of the configuration - mixing reproduce the bending - down behaviors of the data at higher spins , which reflects the increase of moments of inertia .",
    "in contrast , the spectra of the simple projection with the infinitesimal cranking do not change or even increase as spin increases , which means that the moments of inertia obtained by the simple projection are rather constant .",
    "the deviation of the calculated spectrum from the measured spectrum is rather large in @xmath40gd , @xmath66dy , @xmath42er , and @xmath41yb , for which the average pairing gaps are considerably smaller than the even - odd mass differences , especially for neutron , see table  [ tab : mf_rare ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreements are almost perfect for @xmath42gd , @xmath43dy , @xmath0dy , and @xmath0yb , in which the calculated average pairing gaps for both neutron and proton well correspond to the even - odd mass differences .",
    "thus the reproduction of the pairing properties is very important to achieve a good description of the ground - state rotational band , which is a rather well - known fact .",
    "it should be emphasized that the agreements for other nuclei are rather satisfactory considering the fact that we have no room for adjustment in the present calculations .",
    "the relative difference between the isotopes , e.g. , between @xmath43er and @xmath0er , or between @xmath0yb and @xmath48yb , is also reproduced .",
    "to study the rotational property in more detail , we show the first ( or kinematic ) moment of inertia in figs .",

    "it should be noticed that the cranked hfb inertia in eq .",
    "( [ eq : j1chfb ] ) at high - spin states after the alignment of two quasineutrons should be considered to be that of the s - band and the inertia is unphysical in the band crossing region .",
    "the irregularities seen in the experimental moment of inertia are due to the effect of the g - s band crossing .",
    "it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : emo1 ] and  [ fig : emo2 ] that the moments of inertia for the ground - state band increase gradually as functions of spin .",
    "this behavior is quite nicely reproduced by the multi - cranked configuration - mixing calculations .",
    "the values of moment of inertia are considerably overestimated at low - spins in @xmath40gd , @xmath66dy , @xmath42er , and @xmath41yb ; again this is mainly because the calculated pairing gaps are markedly smaller than the even - odd mass differences . in these nuclei",
    "the amounts of increase for the moment of inertia are also much smaller than the experimental data .",
    "this indicates that the increase of the moment of inertia is mainly related to the reduction of the pairing correlations at higher spins .",
    "the agreements between the calculated and measured inertias are excellent for @xmath42gd , @xmath43dy , @xmath0dy , and @xmath0yb in the whole spin range shown in the figures . for the other cases , @xmath66gd , @xmath43er , @xmath0er , and @xmath48yb , the deviations of the calculated moments of inertia from the experimental data are less than 20% , which is quite non trivial .",
    "the different spin - dependence observed between the isotopes , e.g. , between @xmath43er and @xmath0er , is also nicely reproduced by the configuration - mixing calculations .",
    "the inertia calculated by the cranked hfb at low - spin is slightly larger than the result of configuration - mixing ; the large increase of the cranked hfb inertia is caused by the effect of the two - neutron alignment mentioned above .",
    "it should be emphasized that the moment of inertia obtained by the simple projection from the non - cranked hfb state ( not shown in the present work ) is about 3040% smaller than the result of the infinitesimal cranking  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the time - odd components of the wave functions with @xmath70 and the subsequent @xmath56-mixing is very important to reproduce the correct magnitude of the moments of inertia .            in figures  [ fig : emm1 ] and",
    "[ fig : emm2 ] we show how the moments of inertia is changed by the multi - cranked configuration - mixing .",
    "namely , the inertias calculated by the simple projection from one intrinsic hfb state with five frequencies are compared with the result of the configuration - mixing",
    ". the calculated inertias with higher cranking frequencies are generally larger because of the coriolis anti - pairing effect .",
    "however , those calculated by the simple projection from one hfb states are almost constant as spin increases or even decrease in several cases . in contrast , the resultant inertias of the configuration - mixing always increase as functions of spin in accordance with experimental data . in this way",
    "the configuration - mixing is important to obtain gradually increasing behavior , which is general for the g - band in the rare earth region .",
    "note , however , that the amount of increase is quite different in each nucleus ; there is a trend that if the difference between the inertias calculated with different cranking frequencies at high - spin is large , then the amount of increase is larger .",
    "it is interesting to note that the behaviors of calculated inertias by the simple projection with finite frequencies are rather different in each nucleus .",
    "for example , all five results of the simple projection are similar in @xmath0er , while they are considerably different in @xmath41yb .",
    "however , the results of the configuration - mixing make the behaviors of moment of inertia in all nuclei rather similar , i.e. , gradually increasing as functions of spin .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the result of the infinitesimal cranking , i.e. , the calculated inertia with @xmath61 mev coincides with that of the configuration - mixing at low - spins in most cases .",
    "this clearly shows that the infinitesimal cranking is enough for a good description of the rotational band at low - spin states , although the configuration - mixing is crucial at high - spin states .      in the previous section only the g - band",
    "is considered . however , it is well - known that a different rotational band intersects with the g - band and becomes the yrast state at higher spin values .",
    "this band is called the s - band , in which two quasineutrons are excited to align their angular momenta to the axis of collective rotation .",
    "the band crossing between the g- and s - bands is the origin of the back - bending phenomenon first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the rotational frequency decreases when spin increases along the yrast line .",
    "how this alignment of the two quasineutron occurs can be nicely understand by the semiclassical cranking model , see e.g. refs .",
    "we have shown that the g - band can be nicely described by our multi - cranked configuration - mixing method .",
    "therefore it is natural to study the s - band with the same method .",

    "this is non trivial because we have no kind of adjustment in the present calculation .",
    "it should be emphasized that the g- and s - bands are calculated independently without the inter - band mixing ; the effect of the inter - band mixing is not taken into account in the present work .",
    "the reason why the calculated crossing is delayed is that the calculated excitation energies of the s - band are higher than the experimental data ; the excitation energy of @xmath79 state is 2.69 mev , which is about 170 kev higher than the experimentally measured one .    in figs .",

    "[ fig : er164gb5 m ] it can be seen that the five spectra for the g - band , each of which is obtained from the one cranked state with @xmath80 mev , are rather similar , and the energy gain by the configuration - mixing is larger at higher spin , which leads to the increase of the moment of inertia as a function of spin .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath56-mixing and configuration - mixing induced by the cranking is more effective at higher spins ; the hill - wheeler equation  ( [ eq : hw ] ) should be solved even for the case of projection from a single hfb state and its dimension of increases as spin increases .",
    "in contrast , the four spectra for the s - band obtained from the one cranked state with @xmath81 mev are rather different as is shown in fig .",

    "non of the spectra looks like the observed one and the configuration - mixing is very important for the s - band to obtain the correct spectrum .",
    "each spectrum in figs .",
    "[ fig : er164sb4 m ] has a minimum energy at a finite spin value , and the spin value that gives a minimum is larger for the spectrum obtained from the cranked hfb with larger cranking frequency .",

    "note that the aligned angular momentum of the two quasineutrons is estimated to be about 10 @xmath83 in @xmath0er .",

    "thus , the description of the s - band is not as simple as in the case of the g - band , especially in the low - spin region , @xmath96 .",
    "it may not , however , be a serious problem because the s - bands for such low - spin parts have not been observed in experiments and it is difficult to compare with experimental data . in any case",
    ", we need to study further for more satisfactory description of the s - band .",
    "we have investigated the rotational bands in the rare earth nuclei by employing our recently developed microscopic framework , the angular - momentum - projected multi - cranked configuration - mixing method  @xcite . in this method several cranked hfb states are utilized with a suitably chosen set of rotational frequencies .",
    "we use the gogny force with the d1s parameter set as an effective interaction , and there is no ambiguity for the hamiltonian .    we first apply our method to the g - band of various selected nuclei in the rare earth region .",
    "reasonably good overall agreements are obtained for the energy spectra and the moments of inertia up to about @xmath97 . in a few cases",
    "the moments of inertia at low spin are considerably overestimated and the increase of the inertia as a function of spin is not enough compared with the experimental data .",
    "it is found that the selfconsistently calculated pairing correlations are too weak for such nuclei ; the average pairing gaps for both neutrons and protons are only about 70% of or even less than the even - odd mass differences .",
    "if the pairing properties are nicely reproduced , the agreements of the moments of inertia are found to be excellent . in this way",
    "we have confirmed that our method is capable to reliably describe the nuclear rotational motion near the ground state .",
    "next we apply our approach to the study of the s - band in the nucleus @xmath0er for the first time .",
    "the method of calculation is the same for the s - band ; the only difference is that the cranked hfb states with higher rotational frequencies are employed for the configuration - mixing , in which the two quasineutrons align their angular momenta .",
    "thus the g- and s - bands can be calculated separately without the inter - band mixing between them .",
    "the band crossing between the g- and s - bands can be reproduced , although the spin value , at which the two bands cross , is slightly larger than the observed one .",
    "the calculated moment of inertia of the s - band is overestimated especially at high - spin states .",
    "this is mainly because the selfconsistently calculated pairing correlation for neutrons vanishes in the cranked hfb states due to the alignment of two quasineutrons , which can not be avoided as long as the gogny d1s force is employed .",
    "it is found that the result of configuration - mixing weakly depends on the choice of the set of cranking frequencies for the s - band , especially in the lower spin region , in contrast to the case of the g - band , where the result is independent of the choice of frequencies .",
    "thus , further investigation is necessary for the proper description of the s - band , which is an important future work .",
