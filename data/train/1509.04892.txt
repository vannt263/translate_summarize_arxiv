    "subsequent to the pioneering work by ramaika et al.@xcite , the ternary intermetallic stannides with general formula @xmath8 have attracted considerable attention in the recent past . here",
    "r is an alkaline or rare earth metal and m is a transition metal .",
    "there is renewed interest in these compounds because of their manifold properties such as occurrence of charge density wave ( cdw ) , coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism , thermoelectric properties , and kondo lattice etc[1 - 19 ] .",
    "in particular , the compound @xmath0 crystallizes in a cubic structure ( space group pm-3n ) which is analogous to @xmath9 and belongs to the skutterudite sub - family .",
    "the exciting properties of skutterudites , as thermoelectric materials and towards realization of unconventional superconductivity , rest with their peculiar lattice arrangement . as depicted in inset of figure[fig1 ] ,",
    "the basic structural unit is a polyhedral cage with the transition metal at the centre . when the cage is large compared to trapped atoms , the anharmonic phonon modes of transition metal couples with electrons of the cage leading to enhanced electron - phonon correlation .",
    "@xmath0 has been found to be a superconductor with a transition temperature ( @xmath10 ) of about 2.5 k along with coexisting cdw and structural distortion @xcite .",
    "such intermetallic superconductors are extremely susceptible to lattice instabilities and a recent high pressure study on @xmath0 has confirmed a rare instance of increase in @xmath10 with pressure @xcite .",
    "moreover several other @xmath8 compounds exhibit higher superconducting transition .",
    "the examples include @xmath11 ( 8.7 k ) , @xmath9 ( 5 k ) and @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , smaller ca ion results in @xmath14 higher than @xmath15 which is reflective of increased @xmath10 under chemical pressure @xcite . in this communication",
    ", we report over two fold increase in superconducting transition temperature in @xmath0 by partial substitution of indium in place of tin .",
    "we note that atomic radius of indium is larger than tin and we provide a detailed investigation of band structure on superconducting properties of indium doped @xmath0 .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature of @xmath16 increased from 2.5 k for undoped @xmath0 to 5.1 k with 10% indium substitution . in effect , our results establish the possibility of fine tuning of lattice instabilities and density of states at fermi level in caged skutterudite @xmath0 by chemical substitution towards achieving higher @xmath17 phases .",
    "the stannide samples were synthesized by melting metals in a single - arc furnace ( miller ) .",
    "a series of @xmath16 ( where x = 0 , 0.65 and 1.3 corresponding to 0% , 5% and 10% indium substitution ) were synthesized in two steps .",
    "all the constituent elements , la(99.99% ) , in(99.999% ) , sn(99.999% ) , co(99.999% ) , were taken in proper stoichiometric ratio and melted on the water cooled copper hearth by arc melting in argon atmosphere .",
    "the melted ingots were ground , palletized and then sealed in quartz ampoules in @xmath18 mbar vacuum and annealed at @xmath19 for 12 days .",
    "room - temperature x - ray diffraction measurement was done with cu - k@xmath20 radiation by rigaku powder x - ray diffractometer ( miniflex-600 ) .",
    "all the samples were identified within the expected cubic @xmath9-type phase ( space group pm-3n ) .",
    "edax and sem data were obtained from bruker axs micro - analyser and from zeiss evo40 sem analyzer respectively .",
    "several points were selected and averaged to get the actual atomic percentage of the samples .",
    "the resistivity was measured using linear four probe technique using copper wire and silver epoxy .",
    "magnetization measurements were carried out using 14 tesla @xmath21 physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "pressure - dependent resistivity measurements were performed in the physical property measurements system ( ppms-14 t , quantum design ) using an hpc-33 piston type pressure cell with quantum design dc resistivity option .",

    "evidently , there are two positions for sn atoms ; those that are at the corners of unit cell ( sn1 ) and the rest that form the polyhedra enclosing the co atom at the center ( sn2 ) . thus co and sn2 atoms form corner sharing @xmath22 trigonal prisms .",

    "we discuss the electronic density of states analysis of @xmath0 . using vasp 5.3 codes",
    "we have studied the electronic band structure of @xmath0 and its possible tunability towards achieving higher @xmath29 phases by chemical substitution . for the calculation of band structure and density of state of the parent compound , we employed paw ( projected augmented waves ) and plane wave basis set of 360 ev cut off .",
    "the dft calculations were performed using gga - pbe ( generalized gradient approximation - perdewburke ernzerhof ) approximations . typically @xmath30 mesh points were used with k - point grid of @xmath31 to achieve optimal convergence .",

    "it is evident that that the parent compound is metallic in nature .",
    "the density of state at fermi level ( figure[fig3](b ) ) reveals that there is strong hybridization of co 3d orbital and sn 5p orbital that contributes to observed superconductivity . at the fermi level",
    "the value of dos is around 15 states / ev [ in formula unit ] , which reconfirm metallicity in the parent compound .",
    "presumably , superconductivity arises due to orbital hybridization of sn2 and co atoms .",
    "the outer sn1 atoms at the corners of the unit cell , do not contribute to superconductivity .",
    "in effect , the tuning of superconducting properties of this skutterudite would depend on effective modification of the density of states at fermi level by appropriate substitution at the sn2 site .",
    "further , as seen in figure[fig3](c ) , only positive frequencies are seen in phonon dispersion curve indicating absence of structural instability .",
    "this is in contrast to what was reported from specific heat measurements by liu et al.@xcite . in the skutterudite family ,",
    "structural instabilities were also reported in @xmath15 and @xmath12 where negative frequencies in phonon dispersion curves were observed .",
    "this was associated with cdw transitions around 147 k and 35 k respectively @xcite .",
    "but we find no evidence for such instabilities either in the parent or in substituted @xmath0 .",

    "figure[fig4 ] shows the temperature dependence of resistivity from 1.7 k to 300 k for @xmath16(x = 0 , 0.65 and 1.3 ) .",
    "the insets show magnified superconducting transition and fermi liquid fitting . as seen in inset of figure[fig4](a ) , the parent @xmath0 shows @xmath33 = 2.5 k and @xmath34 = 1.77 k. this value is in accordance with earlier reports @xcite .",
    "most notably , there is significant enhancement in superconducting transition to @xmath33 = 4.7 k and @xmath34= 3.2 k for 5% indium doped @xmath35 compound . on careful analysis",
    "we find the deviation from normal state resistivity actually begins from 5.3 k ( inset ( i ) figure [ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "this is suggestive of inhomogeneous distribution of grains .",
    "more striking is the low temperature resistivity data of @xmath6 ( inset ( i ) figure[fig4](c ) ) where an extremely sharp transition of @xmath33 = 5.1 k is seen with transition width @xmath36 t @xmath37 0.1k .",
    "this is more than two times than that for the parent compound .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) for @xmath16 is found to be 2.18 , 1.37 and 2.15 for x = 0 , 0.65 and 1.3 respectively .",

    "in contrast , iso - structural compounds with ge at the sn place , i.e. @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 etc show semiconducting behaviour in normal state @xcite .",
    "the reason for different normal state conduction mechanism is attributed to the atomic displacement parameter ( adp ) and compounds with smaller adp are found to exhibit metallic ground state while those with large adp have semiconducting ground state @xcite . moreover , no evidence for the presence of cdw is observed either in the parent or in the indium doped samples which has been observed in other stannides such as @xmath15 and @xmath12 @xcite . in @xmath15 the cdw emerges because of structural transition from simple cubic to a body centered cubic superstructure with doubling of the cell parameter below 147 k. this is confirmed by optical spectroscopy , hall , specific heat and nmr measurements @xcite .",
    "a first - order phase transition has been observed in single - crystal of @xmath0 with a marked peak at t @xmath37152 k by specific heat and nmr measurements@xcite .",
    "the observed transition has been related to a structural change from a simple cubic to a body - centred - cubic super - structure with crystallographic cell doubling .",
    "but we do not observe this behaviour in our polycrystalline samples .",
    "further , we did not find any anomaly in the specific heat measurements ( not included here ) around the reported cdw transition temperature range .",
