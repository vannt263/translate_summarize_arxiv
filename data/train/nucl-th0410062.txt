    "the physics of @xmath0-hypernuclei has a long and well documented history @xcite .",

    "the empirical single - particle energies of a @xmath0-hyperon bound in hypernuclei are well described in terms of an attractive mean field about half as strong as the one for nucleons in nuclei @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the extraordinary weakness of the @xmath0-nucleus spin - orbit interaction , as compared to the one in ordinary nuclei , has always been a puzzle .",
    "for example , recent precision measurements @xcite of e1-transitions from @xmath7- to @xmath8-shell orbitals of a @xmath0-hyperon in @xmath9 give a @xmath10 spin - orbit splitting of only @xmath11kev , to be compared with about 6mev in ordinary p - shell nuclei . even admitting a large uncertainty in the hypernuclear case ,",
    "the @xmath0-nuclear spin - orbit interactions appears to be systematically weaker by at least an order of magnitude than the n - nucleus spin - orbit force .",
    "various attempts have been made to understand this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "so far , standard calculations using one - boson exchange @xmath1-potentials @xcite tend to overestimate the @xmath0-nucleus spin - orbit splitting significantly .",
    "more recently , in - medium effective field theory approaches have opened new perspectives for dealing with these issues in ordinary nuclei , both symmetric and asymmetric in isospin . in this work",
    "we take steps towards including strangeness in such a framework .",

    "we choose as their values @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to a @xmath27-coupling constant of @xmath28 and a @xmath29-coupling constant of @xmath30 which are both consistent with the empirical values summarized in tab.6.3 and 6.4 of ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pion - nucleon coupling constant has the value @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "apart from these three pseudovector @xmath27- , @xmath33- and @xmath34-couplings , no further interaction terms from @xmath35 come into play to the order we are working here .",

    "the isospin factors of the kaon- and pion - exchange diagrams are 2 and 6 , respectively . ]",
    "consider first the density dependent mean field @xmath37 for a zero - momentum @xmath0-hyperon placed as a test particle in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the potential depth @xmath38 at equilibrium density @xmath39@xmath40 determines primarily the spectra of medium heavy and heavy @xmath0-hypernuclei .",
    "we calculate the long - range contributions generated by the exchange of light goldstone bosons between the @xmath0-hyperon and the nucleons in the filled fermi sea .",
    "the only non - vanishing one - meson exchange contribution comes from the kaon - exchange fock diagram in fig.1 , from which we obtain the following repulsive contribution to the @xmath0-nuclear mean - field : @xmath41 with @xmath42mev the average kaon mass . at densities at and below nuclear matter saturation density @xmath43@xmath40",
    "( corresponding to fermi momenta @xmath44mev ) the one - kaon exchange can already be regarded as being of short range .",
    "the ratio @xmath45 is small and the expression in curly brackets of eq.(2 ) is dominated by its leading term @xmath46 in the @xmath47-expansion .",
    "since one - pion exchange is excluded by isospin invariance , the leading long - range interaction between the @xmath0-hyperon and the nucleons arises from two - pion exchange .",
    "the corresponding two - loop diagrams with a @xmath2-hyperon in the intermediate state are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the small @xmath6-mass splitting @xmath48mev which comes into play here is comparable in magnitude to @xmath49 , twice the typical kinetic energies of the nucleons .",
    "therefore it has to be counted accordingly in the energy denominator . putting all pieces together we find from the second diagram in fig.1 the following attractive contribution to the @xmath0-nuclear mean field : @xmath50 } + { \\cal o}(m_b^{-1 } ) \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath51mev the average pion mass .",
    "the mean baryon mass @xmath52mev serves the purpose of averaging out differences in the kinetic energies of the various baryons involved .",
    "the relation @xmath53 for the @xmath6-mass splitting defines another small mass scale @xmath54 .",
    "its magnitude @xmath55mev is close to the fermi - momentum @xmath56mev at saturation density . as it stands the @xmath57-loop integral in eq.(3 )",
    "is ultraviolet divergent . by subtracting @xmath58 from the integrand it becomes convergent and analytically solvable .",
    "after regularizing the remaining ( structureless ) linear divergence @xmath59 by a momentum cut - off @xmath60 we get : @xmath61 with the function @xmath62 emerging from the combined loop and fermi - sphere integration , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the branch point of the function @xmath65 at @xmath66",
    "is related to the kinematical threshold for the ( on - shell ) scattering process @xmath67 .",
    "this threshold is reached only at very high densities , @xmath68@xmath40 .",
    "note that the decomposition in eq.(4 ) is optimal from the point of view of separating effects from high and low mass scales .",
    "the ( high - momentum ) cut - off scale @xmath60 effectively parameterizes the strength of an attractive @xmath1-contact interaction .",
    "no dependence on the two low - mass scales , @xmath69 and @xmath54 , is left over in the corresponding term linear in the nucleon density @xmath70 .",
    "the third diagram in fig.1 with crossed pion - lines corresponds to irreducible two - pion exchange between the @xmath0-hyperon and the nucleons . at leading order in the small momentum expansion",
    "it is exactly canceled by a @xmath16-independent contribution from the second diagram in fig.1 ( with parallel pion - lines ) .",
    "note that the same exact cancellation between the planar and crossed box graphs is at work in the isoscalar central channel of the @xmath71-exchange nn - potential ( for details see sect.4.2 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus we are left with the pauli - blocking correction to the iterated pion - exchange diagram with intermediate @xmath2-states . from the last diagram in fig.1 we find the following repulsive contribution to the @xmath0-nuclear mean field : @xmath72 ^ 2\\ ,    [ \\delta^2 + { \\vec p_2}^{\\,2 } -\\vec p_1 \\cdot \\vec p_2 ] } + { \\cal o}(m_b^{-1})\\,.\\ ] ] after performing the angular integrations this expression reduces to an easily manageable two - dimensional integral : @xmath73 with the abbreviations @xmath74 and @xmath64 .     of a @xmath0-hyperon in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter versus the nucleon density @xmath75 .",
    "the cut - off scale @xmath60 has been adjusted to the value @xmath76gev . ]    summing up all terms , fig.2 shows the calculated @xmath0-nuclear mean field @xmath37 as a function of the nucleon density @xmath77 .",
    "the cut - off scale has been adjusted to the value @xmath78gev .",
    "at normal nuclear matter density @xmath79@xmath40 ( corresponding to @xmath80mev ) one finds @xmath81mev@xmath82mev , where the individual entries correspond to one - kaon exchange , iterated one - pion exchange with intermediate @xmath83-states , and the pauli - blocking correction to the latter .",
    "note that the physically reasonable cut - off scale @xmath84gev which reproduces the empirical potential depth @xmath85mev @xcite is close to @xmath86gev needed to reproduce the empirical saturation point of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter in the same framework @xcite .",
    "this is a remarkable and non - trivial feature . at the present stage of our calculation",
    "all other possible contributions to the @xmath0-nuclear mean field @xmath37 from @xmath87-exchange , @xmath88-exchange etc .",
    "are hidden in the adjusted value of the cut - off @xmath89gev , or equivalently , in the contact term which encodes short - distance dynamics not resolved at momentum scales around @xmath90 . at the densities of interest",
    "all those effects can be regarded as being of short range nature and therefore they are summarized by this single term linear in the nucleon density @xmath70 .",
    "the empirical finding that the @xmath0-nucleus spin - orbit coupling is negligibly small in comparison to the strong spin - orbit interaction of nucleons in ordinary nuclei presents an outstanding problem in low - energy hadron physics . in relativistic scalar - vector mean field models",
    "a strong tensor coupling of the @xmath91-meson to the @xmath0-hyperon , equal and of opposite sign to the vector - coupling , has been proposed as a possible solution @xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate here that there is a more natural source of cancellation in the hypernuclear many - body problem .    the pertinent quantity to extract",
    "the @xmath0-nuclear spin - orbit coupling is the spin - dependent part of the selfenergy of a @xmath0-hyperon interacting with weakly inhomogeneous isospin - symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "let the @xmath0-hyperon scatter from initial momentum @xmath92 to final momentum @xmath93 .",
    "the spin - orbit part of the selfenergy in the weakly inhomogeneous medium is then @xcite : @xmath94 where the density - dependent spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath95 is taken in the limit of homogeneous nuclear matter ( characterized by its fermi momentum @xmath47 ) and zero external @xmath0-momenta : @xmath96 .",
    "the more familiar spin - orbit hamiltonian of the shell model follows from eq.(8 ) by multiplication with a density form factor and fourier transformation : @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the normalized nuclear density profile with @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the orbital angular momentum . for reference and orientation , consider first the frequently used simple model of isoscalar vector boson ( @xmath91-meson ) exchange between the @xmath0-hyperon and the nucleon .",
    "the non - relativistic expansion of the vector ( and tensor ) coupling vertex between dirac spinors of the @xmath0-hyperon gives rise to a spin - orbit term proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "next one takes the limit of homogeneous nuclear matter ( i.e. @xmath102 ) , performs the remaining integral over the nuclear fermi sphere and arrives at the familiar result : @xmath103 linear in the nucleon density @xmath104 . here",
    ", @xmath105 is a coupling strength of dimension ( length)@xmath106 which includes the @xmath91-baryon coupling constants , a possible tensor coupling of the @xmath91-meson to the @xmath0-hyperon with @xmath107 the tensor - to - vector coupling ratio , and the @xmath91-meson mass @xmath108 . in the absence of @xmath109 and assuming that the @xmath91-meson does not couple to the strange quark in the @xmath0-hyperon , one would naively expect @xmath110 to be @xmath111 of the corresponding piece of the nn - interaction for which @xmath112 fm@xmath106 .",
    "evidently , an almost vanishing @xmath0-nuclear spin - orbit force would be difficult to understand at this stage unless one postulates a much reduced coupling @xmath114 or a sizeable and negative tensor - to - vector coupling ratio @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the important observation is now that iterated one - pion exchange with an intermediate @xmath2-hyperon also generates a sizeable spin - orbit coupling , with a sign opposite to that expected from the short - range interactions .",
    "the prefactor @xmath116 is immediately identified by rewriting the product of @xmath117-interaction vertices @xmath118 at the open baryon line in the @xmath71-exchange process shown by the second diagram in fig.1 . for all remaining parts of the iterated pion - exchange diagram",

    "their input parameters ( couplings constants and masses ) are physical quantities and thus uniquely fixed .",
    "note that these spin - orbit couplings are not relativistic effects : they are even proportional to the baryon mass @xmath16 .",
    "this large scale enhancement factor originates from the energy denominator of the iterated pion - exchange diagram .",
    "the expressions in eqs.(12,15 ) constitute the unique long - range @xmath0-nuclear spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the summed contributions from these @xmath71-exchange processes are shown by the lower solid line in fig.3 .",
    "they are of comparable magnitude but of opposite sign with respect to the short - range pieces mentioned earlier . the short - range part of the @xmath0-nuclear spin - orbit interaction results from a variety of processes , one of them being the isoscalar - vector exchange piece discussed previously .",
    "we relate the short - distance spin - orbit coupling of the @xmath0-hyperon to the corresponding one of the nucleon as follows : @xmath126 the factor @xmath127 results from the replacement of the nucleon by a @xmath0-hyperon in these relativistic spin - orbit terms . the coefficient @xmath128 parameterizes the ratio of the relevant coupling strengths .",
    "the upper limit expected from naive quark model considerations is @xmath129 .",
    "estimates from a qcd sum rule analysis of the lorentz scalar and vector mean fields of a @xmath0-hyperon in a nuclear medium @xcite indicate that @xmath128 is smaller than its naive quark model value , partly as consequence of flavor - su(3 ) breaking .",
    "for nucleons in nuclei , large lorentz scalar and vector mean fields with their in - medium behavior governed by qcd sum rules can explain the strong spin - orbit coupling in calculations which combine these mean fields with the long- and intermediate range attraction provided by perturbative chiral pion - nucleon dynamics @xcite .",
    "consider now the leading terms of the vector selfenergies @xmath130 , linear in the quark density @xmath131 , in a nuclear medium with only u- and d - quarks . from ref.@xcite one",
    "estimates roughly @xmath132 for the ratio of vector mean fields experienced by a @xmath0-hyperon and a nucleon .",
    "corrections from in - medium condensates of higher dimension tend to reduce this ratio further . for the lorentz scalar mean fields , the qcd sum rule results are subject to larger uncertainties due to the unknown contributions from four - quark condensates . on the other hand , at least some of these contributions are accounted for by our explicit treatment of two - pion exchange processes .",
    "we therefore assume as a reasonable estimate , guided by @xcite , a factor @xmath133 for both the scalar and vector selfenergies which act coherently to produce the short - range spin - orbit force and cancel in the spin - averaged single - particle potential @xmath37 . in practice",
    ", we shall vary @xmath128 between 1/2 and 2/3 .     of a @xmath0-hyperon in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter versus the nucleon density @xmath70 .",

    "phenomenological skyrme forces @xcite give approximately the same value @xmath139mevfm@xmath106 ( with @xmath140mev@xmath141 the spin - orbit parameter in the skyrme phenomenology ) .",

    "one observes a strong cancellation between the short- and long - range contributions .",
    "this so far unnoticed balance between sizeable  correct - sign  and  wrong - sign  spin - orbit terms for the @xmath0-hyperon offers a novel and natural explanation for the empirically observed small spin - orbit splittings in @xmath0-hypernuclei , although with still persisting uncertainties in the short - range contribution .",
    "it is important to note that such a ",
    "wrong - sign  spin - orbit interaction from iterated one - pion exchange ( entirely through the second - order tensor force ) exists indeed also for nucleons ( see fig.4 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it has however been found recently that three - body spin - orbit forces generated by @xmath71-exchange with virtual @xmath147-isobar excitation compensate this contribution to a large extent @xcite ( see fig.2 therein ) , leaving room for additional short - distance contributions . in the case of the @xmath0-hyperon",
    "the analogous three - body effects with virtual @xmath148-isobar excitation are not possible and therefore the sizeable  wrong - sign  spin - orbit interaction generated by iterated pion - exchange becomes visible .",
    "the absence of analogous three - body mechanisms for the @xmath0-hyperon becomes immediately clear by inspection of the relevant @xmath71-exchange diagram in fig.4 .",
    "replacing the external nucleon by a @xmath0-hyperon introduces as the intermediate state on the open baryon line a @xmath2-hyperon for which there exists no filled fermi sea .",
    "the so far emerging picture of the nuclear spin - orbit interaction is a rather intriguing one .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling of nucleons in nuclei is predominantly of short - range origin because the long - range @xmath71-exchange components find a mechanism of self - cancellation .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath0-nuclear spin - orbit coupling , on the other hand , reveals the existence of a long - range @xmath71-exchange component of the  wrong sign  .",
    "-isobar excitation . for a nucleon it generates a sizeable three - body spin - orbit force of the  right sign  .",
    "the horizontal double - lines symbolize the filled fermi sea of nucleons .",

    "in summary we have calculated the density dependent @xmath0-nuclear mean - field @xmath37 in the framework of su(3 ) chiral perturbation theory .",

    "the empirical potential depth @xmath149mev is well reproduced with a cut - off scale @xmath150gev , equivalent to a contact interaction , which represents effectively all short - range dynamics not `` resolved '' at scales characteristic of the nuclear fermi momentum .",
