    "the detection of periodic ( 29@xmath0668d ) variations of the 6.7ghz methanol maser emission was an intriguing result from monitoring observations of high - mass young stellar objects ( hmysos ; @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 6.7ghz light curves of 16 periodic sources detected so far ( @xcite ) are quite diverse from sinusoidal like to flaring with the relative amplitude of 0.2@xmath030 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for the few sources mapped so far , the periodic behaviour is seen in individual components of the spectrum arising from a region which is only 20@xmath050per cent of the overall maser structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several models have proposed that the regular and periodic behaviour of the methanol masers are related to variations in the dust temperature or in the seed photon flux .",
    "the temperature of the dust grains can be modulated by ( i ) periodic accretion of material from the circumbinary disc onto a protostar or accretion disc @xcite , ( ii ) rotation of hot and dense material of the spiral shock wave in the central gap of the circumbinary accretion disc @xcite or ( iii ) pulsation of a hmyso @xcite .",
    "the flux of seed photons can be periodically enhanced in ( i ) a colliding - wind binary @xcite or ( ii ) an eclipsing binary @xcite .    since there is no clear observational evidence to support any of these scenarios",
    "we have undertaken a search for a hmyso that shows periodic variations in the 6.7ghz methanol and 22ghz water maser lines .",
    "theoretical models suggest that the density and temperature regimes in which these maser pumps operate do not overlap ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , there is observational evidence for velocity and position coincidence of individual features of both masers in a few sources ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pumping of 6.7ghz methanol masers is dominated by radiative excitation , whereas that of 22ghz water masers depends on collisions with molecular hydrogen ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    ", we announce the discovery of anti - correlated variations of the 6.7ghz and 22ghz masers towards g107.298 + 5.639 ( g107 hereafter ) .",
    "the source is located in the l1204/s140 molecular region which contains the dark nebula and two regions .",
    "it is a deeply embedded object driving a quadrupolar outflow , classified as an intermediate - mass protostar of 370l@xmath1 ( @xcite ) at the distance of 760pc ( @xcite ) . recently ,",
    "a periodic ( 34.6d ) flaring of the 6.7 ghz methanol maser has been reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations presented here are part of the ongoing maser monitoring programme of hmyso with the torun 32-m radio telescope @xcite .",
    "g107 was monitored in the 6.7ghz methanol and 22ghz water lines from 2014 july to 2015 december and from 2015 july to 2015 december , respectively .",
    "the methanol observations were usually once per day but increased to approximately eight times per day during flares and decreased to once per week during quiescent intervals with two gaps of 8 and 16d due to schedule constraints .",
    "the water observations were usually once per day with eight gaps of 4@xmath05d .",
    "the observational setup for the methanol transition observation was the same as reported in @xcite and resulted in a spectral resolution of 0.09 with a typical rms noise level of 0.35jy before 2015 may and then 0.22jy .",
    "the methanol flux density calibration was accurate to less than 10per cent .",
    "the half - power beam width of the 32-m telescope at 22ghz is 1.7arcmin .",
    "we used two 4096-channel correlator parts with 8mhz bandwidth each , which provided a velocity coverage from @xmath046 to 8 with respect to the local standard of rest and a resolution of 0.05 .",
    "the system temperature was from 50 to 250k depending on weather conditions and elevation and the typical rms noise level was 15@xmath020mk .",
    "the data were calibrated by the chopper wheel method and the temperature scale of the spectra was @xmath2 scale derived with an accuracy of about 30per cent .",
    "the target was observed at 6.7ghz with the european vlbi network ( evn ) on 2015 march 16 and usable data were obtained with the following antennas : jodrell bank , effelsberg , medicina , onsala , torun , westerbork and yebes .",
    "a phase - referencing scheme was applied using j2223 + 6249 as phase - calibrator with a switching cycle of 195s+105s ( maser + phase - calibrator ) .",
    "the target was observed for a total of 4.9h .",
    "the bandwidth was set to 4mhz yielding 180 velocity coverage .",
    "data were correlated with 0.25s integration time and 2048 spectral channels yielding a spectral resolution of 0.09 .",
    "the data reduction followed standard procedures for calibration of spectral line observations ( e.g. @xcite ) , using the aips package .",
    "the source 3c454.3 was used as a delay , rate , and bandpass calibrator .",
    "the phase calibrator was imaged and a flux density of 147mjy was obtained .",
    "self - calibration was performed on the strongest maser component and the solutions were applied to the spectral line data .",
    "the images have a typical clean beam at full width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 5.78@xmath33.68mas ( pa = @xmath0782 ) and an rms noise level of 1@xmath01.5mjybeam@xmath4 in emission free channels .",
    "the total astrometric uncertainty of the maser components was about 3mas according to a procedure reported in @xcite .",
    "[ fig - dyn_spectra ] shows the times series of the 6.7 and 22ghz maser spectra .",
    "four 6.7ghz features in the velocity range from @xmath011.1 to @xmath07.0 were detected in all 14 cycles , whereas a faint ( @xmath53.5jy ) emission of 2@xmath04 features at velocities from @xmath017.2 to @xmath013.6 was visible only in some cycles .",
    "we verified the periodicity using the lomb - scargle periodogram ( @xcite ) .",
    "a clear peak at 34.4@xmath60.8d is present in the periodograms of the features @xmath07.4 , @xmath08.6 and @xmath09.2 .",
    "this periodicity is quite consistent with that reported in @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the methanol line was extremely variable ; the relative amplitude of the strongest feature at @xmath07.4 reached 120 . here",
    ", the relative amplitude is defined as ( @xmath7)/@xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath8 are the maximum and minimum flux densities , respectively .",
    "the methanol emission was visible over 4@xmath012d depending on the flux density of flare peak .",
    "the flare curve was almost symmetric , i.e. the ratio of the rise time to the decay time ( @xmath10 ) was about 0.93@xmath60.25 for most features with the exception of the @xmath08.6 feature for which @xmath10=0.59@xmath60.17 .",
    "the average time delays of the maximum flux relative the reference feature of @xmath08.6 are 1.7@xmath60.4 , 1.3@xmath60.3 and 3.4@xmath60.6d for the features at @xmath07.4 , @xmath09.2 and @xmath011.0 , respectively .",

    "the water emission ranged from @xmath018.3 to @xmath01.1 with complex variations in the intensity of all six features .",
    "the emission of the features near @xmath016.5 and @xmath08.0 significantly dimmed or even disappeared at regular intervals just when the methanol emission flares peaked at velocities that differ by less than 1.1 ( figs [ fig - dyn_spectra ] and [ fig - spectra ] ) .",

    "it is noteworthy that faint ( 0.2@xmath00.25k ) or moderate ( 0.4@xmath00.8k ) water maser flares near @xmath01.7 , @xmath012.2 , @xmath013.0 and @xmath013.9 , seen in one or two cycles , peaked only at @xmath120.5 phase separation from the methanol flares ( fig .",

    "the relative amplitude of strong water features was up to 40 .",
    "the values of @xmath10 varied in the range of 1.05 to 1.95 from cycle to cycle and no flare curve was observed with @xmath13 .",
    "the strongest water maser feature near @xmath016.7 drifted in radial velocity by 0.6 over 2 months ( fig .",
    "[ fig - dyn_spectra ] ) .",
    "as the systemic velocity is @xmath011.3 ( @xcite ) this drift can be interpreted as an effect of gas deceleration at the interface between an accelerated outflow and the molecular environment of hmyso .",
    "the results of the evn observation are summarised in table [ clouds ] which lists the following parameters of the methanol maser clouds with gaussian velocity profiles : relative coordinates , peak velocity ( @xmath14 ) , line width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) and flux density ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the term of cloud is defined as in @xcite .",
    "the 13 methanol maser clouds detected in g107 are mainly grouped in two clusters separated by @xmath12400mas in the south - east ( se)@xmath0north - west ( nw ) direction ( fig . [ fig - map ] ) .",
    "the higher velocity emission ( @xmath169.5 ) , i.e. redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity is distributed within the se cluster ( clouds _ 1@xmath09 _ ) of size 140@xmath370mas . the peak brightness temperature ( @xmath17 ) of maser components in this cluster ranges from @xmath18k to @xmath19k .",
    "weak emission ( clouds _ 11@xmath013 _ ) at lower velocity ( @xmath2015.8 ) from the nw cluster has an arc - like morphology of about 70mas in extent .",
    "their components have @xmath21k .",
    "both maser clusters containing a total of 12 clouds are oriented along an axis of position angle of @xmath043 that agrees perfectly with the position angle of the major axis of large - scale ( @xmath1220 ) outflow b traced by co lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "the isolated methanol cloud _ 10 _ near @xmath011.0 is located @xmath12360mas westward from the se cluster and its @xmath17 is @xmath22k .",
    "it lies very close to the axis of outflow a seen in co lines ( @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - map ] the map of methanol maser clouds is superimposed on the 22ghz water maser distribution observed from 2006 november to 2007 december with vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) by @xcite ( their tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the position of the 1.3 mm continuum emission is showed with error bars ( @xcite ) and the directions of molecular outflows ( @xcite ) are marked .",
    "the water masers in g107 are distributed in four clusters from a roughly circular region of size @xmath12300mas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the southern cluster of water emission with velocities from @xmath08.8 to @xmath08.2 lies 95mas north to @xmath08.6 methanol emission ( cloud _ 6 _ in table [ clouds ] ) .",
    "their intensities vary in opposite way ( fig .",
    "[ fig - light_curves ] ) .",
    "the water masers in the velocity range from @xmath018.1 to @xmath016.4 detected in the western cluster of arc - like shape are displaced by only 30mas from the methanol maser arc - like structure at velocities from @xmath016.7 to @xmath016.1 ( clouds _ 11@xmath013 _ in table [ clouds ] ) .",
    "we note that the astrometric uncertainties of water and methanol maser positions are 0.1mas and 3mas , respectively , so that part of this displacement can be affected by a proper motion because we compare the data sets at two epochs spanned 8yr .",
    "simultaneous observations of both lines at high angular resolution will be needed to be more definitive .",
    "we preliminary conclude that these water and methanol masers coincide within 20au for the assumed distance of 764pc and exhibit alternating flares .",
    "the region of co - existence of the two masers is located 140pc away from the central source of infrared emission .",
    "the water emission at velocities from @xmath03.6 to @xmath03.2 from the western compact ( @xmath2330mas ) cluster was not detected during our monitoring .",
    "three features of water maser at velocities from @xmath014.3 to @xmath09.7 , which appeared in two cycles may come from the nw elongated ( @xmath12120mas ) cluster imaged by @xcite .",
    "our monitoring observations provided the first evidence that g107 alternates cyclically between the 6.7ghz methanol maser emission state and the 22ghz water maser state with a period of 34.4d .",
    "the detectable methanol emission lasts only about 20 per cent of the period when the water emission drops below the detection level .",
    "the periodic features of both maser lines of g107 coincide within less that 1.1 and at least some clouds of both maser species are in the same volume of molecular gas of size 30@xmath080au .",
    "similarly , the co - existence of features of both masers in regions of size 100@xmath0300au is seen for a few objects ( e.g. @xcite , a few spots of cluster c in their fig .",
    "3 ; @xcite ) albeit many interferometric observations demonstrated that the methanol and water masers arise from different parts of the hmyso environments .",
    "it is generally accepted that the 22ghz water transition is collisionally pumped in the cooling post - shock gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the 6.7ghz methanol transition is pumped by mid - infrared photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 22ghz transition is inverted over a broad range of physical conditions with a kinetic temperature ( @xmath24 ) from 200 to 2000k , number density of @xmath25 to @xmath19@xmath26 and fractional abundance higher than @xmath27 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 22ghz maser gain weakly depends on dust temperature ( @xmath28 ) lower than 100k , but it is reduced by an order of magnitude for @xmath28 = 300k and the pumping is most efficient when @xmath29t@xmath30 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently published models confirm this trend ; the lowest inversion of the 22ghz transition occurs for @xmath31 500k ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 6.7ghz maser transition is radiatively pumped over a broad range of the number density ( @xmath32@xmath26 ) at methanol fractional abundance greater than @xmath33 .",
    "the brightness temperature increases rapidly for @xmath28 about 120k and then is nearly constant up to @xmath28=500k ( @xcite ) .",
    "it slightly drops with the gas temperature increase from 30 to 250k .",
    "the 6.7ghz emission diminishes when @xmath24 approaches or exceeds @xmath28 .",
    "it is apparent from the above modelled ranges of the physical parameters that the 6.7ghz methanol and 22ghz water masers can co - exist in the same regions of g107 for a narrow range of gas density of @xmath34@xmath26 and kinetic temperature of @xmath35k .",
    "note that this upper limit of @xmath24 is poorly set as higher values were not investigated .",
    "however , one expects that for higher @xmath24 , the rotational levels are quickly thermalized and the methanol maser is quenched .",
    "no mechanism is known which produces changes of gas density and methanol abundance by an order of magnitude over a region of size 300au on time - scales of 1 week .",
    "it seems that only the dust temperature can react sufficiently fast to the variations of the central object radiation and controls the methanol and water maser intensities . since the pumping processes are competitive , a pulse of the strong infrared radiation quenches collisionally pumped 22ghz water transition and enhances the radiatively pumped 6.7ghz methanol transition .",
    "previous observations of g107 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that the masers are excited by a deeply embedded young stellar object of about 4@xmath05m@xmath1 and a bolometric luminosity of 370l@xmath1 .",
    "this newly born star drives a quadrupolar outflow of dynamical age of about 1200yr and a faint ultracompact region ( @xmath360.01pc ) with characteristics typical for a class 0 protostar of spectral type b3 .",
    "the emission of complex molecules probably traces a rotating disc of size @xmath12300au .",
    "the gas temperature derived from the thermal methanol lines is about 100@xmath0150k .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the observed maser flares follow the luminosity variations of hmysos which are pulsationally unstable when growing under rapid mass accretion with rates @xmath37m@xmath1yr@xmath4 . for the observed period of 34.4d",
    "their models give a luminosity 40 times higher than that inferred from observations of g107 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we conclude that this mechanism is an unlikely explanation for the periodic maser behaviour .",
    "there is a growing number of embedded class 0 protostars only detectable at infrared wavelengths in which the cyclic variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) can be related to accretion instabilities developed by interactions between the stellar magnetosphere and the accretion disc ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the episodic changes in luminosity on time - scales of a few years , this mechanism could invoke short period ( @xmath1230d ) modulations with amplitude of 1@xmath02mag .",
    "for instance an embedded outflow source irs7 in the l1634 molecular cloud shows periodic flares with a period of @xmath1237d and amplitude of about 2 mag in the @xmath38 band ( @xcite ) .",
    "it spends about half the period in a quiescent state that is comparable to that observed in the archetypal periodic source g9.62 + 0.20e ( @xcite ) but is much shorter than in g107 .",
    "nevertheless this scenario can be viable because in addition to a well defined periodicity in g107 we observed significant modulations of the maser emission peaks which can be induced by accretion rate variations on longer time - scales .",
    "@xcite have postulated that the maser gain follows the periodic accretion instabilities induced in a protobinary system .",
    "this mechanism of binary orbit triggered accretion rate ( @xcite ) modelled for the 6.7ghz maser line by @xcite predicts that the illumination of the disc by the bow shock hot material led to the variation of the dust temperature in the disc and regulates the maser brightness with the orbital phase .",
    "the detailed results of this modelling are questioned ( @xcite ) but this scenario may be an alternative explanation of the maser behaviour in g107 . using the theoretical values from @xcite we found the observed 6.7ghz flare curve similar to the accretion rate curve for a 4 and 3m@xmath1 binary with eccentricity of 0.6 , a period of 0.09yr and a semi - major axis of 0.4au .",
    "therefore , it seems that the orbital characteristics of a hypothetical binary system in g107 may be similar to those suggested for short ( 29.5d ) period source g12.89 + 0.49 ( @xcite ) and very different from longer ( @xmath39200d ) period masers such as g9.62 + 0.20e ( @xcite ) .",
    "high angular resolution data of g107 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) do not provide evidence for such a binary ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    our observations do not support the hypothesis that the maser flares in g107 are due to variations in the free - free background seed photon flux produced by a colliding - wind binary ( @xcite ) or an eclipsing binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "changes in the continuum emission of the ultracompact with a spectral index of @xmath400.5 ( @xcite ) should result in correlated variations of the water and methanol maser intensities .",
    "we thank the torun cfa staff and the students for assistance with the observations .",
    "we are grateful to eric gerard for reading and useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad data base , operated at cds ( strasbourg , france ) and nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services ."
