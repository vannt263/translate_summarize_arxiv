    "when one takes into account the gravity and quantum theory issues in the special relativity , the general theory of relativity and quantum field theory can be achieved respectively .",
    "however , the need for a quantum theory of gravity is inevitable either in general relativity to resolve the space - time singularities or in quantum field theories to overcome the ultraviolet divergencies .",
    "evidently , both of these problems have the same origin and may be resolved by taking an effective cutoff on ultraviolet , i.e. , a minimal observable length scale ( for singularity resolution in general relativity see @xcite and for the ultraviolet regularization of the quantum field theory see @xcite ) .",
    "this issue is also proposed by the quantum gravity candidates such as loop quantum gravity @xcite and string theory @xcite which both of them suggest some modifications to the structure of the standard quantum mechanics . from string theory point of view , a minimum length scale @xmath0 which is responsible for the strings size @xcite ,",
    "will appear due to the corrections to the standard uncertainty principle .",
    "such generalized uncertainty relations can also be realized from a noncanonical ( deformed ) heisenberg algebra on the corresponding hilbert space @xcite .",
    "noncommutativity between space - time coordinates was first introduced by snyder in 1947 @xcite , which was a lorentz invariant theory with a minimal length scale in its formalism .",
    "the associated noncanonical heisenberg algebra is also very similar to the one obtained in the context of the string theory @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", another formalism of quantum mechanics , called polymer quantum mechanics , is proposed which supports the idea of the existence of a minimal length scale @xmath1 , known as the polymer length , without any attribution to the noncanonical heisenberg algebra @xcite . in this approach for quantization of a given dynamical system",
    "one uses methods very similar to the effective models of loop quantum gravity . here",
    ", the main role is played by the mentioned polymer length scale in such a way that , unlike the deformed algebraic structure usually coming from the noncommutative phase - space variables , it enters into the hamiltonian of the system to deform its functional form into a new one called the polymeric hamiltonian . however",
    ", a question may be raised : can a polymer - deformed quantum mechanical theory be compatible with a theory with noncanonical ( deformed ) heisenberg algebra in its formalism ? in this paper we are going to answer this question by concentrating on the noncanonical hilbert space representation of the polymer quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , we show that the noncanonical representation of the polymer quantum mechanics coincides with an snyder - deformed ( noncanonical ) heisenberg algebra just by reasonable identification of the deformation parameters as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the planck length .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , general formulation of the polymer quantization is briefly reviewed .",
    "the standard canonical representation of the polymer quantum mechanics is presented in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the noncanonical representation of the polymer quantum mechanics is investigated and the corresponding hilbert space representation is also studied .",
    "the generalized uncertainty principle is obtained in this setup and the simple harmonic oscillator is considered as a relevant example . in section 5 , inspired by the theory of snyder noncommutative spaces ,",
    "we first construct a noncanonical heisenberg algebra and then show that it can be identified with the polymer - modified heisenberg algebra obtained from the noncanonical polymeric representation .",
    "the classical limits of the canonical and noncanonical polymeric representation is the subject of section 6 in which it is shown that these two setups are related to each other just by a darboux transformation on the associated phase space .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the summary and conclusions .",
    "polymer quantum mechanics is an alternative framework of the commutation relation that is investigated in the context of the loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard schrdinger picture , this representation gives an ultraviolet cutoff due to the existence of the polymer length as a possible minimum length scale for the system under consideration . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the kinematics and dynamics of the polymer quantum mechanics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .      consider a classical mechanical system consisting of a single particle which is characterized by the position @xmath4 and its conjugate momentum @xmath5 ( we will use the notation @xmath6 for the classical variables through this paper ) . in the two - dimensional phase space @xmath7 ,",
    "these quantities satisfy the ordinary canonical poisson algebra @xmath8 canonical quantization is straightforward .",
    "classical variables @xmath7 are replaced by quantum operators @xmath9 and the role of the poisson brackets will be played by the dirac commutators .",
    "then one is led to the quantum heisenberg algebra @xmath10=i\\,,\\ ] ] in which we have set @xmath11 .",
    "the operators @xmath9 are unbounded and the associated hilbert space should necessarily be infinite - dimensional . however , in quantum gravity regime in order to take the natural cutoffs such as minimal length and maximal momentum into account , one deals with bounded variables .",
    "one way to out of this difficulty is implementing the weyl algebra @xcite .",
    "thus , in an alternative way , but more admissible for the polymer representation , one can adopt the complex exponential versions of the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( weyl operators ) as @xmath14 with @xmath15 the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath16 have dimensions of momentum and length respectively . using the baker - hausdorff lemma , the heisenberg algebra ( [ ccr ] ) for the operators",
    "@xmath9 takes the following weyl algebra form @xmath17 generated by the exponentiated position and momentum operators ( [ exp - op ] ) .",
    "then , the ordinary schrdinger representation can be obtained via the standard gelfand - naimark - segal construction @xcite . in position polarization of the schrdinger representation ,",
    "the corresponding hilbert space is @xmath18 which is the space of the square integrable functions with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath19 on the real line @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space in the momentum polarization will be @xmath21 in which the operators are represented as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a typical wave function . according to the stone - von neumann uniqueness theorem every irreducible representation of the weyl algebra ( [ weyl - a ] ) which is weakly continuous in the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath16 , is unitarily equivalent to the standard schrdinger representation .",
    "but , the so - called polymer representation is unitarily inequivalent to the schrdinger one @xcite .",
    "evidently , the construction should violates at least one assumption of the stone - von neumann uniqueness theorem .",
    "indeed , the exponentiated momentum operator @xmath24 is no longer weakly continuous in @xmath16 in the polymer representation . taking this hypothesis into account",
    ", the polymer representation can be obtained from the the weyl algebra ( [ weyl - a ] ) via the gelfand - naimark - segal construction @xcite .    in this regard , we define an abstract ket @xmath25 , labeled by a real number @xmath26 , which shall belong to the non - separable hilbert space @xmath27 . an appropriate state can be obtained by taking a linear combination of a finite collections of vectors @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31 one can work in position or momentum polarization . in momentum polarization ,",
    "the states are denoted by @xmath32 where @xmath33 since here the operator @xmath24 , is not weakly continuous in @xmath16 , the associated momentum operator @xmath13 does not exist .",
    "however , @xmath24 itself is a well - defined operator which acts on the states ( [ pstate ] ) as @xmath34 on the other hand the operator @xmath12 is well - defined in the sense that the corresponding exponential operator @xmath35 is continuous in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath12 can be identified as @xmath36 which can be interpreted as a discrete operator in the sense that its eigenvalues are labeled by @xmath26s which in turn , may take their values from a continuum such that the states ( [ pstate ] ) are orthonormal .",
    "now , what remains is the definition of an inner product with respect to an appropriate measure on the abstract hilbert space @xmath37 .",
    "the above definitions correspond to the bohr compactification of the real line @xmath38 which is a compact group , and the haar measure @xmath39 is a natural measure defined on it .",
    "therefore , the polymeric hilbert space @xmath37 in momentum polarization will be @xcite @xmath40 therefore , one may define the following inner product for the periodic functions @xmath41 on this hilbert space , @xmath42 in contrast to the standard schrdinger representation , the dirac delta function is replaced by the kronecker delta in this setup .",
    "our starting point in this section is to consider a classical hamiltonian function and see how one can passes from this point to the polymeric hamiltonian . to do this ,",
    "let us begin with the classical nonrelativistic hamiltonian function @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a mass parameter and @xmath45 denotes a potential function . at classical level ,",
    "the pair @xmath46 satisfy the poisson algebra ( [ cpa ] ) and at quantum level , they should be replaced with their operator counterpart @xmath9 and the standard heisenberg algebra ( [ ccr ] ) .",
    "both of the position @xmath12 and momentum @xmath13 are well - defined operators in the standard schrdinger representation since their exponentiated operators @xmath35 and @xmath24 are weakly continuous in @xmath0 and @xmath16 respectively . in momentum polarization , the position and momentum operators are given by the relations ( [ mhs ] ) on the hilbert space ( [ hs ] ) . in polymer representation , however , this argument fails to be applicable since the exponentiated momentum operator @xmath24 is no longer weakly continuous in @xmath16 and consequently the corresponding momentum operator does not exist .",
    "the main task now is to define a suitable momentum operator and its square in polymer framework to achieve a quantum hamiltonian operator from the classical version ( [ nhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the situation is very similar to that in loop quantum gravity , where while the connection is not a well - defined operator , its holonomy is and plays the role of the con- jugate momentum for the volume operator with discrete eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "the standard prescription is to define the lattice @xmath47 on the configuration space as @xmath48 which ensures the self - adjointness of the position operator and also discreteness of its eigenvalues . in order to regulate a momentum operator in this setup",
    ", we consider the action of its exponentiated operator @xmath49 on the basic kets as @xmath50 the physical states in the separable hilbert space @xmath51 are then of the form @xmath52 satisfy @xmath53 . in this respect",
    ", one can regulate the momentum operator in polymer framework by means of the exponential shift operator as @xcite @xmath54 the squared momentum operator can be defined in the same way just by twice acting the polymeric momentum operator ( [ plmo ] ) on the states as shifts the states two steps in the lattice to both sides .",
    "however , one can rescale this operator as @xmath55 to give an approximation for the squared momentum operator that shifts the states one step in lattice @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath56 then , the quantum polymeric hamiltonian operator can be deduced by means of the polymeric squared momentum operator ( [ plmo2 ] ) from the classical hamiltonian function ( [ nhamiltonian ] ) as @xmath57 evidently , the momentum is periodic in the sense that the functions of @xmath13 that preserve the lattice @xmath58 are of the form @xmath59 for integer @xmath44 .",
    "there is a maximal value for the momentum which is defined by the lattice spacing @xmath1 .",
    "thus the momentum operator is bounded self - adjoint operator on the lattice . in classical regime",
    ", it means that the momentum part of the phase space is compactified to a circle @xmath60 ( see the section for the classical phase space ) .",
    "thus , the separable hilbert space @xmath61 in momentum polarization will be @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is now the haar measure for @xmath60 .",
    "this hilbert space is a subspace of the nonseparable polymeric hilbert space ( [ phs ] ) .",
    "one can also define the momentum operator and its square on the nonseparable hilbert space @xmath64 , but their physical interpretation is problematic @xcite .",
    "for instance , as we will see , the position eigenvectors are orthonormal only when one considers the lattice ( [ lattice ] ) on the separable hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) .    like the standard schrdinger representation",
    ", one can solve the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem in position or momentum polarization in polymer setup .",
    "but , we prefer to work in momentum polarization in this paper .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem @xmath65 takes the form of a difference equation for the fourier coefficient of a general state @xmath66 in position polarization and it becomes a differential equation when it acts on the state ( [ pls ] ) in momentum polarization of the hilbert space @xmath51 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "using definition ( [ exp - op ] ) for the shift operator @xmath67 in the relation ( [ plmo ] ) , gives an approximation for the polymeric momentum as @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "note also that this relation implies a bounded range for the polymeric momentum as @xmath70 . in the limit of @xmath71 , the polymeric momentum operator @xmath72 coincides with its standard unbounded canonical one @xmath73 .",
    "this result shows that the compactification of the momentum by the circle @xmath60 induces an ultraviolet cutoff defined by the lattice spacing . in the same way",
    ", the polymeric hamiltonian operator ( [ qh ] ) can be approximated as @xmath74 interestingly , this hamiltonian gives both the maximal momentum and also maximal energy for the case of a free particle @xcite .",
    "note that one can represent the separable polymeric hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) with either of the pairs @xmath9 and @xmath75 on the lattice ( [ lattice ] ) .",

    "the position and momentum act as a derivative and multiplication operators respectively @xmath76 also , corresponding hilbert space is nothing but ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) with uniform measure @xmath77 therefore , the inner product for the periodic functions @xmath78 on the hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 ] ) can be obtained via the definition ( [ phs - ip ] ) as @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",

    "as we have mentioned above , one may also work with the pair @xmath75 on the separable hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) .",
    "we note that while the canonical momentum @xmath13 satisfies the canonical heisenberg algebra ( [ ccr ] ) , it is easy to show that the polymeric momentum @xmath86 satisfies the noncanonical ( deformed ) heisenberg algebra @xmath87=i\\sqrt{1-(\\mu p_\\mu)^2}\\,.\\ ] ] because of this , we call the components of the pair @xmath75 as the noncanonical operators .",
    "it is important to note that the relation ( [ cr - pl ] ) would be only considered on the lattice to ensure the self - adjointness of the position and momentum operators .",
    "nevertheless , we consider this issue in more details to compare the results with the case of the snyder noncommutative space in the next section . in the noncanonical representation",
    "the hamiltonian operator takes the standard functional form @xmath88 thus , one may work within two equivalent pictures on the separable hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) : _ i _ ) working with the standard canonical momentum @xmath13 which satisfies the standard heisenberg algebra ( [ ccr ] ) together with the polymer - modified hamiltonian operator ( [ qhamiltonian ] ) .",

    "the latter , however , is the noncanonical polymeric representation of quantum mechanics which we are going to consider its hilbert space representation in this paper .",
    "clearly , this hilbert space is unitarily equivalent to the hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 ] ) .",
    "this is because they may be considered as the different faces of the separable hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) and consequently all the physical results should be the same . nevertheless , as we will show",
    ", the noncanonical representation would be interesting due to its possible connection with the theories based on the noncommutative heisenberg algebra such as the generalized uncertainty relations suggested by string theory @xcite . also , the noncanonical representation is more admissible from the statistical point of view when the polymer quantization is applied to the thermodynamical systems @xcite .    in momentum polarization ,",
    "the position and the polymeric momentum operators act on the physical states as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 is given by ( [ pls ] ) .",

    "@xcite for details ) @xmath118 ) does not predict any minimal uncertainty in position measurement . here , the existence of a minimal length ( the polymer length scale @xmath1 ) is encoded in the discrete position eigenvalues rather than the minimal uncertainty in position measurement .",
    "the advantage of this viewpoint to the minimal length becomes more clear when we note that one can work either in position or in momentum polarization in polymer framework .",

    "evidently , the momentum is bounded as @xmath161 if @xmath162 while a minimum nonzero uncertainty in position as @xmath163 can be realized in the case of @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "the former one is very similar to the noncanonical polymeric representation with deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ cr - pl ] ) and we only consider this case in this paper .",
    "the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ s - pnca ] ) together with the associated hamiltonian operator @xmath165 complete our construction to study the kinematics and dynamics of the physical system in this setup .",
    "however , one should be careful that while the hamiltonian operator ( [ s - hamiltonian ] ) has the standard functional form , the associated momentum is bounded as @xmath166 .      comparing the commutation relation ( [ cr - pl ] ) with the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ s - pnca ] ) ,",
    "one immediately recognizes a correspondence between momenta @xmath86 and @xmath145 , they satisfy the same modified heisenberg algebra and also they are bounded in the same way by the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "thus , we identify the polymeric momentum @xmath72 with @xmath145 as @xmath167 in which we have also set the reasonable identification @xmath168 for the deformation parameters .",
    "it is however important to note that the polymer length @xmath1 is the lattice parameter and does not have to always be very small although we consider it to be small compared to other length scales present in the system under consideration .",
    "we have done such assumption before in the study of harmonic oscillator where we considered @xmath1 to be very small in comparison with the natural length scale @xmath169 . on the other hand , in the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ s - pnca ] ) , the length scale @xmath0",
    "is always assumed to be very small ( for instance of order of the planck length ) to induce a cutoff in ultraviolet regime @xcite .",
    "thus , we suppose that the identification ( [ i d ] ) is possible for sufficiently small values of the polymer length scale @xmath1 . here",
    ", we consider @xmath170 through the paper , where the numerical coefficient @xmath171 should be fixed by experiment @xcite .",
    "then , both of the polymer quantum mechanics and the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ s - pnca ] ) can induce a maximal value for the momentum around the planck momentum @xmath172 up to the numerical factor @xmath171 .",
    "there is also another point here , that is , the polymer variables are restricted to belong to the lattice ( [ lattice ] ) while there is no such restriction when dealing with the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ s - pnca ] ) . however , as an extra structure , one may define a lattice also for the snyder - deformed case in order to get a self - adjoint position operator with orthogonal eigenvectors @xcite . in this respect , as we will show , the position eigenvectors become naturally orthogonal in the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra when it identifies with the noncanonical polymeric representation of the quantum mechanics .    as we say before , the eigenvalue problem of the harmonic oscillator in the snyder - deformed framework , gives the same result that we have already obtained in the pervious section in the noncanonical polymeric representation @xcite .",
    "but , the inner product of the position eigenstates ( [ pevp - s ] ) are no longer generally orthogonal .",
    "indeed , we have @xcite @xmath173 and there is no reason to suppose @xmath174 in this setup ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "however , one can define a family of orthogonal eigenvectors that make the position operator diagonal @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to considering a lattice such as ( [ lattice ] ) for the position operator .",
    "thus , the identification ( [ i d ] ) is reliable when one considers a lattice for the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra on a separable hilbert space being isomorphic to ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) .",
    "+ 12em @xmath175 versus @xmath176 is plotted , where @xmath177 denotes the position eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath26 in the snyder - deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ s - pnca ] ) framework .",
    "the figure shows that these eigenvectors are no longer orthogonal ( see relation ( [ snyd - evp ] ) ) .",
    "but , there is a family of orthogonal eigenvectors for @xmath178 .",
    "existence of this family of orthogonal eigenvectors indicates that one should consider a lattice ( such as ( [ lattice ] ) which is implemented in the polymer framework ) to preserve the orthogonality of the position eigenvectors .",
    "the figure is plotted for @xmath179.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]",
    "now , let us study the classical limit of the polymer quantum mechanics which leads to a one - parameter family of @xmath1-dependent classical theory rather than the ordinary classical one .",
    "the standard classical theory would be recovered from the discrete @xmath1-dependent one in the continuum limit @xmath103 .",
    "however , one can also study such effective @xmath1-dependent theories without any attribution to the quantum one by means of a process known as _",
    "polymerization _ in the literatures @xcite .",
    "the method is based on implementing the weyl operator on the classical phase space in order to define an appropriate definition for the discrete derivative of the phase space functions @xcite .",
    "however , here , we should study the classical limit of the polymer quantum mechanics which we have considered in the pervious sections .",
    "more precisely , we analyze the classical phase space corresponds to the hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) in two different pictures , i.e. , in canonical and noncanonical pictures correspond to the hilbert spaces ( [ hs - s1 ] ) and ( [ snyd - hs ] ) , respectively . in this regard",
    ", the momentum part of the phase space should be compactified as a circle @xmath60 and the configuration space is the real line @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we consider a two - dimensional symplectic space @xmath180 with topology @xmath181 as the polymeric phase space corresponds to the hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 m ] ) and study its classical implications for two canonical and noncanonical cases .",
    "let us start with the noncanonical representation of the polymeric phase space @xmath182 and deal with the classical variables @xmath183 correspond to the operators @xmath75 , which are expected to satisfy the following poisson bracket @xmath184 the associated classical hamiltonian function can easily be deduced from the corresponding hamiltonian operator ( [ s - hamiltonian ] ) as @xmath185 the poisson algebra ( [ nc - pa ] ) together with the hamiltonian function ( [ nc - hamiltonian ] ) determine the kinematics and dynamics of the system on the polymeric phase space @xmath182 .",
    "nevertheless , we implement the symplectic geometry in order to define the associated hamiltonian system which , as we will see , gives a more clear connection between classical and quantum frameworks for the polymeric systems .",
    "consider a symplectic manifold thought as the phase space @xmath182 equipped with a symplectic structure @xmath186 which is a closed nondegenerate @xmath187-form on @xmath180 .",
    "we propose the symplectic @xmath187-form being the noncanonical form @xmath188 in this chart @xcite .",
    "the reason for this proposition will become clear when we show that the symplectic structure ( [ nc - structure ] ) correctly generates the noncanonical poisson algebra ( [ nc - pa ] ) . the hamiltonian triplet is defined as @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the hamiltonian vector field which determines the time evolution of the system through the equation @xmath191 substituting the symplectic structure ( [ nc - structure ] ) and the associated hamiltonian function ( [ nc - hamiltonian ] ) into the equation ( [ vf - d ] ) gives the solution for the vector field as @xmath192 the integral curves of the vector field @xmath190 , in turn , give the hamilton s equation in this chart @xmath193 which will be reduced to the standard hamiltonian equations in the limit @xmath194 .",
    "the poisson bracket between two real valued functions @xmath195 and @xmath196 on the phase space @xmath180 is defined as @xmath197 and closure of the symplectic structure ensures that the jacobi identity is satisfied by the resultant poisson brackets . with the help of the relations ( [ nc - structure ] ) and ( [ nc - vf ] ) ,",
    "the definition ( [ pb ] ) gives the poisson brackets in this chart as @xmath198 it is straightforward to check that the noncanonical poisson algebra can be retrieved from the relation ( [ nc - pb ] ) by substituting @xmath199 and @xmath200 which shows that the symplectic structure ( [ nc - structure ] ) is chosen correctly .      according to the darboux theorem , it is always possible to find a local chart in which any symplectic structure takes the canonical form .",
    "thus , there is a ( darboux ) transformation from the noncanonical pair of variables @xmath201 to a canonical one @xmath7 in which the symplectic @xmath187-form ( [ nc - structure ] ) takes the canonical form .    to see how this statement may work , consider the following darboux transformation on the phase space @xmath180 @xmath202 which locally transforms the symplectic structure ( [ nc - structure ] ) to the canonical form @xmath203 and also transforms the hamiltonian function ( [ nc - hamiltonian ] ) to @xmath204 this form for the hamiltonian functional is the same as the classical limit of the polymeric hamiltonian operator ( [ qhamiltonian ] ) . substituting the canonical symplectic structure ( [ dar - twoform ] ) and also the associated hamiltonian function ( [ class - hamiltonian ] ) into the equation ( [ vf - d ] ) ,",
    "we are led to the following solution for the hamiltonian vector field @xmath205 the integral curves of the above hamiltonian vector field are the polymer - modified hamilton s equations of motion in the canonical ( darboux ) chart @xmath206 which clearly reduce to the standard hamilton s equations in the continuum limit @xmath103 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the equations ( [ dar - phe ] ) and ( [ nc - he ] ) are in agreement through the darboux transformation ( [ nc - transformation ] ) .",
    "substituting @xmath207 and @xmath208 from ( [ dar - vf ] ) into ( [ pb ] ) one gets @xmath209 which is nothing but the standard definition for the canonical poisson bracket between two arbitrary functions @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "choosing @xmath210 and @xmath211 , we can easily deduce @xmath212 which is coincided with the standard canonical poisson algebra ( [ cpa ] ) .",
    "therefore , one deals with the unique hamiltonian triplet @xmath213 on the polymeric phase space @xmath182 which can be represented in two different local charts : i ) in the non - canonical chart , one can work with symplectic structure ( [ nc - structure ] ) , hamiltonian function ( [ nc - hamiltonian ] ) , and the corresponding noncanonical poisson algebra ( [ nc - pa ] ) .",
    "ii ) we can also work in the canonical chart and utilize the effective hamiltonian function ( [ class - hamiltonian ] ) , the symplectic structure ( [ dar - twoform ] ) and the ordinary canonical poisson algebra ( [ dar - pa ] ) .",
    "the former is the classical limit of the noncanonical polymeric representation on the hilbert space ( [ snyd - hs ] ) and the latter is the classical limit of the canonical representation on the hilbert space ( [ hs - s1 ] ) .",
    "the trajectories on the polymeric phase space @xmath182 are the same in either noncanonical and canonical charts since equation ( [ vf - d ] ) is hold in a chart - independent manner for the hamiltonian system @xmath214 .",
    "existence of a minimal measurable length is a common feature of the quantum gravity candidates such as loop quantum gravity and string theory .",
    "this issue can also be realized from an algebraic deformation in the standard quantum mechanical structures .",
    "the so - called polymer quantum mechanics is investigated in the symmetric sector of the loop quantum gravity which supports the existence of a kind of minimal length scale @xmath1 known as the polymer length . on the other hand ,",
    "the generalized uncertainty relations have been suggested in the context of string theory which also predict a minimal length scale @xmath0 ( corresponds to the strings size ) for the system under consideration .",
    "the minimal length scale is usually taken to be of the order of planck length and consequently either the polymer quantum mechanics or the generalized uncertainty theories induce an ultraviolet cutoff on planck scale , where one expects the quantum gravitational effects significantly would become important .",
    "therefore , we have considered the noncanonical hilbert space representation of the polymer quantum mechanics in order to explore a possible connection between the polymer quantum mechanics and the generalized uncertainty theories .",
    "all the physical result in noncanonical representation , of course , are the same as those obtained in the canonical representation since these representations are unitarily equivalent .",
    "however , the relation with the generalized uncertainty theories immediately emerges since the heisenberg algebra get modified in the noncanonical polymeric representation .",
    "the polymer - modified heisenberg algebra ( [ cr - pl ] ) in the noncanonical representation leads to the polymer - modified uncertainty relation ( [ ur - pl ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the polymer - modified heisenberg algebra ( [ cr - pl ] ) is coincided with the snyder - deformed ( noncommutative ) heisenberg algebra ( [ s - pnca ] ) in which the translation group is not deformed .",
    "technically , however , there is a crucial difference between the polymer quantum mechanics and the generalized uncertainty theories . in polymer framework",
    ", the eigenvalues of the position operator are taken to be discrete with respect to the minimal ( polymer ) length scale @xmath1 . in the generalized uncertainty theories , however",
    ", the minimal length scale is emerged through a nonzero minimal uncertainty in position measurement which forbid the position eigenvectors with zero uncertainty in position .",
    "the position eigenvectors are no longer orthogonal and the position polarization fails to be applicable in this setup . in contrast , the position operator is restricted to belong to the lattice ( [ lattice ] ) in polymer framework and its eigenvectors are generally orthogonal and leave the lattice invariant .",
    "thus , both the position and momentum polarization are relevant ( self - adjoint ) operators in polymer framework .",
    "therefore , the polymer viewpoint to the minimal length scale is more fundamental . at classical level",
    ", the noncanonical representation of the polymer quantum mechanics is determined by the polymer - modified poisson algebra ( [ nc - pa ] ) and the hamiltonian function ( [ nc - hamiltonian ] ) . in the canonical representation",
    ", however , the poisson algebra takes its standard canonical form ( [ dar - pa ] ) , but the corresponding hamiltonian function get modified as ( [ class - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we have shown that these two pictures are determined by the unique hamiltonian system and they are related by a darboux transformation on the corresponding phase space . at the end",
    ", a natural question may arise : does it follow from the comparison to snyder space - time that polymer quantization could be lorentz invariant ? in this sense",
    "we would like to emphasize that since like the standard quantum mechanics , the polymer quantum mechanics is not lorentz invariant , it is just equivalent to the quantum mechanics in snyder noncommutative setup .",
    "however , the snyder noncommutative space - time may be equivalent with polymer quantum field theory .",
