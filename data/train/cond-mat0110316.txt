    "( [ eqn - birpa ] ) at wave - vector @xmath102 and energy @xmath13 , driven by the effective interaction eq .",
    "( [ eqn - effj ] ) in the odd @xmath43 mode .",
    "since @xmath13 is slightly below the threshold @xmath103 to the particle  hole ( ph ) continuum , the resonance appears undamped , i.e. , as a @xmath104-function . due to the inter - layer coupling @xmath105 the interaction eq .",
    "( [ eqn - effj ] ) is weaker in the even @xmath42 mode , and the resonance in @xmath106 is shifted up into the ph - continuum , becoming almost suppressed .",
    "consequently , in wave - vector space a sharp peak around @xmath102 is visible only in the odd @xmath43 mode .",
    "this is demonstrated in the top panel of fig.[fig-2dplots ] .",
    "the bottom panel of that figure shows the magnetic response at a higher energy close to the hump - maxima @xmath93 .",
    "the intensity is much reduced compared to the resonance . however , the magnetic excitations at @xmath107 occupy almost the whole 2d brillouin zone , and despite their small amplitude they contribute to the wave vector integrated susceptibility eq .",
    "( [ eqn - chi2d ] ) .",
    "the ` hump ' can be traced back to ph - excitations across the maximum gap @xmath9 : at @xmath90 the irreducible particle ",

    "this is shown in the inset of fig.[fig - chi2d ] .",
    "when the final - state interaction eq.([eqn - effj ] ) is taken into account , the resonance is obtained in the odd mode , and the hump is pulled down to @xmath112 .",
    "also is the doping dependence of @xmath9 compensated : @xmath93 are independent of doping , while @xmath9 increases with underdoping .",
    "two experimental groups studied the wave - vector integrated magnetic response @xmath113 in underdoped ybco . refs . reported a line shape for ybco@xmath114 , which agrees quite well with our theoretical result for @xmath115 .",
    "a ` hump ' in @xmath116 ( even ) appears at @xmath117mev , @xmath118 ( odd ) shows a similar structure at a somewhat lower energy @xmath119mev .",
    "the well - known resonance appears only in @xmath118 at @xmath120mev . in refs .",
    "two underdoped samples ybco@xmath121 and ybco@xmath122 have been studied . in the even ( `` optical '' ) mode of ybco@xmath121",
    "a hump appears around @xmath123mev , whereas the odd ( `` acoustic '' ) mode shows a weak hump - like structure at @xmath124mev , separated from the resonance at @xmath125mev .",
    "these features tend to move up in energy in the more underdoped sample ybco@xmath122 , while the resonance in @xmath118 shifts down to @xmath126mev .",
    "although the detailed experimental line shapes are not unique , the qualitative features of our calculation are found in the neutron - scattering spectra . in particular we reproduce the different dependencies on doping level of the resonance at @xmath13 in the odd mode and the hump - like feature at @xmath93 in both modes . also is @xmath127 of the odd mode lower than the @xmath128 of the even mode . theory and experiments",
    "can also be compared quantitatively .",
    "the measured neutron - scattering intensities@xcite are of the same order as the theoretical ones in fig .",
    "[ fig - chi2d ] ( using @xmath129mev , i.e. , @xmath130ev ) . the maximum of the hump in the even , odd mode in fig .",
    "[ fig - chi2d ] occurs at @xmath131mev , @xmath132mev , in good agreement with the measurements ref .   on ybco@xmath121 at low temperature .    , @xmath59 , the ph - threshold @xmath103 , and the resonance energy @xmath13 as function of doping at @xmath83 .",
    "the local magnetic excitation spectrum @xmath133 is characterized by two energy scales that behave differently with hole filling @xmath36 ( doping ) .",
    "the resonance energy @xmath13 follows the particle ",
    "hole threshold @xmath103 , which in underdoped systems is determined by the chemical potential @xmath134 of the fermions as @xmath135 . the maxima of the humps , on the other hand ,",
    "are determined by the gap @xmath9 through @xmath136 .",
    "when @xmath36 is reduced from optimal doping , @xmath137 and therefore @xmath13 decrease quickly , while @xmath9 increases .",
    "this is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - dope ] .",
    "it has been noted above that the mean - field theory describes magnetic excitations in terms of quasi particles ( qp ) ( the fermions ) with a reduced fermi velocity @xmath138 .",
    "hence in underdoped systems the qp s chemical potential comes out ( much ) smaller than the gap , @xmath139 , and thus determines the scale for @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to the observed decoupling of the resonance energy from the gap @xmath9 , while @xmath9 is still visible through the ` humps ' in the local spectrum @xmath113 .",
