    "the seminal work of donaldson regarding lefschetz pencils on symplectic manifolds together with gompf s generalization of thurston s construction of symplectic structures on surface bundles over surfaces show that closed orientable @xmath1-manifolds which admit lefschetz fibrations over the @xmath0-sphere are precisely the closed symplectic @xmath1-manifolds , up to blow - ups .",
    "in contrast , broken lefschetz fibrations , the generalization of lefschetz fibrations where the topology of regular fibers are allowed to change in the expense of introducing a @xmath2-dimensional singular set , exist on all closed smooth oriented @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how far analogues of various results on lefschetz fibrations extend within the class of closed smooth oriented @xmath1-manifolds when broken lefschetz fibrations are considered .",
    "it is the authors contention that constraining the topology of fibers that can appear in a broken lefschetz fibration , and then determining which @xmath1-manifolds can admit such fibrations is an effective way to deal with this abundance .",
    "the classification problem we under take in our article takes this path .",
    "monodromy factorizations of genus one lefschetz fibrations over the @xmath0-sphere , up to hurwitz equivalences , correspond to monodromy factorizations of genus one lefschetz fibrations over the @xmath0-disk with trivial global monodromy .",
    "they were classified by kas and moishezon independently @xcite .",
    "( also see matsumoto s work @xcite . )",
    "this theorem in particular implies that the @xmath1-manifolds that admit non - trivial genus one lefschetz fibrations are very restricted ; namely , only elliptic surfaces @xmath3 admit them @xcite .",
    "we consider a generalization of this famous theorem to broken lefschetz fibrations , aiming to classify simplified broken lefschetz fibrations with fiber genera one and zero .",
    "these simplified broken lefschetz fibrations are the ones where we have at most one round singular circle and connected fibers , which give the honest elliptic lefschetz fibrations when the round singular set is empty . fixing an isomorphism @xmath4 , we consider genus one lefschetz fibrations over the @xmath0-disk whose global monodromy maps to @xmath5 times a positive power of the image of a dehn twist along a non - separating curve in the latter group .",
    "first we generalize kas and moishezon s classification theorem to the monodromies of genus one lefschetz fibrations over the @xmath0-disk with these non - trivial global monodromies ( theorem  [ thm : factor ] , theorem  [ thm : factorb ] , and corollary [ cor : classify ] ) .",
    "to prove this result , we use a graphical method to describe genus one lefschetz fibrations , called a chart description , which is a suitable modification of that given in @xcite .",
    "we then give a list of all closed smooth oriented @xmath1-manifolds admitting a genus one minimal simplified broken lefschetz fibration ( theorem [ classifymanifolds ] and corollary [ classifymanifolds2 ] ) , using the handlebody descriptions studied by the first author in @xcite .",

    "as shown in @xcite , any generic map from a closed orientable @xmath1-manifold to the @xmath0-sphere can be homotoped to a broken lefschetz fibrations over @xmath24 , and thus , these fibrations are found in abundance .",

    "the splittings imply the difference : the @xmath87-handle goes over the @xmath0-handle geometrically twice and algebraically zero times in the untwisted case , and both geometrically and algebraically twice in the twisted case .",

    "let us now describe the kirby diagrams where one attaches a round @xmath0-handle to a lefschetz fibered @xmath1-manifold with boundary .",
    "the round @xmath0-handle attachment to a surface fibration over a circle that bounds a lefschetz fibration is realized as a fiberwise @xmath0-handle attachment .",
    "the attaching circle of the @xmath0-handle @xmath118 of a round @xmath0-handle is a simple closed curve @xmath120 on a regular fiber , which is preserved under the monodromy of this fibration up to isotopy .",
    "since this attachment comes from a fiberwise handle attachment , @xmath118 should have fiber framing zero .",
    "as usual , we do not draw the @xmath87-handle @xmath119 of the round @xmath0-handle , which is forced to be attached in a way that it completes the fiberwise @xmath0-handle attachments .",

    "the usefulness of working with round @xmath0-handles is that one can depict any lefschetz fibration over a disk together with a round @xmath0-handle attachment via explicit kirby diagrams .",
    "we first draw the lefschetz @xmath0-handles following the monodromy data on a regular diagram of @xmath122 ( where @xmath123 is the regular fiber ) with fiber framings @xmath25 , then attaches @xmath118 with fiber framing @xmath117 and includes an extra @xmath87-handle to complete it to a round @xmath0-handle .",

    "the global monodromy is isotopic to @xmath127 , mapping @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "thus , this is a twisted round @xmath0-handle attachment .",
    "both of these examples will be revisited later in the paper .",
    "let @xmath6 be a closed orientable @xmath1-manifold .",
    "we will put further constraints on the broken lefschetz fibrations in consideration to have a more tractable family .",
    "first , we ask the round singular set to be connected , i.e. to consist of one circle only , and its image on @xmath128 to be embedded .",
    "second , we ask all the regular fibers to be connected .",
    "( note that in general round singularities can give rise to disconnected regular fibers . )",
    "this gives a decomposition of the broken lefschetz fibration into three pieces ; a genus @xmath129 lefschetz fibration over a @xmath0-disk we call the _ lower side _ , a genus @xmath130 lefschetz fibration over a @xmath0-disk called the _ higher side _ , and a round cobordism between them containing the round singular set in the interior , where @xmath131 .",
    "the third , and the last condition we impose is to have all the lefschetz singularities on the higher side , which equivalently means that the lower side consists of a trivial genus @xmath129 surface bundle . broken lefschetz fibrations satisfying these properties were extensively studied in @xcite , under the name _ simplified broken lefschetz fibrations _ ( abbreviated sblf ) , which we will adapt herein as well .",
    "( careful reader will notice that in @xcite , the connectivity of fibers was not built into the definition of a simplified fibration .",
    "it was later shown in @xcite that this could always be achieved after a homotopy . )",
    "moreover , if the highest genus of a regular fiber in a given sblf is @xmath130 , we will call it a _",
    "genus @xmath130 simplified broken lefschetz fibration . _",
    "observe that a genus @xmath130 sblf can possibly have empty round singular set , in which case it is an honest genus @xmath130 lefschetz fibration over @xmath128 .",
    "relying on the work of gay - kirby in @xcite , one can always obtain _ achiral _ broken lefschetz fibrations over @xmath128 with embedded round image .",
    "these achiral lefschetz singularities can then be replaced locally by broken lefschetz fibrations , as argued in @xcite .",
    "( or alternatively the construction in @xcite can be employed , where achiral singularities are already avoided . ) furthermore , as observed by williams , one can homotope such a broken lefschetz fibration to one with connected round singular set and embedded round image @xcite .",
    "next , the _ flip - and - slip _ move of @xcite can be employed to obtain a homotopic broken lefschetz fibration with the same properties and with only connected fibers . finally , one can _ push _ the lefschetz singularities to the higher side , as argued in @xcite . in short ,",
    "_ there is always a simplified broken lefschetz fibration on any @xmath6_.    the monodromy representations of sblfs are simple .",
    "let @xmath132 be the subgroup of @xmath133 that consists of elements which fix the embedded curve @xmath120 , up to isotopy .",
    "then there is a natural homomorphism @xmath134 observe that our assumption on the connectivity of fibers implies that @xmath120 is a nonseparating curve .",
    "define @xmath135 to be the set of pairs @xmath136 such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 . recall that when the fiber genus is at least two , fiber - preserving gluing maps are determined uniquely up to isotopy .",
    "hence , given any tuple @xmath139 , we can construct a unique sblf .",
    "if @xmath140 , then one also needs to tell how the pieces are glued along the low genera surface bundles over circles ; amounting to two possible choices for @xmath141 pieces and @xmath142-choices for @xmath143 pieces .",

    "( the middle group does not need to fix the boundaries . )",
    "it is easy to see that the map @xmath147 has kernel isomorphic to @xmath148 .",
    "when we have a sblf , the kernel of @xmath149 is isomorphic to the braid group on @xmath150 with @xmath0-strands , by definition .",

    "( see the _ isotropic blow - up _ example of @xcite , and @xcite for the handlebody argument we reproduce here . )",

    "finally , our choice of orientation for @xmath263 was unimportant , since @xmath254 admits an orientation preserving self - diffeomorphism composed of an orientation reversing diffeomorphism on both components .",
    "when there are lefschetz singularities , we get a genus one lefschetz fibration with monodromy factorization @xmath265 in @xmath41 , whose total spaces is the elliptic surface @xmath266 , given in figure [ genusonelfs2 ] .",

    "this @xmath0-handle can be unlinked from the @xmath2-handle that the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle of the round @xmath0-handle is linking with , giving us the handle diagram on the left hand side of the figure [ trivialgenusonesblfs2 ] .",

    "one can alternatively produce all these sblfs from the standard one on @xmath269 by performing various log @xmath2 transforms along a torus fiber on the higher side and gluck twists along an @xmath128 fiber on the lower side while preserving the fibration structure .",
    "the former yields @xmath267 or @xmath272 , whereas the latter alters the parity and hands us @xmath268 or @xmath270 , respectively .",

    "* now we assume that neither the round singular set nor the set of lefschetz critical points is empty . from our results in the previous sections (",
    "namely , theorems [ thm : factor ] and [ sblfmonodromy ] ) it follows that , possibly after passing to a blow - up , the factorization of the global monodromy on the higher side is hurwitz equivalent to @xmath274 , for some non - negative integers @xmath43 and @xmath92 .",
    "using the blow - up argument we gave in section [ section : sblf ] , it is easy to see that when @xmath275 , we in fact get the blow - ups of any the genus one sblfs with one round singular circle covered in the previous case . below , we will focus on the case @xmath276 for @xmath43 non - negative .",
    "recall that to identify the total space of such a fibration , we also need to know the identification of the boundaries of the higher and lower side with the ends of the round cobordism in between .",
    "let us first assume that the higher side is identified using the identity , and postpone the discussion of the ` twisted ' cases .",
    "then there is a section of the genus one fibration on the higher side which extends through the round cobordism .",
    "this can be matched with a section of the trivial genus zero fibration on the lower side to get a global section @xmath277 of the broken lefschetz fibration , with self - intersection @xmath56 equals the sum of the self - intersection of the disk section of the genus one fibration and the disk section of the genus zero fibration contained in @xmath277 . the latter self - intersection can be any integer ; this can be thought of the number of times the fibers are fully rotated when identifying the @xmath128 bundles over @xmath103 on the boundaries of the lower side and the round cobordism .",
    "nevertheless , we are going to see that the total space is independent of @xmath56 .",
    "note that a slight extension of the classical observation of moishezon shows that any orientation and fiber preserving self - diffeomorphism of the boundary of the higher side with global monodromy @xmath278 ( and therefore of @xmath274 ) can be extended to the interior ( an elementary proof of which is given in @xcite ) , so we can keep assuming that the @xmath0-handle of the round @xmath0-handle is attached as shown in figure [ calculus1a ] .",
    "figure [ calculus1a ] gives a handlebody description of such a sblf .",
    "the section @xmath277 is represented by the @xmath0-handle with framing @xmath56 , linking the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle capping off the obvious genus one surface given by the two @xmath2-handles .",

    "the first three pairs are drawn thicker in the figure .",
    "we will demonstrate our kirby calculus arguments first using these three pairs , before handling the remaining @xmath282 pairs inductively .",

    "this includes sliding the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle corresponding to the fiber over the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle of the round @xmath0-handle twice , and then isotoping it away from the other @xmath2-handle together as well ( while the @xmath56-framed @xmath0-handle is dragged away with it ) . the resulting diagram is given in figure [ calculus1b ] .",
    "the rest of the calculus is captured in figures [ calculus2a ] and [ calculus2b ] . here",
    "any @xmath0-handle whose framing is not indicated should be understood to have framing @xmath25 . in the following paragraphs we spell out the details of this calculus ,",
    "step by step .",
    "the first diagram in figure [ calculus2a ] is obtained after canceling the @xmath2-handle against the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle of the round @xmath0-handle going over it once , and then sliding - off the remaining lowest lefschetz handle linking with the far left lefschetz @xmath0-handle only .",
    "the framing of the latter @xmath0-handle now becomes @xmath117 .",
    "in this process , we slid - off all the @xmath92 lefschetz handles corresponding to @xmath281 as well , so we get a total of @xmath283 @xmath0-handles with framing @xmath25 separated from the rest of the diagram .    to obtain the second diagram",
    ", we slide the second lefschetz handle from the left of the first diagram over the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle on the far left .",
    "observe that these two handles were linking with the rest of the handles in the exact same way , so the handle we slide gets separated from the bigger chunk of our diagram .",
    "then the lefschetz @xmath0-handle in the very bottom of the diagram links only with the far left @xmath0-handle and it can be slided - off it , turning this handle s framing to @xmath76 .",
    "the third diagram contains one of the crucial steps in our inductive argument that is to follow .",
    "namely , we slide the second ( originally the third ) lefschetz @xmath0-handle from the left in the second diagram over the very first @xmath0-handle , resulting in a @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle that no longer links with the @xmath2-handle and links only with this very first @xmath0-handle .",
    "the fourth diagram is obtained by sliding all the @xmath0-handles that link with the far left @xmath0-handle , using the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle linking with it .",
    "in particular this splits off another @xmath284-framed @xmath0-handle .",
    "importantly , the diagram now reduces to the far left @xmath0-handle going over the @xmath2-handle once and with a @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle that appears as a meridian to it , and @xmath282 pairs of lefschetz @xmath0-handles following the very same pattern that @xmath285 pairs did so before .        the first diagram of figure [ calculus2b ] is simply obtained by inductively applying the above calculus for all these triples of pairs of lefschetz @xmath0-handles .",
    "we therefore get a total of @xmath286 copies of @xmath284-framed @xmath0-handles disjoint from the rest of the diagram , in addition to the @xmath92 copies of @xmath284-framed @xmath0-handles we have separated at the very beginning .",
    "we pass to the second diagram by sliding the @xmath56 copies of @xmath287-framed @xmath0-handles over the far left @xmath287-framed @xmath0-handle and then unlinking them using the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle .",
    "doing this for all , we produce @xmath43 pairs of @xmath117 and @xmath0-framed @xmath0-handles linking once .",
    "the third diagram is obtained by canceling the @xmath2-handle against the @xmath287-framed @xmath0-handle running over it once , and then canceling the @xmath117-framed unlinked unknot against the @xmath87-handle .",
    "moreover , the pairs of @xmath117 and @xmath0-framed @xmath0-handles can be turned into pairs of @xmath117 framed @xmath0-handles linking once with each other using the standard sliding argument for each one of them .",
    "( that is , slide the @xmath0-framed handle over the linking @xmath117-framed handle to change the framing of it by two , while still keeping them linked with each other only once . )    for the fourth and last diagram , we observe that in the presence of @xmath284-framed @xmath0-handles ( which we will have even when @xmath56 and @xmath92 are zero ) , the pair of @xmath117 and @xmath56-framed @xmath0-handles linking once can be turned into a disjoint pair of @xmath76 and @xmath284 framed @xmath0-handles .",
    "hence , the @xmath1-manifold which is the total space of this sblf is @xmath288    we can now turn to the remaining case ; when the boundary fibration of the higher side is identified with the higher end of the round cobordism using a twisted gluing .",
    "when the fibration is cooked up this way , instead of the @xmath0-handle representing the section @xmath277 , we get a @xmath0-handle linking with the @xmath2-handles and the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle corresponding to the fiber ( and linking with no other handle )",
    ". however , this handle could be slid - off from the first @xmath2-handle ( for @xmath153 ) using the @xmath117-framed @xmath0-handle of the round @xmath0-handle first , and from the second @xmath2-handle ( for @xmath154 ) using the @xmath287-framed @xmath0-handle in the second diagram in figure [ calculus2b ] .",
    "moreover , it can be unlinked from this @xmath287-framed @xmath0-handle using the @xmath117-meridian repeatedly .",
