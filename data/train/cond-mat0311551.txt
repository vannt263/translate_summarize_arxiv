    "many pathological diseases , including sickle cell anemia  @xcite and genetic cataracts  @xcite , are known to be caused by the crystallization of certain globular proteins .",

    "exploring protein structure and activities ( proteomics ) is a growing research field and should help in our understanding of health and disease on a molecular basis  @xcite .",
    "advances in decoding genomes , however , have far and away surpassed those in the determination of protein structure .",
    "the growth of high quality protein crystals from solution is important in determining structure and is known to depend sensitively on the initial conditions of the solution .",
    "unfortunately , knowledge of the initial conditions necessary for optimal crystallization has not come easily  @xcite .",
    "significant progress in understanding the relationship of the initial conditions to the crystal nucleation rates for globular proteins has been made in recent years .",
    "it was demonstrated in the theoretical work by gast , hall , and russel  @xcite that the characteristics of the phase diagram of colloids depend sensitively on the range of attraction between the colloidal particles .",
    "it was found that for a colloid - colloid attractive interaction of very short range ( less than some thirty percent of the colloidal diameter ) , there are stable fluid and crystal phases and a metastable fluid - fluid phase located below the liquidus line .",
    "other studies  @xcite have found similar results .",
    "this has also been demonstrated in both experiment  @xcite and simulation  @xcite .",
    "rosenbaum , zamora , and zukoski  @xcite linked the experimental observations of george and wilson  @xcite with those of colloids .",
    "they found that the narrow range in the second virial coefficient for which globular proteins crystallize map onto an effective temperature range for colloidal systems .",
    "the phase diagrams of the two systems were analogous .",
    "ten wolde and frenkel  @xcite then calculated the phase diagram and nucleation rate for a modified lennard - jones model of globular proteins , whose range of attractive interaction was small compared with the protein diameter . in this seminal work they showed that the nucleation rate increased by many orders of magnitude in the vicinity of the critical point , suggesting a direct route to effective crystallization .",
    "therefore , accurate knowledge of the region around the critical point provides important information regarding crystallization .",
    "ten wolde and frankel  @xcite studied a modified lennard - jones ( mlj ) pairwise interaction model given by    @xmath0^{6 } }                     -                     \\frac{\\alpha}{[(r/\\sigma)^{2}-1]^{3}})&\\mbox{$r\\ge\\sigma$}.                     \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    v(r ) is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath1 denotes the hard - core diameter of the particles , _ r _ is the interparticle distance , and @xmath2 is the well depth . the width of the attractive well can be adjusted by varying the parameter @xmath3 ; it was tuned in such a way that the so - called stickiness parameter @xmath4  @xcite was equal to that produced by the hard - core yukawa  @xcite potential for @xmath5 at the metastable liquid - vapor critical point , where @xmath6 is a measure of the range of the attractive part of the potential . in the yukawa model ,",
    "the phase diagram for @xmath7 was found to be equivalent to that of globular proteins and maps onto those determined experimentally  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the mlj potential is that it lends itself naturally to both monte carlo and molecular dynamic simulations .",
    "of particular interest both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite is the metastable fluid - fluid curve of the phase diagram , for reasons noted above .",
    "ten wolde and frenkel  @xcite determined the phase diagram for the above model using the gibbs ensemble monte carlo ( gemc ) method  @xcite where two coexisting phases are separated into two physically detached but thermodynamically connected boxes , the volumes of which are allowed to fluctuate under constant pressure . in the neighborhood of the critical point , however , gemc can not be relied upon to provide accurate estimates of the coexistence curve parameters  @xcite .",
    "this is evident by considering the metastable region of the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the error bars in the data points grow larger as the critical point is approached ; there are no data points in the immediate vicinity of the critical point .",
    "the purpose of this paper , then , is to accurately determine the critical point of the phase diagram of ten wolde and frenkel using finite size scaling techniques adapted for simple fluids by bruce and wilding and to accurately determine the corresponding subcritical region using the hyper - parallel tempering method .",
    "to study the critical region of the phase diagram , we use the bruce and wilding  @xcite finite - size scaling method , along with histogram - reweighting  @xcite techniques , in conjunction with grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "we write the reduced chemical potential as @xmath8 and the reduced well depth as @xmath9 , with _",
    "t _ the temperature of the system . in",
    "what follows , we denote @xmath10 as @xmath11 for simplicity .",
    "the critical point is identified by the critical values of the reduced chemical potential @xmath12 and well depth @xmath13 .",

    "the critical point of the fluid can thus be estimated by tuning the temperature _ t _ , chemical potential @xmath11 , and field - mixing parameter _ s _",

    "only particle insertion and deletion steps were employed , particle displacements being realized within the cell from a succession of such steps . in our simulations , equilibrium times used were approximately two million steps and production runs ranged from 500 million steps for the smaller system sizes to one billion steps for the higher system sizes .",
    "such a high number of steps was needed in order to obtain smooth distributions at the low temperatures we are studying .",
    "we emphasize that the true equilibrium state of the system is that of fluid and solid coexistence .",
    "gcmc , however , is limited to low densities and , thus , the solid region of the phase diagram is unaccessible .    using a previous estimate of the critical temperature  @xcite for this model",
    ", we first attempted to locate the critical point by tuning the reduced chemical potential @xmath66 until the density distribution exhibited a double peaked structure .",
    "once obtained , longer runs were performed to accumulate better statistics . to obtain two - phase coexistence and appropriate values of the field - mixing parameter _ s _ , we adopted the criterion  @xcite that the order distribution @xmath67 be symmetric in @xmath68 .",
    "this criterion is the counterpart of the coexistence symmetry condition for the ising model magnetization distribution .",
    "having obtained in this manner a two - phase distribution near the critical point , we then matched the order - operator distribution @xmath35 to that of the universal fixed point distribution @xmath36 .",
    "employing histogram - reweighting , we tuned the chemical potential @xmath66 , temperature _ t _ , and mixed - field parameter _",
    "s _ until our distribution @xmath35 collapsed onto that of the fixed point distribution .",
    "once that was attained , we then attempted to match @xmath69 to the corresponding energy - like fixed point distribution @xmath70 by tuning the field - mixing parameter _ r_.",
    "this procedure was repeated for the various system sizes studied .    in the subcritical region , we used six replicas for the @xmath71 system to obtain joint probability distributions .",
    "small runs of approximately five million steps were first performed to optimize the choice of @xmath66 for each replica . at low temperatures ,",
    "@xmath66 was chosen so that the density distribution was biased toward a high - density peak ; conversely , at high temperatures , @xmath66 was chosen so that low - density peaks were favored .",
    "such a choice of @xmath66 allowed high - density configurations to be `` melted '' when passed to high temperatures , allowing for a fuller exploration of configuration space  @xcite . also , we chose these values so that a high swap frequency between replicas was realized . on average",
    ", replicas were swapped twenty - five percent of the time .",
    "once these criteria were satisfied , monte carlo runs were extended to approximately 150 million steps to acquire good statistics .",
    "histogram - reweighting was then applied to the resulting joint probability distributions to obtain coexistence in the subcritical region in accordance with eq .",
    "( 12 ) and eq .",
    "the resulting density distributions obtained in the prescribed manner at the size - dependent critical point @xmath72 and @xmath73 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . as is evident , the distributions become narrower with increasing system size @xmath74 , approaching the limiting form of the fixed point distribution @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding energy - density distributions are shown in fig .",
    "both distributions show an asymmetry , due to field - mixing effects , with that of @xmath75 being much more pronounced .",
    "these effects die off with increasing l , so that the limiting forms of both @xmath76 and @xmath75 match the fixed point distribution @xmath36 . as noted",
    ", this limiting form is easily recognizable for the density distributions .",
    "however , the limiting form of the energy density distributions does not follow this pattern .",
    "this difference is attributable to the coupling that occurs for asymmetric systems between the ordering operator and energy - like operator fluctuations .",
    "those of @xmath77 dominate at large l , while those in @xmath78 do not  @xcite .",
    "thus , a background effect perturbs the energy - density distributions .    our estimates for the fixed point distribution",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "as is seen from the figure , the agreement is good for all system sizes studied .",
    "this matching alone allows us to accurately determine the critical point @xmath72 and @xmath79 and to also obtain good estimates of the field - mixing parameter _",
    "s_. though matching of @xmath69 to @xmath70 should also give good estimates of the critical point , and the field - mixing parameter _",
    "r _ , fluctuations in the energy - like operator @xmath78 are relatively weak and therefore do not allow for good matching  @xcite . it is unknown presently how to remove this background effect for fluid - systems , though it has been removed for the ising model  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can still obtain a rough estimate for the field - mixing parameter _",
    "r _ by observing that the distributions @xmath69 should have a shape similar to @xmath70 . for completeness , we include these curves along with the energy - fixed point function in fig .",
    "5 .    from estimates of the finite critical - point temperatures",
    "@xmath72 , we can estimate the critical - point for the infinite - volume system . since contributions to @xmath35 from finite values of @xmath4 grow with system size like @xmath80 , the matching condition results in a deviation from the true critical point @xmath81 as @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the universal correction to scaling exponent  @xcite and @xmath30 is the critical exponent for the correlation length  @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 , we plot the apparent critical temperature @xmath72 as a function of @xmath84 . by extrapolating to infinite volume",
    ", we arrive at an estimate for the true critical temperature .",

    "7 , @xmath86 is plotted as a function of @xmath87 to obtain an estimate of the true critical density .",
    "we summarize our findings in table i.    .[tab : table1]summary of results for location of the critical point [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using hptmc , we were able to obtain joint distribution functions corresponding to points in the subcritical region of the phase diagram of ten wolde and frenkel .",
    "the choices we employed for the values of the temperature _ t _ and chemical potential @xmath66 of each replica are displayed in table ii , along with the coexisting chemical potentials @xmath88 and coexisting densities @xmath89 and @xmath90 , obtained after reweighting .",
    "the corresponding density distributions in this region are shown in fig .",
    "8 , where the temperatures are expressed in terms of the infinite - volume critical temperature .",
    "it can be seen that for temperatures even as high as @xmath91 , the system has a vanishingly small probability of visiting a state between the two coexisting phases .",
    "this implies , as stated previously , that one can not expect standard monte carlo simulations to obtain these subcritical distributions .    in fig .",
    "9 , we plot the temperatures used in table ii as a function of density , where we have calculated the average densities for each of the two phases from the distributions shown in fig .",
    "these new results are consistent with the earlier results for the metastable coexistence curve of the phase diagram  @xcite and extend much closer to the critical point .",
    "we also show our attempt to fit this subcritical density data to a power - law of the form @xmath92 , where @xmath40 and @xmath93 are are our extrapolated values as @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the ising exponent .",
    "although the data are in reasonable agreement with this fit , note that we have not accounted for possible finite - size effects , preventing this from being a definitive test .",

    "experimental  @xcite investigations on the bovine lens protein , @xmath96 , have been performed near the critical point .",
    "they report values for the critical isothermal compressibility @xmath97 and the critical correlation length @xmath98 .",
    "both results are compatible to three - dimensional ising model values .",
