    "in geometric quantum mechanics , the systems are described based on their underlying geometrical structures @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that such geometrical structures of quantum theory provide us with useful information on the foundations of the theory with many applications in quantum science and technology @xcite . in geometric formulation of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the projective hilbert space is constructed by general hopf fibration of a hypersphere and usually is called the quantum phase space of a pure quantum state .",
    "however , pure quantum states are a small subclass of all quantum states . on the other hand , mixed quantum states represented by density operators @xmath0 are the most general states in quantum mechanics .",
    "+ if on a manifold a lie group acts transitively then it is called a homogeneous space . moreover ,",
    "if the lie algebra of the lie group has a reductive decomposition then the manifold is called reductive homogeneous space .",
    "there are two important classes of reductive homogeneous spaces namely , symmetric spaces and generalized flag manifold . in this work",
    "we will show that the quantum phase space of mixed quantum states is a a generalized flag manifold which is equipped with a symplectic form that also coincides with a specific khler structure which is called kirillov - kostant - souriau khler ( kks ) symplectic form on the co - adjoint orbit and a riemannian metric @xcite .",
    "then we will construct a fiber bundle over the quantum phase space based on the symplectic reduction method following a similar construction given in @xcite .",
    "finally we will define a mechanical connection on the total space which alow us to give the first application of the construction , namely a geometric phase based on the holonomy group .",
    "in this section we will review our geometric framework for mixed quantum states based on kks structure .",
    "first , we will review the basic definition and construction of the mixed quantum states based on a khler structure @xcite .",
    "then , we will discuss symplectic form and an almost complex structures on the quantum phase space .",
    "let @xmath1 be the space of hermitian matrices .",
    "then the orbit of @xmath2 action on @xmath3 is the submanifolds with real eigenvalues which are diagonalizable @xmath4 that is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is diagonal and @xmath7 .",
    "thus the coadjoint of @xmath2 are the same as conjugacy classes of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath8 consists of @xmath9 distinct values with multiplicities @xmath10 .",
    "then the orbit space @xmath11 is diffeomorphic with homogeneous space @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the eigenvalues of @xmath11 .",
    "then any element in @xmath11 is determined by the sequence of its eigenspaces @xmath14 , where @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the multiplicity of @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 are mutually orthogonal and the stabilizer of that matrix corresponding to @xmath20 is @xmath21 which prove the proposition .    if @xmath22 , then @xmath11 is diffeomorphic to @xmath23 .",
    "proof follows from the observation that a hermitian matrix with spectrum @xmath24 is completely determined by its @xmath25eigenspace .",
    "let @xmath26 be the lie algebra of @xmath2 . then",
    "a map @xmath27 defined by @xmath28 is an isomorphism from real vector space @xmath3 to a real vector space @xmath26 of skew - hermitian matrices .",
    "now we can equip the space @xmath3 with a symmetric bilinear form @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 which is invariant under conjugation .",
    "we also can identify @xmath31 with its dual @xmath32 .",
    "now , for any @xmath33 we define a skew - symmetric bilinear form on @xmath34 by @xmath35\\rho).\\ ] ] the kernel of @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37=0\\}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath36 is the stabilizer of @xmath0 for the action of @xmath2 on the space of hermitian matrices by conjugation .",
    "now , let @xmath38 .",
    "then we have @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "it is also easy to prove that @xmath43 is close , that is @xmath47 .",
    "here we review the construction of an almost complex structure on the quantum phase space @xmath11 .",
    "we decompose the lie algebra @xmath26 as follows @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a complex vector space .",
    "we can write an explicit matrix form for any skew - hermitian matrix by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are complex matrices . now let @xmath53 .",

    ". moreover , an almost complex structure @xmath70 on @xmath11 can be written as @xmath71=[u(n)j(x ) u^{-1}(n),\\rho]$ ] .",
    "+ the complex structure preserves @xmath72 , since @xmath73 . and @xmath74 define a riemannian metric on @xmath11 .",
    "thus the quantum phase space can be equipped by a hermitian inner - product @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a riemannian metric on quantum phase space .",
    "the importance of this form stems from the fact that if @xmath77 is the expectation value function of a hermitian operator @xmath78 , that is @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the hamiltonian vector field associated with @xmath77 , which is implicitly defined by the identity @xmath81 then @xmath82.\\ ] ] thus , in particular , the von neumann equation on @xmath11 is the hamiltonian flow equation of the expected energy function with respect to the form .",
    "in this section we will attempt to construct a fiber bundle over the quantum phase space based on the symplectic reduction and the purification method .",
    "we will follow the construction that has been considered in @xcite .",
    "in particular , first we will show that the map from @xmath83 to @xmath84 is a riemannian submersion and then construct a fiber bundle over the quantum phase space based on symplectic reduction .",
    "a reductive homogeneous spaces has a fixed decomposition of the lie algebra @xmath85 such that @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , a homogeneous space is called reductive if there exists a decomposition of lie algebra @xmath85 such that @xmath88    [ fig11 ]   and the decomposition of @xmath89.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    let @xmath90 be a natural projection with @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 induces an isomorphism @xmath93 the map @xmath90 is a fibration and also a submersion .",
    "now , he killing form @xmath94 of @xmath83 is non - degenrate on @xmath49 , thus the symplectic form @xmath95 can be written uniquely in terms of @xmath96-antisymmetric linear transformation @xmath97 on @xmath49 such that @xmath98 one can show that for a closed form @xmath95 , @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 for all @xmath101 . in this case",
    "we get @xmath102,y)=b(\\gamma,[x , y]).\\ ] ] let the isotropy @xmath103 of the manifold @xmath104 be represented as block diagonal so that in the case of @xmath105 maximal torus ( hence largest dimensional co - adjoint orbit ) , @xmath103 consists of the diagonal matrices .",
    "the tangent bundle @xmath106 can be decomposed to vertical @xmath107 sub bundle and a horizontal sub bundle @xmath108 , that is @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath112 be the orthogonal complement with respect to @xmath83 .",
    "now , a riemannian submersion @xmath90 is a submersion with the property that @xmath113 is an isometry when restricted to @xmath114",
    ". +    let @xmath115 be a riemannian manifold and let @xmath116 be a smooth , free and proper action , where @xmath103 acts by isometries of @xmath83 .",

    "now , one can show that @xmath127 does not depend on the choice of @xmath128 in the fiber @xmath129 and @xmath130 is a smooth family .",
    "the first follows from the fact that , if @xmath131 , then there is some @xmath132 and a diffeomorphism @xmath133 such that @xmath134 and @xmath135 induces an isometry between @xmath136 and @xmath137 which also commute with the map @xmath138 .",
    "thus @xmath127 does not depend on the choice of @xmath139 .",
    "let @xmath140 be a killing orthonormal basis for their killing - orthogonal complement .",
    "so , in the case @xmath103 is a diagonal matrix , this would mean that the basis @xmath140 for the lie algebra @xmath141 are generated by @xmath142 for @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the matrix with 1 in position @xmath145 and zero elsewhere .",
    "( we could multiply it by @xmath146 to make the model a skew - hermitian rather than hermitian ) .",
    "these same @xmath140 are a basis for the tangent space @xmath147 to @xmath104 . the induced - by - riemannian submersion metric for @xmath104 is the same .",
    "namely the @xmath140 continue to be orthonormal .",
    "this means that we have @xmath148 thus we have a riemannian submersion @xmath149 , where the bi - invariant metric on @xmath83 is generated by the killing form @xmath94 defined explicitly as @xmath150 and the symplectic form is the same as the kks form @xmath151 .",
    "moreover on @xmath104 the metric is @xmath152 .",
    "note also that @xmath94 is @xmath153-invariant , that is @xmath154 for all @xmath132 and @xmath155 .",
    "consider a density operator with @xmath9- dimensional support having a spectrum given by @xmath156 , where @xmath157 , for all @xmath158 are positive eigenvalues listed in descending order .",
    "next we identify the @xmath11 as @xmath83-orbit with a fix spectrum @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , we let @xmath159 be a @xmath9-dimensional hilbert space which is span by the following orthonormal basis @xmath160 . furthermore , let @xmath161 be the space of linear operator from @xmath159 to @xmath162 .",
    "let @xmath83 be the set of map @xmath128 in @xmath161 such that @xmath163 in the next step we define a principal fiber bundle which is equivalent with the coadjoint orbits @xmath164 where @xmath165 . in the simplest case when @xmath166 , then @xmath167 is the unit sphere in the hilbert space and @xmath11 is the projective space over @xmath162 .",
    "+ next we note that the unitary group @xmath168 acts on @xmath161 from the right by isometric and symplectic transformations , that is @xmath169 , where @xmath170 .",

    "now , we define the momentum map @xmath179 by @xmath180",
    ". one can show that the momentum map @xmath181 is a coadjoint - equivariant momentum map for the @xmath168 action on @xmath161 .",
    "+ let @xmath182 be the space of functional on the lie algebra @xmath171 .",
    "that is @xmath182 are represented by density operators on @xmath159 and @xmath183 since @xmath184 is a density operator on @xmath159 in case @xmath128 is a normalized map from @xmath159 to @xmath162 .",
    "thus the momentum map @xmath181 maps @xmath161 onto @xmath182 .",
    "moreover , @xmath185 is a subset of @xmath161 for very density operator @xmath186 on @xmath159 since @xmath187 gives @xmath188 .",
    "note that two density operators on @xmath159 are unitary equivalent , that is their corresponding functionals belong to the same coadjoint orbit in @xmath175 if and only if they have same spectra .",
    "thus the orbit corresponding to the spectrum @xmath24 contains the density operator @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",

    "moreover , @xmath108 is the kernel bundle of mechanical connection @xmath214 defined by @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is metric momentum map and @xmath217 is the locked inertia tensor defined by @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath220 is of constant bi - invariant type because @xmath221 is an adjoint - invariant form on the lie algebra @xmath212 that is independent of the @xmath128 .",
