    "<S> generally one is interested in computing @xmath80 to leading - order in @xmath81 . for this </S>",

    "<S> the contribution of the former term cancels again for parity reasons upon integration over @xmath85 . the latter term </S>",
    "<S> , corresponding to a stationary state @xmath24 in which the atom is static , can be evaluated using the equilibrium fdt ( [ fdt ] ) , i.e. @xmath86 . because of the motion - induced doppler - shift , only frequency modes @xmath87 contribute , implying that very low frequencies are relevant at small velocities . </S>",
    "<S> since the atomic polarizability and the green tensor are susceptibilities , they satisfy the crossing relation and their imaginary parts , being odd in @xmath88 , vanish at @xmath89 in our case @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the above argument proves that , within our description for the atom , the lowest - order expansion in velocity of the zero - temperature , stationary frictional force on an atom moving above a planar surface is at least cubic in @xmath67 . in principle , however , in addition to that in there could be other @xmath96 contributions to the frictional force arising from @xmath67-derivatives of @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> also , when either of the @xmath88-derivatives of the two tensors in ( [ friction - exact ] ) vanish at @xmath89 , higher - order terms in @xmath67 must be considered .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding the dependency of the stationary frictional force ( [ friction - exact ] ) on the atom - surface separation , it must be emphasized that the @xmath98 scaling arises solely from the @xmath91-dependency of the green tensor . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to the fdt , the qrt predicts that for slow velocities the quantum frictional force is linear in @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown above , such a dependency results in principle from contributions of @xmath101 in ( [ friction2 ] ) . using the qrt expression for the two - time correlation tensor in the static case , @xmath102 , and taking the @xmath20 limit </S>",
