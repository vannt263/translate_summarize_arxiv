    "primordial non - gaussianity has been attracting attention as a new probe of the physics of the early universe , e.g. , inflation models .",
    "there are a lot of theoretical models of predicting the primordial curvature fluctuations with the large non - gaussian features and several types of the primordial non - gaussianity have been predicted ( for recent reviews , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the observational side , precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "anisotropies are ones of the most powerful tools to hunt for the primordial non - gaussianity ( see e.g. refs .",
    "current cmb data indicates that the primordial adiabatic fluctuations follow nearly perfect gaussianity .",
    "however , there still remains the possibility of detecting the non - gaussianity in the future experiments such as planck  @xcite . in the cmb experiments ,",
    "the non - gaussianity could be detected by non - zero higher order correlation functions such as the three - point function ( bispectrum ) and the four - point one ( trispectrum ) .",
    "recently , the observations of the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe have been also focused on as other powerful tools to detect the primordial non - gaussianity just as the cmb observations ( see e.g. refs .",
    "in particular , it is known that the primordial non - gaussianity induces the modification of the halo mass function for more massive objects at higher redshift  ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) and also a scale - dependence of the halo bias  ( see e.g. refs .",
    "since future surveys of the lss will provide a large amount of samples of galaxies over a huge volume , it is expected that the lss observations would give a tighter constraint on the primordial non - gaussianity comparable to that obtained from the future cmb observations  @xcite .    in accordance with the recent progress of observations ,",
    "we are invited to consider the effect of the higher order non - gaussianities , e.g. , the non - zero four point correlation function of the primordial fluctuations @xcite , or that of the primordial non - gaussianity in a multi - field inflationary model where the primordial fluctuations are sourced from multi - field fluctuations  @xcite . following these works , in this paper",
    ", we investigate the halo bias in the case where the primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations are given by  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a model has been dubbed `` ungaussiton '' model .",
    "this type of the non - gaussianity can be realized in the case where the primordial fluctuations are sourced from both the inflaton and the curvaton fluctuations and the curvaton stays at the origin during inflation . in this case ,",
    "due to the absence of the linear term of @xmath4 the non - zero bispectrum and trispectrum of the curvature perturbations respectively come from the six- and eight - orders in @xmath4 .",
    "hence , this model predicts a specific consistency relation between the bispectrum and the trispectrum which would be confirmed in the cmb experiments and it should be interesting to examine the effect of such a primordial non - gaussianity on the lss surveys , in particular , the scale - dependence of the halo bias . in order to obtain an analytic expression for the halo bias , we employ the peak - background split formula  @xcite which is a useful tool to calculate the halo bias with the local - type non - gaussianity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the so - called `` ungaussiton '' model and show the expression for the bispectrum and the trispectrum of the primordial curvature fluctuations in this model and also the consistency relation between the bispectrum and the trispectrum . in section",

    "the equation  ( [ eq : halodens ] ) is one of the main result of this paper .",
    "however , defining the halo bias from this equation is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "hence , let us consider the cross power spectrum of the density fluctuations of halos and matter fluctuations and also the power spectrum of the density fluctuations of halos .",

    ", we can find the enhancement of @xmath69 on large scales ( @xmath71 ) in the `` ungaussiton '' model compared with the case with @xmath72 .",
    "the scale - dependence of the bias of halos has been recently focused on as a powerful tool to give a constraint on the primordial non - gaussianity from the lss surveys . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the halo bias in the ungaussiton model , which predicts the large primordial non - gaussianity induced from a gaussian - squared field , by employing the peak - background split formalism .",
    "this model can be realized in the case where the primordial fluctuations are sourced from both the inflaton and the curvaton fluctuations and the curvaton stays at the origin during inflation , and predicts the large non - gaussianity and the specific relation between the non - linearity parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we calculate not only the power spectrum of the density fluctuations of halos but also the cross power spectrum of the matter density fluctuations and halo density fluctuations .",
    "then , we find that in the ungaussiton model the effect of the non - gaussianity on the halo bias , which appears in the power spectrum of the halo density fluctuations , differs from that in the standard local - type non - gaussianity case due to the different consistency relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
