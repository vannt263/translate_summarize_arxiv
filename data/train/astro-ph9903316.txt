    "interstellar dust is composed of heavy elements made and ejected by stars . dwek & scalo ( 1980 ) demonstrated that supernovae are the dominant source for the formation of dust grains .",
    "they also showed that the dust is destroyed in supernova shocks ( see also mckee 1989 , jones et al .",
    "1994 , and jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the dust is formed and destroyed in star - forming galaxies .",
    "some recent galaxy - evolution models treat the evolution of total dust mass as well as that of metal abundance ( wang 1991 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 , hereafter lf98 ; dwek 1998 , hereafter d98 ; hirashita 1999 , hereafter h99 ) .",
    "the processes of dust formation and destruction by supernovae are taken into account in lf98 , in order to explain the relation between dust - to - gas mass ratio and metallicity of dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) and blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdgs )",
    ". we can find detailed mathematical formulations to calculate the dust mass in any galactic system in d98 , which treats the accretion of heavy elements onto preexisting dust grains in molecular clouds in addition to the processes considered in lf98 .",
    "the model by d98 is successfully applied to nearby spiral galaxies in h99 .",
    "it is suggested in d98 that the accretion process onto preexisting dust grains is not effective in dwarf galaxies because of the absence of dense molecular clouds there .",
    "if this is true , it is worth estimating the ineffectiveness quantitatively , by which we can obtain an information about molecular clouds in dwarf galaxies .",
    "direct observations of molecular clouds in some dwarf galaxies have been extensively carried out ( e.g. , ohta , sasaki , & sait 1988 ) . however , it is generally difficult to observe extragalactic molecular clouds .",
    "thus , theoretical constraints on the nature of molecular clouds are indispensable for investigations on the star formation processes in extragalactic objects .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the relation between dust - to - gas ratio as a function of metallicity by using a set of equations in h99 .",
    "the model is one - zone ( i.e. , the spatial distribution of physical quantities within a galaxy is not taken into account ) and the instantaneous recycling approximation is applied .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to apply the model to dwarf galaxies ( dirrs and bcdgs ) .",
    "first of all , in the next section , we explain the model equation , through which the dust - to - gas ratio as a function of metallicity is calculated .",
    "the result is compared with observational data of dirrs and bcdgs in  3 .",
    "we present a summary in the final section .",
    "in order to investigate the dust content in galaxies , h99 derived a set of equations describing the dust formation and destruction processes , based on the models in lf98 and d98 . in h99 , a simple one - zone model for a galaxy",
    "is adopted to extract global properties of galaxies . for the model treating the radial distribution of gas , element , and dust in a galaxy , see d98 .",
    "the equation set is written as @xmath0 ( see eqs .",

    "the metal is labeled by @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , c , si , mg , fe , @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the total mass of the metal @xmath2 ( in gas and dust phases ) and the mass of the metal @xmath2 in the dust phase , respectively . the star formation rate is denoted by @xmath7",
    "; @xmath8 is the total injection rate of mass from stars ; @xmath9 is the net outflow rate from the galaxy ; @xmath10 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 is the total injection rate of element @xmath2 from stars ; @xmath13 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath2 locked up in dust ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) . the meanings of the other parameters in the above equations are as follows : @xmath15 is the value of the dust mass fraction in the injected material , in other words , the dust condensation efficiency in the ejecta ; @xmath16 refers to the efficiency of the dust destruction during star formation [ @xmath17 corresponds to destruction of only the dust incorporated into the star , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) corresponds to a net destruction ( formation ) in the star formation ] ; @xmath20 is the accretion timescale of the element @xmath2 onto preexisting dust particles in molecular clouds ; @xmath21 is the timescale of dust destruction by supernova shocks ; @xmath22 accounts for the dust content in the outflow ( @xmath23 means no dust in the outflow , while @xmath24 indicates that the outflow is as dusty as the interstellar medium ) .",
    "we should comment on the parameter @xmath16 here . since the protostellar disk forms dust",
    ", @xmath25 is expected . however , as to the circumstellar dust , the timescale of loss of angular momentum through the poynting - robertson effect is much shorter than the lifetime of stars ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "this means that the formed dust is lost effectively .",
    "thus , we reasonably assume that @xmath17 hereafter .",
    "the formation of planets also contributes to the loss of the dust .    here",
    ", we adopt the same assumption as lf98 and h99 ; the instantaneous recycling approximation ( tinsley 1980 ) : stars less massive than @xmath26 live forever and the others die instantaneously .",
    "this approximation allows us to write @xmath8 and @xmath12 , respectively , as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the returned fraction of the mass that has formed stars which is subsequently ejected into the interstellar space , and @xmath29 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath2 newly produced and ejected by stars . and @xmath30 for the notation in lf98 . ] @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be obtained using the following formulae ( maeder 1992 ) : @xmath31 in equation ( [ eqr ] ) , @xmath32 is the initial mass function ( imf ) , and @xmath33 is the upper mass cutoff of stellar mass .",
    "the imf is normalized so that the integral of @xmath34 in the full range of the stellar mass becomes 1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 has a dimension of the inverse square of the mass . in equation ( [ eqy ] ) , @xmath35 is the remnant mass ( @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 is the fraction of mass converted into the element @xmath2 in a star of mass @xmath41 .    using the above parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and assuming that @xmath9 is proportional to the star formation rate ( @xmath42 ) , equations ( [ basic1])([basic3 ] ) become @xmath43 { \\cal d}_i,\\label{basic6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are , respectively , defined by @xmath47 we can regard @xmath45 and @xmath46 as constant in time (  6.2 and  8.4 of d98 ) .",
    "we note that the galactic value shows @xmath48 ( lf98 ) .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath49 yr , which is consistent with jones et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and jones , tielens , & hollenbach ( 1996 ) .",
    "the relation @xmath50 ( d98 ) leads to @xmath51 .    combining equations ( [ basic5 ] ) and ( [ basic6 ] )",
    ", we obtain the following differential equation of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath10 : @xmath53 { \\cal d}_i-\\frac{\\beta_{\\rm acc}{\\cal d}_i^2}{x_i } , \\label{difeq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the relation , @xmath54 .    here",
    ", we take @xmath3 to compare the result with the data in lf98 . for further quantification",
    ", we need to fix the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the traced element ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the values are given in lf98 .",
    "the reason why lf98 chose oxygen as the tracer is as follows : ( i ) most of oxygen is produced in type ii supernovae which are also responsible for the shock destruction of dust grains ; ( ii ) oxygen is the main constituent of dust grains .",
    "the point ( i ) means that the instantaneous recycling approximation may be a reasonable approximation for the investigation of oxygen abundances , since the generation of oxygen is a massive - star - weighted phenomenon . in other words , results are insensitive to the value of @xmath26 . according to lf98 , we put @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we use a power - law form of the imf : @xmath57 .",
    "the salpeter imf is assumed ; i.e. , @xmath58 ( salpeter 1955 ) . according to lf98 , @xmath59 for the salpeter imf .",
    "after the numerical integration of equation ( [ difeq1 ] ) by the runge - kutta method , we compare the result with observational data of dwarf galaxies in the next section .",
    "to compare the solution of equation ( [ difeq1 ] ) with observational data of dust - to - gas ratio , we make an assumption that total mass of dust is proportional to that of oxygen in the dust phase . in other words , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is assumed to be constant for all galaxies . according to table 2.2 of whittet ( 1992 ) , @xmath62 ( the galactic value ) .",
    "we compare the solution of equation ( [ difeq1 ] ) with the data in lf98 ( see also the references therein ) .",
    "the data sets of nearby dirrs and bcdgs are presented in tables 1 and 2 of lf98 , respectively .",
    "the observed dust - to - gas ratio is defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total masses of dust and h i gas , respectively .",
    "the dust mass is derived from the luminosity densities at the wavelengths of 60 @xmath66 m and 100 @xmath66 m observed by _",
    "iras_. the dust mass derived from the far - infrared emission is about an order of magnitude smaller than the value found from the analysis of the interstellar extinction ( fig .  2 of lf98 ) .",
    "the presence of cold or hot dust , emitting beyond 100 @xmath66 m and below 60 @xmath66 m may be responsible for the discrepancy ( lf98 ) .",
    "thus , we should keep in mind that the dust - to - gas ratio adopted here is underestimated in this context .",
    "however , since we only take into account the h i gas as the gas content and do not consider h@xmath67 gas , the dust - to - gas ratio is overestimated ( by a factor of @xmath68 ) . to sum up",
    ", we should keep in mind the uncertainty of an order of magnitude for the dust - to - gas ratio derived from the observation ( @xmath69 ) .    in the following subsections",
    ", we compare @xmath70 calculated by using equations ( [ difeq1 ] ) and ( [ total ] ) with @xmath69 .",
    "we focus on the two processes of dust formation : one is the condensation of dust from heavy elements ejected by stars , and the other is the accretion onto preexisting dust grains .",
    "the efficiency of the former process is denoted by @xmath71 and that of the latter by @xmath45 .",
    "the latter process is not taken into account in lf98 .",
    "for the dependences of the relation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity on imf , see lf98 and h99 .",
    "we present the dependence of the result on the value of @xmath71 in figure 1a , in which the solid , dotted , and dashed lines show the @xmath70@xmath72 relation for @xmath73 , 0.05 and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "the other parameters are fixed to @xmath17 , @xmath74 , @xmath24 [ i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "figure 1a shows that the larger the efficiency of production of dust from heavy elements is , the larger the dust - to - gas ratio becomes .",
    "the data points represent the relations between @xmath69 and @xmath72 of dirrs and bcdgs in lf98 .",
    "the filled and open squares show the data points of the dirrs and the bcdgs , respectively .    in the limit of @xmath76 ,",
    "the solution reduces to @xmath77 ( see also lf98 . ) this means that @xmath70 scales linearly with @xmath71 for the extremely low metallicity .",
    "thus , @xmath71 can be constrained by low - metal galaxies ( see also h99 ) .",
    "equation ( [ lowlim ] ) means that we can constrain the parameter @xmath71 by examining the relation between @xmath78 ( the fraction of oxygen in the dust phase ) and @xmath72 .",
    "we show this relation in figure 1b .",
    "the parameter adopted for each line is the same as figure 1a .",
    "we also show the data points of the same sample as figure 1a , assuming @xmath79 for all the galaxies to convert @xmath69 into @xmath80 . roughly speaking",
    ", our model predicts that @xmath78 is constant in the range of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "this indicates that the low - metal approximation used to derive equation ( [ lowlim ] ) is applicable to dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus , we can directly constrain the parameter @xmath71 by dwarf galaxies . from the data points in figure 1b ,",
    "we see @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "we note that this range is consistent with the analyses in h99 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind the uncertainty of the data as described above in this section .",
    "we also see from figure 1b that the relation between @xmath80 and @xmath72 becomes nonlinear in the relatively high - metal region ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the behavior of this nonlinear region depends on @xmath45 or @xmath46 (  3.2 ) .",
    "we here investigate the dependence of the solution on @xmath45 , which is proportional to the accretion efficiency of heavy elements onto the preexisting dust grains (  2 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath70@xmath72 relations for various @xmath45 are shown in figure 2a .",
    "we show the cases of @xmath84 ( the solid , dotted , and dashed lines , respectively ) , where the relation @xmath85 is fixed .",
    "the other parameters are set to @xmath86 ( @xmath87 the center of the range constrained in  3.1 ) , @xmath17 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is determined by the lifetime of molecular clouds ( d98 ) .",
    "the value @xmath88 corresponds to the accretion timescale of @xmath89 yr (  2 ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath45 means that the accretion of heavy elements onto dust becomes efficient .",
    "thus , for a fixed value for the metallicity , dust - to - gas ratio increases as @xmath45 increases .",
    "we also present an extreme case of @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( long - dashed line ) . in this case , the accretion onto preexisting dust grains is neglected .",
    "we were not able to reproduce the observational data of nearby spiral galaxies without taking into account the accretion process ( d98 ; h99 ) .",
    "however , the solid and long - dashed lines in figure 2 show that we can not judge whether the accretion process is efficient or not because of the little difference between the results with and without the accretion process .",
    "thus , the basic equations of lf98 , which do not include the term of the accretion were able to explain the observed relation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity .",
    "we note that the accretion process is properly considered in d98 .",
    "the ineffectiveness of the accretion process is understood as follows .",
    "two processes are responsible for the formation of dust in equation ( [ basic3 ] ) ; the dust condensation from the heavy elements ejected by stars and the accretion of the heavy elements onto preexisting dust grains .",
    "the former is expressed as @xmath92 and the latter as @xmath93 ( see eq . [ [ basic3 ] ] ) .",
    "we define the following ratio , @xmath94 : @xmath95 if @xmath96 , the accretion process is ineffective compared with the dust condensation process .",
    "we will show that @xmath96 for the sample dwarf galaxies .    using the instantaneous recycling approximation ,",
    "@xmath94 is estimated as @xmath97 now we put @xmath3 . in figure 2b",
    ", we present the relation between @xmath98 and @xmath72 .",
    "the values of parameters for each line is the same as figure 2a .",
    "this figure shows that we can consider that @xmath99 . moreover , in the range in which we are interested here , @xmath100 ( eq . [ [ lowlim ] ] ) , and @xmath101 ( as long as @xmath102 is satisfied ) .",
    "thus , @xmath103 can be approximated by @xmath104 if we put @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107 for the condition @xmath108 .",
    "this is consistent with figure 2b , since the difference between the solid and the long - dashed lines is clear for @xmath83 .",
    "thus , if @xmath83 is satisfied , the dust accretion process is more ineffective than the dust condensation process . actually , even for @xmath109 , the difference is within the typical error of the observed values .",
    "the ineffectiveness of the accretion process results from the low metallicity .",
    "thus , in galaxies with high metallicity , the accretion process becomes important .",
    "indeed , d98 and h99 showed that the process is effective in spiral galaxies , whose metallicity is much larger than the dwarf galaxies ( h99 ) .",
    "since we can reproduce the relation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity of dwarf galaxies without considering the accretion process , d98 suggested that the accretion process is not efficient in dwarf galaxies because of the lack of dense molecular clouds .",
    "this may be true , but seeing that dirrs and bcdgs show high star formation efficiency ( sage et al .",
    "1992 ; israel , bontekoe , & kester 1996 ) , there may be a large amount of dense molecular gas in dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "indeed , we have shown in figure 2 that the observed relation can be explained even if the efficiency of the accretion process @xmath45 is as high as that in the spiral galaxies considered in h99 .",
    "based on the models proposed by lf98 and d98 , we have examined the dust content in dirrs and bcdgs .",
    "the basic equations which describes the changing rate of dust - to - gas ratio include the terms of dust formation from heavy elements ejected by stars , destruction by supernova shocks , destruction in star - forming regions and accretion of elements onto preexisting dust grains (  2 ) .",
    "this accretion process is important in molecular clouds , where gas densities are generally high .",
    "the results are compared with the observed values of dirrs and bcdgs . though the degeneration of the parameter and observational error makes it impossible to determine each of the parameter precisely ,",
    "we were able to constrain the parameters to some extent .    the efficiency of dust production from heavy element ( denoted by @xmath15 ) can be constrained by the galaxies with low metallicity (  3.1 ) .",
    "the reasonable range is @xmath110 , which is consistent with h99 .",
    "thus , it is possible to understand the dust amount in dwarf systems as well as that in spiral systems through the model in this paper .    as for the nearby spiral galaxies",
    ", unless we take into account the accretion process of heavy element onto the preexisting dust particles , we can not explain the observed relation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity ( d98 ; h99 ) .",
    "for the dwarf galaxies , however , we can explain the data without the accretion process (  3.2 ) .",
    "this means that the accretion is not effective for dwarf galaxies .",
    "even if the efficiency of the accretion @xmath45 , determined by the lifetimes of molecular clouds ( d98 ) , is as high as that in spiral galaxies , the accretion is not effective because of the low metallicity in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can not attribute the ineffectiveness of the dust accretion process to the lack of molecular clouds .",
    "finally , we note that our model have satisfied one condition which any model must fulfill : the model has to explain the observation of _ nearby _ galaxies .",
    "then , it becomes a matter of concern whether our model can explain the galaxies in the high - redshift universe . for theoretical modeling of the cosmic dust mass ,",
    "see , e.g. , edmunds & phillipps ( 1997 ) .",
    "observationally , it is interesting that high - redshift galaxies found recently have evidences of dust extinction ( soifer et al .",
    "1998 ; armus et al .",
    "the number count of galaxies in the far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths , where dust reprocesses stellar light , is another interesting theme concerning high - redshift dust ( e.g. , takeuchi et al . 1999 ) .",
