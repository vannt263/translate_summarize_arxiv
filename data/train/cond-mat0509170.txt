    "what is more remarkable is that the electronic states in these systems can be precisely controlled via the external voltages @xcite .",
    "magneto - optical studies of parabolic quantum dots ( described as _ artificial atoms _ @xcite by us in 1990 ) have been intensely explored for more than a decade @xcite in order to understand its unique electronic and optical properties and as promising candidates for optoelectronic devices , applications in optical quantum information technology , etc .",
    "@xcite . as a result of these studies , a very good theoretical and experimental understanding of the single - electron states in the dot",
    "has already been achieved . at the most basic level ,",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation for an electron confined by a harmonic potential , @xmath0 , @xmath1 is the confinement potential strength , in the presence of an external perpendicular magnetic field is well known since the beginning of quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "dipole - allowed transitions among these energy levels will have energies @xcite @xmath7 this relation has been verified to great accuracy by a variety of experiments @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , the observed magnetic field dependent fir absorption in quantum dots containing more than one electron was found to be essentially _ independent _ of the number of electrons confined and instead was dominated by the above relation for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it was a rather puzzling result because according to this , magneto - optics was clearly incapable of providing any relevant information about the effect of mutual interactions of the confined electrons .",
    "the puzzle was later resolved by maksym and chakraborty @xcite , who pointed out that for a parabolic qd in an external magnetic field , the dipole interaction is a function of the center - of - mass ( cm ) coordinate alone and the inter - electron interaction does not play any role . despite this somewhat disappointing performance of a parabolic dot ,",
    "fir spectroscopy of qds ( parabolic or otherwise ) has generated enormous interest for over a decade that is yet to subside @xcite . in this paper",
    "we include another interesting element into the problem , the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction .",
    "we demonstrate here that in the presence of spin - orbit coupling the magneto - optical transitions show many new and interesting features that can be tuned by the so coupling . based on these results",
    ", we propose that magneto - optical transitions are best suited to determine optically the unique effect of so coupling in quantum dots described below @xcite .",
    "interest on the role of the spin - orbit coupling in nanostructured systems is now at its peak , due largely to its relevance to spin transport in low - dimensional electron channels @xcite .",
    "the intriguing possibility of tuning the so field and thereby coherently manipulate electron spins in quantum dots has sparked major activities in the past years @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that an improved understanding of spin dynamics in the qds might pave the way for future electronic and information processing , especially in quantum computing and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "spin degree of freedom is perhaps more advantageous than charge because unlike charge , spin is not coupled to electromagnetic noise and therefore have much longer coherence time @xcite .",
    "improved knowledge of the influence of spin - orbit coupling in quantum dots is therefore quite essential in this pursuit .",
    "while the majority of experimental efforts has focused on magneto - transport measurements @xcite , here we present the results for the optical absorption spectra that are experimentally observable and could , in principle , provide an important probe of so coupling in few - electron quantum dots .    the spin - orbit interaction in semiconductor heterostructures",
    "can be caused by an electric field perpendicular to the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "riding on an electron , this electric field will be _ felt _ as an effective magnetic field lying in the plane of the 2deg , perpendicular to the wave vector @xmath9 of the electron .",
    "the effective zeeman interaction of the electron spin with the field lifts the spin degeneracy ( internal zeeman effect ) .",
    "this is usually referred to in the literature as the bychkov - rashba mechanism .",
    "this results in an isotropic spin splitting energy @xmath10 at @xmath11 proportional to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "let us consider an electron in the 2deg moving with a velocity @xmath12 in the presence of an electric field @xmath13 . in the rest frame of the electron ,",
    "this transforms ( relativistically ) into an effective magnetic field @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the speed of light .",
    "the magnetic moment of the electron will then couple to @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting spin - orbit interaction is , @xmath17 since , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath20 where the electric field is aligned along the @xmath21 axis .",
    "alternatively , a general spin - orbit hamiltonian that stems directly from the quadratic in @xmath22 expansion of the dirac equation is @xcite @xmath23 the electric field associated with @xmath24 is @xmath25 , and is directed along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 is then identical to that in eq .   ( [ original ] ) . an important point to note here",
    "is that a non - vanishing gradient in eq .",
    "( [ gradient ] ) requires that the system must have inversion asymmetry . in the present case that arises from the structural inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction that we are here concerned with is therefore described by the hamiltonian @xmath28 where the @xmath21 axis is chosen perpendicular to the 2deg ( in the @xmath29-plane ) , @xmath30 is the spin - orbit coupling constant , which is sample dependent and is proportional to the interface electric field that confines the electrons in the @xmath31 plane , @xmath32 denotes the pauli matrices , and @xmath33 is the planar wave vector .",
    "this is the bychkov - rashba hamiltonian @xcite that has been receiving of late rather widespread attention @xcite .",
    "the single - electron hamiltonian for the 2deg including the bychkov - rashba term has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    since the operators",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 commute with the hamiltonian , we can search for @xmath39 eigenstates of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( spin up ) or @xmath42 ( spin down ) .",
    "solutions of @xmath43 are readily obtained as @xmath44    the energy dispersion then consists of two branches @xmath45 with an energy separation @xmath46 for a given @xmath9 .",
    "the spin parts of the wave functions @xmath47 are mutually orthogonal and @xmath48 therefore in the states @xmath49 the spins of the electrons lie in the @xmath29-plane and point in opposite directions . in addition , @xmath50 i.e. , the spins are _ perpendicular _ to the momentum @xmath51 . spatial alignment of spins therefore depends on the wave vector @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface is a pair of concentric circles with radii @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the present paper",
    ", we are dealing with systems having rotational symmetry .",
    "the formalism in that case is derived in detail in sect.ii .",
    "several experimental groups @xcite investigating the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations in a 2deg confined at the heterojunctions with a narrow - gap quantum well ( e.g. , ingaas / inalas , inas / gasb , etc . ) have already established that lifting of spin degeneracy results from inversion asymmetry of the structure which invokes an electric field perpendicular to the layer .",
    "experimentally observed values of the so coupling strength @xmath30 lie in the range of 5  45 mev.nm @xcite .",
    "energy levels of two interacting electrons confined in a parabolic quantum dot in an external magnetic field were recently reported by us for this range of so coupling strength @xcite . in the absence of so coupling , electron - electron interaction causes the ground state energy to jump from one angular momentum value to another as the magnetic field is increased @xcite .",

    "it is usefull to relabel our spinors .",
    "for example , for non - negative values of @xmath86 we set @xmath87    the minimization of @xmath88 leads now to the diagonalization of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix @xmath89 with diagonal @xmath90 and subdiagonal @xmath91    the diagonalization yields a set of solutions : the set @xmath92 of eigenvalues and the set @xmath93 of eigenvectors indexed by the particular solution @xmath9 and the fixed angular momentum @xmath86 .",

    "the dipole - allowed optical transitions are always between the same spin states , but the angular momenta must differ by unity . in the presence of so coupling , neither the dipole operator nor the selection rule changes , but",
    "the so interaction mixes the neighboring angular momentum values ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) as well as the spin and hence the selection rule now applies to the total angular momentum @xmath130 as well .",

    "[ fig : optics1 ]  [ fig : optics3 ] .    as compared to the fock - darwin spectra of quantum dots without the so coupling ( shown in panels figs .",
    "[ fig : fock1 ]  [ fig : fock3 ] [ a ] ) the most outstanding features in the energy spectra of quantum dots with so coupling are the _ lifting of degeneracy _ at zero magnetic field , the rearrangement of some of the levels at small fields and level repulsions at higher magnetic fields .",
    "to get some insight into the mechanism causing this kind of behavior , let us have a closer look , as an example , at the energy levels involved in the lowest absorption lines of the inas dot [ curves labelled `` 0 ''  `` 3 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : fock1 ] ( a ) ] .",
    ".schematic spinors corresponding to four fock - darwin levels , marked 0  3 in fig .",

    "[ cols=\">,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    in the absence of the so coupling energies of these levels are given by the formula ( [ nunm ] ) .",
    "the corresponding spinors ( schematic ) are depicted in table [ spinortable ] , where the numbers in the first column refer to the labels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fock1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the spinors for electrons with negative and positive lande @xmath60-factors are shown in the middle and third columns respectively . in actual physical systems , conventionally only the spinors with @xmath137 are of any interest .",
    "the spinor states of electrons on lines 0 and 1 of fig .",
    "[ fig : fock1 ] ( a ) differ only by the orientation of the spin : on line 0 the spin is parallel to the magnetic field ( @xmath138 ) while on line 1 the spin is antiparallel to the field .",
    "thus the energy difference between these states is the zeemen splitting .",
    "the total single - particle angular momenta ( [ spartj ] ) are correspondingly @xmath139 .",
    "since under the so coupling @xmath140 is a good quantum number these two states will never mix even when the so coupling is on . when the coupling strength @xmath30 increases , the higher lying states with @xmath141 couple to the state 0 as well as states with @xmath142 couple with the state 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fock1 ] this shows up as an increasing splitting of the lines 0 and 1 when going through the panels from [ a ] to [ d ] .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the mixing has very minor effect on the ground state since the other states with @xmath141 are energetically very far from that .     [ a ] , @xmath143 [ b ] , @xmath144 [ c ] , and @xmath145 [ d ] . ]    turning now our attention to electrons on lines 1 and 2 we see from the table [ spinortable ] ( column @xmath137 ) that their spinor states both have the same angular momentum @xmath146 .",
    "consequently the so interaction can mix these states .",
    "the mixing is particularly pronounced when the states are nearly degenerate , i.e. in the vicinity of the crossing point of lines 1 and 2 . at moderate coupling strengths this mixing leads to level repulsions as shown in panels [ b ] and [ c ] .",
    "when the coupling is very strong , energetically higher states with @xmath142 also become important in the mixing , leading to the imperceptibility of the level repulsion in panel [ d ] .",
    "[ a ] , @xmath143 [ b ] , @xmath144 [ c ] , and @xmath145 [ d ] . ]",
    "we also mentioned lifting of degeneracies and rearrangements of energy levels as features of the so coupling under small magnetic fields .",
    "since we are interested in the absorption the most important states for us are the ones which can be reached from the ground state ( @xmath141 ) respecting the dipole transition selection rule @xmath147 .",
    "these are the lowest states with @xmath142 and @xmath148 corresponding to the lines 2 and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fock1 ] ( a ) and to the spionrs 2 and 3 ( with @xmath137 ) in table [ spinortable ] , respectively , for vanishing so coupling . since as the so interaction is stronger the larger is the ( angular ) momentum of the electron , the spinor 3 possessing maximum orbital angular momentum 2 is affected more than the spinor 2",
    "hence , although the energies of both spinors are decreased by the so coupling the effect on the spinor 3 is larger .     [ a ] , @xmath143 [ b ] , @xmath144 [ c ] , and @xmath145 [ d ] . ]    keeping the above discusssions in mind it is now easy to interpret the features introduced by the so coupling into the absorption spectra [ figs .",
    "( [ fig : optics1 ]  [ fig : optics3 ] ) ] .",
    "firstly , although the lower absorption branch consists mainly of transitions from the state 0 to the state 2 it shows an anticrossing at moderate coupling strengths . this is a direct consequence of the mixing of the spinor states 1 and 2 which results in two spinors , both with nonzero upper component .",
    "thus we can see transitions from the ground state 0 to both of these .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned earlier the level repulsion between states 1 and 2 resumes the form of level crossing when the so interaction becomes very strong .",
    "this causes the anticrossing in the absorption spectra to disappear . in the inas dot",
    "this happens already at @xmath145 while in the insb dot the anticrossing still persists .",
    "since the lande @xmath60-factor of gaas is very small the zeeman split state 1 does not meet the state 2 within the range of the magnetic field under consideration .",
    "consequently we see at the lower right corners of fig .",
    "[ fig : optics3 ] ( b )  ( d ) only the beginnings of the lower branches of these anticrossings .    secondly , the upper absorption branch corresponds mainly to transitions from the state 0 to the state 3 modified by the so coupling .",
    "the small magnetic field however makes an exception . as we discussed above , at small fields",
    "the state 3 is energetically lower than the state 2 due to the so interaction .",
    "thus we get a crossing of spectra at small fields .    from eq .",
    "( [ nunm ] ) , the separation between the states 2 and 3 , and hence also the gap between the absorption line branches is roughly proportional to the cyclotron frequency @xmath6 which in turn is linearly proportional to the magnetic field and inversely proportional to the effective mass of the electron .",
    "thus , due to the very small effective mass of the electron in an insb dot the energy of the spinor 3 exceeds the energy of the spinor 2 already at very small magnetic fields .",
    "consequently also the crossing of absorption lines of an insb dot occurs at very small magnetic fields as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : optics2 ] ( b)-(d ) .    at this point",
    "it may be worth mentioning that the energetics of the single - electron quantum dot under the influence of the so coupling and subjected to an external magnetic field depends strongly on the sign of the lande @xmath60-factor .",
    "this is contrary to the case without so coupling where the energy spectrum is independent on the sign of @xmath60 although , of course , the orientation of spin is determined by it .",
    "let us consider , for example , the lowest absorption branch in the case @xmath149 . from table",
    "[ spinortable ] we can deduce that also in this case the transitions mainly take the spinor 0 to the spinor 2 . now , however , there is no spinor level which would cross or even come close to the energy of the state 2 and mix with it .",
    "consequently the anticrossing described above would not be observable in this case .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the energy levels and optical absorption spectra in a non - interacting qd in a magnetic field and in the presence of so interaction . in what follows",
    ", we describe the theory for a interacting few - electron parabolic quantum dot .",
    "the basis @xmath150 for @xmath98 interacting electrons in a qd is constructed as a direct antisymmetrized product of single - particle basis @xmath151 ( [ spbas ] ) of the form @xmath152 where @xmath153 stands for the antisymmetrization operator .",
    "it is also understood that the notations such as @xmath154 represent the antisymmetrized direct products , i.e. , @xmath155 . \\label{asdirprod}\\ ] ] usually it is possible to restrict the size of @xmath150 using the conservation laws .",
    "for example , in a rotationally invariant system the total angular momentum is a good quantum number .",
    "therefore , for example , we fix it to @xmath130 , and accept into the basis only those states that satisfy @xmath156    the states of the interacting system are expressed as superposition of the non - interacting states taken from the basis set ( [ mpbas ] ) @xmath157 to extract the coefficients @xmath158 , we again resort to the minimization , i.e. we minimize the rayleigh quotient @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the total many - body hamiltonian .",
    "again this leads to the diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix with elements @xmath161 .",
    "the eigenvectors are the desired expansion coefficients and the eigenvalues the corresponding energies of the interacting system",
    ". it will be clear from the appendix that both these tasks , construction of the hamiltonian matrix and its diagonalization are numerically quite challenging .",
    "we write the total hamiltonian @xmath160 as a sum of the single - particle operators ( [ spham ] ) and two - body operators @xmath162 as @xmath163 since our basis states @xmath164 are diagonal by construction in @xmath126 we only need to evaluate the matrix elements of the latter sum in ( [ totham ] ) .",
    "our many - body states @xmath164 are expressed in occupation representation language ( [ asdirprod ] ) , and therefore it is natural to proceed in the occupation number space .",
    "this means that for the interaction part we have to evaluate the two - body terms @xmath165 in our system the mutual interaction between the electrons is taken to be purely coulombic , i.e. @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the effective dielectric constant of the material .",
    "the interaction operator is thus diagonal in spin . recalling that our single - particle states @xmath103 were two - component spinors ( [ spinordef ] ) , the two - body term ( [ twbterm ] ) consists of sum of four terms and is of the form @xmath168 where the summation indices take values @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "furthermore , since we expressed the spatial components @xmath171 as superpositions of functions @xmath172 [ eq .  ( [ gnmexp ] ) ] , @xmath173 we are ultimately led to evaluate the coulomb matrix elements in the oscillator wavefunction @xmath174 basis .",

    "is the appearance of discontinuities , anticrossings and new modes in addition to the two main ( @xmath77 ) absorption lines .",
    "these optical signatures of the so interaction are consequences of the multitude of level crossings and level repulsions that occur in the energy spectra ( figs .",
    "[ fig : e2_inas ] , [ fig : e3_inas ] , and [ fig : e4_inas ] ) . the latter ones can be attributed to an interplay between the so and zeeman couplings . in order to understand their origin ,",
    "let us first examine the case of the two - electron system ( figs .",
    "[ fig : e2_inas],[fig : oa2_inas ] ) . in our spinor notation",
    "the main contribution to the ground state at zero magnetic field comes from the two - electron state @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is a spinor with @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 a spinor with @xmath184 and @xmath185 , i.e. , both electrons have zero orbital angular momenta with opposite spins ( corresponding to the spinors 0 and 1 in table [ spinortable ] with @xmath186 ) .",
    "when we increase the magnetic field the spin triplet configuration will become , due to the interaction , energetically more favorable .",
    "if the lande @xmath60-factor is negative then the electrons would like to occupy states with orbital angular momenta 0 and @xmath187 with both spins up ( i.e. , states 0 and 2 of table [ spinortable ] ) . in the spinor picture",
    "this means that @xmath183 still has @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) but now @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the so interaction mixes these two configurations which results in a level repulsion . on the other hand , when the strength of the so coupling is further increased , the relative significance of the zeeman contribution to @xmath126 decreases .",
    "the energy shifts to states with @xmath192 will then become energetically feasible and we again have crossings of levels . for increasing number of electrons in the dot , the energy spectra is more dense and exhibit additional level crossings ( figs .",
    "[ fig : e3_inas ]  [ fig : oa4_inas ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the ground state angular momentum also changes more frequently as compared to that of the two - electron case .",
    "it should be pointed out that in many - electron dots these level crossings and repulsion are to be attributed , at least partly to the mutual coulomb interactions .",
    "the level crossings / repulsions we saw earlier [ e.g. levels 1 and 2 in fig .  [ fig : fock1 ] ( a ) ] in the single - particle particle picture are due to the zeeman splitting whereas in interacting systems crossings occur even in the limit of vanishing zeeman coupling . in the present inas dot the coulomb interaction brings , for example the singlet - triplet transition to much lower magnetic field ( @xmath193 t ) as compared to the field required in a noninteracting system ( @xmath194 t ) .    , but for a four - electron insb quantum dot . ]    at moderate so coupling strengths the absorption spectra do not essentially differ from the single - particle spectrum .",
    "but when the coupling strength increases the deviation from the pure parabolic confinement also increases which in turn implies that the lowest final states of dipole allowed transitions are not any more achievable by adding @xmath195 to the initial state energies . in particular , this results in discontinuities and anticrossing behaviors as well as appearence of new modes . as an illustration ,",
    "let us consider the absorptions that at a magnetic field of @xmath196 t take the two - electron system from the ground state to excited states . in the absence of the so coupling the ground state",
    "is a spin - singlet state @xmath197 with total angular momentum @xmath189 .",
    "according to the dipole selection rules absorptions cause transitions to states @xmath198 and @xmath199 with energies @xmath200 above the ground state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oa2_inas ] ( d ) , we note that in addition to the two main lines there are now two additional lines ( at around @xmath196 t ) of appreciable intensity at the so coupling strength @xmath145 ( mev.nm ) .",
    "further analysis reveals that the ground states still have @xmath189 and that the expectation value of the spin @xmath21-component is @xmath201 .",
    "the excited states also have @xmath198 , as before .",
    "however , the final spin states can no longer be classified as singlets : the expectation values @xmath202 vary between @xmath203 and 0.39 .",
    "when the number of electrons increases the number of these additional modes also increases but at the same time the relative intensities decrease ( at each @xmath204 we have normalized the total intensity to unity ) . on the other hand , the discontinuities as consequences of deviations from a parabolic confinement",
    "become more pronounced ( figs .",
    "[ fig : e3_inas ]  [ fig : oa4_inas ] ) .",
    "this is because there are higher angular momenta involved in the dipole transitions . as a consequence of this the upper absorption branch now exhibits a rich structure while in the single - particle picture it is practically featureless .",
    "as mentioned above , in addition to the inas quantum dots , investigation of insb quantum dots are also thought to be interesting , particularly in the context of so coupling effects due to the large values of @xmath205 and @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "a clear difference is the almost total absence of anticrossings and discontinuities .",
    "this is partly due to the very large zeeman coupling which practically nullifies the so interaction at the coupling strengths @xmath30 we are concerned with .",
    "another reason is the large kinetic energies due to the very small electron effective mass . because the strength of the coulomb interaction is somewhat smaller than in inas ( @xmath206 ) correlations caused by the mutual electronic interactions are effectively much smaller in insb than in inas . for the exploration of the so coupling via absorption spectroscopy",

    "we present a brief discussion about the numerical method that we believe the most accurate ( and appropriate ) for that task . while in principle , evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ coulelsum ] ) is straightforward it turns out to be numerically highly unstable , primarily due to the expansion ( [ gnmexp ] ) extending to laguerre polynomials of large degree and large angular momenta which in turn , leads to large terms of alternating sign @xcite .",
    "a remedy for this is to employ multiple precision arithmetics such as , for example implemented in the gnu arbitrary precision gmp library .",
    "however , if we apply multiple precision arithmetic directly into the sixfold summation ( [ coulelsum ] ) the time consumed to evaluate these becomes insurmountable . to circumvent this obstacle",
    "we note that many terms in the sums actually depend on very few parameters , the range of these parameters is restricted and the same functional forms repeat themselves . thus a natural solution is to tabulate these forms and the subsums . in our coulomb matrix element code",
    "we used the tabulated functions @xmath211 now the summations @xmath212 in the expression ( [ coulelsum ] ) can be written as @xmath213 although the summation here is still fourfold it is nevertheless several orders of magnitude faster than the original one ( [ coulelsum ] ) and as such fast enough for our purposes .    under the influence of the so",
    "coupling the total spin @xmath214 of our many - electron system is not a conserved quantity . as a consequence of this we can not fix the total @xmath215 of the many - body basis",
    "this degree of freedom tends to make the number of non - interacting many - body states of the basis very large even for a small number of electrons , and even if the conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath216 is taken into account .",
    "for example , to achieve a convergence for a four electron system in the parabolic confinement with harmonic potential ( @xmath217 ) of few mev the size of the basis must be _ of the order of a million_. furthermore , since we want to study properties of the eigenstates , such as polarization and dipole matrix elements between states , we also need the relevant eigenvectors .",
    "clearly the sheer size of the matrix prohibits a full diagonalization and we have to resort to an iterative scheme aimed to search a given number of energetically lowest eigenvectors . of course the algorithm should be fast and hopefully also robust .    the algorithm proposed by davidson and liu ( dl ) to evaluate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of `` monster matrices ''",
    "@xcite seem to fit our criteria . like any other iterative method it transforms the diagonalization of a matrix @xmath218 to minimization of the rayleigh quotient @xmath219 where @xmath220 represents the column vector of the coefficients in the superposition of the basis states . also , as in many other methods , the only operations involving the matrix @xmath218 are vector multiplications .",
    "this allows us to exploit fully the sparseness of @xmath218 , i.e. we have to store only the non - zero elements .",
    "the key idea behind practically any iterative method subjecting the matrix only to multiplication is to search the minimum of the quotient ( [ minprinc ] ) in a ( very small ) subspace and to update this subspace in each iteration step .",
    "how this updating is performed depends on the method . for example , in the common conjugate gradient method the subspace is two - dimensional and spanned by the gradient @xmath60 at current position @xmath220 and a vector @xmath221 conjugate to it with respect to @xmath218 ( i.e. @xmath222 ) .    in",

    "suppose that at a given step our search space @xmath223 is spanned by the orthonormal vectors @xmath224 ( the dimension @xmath225 must , of course , be greater than the number of required eigenstates ) .",
    "finding the minimum of ( [ minprinc ] ) in this subspace corresponds to the diagonalization of the @xmath226 matrix @xmath227 ( we take @xmath223 to represent also the matrix with columns @xmath228 ) . as a result",
    "we get @xmath225 eigenvalues @xmath229 and @xmath225 eigenvectors @xmath230 , each of dimension @xmath225 .",
    "the expanded vectors @xmath231 will approximate the eigenvectors and the quantities @xmath229 the eigenvalues we are seeking for .",
    "the next task in the iteration step is to update the subspace @xmath223 . for that purpose",
    "we pick up a certain number ( a parameter depending for example on the size of the computer memory ) of the residuals @xmath232 with largest norms .",
    "the selected residuals are orthonormalized with respect to the space @xmath223 and then appended to it .",
    "so , in each step the dimension of the search space and the size required to store it increases and we may eventually exhaust all the memory . at this point",
    "we compress the space @xmath223 to its bare minimum comprising only as many vectors as we are required to find .",
    "these vectors are selected from the set @xmath233 and are the ones with smallest @xmath229 .",

    "<S> we report on the electronic properties of few interacting electrons confined in a parabolic quantum dot based on a theoretical approach developed to investigate the influence of bychkov - rashba spin - orbit ( so ) interaction on such a system . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the spin - orbit coupling profoundly influences the energy spectrum of interacting electrons in a quantum dot . here </S>",
    "<S> we present accurate results for the energy levels and optical - absorption spectra for parabolic quantum dots containing upto four interacting electrons , in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and under the influence of an externally applied , perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we have described in detail about a very accurate numerical scheme to evaluate these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we have evaluated the effects of so coupling on the fock - darwin spectra for quantum dots made out of three different semiconductor systems , inas , insb , and gaas . </S>",
    "<S> the so coupling on the single - electron spectra manifests itself by primarily lifting of the degeneracy at zero magnetic field , rearrangement of some of the energy levels at small magnetic fields , and level repulsions at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> these are explained as due to mixing of different spinor states for increasing strength of so coupling . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding absorption spectra reveal anticrossing structures in the two main lines of the spectra . for the interacting many - electron systems we observed the appearence of discontinuities , anticrossings , and new modes that appear in conjunction with the two main absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> these additional features arise entirely due to the so coupling and are a consequence of level crossings and level repulsions in the energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> an intricate interplay between the so coupling and the zeeman energies are shown to be responsible for these new features seen in the energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> optical absorption spectra for all three types of quantum dots studied here show a common feature : new modes appear , mostly near the upper main branch of the spectra around 2 tesla that become stronger with increasing so coupling strength . among the three types of systems considered here , </S>",
    "<S> optical signatures of the so interaction is found to be the strongest in the absorption spectra of the gaas quantum dot , but only at very large values of the so coupling strength , and appears to be the weakest for the insb quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> experimental observation of these new modes that appear solely due to the presence of so coupling would provide a rare glimpse on the role of so coupling in nanostructured quantum systems .    </S>",
