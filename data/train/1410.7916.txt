    "<S> the first principles calculation has assigned the phonon modes at 3 mev as the optical modes of zn atoms located at the middle of two la atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy vibration of the zn atom perpendicular to the three - fold axis is thought to lead the structural instability of laru@xmath0zn@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> caged compounds such as intermetallic clathrates , filled skutterudites , and @xmath10-pyrochlore oxides have attracted much attention in recent years , since a variety of interesting physical phenomena arise from large - amplitude and anharmonic vibration of guest atoms inside the cages @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy optical phonons in the intermetallic clathrates and filled skutterudites reduce the thermal conductivity and thus enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such guest phonon modes in rare - earth filled - skutterudites are thought to play an important role in strongly correlated electronic phenomena such as heavy fermion state , superconductivity , and quadrupolar fluctuations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a family of @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14@xmath1 ( @xmath11 : rare earth , @xmath12 : transition metal , @xmath14=al and zn ) is another class of caged compounds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they show various physical properties such as structural transition , superconductivity , heavy fermion state , and multipolar ordering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , ybco@xmath0zn@xmath1 has the largest electronic specific heat coefficient of 8 j / k@xmath15 mol among the yb - based compounds  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the atomic displacement parameter of the zn atom at the 16@xmath24 site , zn ( 16@xmath24 ) , is approximately twice or three times larger than those of other atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a first principles calculation of la@xmath18zn@xmath1 ( @xmath12=ru and ir ) has pointed out that the zn ( 16@xmath24 ) vibrates at low frequencies in a two - dimensional plane , which probably induces the structural transition  @xcite . the zn ( 16@xmath24 ) </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , @xmath29la - nmr measurements of la@xmath18zn@xmath1 ( @xmath12=ru and ir ) have indicated that zn ( 16@xmath24 ) moves from the 16@xmath24 site to off - center positions on cooling below @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that the low - energy zn vibration plays a role in the structural transition  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> specific heat and inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) measurements are powerful techniques to observe low - energy optical phonon modes in solids . </S>",

    "<S> combining them , the lattice specific heat can be reproduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the combinations of specific heat , ixs , and inelastic neutron scattering measurements were usefull to reveal anharmonic vibration of the guest atoms in intermetallic - clathrates , filled - skutterudites , and the @xmath10-pyrochlore oxides  @xcite .    in the present work , we have measured the specific heat and the ixs spectra for laru@xmath0zn@xmath1 to observe the low - energy optical phonon modes . </S>",
