    "in the recent paper @xcite we have considered the hamiltonian formalism for fluid and gas based on the lagrangian description . it was pointed out in this paper that apart from other advantages , the lagrangian description , which uses the trajectories of the particles of fluid ( gas ) as the dynamical variables , is the most convenient for the introduction of interaction . in particular",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite how the introduction of the electromagnetic interaction of particles which constitute the fluid , provide us with the theory of plasma . in the present paper we are going to consider in analogous way the theory of gas of particles which interact with each other through gravitational newton potential .",
    "the system of such particles could be considered as a model for the motion of stars in a galaxy when the gravitation interaction prevails all other interaction .",
    "the total number of stars in typical galaxy is of the order of @xmath0 , so it may be reasonable to consider this collection of `` particles '' as a gas .    the simplest model , which is usually used for numerical simulation of n - body model of galaxy is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 are canonical coordinates of particles ( stars ) with masses @xmath3 . the model we are going to consider is based on the dynamics described by @xmath4 with the assumption @xmath5 , when @xmath6 . for this limit",
    "there appears a natural desire to consider a continuos distribution of the particles as it is done in the theory of fluid or gas @xcite .",
    "apparently , the attractive potential provided by gravity will produce essential difference of the properties of such a media .",
    "the potential part of the energy will produce a collapse , which will be prevented by kinetic term .",
    "such a competition sometimes results in a creation of the steady solution  a soliton .",
    "it is important to mention here that the solitons in gas and fluid is intrinsically different with e.g. single solitons considered in particle physics . in the case of fluid or gas only the field of density and velocities",
    "are time independent , while the constituents of the media are moving .",
    "the simplest example of such a soliton is a tornado .",
    "in fluid ( gas ) mechanics there are two different pictures of description . the first , usually refereed as eulerian , uses as",
    "the coordinates the space dependent fields of velocity and density .",
    "the second , lagrangian description , uses the coordinates of the particles @xmath7 labeled by the set of the parameters @xmath8 , which could be considered as the initial positions @xmath9 and time @xmath10 .",
    "these initial positions @xmath11 as well , as the coordinates @xmath7 belong to some domain @xmath12 . in sequel",
    "we shall consider only conservative systems , where the paths of different particles do not cross , therefore it is clear that the functions @xmath7 define a diffeomorphism of @xmath12 and the inverse functions @xmath13 should also exist .",
    "@xmath14 the density of the particles in space at time @xmath10 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the initial density at time @xmath17 .",
    "the velocity field @xmath18 as a function of coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath10 is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inverse function ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the velocity also could be written in the following form : @xmath22 or @xmath23 let us calculate the time derivative of the density using its definition ( [ 2 ] ) : @xmath24 in such a way we verify the continuity equation of fluid dynamics : @xmath25 .    using the coordinates",
    "@xmath7 as a configurational variables we can consider the simplest motion of the fluid described by the lagrangian @xmath26 the equations of motion which follow from ( [ 8 ] ) apparently are @xmath27 now let us find what does this equation mean for the density and velocity of the fluid . for that we shall differentiate both sides of ( [ 5 ] ) with respect to time @xmath28 the first term in the r.h.s . of ( [ 10 ] ) vanishes due to the equations of motion([9 ] ) and transforming the second in the same way , as we did in ( [ 6 ] ) we arrive at @xmath29 let us rewrite ( [ 11 ] ) in the following form : @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\rho(x_i , t)\\bigl[\\dot{\\vec v}(x_i , t)+v_k(x_i , t)\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k } \\vec v ( x_i , t)\\bigr]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in ( [ 12 ] ) vanishes due to the continuity equation , while the second gives euler s equation in the case of the free flow : @xmath31 in order to get the usual euler equations for fluid or gas with the internal pressure we need to add to the lagrangian ( [ 8 ] ) the `` potential '' part , as it has been shown in @xcite .",
    "this `` potential '' part describes the repulsive interaction between particles which constitute the media ( gas or fluid ) . as was announced in * introduction * , we are going to introduce another interaction  gravitational attraction between particles .",
    "for that we have to modify the lagrangian ( [ 8 ] ) in the following way : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the gravitational constant . the equations of motion , which follow from the lagrangian ( [ 14 ] )",
    "have the form : @xmath34 translating equation ( [ 15 ] ) on to the language of euler variables , as has been done above we arrive at the following set , including the continuity equation : @xmath35 note that the r.h.s of the equation ( 16 ) in the case of ordinary gas or fluid is expressed through the internal pressure @xmath36 ; @xmath37 the set ( 16),(17 ) defines the evolution of initial distribution of @xmath38 of gravitating gas and , besides it could be used to find the static configuration of this gas for different boundary conditions .",
    "in particular we can explore the possibility of the existence of the static isolated configurations of gravitating gas .",
    "isolation here means that density @xmath39 vanishes at infinity .",
    "note , that for usual fluid , gas or plasma these kind of solutions are forbidden due to virial arguments , known in the case of plasma as shafranov s theorem @xcite,@xcite . for the gas , describing by equation ( [ 18 ] )",
    "this theorem could be proven as follows .",
    "first , using the continuity equation let us rewrite equation ( [ 18 ] ) for static case in the following form : @xmath40=0.\\ ] ] integrating ( [ 19 ] ) with @xmath41 over @xmath42 we obtain : @xmath43=\\\\ \\nonumber & \\int d^3 x \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}\\biggl(x_j\\biggl[\\rho(x_i)v_k(x_i)v_j(x_j)+\\delta_{jk}p(x_i \\biggr ] \\biggr)-\\\\ \\nonumber & \\int d^3 x \\delta_{jk}\\biggl[\\rho(x_i)v_k(x_i)v_j(x_j)+\\delta_{jk}p(x_i)\\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for usual gases @xmath44 , therefore the integral over divergence will vanish for isolated solutions for which @xmath45 when @xmath46 and we the obtain the following equation : @xmath47=0.\\ ] ] apparently , this equation could be satisfied only for the case @xmath48 , i.e. there is no isolated in the above formulated sense , static solutions of the equation ( [ 18 ] ) . in order to have a static solution of (",
    "[ 18 ] ) we need to change the boundary condition @xmath45 to the condition @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is asymptotic uniform density .",
    "now we shall show that the arguments of this theorem bring no obstacles for gravitating gas .",
    "for this we again will rewrite the equations ( 16 ) for the static case , using continuity equation in the following form : @xmath51=0,\\ ] ] integrating ( [ 22 ] ) with @xmath52 over @xmath42 we obtain : @xmath53=0.\\ ] ] consider the first term of the integrand in ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "integrating by parts as above and taking into account the asymptotic conditions for @xmath39 we obtain : @xmath54 integration of the second term of the integrand in ( [ 23 ] ) is straightforward , yielding @xmath55 in such a way from equation ( [ 23 ] ) we obtain : @xmath56 this relation apparently could be satisfied for non - trivial configurations of @xmath57 .",
    "the energy functional , corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ 14 ] ) has the following form : @xmath58 the two terms of the energy functional have clear interpretation as kinetic @xmath59 and potential @xmath60 parts of energy and equation ( [ 23 ] ) expresses famous `` virial theorem '' @xcite : @xmath61 note here , that in the `` virial theorem '' equation ( [ 28 ] ) holds true for mean values of kinetic and potential energies , while in our case of static solutions there is no need to average over time .",
    "using the relation ( [ 28 ] ) we can easily find the total energy of static configuration of the gravitating gas : @xmath62",
    "so , the total energy of the static solution is negative , as for the bound state of kepler problem .",
    "the equations which define our static configurations of gravitating gas have the following form : @xmath63 taking divergence of the first equation : @xmath64 we can write the whole set of the equations for static configuration in a pure local form : @xmath65 where the last equation requires the expression @xmath66 to be a gradient .",
    "now we are going to derive an important inequality , which bounds the @xmath67 of any solution of ( [ 32 ] ) from below .",
    "for this let us introduce the notation for the potential @xmath68 : @xmath69 integrating by parts we obtain the following relation : @xmath70 using ( [ 34 ] ) we can write the expression for the energy given by ( [ 29 ] ) of any static configuration , which is the solution of ( [ 32 ] ) in the following form : @xmath71 substituting into ( [ 35 ] ) the expression for the gradient of the potential @xmath68 from the first equation ( [ 30 ] ) , we obtain the expression for the @xmath72 only through the field of velocity : @xmath73 this form is most convenient for the derivation of desired inequality .",
    "now let us consider a function @xmath74 from the hilbert space @xmath75 , which consists of all measurable functions on @xmath42 , which have at least one derivative and square integrable on @xmath42 together with its derivatives .",
    "in particular we assume that the density @xmath39 belongs to @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account the equation ( [ 31 ] ) we have @xmath76 where on the last step we have used cauchy inequality . from ( [ 37 ] ) we immediately obtain the inequality : @xmath77 which is valid for any @xmath74 from @xmath78 and is saturated for @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , let us calculate the derivative of the functional in the r.h.s of ( [ 38 ] ) with respect to @xmath74 : @xmath80.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this derivative vanishes for @xmath81 given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are inessential constants , which do not enter into the functional .",
    "it is easy to prove that the second variation of this functional is negative on the @xmath85 , so this function provides the absolute maximum for the functional and due to the equations ( [ 34]-[36 ] ) its value coincides with the l.h.s . of (",
    "however , the function @xmath85 does not belong to the hilbert space @xmath75 , because the potential @xmath68 has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath86 at infinity and therefore is not square integrable .",
    "the integral @xmath87 which enters into inequality ( [ 38 ] ) could be written in the following form @xmath88 where we denoted as @xmath89 the normalized function @xmath74 : @xmath90 in the hilbert space @xmath75 the hoelder s inequality holds true : @xmath91 as well , as the remarkable ladyjenskaya s @xcite inequality : @xmath92 here we use the standard notations : @xmath93 from these two inequalities we obtain the following bound for the integral @xmath87 : @xmath94 ) is bounded from below by appropriate norm of the density .",
    "indeed , the absolute maximum of the funcional @xmath95 should be bigger when its maximum in a restricted space like @xmath75 , given by ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "however we can not present the rigorous proof of this statement .",
    "one of the other general property of a static configurations of gas or fluid is the existence of the topological charge  `` helicity '' ( or hopf invariant ) , which explicit form is @xmath96 this object is not only the integral of motion of the equations ( 16 ) but it also is the central element of the algebra of poisson brackets of @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the existence of such an object brings additional argument for the stability of the solitons .",
    "the role of `` helicity '' in the case of the solitons in plasma was pointed out in @xcite,@xcite . moreover , in @xcite it was shown that there exists a remarkable inequality which bounds the energy of plasma solitons from below by @xmath98 .",
    "the derivation of such inequality for our case ( and in general for fluid solitons ) is highly desirable and we going to consider this question in the future publications .",
    "the equations ( [ 32 ] ) which define the static configurations of gravitating gas are 3-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations and the probability to find an analytic solution is very low .",
    "the only case where a class of solutions was found in a similar situation is the thooft - polaykov monopole , but there the requirement of the spherical symmetry simplified essentially the problem . in our case",
    "we can not expect the spherically symmetric solution because the continuity equation requires the trajectories of the particles be closed in order to provide the static configuration for @xmath99 .",
    "the simplest and most symmetric configuration we could expect for our case is the toroidal structure , where the density is concentrated in the vicinity of the axis of the toroid , while the field of velocity is tangential to the embedded one into the other toroidal surfaces .",
    "it is not the first time the toroidal - shape soliton appeared in the context of the theory of continuous media .",
    "since the pioneer works of lord kelven in xix century to the present time it was studied by many scientists both mathematician and physicists and recently the interest to the subject was again attracted by the works of faddeev and niemi @xcite,@xcite    it is clear that in the case of attractive gravitational interaction the particles , which constitute the gas move around the region with bigger density ( like planets around the sun ) so there should exists a collective motion in the approximation when the radius of torus tends to infinity and we can speak about cylindrical rather when toroidal configuration . indeed , let us consider this axially symmetric tornado - like solution of ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "for that we shall write the ansazt : @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "the second and the third equations ( [ 32 ] ) are satisfied by ( [ 47 ] ) , while the first gives @xmath102 this solution shows that the density stays an arbitrary function ( what is expected for the partial differential equations ) and the velocity grows with radius up to its asymptotic value .",
    "the later is the consequence of the approximation here we actually have 2-dimensional potential @xmath103 instead of coulomb @xmath104 .",
    "this example is to demonstrate that the particles which constitute the gravitating gas in their collective motion form the localized object .",
    "the traditional way to tackle 3-dimensional gas or fluid is to introduce for the velocity clebsh parametrization suggested in @xcite and recently discussed in@xcite . in general case this parametrization has the following form : @xmath105 where @xmath106 are scalar functions . for the toroidal solution with @xmath107  as the axis of symmetry we shall assume that the density @xmath108 does not depend upon the azimuth angle @xmath109 and clebsh parametrization takes the form : @xmath110 where @xmath111 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath112 in fluid dynamics the parametrization ( [ 50 ] ) has an interesting mechanical interpretation which we shall discuss elsewhere .",
    "the `` helicity '' functional for this case has the following form @xmath113 the function @xmath114 in ( [ 50 ] ) should has a singularity at the point @xmath115 in the semiplane @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the radius of axis line of the torus .",
    "when the point @xmath116 goes around @xmath115 , the function @xmath114 increases on @xmath118 .",
    "the gradient of such function will be the vector tangential to the toroidal surfaces .",
    "the addition of the gradient of azimuthal angle @xmath109 makes the velocity ( [ 50 ] ) winding also in the azimuth direction .",
    "such a behaviour of the field of velocity leads to the nontrivial hopf invariant , which characterizes the homotopy classes @xmath119 .",
    "described this way the clebsh parameters , together with the density @xmath39 could be found by numerical integration of the equations ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "the construction we presented and discussed above would be incomplete and too academic without an example of the galaxy which indeed may demonstrate the toroidal structure .",
    "fortunately such galaxy does exists .",
    "it was discovered back in 1950 by art hoag and recently a very good picture was obtained by hubble telescope ( see figure 1 ) . on this picture",
    "it is clearly seen the toroidal structure and moreover the motion of the stars seem to be very close to what we should expect for the configuration with nontrivial `` helicity '' functional . in the gallery of the galaxies which is available on the sites http://www.astronomy.com or http://hubblesite.ogr we can find some other examples with the form more or less close to the torus , but the hoag s object is the best of all .",
    "these examples show that the model we considered might be not so trivial and could explain more sophisticated structures like spiral galaxy .",
    "i would like to thank professors a.k.likhoded and a.v .",
    "rasumov for valuable discussions .",
    "the picture of hoag s object is available due to the courtesy of space telescope science institute .",
