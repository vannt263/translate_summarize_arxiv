    "the connection between the mass of a central supermassive black hole ( hereafter mbh ) and the properties of the host galaxy ( see , e.g. , the @xmath5 relation ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , together with the recognition that a mbh resides at the center of every massive spheroid in the local universe ( e.g. , ferrarese & ford 2005 ) , has led to the idea that the formation and evolution of the mbh and the host galaxy are intimately related ( e.g. , springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 , sazonov et al . 2005 , hopkins et al .",
    "2006a ) . in this picture , feedback from the mbh has been advocated to regulate starformation at early epochs , producing the observed galaxy mass function and colors ( e.g. , croton et al .",
    "2006 ) ; in later epochs , feedback is required to heat the galactic flows solving the `` cooling flow '' problem ( e.g. , omma et al .",
    "2004 ; ostriker & ciotti 2005 , 2007 ; churazov et al .",
    "2005 , mcnamara et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although feedback is a promising mechanism for solving many observational puzzles , our understanding of how accretion and feedback work , and of their evolution over cosmic time , is still uncomplete .",
    "it has been suggested that after the bright agn phase accretion switches to a more radiatively quiet or inefficient mode ( e.g. , churazov et al . 2005 , hopkins et al .",
    "2006b ) possibly associated with radio jets or outflows that may carry out most of the accretion power ( di matteo et al .",
    "2003 , pellegrini et al .",
    "2003 , falcke et al .",
    "2004 , allen et al .",
    "indeed , the nuclei of most of the nearby spheroids are either radiatively quiescent or exhibit low levels of activity ( e.g. , ho 2005 , pellegrini 2005a ) .",
    "typically , these nuclei are not associated with detectable radio sources , but the absence of radio emission in itself does not exclude nuclear activity , since frustrated or not collimated nuclear outflows would be hard to detect ( nagar et al .",
    "also , intermittent agn activity is suggested by the x - ray and radio morphology of nearby clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "2006 ) and galaxies ( e.g. , machacek et al .",
    "2006 ) , and may originate in an accretion flow that switches between different accretion modes ( janiuk et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in nearby spheroids we can attempt to constrain observationally the modalities of accretion ( and feedback ) through detailed studies of the stellar population , the ism and the current star formation rate for the central @xmath6one hundred parsec region , especially if the agn emission does not dominate over the other nuclear components .",
    "ngc  821 , an isolated elliptical galaxy at a distance of 24.1  mpc ( table  [ mainlog ] ) , is an ideal target for studying how these phenomena have evolved in the local universe .",
    "there is compelling evidence of the presence of a central mbh in this galaxy , from resolved dynamical studies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "ngc821 has a very regular and smooth optical appearance ( lauer et al .",
    "2005 ) and the old and metal rich stellar population typical of elliptical galaxies ( proctor et al .",
    "2005 ) ; no cold ( hi ) or dusty ism ( sarzi et al . 2006 , ravindranath et al .",
    "2001 ) have been observed in it , restricting the potential reservoir for accretion .",
    "the mbh of ngc821 has a mass of @xmath7 ( table  [ mainlog ] ) and an eddington luminosity of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , if radiatively efficient accretion were taking place , this galaxy should be a luminous agn . instead , this mbh is extremely quiescent",
    ". very low limits on optical emission lines ( h@xmath9 , h@xmath10 , or [ oiii ] ) are reported for the nucleus of ngc821 ( ho 2002 ; ho et al .",
    "2003 ; sarzi et al .",
    "2006 ) and the limits on nuclear radio emission are also stringent : @xmath111.5 mjy at 15 ghz ( with 150 mas resolution ; nagar et al .",
    "2005 ) and @xmath110.5 mjy at 5 ghz ( with 5@xmath12 resolution ; wrobel & heeschen 1991 ) .    thanks to a deep @xmath0 pointing for a total exposure of 230 ksec ( discussed in pellegrini et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter p07 ) , a source was detected for the first time at the nucleus of ngc821 ( called s2 ) .",
    "s2 is extended ( tab .",
    "[ tabspec ] ) , but it has a flat ( @xmath13 ) unabsorbed x - ray spectrum , excluding a central concentration of hot , optically thin ism .",
    "its 210 kev luminosity is @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 .",
    "an upper limit of 2.8@xmath16 erg s@xmath15 was placed on a possible pointlike 0.38 kev emission associated with the mbh ; this is one of the smallest values obtained with @xmath0 for galactic nuclei ( pellegrini 2005b ) .",
    "in addition to the nucleus , also the hot ism that could provide a source of fuel for the mbh can be measured in the x - rays ( e.g. , loewenstein et al .",
    "2001 ; soria et al .",
    "our deep , sub - arcsecond @xmath0 pointing revealed diffuse emission in the central part of ngc  821 , but also led to the detection of a population of x - ray binaries which can account for most  if not all  of the diffuse emission , so that we could place a very stringent upper limit on the contribution of a hot gaseous component ( p07 ) .",
    "this deep pointing highlighted the presence of three other sources around s2 , of luminosity and spectral shape consistent with those of low mass x - ray binaries ; only one is consistent with being pointlike , though , the other two ( s1 and s4 ) are extended ( tab .",
    "[ s1-s4 ] ) , and could be due to the superposition of few point sources and/or truly diffuse emission .",
    "in particular , the morphology of s1 resembles a jet - like feature ( see also fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we report the results of an observational campaign aimed at complementing the @xmath0 results , to better constrain the nature of the processes taking place in the vicinity of the mbh in ngc821 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ endistr ] we summarize the main @xmath0 results concerning the nuclear sources , we present the results of the new vla and @xmath3 observations , of the archival @xmath4 optical data , and previous nicmos results ; in section  [ quie ] we discuss possible scenarios for accretion around this mbh ; in section  [ concl ] we summarize our conclusions .",

    "emission was marginally detected at 8.4 ghz ( 71 @xmath2jy ; 4.2@xmath27 ) , peaking at the same position to within the measurement uncertainty .",
    "the noise level at 8.4 ghz was about one and a half order of magnitude lower than the earlier upper limit obtained at 15 ghz by nagar et al .",
    "a marginal detection at 4.8 ghz was also possible ( 80@xmath2jy ; 4.0@xmath27 ) ; in this case the prospective peak lies @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 beamwidth ) to the south .",
    "the three flux densities correspond to a power law with spectral index @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the estimated spectral index may be viewed with some caution because it depends on measurements made with very different beamwidths .",
    "however , we have studied images at 1.4 ghz made with different weighting schemes ( i.e. , natural and uniform ) and we did not find a significant change in peak signal to noise ratio at the location of s2 , for beam sizes of @xmath32 to @xmath33 . at this and other frequencies ,",
    "there is no indication that we might be partially resolving the emission for s2 ; however , multi - configuration data would be needed to properly address this question .",
    "no sources were detected at the location of the other @xmath0 sources s1 , s3 and s4 in the central galactic region ( sect .  4 in p07 ; fig .  [ radioim ] ) .",

    "2001 ) , are bluer than the background starlight and could be nuclear star clusters or low luminosity agns .",

    "[ intro ] ) , therefore our deep look at the nucleus of ngc821 has a bearing on a very common state of mbhs . in the following we use our observational results to constrain the process of accretion in this nucleus",
    ".      given the general lack of fuel available for accretion observed at all wavelengths , including the x - rays ( sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) , is a truly dead mbh what we should expect at the center of ngc821 ?",
    "in fact , an aging stellar population continuously returns gas to the ism , via its stellar mass losses ( ciotti et al .",
    "1991 , david et al .",
    "1991 ) , and the circumnuclear region should be replenished with this fuel . indeed ,",
    "hydrodynamical simulations specific for ngc821 ( p07 ) demonstrate that this fuel should be present .",
    "while the bulk of the hot gas is expelled out in a wind ( consistent with the lack of detection of hot gas ) , the stellar mass losses are accreting within a very small region of @xmath58 pc from the nucleus ; at the innermost radius resolved by the simulations ( 10 pc ) , the mass accretion rate is @xmath59few@xmath60 yr@xmath15 . notwithstanding the limitations of the simulations , and the uncertainties associated with the observables used as input parameters ,",
    "the presence of this small inflowing region was considered a robust result ( see p07 ) ; similarly , a range of values for @xmath61 yr@xmath15 was considered reliable ( with the caveat that the true , final accretion rate on the mbh could be somewhat higher ; p07 ) .",
    "@xmath62 should produce a luminosity @xmath63(14)@xmath64 erg s@xmath15 if , closer in to the mbh , it ends up in a standard accretion disc with a radiative efficiency @xmath65 as assumed for classical agns ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this would be a highly sub - eddington agn , though , since @xmath66few@xmath67 . for a standard spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agns ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , the upper limit on a pointlike nuclear x - ray emission ( tab .",
    "[ tabspec ] ) corresponds to a bolometric upper limit of @xmath68 erg s@xmath15 , that is already 30 to 100 times less than @xmath69 .    below we explore scenarios for the evolution of the accreting material",
    ", that would explain why the nucleus is not observed at a luminosity as high as @xmath69 .",
    "we consider , in turn , the presence of angular momentum in the accreting material ( sect .",
    "[ ang ] ) , a reduction of the accretion rate due to starformation in a circumnuclear disc ( sect .",
    "[ bc03 ] ) , accretion at low radiative efficiency ( sect .  [ effic ] ) , the presence of a jet / outflow , whose kinetic power possibly accounts for a fraction of @xmath70 ( sect .  [ aneta ] ) , a transition in the accretion mode due to disk instabilities ( sect .",
    "[ instab ] ) and finally obscuration of the nuclear radiation produced by a scaled - down agn ( sect .",
    "[ osc ] ) .",
    "note that the mass accretion rate of galactic nuclei has been often estimated ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) assuming spherically symmetric accretion from a nonrotating polytropic gas with given density and temperature at infinity ( bondi 1952 ) .",
    "moscibrodzka ( 2006 ) calculated model spectra emitted by such a bondi flow for a sample of low luminosity agns , including ngc821 . the adopted value of gas density was larger than constrained now thanks to the deep @xmath0 pointing ( p07 ) ; even so , the predicted x - ray emission was @xmath71  ergs  s@xmath15 , that is @xmath72 orders of magnitude below the limit on pointlike nuclear emission ( tab .",
    "[ tabspec ] ) .",
    "however , the bondi accretion is a severe mathematical approximation of the accretion process ( see also p07 ) ; for example , some initial angular momentum of the flow captured by the mbh , and the inclusion of viscosity , may result in a higher x - ray luminosity .",
    "radiation models applied to global mhd simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows are being developed and will be applied to this nucleus ( moscibrodzka et al . , in preparation ; see also balbus & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "the inclusion of even slow rotational motion of the gas at large radii can significantly reduce the rate at which mass is captured into the accretion flow , compared to the non - rotating case ( proga & begelman 2003 ) .",
    "the motivation for the proga & begelman s study was to make less severe the problem that mbhs in the local universe are much dimmer than expected for a mass accretion rate estimated at large radii via the bondi ( 1952 ) formula ( sect .  [ dead ] ) and ending up in a standard disc ( e.g. , fabian & canizares 1988 , pellegrini 2005a ) .",
    "while the bondi formula assumes spherically symmetric accretion from a nonrotating gas under the sole influence of the central gravity , proga & begelman ( 2003 ) studied the evolution of the flow with a small angular momentum , including regions beyond the domination of the mbh gravity .",
    "they found that the mass supply rate to the mbh can be smaller by up to @xmath73 orders of magnitude with respect to the nonrotating case . in ngc821",
    "the stellar kinematics becomes disc - like within the central @xmath74 ( scorza & bender 1995 , emsellem et al .",
    "2004 ) , therefore the stellar mass losses close to the galactic center are likely to have angular momentum , which would lead to a reduction of @xmath62 .",
    "whether the expected luminosity could become consistent with the observed upper limits is however more questionable , since it is not known what is the final , net effect of the inclusion of angular momentum at large radii on the resulting luminosity of the flow closer to the mbh .",
    "it is probably not plausible that gas inflowing at the rate shown by the simulations ( that is equal to @xmath62 of sect .",
    "[ dead ] at present and was larger in the past , for a total integrated mass of few@xmath75 over the past @xmath76 gyrs ; p07 ) continues to accumulate for many gyrs in the nuclear region without accreting and without becoming observable .",
    "however , in order for the gas to be able to accrete , angular momentum must be transferred outward through viscosity , and this may actually increase the luminosity of the flow .",
    "mhd simulations with rotation and cooling by radiation included are needed to really state what happens to the luminosity of the flow ( see also sect .  [ dead ] ) .",
    "condensation into stars in a gravitationally unstable disc can prevent a significant fraction of the accreting gas from reaching the mbh ( tan & blackman 2005 ) , resulting into a much lower true accretion rate ; this starformation should produce h@xmath9 and ir emission . as reported in sect .",

    "[ tablesed ] ) and compared it with sed templates for stellar populations of different ages and metallicities , for the kroupa ( 2001 ) imf ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) ; we also allowed for an exponentially declining starformation rate with time scale @xmath80 .",

    "these properties match closely those obtained from spatially resolved optical spectroscopy for the bulk of the stellar population ( proctor et al .",

    "therefore we fitted the observed data points also with a metallicity of 2.5 solar ( the largest value available for the templates ) ; this resulted in an age of @xmath85 gyr , but the fit was not as good as the previous one ( dotted line in fig .",

    "it has been suggested that high - luminosity and low - luminosity agns host two different accretion modes : a radiatively efficient disk - dominated one and a radiatively inefficient one , which is expected to be coupled to strong outflows ( see narayan 2005 for a recent review ) .",
    "the sed of a few low - luminosity agns indeed has been modelled with truncated optically thick disks with inner radiatively inefficient flows ( e.g. , m81 and ngc4579 , quataert et al .",

    ", the flow produces the x - ray emission , while the radio emission comes from the base of a nuclear jet , if present ( e.g. , falcke et al .",
    "2004 , krding et al .",
    "in fact , observations seem to suggest that low - luminosity agns are `` radio - loud '' ( ho 2002 , terashima & wilson 2003 , wu & cao 2005 ) ; moreover , often their radio power and sometimes also their radio spectrum require a separate , compact jet component ( anderson et al . 2004 ; nagar et al . 2005 ) . on the theoretical side ,",
