    "there has been recently a renewed interest@xmath7 on two basic quantities , both related to the photon vacuum polarization : the hadronic contribution to the anomalous moment of the muon , @xmath8 , and the running qed charge @xmath9 defined at the @xmath3 particle pole . in what respects the first",
    ", the reason is the advanced status of the experiment planned at brookhaven which should improve the present accuracy by more than one order of magnitude ; in what respects the second , because the quantity @xmath10 plays a leading role in precision determination of electroweak parameters .    in this paper",
    "we consider the contributions of the hadronic part of the photon vacuum polarization tensor to @xmath8 and @xmath11 , that we write respectively as @xmath12 these quantities may be expressed in terms of the photon hadron vacuum polarization function @xmath13 .",
    "one can then write a dispersion relation for this function in such a way that the experimentally accessible quantity @xmath14 appears instead of @xmath15 : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 the reason why we think we can improve on existing estimates of @xmath18 is that we may use the very reliable _ theoretical _ qcd calculations that have been extended with great precision to regions previously unaccessible ; in particular@xmath19 to the regions right above threshold for heavy quark production ( @xmath20 ) as well as the very low ( @xmath21 ) energies .",
    "the extensions have been possible because of the high orders attained by the qcd calculations@xmath22 and the use of the precisely known value of @xmath23 on the @xmath24 mass@xmath25 , @xmath26 likewise , the use of the value@xmath27 of @xmath23 at the @xmath3 , @xmath28 allows us to reduce still further the uncertainties in the high energy regions .",
    "in the region @xmath30 , perturbative qcd is clearly invalid .",
    "one thus has to rely on experiment , supplemented by old - fashioned hadron theory .",
    "the region may be further split into the @xmath31 resonance region ( say , @xmath32 ) and the rest . for @xmath33",
    "we have , @xmath34 here the second term in the r.h.s . is the @xmath35 interference contribution .",

    "the quasi - two - body channels contribution to @xmath44 is estimated in the vector - meson dominance approximation : @xmath73 using the phenomenological interactions @xmath74 one can relate this to the radiative decay widths , @xmath75^{3/2 } \\left [ t - ( m_v - m_p)^2 \\right]^{3/2 }   \\over t^{1/2 } \\ , ( t-4\\,m_{\\mu}^2)^{3/2 } } \\ . \\eqnum{3.10}\\ ] ] the decay widths are taken from experiment .",

    "these curves are drawn in fig .",

    "the numerical results obtained with these interpolation functions are : @xmath79 the central values have been obtained using @xmath80 , and the systematic errors have been estimated from the difference @xmath81 .",

    "( 3.1 , 3.2 ) we see they agree , within errors .",
    "we however believe our evaluation to be more reliable than those estimates which were obtained using experimental data only , because of the known existence of large systematic errors of the last .",

    "( 4.6 ) includes also nonperturbative corrections with @xmath95 , and the evaluation is valid until these are of order unity , @xmath96 , down to a critical velocity @xmath97 for the heavy quarks , we find it more convenient to reexpress the @xmath98 in terms of the _ pole _ masses @xmath99 : one has@xmath100 @xmath101^{-\\gamma_0/\\beta_{\\!_0}}\\ ; \\left\\ {    1 + { a\\,\\alpha_{\\hskip-1.pt s}(t ) - ( { c_{\\!_f}}-a)\\alpha_{\\hskip-1.pt s}(m^2 ) \\over \\pi } \\right\\ } \\ \\ , \\\\",

    "a crude estimate can now be obtained if one uses for @xmath106 the following approximation : @xmath107 the expression is however discontinuous at @xmath108 . to obtain a smooth joining of the low and high energy regions",
    ", we can use the following two interpolation curves for @xmath46 : @xmath109 we consider @xmath110 to be a very reasonable approximation , and take the difference between @xmath111 as an estimate of the systematic error due interpolations .",
    "we also take into account the error due to the input parameters @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , as well as the error due to the non - perturbative contribution .",
    "the last is obtained by setting @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( 4.6 ) and allowing the velocity @xmath116 of the heavy quarks to go to zero .",
    "our best estimate for the contribution of the regions in the continuum is : @xmath117 the first systematic error is due to interpolations , the second is due to the error in the input parameters , and the last is the non - perturbative one .",
    "besides using our theoretical estimates for the high energy regions @xmath118 for @xmath119 an extra ( slight ) improvement may be incorporated if we repeat the dispersive analysis of ref.@xcite in the @xmath31 region using recent data .",
    "the reason for this improvement is the following : in that paper the @xmath31 contribution to ( say ) @xmath120 , had been estimated from fits to the pion form factor @xmath121 alone ( but both in the spacelike and timelike regions ) or imposing also the values of the @xmath122 phase shifts .",
    "the first method gave @xmath123 , the second @xmath124 , both compatible ( at the @xmath125 level ) with the then preferred experimental value @xmath126 .",
    "although , as explained in ref.@xcite , the first method was considered more reliable , both were combined taking the difference between the two determinations as a measure of the _ systematic _ error of the calculation . since the presently accepted experimental figure",
    ", @xmath127 clearly discriminates in favor of the method based on @xmath121 only , we can dispense with the ( poorly known ) @xmath122 phase shifts and avoid the systematic error .",
    "we need only alter the evaluation by taking into account the change in the accepted value for the @xmath31 width , @xmath128 from that used in ref.@xcite , @xmath129 ( compatible with the 1985 experimental value , @xmath130 but not with the presently preferred one ) . to first order this is easily taken into account as a variation @xmath131 .",
    "the results are summarized in the following tables where we also report , for purposes of comparison , the evaluations of the first ( ej ) and third ( mz ) papers of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have composed quadratically statistical and systematic errors : there are so many of the last , and of such varied origins , that they may be taken to behave statistically on the average . for the muon anomaly we have , @xmath132 and @xmath133 with the overall results @xmath134 which agree within the quoted errors .    for the running qed coupling , one has @xmath135 and @xmath136 and now the full results are @xmath137 our central value for @xmath40 is slightly higher than that of ref.@xcite ( ej ) , but deviates at the 3 - 4 @xmath138level from that given by the third article of ref.@xcite : @xmath139    we conclude this paper with a few comments on possible ways to improve the results . certainly , better knowledge of @xmath23 both on the @xmath24 and @xmath3 masses would increase the precision of the high energy evaluations ; but most of the error comes from the region @xmath140 gev .",
    "even a modest improvement of a factor two in the error in the region between 0.8 and 1.1 gev would result in a substantial decrease , roughly by the same amount , of the overall error for @xmath33 , and about 20% for @xmath141 .",
    "this emphasizes the interest of some of the accelerators , projected or in construction , with the capability to explore these energy ranges .",
