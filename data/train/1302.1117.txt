    "despite almost seventy years of investigations on nuclear fission , this process still continues to be of great interest .",
    "the disintegration of the nucleus into two fragments of similar masses is accompanied by a complete rearrangement of the nuclear structure , and the dynamical process leading to fission determines the characteristics of the fragments in the final states .",
    "investigation of the photo - fission process in heavy nuclei is very interesting not only for the study of the fission mechanism itself , but also to obtain information about total photo - absorption @xcite .",
    "photons provide a convenient tool to study nuclear properties of a fissile system and to explore nuclear transformations at large deformations . in the case of photo - nuclear reactions ,",
    "volume absorption dominates and , as a result , the photon effectively `` heats '' the nucleus . for this reason ,",
    "the excitation of the nucleus in different energy ranges reflects the nature of the interaction with incident photons . in the analysis of experiments with bremsstrahlung photons ,",
    "the calculations of the total photo - fission yield takes into account the contributions of the different interaction modes by summing over the entire spectrum of photons .",
    "the calculation of fission cross section within different models and their comparison with data provides an opportunity to estimate the validity of the various photo - absorption mechanisms as well as to investigate characteristics of the processes taking place in reactions induced by different probes . among the properties that can be used to compare calculations with data are charge and mass distributions of the fragments , energy dependence of the fission cross section , and the ratio of symmetric and asymmetric components of fission products . in the present work ,",
    "calculations for fragments produced in photo - fission of heavy nuclei , @xmath0th and @xmath1u , induced by bremsstrahlung photons with endpoint energies of 50 and 3500 mev are presented .",
    "the most important quantities calculated are mass- and charge - distributions for each of the target nuclei at the two energies , 50 and 3500 mev .",
    "comparison with data is performed and the analysis allows the extraction of information about the fission process following the absorption of the photon .",
    "the data considered here were obtained from experiments described in detail elsewhere @xcite and the calculations were performed with the crisp code @xcite .",
    "crisp is a monte carlo code which simulates , in a two step process , nuclear reactions induced by photons or protons @xcite .",
    "first , an intranuclear cascade is simulated following a time - ordered sequence of collisions in a many - body system @xcite , and when the intranuclear cascade finishes , the evaporation of nucleons and alpha - particles begins , in competition with the fission process @xcite . in the simulation ,",
    "reactions can be initiated by intermediate and high energy protons @xcite or photons @xcite .",
    "the crisp code has been shown to be reliable in reproducing photon induced reactions and gave good results for total photo - nuclear absorption cross sections for energies from approximately 50 mev , where the quasi - deuteron absorption mechanism is dominant , up to 3.5 gev , where the so - called photon - hadronization mechanism leads to a shadowing effect in the cross section @xcite .",
    "one important feature of the code , in simulating the intranuclear cascade , is the pauli blocking mechanism , which avoids violation of the pauli principle . in the crisp code",
    "a strict verification of this principle is performed at each step of the cascade , resulting in a more realistic simulation of the process .",
    "the advantages of such an approach have been discussed elsewhere ( see for instance ref . @xcite and references therein ) . in the evaporation / fission competition that follows the intranuclear cascade ,",
    "weisskopf s model is adopted to calculate the branching ratios of the evaporating channels , which includes evaporation of neutrons , protons and alpha - particles @xcite and the bohr - wheeler - model is adopted for fission .",
    "when one particle is emitted during the evaporation process , the excitation energy of the final state nucleus is calculated by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the excitation energy of the final and initial nucleus , respectively , @xmath5 is the evaporated particle separation energy , @xmath6 is its coulomb potential , and @xmath7 is the mean kinetic energy of the emitted particle , which is fixed at 2 mev . the code has provided good agreement of photo - fission cross section data @xcite .",
    "the crisp code has also already been used to evaluate mass distributions of fragments for fission induced by photons at intermediate energies @xcite , and to calculate spallation yields and neutron multiplicities for reactions induced by high energy protons @xcite , giving results in good agreement with data . moreover ,",
    "the code has already been used in studies of the ads ( accelerator driving system ) nuclear - reactors @xcite .",
    "the fission process has been successfully described by the multimodal - random neck rupture model ( mm - rnrm ) @xcite , which takes into account the collective effects of nuclear deformation during fission through a liquid - drop model , and includes single - particle effects through microscopic shell - model corrections .",
    "the microscopic corrections create valleys in the space of elongation and mass number , each valley corresponding to a different fission mode @xcite . in the mm - rnrm ,",
    "the yield of fragments is described for each mode by a gaussian distribution which is characterized by the fragment s mass and atomic number , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . according to this model",
    ", the mass - yield curve can be decomposed into three distinct fission components : one symmetric superlong and two asymmetric , standard i and standard ii .",
    "superlong mode fragments are strongly elongated with masses around @xmath10/2 .",
    "the standard i mode is characterized by the influence of the spherical neutron shell @xmath1182 and proton shell @xmath1250 in the heavy fragments with masses @xmath13132 - 134 .",
    "the standard ii mode is characterized by the influence of the deformed neutron shell closure @xmath14=86 - 88 and proton shell @xmath1252 in the heavy fragments with masses @xmath13138 - 140 .",
    "there is a new investigation of the influence of shell closures by schmidt and jurado @xcite indicating that the fission of a large number of isotopes is governed not by the neutron closed or deformed shells at n=82 or n=88 but by the proton number @xmath15 .",
    "here we consider that fission can take place through one of these three different modes , and that the total mass - yield is obtained by the sum of the three gaussian functions @xcite :    @xmath16 ,   \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the fragment mass number ; @xmath17 is the mean mass number which determines the center of the gaussian functions ; and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and d@xmath20 are the contribution , dispersion and position parameters of the @xmath21 gaussian functions . the indexes @xmath22 and @xmath23 designate the asymmetric and symmetric components .",
    "note that , when using the crisp code , it is possible to work on event - by - event basis , and therefore the parameter @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is completely determined by the mass of the fissioning nucleus , that is , @xmath24 . during the calculation ,",
    "we have defined two types of fissioning nuclei , before ( @xmath25 ) and after ( @xmath26 ) post - fission neutron evaporation , where a@xmath27+a@xmath28=@xmath26 , and the indexes @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for heavy and light mass fragments .",
    "the quantities @xmath17 + d@xmath31 = a@xmath27 and @xmath17 - d@xmath31 = a@xmath28 determine the positions of the heavy and light peaks of the asymmetric components on the mass scale .",
    "the values of a@xmath27 + a@xmath28 and 2@xmath17 were treated as the masses of nuclei that undergo fission in the respective channel .",
    "typical values for these parameters obtained in a fitting process can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fragment charge distribution can be estimated by considering the gaussian functions in the form @xcite :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the independent yield of the nuclide ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 is the total yield for a given mass number @xmath8 , @xmath36 is the most probable charge for isobars with mass number @xmath8 and @xmath37 is the width parameter .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be represented as slowly varying linear functions of the mass numbers of fission fragments :    @xmath38    and @xmath39    the multimodal model has been used previously to describe spontaneous fission @xcite , low - energy induced fission @xcite , fission induced by thermal - neutrons @xcite and 12 mev protons @xcite , and even fission induced by intermediate energy probes such as 190 mev protons @xcite , neutrons at energies up to 200 mev @xcite , and also by heavy - ions @xcite .",
    "the crisp code was then adapted to consider the multimodal model by the use of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . to determine the fission fragment masses by the crisp code it is necessary to attribute values for the parameters used in the multimode approach , which is not a trivial problem .",
    "since the crisp code simulates the entire process up to the point of fission , the fissioning nucleus of all events is known , which leads to the fact that @xmath17 can not be taken as a free parameter but as a distribution instead .",
    "therefore , at every point of decision on the fission channel , the appropriate value for @xmath17 is used considering the nucleus which is undergoing fission .",
    "whenever the fission channel is chosen , the masses and atomic numbers of the heavy fragments produced , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , are sorted according to eq .",
    "the light fragments are obtained according to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath25 and @xmath44 are the mass and atomic number of the fissioning nucleus , respectively . as mentioned , @xmath17 is the average mass number of the fragments for the symmetric component , which determines the center of the gaussian function .",
    "it is related to the mass of fissioning nucleus by 2@xmath17=@xmath25 , where @xmath25=@xmath40+@xmath45 .    as a final step ,",
    "all fragments , obtained in the above fashion , evaporate according to the model of evaporation / fission competition already mentioned .",
    "the energy of each fragment is determined using :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the excitation energy and the mass number of the fragment @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is the total excitation energy of the fragments which is assumed , as an approximation , to be equal to the excitation energy of the fissioning system .",
    "the crisp code is used here to analyse data on fission fragment distributions produced by photo - fission of @xmath0th and @xmath1u .",
    "the data were obtained from radiation of bremsstrahlung photons on @xmath0th and @xmath1u targets . the bremsstrahlung photons with endpoint energies of 3500 and",
    "50 mev were obtained with the yerevan electron synchrotron and a linear accelerator of injector type , respectively . in these measurements ,",
    "the electrons were converted into a bremsstrahlung photon beam by means of a tungsten converter of about 300@xmath51 m .",
    "the photon - beam intensity was determined with a wilson type quantameter , and the obtained average values were @xmath52 and @xmath53 equivalent photons per second at the maximum energy of 3500 mev and 50 mev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0th and @xmath1u targets had 20@xmath51 m and 70@xmath51 m of thickness , respectively .",
    "the yields of radioactive fission fragments were measured in off - line mode with a hpge semiconductor detector .",
    "the energies of the gamma transitions and the relations between their intensities , as well as half - lives , were used to select reaction products and to determine their yields .",
    "measurements of the gamma spectra started about 120 minutes after the irradiation was finished and lasted for a year .",
    "more details on these experiments can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "usually , in such off - line analysis , the detected fragments represent the final products of the fission process after neutrons and gamma - rays are emitted from both the fissioning nucleus and the primary fragments .",
    "thus , comparison between calculation and experiment allows the unfolding of the contributions of pre- and post - scission neutron emissions .",
    "here we are considering the charge and mass characteristics of the fission products to obtain information about the hot nuclear system and its decay channels .",
    "as discussed above , according to eq .",
    "( [ frag_yield ] ) , the charge distribution for an isobar chain with mass number @xmath8 , from a fissioning heavy nuclei , is characterized by a gaussian shape with parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the most - probable charge and the corresponding width of the distribution .",
    "the best representation regarding the most probable charge @xmath36 is a linear function of the mass of the fission fragment , as given by the empirical eq .",
    "( 3 ) @xcite .",
    "although these parameters have a linear dependence on a , through eqs .",
    "( [ zp ] ) and  ( [ gp ] ) , respectively , experimentally , the @xmath37 are practically independent of a @xcite .    in table",
    "i , we summarized the experimental and calculated relevant parameters , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath56 used in the present work to determine @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "as one can see , the calculated parameter @xmath57 is very small for all four cases , indicating that @xmath37 is almost constant .",
    "experimentally , instead of considering the @xmath37 , we averaged the @xmath58 ( full width at half maximum ) of all charge distributions . the small deviation around the average values is another indication that this parameter is practically independent of a. although it has been experimentally observed that the width of charge distribution @xmath37 is independent of a , there is a small mass dependence in the calculated values given by the parameter @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and shown in table 1 . from the value of fwhm and @xmath57 in table 1 , it is clear , that as the excitation energy increases , the charge distribution becomes slightly wider .",
    "in general , a similar dependence was observed in fission induced by particles of different types at excitation energies up to 100 mev @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the difference between the calculated and experimental values for @xmath59 of the charge distributions for the @xmath1u and @xmath0th targets at the two endpoint energies .",
    "it is possible to observe that the overall difference is around @xmath600.3 units , corresponding to approximately 25% of the total width @xmath37 , and that the difference is in the same range for both endpoint energies .",
    "the deviation between calculation and experiment presents an approximately linear increase with mass number @xmath8 for all four cases studied , going from -0.3 for @xmath61 85 to + 0.3 for @xmath62 150 .",
    "the fluctuation observed in this deviation seems to be a manifestation of fragment shell effect ( @xmath6350 ) , which might not have been completely taken into account by the linear parametrization of eqs .",
    "( [ zp ] ) and  ( [ gp ] ) .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in the direct comparison of calculated and experimental most - probable charge , @xmath36 shown in figs . 2 and 3 for the @xmath1u and @xmath0th targets , respectively .",
    "2 and 3 show both the experimental values of the most probable charge @xmath36 and the values calculated by the crisp model for @xmath1u and @xmath0th , respectively , at the two incident energies . in general , the experimental values of @xmath64 cogently fit to those obtained by model calculations . to be more quantitative , the reduced @xmath65 was used to evaluate the comparison between data and crisp calculations .",
    "the results obtained are , for @xmath1u , @xmath66 at @xmath67 mev and @xmath68 for @xmath69 mev ; and for @xmath0th : @xmath70 for @xmath67 mev ; @xmath71 at @xmath69 mev )",
    ". it can be noticed that both calculated values and data present an overall linear trend with the mass number @xmath8 , as given by the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "as one can see in table 1 , the value of the calculated parameters @xmath55 for the uranium isotope , at both energies , are slightly higher than the experimental ones . as a result ,",
    "the values obtained for the most probable charge @xmath36 , for a given mass number , are shifted to a larger value ( more neutron deficient ) . in figs . 2 and 3",
    "one can see that the calculated values for @xmath36 are mostly on the left side , proton - rich side , of the experimental values , especially for low energy fission for both isotopes .",
    "this is a reflection of the dependence of the parameter @xmath55 on charge and mass of the fissioning nucleus , and thus , on the average number of emitted neutrons from the fission fragments @xcite .",
    "the calculated values for the parameter @xmath54 are about one unit below the experimental values for the uranium target at both energies and one unit above for the thorium target .",
    "the higher measured values for @xmath54 , in comparison with the calculated ones , indicate that the calculation favors a most probable charge for the fission products of uranium target closer to the stable nucleus . with the increase of excitation energy and the atomic number of the fissioning nucleus",
    ", one would expect that @xmath36 of an isobaric chain would become closer to the z values of a more stable nucleus .",
    "therefore , the model is considering greater evaporation of neutrons from the fission fragments . in the case of thorium",
    "the situation is the opposite , but the agreement with calculated values is better .",
    "we can assert that the model considers more correctly the evaporation of neutrons for the th target .",
    "also , as one can see in both figs . 2 and 3 , for @xmath8 around 125 ,",
    "the data show a slight deviation between calculated and experimental @xmath36 values in the region of @xmath72130 .",
    "this deviation is more prominent in the case of the @xmath1u target .",
    "these results suggest that the crisp calculation can be improved by including shell effects in the parametrization of @xmath36 .",
    "however , aside from the slight deviation discussed above , the calculation seems to present a general small shift to neutron deficient fragments , which also can be corrected in the next upgraded version of the code .",
    "this analysis of parameter values shows that , in general , the crisp model describes fairly well the most probable charge of the charge distribution for the fission fragments for @xmath0th and for @xmath1u , with some fluctuations in @xmath37 .",
    "it can , however , be assumed that the model takes into account the main properties of fissile systems and provide a way to predict some characteristics of the fragment charge distribution .    as can be observed in the data ,",
    "as we increase the endpoint energy the composite system has a higher excitation energy producing , on average , fissioning nuclei with less neutrons due to the higher number of evaporated neutrons ( proton evaporation is suppressed due to the coulomb barrier ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the following produced heavier fragments will also evaporate more neutrons and as a result , the fragments with same a will have larger @xmath9 shifting , on average , the @xmath36 parameter to higher values .",
    "similar behavior is observed for fission induced by different probes such protons and neutrons on @xmath1u and @xmath0th @xcite , indicating that the charge distributions are determined more by the excitation energy and nuclear properties of the reaction products than by the choice of projectile .",
    "the origin of asymmetric fission is associated with the shell structure of the fissioning nucleus and nuclear fragments @xcite , whereas symmetric fission is consistent with a classical liquid - drop model of the fissioning nucleus @xcite , and it is the most relevant mechanism for fission of highly excited ( @xmath73 50 mev ) nuclei . therefore , mass distributions of fragments depend on the mass of the fissioning nuclei and on its excitation energy .",
    "the calculations with the crisp code consider the three - mode hypothesis discussed previouly , corresponding to one symmetric ( superlong ) and two asymmetric dynamics ( standard i and standard ii ) .",
    "the results obtained allow a complete analysis of the fragment - mass distributions for @xmath1u and @xmath0th .",
    "the total fission mass - yield distribution as a function of the product mass number ( @xmath8 ) for @xmath1u and @xmath0th targets at @xmath67 , 3500 mev are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( a , b ) and fig . 5",
    "( a , b ) , respectively .",
    "qualitatively , the agreement between the calculation and the experimental data is fairly good at both endpoint energies , particularly for low energies , where the calculations reproduce the experimental data quite well .",
    "this fact shows that the model correctly takes into account the influence of shell effects for low energy fission , associated with asymmetric fission modes : the strong spherical neutron shell at @xmath74 and the deformed neutron shell at @xmath75 become dominant and lead to asymmetric fission .",
    "it is also possible to observe in figs . 4 and 5 that a better agreement between calculation and data is achieved for the lower endpoint energy .",
    "this can be due to the fact that the parameters used in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are based on a systematic analysis for low energy fission , which may not be as good for higher energies . to a lesser extent , by comparing the results for @xmath0th with those for @xmath1u , one can observe that for uranium the agreement with data is better for both endpoint energies .",
    "this also can be due to the fact that the systematics used to set the parameters was done for @xmath76 , and the results extrapolated to lower mass .",
    "it is possible to conclude that the values for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 are somewhat overestimated .",
    "another parameter that can be used to compare data and calculations is the integrated total fission yield @xmath80 , given by :    @xmath81    the result of this calculation together with data on total fission yields in units of mb per equivalent quanta ( mb / eq.q ) as well as some other calculated quantities and their corresponding experimental values are listed in table ii for comparison .    at intermediate energies",
    "the discrepancy between experiment and calculation becomes larger for all observed parameters , except for total fission yield values .",
    "the reason for this can be due to the character of bremsstrahlung .",
    "as the later has a continuous spectrum , the measurements at high energy include also low - energy photons .",
    "from the calculated mass distribution it can be concluded that the model underestimates the low - energy part of the bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "the calculated mean mass number of distributions after evaporation of post - scission neutrons ( @xmath26)@xmath82 is shifted to lower masses in comparison to the experimental ones with increasing energy .",
    "it means that the yields of symmetric fission fragments grow faster , because of the considerable amount of high - energy photons .    moreover , we also calculated the mass - yield distribution of the fissioning nuclei , before they undergo fission , which are shown in fig .",
    "6 . this figure allows the comparison of the fissioning system distributions for thorium and uranium targets at both endpoint energies .",
    "these distributions result from a complex balance between evaporation and fission processes .",
    "apart from the obvious fact that there are no fissioning nucleus with mass @xmath83 for the case of @xmath0th , the fissioning nucleus distribution extends much below the range of those systems in the case of @xmath1u .",
    "it is clear that low mass nucleus fragments are more abundant in the case of thorium fission distribution than in the case of uranium .",
    "one of the consequences of the predominance of low mass nuclei in the evaporation chain for @xmath0th is a relatively lower peak to valley ratio , @xmath84 , with respect to that of uranium .",
    "another important concern is that the uncertainties due to the extrapolation of the values for the parameters in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which is based on the systematic analysis for @xmath76 , are larger in the case of thorium than in the case of uranium . these facts together",
    "can explain why the results presented here for @xmath1u are in better agreement with data than for @xmath0th .",
    "the nature of the interaction of photons and hadrons with nuclei is very different but , the fission process , as mentioned , depends mostly on the excitation of the fissioning nucleus .",
    "thus , to compare data of fission induced by different particles it is useful to use systems with equivalent excitation energy .",
    "our result of fission induced by photons with endpoint energy of 50 mev on @xmath1u and @xmath0th are , thus , compared with fission induced by low energy protons , neutrons and alpha particles on the same targets @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics of mass distributions such as widths of different fission modes , position parameter @xmath77 of asymmetric modes and the average mass number of fragments for the symmetric component , @xmath17 , are in good agreement among these data , giving a clear indication that it is not the incident particle but the structure of the fissioning nucleus and the characteristics of the fragments which determine the mass distribution .",
    "a detailed calculation with a statistical model of multi - modal fission was performed for intermediate energy neutrons ( 200 mev ) by maslov @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the largest contribution was obtained for the total fission cross section events with the emission of 5 - 7 neutrons on average .",
    "this result is in good agreement with our photo - fission data for 3500 mev photons ( excitation energy around 120 mev ) on both @xmath1u and @xmath0th targets , where the average number of prefission neutrons is 5 .",
    "another comparison that can be made with reactions induced by different probes on @xmath1u and @xmath0th is the peak to valley ratio ( p / v ) of the mass distribution , which is an indirect way to interpret symmetric and asymmetric mode contributions for fission .",
    "the experimental values obtained in the present work together with data obtained for fission induced by photons @xcite , protons @xcite and neutrons @xcite on the same targets are presented in fig .",
    "as can be observed in the figure , there is a general trend for all data of different probes indicating again that it is the excitation energy which is more relevant for the fission process than the type of incident particles .",
    "a systematization of cross sections for symmetric and asymmetric fission in a wide range of nuclei , carried out by chung _",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible to use an empirical expression to estimate the probability of the different fission modes . in order to characterize this factor quantitatively , chung _ et al . _",
    "have introduced a critical value of the fissility parameter , in the form : @xmath85    where z , and a are the atomic number and mass of the fissioning nucleus .    thus , symmetry of the fission fragment mass distribution is given , by the ratio @xmath86 .",
    "for nuclei with @xmath86 greater than the critical value , given by eq .",
    "( [ critical_fission_parameter ] ) , the symmetric fission mode is dominant , while for values below the critical fissility parameter , the fission dynamics led predominantly to asymmetric fragment distributions . for @xmath1u , the parameter ( @xmath86)@xmath87 is 36.3 , and for @xmath0th it is 35.5 .",
    "thus , at low energy ( with an average of no more than three evaporated neutrons ) for @xmath1u it is natural to expect predominantly asymmetric fission . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that the symmetric component of the fission process increases as the excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus increases .",
    "this can be roughly understood as an effect of two factors .",
    "the first one is that , with increasing energy , shell effects become less pronounced and therefore , fission tends to be predominantly symmetric .",
    "the other factor is the length of the evaporation chain , which increases as the fissility decreases .",
    "since the evaporation is dominated by neutron emission , longer evaporation chains lead to nuclei in the proton - rich side of the stability valley , and therefore the fissility parameter , @xmath88 , tends to be above the critical value , resulting in the predominance of symmetric fission .",
    "the fissility of @xmath0th is lower than that for @xmath1u , and then one can expect that the former nucleus presents a longer evaporation chain .",
    "in fact , this can be observed for instance , by the difference of the target nucleus @xmath1u and the mean mass of the fissioning nucleus after evaporation of post - scission neutrons , @xmath89 , which for the endpoint photons of 3500 mev is ten mass units .",
    "the same difference is twelve mass units in the case of thorium .",
    "this indicates that the evaporation chain is two steps longer in the case of thorium . also , looking at the peak to valley ratio ( @xmath84 ) , it is possible to observe that thorium presents a stronger contribution of symmetric fission when compared with that for uranium .    according to the well - known concept ,",
    "the fissility is determined as the ratio of the fission yield and the yield of total photon absorption in a nucleus ( @xmath77=@xmath90/@xmath91 ) . in fig .",
    "8 we plot this fissility @xmath77 for the @xmath1u and @xmath0th targets , from the present work , together with data for proton - induced fission of @xmath92am , @xmath1u and @xmath93np nuclei @xcite , as a function of the fissility parameter @xmath86 of the fissioning nucleus .",
    "we also plot the estimated fissility by the crisp code for photo - fission of @xmath1u and @xmath0th .",
    "for the case of @xmath1u one can see that the fission probabilities are about the same , independently of the projectile used to excite the nuclear matter .",
    "the calculated fissilities for the thorium target are very close to the experimental values at both energies within the uncertainties .",
    "it should be mentioned that the @xmath8 used to determine the @xmath86 parameter is given by the @xmath25 listed in table ii , which are different for the calculated and experimental values . in the case of the uranium target the calculated values of the fissility at both energies overestimate the experimental data , especially for the low energy photons .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to a limitation of the model in taking into account all possible channels of decay of the excited nucleus being considered .",
    "the present version of the crisp code , which takes into account different channels of fission , was used to reproduce different aspects of photon - induced fission on actinides .",
    "those calculations allow direct evaluation of the spectrum of fissioning nuclei .",
    "the comparison between calculated parameters and data has shown that the calculations describe correctly the main characteristics of charge , such as the most probable charge for a given fission product mass chain and the width parameter for the photo - induced fission of @xmath0th and @xmath1u targets at two very different energy regimes ( bremsstrahlung photons with endpoint energies of 50 and 3500 mev ) .",
    "the mass distribution of photo - fission fragments has been analyzed via the multimodal fission approach .",
    "the results presented in this paper show fair agreement between calculation and experiment . the results of the calculations made it possible to determine the fissilities of the fissioning nuclei and compare them with those from other experiments .",
    "it was found that crisp simulations better reproduce data for low - energy photon - induced fissioning systems .",

    "<S> in this work we present an analysis of the yields of fission fragments induced by bremsstrahlung photons with endpoint energies of 50 and 3500 mev on @xmath0th and @xmath1u targets using the simulation code crisp . a multimodal fission option was added to this code and an extension of the calculation to the properties of the fission products is presented . by dividing the fissioning nuclei according to their fissionability , an approach is introduced which accounts for the contribution of symmetric and asymmetric fission . by adopting this procedure , it was possible to calculate the main parameters for the fission fragment charge distribution such as the most probable charge for a given fission product mass chain and its corresponding width parameter </S>",
    "<S> . also , it was possible to reproduce features of fragment mass distribution and evaluate the fissility of fissioning nuclei for photon - induced fission of @xmath0th and @xmath1u . </S>"
