    "<S> a well - understood and most frequently considered @xcite source of fluctuations is thermal noise that comes from the coupling of an oscillator ( vibrational system ) to a thermal reservoir and is related to dissipation by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . </S>",
    "<S> dissipation leads to the broadening of the oscillator power spectrum and the spectrum of the response to external driving .    </S>",
    "<S> spectral broadening can also come from fluctuations of the oscillator frequency , which play an important role in mesoscopic oscillators . for nanomechanical resonators , frequency fluctuations can be caused by tension and mass fluctuations , fluctuations of the charge in the substrate , or dispersive intermode coupling @xcite , whereas for electromagnetic cavity modes they can come from fluctuations of the effective dielectric constant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> identifying different broadening mechanisms is a delicate task that has been attracting much attention @xcite .    in this paper </S>",

    "<S> driving leads to a @xmath0-like peak at the driving frequency @xmath1 @xcite , because here the only effect of the driving is forced vibrations linearly superimposed on thermal motion . </S>",
    "<S> frequency fluctuations make forced vibrations random . </S>",
    "<S> as we show , this qualitatively changes the spectrum leading to characteristic new spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> we observe these features in a carbon - nanotube resonator and use them to separate the energy relaxation rate from the overall broadening of the power spectrum in the absence of driving , as well as reveal and explore the narrow - band frequency noise . </S>",
