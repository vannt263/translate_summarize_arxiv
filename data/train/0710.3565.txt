    "the status of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) of frw models has evolved significantly over the last year .",
    "specifically , when there is at least one massless scalar field present , the _ physical _ sector of the theory was constructed in detail and then used to show that the big bang is replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "furthermore , this singularity resolution does not come at the cost of introducing undesirable features such as unphysical matter or large quantum effects in physically tame situations .",
    "we will begin with a brief summary of these results particularly because there is some confusion in the literature on the bounce scenario and on the difference between lqc and the wheeler dewitt ( wdw ) theory .    in these lqc models , the availability of the physical inner product on the space of solutions to the hamiltonian constraint and of a complete set of convenient dirac observables led to a precise construction of suitable semi - classical states .",
    "numerical evolution of these states then led to a number of detailed and quantitative results : i ) classical general relativity is an excellent approximation to quantum theory until matter density reaches @xmath1 , or , scalar curvature reaches @xmath2 ; ii ) as curvature increases further , quantum geometry becomes dominant , creating an effective repulsive force which rises very quickly , overwhelms classical gravitational attraction , and causes a bounce at .",
    "however to calculate the quantum hamiltonian constraint these papers used the lowest non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator for the area gap .",
    "it was later realized that the corresponding eigenstates are not suitable for homogeneous cosmologies . on the space of states which _ are _ suitable , the area gap is twice as large , which makes the critical density half as large @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath3 , thereby resolving the classical singularity .",
    "the repulsive force dies very quickly once the density falls below @xmath4 ; iii ) while the classical evolution breaks down at the singularity , the full quantum evolution remains well defined , joining the pre - big - bang branch of the universe to the post - big - bang branch through a _",
    "evolution ; and , iv ) contrary to the earlier belief , the so - called ` inverse volume effects ' associated with the matter hamiltonian are inessential to the singularity resolution in these models . at the planck scale , dynamics of semi - classical states is dictated , rather , by the quantum geometry effects in the _ gravitational part _ of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "( for details , see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "these results also addressed two concrete criticisms @xcite of the earlier status of lqc .",
    "first , although it had been demonstrated @xcite that the quantum hamiltonian constraint remains well - defined at the putative singularity , in absence of a physical inner product and dirac observables the physical meaning of this singularity resolution had remained unclear .",
    "one could therefore ask @xcite : what is the precise and physically relevant sense in which the singularity is resolved ?",
    "second , while the early formulations of the quantum hamiltonian constraint @xcite were an improvement over the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) theory near the singularity , they turned out to have a serious flaw : they could lead to a significant deviation from classical general relativity even in regimes in which the space - time curvature is quite low @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath0=0 model , more the state is semi - classical , lower was the matter density and curvature at which the bounce occurred @xcite .",
    "in particular , for perfectly reasonable semi - classical states , the bounce could occur even at density of water ! in presence of a cosmological constant , serious deviations from classical general relativity also occurred in low curvature regions well away from the singularity .",
    "these problems can also occur without a cosmological constant . as a result , in the @xmath0=1 model it was then natural to ask @xcite : does lqc predict that there would be a recollapse from the expanding to the contracting phase that can occur at low curvatures in classical general relativity ?",
    "absence of recollapse would be an unacceptable , _ qualitative _ departure from general relativity .    because the physical sector of the theory has now been constructed in detail , both these issues could be addressed satisfactorily @xcite .",
    "first , ` singularity resolution ' refers to the behavior of dirac observables such as matter density , whence the physical meaning of the term is now transparent .",
    "second , not only is there a recollapse in the @xmath0=1 model but there is excellent _ quantitative _ agreement with general relativity ( for universes which grow to macroscopic sizes ) @xcite .",
    "these investigations have also shown that , while the singularity can be removed rather easily in lqc , considerable care is needed in the formulation of quantum dynamics to ensure that the detailed predictions do not lead to gross departures from classical general relativity in tame situations @xcite .",
    "careful treatment ensures both a good ultra - violet behavior ( singularity resolution ) _ and _ a good infra - red behavior ( agreement with general relativity at low curvatures ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the ` improved ' lqc dynamics @xcite , the quantum bounce occurs only when the matter density is @xmath5 , irrespective of the choice of semi - classical states .",
    "once the curvature is low , evolution is close to that predicted by classical general relativity also in the presence of a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "evolution ) and the older one ( referred to as the @xmath6 evolution ) appear not to have been fully appreciated .",
    "indeed , some of the recent discussions @xcite portray the two schemes as if they are on equal footing . as discussed in section [ s6 ] , the issue of",
    "whether any of the proposed dynamics of lqc can be systematically derived from lqg is wide open but it is logically distinct from whether they are viable within the confines of lqc . mixing of these two issues has resulted in some unfortunate confusion in the literature .",
    "] however , even within the confines of these simple models , a number of questions still remain .",
    "first , numerical simulations and effective equations both imply that the bounce occurs when the matter density reaches a critical value @xmath7 .",
    "it turned out that @xmath8 is insensitive to the sign or value of the cosmological constant and is the same whether we consider @xmath0=0 or @xmath0=@xmath9 models @xcite .",
    "can one understand the physical origin of @xmath8 ?",
    "is there an upper bound on matter density in physical quantum states which can be established without having to make the assumptions that underlie numerical simulations and effective equations ?",
    "second , the detailed evolution was restricted to states which are semi - classical at late times and was carried out numerically .",
    "therefore , an analytical understanding of quantum evolution has been lacking and , in particular , the precise reason for the striking differences between lqc and the theory has not been fully understood . while states which are semi - classical at late times are the most interesting ones , are they essential for the bounce scenario as some authors have suggested ? or ,",
    "is there a sense in which all states undergo a quantum bounce ? it has been suggested @xcite that the near symmetry ( in intrinsic time ) of volume uncertainties around the bounce point is a consequence of the use of a special class of semi - classical states at late times .",
    "is this the case or is it shared by a much more general class of states which are ( truly ) semi - classical at late times ?    similarly , comparison of lqc and the theory raises a number of questions .",
    "there is a precise sense @xcite in which the quantum hamiltonian constraint of the theory approximates that of lqc .",
    "yet , the physical content of the _ solutions _ to the two constraints is dramatically different : while none of the states of the theory which are semi - classical at late times can escape the big bang singularity , all their analogs in lqc do just that .",
    "what then is the precise relation between the two sets of dynamics ? can one make statements for more general states ? while the geometric part of the hamiltonian constraint is a second order differential operator , that of lqc is a second order difference operator , the step size being dictated by the ` area gap ' @xmath10 , i.e. , the smallest non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator .",
    "what happens in the mathematical limit in which @xmath10 is sent to zero by hand ?",
    "non - relativistic quantum mechanical systems also admit a ` polymer ' representation ( of the weyl algebra ) which mimics the mathematical structure of loop quantum cosmology @xcite . for a harmonic oscillator ,",
    "dynamics in this representation involves a ( mathematical ) discreteness parameter @xmath11 and is distinct from the standard schrdinger dynamics .",
    "however , as was shown in detail in @xcite , it reduces to the standard dynamics in the limit in which @xmath11 goes to zero .",
    "is the situation similar in lqc ?",
    "if so , what is the a precise sense in which the lqc dynamics reduces to that of theory in such a limit ?",
    "the purpose of this ( and the accompanying @xcite ) paper is to address these questions .",
    "two key ideas will make this task feasible .",
    "first , we introduce a new representation in both lqc and the theory in which the operator conjugate to volume is diagonal . in this representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint of lqc becomes a _",
    "differential _ operator just as in the theory ( for the same reasons as in @xcite ) .",
    "second , we will introduce a harmonic time coordinate which is tailored to the scalar field clock already at the classical level .",
    "this will simplify the factor ordering of the hamiltonian constraint relative to @xcite and make the model exactly soluble .",
    "in fact , in the as well as in this soluble lqc theory the hamiltonian constraint reduces just to the 2-dimensional klein - gordon operator !",
    "the physical hilbert space of both theories is then identical ( except for a certain global symmetry ) .",
    "how can the theories then lead to strikingly different results on resolution of singularity ?",
    "the answer of course is that the ( dirac ) observables are represented by distinct operators .",
    "thus , in the new representation , one can compare the two theories just by studying the relation between two sets of operators on the _ same _ hilbert space .",
    "furthermore , in this representation the expression of dirac observables is rather simple .",
    "therefore , one can analytically compute the expectation values and dispersions .",
    "we find that in the theory the expectation value of the volume operator on a _ dense set of states _ goes to zero in the distant past ( or future ) .",
    "thus , for a generic state matter density diverges in the distant past ( or distant future ) . in this sense",
    "the singularity is unavoidable in the theory .",
    "in lqc by contrast , on a dense sub - space the expectation value of the volume operator has a non - zero minimum and diverges both in the distant past and future .",
    "thus , the density remains finite and undergoes a bounce . in this sense",
    "the quantum bounce is generic and not tied just to semi - classical states .",
    "the simplified model also enables us to show that matter density has a finite upper bound @xmath12 on the physical hilbert space ( where @xmath13 is the barbero - immirzi parameter of lqg ) .",
    "this value coincides exactly with that of the critical density @xmath8 @xcite !",
    "since the bound is established analytically and without restriction to states which are semi - classical at late times , it provides a deeper understanding of the bounce scenario .",
    "finally , we analyze the precise sense in which the theory can be regarded as the continuum limit of lqc .",
    "we show that given any _",
    "fixed , finite _",
    "interval @xmath14 of internal time we can shrink ( by hand ) the area gap @xmath10 sufficiently so that the theory agrees with lqc to any pre - specified degree of accuracy . however , this approximation is not uniform in @xmath14 ; the theory can not approximate lqc for _ all _ times no matter how much we shrink the area gap .",
    "furthermore , lqc does not admit a limit at all if the gap is shrunk to zero size . in this sense",
    "it is intrinsically discrete , very different from the ` polymer quantum mechanics ' of a harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "we wish to emphasize , however , that all these results refer only to frw models with a massless scalar field .",
    "we conclude this section with a general observation on singularity resolution .",
    "recall that in classical general relativity , it is non - trivial to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the occurrence of a singularity ( for example , a space - time can be singular even if all its curvature invariants vanish ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that a generally applicable and satisfactory notion of ` singularity resolution ' is not available in quantum gravity .",
    "however , in simple situations such as homogeneous cosmologies the notion of a singularity is unambiguous in the classical theory . in the quantum theory of these models",
    "one can also provide a satisfactory notion of singularity resolution .",
    "first , one should have available the physical hilbert space ( not just the solutions to constraints ) and a complete family of dirac observables , at least some of which diverge at the singularity .",
    "then one would say that the singularity is resolved if the expectation values of these observables remain finite in the regime in which they become classically singular . in the model studied in this paper",
    ", we have a well defined physical inner product as well as a complete set of dirac observables both in the theory and lqc .",
    "in the theory the singularity is not resolved because the expectation value of the matter density diverges at the putative classical singularities while in lqc the singularity is resolved because the expectation values of a complete set of dirac observables including the matter density remain finite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we introduce the new representation in the theory .",
    "section [ s3 ] introduces the simplification in the lqc hamiltonian constraint and the new representation in which this constraint becomes a differential operator .",
    "section [ s4 ] compares and contrasts the theory and lqc and section [ s5 ] provides an analytical understanding of two striking features of lqc . in section [ s6 ]",
    "we summarize the results and compares them with analogous discussions in the literature .",
    "it is well known that the theory of the @xmath0=0 frw models with a massless scalar field is simple because with an appropriate choice of variables the hamiltonian constraint can be cast as a 2-dimensional klein - gordon equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present this theory in a form that makes its relation to lqc easier to analyze . for this",
    ", we will need to introduce certain variables and notation which may appear contrived from the internal viewpoint of the theory , but which will facilitate comparison between the two theories in section [ s4 ] .    to construct a hamiltonian formulation of the @xmath0=0 model",
    ", one has to introduce a finite fiducial cell @xmath15 and restrict all integrations to it @xcite .",
    "it is easiest to fix a fiducial flat metric @xmath16 and let @xmath15 be a cube of volume @xmath17 with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "the standard canonically conjugate variables are @xmath18 for geometry and @xmath19 for the scalar field . here",
    "@xmath20 is the scale factor relative to @xmath16 : the physical metric @xmath21 being given by @xmath22 . to compare with lqc",
    ", we will make a series of transformations on the geometrical pair @xmath23 .",
    "first , it is convenient to fix a fiducial co - triad @xmath24 which is orthonormal with respect to @xmath16 and consider co - triads @xmath25 which are orthonormal with respect to @xmath21 so that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 if @xmath25 has the same orientation as the fiducial @xmath24 and @xmath28 if the orientation is opposite",
    ". second , it is convenient to replace the scale factor @xmath20 by a variable @xmath29 which is proportional to volume ( of the cell @xmath15 )",
    ". let us set [ nu1 ] = a^3 2 ^ 2where @xmath13 is a constant ( the barbero - immirzi parameter of loop quantum gravity ) and @xmath30 is the planck length .",
    "thus @xmath29 has the dimension of length and , because of the orientation factor @xmath31 , is not required to be positive ; it ranges over @xmath32 .",
    "a canonically conjugate variable is given by [ b ] = - 4g3 p_(a)a^2 , which has dimensions of inverse length .",
    "in quantum theory , the corresponding operators then satisfy the commutation relations : [ ccr ] [ , ] = 2i . to construct the hilbert space of states",
    ", we can either use a representation in which @xmath33 is diagonal or @xmath34 is diagonal . in both cases",
    "the hamiltonian constraint becomes a linear , second order differential operator .",
    "thus both representations are simple and neither has a particular advantage over the other . in lqc on the other hand , although the two corresponding representations are again equivalent , in the @xmath29 representation physical states turn out to have support on a discrete set of values @xmath35 , and the geometric part of the hamiltonian constraint is a _ difference _",
    "operator on states @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath37 is an integer and @xmath38 is the square - root of the smallest non - zero eigenvalue @xmath39 of area . in the @xmath40 representation ,",
    "on the other hand , states @xmath41 have support on the continuous interval @xmath42 and the geometrical part of the hamiltonian constraint is represented by a second order _",
    "representation in lqc is analogous to the @xmath43-representation in which the states @xmath44 have support on the interval @xmath45 while the @xmath29 representation of lqc is analogous to the representation in which @xmath46 is diagonal so the the wave - functions @xmath47 have support on discrete values @xmath48 consequently comparison between lqc and the theory is most direct in the @xmath40 representation",
    ". we will therefore let the states be wave functions @xmath49 also in the theory .",
    "( as in @xcite , symbols with underbars will refer to the theory . )    in this representation , the hamiltonian constraint takes the form [ hc1 ] ^2 _ ( , ) = 12 g ( _ ) ^2 ( , ) .",
    "in the classical theory , @xmath50 is monotonic along all dynamical trajectories and therefore serves as an intrinsic clock . as explained in @xcite , because of the form of the hamiltonian constraint , this interpretation carries over to quantum theory both in the theory as well as lqc .",
    "physical states must satisfy ( [ hc1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , they must satisfy a symmetry requirement . under change in orientation of the physical co - triad , @xmath51 ,",
    "the spatial metric does not change and , since there are no fermions in the model , physics remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , this change represents a large gauge transformation .",
    "recall that in yang - mills theory physical states belong to _ irreducible _ representations of the group of large gauge transformations ( i.e. , to the so - called ` theta ' sectors ) . the same reasoning applies to the present case .",
    "however , now the large gauge transformation @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 , whence wave functions are either symmetric or anti - symmetric under this action . used here",
    "are fourier transforms of @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the states used in @xcite . because of the extra @xmath56 factor , @xmath49 are anti - symmetric in the theory ( as well as in lqc ) .",
    "but this fact will not play an essential role in the subsequent discussion . ]",
    "therefore , it suffices to restrict oneself to just the positive ( or negative ) @xmath40-half line . for concreteness ,",
    "let us use the positive half line .",
    "then , as in the standard theory one can simplify the hamiltonian constraint by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath57 which ranges over @xmath32 : [ y ] y : = 1 _ o = _ o e^y where @xmath58 is a constant of dimensions of inverse length .",
    "the constraint now reduces just to the klein - gordon equation in @xmath59 : [ hc2 ] _",
    "^2 ( y , ) = _ y^2 ( y , ) = : - ( y , )",
    ".the physical hilbert space can be obtained by the group averaging procedure used in loop quantum gravity @xcite . as usual",
    ", the procedure tells us that the physical states can be taken to be positive frequency solutions to ( [ hc2 ] ) , i.e. , solutions to [ hc3 ] -i _ ( y , ) = ( y , ) .",
    "thus , if the initial data at the intrinsic time @xmath60 is @xmath61 , then the physical state is the solution [ sol1 ] ( y , ) & = & 1 _ -^ k e^-iky + i|k|(-_o ) ( k ) + & = & 1 _ -^0 k e^-ik(+y ) e^ik_o ( k ) + 1 _ 0^ k e^ik(-y)y e^-ik_o ( k ) + & = : & _ l(y_+ ) + _ r(y_-),where @xmath62 and the subscripts @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote left and right moving states .",
    "the group averaging procedure also implies that the scalar product is the standard one from klein - gordon theory : [ ip1 ] ( _ 1 , _ 2)_phy & = & -i _ = _ o y + & = & 2_-^ k |k| |_1(k ) _",
    "2(k ) .we will denote the resulting physical hilbert space by @xmath65 .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ ip1 ] ) that the left and right moving sectors of @xmath65 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "we will see in section [ s4 ] that physically the left moving component @xmath66 corresponds to the expanding branch of frw space - times while and the right moving component @xmath67 , to the contracting branch .",
    "( had we worked with the @xmath68 half line the correspondence would have reversed . )",
    "it is useful to note that the inner product can also be written as : [ ip2 ] ( _ 1 , _ 2)_phy = 2_-^ y |_1 ( y,_o ) |i_y| _ 2 ( y,_o ) where the absolute value denotes the positive part of the self - adjoint operator @xmath69 .",
    "our next task is to define a convenient set of dirac observables .",
    "since in the classical theory @xmath70 , the volume ( of the fiducial cell ) at any instant @xmath71 of internal time , is a dirac observable , in the quantum theory we wish to define a self - adjoint operator @xmath72 on @xmath65 . with this goal in mind ,",
    "let us first introduce the schrdinger hilbert space @xmath73 by freezing physical states at @xmath60 and evaluating the scalar product ( [ ip2 ] ) at @xmath60 , and define a self - adjoint operator @xmath33 on it .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath40 are canonically conjugate , we are led to define & : = & -2i _ + & & -2i _ o e^- y _",
    "y .using the fact that the operator @xmath69 is a positive definite self - adjoint operator on the right sector @xmath74 of @xmath75 and negative - definite on the left sector @xmath76 , one can easily show that for all smooth functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 which fall off sufficiently fast at @xmath79 , we have ( _ 1 , -2i _ _",
    "2)_sch = -4_o & & _ -^ y + where the integral is performed at @xmath60 . by calculating the matrix element of the adjoint of @xmath80 and adding we obtain the matrix elements of @xmath33 : ( _ 1 , _",

    "we will now use this expression to define a 1-parameter family of ( relational ) dirac observables @xmath72 on @xmath65 :    [ v1 ] |__o(y , ) = e^i ( -_o)(2 ^ 2 || ) ( y,_o ) .thus the action of @xmath72 is obtained by first freezing the positive frequency solution @xmath86 at @xmath60 , acting on it by the volume operator @xmath87 and evolving the resulting function of @xmath57 using ( [ hc3 ] ) .",
    "( the operator @xmath88 is the positive part of @xmath33 on @xmath73 . )",
    "@xmath72 is a well - defined , self - adjoint operator on @xmath65 because @xmath33 enjoys these properties on @xmath73 .",
    "the second dirac observable is much simpler : the momentum @xmath89 . since it is a constant of motion , it is obvious that it preserves the space of solutions to ( [ hc3 ] ) and is self - adjoint on @xmath65",
    ". finally , we note that @xmath90 and @xmath91 preserves each of the left and right moving sectors .",
    "since these constitute a complete set of dirac observables on @xmath65 , there is superselection and one can analyze physics of each of these sectors",
    "_ separately_.",
    "let us summarize by focusing on the left moving sector for concreteness .",
    "in the more intuitive schrdinger representation , physical states are functions @xmath92 whose fourier transform @xmath93 has support on the negative half of the @xmath0-axis and which have finite norm ( [ ip2 ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the basic operators are given by [ ops1 ] ( _ l , _ ( ) _ l^)_phy & = & 2_-^y _",

    "-^ y _ y _ l(y,_o ) e^-y _ y ^_l(y,_o ) .where @xmath71 is an arbitrary instant of internal time .",
    "note that @xmath33 leaves the left sector invariant and is positive definite on it .",
    "hence , @xmath94 .",
    "finally , dynamics is governed by the schrdinger equation ( [ hc3 ] ) .    _",
    "remark : _ in the @xmath40 representation , the entire theory can be constructed without any reference to the constant @xmath58 . in the @xmath57 representation by contrast",
    "the constant @xmath58 appears even in the final theory through the expression of the operator @xmath33 .",
    "( as we just saw , the inner product and the expression of the other dirac observable @xmath91 is independent of @xmath58 also in the @xmath57-representation . )",
    "however , it is easy to verify that change in @xmath58 just yields a unitarily equivalent theory ( as it must ) . to make this explicit ,",
    "denote by @xmath95 the left side of ( [ y ] ) obtained by replacing @xmath58 with @xmath96 .",
    "let us again restrict ourselves to the left moving sector .",
    "then the theory based on @xmath58 is mapped to that based on @xmath97 by the operator @xmath98 : @xmath99 .",
    "this is an unitary map which preserves @xmath91 and sends @xmath33 to @xmath100 , i.e. , has the action ^-1 = 2i ^_o ( -y^ ) _ y^ .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . in the first , for convenience of the reader we present a brief summary of lqc including a short explanation of the necessity of ` improved ' dynamics of @xcite .",
    "these references began with the hamiltonian constraint corresponding to proper time in the classical theory and changed to the internal time defined by the scalar field only after quantization . in the second sub - section",
    "we follow an alternate strategy : we use a ` harmonic time coordinate ' ( tailored to the use of the scalar field as an internal clock ) already in the classical theory .",
    "then the quantum hamiltonian constraint acquires a slightly different factor ordering .",
    "but this difference turns out to suffice to enable one to solve the quantum theory exactly .",
    "( the precise relation between the two strategies is discussed in the appendix [ a1 ] . ) in the third subsection we introduce the @xmath40 representation in which the lqc hamiltonian constraint becomes a differential operator , facilitating comparison with the theory in section [ s4 ] .      as in the theory , because of spatial homogeneity and non - compactness of the spatial manifold , to construct the hamiltonian formulation one has to introduce an elementary cell @xmath15 and restrict all integrations to it .",
    "( this is necessary also in the path integral treatment based on lagrangians . )",
    "let us then introduce fiducial co - triads @xmath24 and triads @xmath101 which define a flat metric @xmath102 and choose @xmath15 to be a cubical cell whose sides are aligned with the three @xmath103 .",
    "symmetries imply that , by a suitable gauge fixing , the basic canonical pair @xmath104 of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) can be chosen to have the form @xcite a_a^i = c^-1/3 _a^i , e^a_i = p ^-2/3 ^a_i where , as before , @xmath17 is the volume of @xmath15 with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath102 .",

    "the eigenbasis @xmath110 of @xmath111 is adapted to quantum geometry .",
    "the _ physical _ volume of the elementary cell @xmath15 is simply @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 and the field strength @xmath114 of the gravitational connection @xmath115 .",
    "the factors involving @xmath116 can be quantized @xcite using techniques introduced by thiemann @xcite in full lqg .",
    "the field strength @xmath114 is more subtle because a fundamental feature of lqg is that while holonomy operators are well - defined , there is no operator directly corresponding to the connection @xcite .",
    "therefore , as in gauge theories , components of @xmath114 have to be recovered by considering holonomies around suitable loops , dividing them by the area they enclose , and then shrinking these loops .    in the earlier lqc treatments",
    "@xcite , this area was calculated using the _ fiducial _ metric .",
    "the geometrical part of the hamiltonian constraint was then a difference operator with uniform steps in @xmath106 , the step size being dictated by the minimum non - zero area eigenvalue @xmath117 .",
    "the resulting dynamics resolves the singularity , replacing the big bang by a big bounce .",
    "however , detailed investigation @xcite showed that this dynamics has several unphysical features .",
    "first , for semi - classical states , the density at which the bounce occurs depends on the expectation value @xmath91 in the state , @xmath118 .",
    "now , @xmath91 is a constant of motion and the higher the value of @xmath119 the more semi - classical the state is .",
    "( for example , in the closed , @xmath0=1 model the value of @xmath120 determines the maximum volume of the universe @xmath121 . the larger the value of @xmath120 , the larger is @xmath121 ) .",
    "thus , more semi - classical the state , lower is the density at which the bounce occurs , whence the theory predicts that there can be gross departures from classical general relativity even at density of water !",
    "second , such departures are not confined just to the bounce . in presence of a cosmological constant @xmath122",
    "they occur also in a ` tame ' region well away from the classical singularity , where @xmath123 .",
    "finally , even qualitative features of the final quantum dynamics can depend on the choice of the initial fiducial cell @xmath15 ( see appendix b.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the cell is just an auxiliary structure needed in the mathematical framework .",
    "therefore , while it is acceptable that intermediate steps in the calculation depend on this ` gauge choice ' , the final physical predictions must not .",
    "the ` improved dynamics ' of @xcite is based on the realization that all these limitations stem from the fact that _ fiducial _ geometry was used in quantization of @xmath114 .",
    "if area in this calculation refers instead to the _ physical _ geometry , the subsequent mathematics realigns itself just in the right way to cure all these problems .",
    "the density @xmath8 at the bounce is now a constant , @xmath124 , which is independent of @xmath119 and therefore has no implicit dependence on the choice of the fiducial cell @xmath15 . in presence of a cosmological constant ,",
    "departures from general relativity occur only if the curvature enters the planck regime ; general relativity continues to be an excellent approximation away from the singularity , improving steadily as the scale factor @xmath20 increases .",
    "thus , the limitations of the older dynamics stem from the fact that it uses a mathematically variable but physically incorrect notion of area in defining the operator analog of @xmath114",
    ". indeed quanta of area i.e .",
    "eigenvalues of the area operator should refer to the physical geometry not to a kinematical background .",
    "it turns out that the geometrical part of the ` improved ' hamiltonian constraint @xcite is a difference operator with uniform step size , but now in volume ( @xmath125 ) rather than @xmath106 ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to use a representation in which states are wave functions @xmath127 , where @xmath29 is given by ( [ nu1 ] ) , so that the operator @xmath128 measuring the volume of the elementary cell @xmath15 is given by in terms of which volume eigenvalues are @xmath129 where @xmath130 . thus , @xmath131 is related to the present @xmath29 by @xmath132 .",

    "( ) = 2 ^ 2 || ( ) . as before ,",
    "the variable @xmath40 of ( [ b ] ) is canonically conjugate to @xmath29 . however , whereas @xmath81 is a well - defined operator , @xmath34 is no longer well - defined in lqc because now there is no operator corresponding to the connection .",
    "nevertheless , since the holonomies are well - defined , @xmath133 is a well - defined operator , with action [ hol ] ( ) = ( + 2 ) where @xmath38 is an arbitrary parameter with dimensions of length .",
    "since we wish to use the scalar field @xmath50 as an internal time variable and since @xmath50 satisfies the wave equation @xmath134 , it is natural to use a harmonic gauge in which the time variable @xmath135 satisfies @xmath136 .",
    "the corresponding space - time metric takes the form : s^2 = a^6 ^2 + a^2 ^2 where @xmath137 is the scale factor .",
    "( it is easy to verify that @xmath135 automatically satisfies @xmath136 with respect to this metric . )",
    "because the lapse function is now given by @xmath138 , the hamiltonian constraint becomes p_()^2 - 34g^2 p^2 c^2 = 0 .",
    "the key simplification is the absence of inverse powers of the scale factor .",

    "this simplification is sufficient to make the model analytically solvable . _",
    "therefore , we will call the resulting model _",
    "solvable lqc _ and denote it by _ slqc .",
    "this labeling will serve to distinguish the factor ordering used here from that used in @xcite .",
    "the `` improved dynamics '' procedure used in @xcite now leads to the quantum constraint : [ hc4 ] _",
    "^2 ( , ) = 3 g || || ( , ) where @xmath38 is now the ( positive ) square - root of the area gap : @xmath140 .",
    "since one of the goals of this paper is to spell out the relation between lqc and the theory , we want to retain the ability of sending the area gap to zero .",
    "therefore _ we will leave @xmath38 as a free parameter , @xmath141 , rather than fixing it to the lqc value @xmath142 . _    next , as in the theory , physical states have to satisfy a symmetry requirement . under orientation reversal @xmath52 of physical triads @xmath103 , @xmath143 .",
    "this is a large gauge transformation . as discussed in section [ s2 ] ,",
    "following the standard procedure from gauge theories , physical states belong to irreducible representations of the group of large gauge transformations .",

    "let us set @xmath155 .",
    "then , on @xmath156 , the constraint ( [ hc4 ] ) becomes [ hc7 ] ^2 _ ( , ) = 12 g ( _ ) ^2 ( , ) which is strikingly similar to the equation ( [ hc1 ] ) .",
    "note however , that _ we did not _ arrive at ( [ hc7 ] ) simply by replacing @xmath40 in the expression of the classical constraint by @xmath157 as is often done ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rather , ( [ hc7 ] ) results directly from the ` improved ' lqc constraint if one begins with a harmonic time coordinate already in the classical theory .    to simplify the constraint further ,",
    "let us set [ x ] x = 1 ( 2),= 2 ^-1 ( e^ x)so @xmath158 ranges from @xmath159 to @xmath160 . then ( [ hc5 ] ) becomes just the klein - gordon equation [ hc8]^2 _ ( x , ) = _ x^2(x , ) = : - ( x , ) .therefore we can repeat the discussion of section [ s2 ] .",
    "the physical hilbert space is again given by positive frequency solutions to ( [ hc8 ] ) , i.e. satisfy [ hc9 ] -i _ ( x , ) = ( x , ) .",
    "we can again express the solutions in terms of their initial data and decompose them into left and right moving modes @xmath161 ( see eq ( [ sol1 ] ) ) .",
    "the physical inner product is given by ( [ ip1 ] ) or , equivalently , ( [ ip2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the physical hilbert space of lqc is exactly the same as in the theory and indeed the action of the operator @xmath91 on physical states is the same : @xmath162 .",
    "how can there be difference in physical predictions , then ? recall that to obtain physical predictions , we need the action of a complete set of physical observables and , as we will now show , the volume observable @xmath72 in lqc has a _ different _ form from that in the theory . consequently , although the hilbert spaces are mathematically the same , the _ physical meaning _ of a given positive frequency solution is different in the two theories .",
    "let us begin with the operator @xmath33 on the schrdinger hilbert space @xmath75 spanned by the initial data @xmath163 to ( [ hc9 ] ) , where the inner product is obtained by evaluating ( [ ip2 ] ) at @xmath60 . as in the theory , @xmath33 is again the self - adjoint part of @xmath164 .",
    "_ however , while @xmath165 in the theory , it is now given by @xmath166 .",
    "_ therefore , repeating the procedure we followed in section [ s2 ] , on @xmath75 the operator @xmath33 is given by : [ nuhat2]= -2 [ p_r ( ( x ) i_x)p_r + p_l ( ( x ) i_x ) p_l ]",
    ". therefore , as in the theory , the corresponding volume operator on @xmath167 is given by [ v2 ] |__o(x , ) = e^i ( -_o)(2 ^ 2 || ) ( x,_o ) .",
    "a second difference from the theory arises because of symmetry conditions on the physical states .",
    "recall that to qualify as a physical state @xmath168 has not only to be a positive frequency solution but must also satisfy @xmath169 .",

    "consequently , in contrast to the theory , the right and left sectors are _ not _ superselected . however , since the full information in any physical state @xmath171 is contained in @xmath172 , we can conveniently describe the @xmath174 in terms of positive frequency , left moving solutions @xmath175 ( or , right moving solutions @xmath176 ) alone , which are free from any symmetry requirement . in this description ,",

    "thus , the only difference from the theory lies in the expression of @xmath81 and hence of the volume operator .",
    "_ remark _ : a quick way to arrive at the constraint ( [ hc7 ] ) in the b - representation is to write the classical constraint in terms of the canonical pair @xmath179 and then simply replace @xmath40 by @xmath180 and @xmath29 by @xmath181 .",
    "while this so - called ` polymerization method ' @xcite yields the correct final result , it is not directly related to procedures used in lqg . since @xmath29 is a geometrical variable ,",
    "its quantization could be carried out using quantum geometry techniques .",
    "however , @xmath40 has no natural analog in lqg . in particular , since it is not a connection component , a priori it is not clear why the wave functions have to be even almost periodic in @xmath40 nor why @xmath38 should be related to the area gap .",
    "for a plausible relation to lqg one has to start with the canonical pair @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath182 , mimic the procedure used in lqg as much as possible , e.g. , along the lines of @xcite , and then pass to the @xmath40 representation as was done here .",
    "once this is done , _ a posteriori _ it is possible , and indeed often very useful , to use shortcuts such as @xmath183 .",
    "this section is divided into two parts . in the first",
    "we show that there is a precise sense in which the singularity is generic in the theory while it is generically replaced by a quantum bounce in slqc . in the second we spell out a precise sense in which the theory approximates slqc and the sense in which this approximation fails .      in spatially homogeneous , isotropic space - times",
    "the only curvature invariant is the space - time scalar curvature which is proportional to the matter density .",
    "classical singularity is characterized by the divergence of these quantities .",
    "now , the matter density is given by @xmath184 and since there is no potential for the scalar field , @xmath185 is a constant of motion in our model ( also in the quantum theory ) .",
    "therefore , to answer the question of whether a given quantum state is singular or not , one can calculate the expectation values of the dirac observable @xmath186 .",
    "if @xmath187 goes to zero ( possibly in the limit as @xmath50 tends to @xmath188 as in classical general relativity ) , one can say that the quantum state leads to a singularity . if @xmath187 diverges in both directions , i.e. , as @xmath189 , but attains a non - zero minimum , one can say that the state exhibits a quantum - bounce .",
    "while this is a rather weak criterion , it is applicable to any state ( in the domain of the volume operator ) . in this sense",
    ", it enables us to test the generic behavior in the theory and in slqc , thereby going beyond the analysis of @xcite which was restricted to states which are semi - classical at late times .",
    "let us begin with the theory .",
    "as noted in section [ s2 ] the left and right moving sector are superselected and can be analyzed separately .",
    "for definiteness we will focus on the left moving sector . then , for any @xmath190 we have [ wdwvol](_l , v| _ _ l ) _ & = & 2 ^2 ( _ l,||__o_l ) _ + & = & 8 ^ 2_o _ -^ y |_ly|^2 e^-y + & = & e^ + & = : & v_o e^ , where @xmath191 is a constant determined by the solution and can be calculated from initial data at any instant of time .",
    "thus , for any state @xmath192 in the domain of the volume operator , the expectation value @xmath187 tends to @xmath160 as the internal time @xmath50 tends to @xmath160 and goes to zero as @xmath50 tends to @xmath159 . in this sense",
    "the left moving sector corresponds to the expanding universes .",
    "it is obvious from the above calculation that on the right moving sector @xmath193 the situation would be reversed whence it represents contracting universes . in the first case there is a big bang singularity and in the second , a big crunch singularity .",
    "indeed , states which are semi - classical in an epoch when the density is very low compared to the planck density are known to follow the classical trajectories into either the big bang or the big - crunch singularity @xcite .",
    "we have shown that this qualitative behavior is generic : for a dense subset of states , expectation values @xmath187 of the volume operator evolve into a big bang or a big crunch singularity .",
    "this calculation also shows that the matter density , defined as @xmath194 diverges as @xmath195 ( resp .",
    "@xmath196 ) in the left ( resp .",
    "right ) moving sector .",
    "furthermore , the same considerations apply to the expectation values of the density operator @xmath197because , as shown in section [ s5.1 ] , its expectation value has the same behavior as @xmath198 .",
    "let us carry out the same calculation in slqc .",
    "consider any state @xmath199 .",
    "then , we have : ( , v| _ ) _ & = & 2 ^2 ( , ||__o ) _ + & = & 8 ^ 2 _ -^x + & = & 8 ^ 2 _ -^ x_+ | fx_+ |^2 ( ( x_+ - ) ) , which can be written as [ lqcvol ] ( , v| _ ) _ = v_+ e^ + v_- e^- where [ vpm ] v _",
    "= 4 ^2 are again constants associated with the solution which can be calculated from the initial data at any fixed @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath200 are strictly positive ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the theory , @xmath187 tends to infinity both in the distant future and in the distant past .",
    "furthermore , it has a _",
    "unique _ local minimum which is therefore also a global minimum . in this sense",
    "the bounce picture of @xcite is robust .",
    "it is not restricted to states which are semi - classical at late times but holds for all states in the domain of the volume operator .",
    "similarly , since the result is obtained analytically , an apparent concern ( which arose from some observations made in @xcite ) that the presence of the bounce may be related to intricacies of numerics is ill founded . the bounce point and the minimum volume",
    "are given by : [ bounce ] _",
    "= 12 v_-v_+ , v_min = 2 ( v_+v_-)^12 ||||^2 , where @xmath201 is the norm of the state @xmath202 .",
    "next , we note that _",
    "_ + = v_min ( ) . therefore , the internal - time evolution of volume is exactly symmetric about the bounce point for _ all _ states .",
    "for reasons just discussed one would expect that the symmetry would hold also in lqc to an excellent degree of approximation .",
    "this symmetry was already observed in @xcite through numerical and effective equation methods and in @xcite using a simplified model .",
    "however , all these analyses were tied to various notions of semi - classicality .",
    "our results overcome the concern that the symmetry may not extend to general states .",
    "our considerations here refer only to expectation values .",
    "however , the same techniques are used in @xcite to calculate fluctuations of the volume operator and analyze its properties .    _",
    "remark : _ in the theory the left and right sectors are superselected and should therefore be considered separately .",
    "nonetheless , since in slqc all physical states @xmath202 satisfy @xmath203 for some @xmath172 , one may be tempted to consider states @xmath204 which are similarly anti - symmetric in @xmath57 also in the theory . this strategy would however be physically incorrect because of two reasons .",
    "first , the anti - symmetry condition in @xmath158 arises in slqc because physics is symmetric under reflections of spatial triads @xmath116 .",
    "this condition has already been incorporated in the theory in arriving at the @xmath57 representation . secondly ,",
    "if one were nonetheless to impose anti - symmetry in the theory , one would find that this sector does not have any semi - classical states at very late ( or very early ) times because , in this sector , states which are peaked at large volume would have very large rather than small extrinsic curvature .",
    "there is a precise sense in which the equation approximates the lqc evolution equation @xcite .",
    "however , as is well known , the issue of whether solutions to two such equations approximate each other is logically quite distinct .",
    "in particular the equations may be such that initial data satisfying the assumptions needed to show that the two equations approximate each other may evolve out of this regime .",
    "if this occurs , solutions of the two theories may be close to each other initially but could eventually differ drastically . in this section",
    "we will show that this is precisely what happens in our case .    at first this",
    "may seem perplexing because in sections [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] we showed that the physical states in both theories satisfy the ( positive frequency ) klein - gordon equation .",
    "is nt then the evolution identical ? however , as pointed out in section [ s3.3 ] that in quantum theory the physical content of a state lies not in its functional form but in its interplay with observables .",
    "while the action of @xmath91 is the same in the two theories , the action of @xmath90 is distinct ( compare ( [ ops1 ] ) and ( [ ops2 ] ) ) . therefore the theories are inequivalent .",
    "the question for us is : can one arrive at the theory by shrinking the area gap of slqc , i.e. , by letting @xmath38 go to zero ? again , one can not naively set @xmath38 to zero : @xmath38 appears linearly in the expression of the volume operator ( see ( [ ops2 ] ) ) and setting it to zero will make the operator itself zero . rather , we have to work with states and operators together .",
    "let us consider the 1-parameter family of dirac observables @xmath205 .",
    "a _ necessary _",
    "condition for the theory to approximate slqc is that , for any state of the theory , there should exist a state of slqc@xmath206 such that the expectation values of volume operators in the two states can be made arbitrarily close to one another by choosing a sufficiently small @xmath38.=0 , spatially non - compact context considered here , one must introduce a finite cell to speak of volume .",
    "however , ratios of the volume expectation values @xmath187 at two different times or , at the same time but computed using slqc and the theory are independent of the choice of the cell . ]",
    "more precisely , given @xmath207 , there should exist a @xmath208 such that for any state @xmath209 of the theory , there is a state @xmath210 of slqc@xmath206 such that [ lim ] | _ ( ) - _",
    "wdw| < for all @xmath211 .",
    "now , the forms ( [ wdwvol ] ) and ( [ lqcvol ] ) of the two expectation values [ evo ] _ wdw = v_o e^ , _ ( ) = v_+ e^ + v_- e^- immediately implies that if ( [ lim ] ) is to hold for all positive @xmath50 then v_o = v_+ v_- < where @xmath191 is defined by ( [ wdwvol ] ) using @xmath209 and @xmath200 by ( [ vpm ] ) using @xmath210 .",
    "however , since @xmath212 is necessarily positive , it follows that @xmath213 will grow unboundedly as @xmath214 no matter how small @xmath215 is .",
    "thus , the necessary condition for the theory to approximate slqc is violated : the global dynamics of the two theories is very different .    while the simple argument above establishes the main result of this section , it is instructive to examine some details by explicitly constructing a map from @xmath209 to @xmath216 .",
    "for this it is convenient to work in the schrdinger representation at time , say , @xmath217 .",
    "then our task is to construct @xmath218 from the initial data @xmath219 .",
    "fix an @xmath207 and consider the family of schrdinger states @xmath220 of the theory for which @xmath212 of ( [ vpm ] ) ( obtained by using @xmath66 for @xmath172 ) satisfies @xmath221 .",
    "then , considerations in the remark at the end of section [ s2 ] suggest that we set [ flow ] f_()(x ) : = _ l(x+ ) = 1 2_o .",

    "if @xmath223 were peaked at some value @xmath231 , each @xmath224 will also be peaked at some @xmath232 . however , as @xmath38 decreases this peak would shift progressively to @xmath233 .",
    "this change of the functional form of @xmath224 with @xmath38 is the ` renormalization flow ' required to ensure that physics of the initial state remains the same at each scale @xmath38 .",
    "let us now evolve these states . since @xmath91 is a constant of motion ,",
    "the non - trivial dynamics is in the expectation values of the volume operator .",
    "( [ evo ] ) immediately implies that while the difference between the two sets of expectation values will in fact shrink as @xmath50 increases , in the distant past it will grow unboundedly !",
    "thus , the two sets of dynamics approximate each other well only on a semi infinite time interval ( which is finite in the negative @xmath50 direction ) .",
    "what happens when we shrink @xmath38 ?",

    "it is natural to ask if this fact has an analytical explanation in slqc .",
    "we will now show that the answer is in the affirmative .",

    "the fact that the value of @xmath262 is the same as @xmath8 suggests that the answers to the two questions are related .",
    "this is indeed the case .",

    "this is impossible since @xmath300 is an absolute upper bound on density in the physical hilbert space of the slqc@xmath290 theory .",
    "this implies that our initial assumption that the limit exists is invalid .",
    "slqc does not admit a continuum limit ; it is a fundamentally discrete theory .",
    "this establishes the main result of this section .",
    "it is useful to note that , by replacing @xmath301 with @xmath302 in ( [ flow ] ) , the procedure introduced in section [ s4.2 ] leads to a rather natural ` renormalization flow ' relating states of the 1-parameter family of slqc@xmath230 theories . under this flow ,",
    "if the initial @xmath303 is semi - classical in slqc@xmath284 , the state @xmath304 will also be semi - classical in slqc@xmath305 .",
    "the classical trajectories on which the two states are peaked in the future will be very close to one another .",
    "each state will also remain peaked on a classical trajectory in the ( pre - bounce ) distant past .",
    "however , these two classical trajectories will be very different and diverge away from each other in the past evolution .",
    "thus , while there is a bounce in each slqc@xmath230 , the pre - bounce dynamics is vastly different for different values of @xmath38 .",
    "the non - convergence of slqc in the @xmath306 limit shows that slqc is qualitatively different from polymer quantum mechanics @xcite and lattice gauge theories .",
    "the polymer particle example was introduced as a toy model to probe certain mathematical and conceptual issues and by itself does not have direct physical significance .",
    "while it has certain similarities with lqc , there are also important differences . because there is no positive frequency requirement in the polymer particle theory , the physical inner product and the hamiltonian are local .",
    "arguments that are successful in that example simply break down because of non - locality of slqc .",
    "lattice gauge theories are meant to be controlled approximations to the continuum theory . as in numerical analysis of pdes ,",
    "the discreteness is introduced just as an intermediate mathematical simplification . therefore ,",
    "absence of a continuum limit would be tantamount to non - viability of that theory . in lqg on the other hand",
    "the continuum is only an approximation .",
    "not only is there no a priori reason for the theory to make sense as the area gap is shrunk to zero , but within the lqg framework it would be hard to make physical sense of the limit if it existed .",
    "discreteness at the planck scale is a fundamental and essential ingredient of the theory .",
    "the continuum emerges on coarse graining ; ignoring the fine structure of quantum geometry because one is not interested in phenomena at the planck scale is very different from taking the naive continuum limit @xmath283 which corresponds to washing out quantum geometry at all scales .",
    "detailed analysis of the physical sector of lqc has revealed that the older quantum hamiltonian constraints @xcite have serious drawbacks already in the frw models coupled to at least one massless scalar field @xcite . in particular , they lead to physically unacceptable breakdown of general relativity in completely ` tame ' regimes .",
    "the ` improved ' constraint operator of @xcite is free of these drawbacks . within the frw models ,",
    "this improvement is robust in the sense that it extends to situations in which there is a non - zero cosmological constant and/or non - zero spatial curvature corresponding to the @xmath0=1 cosmologies @xcite .",
    "recent analysis has shown that its bounce picture is also robust with respect to the inclusion of a phenomenologically viable inflationary potential @xcite .",
    "thus , the suggestion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the bounce would not persist once a potential is included has turned out to be incorrect .",
    "however , so far predictions from ` improved ' dynamics were all made numerically using states which are semi - classical at late times .",
    "three somewhat different classes of semi - classical states were used and numerical simulations were carried out in two distinct ways , using a variety of values of the parameters involved . while these features had established a certain degree of robustness of results , in absence of an analytical understanding of dynamics , it was not obvious whether the results would continue to hold for generic states .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that they may not @xcite and concerns have been expressed that numerical subtleties may affect the robustness of the bounce @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we obtained an analytically soluble model slqc by adapting the theory to the scalar field clock already at the classical level .",
    "this allows one to consider generic states and analyze physics without recourse to any numerics .",
    "the question then is : does the quantum bounce persist generically and , if so , does it continue to be approximately symmetric about the bounce point ? or , are these features restricted just to semi - classical states ? a natural avenue to explore these questions is through dynamics of the expectation values of the volume operator .",
    "we found that these undergo a quantum bounce for _ all _ states and furthermore the bounce continues to be symmetric .",
    "thus the bounce and its salient qualitative feature are quite robust in the cosmological model under consideration .",
    "more importantly , we could show that matter density has an absolute supremum @xmath245 on the physical hilbert space , given by : @xmath12 .",
    "this is precisely the value of the critical density @xmath8 @xcite at which the bounce occurs in numerical simulations and in solutions to effective equations , both of which are , however , based on states that are semi - classical at late times .",
    "thus the raison dtre and the observed robustness of the somewhat mysterious @xmath8 was clarified analytically .",
    "we could also use the model to analyze the relation between the theory and slqc .",
    "it is well known that the key differences between the two theories can be traced back to the fact that dynamics of lqc incorporates the quantum nature of geometry through the area gap @xmath307 .",
    "the question then is : can one regard the theory as the limit of lqc when quantum geometry effects are ignored by taking the mathematical limit @xmath308 ? since it is analytically soluble , slqc is well suited to probe this issue .",
    "we used the complete set of dirac observables , @xmath309 to compare the two theories and obtained two results .",
    "first , suppose we fix any semi - infinite interval @xmath14 of internal time and an @xmath310 .",
    "then one _ can _ approximate slqc by the theory to within @xmath242 over the time interval interval @xmath14 simply by shrinking by hand the area gap sufficiently . in this sense",
    "the answer to the question is in the affirmative .",
    "however , if one is interested in the _ global _ time evolution i.e .",
    ", if we let @xmath14 be the full real line then the answer is in the negative : no matter how much we shrink the area gap , if we wait long enough the difference in the predictions of the two theories will become as large as we want . furthermore , in terms of global behavior in time , slqc fails to admit any well - defined limit as the area gap shrinks to zero . in this sense slqc",
    "is a fundamentally discrete theory .",
    "the use of a non - zero @xmath10 in lqc is not just an intermediate step to make the quantum theory mathematically manageable .",
    "rather , the presence of a non - zero area gap is a central physical feature of lqc , an imprint of the quantum geometry of full lqg on this symmetry reduced theory .",
    "the dramatic difference from the more familiar lattice gauge theories is that whereas qcd can be meaningfully formulated in the continuum , quantum general relativity can not ; in lqg it is essential to use quantum geometry at the planck scale .",
    "we wish to emphasize , however , that the analysis of this paper has two main limitations .",
    "first , we restricted ourselves to the simplest model , the @xmath0=0 frw cosmology coupled to a massless scalar field .",
    "the robustness refers to states within this model ( although most results can be probably generalized by including a cosmological constant or allowing the @xmath0=1 closed models ) .",
    "the second and much more important limitation is that as of now lqc has _ not _ been systematically derived from lqg . in the lqc hamiltonian constraint",
    ", the area gap enters through the definition of the field strength @xmath114 via holonomies of the gravitational connection @xmath115 .",
    "this strategy is standard in full lqg .",
    "however , in lqc one breaks diffeomorphism invariance through gauge fixing .",
    "while this is the standard practice in all approaches to ( classical and ) quantum cosmology , it implies that we can not directly employ the full strategy used so far in lqg .",
    "the new element which may also be useful in a suitably gauge fixed version of full lqg is that the loop along which the holonomy is defined is shrunk not to zero but only till it encloses an area @xmath311 of planck size .",
    "now the most natural value of @xmath311 is the smallest non - zero area eigenvalue @xmath307 in the class of states relevant to lqc , called the area gap .",
    "however , in this step one parachutes by hand a result from full lqg into lqc .",
    "this is analogous to the procedure used in the bohr atom where one puts in the quantization @xmath312 of angular momentum by hand .",
    "in retrospect , this step is parachuted from the more complete quantum mechanics .",
    "however , a fuller understanding shows that while angular momentum is indeed quantized , its eigenvalues are @xmath313 rather than @xmath314 . in a similar vein the quantization of area",
    "is parachuted into lqc from the more complete theory of quantum geometry in lqg .",
    "we believe that this step will be eventually justified through a systematic derivation of lqc from lqg .",
    "however , just as the correct eigenvalues of angular momentum are more subtle than the ` natural ' or ` obvious ' values @xmath314 used in the bohr atom , the correct value of the area @xmath311 to which the holonomy loops have to be shrunk may have a value different from @xmath307 .",
    "for instance , arriving at lqc from lqg may well require a coarse graining which could lead to a ` dressing ' of @xmath10 .",
    "we will conclude by comparing and contrasting our model with another soluble model that has recently appeared in the literature also for the @xmath315 cosmology with a massless scalar field @xcite .",
    "there , in essence one begins with a classical constraint , @xmath316 , takes its positive square root and quantizes by replacing @xmath105 by @xmath317 and @xmath106 by @xmath318 .",
    "thus one first simplifies the _ classical _ constraint and then quantizes , using rules motivated by lqc .",
    "is motivated by the older , ` @xmath6 quantization ' of lqc @xcite but with @xmath6 set to 1 . however , since it is just @xmath105 rather than @xmath319 that now appears in the square root of the classical constraint , it can not be directly related to the field strength @xmath114 , whence the replacement @xmath320 no longer ` descends ' from lqg .",
    "see the remark at the end of section [ s3 ] .",
    "] by contrast , in this paper started with the lapse function suited to harmonic rather than proper time but then followed the same procedure as in @xcite to obtain the improved _ quantum _ constraint .",
    "therefore , reservations @xcite that the simplified model may leave out interesting physics are inapplicable for the model discussed in this paper . at least for the @xmath0=0 frw models with a massless scalar field ,",
    "the bounce scenario that emerged from numerical simulations in @xcite appears to be robust , i.e. , is not tied to states which are semi - classical at late times .",
    "finally , there are three other key differences between the two exactly soluble models .",
    "first , the simplified constraint used in @xcite corresponds to a difference equation with uniform steps in @xmath321 rather than in volume ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "therefore , it is the analog of the older hamiltonian constraint @xcite used in lqc which , as we discussed in sections [ s1 ] and [ s3.1 ] , leads to physically unacceptable predictions .",
    "second , simplifications of @xcite removes , by hand , the right or the left moving sector of the theory .",
    "this truncation is motivated by considerations of mathematical simplicity but does not appear to have any physical justification .",
    "third , as in lqc , the ` evolution equation ' satisfied by physical states in our simplified model involves the square - root of a positive operator ( @xmath322 ) and is thus fundamentally non - local .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the group averaging procedure used to obtain the physical hilbert space .",
    "by contrast , because the square - root of the constraint is taken classically in @xcite , the resulting operator is local ( in @xmath105 ) unlike the corresponding operator in full lqc @xcite . in the terminology of section [ s3 ]",
    ", while the physical states of the model discussed in this paper have only ` positive frequency ' modes but with both right and left moving components , those of @xcite contain both positive and negative frequency modes but restricted to be either left or right moving .",
    "the simplified model introduced in this paper will be used in @xcite also to analyze properties of fluctuations in volume .",
    "again it will turn out that indications provided by numerical simulations involving states which are semi - classical at late times @xcite are realized by generic states .    *",
    "acknowledgments : * we thank jerzy lewandowski , tatjana vukasinac , jos a. zapata and especially tomasz pawlowski for discussions .",
    "we are grateful to ian lawrie for communicating to us his careful analysis which made us realize that we had mixed two inequivalent notions of square roots of operators in an intermediate step of the last version of this paper .",

    "the research of ps is supported by perimeter institute for theoretical physics .",
    "research at perimeter institute is supported by the government of canada through industry canada and by the province of ontario through the ministry of research & innovation .",
    "in the ` improved ' dynamics of @xcite , one began with proper time in the classical theory ( where the lapse is given by @xmath139 ) and switched to the scalar field time only after obtaining the quantum hamiltonian constraint . in section [ s3 ] by contrast",
    "we first adapted the classical theory to the scalar field time ( by using @xmath323 ) and then proceeded with quantization .",
    "the two strategies yield slightly different factor orderings in the quantum hamiltonian constraint . in this appendix",
    "we will discuss the detailed relation between them .",
    "it will turn out that the difference is negligible on physical grounds .",
    "if one begins with the lapse @xmath139 and then passes to quantum theory , the gravitational part of the ` improved ' hamiltonian is given by ( see eqs .",

    "the difference between the two constraint is less than 2% even for the state concentrated at @xmath346 and decreases extremely rapidly for states with support at higher values of @xmath29 .",
    "finally , it is natural to ask if the simplifying assumption on @xmath332 is violated near the bounce point .",
    "if the violation is significant , then the conclusions drawn from the solvable model could be qualitatively different from those drawn from the constraint used in @xcite .",
    "now , since in the @xmath29 representation _ physical _ states have support only on points @xmath153 with @xmath347 , it follows that @xmath348 is necessarily bounded below by @xmath349 .",
    "this value is in fact attained by the physical state @xmath350 in the @xmath29-representation , or , @xmath351 in the @xmath158 representation . in this state ,",

    "<S> loop quantum cosmology of the @xmath0=0 frw model ( with a massless scalar field ) is shown to be exactly soluble if the scalar field is used as the internal time already in the classical hamiltonian theory . </S>",
    "<S> analytical methods are then used i ) to show that the quantum bounce is generic ; ii ) to establish that the matter density has an absolute upper bound which , furthermore , equals the critical density that first emerged in numerical simulations and effective equations ; iii ) to bring out the precise sense in which the wheeler dewitt theory approximates loop quantum cosmology and the sense in which this approximation fails ; and iv ) to show that discreteness underlying lqc is fundamental . finally , the model is compared to analogous discussions in the literature and it is pointed out that some of their expectations do not survive a more careful examination . </S>",
    "<S> an effort has been made to make the underlying structure transparent also to those who are not familiar with details of loop quantum gravity . </S>"
