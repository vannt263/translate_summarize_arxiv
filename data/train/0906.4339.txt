    "massive black holes weighing from a million to a billion suns have long been suspected to be the powerhouse of energetic phenomena taking place in distant galaxies .",
    "energy in the form of radiation , high velocity plasma outflows , and ultra relativistic jets , is extracted efficiently from the gravitational field of the black hole when gas is accreting from the parsec scale of a galactic nucleus down to the scale of the horizon . since the early discovery of quasars , the accretion paradigm has been at the heart of the interpretation of massive black holes as being `` real '' sources in the universe .",
    "it was also recognized in the late 60 s that the luminous quasars and the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) were undergoing strong cosmic evolution : nuclear activity was common in the past and declined with cosmic time .",
    "no bright quasar lives in our local universe , but a few agns are present with very modest activity , representing the fading tail of the population . from simple considerations on the life - cycle of quasars ,",
    "there has been always the suspicion that at high redshifts accretion was ignited in many if not all galaxies , leading to the commonly held premise that most galaxies we see in our local universe should host in their nucleus a massive black hole , relic of an earlier active phase .    for long times , black hole masses in agns and quasars",
    "have been inferred only indirectly using as chief argument the concept of eddington limited accretion . but",
    "today , due largely to the impact of ground - based telescopes and of the hubble space telescope , the mass of quiescent black holes inside the cores of nearby galaxies including our own milky way , has been measured using stars and/or gas clouds as dynamical probes .",
    "now there is indeed strong circumstantial evidence that massive black holes are ubiquitous in ellipticals and in the bulges of disk galaxies .",
    "astronomers discovered in addition , and most importantly , the existence of tight correlations between the black hole mass and the large scale properties of the underlying host@xmath2 .",
    "it is currently believed that during the formation of galaxies , a universal mechanism was at play able to deposit , in the nuclear regions , large amounts of gas to fuel the black hole to such an extent that its feedback , i.e. its large - scale energy / momentum injection , had blown the gas out , thus sterilizing the galaxy against further star formation@xmath3 .",
    "major galaxy mergers could be at the heart of this symbiotic relationship as they may explain both the ignition of a powerful agn and the formation of a violently perturbed galaxy remnant dominated by stellar dispersion@xmath4 .",
    "galaxy formation is a genuine cosmological problem : the cooling and collapse of baryons in dark matter halos , clustering hierarchically , is the prime element for understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "the time of first appearance of black holes in mini - halos is largely unknown : whether they formed at redshift @xmath5 as relic of the first metal free stars@xmath6 , or later in more massive virialized haloes from unstable gaseous disks or dense young star clusters , is unknown@xmath7 .",
    "what is currently known is that black holes mainly grow from gas accretion@xmath8 , and that bright quasars , hosting a billion solar mass black hole , are already in place out to redshift @xmath9 when the universe was @xmath10 years old@xmath11 .",
    "the new paradigm of the concordant evolution of black holes and galaxies imposes a new perspective : black holes previously believed to play a passive role are now in `` action '' shaping their cosmic environment@xmath12 .",
    "the coevolution of black hole and galaxies embraces a variety of astrophysical phenomena that are now becoming of major scientific interest .",
    "they go from the formation of black hole seeds in the first pre - galactic structures clustering hierarchically at very high redshifts , to black hole growth and feedback in major gas - rich mergers .",
    "but not only .",
    "a new and critical aspect of this concordant evolution is the presence of _ black hole pairs _ in galaxies that form during the violence of a merger .",
    "_ there is growing evidence that nature provides through mergers the privileged habitat where massive binary black holes can form and evolve . _ but why are _ binary black holes _ important ?",
    "the answer is manyfold and is the focus of this writing .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in section 1.2",
    "we introduce key physical scales of black hole binaries on their path to coalescence under the emission of gravitational waves . in section 1.3",
    "we summarize current evidence of dual and binary black holes in the realm of observations .",
    "section 1.4 reports on the quest for the presence of massive black hole binaries in bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "section 2 describes the basic physics of black hole inspiral both in gas - poor and gas - rich environments also with use of numerical simulations .",
    "section 3 summarizes selected results attained over the last years in the study of black hole hardening in pure stellar / collisionless backgrounds .",
    "section 4 shows key results on the formation of black hole pairs / binaries during gas - rich major as well as minor mergers , simulated with unprecedented accuracy starting from cosmologically motivated initial conditions . in section 5 we address a number of issues related to the dynamics of binary black holes in massive gaseous disks : orbital decay , eccentricity evolution , accretion on flight and migration in a circum - binary disk .",
    "section 6 explores the delicate and important issue on the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave coalescence events .",
    "section 7 contains our conclusions and future perspectives .",
    "einstein s theory of space - time and gravity , general relativity , predicts that motions of masses produce propagating waves that travel through space - time at the speed of light @xmath13 .",
    "two masses ( of total mass @xmath14 ) in a binary emit gravitational waves that in the far field zone , i.e. much farther away from the source , perturb space - time with a dimensionless metric - strain amplitude @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance and @xmath17 the orbital velocity ( in geometric units ) .",
    "this indicates that the strongest sources of gravitational waves are the most massive bodies that move close to the speed of light , i.e. the most massive black holes ( @xmath18 ) that move in a binary , with @xmath19 at the moment of their coalescence .",
    "therefore , binary black holes `` created '' in merging galaxies offer one of the most promising venues of producing the loudest gravitational waves in the universe that the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) or / and the pulsar timing array ( pta ) experiment are expected to detect @xmath20 . during late inspiral and final plung - in ,",
    "the black holes become genuine dynamical entities , creating rich space - time structure that remains imprinted in the strain amplitude signal .",
    "the detection of this signal gives unique probe of the existence of the horizon which clothes the interior singularity of the black hole .    according to the _ no - hair _",
    "theorem , a black hole is similar to an elementary particle specified uniquely by its mass @xmath21 and angular momentum @xmath22 ( dimensionless spin @xmath23 ) .",
    "the size of the horizon that varies from @xmath24 for @xmath25 to @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( for a maximally rotating kerr hole ) is very tiny compared to the galactic scale : for @xmath25 , the horizon is @xmath28 , i.e. only @xmath29 ( considering that one pc is the mean distance between the stars in the solar neighborhood ) .",
    "thus only through the detection of the waveforms emitted from `` coalescing '' and `` vibrating '' black holes we may hope to unravel their true nature@xmath30 . with _",
    "lisa _ , black hole masses and spins will be measured with astonishing accuracy@xmath31 , and this claim suffices to explain why binary black holes are becoming now so important not only for exploiting the black hole demography in a cosmological context , but gravity in the strong field regime .",
    "as two black holes of mass @xmath32 and @xmath33 coalesce , a new black hole forms with mass less than the sum @xmath34 according to the area theorem . gravitational waves carry away mass - energy and angular momentum , and depending on the spin , they carry away also linear momentum as the resulting radiation pattern is anisotropic .",
    "the binary center of mass thus recoils back and the relic black hole acquires a kick@xmath35 .",
    "while for slowly spinning black holes and for spins ( anti-)aligned with the orbital axis , recoil velocities are @xmath36 there are spin configurations for which the recoil can be as large as 4000 @xmath37 , i.e in excess of the escape velocity from the largest galaxies : this occurs when the black holes have comparable masses , and the spin vectors have opposite directions and lie in the orbital plane .",
    "_ coalescence _ and _ recoil _ are the final step of a long process of _ slow inspiral_. according to the quadrupole formula , a binary of total mass @xmath14 , mass ratio @xmath38 semi - major axis @xmath39 and eccentricity @xmath40 is expected to coalesce , i.e. to reduce its axis @xmath41 virtually to zero , after a time span@xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44(1-e^2)^{-7/2}$ ] . for two black holes of @xmath45 released during a galaxy merger on a circular orbit at a distance @xmath46 pc , this time far exceeds the age of the universe ( @xmath47 yr ) .",
    "it is thus clear that coalescing binary black holes are interesting astrophysical sources only if nature provides a dissipative mechanism that guides the inspiral from the scale of a merger , of @xmath48 kpc , to the scale @xmath49 below which gravitational waves are conducive to coalescence on a timescale @xmath50 yr : eq .",
    "( 1 ) yields @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath52 schwarzschild radii for a black hole of mass @xmath45 . at @xmath49 , the orbital period ( for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) is of only @xmath55 and the relative circular velocity @xmath56 is far in excess of the dispersion velocity of the ambient stars in a typical galaxy ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the dynamic range for describing the hole s inspiral is so overwhelmingly large and extreme , going from the kpc scale down to @xmath49 , that a variety of processes may conspire to bring ( or halt ) the black holes down to ( or away from ) coalescence .",
    "thus , the main focus of this review is to highlight the _",
    "physical _ and _ dynamical _ processes that guide the sinking of massive black holes during binary mergers down to @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig:3c75 ]    [ fig : ngc6240 ]    mergers occur either in gas - poor environments where collisionless / stellar processes are at play , or / and in gas - rich environments where gas - dynamical processes assist the black hole inspiral .",
    "observations seem to reflect this dichotomy : accreting black hole pairs are seen in elliptical galaxies devoid of cold gas , as well as in ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , prototypes of gas - rich mergers between spirals .",
    "if accretion is triggered along the course of the merger , black holes can give origin to a rich phenomenology , that goes from dual to binary agn activity , in the radio - loud or radio - quite mode , according to their dynamics , habitat and merger type .    with _ dual _ agns we will indicate , in the following , dual black holes that are simultaneously active during a galaxy - galaxy encounter , but are still at large relative separations . in this case they are not physically bound in a binary and so , their dynamics is determined by the gravitational potential of the interacting system . with _ binary _",
    "agns we will indicate active black holes that are at close enough distances that they form a keplerian system in a merger remnant . _ recoiling _ agns have been also hypothesized following the recognition that asymmetric gravitational wave emission leads to large recoil velocities : they should appear as off - center agns accreting from a small punctured disk@xmath58 .      in our local universe ,",
    "3c 75 is a well studied double radio source at the center of the galaxy cluster abell 400@xmath59 .",
    "figure 1 shows the radio and x - ray images of the composite source , and of the host galaxies in the optical .",
    "evidence for interaction between the radio jets suggests that the sources are members of a system undergoing a large scale merger .",
    "_ chandra _ observations have confirmed the presence of two x - ray nuclei 7 kpc apart , and of diffuse thermal emission along the radio streams , indicating that their proximity is not an artifact of a projection effect .",
    "3c 75 is not the only case known of a dual agn : pks 2149 - 158 a and pks 2149 - 158 b in abell 2382 is a dumbbell system@xmath60 hosting two radio cores with extended twin - jets , observed at a projected distance of 16 kpc .",
    "the jets emanate from two ellipticals of comparable luminosity and show signs of interaction with the intra cluster medium . only through dedicated optical and x - ray follow - up observations it will be possible to prove that the underlying galaxies are in close physical interaction .",
    "dual agns have been recently discovered inside the dusty , obscured environment of at least two ulirgs whose infrared emission is powered by an intense star - burst .",
    "the most compelling is the case of ngc 6240@xmath61 , an on - going gas - rich merger between two spirals , shown in figure 2 : _ chandra _ images have revealed that presence of two bright nuclear x - ray sources whose spectral energy distribution is consistent with being two accreting massive black holes ( of @xmath62 and @xmath63@xmath64 ) , seen at a projected distance of 700 pc@xmath65 .",
    "each nucleus is at the center of a stellar disk in rotation whose dynamics implies the presence of more than @xmath66 of stars@xmath67 .",
    "kinematic evidence exists that the two nuclei are not physically bound yet , and that the system is caught in the immediate proximity of its first close passage .",
    "a massive rotating disk of cold gas together with gas filaments fill the space in between the two active nuclei@xmath67 .",
    "mrk 463 is the second case@xmath68 : this ulirg shows clear morphological signs of an interaction between two gas - rich galaxies , and two luminous obscured x - ray nuclei are observed at a projected distance of 3.8 kpc .",
    "the interacting star - burst system arp 299 is a potential third candidate of a dual agn@xmath69 , due to the presence of a highly obscured x - ray nucleus ( in the galaxy member ngc 3690 ) and possibly of a second less luminous one ( in ic 694 ) , at a projected distance of 4.6 kpc .",
    "dynamical mass estimates indicate that the black holes in arp 299 are nested in massive ( @xmath70 ) nuclear gaseous disks of @xmath71 pc in size .",
    "[ fig : ngc3341 ]    while the above cases refer to dual agns in galaxies of comparable mass ( i.e. major mergers ) , dual agns in minor merger are still difficult to observe . despite this , a system of two offset nuclei has been discovered in the disturbed disk galaxy ngc 3341 .",
    "the two offset nuclei have projected distances of 5.1 and 8.4 kpc from the primary center@xmath72 .",
    "one of the two offset nuclei ( object b ) shows a seyfert 2 spectrum , typical of an accreting black hole . this unusual system , shown in figure 3 , can be viewed as a minor merger in action with two dwarf galaxy satellites falling onto the more massive primary .",
    "as the primary nucleus indicates a possible low - level of agn activity typical of a liner , ngc 3341 may be the first candidate dual agn system in a composite , triple minor merger .",
    "the existence of binary agns is still debatable at observational level , and four cases deserve attention .",
    "the first refers to the elliptical galaxy 0402 + 379@xmath73 .",
    "vlbi ( high spatial resolution ) observations have offered the view of two compact flat - spectrum radio sources c1 and c2 at a projected separation of only 7 pc@xmath74 .",
    "two jets depart from c1 , while c2 ( initially interpreted as a bright knot along one jet ) shows signs of variability that are a distinguishing feature of an active black hole .",
    "thus , two massive black holes are powering the radio - emission , and are likely to form a real _ binary _ in a passively evolving elliptical .",
    "the second is the case of oj 287 , a bl lac object present on photographic plates since 1891 .",
    "its complex optical light curve shows a periodic variation of @xmath75 yr suggesting that the engine is a massive binary black hole with the smaller ( secondary ) orbiting the larger hole with an observed @xmath76 yr orbital period@xmath77 .",
    "maximum brightness is obtained when the secondary black hole , moving on an inclined orbit , plunges into the accretion disk that surrounds the primary ; a second enhancement in brightness is detected a year later , interpreted as perturbed gas falling onto the primary . for oj 287 , the primary ( secondary ) black hole has an estimated mass of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) implying an orbital decay timescale via emission of gravitational radiation of only @xmath80 yr .    the third candidate is the quasar sdss 092712.65 + 294344@xmath81 .",
    "no periodicities in the light curve are observed in this source , but a systematic shift of 2650 @xmath37 in its composite set of emission lines .",
    "sdss 092712.65 + 294344 has been presented in literature as first case of recoiling black hole@xmath82 : in this interpretation , the set of very narrow emission lines at the redshift of the galaxy host result from illumination of central gas by the active black hole . moving with line - of - sight speed of 2650 @xmath37 away from the galaxy core ,",
    "the black hole that drags its own accretion disk is responsible of the blue - shifted broad line emission resulting from gas clouds bound to the black hole itself .",
    "this picture is challenged by the presence , in the optical spectrum , of a third set of narrow lines at the same redshift of the broad line system which do not find a clear - cut interpretation . in the recoiling hypothesis ,",
    "tenuous gas moving with the black hole is responsible to the emission .",
    "however , to a closer scrutiny , this quasar offers at least two alternative interpretations . sdss 092712.65 + 294344",
    "may host a binary whereby a secondary ( lighter ) black hole , orbiting around a more massive primary , is fed by matter flowing from a circum - binary disk in close tidal contact@xmath83 . in this picture , the narrow lines that define the rest frame galaxy would still result from the central illumination offered by the binary , the broad line blue - shifted set from gas clouds bound to the orbiting secondary , and the narrow blue - shifted lines from rarefied gas around the secondary black hole that has excavated a gap in the surrounding disk ( as described in section 5.4 ) . under this hypothesis , the mass of the primary has been estimated @xmath84 , the mass ratio between the two black holes @xmath85 , and an orbital semi - major axis @xmath86 pc , corresponding to an orbital period of 340 yr and @xmath87 yr . the binary hypothesis is preferred over the recoiling hypothesis being one hundred times more probable than the ejection hypothesis@xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , it can be directly tested by searching for systemic doppler changes in the velocity due to orbital motion@xmath89 .",
    "a third alternative is that sdss 092712.65 + 294344 is the composite system of two active agns co - present inside two galaxies that are in the verge of colliding at high relative speed in a galaxy cluster@xmath90 .",
    "the four and last candidate is the quasar sdss j153636.22 + 044127.0@xmath91 discovered recently in a systematic search of quasars with anomalous spectra , among 17.500 sources with redshift @xmath92 in the sdss dr7 release .",
    "the quasar shows two clear broad line emission systems separated in velocity by 3500 @xmath37 , plus a third unresolved absorption line system at an intermediate velocity ( interpreted as emission from intervening material along the line of sight ) .",
    "boronson & lauer@xmath91 interpreted this object as a binary system of two black holes with their own emission line system .",
    "elliptical galaxies are believed to be the end product of multiple mergers@xmath93 , though the exact sequence of events that shape ellipticals as they appear today is still uncertain .",
    "ellipticals show remarkable regularities in their smooth stellar light profile : their outer surface brightness @xmath94 follows a srsic profile @xmath95 over a wide mass - dynamical range .",
    "the fit is so remarkable that departures from this regularity has been recently used as diagnostic tool for tracing back their formation history@xmath96 .",
    "ellipticals appear to come in two distinct varieties@xmath97 : bright ( giant ) ellipticals have srsic index @xmath98 and show cores , i.e. _ missing - light _ inside a radius marking the dividing line between a flatter inner surface brightness profile and the srsic profile at outer radii ; the less bright , less massive ( normal ) ellipticals have instead @xmath99 , and show _ extra - light _ at their center relative to the inner extrapolation of the outer srsic profile . missing or extra light are features that underscore a dichotomy that involves not only the central kpc of the galaxy but many global structural and physical properties@xmath100 . core ( i.e. missing - light )",
    "giant ellipticals are essentially non - rotating , anisotropic and modestly triaxial ; stars are very old and if gas is present , it is _ hot _ and x - ray emitting .",
    "often giant ellipticals host strong radio sources .",
    "by contrast , core - less ( i.e. extra - light ) ellipticals are rotationally supported and have disky - distorted isophotes",
    ". rarely contain hot x - ray emitting gas and a radio source .",
    "both local and global features thus appear to record memory of a different merger history .",
    "a number of authors@xmath101 has suggested recently that missing - light ( giant ) ellipticals are shaped by ( re-)mergers of _ gas - poor _ galaxies , while extra - light ellipticals are the result of a _ gas - rich _ merger producing an extra stellar component in the central regions of the galaxy @xmath102 .",
    "extra - light in normal ellipticals is suggestive that _ cold _ gas has played a critical role in the build up of the galaxy : gas can radiate and fall in the central regions of the merger remnant converting a sizable fraction of its mass into stars , in violation of liouville s theorem .",
    "missing light@xmath103 instead does not find an easy explanation : collisionless mergers preserve the density profile of the progenitor galaxies and do not enhance significantly the velocity dispersion , according to liouville s theorem .",
    "thus , the presence of missing - light requires extra physics .",
    "core ( missing - light ) galaxies and core - less ( extra - light ) ellipticals generally host a massive black hole in their nucleus , and an interesting hypothesis has been advanced .",
    "that in a gas - poor environment , missing - light results from a dynamical process involving a _ binary _ black hole .",
    "a first possibility is that a stellar core forms in response to repeated three - body interactions between the binary and a star passing by@xmath104 : impinging on the binary from low angular momentum orbits stars are scattered back with very high velocities and leave the nucleus .",
    "the binary that decays excavates with time the central region of the galaxy producing a stellar core , emptied of light .",
    "the missing light correlates with the black hole mass closely@xmath105and with the number of successive mergers necessary to explain the stellar mass deficit@xmath106 . a second possibility that may operate in succession is core formation due to the recoiling black hole born after binary coalescence .",
    "gravitational radiation not only carries away energy and angular momentum : depending on the black hole spin direction relative to the orbital plane , radiation transports away linear momentum , as waves are emitted anisotropically .",
    "the relic black hole , as already mentioned in section 1.2 , receives a recoil velocity that can be as large as 4000 @xmath37 .",
    "the instantaneous removal of the black hole via radiation recoil generally results in the rapid formation of a stellar core that expands due to the sudden change in the gravitational potential , now lacking of a massive central body , and to the subsequent deposition of kinetic energy as the black hole returns toward the center of the galaxy@xmath107 ( the effect being the largest when the hole is ejected on a return orbit with a velocity just below escape ) .",
    "these ideas radical and ad hoc have become nowadays two mainstream possibilities .",
    "but , how can core excavation be prevented in core - less ellipticals ?",
    "a possibility is that gas has played a critical role not only in creating new additional light but in accelerating binary decay ( if a binary is present ) under the action of gas - dynamical torques .",
    "the working hypothesis is that fast orbital decay controlled by gas prevents core formation ; spin - orbit alignment which is favored in a gas rich environment@xmath108 , brings the two holes in a configuration , prior to coalescence , of minimum recoil , thus preventing expansion of the stellar core at the time of formation of the new , relic hole .",
    "> from the above considerations , black hole binaries seem to be linked in fundamental ways to the dynamics of the stellar and gas components of galaxies , and this motivates strongly the interest on binary black holes not only as sources of gravitational waves , but as key systems in the context of galaxy formation .",
    "mergers occur mainly in two varieties : they may involve nearly equal mass galaxies , and these are referred to as _ major _ mergers , or unequal mass galaxies , i.e. _ minor _ mergers .",
    "both may involve either gas - rich or gas - poor galaxies so that black hole dynamics has no unique outcome but differs in relation to the merger type and environment .",
    "exploring these diversities in a self - consistent cosmological scenario is currently a challenge , and thanks to recent advances in numerical simulations , it is now possible to address a number of compelling issues .",
    "galaxy mergers cover cosmological volumes ( @xmath109 kpc aside ) , whereas black hole coalescences probe exceedingly small volumes from @xmath110 pc down to @xmath111 pc and to the horizon scale ( @xmath112 pc , for @xmath113 ) .",
    "thus , tracing the black hole inspiral in a merger requires simulations with gravitational / hydrodynamical force resolution covering more than ten orders of magnitude in length , and a variety of different physical processes , often not scale free .    following a merger , how can black holes reach the gravitational wave inspiral regime ?",
    "the overall scenario has first been outlined in a seminal study by begelman , blandford & rees @xmath114 , in the context of stellar systems .",
    "four main phases characterize the dynamical evolution of the black holes : ( i ) the pairing phase p in which dynamical friction against the stellar / dark matter background is acting on each black hole causing their sinking ; ( ii ) phase b when the holes dynamically couple to form a _ binary _ and continue to sink due to the large scale drag of dynamical friction ; ( iii ) phase h in which the binary hardens via 3-body scatterings off single stars ;",
    "( iv ) phase gw , the last , when gravitational wave back - reaction becomes important to drive the inspiral down to coalescence .",
    "early studies explored the phase of pairing p , simulating the collisionless merger of spherical halos @xmath115 .",
    "governato , colpi & maraschi@xmath116 in particular first noticed that when two equal mass halos merge , the twin black holes nested inside the more massive nuclei are dragged rapidly toward the center of the remnant and form a close pair .",
    "the drag , initially , is not acting on the individual holes but on the massive stellar - cusp in which they are hosted .",
    "only when the merger is in its advanced stage , the black holes behave as independent point masses and continue to lose orbital angular momentum under the action of dynamical friction .",
    "they further noticed that the situation reverses in unequal mass ( minor ) mergers , where the less massive halo , tidally disrupted along the course of the encounter , leaves its _ naked _ black hole wandering in the outskirts of the main halo .",
    "thus , depending on the halo mass ratio and internal structure of the interacting galaxies , the transition from phase p @xmath117 b can be at some point prematurely aborted or severely delayed .",
    "similarly , the transit from phase b @xmath117 h @xmath117 gw is not always secured even in major mergers ( where also the black holes are expected to have comparable masses ) , as the stellar content in the immediate vicinity of the black holes may not suffice to harden the binary down to a separation where gravitational wave driven inspiral sets in@xmath118 .",
    "all these issues will be discussed critically below .",
    "n - body and monte carlo merger trees simulations@xmath119 describing the assembly of galaxies show that unequal mass mergers are common along cosmic history . as black hole masses , in the local universe ,",
    "correlate tightly with the mass of the host@xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , this implies a black hole mass spectrum ranging from @xmath122 up to @xmath66 and mass ratios @xmath123 in literature , these intervals have not been explored systematically and main emphasis has been given to equal - mass mergers , given the heavy computational demand , and the impossibility , in gas - rich mergers , of using self - similar solutions , owing to the presence of dissipative components .",
    "while black hole masses in the interval @xmath124 are of interest for _ lisa _ astrophysics , black holes with @xmath125 are of key importance for the pulsar timing array experiment ( pta ) , due to their different frequency of operation . while the `` light '' _ lisa _ black holes carry information on how / where they formed along the course of galaxy assembly @xmath126(up to @xmath5 ) , the `` heavy '' pta black holes@xmath127 trace mergers among very massive galaxies present in the already evolved universe , at redshift @xmath128 .",
    "dynamical friction is the main cause of braking of the black hole orbits during the process of pairing , and acts individually on each hole .",
    "this drag arises in response to the gravitational perturbation excited by the black hole on the background of dark matter and/or stars . in the original formulation of chandrasekhar@xmath129 ,",
    "the drag is the collective result of momentum exchange between the massive perturber @xmath21 ( the black hole in our case ) and every single particle of the background . in a collisionless system of uniform mass density @xmath130 and isotropic velocity distribution , the force on @xmath21 ,",
    "acting against its velocity vector @xmath131 is @xmath132 { { \\bf v}\\over v^3}.\\ ] ] the gravitational drag that involves only those particles moving more slowly than @xmath133 ( the term in squared brackets ) , is maximum when the velocity @xmath133 of the perturber nears the 1d velocity dispersion @xmath134 , as the force declines linearly with @xmath133 , and as @xmath135 , in the low ( @xmath136 ) and high ( @xmath137 ) speed limit , respectively .",
    "the coulomb logarithm @xmath138 in equation ( 5 ) expresses the non - locality of the drag as it comprises the whole range of impact parameters relevant for the exchange of momentum in the interaction of the stars with @xmath139 since gravity is a long - range force , @xmath140 is close to the size @xmath141 of the collissionless background , while @xmath142 is the impact parameter for a large - scattering angle gravitational interaction .",
    "dynamical friction expresses the tendency of gravitating systems to reach energy equipartition , so that any excess of kinetic energy ( that carried by the hole ) is distributed among all particles .",
    "restricted to a static , infinite , isotropic and homogeneous collisionless medium , chandrasekhar s formula assumes that the stars / dark - matter particles move along unperturbed trajectories that are straight lines , thus neglecting the self - gravity present in real backgrounds . despite this limitation",

    "circularization in a smooth ( high @xmath342 ) rotating disk is also a clear prediction of these studies@xmath351 .",
    "when the black holes move on eccentric orbits , circularization takes place well before the black holes form a binary and this is a feature peculiar to dynamical friction in a rotating background . on an initially eccentric orbit",
    ", the black hole has , near periapsis , a velocity larger than the local rotational velocity , so that dynamical friction causes a reduction of its velocity : the wake of fluid particles lags behind the black hole trail .",
    "by contrast , near apoapsis , the black hole velocity is lower than the disk rotational velocity , and in this case , the wake is dragged _ in front _ of the black hole s trail , causing a positive tangential acceleration .",

    ", dynamical friction tends to increase / maintain the eccentricity , both in collisionless@xmath353 and in gaseous@xmath354 environments .",
    "this is suggestive that the presence of a rotating gaseous background can be inferred from the smallness of the binary eccentricity on scales of a few parsecs .",
    "a further recently discovered signature of a rotating background is the angular momentum flip of initially counter - rotating orbits@xmath355 .",
    "this has been highlighted when considering the inspiral of a black hole ( called secondary ) moving in a mestel disk with @xmath279 and hosting at the center a primary black hole .",
    "the initially negative angular momentum of the moving black hole grows very fast during the first million year .",
    "the black hole - disk interaction brakes the hole at all orbital phases , because the hole s velocity and disk flow pattern are anti - aligned and the density wake lags alway behind the hole .",
    "the increase of the orbital angular momentum is further facilitated by the fact that , while the orbit decays , the black hole interacts with progressively denser regions of the disk .",
    "the orbit is nearly radial at the time the orbital angular momentum changes sign and this occurs before the secondary binds to the central black hole .",
    "when co - rotation establishes , the orbital momentum increases under the circularizing action of dynamical friction in its co - rotating mode .",

    "accretion can be studied only if the resolution length - scale of the code is smaller than the bondi - hoyle - littleton radius of the moving black hole . if this resolution is achieved , as in a recent series of simulations@xmath355 , its is possible to follow the fueling of the black hole _ on flight _",

    "it is found that as long as the orbit of the moving black hole remains eccentric , accretion occurs at a low rate , with an eddington factor @xmath358 ( defined as the mass accretion rate @xmath359 in units of the eddington rate ) close to 0.1 , due to the large relative velocity between the black hole and the fluid , and is highly variable owing to the presence of inhomogeneities in the gas in the vicinity @xmath218 . only when the orbit has circularized ( and flipped for the retrograde case ) , the moving black hole accretes at high rate with @xmath360 and in a less variable fashion .",
    "thus , two accretion phases are present for the moving black hole : the first is the low / variable state that occurs before circularization ( and/or angular momentum flip ) and the second is the high / constant state after circularization in the co - rotating mode . by contrast",
    ", the central black hole undergoes accretion at an almost constant rate @xmath361 , in the absence of a substantial motion .",

    ", we expect that the fluid particles bound to each black hole form a geometrically thin , accretion disk in keplerian rotation .",
    "since every gas particles is found to carry a net angular momentum in the direction parallel to that of the grand nuclear disk , the size of the coplanar accretion disk can be computed according to angular momentum conservation : @xmath363 , where @xmath364 is the vertical component of the specific angular momentum of the particles bound , relative to each hole .",
    "after circularization , @xmath365 can be as small as @xmath366 pc for the very bound particles , strongly suggesting that both black holes are fed through a thin , cold accretion disk along the course of the inspiral@xmath351 .",

    "a large number of possible electromagnetic counterparts have been proposed in the last few years ( see , e.g. , kocsis & loeb@xmath432 and references therein ) . in this review",
    "we will discuss only few selected candidates , in relation to the dynamical evolution of the black holes during ( the preglows ) and after ( the afterglows ) coalescence .",
    "as already discussed , the dynamical effect of a massive black hole binary is to open a gap in its circum - binary accretion disk . as the binary semi - major axis decays due to the interaction with the disk itself",
    ", viscous dissipation maintains the outer edges of the gap at @xmath433 . only during the last phases of binary evolution , when the semi - major axis decays due to gravitational wave emission , the outer disk and binary evolution decouples .",
    "the distance between the black holes and the inner rim of the circum - binary disk ( still moving toward the center on the viscous timescale ) increases .",
    "if an accretion disk is present , in addition , around the primary black hole ( of an unequal mass binary ) , the secondary creates the conditions for excavating an _ annular _ gap , i.e. a hollow region between the circum - stellar disk around the primary and the outer circum - binary disk . as a consequence ,",
    "the gas orbiting at radii smaller than the outer edge of the inner circum - stellar disk is driven inward under the action of gravitational torques by the inspiraling secondary black hole .",
    "armitage & natarajan@xmath434 showed that this effect amplifies the accretion rate onto the primary that can largely exceed the eddington limit just prior coalescence .",
    "they suggested that a large fraction of the energy associated with this extreme pre  coalescence accretion event is converted in thermal energy of the gas accreting onto the primary .",
    "the increased temperature triggers large outflows of gas , with velocities comparable to the the orbital velocity of @xmath435 km s@xmath275 .",
    "the authors suggest that such strong high velocity outflows can be viewed as clear signal of coalescing or recently coalesced black hole binaries .",
    "armitage & natarajan@xmath434 showed that the evolution of the inner edge of the gap causes a possibly observable preglow just before coalescence . in this section",
    "we discuss the consequences of the evolution of the outer edge of the gap , resulting in an afterglow observable years after coalescence .    when the black holes reach coalescence , the circum - binary disk is free from gravitational torques and starts to spread inwards viscously refilling the gap .",
    "milosavljevic & phinney@xmath436 estimated that the timescale before complete refilling of the gap and the turn  on of observable accretion activity is @xmath437 yr .",
    "they also constrained the luminosity and spectrum of the turning  on agn associated to the binary coalescence event : @xmath438 erg s@xmath275 are emitted between 0.52 kev in the rest frame of the source and for hole s masses in the _ lisa _ band . based on models of the black hole assembly@xmath439 ,",
    "dotti et al.@xmath440 estimated that next generation x  ray missions ( such as _ xeus _ or _ constellation  x _ ) will be able to detect an x  ray afterglow for a large fraction of the total coalescences detectable by _ lisa _ in three years of operation ( @xmath441 9 , 21 , and 28 after 1 , 5 , and 20 yr from the gw detection , respectively ) .",
    "black hole binaries recoil , at the time of their coalescence , due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the possibility that recoiling black holes can produce an observable electromagnetic signature of a recent coalescence , already suggested by milosavljevic & phinney@xmath436 , has been subject of a detailed discussion only recently .",
    "lippai , frei & haiman@xmath442 simulated the response of a thin disk , initially orbiting around a @xmath443 black hole , to kicks that eject the black hole from the center .",
    "in particular they explored the range @xmath444 , where @xmath445 is the kick velocity of the black hole recoiling either in the disk plane or perpendicular to the disk .",
    "the perturbation in the potential well exerted by the black hole recoiling in the disk plane alters the orbits of the particles forming the disk , resulting in the formation of over - density regions distributed over a tightly wound spiral caustic , as shown in the left panel of figure 13 . the density enhancement within weeks after the ejection , can be more than 10 times larger than the unperturbed disk , and moves outward at the speed @xmath446 .",
    "density enhancements are observed also for black holes recoiling perpendicularly to the disk plane ( see figure 13 , right panel ) , but are much weaker ( @xmath447 of the unperturbed value ) , and develops in caustic only after @xmath448 yr .",
    "assuming that the gas forming the density enhancement is shocked  heated , the authors estimated a prompt increase in the emitted luminosity up to @xmath449 , 70 days ( @xmath171 yr ) after the coalescence .",
    "lippai et al .",
    "found also that the converging velocity ( @xmath450 ) of the shocking regions is an increasing function of the radius , so that the spectrum of the afterglow peaks at a characteristic photon energy @xmath451 ev 50 days after coalescence , and grows up to @xmath452 ev @xmath453 yr after .",
    "[ fig : lippai ]    schnittman & krolik@xmath454 noticed that the disk considered in lippai et al.@xmath442 is optically thick , and as a consequence the radiation is absorbed and re  emitted with a thermal spectrum in the infrared .",
    "they also applied their results to cosmological models of structure formation , finding that @xmath455 of these afterglows should be detectable in the _",
    "spitzer , xmm - newton _ , and _",
    "chandra _ surveys .      the presence of a recoiling black hole ejected from its nucleus can be observed in galaxy merger remnants up to @xmath333 yr after the binary coalescence .",
    "different electromagnetic signatures have been proposed : the recoiling black hole can be observed as an off - center qso , if the hole itself is able to retain a punctured disk at the coalescence@xmath456 .",
    "volonteri & madau@xmath457 studied this process in a statistical context , finding that tens of off - centered agns should be discovered by the future _ james webb space telescope ( jwst)_. episodic accretion flares can be produced from the tidal disruption of stars during the lifetime of the recoiling black hole@xmath458 .",
    "[ fig : berni ]    a recoiling massive black hole can also retain a `` hyper - compact stellar system '' ( hcss ) detectable in the optical as a luminous cluster@xmath459 .",
    "the structural properties of hcsss are defined by the stellar distribution function of stars near the black holes prior coalescence , and by the recoil velocity of the black hole remnant@xmath460 .",
    "the authors estimate that the size and luminosity of hcsss is similar to that of a globular cluster , but can reach values typical of ultra  compact dwarf galaxies if the host galaxies are very massive and the kick velocities sufficiently small .",
    "hcsss are distinguishable from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies because of the peculiar velocity distribution of their stars : the internal velocities in a hcss are comparable to the recoil velocity , allowing for velocity dispersions much larger than the ones observed in canonical globular clusters .",
    "the authors use cosmological models to constrain the number of hcsss observable in the local universe , finding that up to 100 hcsss should be present in the virgo cluster , even if only a few could be bright enough to be confirmed as hcsss by spectroscopical follow - ups .    a different signature of a recoiling black hole has been discussed in devecchi et al.@xmath461 . the authors perform n - body / sph simulations of black holes recoiling in massive elliptical galaxies , hosting a hot , x  ray emitting , gas component . they discover that the gravitational interaction between the moving black hole and the hot medium excites a density perturbation in the gas , observable as enhancement in the x  ray emission . if the black hole is moving with a subsonic speed , a nearly spherical distribution of hot particles forms around : this feature can live up to @xmath462 yr .",
    "if the black hole is moving supersonically , it triggers an over - density in the form of a mach cone , as illustrated in figure 14 , observable for few tens of myr .",
    "the possibility to observe these features ( the spherical or conical x  ray enhancement ) depends strongly on the angular resolution of the x  ray detector .",
    "thanks to the high spatial resolution , _ chandra _ can detect recoiling black holes out to the distance of virgo .",
    "the problem of formation and coalescence of dual black holes in merging galaxies goes back to the influential paper of begelman , blandford & rees@xmath114 .",
    "since then , our view on the formation of cosmic structures and of their embedded black holes has improved dramatically .",
    "we are now aware of the fact that dual , binary and recoiling quasars are exclusive signposts of the process of galaxy assembly . their search in survey covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum",
    "has then become compelling , as compelling is a deep understanding of the dynamics of their formation , at theoretical level .",
    "this review has touched key aspects of the long journey traveled by the black holes on their path to coalescence , highlighting its complexity .",
    "the processes that are conducive , in merging galaxies , to black hole coalescence are heterogeneous as the physical / dynamical range that needs to be covered is enormous , going from the scale of a cosmic merger ( @xmath48 kpc ) down to the tiny volume of a galaxy s nuclear region of @xmath463 pc . only below this small scale ,",
    "gravitational waves alone drive the black hole to coalescence . given the complexity of the problem , a step ahead has been carried out in recent years thanks to major advances in numerical simulations . despite this effort there is no simulation at present that is capable of following the pairing process in full realism , either in pure stellar / gas - poor as well as in gas - rich environments , from self - consistent cosmological conditions .    in stellar backgrounds",
    "there is still the need to explore in greater detail loss cone refilling in the time - varying non - axisymmetric gravitational potentials that form in the aftermath of a merger , and the role of instabilities and of massive perturbers created in situ . on a smaller scale ,",
    "when few body interactions become important , there is also the need to include post - newtonian black hole dynamics , as indicated in in a recent study@xmath464 . in gas - rich backgrounds",
    ", dissipation is known to play a key role in speeding black hole inspiral , but often the thermodynamical description of the gas has been treated in simple , idealized terms : the gas is multi - phase and star formation , together with stellar / agn feedback may play a critical role in affecting the actual dynamics of the black holes .",
    "the inclusion of these composite effects is a must for the future , and we are working on these lines .",
    "low mass black holes at high redshifts are likely to pair in gas - rich halos , while high mass black holes at lower redshifts likely pair in gas - poor stellar backgrounds . thus exploring the dynamics in different habitat",
    "is of major importance .    the search of dual",
    ", binary and recoiling black holes , fed through accretion , will continue : imaging of galaxies in close interaction may unveil the presence of pairing black holes on kpc scales .",
    "spectroscopically , the presence of large doppler displacements in the emission line systems of quasars and agns@xmath465 may reveal the presence of black holes in close orbital motion on scales close to a parsec .",
    "a major advance will come from _ lisa _ in space and the pulsar timing array experiment on earth .",
    "pulsar timing array will detect the emission of very massive black holes many year before coalescence ( @xmath466 yr ) , while lisa will detect the last year of inspiral and the final rapid coalescence .",
    "thus , we have tools to trace the entire dynamical evolution of black holes using both the electromagnetic and gravitational wave windows .",
