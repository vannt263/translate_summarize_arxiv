    "the simplest and most attractive general relativistic model that explains the late time accelerated expansion of the universe [ 1 ] is the @xmath1cdm model where @xmath1 denotes the positive cosmological constant with a value of nearly @xmath2 [ 2 ] and cdm refers to cold dark matter .",
    "the @xmath1cdm model is more or less consistent with all the current cosmological observations [ 3 ] though the origin of cosmological constant still remains elusive [ 4 ] and is one of the most pressing problems in modern physics .    in the presence of a repulsive cosmological constant ( positive ) ` @xmath1 ' the spacetime geometry exterior to a static spherically symmetric",
    "metric is schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) , which describes an isolated black hole ( bh ) in a spatially inflated universe , rather than schwarzschild metric .",
    "therefore , the cosmological constant may affect any local gravitational phenomenon like perihelion shift of the orbits of gravitationally bound systems [ 5 ] , gravitational bending of light [ 6 ] , geodetic precession [ 5 ] etc . , but the general perception is that owing to its tiny value , cosmological constant does not lead to any significant observable effects in a local gravitational phenomenon . in solar system",
    "the influence of cosmological constant is known to be maximum in the case of perihelion shift of mercury orbit where the @xmath1 contribution is about @xmath3 of the total shift [ 5 ] .",
    "however , the contribution of repulsive @xmath1 could be significant ( larger than the second order term ) even in a local gravitational phenomenon when kiloparsecs to megaparsecs - scale distances are involved , such as the gravitational bending of light by cluster of galaxies [ 7 ] .",
    "the study of particle dynamics in sds spacetime shows a significant contribution of @xmath1 when kiloparsecs - scale distance is involved [ 8,9 ] .",
    "the trajectories of both small and large magellanic clouds in the gravitational field of the milky way are affected significantly ( @xmath4 level or higher ) by @xmath1 [ 10 ] .",
    "cosmological constant also leads to non - spherical effects with non - negligible contributions on the local dynamics of clusters and superclusters [ 11 ] .",
    "some authors claimed [ 12 ] that the repulsive @xmath1 is responsible for significantly lower value ( @xmath5 ) of hubble parameter in our close neighborhood than its large - scale value ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the cosmological constant also influences gravitational equilibrium [ 13 ] .",
    "a plausible local scenario where cosmological constant may contribute significantly is the relativistic accretion phenomena around massive bhs which involve distance - scale of the order of hundreds of parsecs or even more .",
    "this is because the asymptotic character of the bh spacetime changes significantly in the presence of cosmological constant [ 7 ] .",
    "note that the accretion of matter on to bh is believed to act as the engine for the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "a few studies have been carried out so far to investigate the effect of @xmath1 in astrophysical jet / accretion flow paradigm [ 14 - 19 ] .",
    "it was found that the presence of cosmological constant leads to suppression of black hole evaporation [ 14 ] ; instead of evaporation black hole will accrete energy .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 on the dynamics of kiloparsecs to megaparsecs - scale astrophysical jets would be worth intriguing to investigate as suggested by stuchlk , slay and hledk [ 15 ] .",
    "their work indicated that positive @xmath1 can have strong collimation effect on jets .",
    "rezzolla et al .",
    "[ 16 ] have analyzed the effect of @xmath1 on the dynamical stability of a geometrically thick accretion disk with constant angular momentum around a sds bh .",
    "their work showed that @xmath1 introduces an outflow of matter through the outer cusp of disk causing a considerable impact on the runway instability .",
    "slobodov et al .",
    "[ 17 ] demonstrated that characteristic peaks in the iron line profile generated in the bh accretion disk in a sds background are less noticeable and distinguishable with the increase in the value of @xmath1 . in an interesting scenario , karkowski and malec",
    "[ 18 ] and mach , malec and karkowski [ 19 ] have recently explored the possible dependence of @xmath1 on relativistic bondi - type accretion flow around a nonrotating bh .",
    "they defined a quasilocal mass accretion rate and found that @xmath1 suppresses the mass accretion rate of the flow and dramatically impacts the transonic nature of the accretion flow .",
    "all the works on the effect of @xmath1 on accreting systems are carried out under some restricted conditions / situations .",
    "this is because the study of accreting bh systems involves solving general relativistic ( gr ) hydrodynamic / magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in a strong gravitational field regime .",
    "owing to the complex and nonlinear character of the underlying equations in gr regime , analytical / quasi numerical treatment of the problem is virtually discarded .",
    "even numerical simulation is complicated by several issues such as different characteristic time scales for propagating modes of general relativity and relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "several early works on these accretion related phenomena were based on pure newtonian gravity .",
    "a few gr effects were incorporated ad hocly .",
    "after the seminal work of paczyski and witta [ 20 ] , most of the authors treated accretion and its related processes around bhs using hydrodynamical / mhd equations in the newtonian framework by using some pnps which are essentially modification of newtonian gravitational potential developed with the objective to reproduce ( certain ) features of relativistic gravitation .",
    "this is to avoid gr gas dynamical equations , which in most occasions become inconceivable in practice in describing a complex physical system like accreting plasma .",
    "consequently , adopting pnps , one can comprehensively construct more realistic accretion flow models in simple newtonian paradigm , while the corresponding pnp would capture the essential gr effects in the vicinity of the compact objects . instead of pnps",
    ", some authors simply use parameterized post newtonian ( ppn ) expansion up to a certain order [ 21 ] .",
    "since the ppn expansion converges very slowly , the latter option is valid only for orbits at large distances , but not for particle trajectories in the vicinity of the bhs .",
    "several pnps exist in the astrophysical literature which are mostly prescribed either in an ad hoc manner or are devised employing certain explicit method [ 20,22 - 33 ] , mostly developed for schwarzschild and kerr bhs . a pnp corresponding to sds metric has also been prescribed [ 34 ] based on the method in [ 30 - 32 ] for a keplerian rotation flow which can be more appropriately used to study gas dynamical properties of accretion disk , and thereby concentrating mostly in its use in accretion tori [ 35 ] , though it has also been recently used to investigate the influence of the repulsive cosmological constant on the kinematics of small and large magellanic cloud [ 10 ] . although notionally pnps are aimed at mimicking gr geometries , however , they , in general , are devoid of their uniqueness to effectively describe the gr features in its entirety . to replicate gr features ,",
    "pnps lay emphasize mostly to reproduce marginally stable and marginally bound orbits .",
    "moreover , in general , they are unable to reproduce observationally verified tests in general relativity like geodetic precession , gravitational bending of light or gravitational time delay .",
    "if the effects of cosmological constant need to be properly revealed in different astrophysical phenomena in local galactic - scales circumventing the complex gr treatment , it is desirable to have a correct newtonian analogous like potential corresponding to sds geometry that will reproduce all the salient features of the sds metric with reasonable accuracy and extensively mimic a wide spectrum of gr behavior .",
    "recently , tejeda and rosswog [ 36 ] derived a generalized effective potential for a schwarzschild bh based on a proper axiomatic procedure . their generalized potential , which has an explicit dependence on radial velocity and orbital angular velocity of test particle , reproduces exactly several relativistic features of corresponding schwarzschild geometry .",
    "later , the work has been extended for the kerr bh [ 37 ] . in the present work",
    ", we would derive a modified newtonian like potential from the conserved hamiltonian of the test particle motion [ 36 ] , which would then be an approximate relativistic potential analogue corresponding to the sds metric .",
    "we would show from a detailed investigation that the derived potential , which depends on the velocity of the test particle , reproduces almost all of the corresponding gr features with remarkable accuracy .",
    "it would be worthy enough to explore the feasibility of measurement of cosmological constant in local - scales or in galactic - scales , and further to explore its influence on the dynamics on kiloparsecs - scale structure and beyond in the local - galaxies , or the accretion related scenarios / conditions where cosmological constant may contribute significantly , in which case , the proposed modified newtonian like potential analogue to sds geometry considering it as a background metric , would be of remarkable use .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    ", we would formulate the approximate relativistic potential analogue in the newtonian framework corresponding to both sds and schwarzschild anti - de sitter ( sads ) spacetimes simultaneously , starting from the conserved hamiltonian of the system in the low energy limit of the test particle motion [ 36 ] .",
    "subsequently in  , we evaluate the geodesic equations of motion and extensively analyze their solutions corresponding to sds geometry , with both our analogous potential and general relativity , for the current accepted value of @xmath0 . in  we explicitly investigate the influence of repulsive @xmath1 on bondi accretion rate .",
    "finally , we end in  with comments and discussion .",
