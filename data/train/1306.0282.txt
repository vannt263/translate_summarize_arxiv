    "the boundary element method ( bem ) has been a most important numerical method in science and engineering .",
    "its unique advantages includes the highly accurate solution on the boundary , the reduction of dimensionality , and the incomparable superior in solving infinite or semi - infinite field problems , etc .",
    "historically , relatively low - order discretizations have been used with geometries modelled using first order elements and surface variables modelled to zero or first order on those elements .",
    "recently , however , there has been increasing interest in the use of high order methods , in order to obtain extra digits of precision with comparatively small additional effort .",
    "successful usage are seen in acoustics @xcite , electromagnetics @xcite , elasticity @xcite , aerodynamics @xcite , to name a few .",
    "one of the main difficulties in using high order bem is the lack of efficient methods for accurately evaluating various singular integrals over curved elements . for the well - developed low order methods",
    ", there is no great difficulty since robust analytical and numerical integration schemes are generally available for planar elements @xcite .",
    "when concerned with high order elements , however , a fully numerical method is required ; various techniques have been proposed , for example , the singularity subtraction @xcite , special purpose quadrature @xcite and the variable transformation methods @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "guiggiani _ et al _ proposed a unified formula ( guiggiani s method for short ) for treating various order of singular integrals on curved elements .",
    "it is a singularity subtraction method , and has found extensive use in bem . in this method the singular parts are extracted from the integrand and treated analytically .",
    "the remaining parts are regular so that conventional gaussian quadrature can be employed , but the number of quadrature points needed would be large , depending on the regularity of the associated integrands .",
    "the special purpose quadrature can be used to substantially reduce the number of quadrature points , besides it is more robust and highly accurate .",
    "most recently , james bremer @xcite proposed such a method which can achieve machine precision .",
    "the problem with the special purpose quadrature is that its construction somewhat complicated and time - consuming .",
    "variable transformation method , also known as singularity cancelation , eliminate the singularity of the integrand by the null jacobian at the field point through a proper change of variables .",
    "although simple to implement , it is generally hard to be used in handling hypersingular integrals .    in most existing integration methods , including those mentioned above , polar coordinates transformation ( pct ) always serves as a common base @xcite .",
    "it converses the surface integral into a double integral in radial and angular directions .",
    "many works have been done on dealing with the singularity in the radial direction ; numerical integration on the angular direction , however , still deserves more attention .",
    "in fact , after singularity cancelation or subtraction , although the integrand may behaves very well in the radial direction , its behavior in the angular direction would be much worst , so that too many quadrature points are needed .",
    "especially when the field point lies close to the boundary of the element , one can clearly observe near singularity of the integrand in the angular direction .",
    "unfortunately , this case is frequently encountered in using high order elements , especially for non - conform elements as will be demonstrated by a nystrm bem in this paper .",
    "similar problems have been considered in work about the nearly singular bem integrals .",
    "effective methods along this line are the subdivision method @xcite , the hayami transformation @xcite , the sigmoidal transformation @xcite , etc . for the singular bem integrals ,",
    "the angular transformation has been used for computing weakly singular integrals over planar element @xcite .",
    "another problem of the pct is how to find a proper planar domain to establish the polar coordinates . in usual practice ,",
    "the integral is carried out over standard reference domain ( i.e. , triangle in this paper ) in intrinsic coordinates . however",
    ", the reference triangle is independent of the shape of the curved element , and thus the distortion of the element is brought into the integrand , which can cause near singularity in the angular direction .",
    "consequently , the performance of quadratures is highly sensitive to the shape of element .",
    "the above two problems in the angular direction were considered and resolved by special purpose quadrature rule in @xcite ; whereas , as mentioned before , the algorithm has its own overhead .    in this paper , two strategies",
    "are proposed to overcome two problems in the angular direction , respectively .",
    "first , a conformal transformation is carried out to map the curved physical element onto a planar integration domain .",
    "since it is conformal at the field point , the resultant integration domain perseveres the shape of the curved element .",
    "second , a new sigmoidal transformation is introduced to alleviate the near singularity caused by the closeness of the field point to the element boundary .",
    "the two proposed techniques , when combined with guiggiani s method , lead to a unified , efficient and robust numerical integration methods for various singular integrals in high order bem . as a byproduct of the conformal transformation , the line integral in guiggiani s method can be evaluated in close form .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the nystrm bem for acoustics and singular integrals encountered are reviewed in section [ bem ] .",
    "section [ polar coordinates ] describes the guiggiani s unified framework for treating various order of singular integrals , with emphasis on the two reasons which render the poor performance of polar coordinates methods .",
    "two efficient transformations which represent the main contribution of this paper are proposed in section [ integral ] .",
    "numerical examples are given in section [ examples ] to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the present methods .",
    "section [ conclusions ] concludes the paper with some discussions .",
    "the method presented in this paper will be used in solving the acoustic burton - miller bie , which is briefly recalled here .",
    "the bie is solved by using the nystrm method with the domain boundary being partitioned into curved quadratic elements .",
    "various singular integrals that will be treated in the following sections are summarized .",
    "the time harmonic acoustic waves in a homogenous and isotropic acoustic medium @xmath1 is described by the following helmholtz equation @xmath2 where , @xmath3 is the laplace operator , @xmath4 is the sound pressure at the point @xmath5 in the physical coordinate system , @xmath6 is the wavenumber , with @xmath7 being the angular frequency and @xmath8 being the sound speed . for static case @xmath9 , becomes the laplace equation . by using green s second theorem , the solution of eq",
    "can be expressed by integral representation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a field point and @xmath12 is a source point on boundary @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the normal gradient of sound pressure ; @xmath15 denotes the unit normal vector at the source point @xmath12 .",
    "the incident wave @xmath16 will not be presented for radiation problems .",
    "the three dimensional fundamental solution @xmath17 is given as @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the distance between the source and the field points .    before presenting the bies",
    "it is convenient to introduce the associated single , double , adjoint and hypersingular layer operators which are denoted by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ; that is ,    [ eq : operator ] @xmath24    the operator @xmath20 is weakly singular and the integral is well - defined , while the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined in cauchy principal value sense ( cpv ) .",
    "the operator @xmath23 , on the other hand , is hypersingular and unbounded as a map from the space of smooth functions on @xmath13 to itself .",
    "it should be interpreted in the hadamard finite part sense ( hfp ) . denoting a vanishing neighbourhood surrounding @xmath11 by @xmath25 ,",
    "the cpv and hfp integrals are those after extracting free terms from a limiting process to make @xmath25 tends to zero in deriving bies @xcite . letting the field point @xmath11 approach the boundary @xmath13 in eq .",
    "leads to the cbie @xmath26 where , @xmath27 is the free term coefficient which equals to @xmath28 on smooth boundary . by taking the normal derivative of eq . and letting the field point @xmath11 go to boundary @xmath13 , one obtains the hypersingular bie ( hbie ) @xmath29 both cbie and hbie can be applied to calculate the unknown boundary values of interior acoustic problems . for an exterior problem",
    ", they have a different set of fictitious frequencies at which a unique solution ca nt be obtained .",
    "however , eqs . and",
    "will always have only one solution in common .",
    "given this fact , the burton - miller formulation which is a linear combination of eqs . and",
    "( chbie ) should yield a unique solution for all frequencies @xcite @xmath30,\\quad { { \\mathbf{x}}}\\in s , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where , @xmath31 is a coupling constant that can be chosen as @xmath32 .      in this paper ,",
    "the nystrm method is used to discretize the bies .",
    "let @xmath33 be one of the integral operators in and @xmath34 be the associated kernel function .",
    "divide the problem into two regions , a region near and far from the field point @xmath11 .",
    "if the element locates in far field , nystrm method replaces the integral operator @xmath33 with a summation under a quadrature rule @xmath35 where , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are quadrature points , @xmath38 is the near field of @xmath36 , @xmath39 is the @xmath40th weight over element @xmath41 .",
    "such quadrature rules can be obtained by mapping the gaussian quadrature rules onto the parameterization of @xmath41 .    if the element locates in near field , however , the kernels exhibit singularities or even hypersingularities . as a result ,",
    "conventional quadratures fail to give correct results . in order to maintain high - order properties ,",
    "the quadrature weights are adjusted by a local correction procedure .",
    "thus becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the modified quadrature weights for specialized rule at the singularity .",
    "the local corrected procedure is performed by approximating the unknown quantities using linear combination of polynomial basis functions which are defined on intrinsic coordinates ( fig.[fig : element ] ) .",
    "modified weights are obtained by solving the linear system @xmath44 where @xmath45 are polynomial basis functions . for @xmath0th nystrm method used in this paper , @xmath45 employed are of the form @xmath46 where , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are integers , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote local intrinsic coordinates .",
    "the right hand side integrals in eq .",
    "are of crucial importance to the accuracy of the nystrm method .",
    "they are referred to as singular integrals when @xmath51 lies on the element , and nearly singular integrals when @xmath51 is closed to but not on the element .",
    "this paper deals with the integrals in the first case , the nearly singular integrals are treated via an recursive subdivision quadrature . when concerned with the first three operators in equation , the integrals have a weak singularity of @xmath52 , while the other operator @xmath23 is hypersingular of order @xmath53 , as @xmath54 .",
    "since various order of singularities appear in eq . or many other bies , it is advantage to find a unified formula to treat these integrals in the same framework .",
    "in such a way , these integrals can be implement in just one program so that the computational cost will be reduced . by expansion of the singular integrands in polar coordinates ,",
    "the three types of singular integrals considered in this paper can be handled in a unified manner by using the formula proposed by guiggiani @xcite . despite of this advantage the method",
    "can be of low efficiency in practical usage ; the very reasons are then explained .      following a common practice in the bem ,",
    "the curved element is first mapped onto a region @xmath55 of standard shape in the parameter plane ( fig .",

    "the limiting process means cpv or hfp integral mentioned before , although for well - defined integral operator @xmath20 , the limiting is not necessary .",
    "according to the geometrical relationship in fig.[fig : polar ] @xmath66 where , @xmath67 is the perpendicular distance from @xmath68 to @xmath40th side of the planar triangle and @xmath69 is the angle from the perpendicular to a point @xmath70 ( fig.[fig : polar ] ) . in each sub - triangle",
    ", @xmath71 equals to @xmath72 minus a constant .    for singularity of order",

    "the integration of @xmath73 must be performed in the hfp sense ; for more details see guiggiani s work @xcite .",

    "the resultant computing formulas can also be written in the above form except that for strongly singular integrals @xmath79 , and for weak singular integrals @xmath80 ( thus @xmath81 ) .",
    "therefore , formula actually provide an unified approach to evaluate singular integrals in bem .    in the double integral @xmath82 and single integral @xmath83",
    "are all regular , thus one may conclude that it is sufficient to guarantee numerical accuracy in evaluating these two integrals , it would be nevertheless too expensive in practical usage , especially when used in high order nystrm method considered in this paper .",
    "the difficulties and the corresponding solutions will be presented in the following sections .",
    "it is the computation of @xmath82 that accounts for the main cost for evaluating the various singular integrals .",
    "the integrand of @xmath82 can be approximated by polynomials in @xmath84 ; that is , @xmath85 the number of terms in this approximation is determined by the kernel function , the order of basis function and the flatness of the associated element .",
    "the relative flatness of element is a basic requirement in bem in order to guarantee the accuracy .",
    "consequently , it appears that the integrand of @xmath82 can be well approximated by low order polynomials in @xmath84 in solving many problems including laplace , helmholtz , elasticity and so forth , using quadratic elements .",
    "this implies that low order gaussian quadratures are sufficient for numerical integration in @xmath84 .    in angular @xmath72 direction , however , two difficulties are frequently encountered which severely retard the convergence rate of gaussian quadratures . to show this , preforming integration in @xmath84 in one obtains @xmath86",
    "the difficulties in computation of @xmath82 are caused by the near singularities of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "specifically , let @xmath93 , @xmath94 be the two column vectors of the jacobian matrix @xmath95 which spans the space tangent to the element at the point @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath96 then @xmath92 is given by @xmath97}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] if we let @xmath98 and @xmath99 , then @xmath100 and @xmath101    it can be seen from that , if @xmath102 , there exist two points @xmath103 $ ] such that @xmath104 .",

    "both of these two cases indicate a distorted shape of the element .    to illustrate the influence of the element aspect ratio on the behavior of function @xmath109 which represents the smoothness of @xmath75 , consider the curved element in figure [ fig : ex1 ] ; see section [ example1 ] for more detailed descriptions .",
    "the aspect ratio of the element is controlled by @xmath110 ; larger @xmath110 implies more distorted shape .",
    "let @xmath111 be the singular point .",
    "the plots of @xmath109 in the interval corresponding to the sub - triangle ( 2-b-3 ) in figure [ fig : ex1 ] with various @xmath110 are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath109 varies more acutely as the increase of the aspect ratio .",
    "the above analysis shows how element shape affects @xmath75 and thus the integrand in . in an intuitionistic manner ,",
    "the near singularity in @xmath75 is induced by the fact that the integration plane @xmath55 in intrinsic coordinate system is independent on the shape of element , as a result the distortion is brought into the integrand .",
    "one can suppose that if the integration is performed over another planar triangle which reflects the distortion of the element , the near singularity should be eliminated .",
    "this is the main idea of the our new method in section [ change ] .",
    "in addition to the near singularity in @xmath75 , another obstacle retards the convergence of the numerical quadrature for is the near singularity in @xmath64 , which can be clearly seen from .",
    "when the field point @xmath11 lies near to the boundary of the element , the restrict of @xmath71 approaches @xmath113 , thus the denominator @xmath114 is close to @xmath106 at the two ends of the interval @xmath65 ( see fig.[fig : polar ] ) .",
    "the effect of the near singularity in @xmath64 on the total behavior of the integrand @xmath115 is demonstrated by the left plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] ( a ) and ( b ) , where the integrand have large peaks near the two ends of the interval .",
    "unfortunately , the situation that causes the near singularity in @xmath64 is ubiquitous in using high order nystrm method .",
    "[ fig : cur_ref ] for a typical distribution of field points in @xmath0th order nystrm method .",
    "how to effectively resolve the above mentioned two difficulties is crucial to the accurate evaluation of the bem singular integrals .",
    "more recently , special quadratures are constructed for this purpose in @xcite .",
    "although accurate and robust numerical results are reported , it is noticed that the abscissas and weights of the special quadratures are depend on the singular ( field ) point as well as the element on which the integral is defined",
    ". the construction of the quadrature for integral can be rather complicated and time - consuming .    in this section",
    ", however , we propose a more simple yet efficient method .",
    "first , the intrinsic coordinates @xmath116 is transformed onto a new system which results in constant @xmath92 .",
    "an additional benefit of constant @xmath92 is that the line integral @xmath83 can be evaluated in closed form ; see section [ analytic ] .",
    "then the sigmoidal transformation is introduced to alleviate the near singularity caused by @xmath64 .",
    "first , the near singularity caused by @xmath92 in @xmath75 is considered and resolved .",
    "the idea is to introduce a new transformation under which @xmath92 becomes constant .",
    "it can be seen from that if @xmath117 then @xmath92 will be constant , i.e. @xmath118 .    relations indicate a conformal mapping from the element to the plane at field point @xmath11 , i.e. , both angle and the shape of the infinitesimal neighborhood at @xmath11 are preserved . however , this condition generally can not be satisfied under intrinsic coordinates . in @xcite hayami proposed to connect the three corners of the curved element to establish a planar triangle which preserves the shape of the element .",
    "this operation , nevertheless , can not satisfy condition exactly .    here",
    ", we propose a transformation in which the curved physical element is mapped to a triangle @xmath119 in plane @xmath120 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] .",

    "can be transformed onto @xmath126 plane .",
    "one can then employ the polar coordinate transform in section [ s : polar_coord ] .",

    "numerical results show that the above transformation can always improve the numerical integration regardless the shapes of the elements being regular or irregular .",
    "when the field point @xmath11 approaches the element boundary , function @xmath64 and thus the integral @xmath82 becomes nearly singular . here a sigmoidal transformation is introduced to alleviate this problem .",
    "the sigmoidal transformation was first proposed to calculate the singular and nearly singular integrals in two dimensional bem @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach was adopted as an angular transformation in dealing with nearly singular integrals in 3d bem @xcite .",
    "one should notice that the angular transformation proposed by khayat and wilton @xcite can be alternatively used , but our numerical experience indicates a better overall performance by using sigmoidal transformation , especially in hypersingular case .",
    "a sigmoidal transformation can be thought of as a mapping of the interval @xmath141 $ ] onto itself whose graph is _ s_-shaped .",

    "in addition there are cases where both @xmath145 and @xmath146 are not very close to right angles and thus the near singularity is not severe .",
    "for these cases , one can use the gauss quadratures directly without any transformation .",

    "<S> the polar coordinate transformation ( pct ) method has been extensively used to treat various singular integrals in the boundary element method ( bem ) . however , the resultant integrands of the pct tend to become nearly singular when ( 1 ) the aspect ratio of the element is large or ( 2 ) the field point is closed to the element boundary ; thus a large number of quadrature points are needed to achieve a relatively high accuracy . in this paper , the first problem is circumvented by using a conformal transformation so that the geometry of the curved physical element is preserved in the transformed domain . </S>",
