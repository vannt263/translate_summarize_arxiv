    "hadronic collisions may be factorized into perturbative components ( hard scattering and initial and final state radiation ) and non - perturbative components ( beam remnants and multiple parton interactions ) .",
    "these components are illustrated in the simple `` cartoon '' shown in figure  [ fig : hard_scat ] .",
    "this simple picture is similar to the model used by a program like pythia  @xcite to generate hadronic collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : hard_scat ] should be thought of as occurring within the radius of the proton around the colliding partons .",
    "in fact , the picture becomes more complicated when the property of qcd color confinement and detector effects are included .",
    "the colored partons must hadronize into color neutral hadrons .",
    "all of these particles originating from the different components of the collider event are indistinguishable in the detector , and it is the job of jet algorithms to cluster these objects into jets .",
    "figure  [ fig : levels ] illustrates that jets may be clustered at the parton ( quarks and gluons ) or particle ( hadrons ) level when dealing with mc simulation , or detector ( calorimeter towers ) levels .",
    "of course , measurements are made at the detector level , but it is useful to use the the parton and particle level jets from mc studies to derive corrections for the measured quantities .    _",
    ", width=245 ]    most results discussed in this note will focus on the properties of the perturbative component of the collision .",
    "however , studies of the `` underlying event ''  @xcite from cdf focus on measuring observables that are sensitive to the non - perturbative components such as beam remnants and multiple parton interactions .",
    "these studies provide constraints useful for the modeling of the non - perturbative regime ( where pqcd fails ) , such as the `` soft '' interactions generating the underlying event which accompanies the `` hard '' collision .",
    "the direction of the leading calorimeter jet is used to isolate regions of @xmath2-@xmath3space that are sensitive to the underlying event .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ue1 ] , the direction of the leading jet , jet#@xmath4 , is used to define correlations in the azimuthal angle , @xmath5 .",

    "these regions can be studied for different event topologies such as leading jet ( require one or more jets ) , back - to - back ( requiring two or more jets with the leading jets back - to - back in @xmath3 ) , and exclusive dijet ( requiring only two jets which are back - to - back in @xmath3 ) . by studying different regions and event topologies components of the hadronic collision",
