    "this result is not very sensitive to the choice of inititial pebble size : a growing pebble starting with 0.01  cm radius has a drift time of @xmath54  yr and a very similar final size .",
    "note , if @xmath55 is much smaller than our fiducial value , e.g. , due to interception of pebbles by a population of outer disk planetesimals ( guillot et al .",

    "these drift times thus set lower limits for the timescale of first , innermost planet formation in the iopf model .",

    "variation in dead zone properties , e.g. , from different disk midplane ionization rates by cosmic rays or radionuclide decay , could thus lead to a variety of planetary system formation mechanisms , perhaps helping to explain stip vs. solar system formation ."
