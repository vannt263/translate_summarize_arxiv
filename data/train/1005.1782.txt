    "pairing and nucleon - nucleon correlations are important properties of interacting nuclear systems .",
    "for example , in the weak - coupling limit , i.e. , at high density , the nucleons form cooper pairs , and below a certain critical temperature @xmath1 the system is in a superfluid phase as described by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory . in the strong - coupling limit ,",
    "i.e. , at low density , neutrons and protons form deuteron bound states which will condense if the temperature is below the critical temperature for the corresponding bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "it was theoretically predicted @xcite and recently confirmed by experiments with ultracold atomic fermi gases @xcite that there is a smooth crossover between the bcs and bec limits .",
    "qualitatively , especially at zero temperature , these features can be studied within the bcs ( mean field ) approximation @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , however , the critical temperature obtained in this way is too high because the bcs theory does not include the existence of non - condensed pairs at finite temperature . in order to go beyond mean field ,",
    "one has to consider pair correlations already above the critical temperature , as in the nozires - schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory @xcite . especially in the low density region , where the coupling between nucleons is strong , such correlations modify the mean - field results to a large extent .    at present",
    ", there are several groups who have studied nuclear matter within the nsr approach .",
    "pioneering work has been done by the rostock group @xcite .",
    "there are also extensions where the correlations are considered in a more self - consistent way , like in the self - consistent green s function method @xcite .",
    "a generalization to temperatures below the superfluid transition temperature was discussed by boek @xcite . in the case of ultracold fermi gases , where the results can be compared with very precise measurements , theories for the bec - bcs crossover based on the nsr approach @xcite have been very successful @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there exists a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter .",
    "experimental information can be obtained from multifragmentation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the critical temperature deduced from these experiments depends on the mass of the nuclei and can be as low as 6.7 mev @xcite in the case of small systems . for infinite nuclear matter ,",
    "theoretical predictions give much higher values for the critical temperature between 14 and 18 mev @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent theoretical study ) .",
    "below that temperature , nuclear matter is unstable in a certain range of low densities . within mean - field theory , we know that the bcs - bec crossover is completely covered by the instability region of the liquid - gas phase transition . nevertheless , the investigation of low - density nuclear matter is of interest for applications where regions of low density appear in the framework of the local - density approximation .",
    "contrary to the nuclear matter case , the whole crossover can be studied in the case of ultracold atomic fermi gases @xcite , because the pair correlations stabilize the gas @xcite such that the system does not collapse into its solid ground state but it remains in its metastable gas state . by analogy ,",
    "one expects that pair correlations will stabilize low - density nuclear matter and thus reduce the liquid - gas coexistence region .",
    "one of our subjects of investigation will be how strong this effect of nucleon - nucleon correlations on the liquid gas phase transition is quantitatively .",
    "furthermore , in this paper we will calculate the equation of state of hot and dense symmetric nuclear matter , taking into account the contribution of the mean field together with the nucleon - nucleon correlations . for the mean field we will use the gogny interaction because it is known to give a good description of the single - particle and thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter , including saturation at the right density , the liquid - gas phase transition , etc . for the part beyond the mean field , we use the @xmath0-matrix ( or ladder approximation ) which contains the information on two - particle correlations .",
    "this also allows us to extract the critical temperature for pair condensation smoothly interpolating between the bec and bcs regimes .",

    "before explicitly including two - particle correlations , we calculate the single - particle green s function within the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation . in order to get a reasonable description of the single - particle energies",
    ", we use the density - dependent d1 gogny effective interaction to describe the mean field .",

    "it has the form @xmath2 where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , the spin and isospin exchange operators .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling term is neglected here , since we consider only the properties of infinite nuclear matter . for the parameters we use the values given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in d1 and d1s is almost the same , the results do not change qualitatively if we use d1s instead of d1 .",
    "] for details of the hf description of nuclear matter at finite temperature with the gogny force , see refs .",
    "the hf mean field @xmath5 contains the direct , the exchange , and the rearrangement contributions . because of the finite range of the gogny force",
    ", the exchange contribution is momentum dependent , and the single - particle green s function takes the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the quasiparticle energy defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the chemical potential . in order to facilitate the numerical calculation of the correlation effects",
    ", we use the effective - mass approximation for the gogny mean field , i.e. , we write @xcite @xmath10 there are different ways to define the effective nucleon mass @xmath11 . in principle , @xmath11 is momentum dependent @xcite . here",
    "we use the effective mass defined by expanding eq .",
    "( [ xihf ] ) around @xmath12 ( we checked that for the final results it makes almost no difference if we expand around zero or around the fermi momentum ) , i.e. , @xmath13 however , the effective - mass approximation will only be used for the calculation of the correlation effects , while the mean - field contributions will be computed with the full momentum dependence of @xmath14 .    in principle",
    ", we are looking for the full single - particle green s function @xmath15 including correlations .",
    "the dyson equation can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the correlation contribution to the single - particle self - energy . since the gogny force is a density - dependent effective interaction , which is designed to give good results already at the hf level",
    ", we suppose that the gogny mean field accounts already for most of the correlation effects .",
    "we therefore demand that the correlations do not shift the quasiparticle energies @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath18 , and that the role of the correlations is just to reduce the strength of the quasiparticle pole and to distribute the remaining strength in the continuum of the spectral function .",
    "hence , we define @xmath17 to be the self - energy subtracted at @xmath7 : @xmath19 in order to describe pair correlations , we calculate the self - energy @xmath20 within the @xmath0-matrix or ladder approximation , as shown in the lower part of fig . [",

    "since our aim is not a completely self - consistent description of the spectral function as in the self - consistent green s function method @xcite , we make the assumption that the correlations can be treated as a small correction to the gogny hf self - energy .",
    "this allows us to use the hf green s function @xmath21 in the calculation of the @xmath0 matrix and of the self - energy @xmath20 .",
    "then , for consistency , one should also keep only the first - order term of eq .",
    "( [ dysoneq ] ) , i.e. , @xmath22 a diagrammatic representation is given in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ]    that the self - energy in t - matrix approximation should only be treated in first - order perturbation theory may also have a more formal reason .",
    "the t - matrix approximation corresponds to particle - particle random - phase approximation ( pp - rpa ) @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the ground - state energy calculated from the single - particle green s function with self - energy in first order and in t - matrix approximation yields exactly the pp - rpa ground - state energy @xcite .",
    "at least this holds true for the self - energy without subtraction procedure .",
    "therefore our formalism is closely related to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the pp - rpa formalism is used , except that we apply the subtraction prescription while the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite are obliged to reduce the correlation contribution by introducing a cutoff and to change the parameters of the gogny force in order maintain the right saturation point of nuclear matter .",
    "note that our approximations are analogous to nsr theory @xcite , except that in nsr theory free green s functions instead of hf ones are used and consequently no subtraction is made in the self - energy . in the case of nuclear matter , however , we can not expect to obtain a good description of the full self - energy from such a simple model for the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "this is why we use the gogny mean field and the subtraction method described above , while the subtracted self - energy serves only to provide the energy dependence corresponding to the pair correlations in the channels we want to study .    in order to get a simple expression for the @xmath0 matrix",

    "here we do not separate the correlation contribution into bound and scattering state contributions , since individually they are not very meaningful , as discussed in ref .",
    "for instance , if the temperature is much higher than the deuteron binding energy , the first term of the scattering - state contribution ( [ nscatt ] ) cancels almost exactly the bound - state contribution ( [ nbound ] ) .    in the above calculation ,",
    "when the temperature is below some critical value , we get a divergence in the @xmath0 matrix .",

    "as mentioned above , @xmath1 as a function of @xmath9 coincides with the bcs result . as a function of the density , the difference between the results @xmath112 with and without correlations comes only from the different relations for @xmath113 as a function of @xmath9 . since the correlation contribution to the density vanishes in the high density region , the phase boundary coincides with the bcs curve ( long dashed line , which is obtained with @xmath114 only ) . at very low density and temperature ,",

    "this confirms our expectation mentioned in the introduction that the correlations have a stabilizing effect .",
    "however , the bec - bcs crossover lies still in the unstable region of the liquid - gas phase transition",
    ".      the energy and the entropy can be obtained from the pressure with the help of the thermodynamic relations ( [ thermodynamics ] ) .",
    "results for the energy per nucleon , @xmath134 , and for the entropy per nucleon , @xmath135 , for different temperatures are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : energy ] and [ fig : entropy ] .",
    ", width=283 ]    the corresponding mean - field results ( dashed lines ) are also shown for comparison .",
    "the results shown in fig . [ fig : energy ] indicate that , for fixed temperature , the correlations shift the minimum of the energy per nucleon to slightly higher densities .",
    "fortunately the change is very small , because otherwise we would have to readjust the parameters of the gogny force , which gives the right saturation density and energy at zero temperature without correlations .    in the low - density region , where the deuterons and the nucleon - nucleon scattering states dominate , the energy per nucleon is lower than that the hf result .",
    "when the density is high , the correlation effect goes to zero and the energy per nucleon gets close to the mean - field result .",
    "when the density approaches zero , both results go to the classical value of an ideal gas of nucleons , @xmath136 this is not surprising , since even the lowest temperature considered here , @xmath100 mev , is still much higher than the deuteron binding energy so that almost all deuterons will be dissociated .",
    "however , the result ( [ elimit ] ) is also found at temperatures much lower than the deuteron binding energy .",
    "this is because , at finite temperature , the deuterons are always dissolved in the low - density limit .",
    "this is a consequence of the mass - action law and can easily be understood as follows : at low density , the chemical potential of the nucleons , @xmath9 , gets strongly negative , @xmath137 .",
    "the chemical potential of the deuterons is @xmath138 , which is even more negative .",
    "so the nucleon density @xmath139 is much larger than the deuteron density @xmath140 . only at zero temperature , where the system remains a deuteron bec at arbitrarily low densities , the energy per nucleon approaches @xmath141 mev ( half the deuteron binding energy ) in the limit @xmath142 @xcite .    ,",
    "width=283 ]    the results for the entropy ( cf .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] ) have been calculated from eq .",
    "( [ thermodynamics ] ) and show that , for fixed temperature , the entropy per nucleon decreases with increasing density .",
    "in the zero - density limit , the entropy per nucleon increases logarithmically , in agreement with the result for a classical ideal nucleon gas .",
    "as is clear from the discussion above , the correlations do not change this asymptotic behavior . at slightly larger values of the density ,",
    "the correlations tend to increase the entropy .",
    "in this paper , we discussed the effect of pair correlations beyond the mean - field approximation in symmetric nuclear matter above the superfluid critical temperature .",
    "we include the effects of non - condensed pairs ( deuterons ) as well as the contribution of scattering states .",
    "for the mean field , we use the gogny effective interaction in order to get the right saturation properties of nuclear matter .    starting from the single - particle green s function within the gogny hf approximation , we include the correlations in a perturbative way by considering in addition to the hf green s function the diagram with one self - energy insertion , the self - energy being calculated in ladder approximation . this approximation scheme is analogous to the well - known nsr approach .",
    "however , in order to avoid double counting of the quasiparticle energy shift which is already accounted for by the gogny mean field , we have to subtract the self - energy at the quasiparticle energy .",
    "this leads finally to the same formula for the density in terms of the in - medium scattering phase shifts as given in ref .",
    "we use a separable yamaguchi potential in order to get an analytical formula for the in - medium @xmath0 matrix and the phase shifts .",
    "evaluating numerically these formulas for the density , we discussed the different density contributions in hot and dense nuclear matter and found that the nucleon - nucleon correlations are important in the low - temperature and low - density region ( @xmath143 ) . the correlation effect on the superfluid critical temperature was discussed .",
    "the result interpolates between the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation at low density and the bcs critical temperature at high density .",
    "we found that the maximum of the superfluid critical temperature decreases from @xmath144 mev ( the value given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) to @xmath130 mev when the effective mass @xmath11 due to the gogny mean field is taken into account .",
    "then we studied the liquid - gas phase transition in hot and dense nuclear matter with the help of the pressure calculated from the density . especially at low density",
    ", we found that the boundaries of the coexistence and spinodal regions of the phase transition are shifted by the pair correlations .",
    "as we expected , the stable and metastable regions of the gas phase are strongly enlarged .",
    "in particular near the superfluid transition temperature , the gas phase stays metastable up to much higher densities if the correlations are taken into account .",
    "however , the correlations are not strong enough to suppress the liquid - gas transition .",
    "this could have been anticipated from the fact that the liquid - gas critical temperature is much higher than the superfluid one @xcite .",
    "because of our perturbative treatment of the correlations , the critical temperature of the liquid - gas transition remains the same as within the mean field approximation .    finally , we calculated the energy and entropy of nuclear matter from thermodynamic relations .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon correlations decrease the energy per nucleon in the low density region but increase it at high density . for the entropy",
    ", the correlations always give a positive contribution .",
    "as mentioned before , our result for the critical temperature of liquid - gas phase transition is not affected by the pair correlations because they are treated only perturbatively .",
    "one should improve this by taking the correlations into account self - consistently .",
    "then the correlations will have some effect on the hf field and the critical temperature will change .",
    "the saturation point of nuclear matter , given correctly by the gogny interaction within the hf approximation , may be changed , necessitating a readjustment of the parameters of the gogny force .",
    "our equation of state is only valid for temperatures and densities above the superfluid critical temperature . in order to get a result which is valid in the whole temperature and density plane",
    ", one should introduce the pairing gap @xmath105 into the single - particle green s functions .",
    "some work in this direction has been done for nuclear matter @xcite , and quite elaborate theories have been developed for the bec - bcs crossover in ultracold atomic fermi gases @xcite .",
    "we leave this for future study .",
    "another important extension of the present work would be to consider the case of asymmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter , since these are of great importance for the study of neutron stars and their formation .",
    "in this appendix we give a more transparent derivation of the density formulas ( [ ncontrib ] ) , ( [ nbound ] ) , and ( [ nscatt ] ) , which were initially derived in refs .",
