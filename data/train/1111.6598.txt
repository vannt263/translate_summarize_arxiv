    "with fiber - fed spectrographs , galaxy surveys , such as the las campanas redshift survey @xcite , the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , and the galaxy and mass assembly survey(gama ) @xcite can efficiently cover a large sky area and obtain redshifts for a large set of targeted galaxies simultaneously .",
    "a well - known problem of using fibers is that the finite size of the fiber plugs prevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another on the same plate .",
    "consequently a significant fraction of targeted galaxies from a photometric catalog can not be assigned fibers and obtain measured spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "this problem is partly alleviated by having some regions on the sky covered by overlapping plates , but it still results in a fraction of targeted galaxies left with no measured spectroscopic redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath2 in the sdss ) .",
    "these fiber - collided galaxies are a hindrance to any galaxy clustering study . in this paper",
    ", we propose and test a new method to account for fiber collision effects and to accurately measure galaxy clustering statistics on small and intermediate scales .",
    "the angular fiber - collision scale , under which two fibers on the same plate collide with each other , is determined by the fiber placement hardware and differs from survey to survey . for sdss - i and ii",
    ", this scale is @xmath3 , corresponding to about @xmath4 at the median redshift @xmath5 . for sdss - iii ,",
    "the angular fiber - collision scale is slightly larger , @xmath6 , corresponding to about @xmath7 ( comoving ) at the larger median redshift @xmath8 of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) .",
    "if fiber collisions are not corrected for , galaxy clustering on scales below the collision scale would not be accurately measured .",
    "for example , in the case of galaxy two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) , the effect is seen as a significant decline in the clustering signal below the collision scale @xcite . at a fixed angular collision scale , the comoving scale increases with redshift , making the fiber collision a more severe problem in studying small - scale clustering for surveys at higher redshifts .",
    "furthermore , fiber collisions have a non - negligible effect on galaxy clustering measurements even on scales larger than the collision scale @xcite .",
    "therefore , to study galaxy clustering on small scales and to have precise measurements on larger scales , the effect induced by fiber collision has to be corrected for .    in general , there are two approaches to correct the fiber collision effect in measuring galaxy 2pcfs .",
    "one is to recover the redshifts of the fiber - collided galaxies and the other is to reconstruct the correct galaxy pair counts . for the former one ,",
    "a commonly adopted method is to assign each collided galaxy the redshift of its nearest angular neighbor ( nearest - neighbor correction ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the method has been applied to measure the projected 2pcf @xmath9 at a transverse separation @xmath10 for the sdss - i and ii main galaxy sample @xcite , which proves to work well down to the fiber collision scale @xmath11 .",
    "however , the method fails below the collision scale and does not give a satisfactory correction for the redshift - space correlation function .",
    "for surveys at higher redshifts , the increase in the ( comoving ) fiber collision scale limits the application of the nearest neighbor correction to clustering at larger scales .    for the approach of reconstructing the pair counts",
    ", a common method is to make use of the angular 2pcf of the spectroscopic sample , @xmath12 , and that of the parent photometric sample , @xmath13 , at angular separation @xmath14 , with the same angular and redshift selection applied to both samples @xcite .",
    "the projected galaxy pair count in computing @xmath9 is weighted by the ratio @xmath15/[1+w_{sz}(\\theta)]$ ] , where @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath10 at the median redshift of the survey .",
    "such a weighting scheme incorporates the angular information of the missing galaxies and retrieves the correct angular counts .",
    "however , @xmath9 and @xmath16 are not completely correspondent .",
    "@xcite test this method with mock catalogs of sdss galaxies .",
    "the method works reasonably well on large scales , but on scales of @xmath17  @xmath18 the corrected @xmath9 shows a clear deficit with respect to the true @xmath9 .",
    "other methods aimed at overcoming the fiber collision problem to measure the small - scale galaxy clustering broadly fall into the above two categories or some combination . for example , the small - scale clustering can be inferred from the full photometric sample by cross - correlating with the spectroscopic sample @xcite . under the assumption of isotropic clustering ,",
    "the photometric objects near a spectroscopic target can be considered to be at the same redshift as the target , similar to the nearest neighbor method , and the small - scale clustering can be measured .",
    "contamination from interlopers reduces the signal - to - noise and needs to be removed statistically . as with the nearest neighbor method",
    ", this cross - correlation technique does not work in measuring the full three - dimensional ( 3d ) clustering in redshift space .",
    "accurate measurements of galaxy clustering are important in many applications .",
    "in particular , the small - scale clustering can be used to probe the spatial distribution of galaxies inside the host dark matter halos ( e.g , @xcite ) , to infer the kinematics of galaxies in halos , and to reveal environmental effects on galaxy formation and evolution . in this paper",
    "we propose a new and efficient correction method for the fiber collision effect based on the spectroscopic galaxy sample .",
    "the method is proven to work well in the case of measuring both the projected galaxy 2pcfs and the full 3d redshift - space 2pcfs . after describing the mock catalogs used for testing the method and our measurements in section 2",
    ", we present our correction method and explain its theoretical basis in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "tests of the method with mock catalogs and comparisons with other methods are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss possible systematic effects of the method in section  [ sec : sys ] and conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "throughout the paper , our proposed new method will be tested and compared to other methods using clustering measurements performed on available realistic mock catalogs .",
    "we use the lasdamas galaxy mock catalogs ( c.  mcbride et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) , which are constructed by populating galaxies into dark matter halos identified in the lasdamas simulations .",
    "the @xmath19-body lasdamas simulations adopt a spatially flat @xmath20cdm cosmology , with a matter density parameter @xmath21 , baryon density of @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( the primordial matter fluctuation amplitude on scales of 8@xmath24 , linearly extrapolated to @xmath25 ) , a primordial matter fluctuation spectra index @xmath26 , and a hubble constant of @xmath27 .",
    "dark matter halos are identified using a friends - of - friends algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ) with a linking length of @xmath28 times the mean particle separation .",
    "dark matter halos are populated with galaxies through a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) approach ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the hod parameters are determined through modeling the clustering of the early boss @xmath29 cmass sample @xcite .",
    "redshift space distortions are also included in the mock catalogs by accounting for the peculiar velocities of galaxies .",
    "the radial and angular selection functions in the mock catalogs are constructed to be uniform .    in total , we make use of 40 lasdamas mock galaxy catalogs . in addition to matching the clustering of cmass galaxies",
    ", the mocks also reproduce the geometry of the early boss data . as in @xcite ,",
    "the lasdamas mock catalogs for cmass sample are divided into three separate regions . for simplicity",
    ", we only use the so - called  region b \" in @xcite , since it has the largest volume and number of galaxies .",
    "each mock of this region consists of about @xmath30 galaxies , with a sky coverage of @xmath31 and a redshift range of @xmath32 , corresponding to a volume of @xmath33 .",
    "the mock catalogs do not have the specific tiling mask and fiber collisions imposed on them , and we do that ourselves for our tests as described below .",
    "in this paper , we focus our discussion on the 2pcfs and related statistics .",
    "we use the landy - szalay estimator @xcite to measure the 2pcfs of galaxies in the mock catalogs , @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the data - data , data - random , and random - random pair counts measured from the data of @xmath19 galaxies and random samples consisting of @xmath38 random points .",
    "these pair counts are normalized by dividing by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we measure the 3d @xmath42 and @xmath43 functions and the redshift - space 2pcf @xmath44 , where @xmath10 and @xmath45 are the separations of galaxy pairs perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight @xcite , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the redshift - space 2pcf differs from the real - space one because of the redshift distortion effect induced by galaxy peculiar velocity .",
    "the redshift distortion can be mitigated by projecting the 2pcf along the line - of - sight direction , with the projected 2pcf @xmath9 @xcite defined and measured as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the @xmath53th bin of the line - of - sight separation and its corresponding bin size .",
    "following @xcite , the redshift - space 2pcf @xmath43 can be written in the form of multipole expansion , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56-th order legendre polynomial .",
    "the multipole moments @xmath57 is determined by @xmath58 in linear theory , only the moments of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are non - zero .",
    "the monopole @xmath62 , quadrupole @xmath63 , and hexadecapole @xmath64 are useful for the study of redshift distortions and for obtaining constraints on cosmological parameters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will also test how well our method recovers these moments .",
    "for measuring the 2pcfs , we use a binning scheme of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "our results are insensitive to these choices . to obtain the projected 2pcf @xmath9 , @xmath42",
    "is summed along the line - of - sight direction up to @xmath69 . integrating to a larger line - of - sight separation or using realistic angular and redshift selection functions",
    "will not affect the conclusion on our correction method .",
    "we also note that while the mock catalogs we use were constructed for studying the boss cmass sample , our general conclusions regarding the validity of our method are not dependent on that and would hold for other mock and real data sets .",
    "in modern galaxy redshift surveys , a tiling algorithm is usually applied to design and place spectroscopic plates ( tiles ) to cover the survey area .",
    "these tiles partially overlap over some of the observed region . in such overlap regions ,",
    "a galaxy with no fiber assigned in one tile can have a fiber allocated in the other one .",
    "for example , in sdss - i and ii , about @xmath70 of the survey area is covered by more than one tile , which eliminates most of the fiber collisions in those regions .",
    "the basic idea of our method of dealing with the fiber collision effect is simply to estimate the contribution of the fiber - collided galaxies to the clustering by using the information in the tile overlap regions . in order to make such an estimate , before measuring any clustering statistic",
    ", we divide the full galaxy target sample ( i.e. , the input photometric sample ) into two distinct populations :    _ population 1 _ : a subsample in which each galaxy is not angularly collided with any other galaxy in this subsample .",
    "we maximize the number of galaxies that are not collided with each other .",
    "such a set of `` decollided '' galaxies provide a `` clean '' subsample with no fiber collision correction to be considered .",
    "_ population 2 _ : a subsample including all the galaxies that are not in population 1 .",
    "this is the set of potentially collided galaxies , and all the fiber - collided galaxies come from this subsample .",
    "each galaxy in this population is within the fiber collision scale of a galaxy in population 1 .",
    "the division of population @xmath71 and @xmath60 follows the scheme of assigning fibers in sdss observations @xcite .",
    "the specific tiling algorithm always recovers one galaxy from collided pairs , and two galaxies from the collided triples if the angular distance of these two galaxies are larger than the fiber collision scale . with our division ,",
    "population 1 galaxies always have fibers allocated and have spectroscopic redshifts measured . some fraction of population 2",
    "galaxies can also have fibers allocated in the tile overlap regions . also with our division , in each `` collided '' close pair of galaxies , one galaxy ( with measured redshift ) will always be part of population @xmath71 and the other ( with a measured redshift or not ) will be part of population @xmath60 .",
    "this definition aims to ensure that the pair counts involving the galaxies with redshifts in population @xmath60 ( hereafter , we refer to them as `` resolved '' galaxies ) can be regarded as a representative subset of the overall pair counts .",
    "the specific tiling and fiber assignment constraints can make the situation non - trivial if the `` representative '' assumption is not satisfied in real observation , and we discuss the possible systematics introduced in such a case in section [ sec : sys ] .",
    "we assume that in the survey , we have @xmath72 galaxy targets , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the numbers of galaxies in populations @xmath71 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "again , all galaxies in population 1 have spectroscopic redshifts , and because of fiber collisions only a fraction of population 2 galaxies do ( e.g. , in tile overlap regions ) .",
    "we denote the set of targeted galaxies as @xmath75 ( with a total number @xmath19 ) and use @xmath76 and @xmath77 to represent the sets of population 1 and 2 galaxies in the sample ( with numbers of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively ) .",
    "we use @xmath78 and @xmath79 to denote the corresponding galaxy sets that have spectroscopic redshifts measured ( with numbers @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "note that by definition , @xmath82 is the same as @xmath76 .",
    "the data - data pairs counts can then be decomposed as @xmath83 and @xmath84 the actual numbers of pairs in equation  ( [ eqn : pair_decomp_a ] ) are what are needed to estimate galaxy 2pcfs , while the pair numbers in equation  ( [ eqn : pair_decomp_b ] ) are what one obtains in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "our method is to make use of the pair counts of population 1 and 2 galaxies and those of population 2 galaxies in the tile overlap regions to recover the correct counts appearing in equation  ( [ eqn : pair_decomp_a ] ) , and therefore to measure the 2pcfs properly .",
    "we note that the fraction of @xmath85 in @xmath77 galaxies , @xmath86 , is an important factor in the following discussions . as with the data - data pair counts",
    ", the data - random pair counts @xmath36 can also be decomposed in a similar way .      to illustrate our fiber - collision correction method",
    ", we first consider the simplest case where population 2 galaxies are randomly selected to be assigned fibers . in this case",
    ", @xmath85 is a random subset of @xmath77 , and the pair counts @xmath87 and @xmath88 are simply proportional to the full counts @xmath89 and @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 for simplicity , @xmath74 and @xmath92 are assumed to be large so that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are replaced with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the above equations provide the way to correct the pair counts obtained from the spectroscopic sample .",
    "similarly , the data - random pair counts can be corrected as @xmath97 since we can have a large number of random points , the correction here for @xmath98 is less noisy than those for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the full pair counts are reconstructed as @xmath99    figure  [ fig : ratio ] shows the data - data pair counts from the mock catalogs for the simplified case , decomposed according to equation  ( [ eqn : dd ] ) .",
    "the fiber collisions are artificially imposed on the mocks with an overall fraction of @xmath100 as in the boss cmass catalogs .",
    "the solid and dotted curves are the corrected pair counts , obtained from the spectroscopic samples , averaged over the 40 mocks , while the squares show the actual full pair counts .",
    "the shaded region in each panel denotes the @xmath101 scatter from the 40 mock catalogs of the @xmath35 pair count ( estimated from @xmath102 based on eq .",
    "[ eqn : corrected_pair ] ) . comparing the solid curve ( plus the small shaded region ) with the squares",
    ", we see that our correction method accurately recovers the true pair counts over all scales probed , for both @xmath44 and @xmath42 .",
    "the increase in the scatter on small scales is caused by shot noise , since the numbers of @xmath103 and @xmath104 pairs are less than @xmath105 and @xmath106 pairs .    from figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , we see that there are almost no @xmath107 pairs with separation smaller than @xmath108 , which is the minimum fiber collision scale ( corresponding to the lowest redshift @xmath109 ) . on small scales ,",
    "the pair count is dominated by @xmath105 pairs , while @xmath106 pairs have a small but non - negligible contribution . across the fiber collision scale ( @xmath110@xmath111 ) , the dominant contribution to the total pair count shifts from @xmath105 pairs to @xmath107 pairs , reflecting the change from collided to decollided galaxies .",
    "our correction method can be put in terms of a decomposition of the 2pcf . with a galaxy sample divided into subsamples , such as red and blue galaxies , central and satellite galaxies , or in our case population 1 and 2 galaxies",
    ", the 2pcf can be decomposed into contributions from the two - point auto- and cross - correlation functions of subsample galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is a fully equivalent way of describing the pair decomposition . in the case of dividing the galaxy sample into population 1 and 2 subsamples",
    ", we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 can be either @xmath44 , @xmath42 , or @xmath9 , and @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 are the two - point auto - correlation function of population 1 galaxies , cross - correlation function between population 1 and population 2 galaxies , and auto - correlation function of population 2 galaxies , respectively .",
    "the second line in the equation uses the component correlation functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 estimated from the @xmath76 and @xmath85 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample to approximate @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which is the key point of our correction method .",
    "if @xmath85 galaxies are representative of @xmath77 galaxies , i.e. , @xmath85 is a random subset of @xmath77 , the ensemble average of @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) should equal to that of @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , _ 12=_12,_22=_22 .",
    "that is , with ensemble averages , the approximate symbol can be replaced with the equal sign .",
    "therefore , our method using equation  ( [ eqn : xid ] ) provides an unbiased correction , which is a desired merit . in practice ,",
    "the method is only applied to one realization in the ensemble , so differences are expected between the true underlying 2pcf and the 2pcf corrected with our method . however",
    ", any discrepancies would only result from the fact that a smaller number of galaxies are used to estimate the component 2pcfs .",
    "they show up as sample variance , not systematic errors .",
    "potential systematics caused by the violation of the `` representative '' assumption of @xmath85 galaxies are discussed in section [ sec : sys ] .",
    "the component 2pcfs can be estimated with the landy - szalay estimator , _",
    "11&=&d_1d_1 - 2d_1r_1+r_1r_1r_1r_1,[eqn : xi11 ] + _ 12&=&d_1d_2-d_1r_2-d_2r_1+r_1r_2r_1r_2,[eqn : xi12 ] + _",
    "22&=&d_2d_2-2d_2r_2+r_2r_2r_2r_2[eqn : xi22 ] . in the case",
    "that @xmath119 is a random subset of @xmath77 , we can use the same random sample , i.e. , @xmath120 in the above equations .",
    "it is not surprising that when substituting the above equations into equation  ( [ eqn : xid ] ) , we end up with exactly the same result as with equations  ( [ eqn : dd ] ) and ( [ eqn : dr ] ) .",
    "taking into account the tiling in the real observational situation would change the geometry of the distribution of @xmath85 galaxies such that most of them would preferentially populate the tile - overlap regions .",
    "the survey geometry can be described by the individual sectors , defined by areas of sky covered by unique sets of tiles @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath121 to denote the number of tiles covering each sector . for @xmath122 regions , essentially no fiber - collided galaxies ( @xmath77 ) can have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "for @xmath123 regions , however , most of these will be resolved , with spectroscopic redshifts measured as a result of repeated observations in these tile overlap regions . in practice ,",
    "some fiber - collided @xmath77 galaxies in @xmath122 regions may still have spectroscopic redshifts from other surveys . in the case of the cmass sample , about @xmath124 of all the galaxies",
    "do not have redshifts . specifically , the values of the ratio @xmath86 are about @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 in @xmath128 regions , respectively .",
    "the @xmath125 recovered galaxies in @xmath129 regions are included from the `` legacy survey '' of sdss - i and ii @xcite .    in order to mimic the full observational case",
    ", we impose the tile placement of the boss survey on all mock catalogs as well as fiber collisions according to the tiling algorithm with the appropriate @xmath86 ratios specified above .",
    "we stress that the validity of our method does not depend on the specific values of these parameters , and these are simply chosen here to resemble the values in the boss survey .",
    "figure  [ fig : radec ] illustrates the galaxy distribution and the tile placement in a small section of one of our mocks .",
    "the open symbols are all @xmath76 galaxies . filled squares denote @xmath77 galaxies , where blue ones mark resolved galaxies ( @xmath85 ) and red ones are those galaxies in @xmath77 whose redshifts are missing due to fiber collisions .",
    "the @xmath85 galaxies are not randomly distributed over the whole observed sky  they mostly occupy regions with @xmath123 .    for the tiled case , our correction method as in section  [ theory ] remains the same , and the only modification is the need to account for the specific geometry of the @xmath85 galaxy distribution .",
    "one straightforward way to do this is to create separate random catalogs @xmath130 and @xmath131 for @xmath76 and @xmath85 galaxies .",
    "the @xmath130 catalog can be created as usual by incorporating the standard radial and angular selection functions of the sample .",
    "we note that the latter is commonly characterized and applied as a function of the individual sectors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the @xmath131 catalog , an additional angular completeness mask needs to be applied , with the number of random points in each individual sector modified by the corresponding @xmath86 ratio .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : radec ] the circular tile centered at @xmath132 and @xmath133 is comprised of 8 individual sectors , as a result of tile overlap , each with its own @xmath86 value . in the extreme case",
    "that there are no @xmath85 galaxies in @xmath129 regions , these regions would be empty in the @xmath131 catalog .",
    "alternatively , one could choose to up - weight @xmath85 galaxies in each sector by @xmath134 , instead of creating a separate random sample for the @xmath85 galaxies .",
    "however , for @xmath122 regions , @xmath86 is usually a tiny number , which will introduce large errors when adopting the up - weighting method .",
    "therefore , we prefer to down - weight the random catalog to accurately account for the angular distribution and selection of @xmath85 galaxies .",
    "we test our correction method and compare with other commonly used methods by measuring the 2pcfs and related statistics in the lasdamas mocks .",
    "we first show results for the simplified case and then test our method on our tiled mocks .",
    "to apply our correction method , we first divide the mock galaxies into the two populations as discussed in   [ sub : division ] .",
    "we first define all galaxies in the sample as @xmath76 and proceed as below : ( 1 ) for each collided pair in @xmath76 , we randomly change one galaxy to be @xmath77 ; ( 2 ) for each collided triplet ( and higher multiplet ) in @xmath76 , we assign as @xmath77 the galaxy that collides with the most @xmath76 galaxies ; ( 3 ) we repeat steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) until none of the galaxies in @xmath76 collides with one another .",
    "this method maximizes the number of galaxies in @xmath76 and mimics the real tiling algorithm . in reality , some objects ( e.g. , quasars ) have higher fiber allocation priority and some assigned fibers do not result in reliable redshifts due to the hardware limitation .",
    "this complicates the tiling algorithm , but the targeted galaxies can still be divided into the two populations properly .",
    "the population division results in about 9.5% of all galaxies being in the @xmath77 sample .",
    "we then randomly assign fibers to 42% of the @xmath77 galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath100 ) , so that about 5.5% of _ all _ galaxies do not have fibers assigned , mimicking the fiber collision fraction in the cmass sample . with the simplest case considered here ,",
    "we only need to create one random catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig : wp ] shows the 2pcfs ( @xmath135 and @xmath44 ) from our correction method and the comparisons with those from other methods . filled",
    "squares represent the actual 2pcfs , measured using all the mock galaxies .",
    "error bars reflect the @xmath101 variation among the 40 lasdamas mocks .",
    "open squares are obtained using only those galaxies that have fibers assigned , corresponding to the case without any fiber - collision correction . in each panel ,",
    "the vertical dotted line is the fiber - collision scale corresponding to the highest redshifts included in the mocks .",
    "not accounting for fiber - collisions , the measured 2pcf drops sharply below the collision scale , and it is also underestimated on larger scales .",
    "note that the error bars in the top panels represent the variance ( fluctuation ) among the 40 mocks , and they do not reflect directly the accuracy of our correction method . in the bottom left panel ,",
    "we compute the ratio @xmath136 ( and similarly for @xmath44 in the bottom right panel ) for each mock , where @xmath135 and @xmath137 are the corrected 2pcf and the true one .",
    "the error bars are the @xmath101 variation of the ratio among the 40 mocks , which reflects the mean accuracy of our correction method for one mock .",
    "the mean ratio curve corresponds to a volume 40 times larger than one mock , showing clearly that our correction method is unbiased .    in each panel ,",
    "the blue solid curve is the 2pcf obtained with our correction method , averaged over the 40 mocks .",
    "error bars are the @xmath101 scatter among the 40 mocks .",
    "our correction method works very well for both @xmath135 and @xmath44 over all measured scales .",
    "in particular , it works down to the smallest scales for which we have enough pair counts to estimate the 2pcf ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the fractional errors for @xmath9 on small scales are smaller than those for @xmath44 , since for the same value and bin size of @xmath10 and @xmath139 there are more pairs in computing @xmath9 than @xmath44 due to the projection over large line - of - sight separation . on scales above @xmath18 , the errors in both @xmath135 and @xmath44 are similar , at the level of @xmath1403% .    the full collision - free 2pcfs and the ones corresponding to our new correction method are further decomposed , in the top panels , into the contributions from the component 2pcfs ( dashed and dotted lines ;",
    "( [ eqn : xid ] ) and ( [ eqn : xid ] ) ) .",
    "our correction recovers well all the components of the correlation function .",
    "similar to figure  [ fig : ratio ] , the contribution from @xmath114 dominates on large scales , and it quickly decreases below the fiber collision scale . the contribution from component @xmath115 dominates on scales smaller than the collision scale , where that of @xmath116 makes a non - negligible contribution . without any fiber collision correction , the measured 2pcfs ( open squares )",
    "are still a combination of the three component 2pcfs , but with different coefficients than those in equation  ( [ eqn : xid ] ) .",
    "the significant decline at the fiber collision scale in the non - corrected @xmath9 reflects the transition from @xmath114 to @xmath115 dominated regime .",

    ", the nearest - neighbor method ( red curves ) yields the correct @xmath9 above the fiber collision scale , due to the line - of - sight projection , but it clearly overestimates @xmath9 below this scale ( see also @xcite ) , because of the increasing importance of the line - of - sight separation on small scales . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor estimate fails to recover the correct values over most scales , deviating by more than @xmath101 for all scales @xmath141 .",
    "thus its use is very limited for redshift - space clustering measurements .",
    "the 2pcfs ( both @xmath135 and @xmath44 ) from the angular correction method systematically deviate from the true values except for small scales , and on large scales they approach the estimate with no fiber - collision correction applied ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the deviation is at a level @xmath142 , consistent with the finding of @xcite .",
    "physical explanations for the deviations seen in the nearest - neighbor and angular corrections are provided in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in contrast , our correction method appears unbiased , not showing any systematic errors .",
    "the measurement errors are larger than those with all galaxies ( top panels in figure  [ fig : wp ] ) .",
    "this is easy to understand  our method only uses galaxies with fibers assigned ( i.e. , with spectroscopic redshifts ) , which is less than the total number of galaxies and therefore the sample variance increases .",
    "a survey of larger volume would help to reduce the sample variance .",

    ", we impose the boss tiling geometry on the mocks ( see an illustration in figure  [ fig : radec ] ) .",
    "the division of @xmath76 and @xmath77 galaxies is still the same as in section  [ sub : resim ] . by definition ,",
    "all @xmath76 galaxies have fibers assigned .",
    "we then randomly assign fibers to @xmath143 5% , 71% , and 87% of @xmath77 galaxies in @xmath144 1 , 2 , and 3 regions , respectively .",
    "these fractions are consistent with those in the cmass sample . as with the simplest case ,",
    "there are about 5.5% of _ all _ galaxies left without fibers .    as explained in section  [ sub : real ] , we create separate random catalogs @xmath130 and @xmath131 for @xmath76 and @xmath85 galaxies , respectively .",
    "the @xmath130 catalog has the overall survey geometry of the mock samples . for the @xmath131 catalog , in addition to the overall geometry , we impose a random subsampling of a @xmath86 fraction of points in each individual sector .",
    "note that when applying the method on actual data , it s best to use the individual @xmath86 values in each sector for constructing @xmath131 , rather than the average value for each @xmath121 , to fully account for the distribution of @xmath85 galaxies .    the 2pcfs results from the different correction methods on the tiled mocks are shown in figure  [ fig : wptile ] .",
    "they are quite similar to those seen in figure  [ fig : wp ] for the simplified case .",
    "our correction method still accurately recovers both @xmath9 and @xmath44 over all measured scales .",
    "the errors increase only slightly , compared to the previous case , reflecting the increased sample variance ( as @xmath85 galaxies now occupy mostly the smaller tile overlap regions ) . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the errors are about @xmath145 at @xmath138 and @xmath146 at @xmath147 for one mock ( top left panel in figure  [ fig : wptile ] ) .",
    "these errors include the intrinsic fluctuation among the mocks .",
    "similar to figure  [ fig : wp ] , the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : wptile ] plot the ratios of @xmath136 and @xmath148 , reflecting the expected accuracy of the correction methods . for @xmath135 ,",
    "the correction errors for our method are about @xmath149 at @xmath138 and @xmath150 at @xmath147 for the volume of one mock .",
    "the mean ratio in each panel again demonstrates that the method is unbiased .",
    "the success of our method also implies that applying the completeness @xmath86 on the @xmath131 random catalog is the proper way to account for the angular distribution of @xmath85 galaxies .",
    "the level of accuracy and associated systematics for the nearest - neighbor and angular corrections also remain similar to those in the simplified case .",
    "we have tested as well on the mocks the recovery of the full 3d @xmath42 correlation function and its moments .",
    "the 2pcf @xmath44 in the right panels of figure  [ fig : wptile ] is the monopole of the 3d redshift space 2pcf . in figure",
    "[ fig : poles ] , we show the quadrupole @xmath63 ( left ) and hexadecapole @xmath64 ( right ) from the different correction methods . again , our method provides unbiased estimates of these quantities .",
    "note that the large error bars in the ratios near @xmath151 and @xmath152 in the bottom left panel and below @xmath153 in the bottom right panel result from the fact that the corresponding multipole is near zero at these scales .",
    "the success of our method has important implications on studying redshift - space distortions in the non - linear regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which has been hindered so far by the fiber collision effect .",
    "in contrast , the nearest neighbor method completely fails to recover the small - scale redshift distortions , because it effectively reduces the line - of - sight separations of pairs , washing out the fingers - of - god signal .",
    "residual systematics remain for it on larger scales as well .",
    "the angular correction method works reasonably well , but systematic deviations at a 10% level persist in the quadrupole and hexadecapole .",
    "on key assumption in our method presented above is that the @xmath85 galaxies are a representative ( or random ) subset of @xmath77 galaxies , which ensures that pair counts involving @xmath77 galaxies can be recovered from those involving @xmath85 galaxies in a simple way .    in reality , however , the `` representative '' assumption may not be fully satisfied , given the constraints from tiling and fiber assignment algorithm .",
    "there are two types of potential systematic effects in our correction method , when applied to the real observational data .",
    "the first is related to the possible difference in the target density between the overlap and non - overlap regions , due to specifics of the tiling algorithm .",
    "the second is related to galaxy pairs in collided triplets ( or higher - order collided groups ) . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss these two effects and provide solutions .",
    "if the tiling algorithm is optimized to assign the most fibers to the galaxy targets , it may preferentially place overlapping tiles in higher number density regions ( @xcite ; tinker et al .",
    "2011 , private communication ) .",
    "in such a case , @xmath85 galaxies come from regions of slightly higher number density , not necessarily representative of the overall @xmath77 galaxies .",
    "this may limit the accuracy of our use of @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "observationally , the impact of such potential density variations on our method can be evaluated , if we have a complete representative observed area , where all fiber - collided galaxies have been resolved by repeat observations .",
    "theoretically , a set of mocks with the actual tiling algorithm used in observations applied directly to it , can help understand the impact . since neither the required observed area nor the realistic tiled mocks are yet available , we perform various tests with our mocks to estimate the impact of the density effect .",
    "we define a galaxy density measure of the overlap regions ( `` overlap density '' ) as @xmath156 , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the number densities of galaxies in the overlap regions and the whole survey regions , respectively .",
    "then the question becomes whether the accuracy of our recovered 2pcfs depends on the value of @xmath159 .",
    "while we do not expect systematic density variations in the overlap regions in the ensemble of our tiled mocks , the variation caused by sample variance in individual mocks can be used to study the density effect .",
    "we have calculated the `` overlap density '' for each of our 40 mock catalogs using the number densities of both all the galaxies and just the @xmath77 ones , which we term as @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta ] shows the dependence of @xmath136 on the two overlap density measures , at different scales @xmath10 . in each panel ,",
    "the open circles are the measurements from the @xmath162 lasdamas mocks and the solid line is the linear least square fit to the data points . on large scales ( @xmath163 )",
    ", we find no dependence of the 2pcf on the overlap density . on small scales ( @xmath164 )",
    ", the scatter is large , but the 2pcf ratio is again consistent with no dependence on the overlap density .",
    "overall , no strong systematic dependence on either @xmath160 or @xmath161 is found over the overlap density range probed by our mocks ( @xmath165 to @xmath166 ) . to put this into the context of real observation , we calculate the overlap densities in the cmass dr9 sample and find them to be @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "based on our tests , we expect that the density effect in such a sample is not a concern .",
    "we have also verified that the angular 2pcfs of the overlap and non - overlap regions show consistent clustering amplitudes in the cmass dr9 sample , confirming that the density effect can be likely ignored .",
    "the density effect is not significant in our mocks , but there may exist another density - caused subtle effect in observational data . if @xmath85 galaxies in the overlap regions and the fiber - collided @xmath77 galaxies are not exactly the same type of galaxies given the environment difference , they might have a systematic difference in clustering .",
    "we use the cmass dr9 sample to test this and find that the @xmath85 and @xmath77 galaxies do have the same color and apparent magnitude distribution , not unexpected given that the tiling algorithm itself is just an angular selection and does not involve any physical properties of the targeting galaxies .    as a whole",
    ", our investigation suggests that the density difference between the tile overlap regions and the whole survey region does not introduce a noticeable systematic effect in our method .",
    "there is another effect that can violate the `` representative '' assumption .",
    "galaxies in the @xmath77 population can be associated with different collision groups . for @xmath77 galaxies that are part of collision pairs",
    "only ( n.b . all such pairs are @xmath76-@xmath77 or 1 - 2 pairs given that the number of @xmath76 galaxies is maximized in our division ) , @xmath85 galaxies in overlap regions are certainly a random subset of such @xmath77 galaxies .",
    "there are also @xmath77 galaxies that are part of collision triplets where the other two galaxies of each triplet are part of @xmath76 . for such @xmath77 galaxies in @xmath76-@xmath77-@xmath76 ( 1 - 2 - 1 ) triplets , @xmath85 galaxies in overlap regions",
    "are also a random subset of such @xmath77 galaxies .",
    "so the count of pairs including such @xmath77 galaxies can be well reproduced with @xmath85 galaxies in overlap regions , for the above two cases .",
    "however , for @xmath77 galaxies in collision groups , where more than two such galaxies of each group collide with each other , these @xmath106 galaxy pairs would not be appropriately recovered in most overlap regions . since",
    "galaxy triplets are expected to dominate over higher multiplets , we focus our discussion here on them .    again , given that we maximize the number of @xmath76 galaxies , the collision triplets are either 1 - 2 - 1 type or 1 - 2 - 2 type .",
    "the latter kind can not be fully recovered in @xmath169 regions ( only in @xmath170 regions ) and is thus not appropriately represented when measuring the clustering . moreover",
    ", these @xmath77 galaxies might be clustered differently than those in the previous two cases ( 1 - 2 pairs and 1 - 2 - 1 triplets ) . in our mocks ,",
    "the fraction of @xmath77 galaxies in 1 - 2 pairs , 1 - 2 - 1 triplets , and 1 - 2 - 2 triplets are @xmath171 , @xmath149 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "the collided galaxies in such 1 - 2 - 2 triplets thus make up only about @xmath173 ( 22% of 5.5% ) of the total number of galaxies .",
    "this fraction is even smaller , about @xmath174 , in the cmass dr9 sample .",
    "however , they can still have an adverse effect on the clustering measurements .    in order to assess this",
    ", we modify the way of assigning fibers to the galaxies in our mocks to mimic the real tiling algorithm . in section [ sec : sub_tile ] , the recovered @xmath77 galaxies in each sector are randomly selected according to the prescribed fraction .",
    "we now assign fibers to @xmath77 galaxies in each colliding group according to the number of tiles covering that sector .",
    "for example , for three galaxies colliding together in @xmath175 regions , at most two of them would be assigned fibers , one from @xmath76 and the other from @xmath85 .",
    "figure [ fig : cpfix ] shows the 2pcfs and the decomposition components for our method without any correction for such a `` triplet effect '' ( green lines ) compared with the true ones(open symbols and black dotted lines ) .",
    "it clearly shows that , in this case , due to the missing @xmath106 pairs the @xmath116 components on scales less than the fiber collision scale are significantly decreased .",
    "the @xmath116 term has around a @xmath176 contribution to @xmath135 on small scales , so without any correction for this the resulting @xmath135 is now significantly underestimated below the fiber collision scale , and @xmath44 is also affected .",
    "a natural solution to correct for this systematic effect is to extend equation ( [ eqn : xid ] ) to three populations@xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath177 , where @xmath77 here refers to the population of galaxies that collide with @xmath76 but not collide with each other , and @xmath177 is the rest of the galaxies , corresponding to higher - rank collision groups . equations ( [ eqn : xid ] ) and ( [ eqn : xid ] ) are then revised as , @xmath178 we refer to this correction method as `` 1 - 2 - 3 fix '' below .",
    "the limitation of this correction is the small number of resolved @xmath179 galaxies , since one needs regions covered by three or more tiles to recover @xmath177 galaxies , which only occupy a small fraction of the full survey region .",
    "therefore such a correction method would have large sample variance .",
    "another way of correcting for the collision triplets is to still use equation ( [ eqn : xid ] ) but simply add to @xmath180 the estimated missing pair counts in the tile overlap regions .",
    "the missing 2 - 2 pairs in 1 - 2 - 2 triplets are statistically equivalent to 1 - 2 pairs in such triplets .",
    "we therefore account for the unrepresented @xmath180 close pairs using the recovered @xmath103 pairs in these triplets .",
    "we denote the @xmath77 galaxies ( the definition of @xmath77 population here still follows equation  [ eqn : xid ] ) in 1 - 2 - 2 collision triplets as @xmath181 and the recovered @xmath77 galaxies in such triplets as @xmath182 . the total number of @xmath106 close pairs in each @xmath183 bin below the fiber collision scale _ in overlap regions _",
    "can then be written as follows : @xmath184 @xmath185 , \\label{eqn : tripletfix}\\ ] ] where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the numbers of @xmath181 and @xmath182 galaxies in the tile overlap regions , and @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the total and recovered number of @xmath77 galaxies in overlap regions , respectively .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ eqn : tripfix ] ) represents the resolved @xmath106 pairs in the sample ( typically only in @xmath170 regions ) , while the second term is an estimate of the missing close pairs ( mostly in @xmath175 regions ) .",
    "the expression @xmath190 is the total number of 1 - 2 pairs in 1 - 2 - 2 collision triplets , and dividing it by two gives the expected number of 2 - 2 pairs in such triplets ( since a 1 - 2 - 2 triplet has two 1 - 2 sides and one 2 - 2 side ) .",
    "note that for most triplets in overlap regions , @xmath191 , so this simply adds a missing @xmath180 pair for each @xmath192 pair .",
    "the correction term itself is then the second term in the square brackets in equation  ( [ eqn : tripletfix ] ) , adding the normalized missing pairs in 1 - 2 - 2 triplets below the fiber collision scale , and we refer to it as the `` simple fix '' .    figure [ fig : cpfix ] also shows the results of applying these two methods to the mocks with the modified fiber assignment . both corrections alleviate most of the systematics .",
    "the `` 1 - 2 - 3 '' fix is in better agreement with the underlying measurements ( in particular for @xmath44 ) , but as discussed above , it has large sample variance , leading to a @xmath19350% increase in the error bars .",
    "the simple fix reduces the bulk of the systematics , but a few percent deficit remain on small scales .",
    "this could be caused by the complicated structure of the high - order colliding groups , remaining systematics associated with the @xmath103 pair counts and sample variance .",
    "although the two correction methods proposed here are not as accurate as in the simple tiled case , they still provide workable estimates of the true 2pcfs .",
    "we regard the simple fix as the more practical one , due to its simple application and the increased sample variance of the `` 1 - 2 - 3 '' fix .",
    "we thus advocate simply incorporating the additional term ( equation  [ eqn : tripletfix ] ) into the overall method .",
    "we have explored many alternative corrections to the issue of collision groups , with varying complexity and success , and will study it farther when a more realistic set of tiled mocks or a complete fiber - collision free subsample in the boss ancillary program becomes available .",
    "we note that , as mentioned above , the lasdamas mocks have in fact @xmath194 more close triplets than the real cmass sample .",
    "thus the magnitude of the effect presented here and any residual systematics are conservative and are likely smaller in the real data .",
    "we also test the influence of the triplet effect in the mocks on the nearest neighbor and angular correction methods , as shown in figure [ fig : fix_com ] .",
    "the nearest neighbor method is mostly unaffected by this , still recovering the correct correlation function on large scales .",
    "the angular correction is impacted by the triplet effect , especially for the redshift - space correlation function , though to a lesser extent than our method . based on our tests ,",
    "the overall accuracy of our method appears to still be better than the angular correction and nearest neighbor methods .",
    "in this paper , we present a novel method for correcting the effects of fiber collisions in galaxy clustering statistics , utilizing resolved fiber collisions in tile overlap regions .",
    "the key element is dividing the target galaxy sample into two distinct populations influenced differently by the fiber collisions and combine their contributions according to equation ( [ eqn : xid ] ) . the collided galaxies , making up our so - called population 2 subsample , are partially resolved , mainly in the tile overlap regions .",
    "these resolved collided galaxies allow us to recover and measure the clustering statistics on all scales .",
    "the distinct spatial distribution of the galaxies in population 2 which were assigned fibers can be properly accounted for by their angular completeness @xmath86 in each individual tile sector .",
    "we explain the theoretical basis for our method and extensively test it on realistic mock catalogs .",
    "we demonstrate that both the projected and the 3d redshift - space 2pcfs can all be very well recovered , assuming that the recovered population 2 galaxies are representative . with that assumption ,",
    "the correction method is accurate and unbiased and limited only by sample variance .    in the real observation ,",
    "the density variations between overlap and non - overlap regions and the non - random selection of the population 2 galaxies in higher colliding groups are the main potential systematic effects .",
    "while the density effect can be largely ignored as we demonstrate in the mocks , the influence of higher colliding groups should be carefully taken into account in order to provide a reasonable estimate of the true 2pcfs .",
    "we proposed a simple fix to the missing close pairs caused by such colliding groups .",
    "the remaining systematic effect on small scale 2pcfs from such a method is expected to be lower than @xmath195 .",
    "the exact values of the systematic errors are hard to obtain , given that we are limited by the sample variance on small scales . by shifting the plate placement of the tiling geometry , we find that the deviation from the true 2pcf based on our correction method is likely to be below @xmath196 .",
    "to be conservative , we quote @xmath125 as an upper limit of the systematic errors for our method .",
    "we also contrast our method to the commonly used nearest - neighbor and angular corrections . while these approximations work well for specific statistics on some scales , they are generally not accurate enough to give an unbiased estimate over all scales . for the nearest - neighbor correction , assigning the collided galaxy the redshift of its neighbor mainly influences the line - of - sight separation @xmath45 , while @xmath10 is only changed because of the non - plane - parallel effect . for projected statistics like @xmath9 , on scales larger than the fiber - collision scale ,",
    "the pair counts are dominated by non - collided galaxies , and the nearest neighbor correction works extremely well . on small scales , however , the pair counts are dominated by collided galaxies .",
    "the nearest neighbor redshift assignment leads to an overestimate of the number of pairs within the projected separation @xmath197 and thus an overestimate of @xmath9 , which causes the nearest neighbor correction to fail . for @xmath44",
    ", the nearest - neighbor correction fails below and above the fiber - collision scale , since having the correct line - of - sight separation is more crucial , and the method does worse on all scales smaller than @xmath198 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor correction , however , is still a good estimate on very large scales .",
    "the angular correction method provides a better estimate on small scales than the nearest - neighbor one , but it is still only an approximation . by definition , the angular 2pcf @xmath199 is obtained via projecting over the whole line - of - sight depth of the survey , while the projected 2pcf @xmath9 is obtained from projection within line - of - sight separation of @xmath200 . therefore , @xmath199 and @xmath9 are not expected to be exactly the same . on small scales ,",
    "the effect of the difference in projection depth is negligible and the angular correction method works reasonably well , while on large scales it is no longer the case .",
    "in addition , for a survey with large line - of - sight depth , the mapping from @xmath14 onto @xmath10 is not unique because of the non - plane - parallel effect , further complicating the correspondence between @xmath199 and @xmath9 and making the angular correction method less accurate .",
    "we find that our correction is generally superior , better theoretically motivated and more broadly applicable , especially in its power to recover the 3d correlation functions .",
    "since the angular correction relies on the measured redshifts of the galaxies in the catalog , the systematic effects of the density variation and higher colliding group also affect the accuracy of the angular correction on small scales .",
    "our correction method can be directly applied to flux - limited survey samples .",
    "when dealing with a subsample of galaxies in certain redshift , luminosity or color bins , e.g. , volume - limited samples , the determination of @xmath76 and @xmath77 populations is not as obvious , since we do not have redshifts for the missing galaxies .",
    "but as the two populations are only separated based on their angular distribution , which is independent of redshift , luminosity or color , the determination of @xmath76 and @xmath77 populations should be made in the parent full sample , where all the galaxies satisfy the same selection criteria .",
    "the @xmath86 fractions in each sector are then also determined in the parent sample .",
    "the total number of @xmath74 galaxies in each subsample is calculated by summing up all the expected @xmath77 galaxies in each sector , @xmath201 .",
    "based on a test of subsamples of galaxies in different color bins in cmass dr9 , we find that the color distribution of @xmath85 galaxies determined in this way is the same as that of the @xmath77 galaxies , supporting our assertion that the division into the @xmath76 and @xmath77 populations is independent of the physical properties of the galaxies .",
    "in developing the new method , we have considered many other alternative corrections , such as using photometric redshifts , imposing fiber - collisions on the random catalog , applying different weights on the galaxies .",
    "we have also considered different variants in our definition of populations 1 and 2 . however , none of the many variants we have tried succeeded in robustly recovering the underlying clustering . our new method , rooted in solid theoretical ground , proves to work successfully .    for the early cmass - like mock catalogs used in this work ( @xmath202 galaxies in a volume of @xmath203 ) with imposed tiling , our correction method reaches a statistical accuracy of @xmath204 at @xmath138 and @xmath205 at @xmath147 for @xmath9 , and systematic errors of @xmath206 on small scales .",
    "the statistical errors are essentially caused by the sample variance , and thus will be reduced for larger volumes , scaling down by roughly the square root of the volume .",
    "we have verified that this scaling law holds when using subsamples of smaller volume , and the fluctuation around unity of the ratio of 2pcfs averaged over the 40 mocks in figure  [ fig : wptile ] also shows that it scales down accordingly .",
    "the current sdss - iii boss dr9 sample already covers an area of about @xmath207 , roughly @xmath208 times larger than our mocks , so our statistical correction error will be @xmath209 times smaller when applied to this sample .",
    "the final survey will cover about @xmath210 , and the correction error in @xmath135 from sample variance is expected to be @xmath211 at @xmath138 and @xmath212 at @xmath147 .",
    "the residual systematics may also scale down somewhat with the decreased sample variance , and we plan to develop a better treatment of them in future work .",
    "the method thus enables more accurate measurements of galaxy clustering statistics on small and intermediate scales .",
    "in particular , it will enable us to reliably extend the measurements to smaller scales than obtained before and to recover the full 3d redshift - space correlation functions on small scales .",
    "this will allow a better probe of the distribution of galaxies within halos .",
    "hod modeling of these new measurements will provide new constraints on the spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies inside halos .",
    "measurement and modeling of redshift - space distortions in both the linear and non - linear regimes will also improve constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "these applications will be explored in future work .",
    "we note , however , that as our method is associated with increased sample variance , due to the limited sky coverage of @xmath85 galaxies , it might not be ideal for very large scale clustering measurements , such as those performed for measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation signature @xcite . in such cases , other methods such as the nearest neighbor correction can be considered .",
    "the new method will allow for reliable galaxy clustering measurements in current and future surveys . while we were motivated by upcoming measurements in the sdss - iii boss survey , and tested the method on corresponding mock catalogs , the method can be applied to any fiber - fed large surveys such as the sdss - i and ii , 2dfgrs , and planned bigboss @xcite .",
    "we have focused here on two - point auto - correlation functions , but our methodology is more broadly applicable to other related statistics . it can be easily extended to cross - correlation functions ( see the appendix ) , which would not suffer from the systematic effect of higher - order colliding groups if the two samples of targets come from different surveys .",
    "the correction method can be further generalized to high - order statistics , e.g. , the three - point correlation function ( @xcite ; h.  guo et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) , with the effect of collision groups treated more accurately .",
    "the method can certainly be helpful in accurately measuring statistics in fourier space as well , such as the power spectrum and bispectrum of galaxies .",

    "<S> the method is rooted in solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the full three - dimensional redshift - space two - point correlation functions on scales both below and above the fiber collision scale , superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor and angular correction methods . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss potential systematic effects in our method . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical correction accuracy of our method is only limited by sample variance , which scales down with ( the square root of ) the volume probed . for a sample similar to the final sdss - iii boss galaxy sample </S>",
    "<S> , the statistical correction error is expected to be at the level of 1% on scales @xmath0@xmath1 for the two - point correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error only occurs on small scales , caused by non - perfect correction of collision multiplets , and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5% . </S>",
    "<S> our correction method , which can be generalized to other clustering statistics as well , enables more accurate measurements of full three - dimensional galaxy clustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys . </S>"
