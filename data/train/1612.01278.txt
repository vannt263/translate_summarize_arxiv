    "consider a system evolving with a hamiltonian @xmath0 for a time @xmath1 , and then backwards with a slightly different hamiltonian @xmath2 : a ` loschmidt echo ' @xcite experiment ( see , in the present context , @xcite ) .",
    "a particular case is when at time @xmath1 , the system is subjected to a rapid ` kick ' with hamiltonian @xmath3 , and subsequently is evolved back for a time @xmath1 with @xmath4 . in classical mechanics , the returning trajectory is the time - reversed of the initial trajectory , except that its beginning has been perturbed .",
    "it is clear then that if the system is chaotic , and the time @xmath1 is long enough , the return point differs from the initial point by a magnitude @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lyapunov exponent that does not depend on the nature of the kick ( for @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 is a constant that does .",
    "an analogous result holds for a quantum system if one prepares it in a localized state , and evolves it with a hamiltonian and back with a slightly perturbed hamiltonian .",
    "if one measures appropriately the overlap between the initial and the returning wavefunction , there is a regime where this difference scales exponentially in time , with the ( quantum lyapunov ) exponent independent of the perturbation between the outgoing and ingoing hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "several years ago , jalabert and pastawski @xcite showed that for a semiclassical system , and for a given range of perturbation and times , this quantum exponent corresponds to the classical one ( although an ` annealed ' version thereof , see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "consider a hermitean operator @xmath9 , which we shall assume is concentrated in some region of phase space , as seen , for example , in its coherent - state or wigner representation .",
    "we introduce a measure of the ` fidelity ' @xmath10 $ ] , comparing the operator @xmath9 with the one @xmath11 transformed by loschmidt echo trajectory . for a ` kick ' perturbation , we have : @xmath12=\\mbox{tr } \\left\\{\\left [ e^{i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h }   e^{i \\frac{\\delta}{\\hbar } b } e^{-i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h } \\right ] a \\left[e^{i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h }   e^{i \\frac{\\delta}{\\hbar } b } e^{-i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h } \\right]^\\dag a   \\right\\ } =   \\mbox{tr } \\left\\ { a e^{i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h }   e^{i \\frac{\\delta}{\\hbar } b } e^{-i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h }   a e^{i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h }   e^{-i \\frac{\\delta}{\\hbar } b } e^{-i\\frac{t}{\\hbar}h }   \\right\\}\\ ] ]    if @xmath13 we clearly get @xmath14 $ ] . putting @xmath15 and developing in powers of @xmath16 ( linear response ) @xmath17",

    "we need the operator @xmath9 to be concentrated , in order to localize our measure in a region of phase space , and to make the trace converge .",
    "two choices have been proposed .",
    "a traditional one is is to consider a localized wavefunction @xmath20 @xcite and : @xmath21 ( here in the ` kick ' version , although more commonly with a continuous perturbation @xmath22 ) .",
    "a more recent one @xcite , that lends itself better for the study of an extensive system at temperature @xmath23 , is obtained by choosing a smooth ( possibly unlocalized ) hermitean operator @xmath24 and to render it concentrated on an energy shell , at least in the thermodynamic limit , by putting in ( [ crochet ] ) : @xmath25 the symbol @xmath26 means that @xmath9 is normalized by @xmath27 .",
    "the second term only contributes a two - time function and its precise form is not relevant beyond canceling constants , we keep it for convenience here .",
    "( the regularization strategy of splitting the equilibrium density operator in factors  here four of them  is standard in chemical physics , see @xcite . ) for this form , in some cases there is a lyapunov regime : @xmath28 in this context , it has been shown that there is a bound to chaos @xcite of purely quantum nature : @xmath29",
    "in the semiclassical case , where there is no apparent limitation , the question immediately arises of how does quantum mechanics intervene .",
    "we start by considering a hamiltonian system of the form @xmath30 in the semiclassical limit @xmath31 . for the bound to be effective ,",
    "we need the product @xmath32 to be finite , and this may only be achieved in the semiclassical limit for very low temperatures , corresponding to the lowest classical energies of the system .",
    "it is clear that if the classical ground state does not have dimension larger than two , there will be no chaos : the system will sit on the classical ground state and perform vibrations and quantum fluctuations around it . in order to render the system interesting from our point of view",
    ", we consider a potential such that the minimum of @xmath33 is a manifold of dimension @xmath34 .",
    "thus , even at the lowest energies , the system will have long - distance motion ` at the bottom of the well ' .",
    "since we are interested in such a motion , we may concentrate on it by working with the quantum mechanics in the curved space of minima of the potential ( a ` quantum wire ' @xcite or ` quantum conducting surface ' problem ) .",
    "the hamiltonian restricted to that manifold is constructed as follows : we set up a system of @xmath34 curvilinear coordinates @xmath35 of the manifold of minima , and the associated momenta @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "let the metric tensor be @xmath38 so that length element @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian is proportional to the laplace beltrami operator @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the r.h.s .",
    "shows that the spectrum is positive semidefinite , including zero if and only if the system is bounded",
    ". the imaginary - time evolution with hamiltonian ( [ hamquan ] ) is just diffusion on the constrained surface .",
    "the lowest eigenvalues of ( [ hamquan ] ) indeed correspond to the inverse thermalization times associated with this diffusion process , the eigenvalue zero to the flat invariant measure .",
    "equation ( [ lyap2 ] ) can be viewed as an expectation of various observables ( correlations and responses ) of a process with four diffusion stretches lasting @xmath43 .",
    "a two - dimensional version of the constant negative curvature surface has been extensively studied as the simplest , and one of the few solvable chaotic systems , as was discussed in detail by balazs and voros @xcite , @xmath44 \\label{hyper}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the ` radius ' of the hyperboloid .",
    "the classical lyapunov exponent is @xmath46 .",
    "expectation values may be computed analytically , because eigenbases are known .",
    "we shall not do this interesting calculation here , but keep the example in mind throughout .",
    "* classical limit *    in the classical limit , the hamiltonian is given by the kinetic energy of the constrained motion : @xmath47 and the lagrangian : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the inverse of @xmath50 .",
    "the geodesic lengths are then given by the extrema of : @xmath51 because @xmath52 is a constant of motion , the lagrange equations for geodesics and for the action lead to proportional equations .",
    "we hence conclude that the classical trajectories are _ geodesics _ in the coordinate space of the @xmath35 , traversed with a velocity that is proportional to the square root of the ( purely kinetic ) energy .",
    "if the system is bounded , we may compute the equilibrium quantities via : @xmath53 @xmath54 is the energy per degree of freedom .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in going from ( [ cosa ] ) to its low - energy version ( [ hamcla ] ) , a kind of reparametrization invariance appears . given two points in _ configuration _ space and two times @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "there is a trajectory in space that will join the points in time @xmath55 and another in @xmath56 just by running over the same path at two different speeds .",
    "note that this property was absent in the original system ( [ cosa ] ) .",
    "time - reparametrization plays an important role in quantum glass models that saturate the bound ( [ bound ] ) @xcite        * classical lyapunov exponent and geodesic deviation *    let us now assume that the ground state manifold is such that the geodesics are _ chaotic_. as mentioned above , an example is the constant negative curvature surface in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "two nearby trajectories _ in phase space _ @xmath57 and @xmath58 will separate exponentially @xmath59(t ) }   \\propto \\;\\ ; e^{\\lambda t}\\ ] ] it is easy to write a differential equation for the evolution of the phase - space lyapunov vector @xmath60 , which will be as usual first order in time . in this particular case ,",
    "one may also easily eliminate @xmath61 and obtain a _",
    "second order _ differential equation for the @xmath62 ( the ` geodesic deviation ' ) exclusively .",
    "we need here only to remark that it is of the form @xcite @xmath63 , with @xmath64 quadratic in @xmath65 and linear in both the riemann curvature tensor @xmath45 and @xmath66 . in a chaotic system",
    ", the purely spatial separation is expected to scale exponentially with the geodesic length @xmath67 along the trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ remsketch ] ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 , the _ lyapunov length _ , is the typical distance travelled for the separation of two nearby trajectories to be multiplied by @xmath70 .",
    "we expect that in a system with a good thermodynamic limit , @xmath69 scales with the size as @xmath71 with @xmath72 a length that has a finite thermodynamic limit .",
    "we may understand this scaling as follows : if we consider the cartesian product of two independent chaotic systems with the same lyapunov length , and consider pairs of trajectories for both systems starting from separations @xmath73 .",
    "after a length @xmath72 travelled by _ each _ , their separations will achieve @xmath74 for both .",
    "but this happens in a combined length travelled that is now @xmath75 , while the total separation has increased only by @xmath70 .",
    "consider now the usual lyapunov exponent associated with time .",
    "it is clear that the same pair of nearby geodesics traversed at twice the speed will diverge twice as fast . because the energy is quadratic in the speed , we conclude then that : @xmath76 the right hand side confirms that @xmath72 has a good thermodynamic limit if @xmath6 also does .",
    "( the largest lyapunov value is expected to be @xmath77 in @xmath78 , although there have been some debate about how general this is , see @xcite . )",
    "a quantum system will have a thermal de broglie length defined as : @xmath79 this is a quantity _ per degree of freedom_. the wavelength along a trajectory in full phase - space will be @xmath80 times that , i.e. @xmath81 . let us compare lyapunov and debroglie lengths : @xmath82 rearranging , we find that both lengths are comparable if : @xmath83 where we omitted the numerical factors in the last , dimensional comparison .",
    "the bound ( [ bound ] ) has hence the meaning that when the thermal debroglie length is of the order or larger than the characteristic ` chaos ' length @xmath84 , the semiclassical estimate breaks down and chaoticity is bounded , see figure [ remsketch ] .",
    "it is hard to scatter a wavefront along a distance shorter than its wavelength .",
    "let us make this argument more precise .",
    "in order to do this , we make a semiclassical calculation in a way that closely resembles the one of jalabert and pastawski @xcite .",
    "we sketch the calculation here and leave the details for the appendix .",
    "we have to compute ( [ lyap2 ] ) , the first term of which is @xmath85    we rescale quantities using : @xmath86 the value of @xmath87 is the typical distance traveled by a classical particle at temperature @xmath88 , it is much longer than the thermal length . to recap , we have three quantities , @xmath72 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 : ` spatial divergence ' , thermal debroglie and trajectory lengths , respectively",
    ".    we shall now write the real and imaginary time propagations as : @xmath91 } = e^{-\\frac{i\\hat t } { \\ell } \\bar h } \\hspace{.7 cm } ; \\hspace{.7 cm }   \\mbox{imag .",

    "we recognize the real time propagations as semiclassical , with @xmath89 playing the role usually played by @xmath94 . as to the imaginary propagations , it is diffusion in curved space with ` noise ' of small amplitude @xmath95 .",
    "let us introduce a basis : @xmath96 we now use the fact that the real time propagations are semiclassical , and that the diffusions are over very small @xmath97 lengths ( fig .",
    "[ trajectory ] ) .",
    "we first write the short diffusion episodes introducing @xmath77 lengths @xmath98 : @xmath99 and compute ( appendix ) , to leading order in @xmath89 : @xmath100 and similarly for @xmath101 ( one may omit constant prefactors , as they appear in the denominator too ) .",
    "note that the @xmath102 play the role of velocities in the lagrangian @xmath52 .",
    "for the integral , we have : @xmath103    next , we introduce the van vleck formula for the semiclassical propagator : @xmath104 we have to take into account the shifts of @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the brackets . using the fact that the derivative of the classical action @xmath107 with respect to the coordinate gives the momentum , we may put : @xmath108 where @xmath109 denote the classical momentum at the time corresponding to @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the shifts @xmath98 in the @xmath112 are negligible , since they are of @xmath97 .",

    "the expectations with two @xmath121 contribute only to connected two - time correlations that have decayed in the time regime that we are studying because chaos leads to cancellations ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we are left with the expectation containing four @xmath121 , which , after rearrangement , may be expressed in terms of classical poisson brackets . assembling all the pieces together , we get the final , purely classical , result : @xmath122 where we have defined the classical adimensional hamiltonian @xmath123 the meaning of this formula is clear",
    ". we are summing over trajectories of different ( rescaled ) speeds , starting at all points , and weighted with the gibbs measure .",
    "the time is the rescaled time @xmath90 , which accounts for the absence of the temperature in the exponent , so that this expression is , for given @xmath90 , purely geometrical .",

    "* canonical vs. micro - canonical *    for systems with few degrees of freedom , quantities have thermal fluctuations , and there is no single velocity associated with all trajectories in ( [ exp1 ] ) .",

    "introducing a delta function and rescaling with the energy density @xmath124 @xmath125 we have :    @xmath126    ( we have dropped the subindex @xmath127 in the arguments @xmath128 ) . putting all together we may write : @xmath129+n{\\cal{s } } }   \\;\\ ;   { \\bf \\langle } \\hspace{-.07cm}{\\bf \\langle } \\{b_{f},w_i\\}^2{\\bf \\rangle}\\hspace{-.07 cm } { \\bf \\rangle}(2 \\pi \\hat t ) } {    \\int d { \\cal{e}}_o e^{-n { \\cal{e}}_o+\\frac{n-1}2 \\ln [ 2 { \\cal{e}}_o]+n{\\cal{s } } } }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is a purely geometric contribution to the entropy , and @xmath131 the delta function imposes unit speed .",

    "if the system has a single characteristic length @xmath45 , as for example the case of the pseudosphere , whose only parameter is its ` radius ' @xmath45 , then the classical lyapunov exponent scales with this length , and there is only the question of how does the thermal debroglie length compare with the geometric one . as we consider longer quantum wavelengths , the semiclassical approximation becomes less good , and in the regime where the wavelength becomes large with respect to all the geometrical features completely breaks down .",
    "it is not even clear that a lyapunov regime  exponentially dependent on @xmath1 and independent of @xmath141 and @xmath24  exists for the loschmidt echo , and one would expect that chaoticity becomes smaller .    in the example of the motion on the pseudosphere ,",
    "the hamiltonian has a continuous spectrum starting from a lowest eigenvalue @xcite @xmath142 the same system bounded to a large region , will have a similar spectrum ( this time not continuous ) , plus a ` flat ' state of eigenvalue zero @xmath143 .",
    "let us compare the thermal energy with the lowest nonzero eigenvector : @xmath144 we see what happens when @xmath89 becomes larger than @xmath72 : the factor in the exponent of @xmath145 projects onto the lowest , non - propagating mode .",
    "we may think of the evolution as diffusion over a long time @xmath146 , larger than the ergodic time of the diffusive system .",
    "we may estimate that the result of @xmath147 for @xmath148 is , up to exponentially small @xmath149 : @xmath150 where @xmath151 denotes flat averages over the manifold .",
    "again , it seems doubtful that there is chaos in this regime @xmath152 ( the gray region ) , and it is not even clear whether a lyapunov exponent independent of @xmath153 , governing an exponential relaxation , still exists .",
    "is it possible to have chaos all the way down to zero temperature ?",
    "it is easy to construct a ( very artificial ) model that does .",
    "for this we have to use the fact , already mentioned above , that the lyapunov exponent of the cartesian product of two weakly or non - interacting systems is just the largest of the exponents of the individual systems .",
    "consider then a @xmath154 dimensional system composed of @xmath78 hyperbolic systems like ( [ hyper ] ) , each with typical ` radius ' @xmath155 .",
    "the total lyapunov of the combined system will be composed of the envelope of the highest of the curves of fig .",
    "[ trajectory1 ] , each one with a characteristic @xmath156 .",
    "in such a case , one may imagine that as one moves into the deeper quantum regime ( longer thermal lengths ) , the wave propagation ignores the shorter geometric lengths but is scattered by the longest . in a system with regions with all levels of curvature , the quantum lyapunov",
    "would then be governed by the smaller curvature of the order of the inverse debroglie length , and this is compatible with @xmath139 stabilizing as the thermal length becomes longer and longer .",
    "the example of critical opalescence comes to mind : at exactly the critical point there are fluctuations of density  and hence of refractive index  at all scales , and the fluid looks white because it scatters all wavelengths .",
    "it is tempting to compare the situation with systems like syk that saturate the bound at exactly zero temperature and have a critical , gapless point there .",
    "the example of a particle moving on a curved surface , or of a ` bosonic ' system with a classical ground - state manifold of high dimension , is a context where one may picture the action of the quantum bounds on chaos in an intuitive way",
    ". it would be interesting to discuss the effect of ` driving ' such a system , and computing transport and dissipation coefficients , and the limits quantum mechanics places upon them .",
    "another interesting exercise would to obtain a bound that applies to the loschmidt echo in the more conventional setting of a wave packet with typical energy @xmath157 , rather than in the canonical ensemble .",
    "it seems clear that some such bound should exist , and would be useful for systems with few degrees of freedom .",
