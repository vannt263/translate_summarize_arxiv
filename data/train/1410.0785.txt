    "the use of the bvp fundamental solution makes the method presented here applicable in a range of situations for which ivp based methods are ill suited , namely when the ivp fundamental solution or its inverse has a ` large ' norm but the corresponding bvp fundamental solution and green s function has a ` moderately sized ' norm .",
    "this is often the case in singularly perturbed problems and so the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on two such examples in section [ sec : num_tests ] .",

    "a limitation of this method is that the stability properties of an ivp take center stage ; the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 feature critically in the error estimates derived in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately there are situations in which a bvp of interest is stable whereas the corresponding ivp is not . in such situations",
    "the bounds obtained by the ivp fundamental solution method will be very pessimistic due to the large size of @xmath50 and/or @xmath51 .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "perhaps the simplest test problem that exhibits these features is the bvp @xmath52 the corresponding ivp fundamental solution matrix and its inverse are @xmath53 these have exponentially increasing norms as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that the value and derivative of the exact solution @xmath55 have @xmath56 norm .",
    "even if one tries to avoid separately bounding the norms of @xmath49 and @xmath57 and take advantage of the cancellation that can occur in @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the above example is sufficient to show that this cancellation does not in general occur over the entire @xmath60 domain ; the @xmath61 component of the former quantity is given by @xmath62 which diverges at @xmath63 , @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "even if cancellation does occur , it is difficult to compute @xmath44 and @xmath66 to high enough accuracy that one could take advantage of such cancellation .    in summary , while the ivp fundamental solution method suffices for problems whose ivp is stable , if one is interested in bvps whose corresponding ivp is unstable then an alternative method is needed .",
    "our contribution is designed to address such situations by utilizing the bvp fundamental solution and green s function in place of the ivp fundamental solution .",
    "we are now in position to begin discussing an alternative method for producing a posteriori existence proofs and error bounds based on the bvp fundamental solution .",
    "this method will be called the bvp fundamental solution method , or bvp method for short , in contrast to the ivp method .",
    "the bvp fundamental solution is introduced in the following section , but first we discuss the function spaces that will be used in our analysis .",
    "the input to any a posteriori method consists of a certain ( numerically generated ) approximate solution . for us",
    "this will consist of function values on a mesh @xmath67 . before error bounds can be produced , these need to be extended to an approximate solution on the entire interval @xmath11 $ ] . while one could work in spaces of continuous functions by interpolating the values at the nodes , as done in the ivp method",
    ", we will find things more convenient ( and the resulting error bounds more transparent ) when this assumption is removed , both from the solution space and the matrix @xmath36 . in this section",
    "we outline the slightly generalized framework in which the equations will be formulated .    to this end , fix a mesh , @xmath68 , as above and let @xmath69 be the space of functions that are piecewise continuous on this mesh .",

    ", we will take @xmath72 to be diagonal and choose the diagonal elements to balance the magnitude of the errors in the different components of the solution .",
    "one could consider the generalization where the weight is allowed to vary between subintervals but this will not be explored here .",
    "@xmath69 is a banach space and the maps that send any @xmath73 to its value at any @xmath74 or at @xmath75 ( @xmath76 denots limit from above , @xmath77 limit from below ) are well defined bounded linear maps .",
    "elements of @xmath69 can be identified with elements of @xmath78 and integration or differentiation ( of piecewise @xmath18 ) elements of @xmath69 will be defined using this identification .    mirroring the continuous case , ( [ x_def ] ) ,",

    "finally , note that the @xmath82 s are closed subspaces of the @xmath83 s . for simplicity",
    "we will take @xmath84 .",
    "this will allow us to drop the subscript @xmath72 s from the above norms in the following sections .",
    "having specified the functional analytic framework , the definition of nonlinear bvps can be extended to this setting by defining @xmath85 by the same formula as in ( [ g_def ] ) . note that any zero of this map is automatically continuous , and so solutions of the generalized problem are still in 1 - 1 correspondence with solutions of the original bvp .",
    "the extended operator @xmath28 is still frchet-@xmath18 , with the same formula for the derivative ( [ df_formula ] ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath86 is no longer continuous as a function of @xmath87 for a general @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , in the interest of applying newton - kantorovich to prove existence , we are lead to consider bounded linear maps @xmath89 defined as in ( [ lin_bvp ] ) , where the assumptions on @xmath40 are relaxed to allow for piecewise continuity on the given mesh .",
    "we are now in position to discuss the bvp fundamental solution , on which our method will be based .",
    "a bvp fundamental solution is defined as a continuous and piecewise @xmath18 solution to @xmath90 consisting of invertible matrices .",

    "the meaning will be clear from the context .",
    "theorem [ lin_bvp_solution ] is essentially found in @xcite .",
    "the only complications beyond the presentation there is that @xmath36 is only piecewise continuous and @xmath41 must be taken to be an arbitrary continuous function that vanishes at @xmath63 , not necessarily one of the form @xmath96 for some continuous @xmath97 , as would be the case when transforming from the differential to the integral form of the bvp .",
    "one can directly verify the formula by composing ( [ f_inv_formula ] ) with ( [ lin_bvp ] ) and vice versa .",

    "<S> we present a computer assisted method for generating existence proofs and a posteriori error bounds for solutions to two point boundary value problems ( bvps ) . </S>",
    "<S> all truncation errors are accounted for and , if combined with interval arithmetic to bound the rounding errors , the computer generated results are mathematically rigorous . </S>",
    "<S> the method is formulated for @xmath0-dimensional systems and does not require any special form for the vector field of the differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> it utilizes a numerically generated approximation to the bvp fundamental solution and green s function and thus can be applied to stable bvps whose initial value problem is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of the method is demonstrated on a pair of singularly perturbed model bvps and by using it to rigorously show the existence of a periodic orbit in the lorenz system .    </S>",
