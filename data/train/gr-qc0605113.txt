    "observations suggest that the current universe is dominated by a matter component which leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe called dark energy ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "this has stimulated a study that our universe may face a future singularity .",
    "such future singularities typically arise if the universe is dominated by matter which violates dominant energy condition and causes a state of super - acceleration of the universe before leading it to a singularity .",
    "they can occur due to divergence either of the energy density @xmath1 and/or the pressure density @xmath2 of the matter content .",
    "for example if the universe is filled with a phantom dark energy with a constant equation of state @xmath3 less than @xmath4 @xcite , this leads to a big rip singularity at which both @xmath1 and @xmath2 diverge with a finite time @xcite .",
    "barrow pointed out a possibility to obtain a sudden future singularity at which @xmath1 is finite but @xmath2 diverges @xcite .",
    "depending on the equation of state of dark energy , future singularities have been categorized in different classes @xcite .",
    "existence of future singularities in friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology reflects the vulnerability of standard friedmann dynamics whenever @xmath1 or @xmath2 become of the order of planck values .",
    "this indicates that limit of validity of general relativity has been reached and inputs from quantum gravity are necessary to probe the dynamics near the singularity .",
    "resolution of singularities using wheeler - dewitt quantization has been attempted @xcite but has met with little success .",
    "one of the primary reasons for its failure has been a lack of a fundamental theory which can guide quantization in the wheeler - dewitt framework .",
    "issue of resolution of past @xcite and future singularities @xcite have been investigated using perturbative corrections in string theoretic models .",
    "these analysis indicate that generic resolution of singularities may only be accomplished using non - perturbative corrections . in particular in the absence of an analysis which uses non - perturbative quantum gravitational modifications to model the dynamics of dark energy , the fate of future singularities",
    "has remained an open problem .",
    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is a leading background independent non - perturbative quantization of gravity @xcite which has been very well understood in the cosmological setting in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite . to its success",
    ", lqg has dealt with various singularities in cosmological setting @xcite and techniques have also been used to resolve singularities in black hole spacetimes @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have revealed that non - perturbative loop quantum effects lead to a @xmath0 modification of the friedmann equation with a negative sign @xcite .",
    "the modification becomes important when energy density of the universe becomes of the same order of a critical density @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting dynamics generically leads to a bounce when our flat expanding universe is evolved backwards @xcite .    since important insights",
    "have been gained on resolution of space - like singularities in lqc , it offers a natural arena to investigate the fate of future singularities .",
    "this is the goal of the present work . using the effective friedmann dynamics which has emerged from lqc",
    "we would analyze the way non - perturbative quantum gravitational effects modify the dynamics near future singularities .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we would briefly review the way an effective modified friedmann dynamics is obtained from the discrete quantum dynamics in lqc . since , wheeler - dewitt quantization , which like lqc is a mini - superspace approach , has been unsuccessful in resolving space - like singularities we would highlight some differences which emerge with lqc ( for details see ref.@xcite ) . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze in detail the fate of three types of future singularities type i ( the big rip ) : scale factor @xmath6 , energy density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 becoming infinite in finite time , type ii ( sudden ) : @xmath2 becoming infinite with finite @xmath1 in finite time , and type iii : @xmath1 and @xmath2 diverging with finite @xmath6 in finite time .",
    "we will show the lqc can successfully resolve type i and type iii singularities for generic choice of initial conditions .",
    "resolution of type ii singularities though depends on the amplitude of model parameters .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results in sec .",
    "in lqg the phase space of classical general relativity is expressed in terms of su(2 ) connection @xmath7 and densitized triads @xmath8 . in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , due to underlying symmetries of the frw spacetime the phase space structure simplifies and can be casted in terms of canonically conjugate connection @xmath9 and triad @xmath10 which satisfy @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is gravitational constant ) and @xmath14 is the dimensionless barbero - immirzi parameter ( which is set by the black hole thermodynamics in lqg , as @xmath15 ) . on the space of physical solutions of general relativity they are related to scale factor and its time derivative as : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the elementary variables used for quantization in lqc are the triads and holonomies of connection over edges of loops : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are related to pauli spin matrices as @xmath20 and @xmath21 is related to the length of the edge over which holonomy is evaluated .",
    "the algebra generated by holonomies is that of almost periodic functions of @xmath9 with elements of the form : @xmath22 . on quantization , though holonomies have well defined quantum operators there are no quantum operators for @xmath9 in lqc ( as in lqg ) .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space in lqc is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the bohr compactification of the real line and @xmath25 is the haar measure on it .",
    "note that the hilbert space is different from the one in wheeler - dewitt quantization : @xmath26 .",
    "the triad and thus the scale factor operator in lqc have a discrete eigenvalue spectrum and quantum constraint , obtained by expressing the classical constraint in terms of holonomies and positive powers of triad and then quantized , in lqc leads to a discrete quantum difference equation whose _ all _ solutions are non - singular  another important distinction from the wheeler - dewitt theory .",
    "physical predictions can be extracted from lqc by construction of a physical hilbert space . by identifying dirac observables on this space , information about dynamics",
    "can be extracted using ideas of emergent time .",
    "on constructing coherent states we can then find out the expectation values of dirac observables and compare the quantum dynamics with the classical one .",
    "it turns out that when a flat expanding universe is evolved backward using loop quantum dynamics , instead of ending in big bang singularity it bounces at planck scale to a contracting branch @xcite .",
    "the coherent states used to analyze the details of quantum dynamics also play an important role in obtaining an effective hamiltonian description of dynamics governed by quantum difference equation .",
    "this can be done by using methods of geometric formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite where one notes that quantum hilbert space can be regarded as a quantum phase space with a bundle structure .",
    "the classical phase space forms the base of this bundle , whereas fibers consist of states with same expectation values of conjugate variables .",
    "horizontal sections of the bundle are isomorphic to the classical phase space .",
    "using coherent states one can then find horizontal sections which are preserved by quantum evolution which then leads us to an effective hamiltonian with loop quantum modifications @xcite : c_= - a ^2(| ) + c _  . here",
    "@xmath27 is the kinematical length of the edge of a square loop which has the area given by the minimum eigenvalue of the area operator in lqg @xcite and @xmath28 corresponds to matter hamiltonian which in general contains modifications due to regularization of inverse scale factor @xcite .",
    "these modifications are negligible for large universes and would not be considered in the present work .",
    "the modified friedmann equation can then be obtained by using the hamilton s equation : = \\{,c _ } = - in the effective hamiltonian constraint @xmath29 : [ basic1 ] h^2= ( 1- ) , with @xmath30 @xcite where @xmath31 is planck constant . along with the conservation law : [ basic2 ] + 3h(+p)=0 , eq .  ( [ basic1 ] ) provides an effective description of friedmann dynamics which very well approximates the underlying discrete quantum dynamics and confirms with the picture of bounce which occurs when @xmath32 ( of the order of planck density ) @xcite . in the classical limit @xmath33 one has @xmath34 , thus classically non - singular bounce is absent .",
    "further , for @xmath35 the modified friedmann equation reduces to the standard one .",
    "interestingly @xmath0 modifications also appear in string inspired braneworld scenarios and it turns out that there exist interesting dualities between two frameworks @xcite . however , such modifications in braneworlds usually appear with a positive sign and a bounce is absent ( unless one assumes existence of two time - like dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "we will now address the issue of future singularities in the effective dynamics of lqc .",
    "our treatment of matter which leads to such singularities would be phenomenological and at an effective level ( as in ref .",
    "for the analysis of the fate of future singularities in lqc , it is useful to first obtain the rate of change of hubble parameter from eqs .",

    "<S> non - perturbative quantum geometric effects which lead to @xmath0 modification of the friedmann equation at high energies result in generic resolution of singularities whenever energy density @xmath1 diverges at future singularities of friedmann dynamics . such quantum effects lead to the avoidance of a big rip , which is followed by a recollapsing universe stable against perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> resolution of sudden singularity , the case when pressure diverges but energy density approaches a finite value depends on the ratio of the latter to a critical energy density of the order of planck . </S>",
    "<S> if the value of this ratio is greater than unity , the universe escapes the sudden future singularity and becomes oscillatory . </S>"
