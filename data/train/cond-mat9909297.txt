    "peak effect ( pe ) phenomenon relates to an anomalous behavior of ( macroscopic ) current carrying capacity in the mixed state of a type ii superconductor .",
    "the critical current density @xmath5 of a superconductor , which usually decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath9 or @xmath10 , can show an anomalous increase before proceeding to zero at or close to the superconducting to normal phase boundary ( @xmath11/@xmath12 line ) .",
    "the occurrence of pe , ubiquitous in conventional low temperature superconductors , has received a considerable amount of attention in recent years @xcite . a large variety of superconducting systems exhibit pe , such as , nb ( pure metal ) @xcite , v@xmath0si ( @xmath13 compound ) @xcite , 2@xmath9-nbse@xmath14 ( layered chalcogenide ) @xcite , rare earth intermetallics , like , ceco@xmath14@xcite and ceru@xmath14@xcite , yb@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 ( ternary stannide ) @xcite , yni@xmath14b@xmath14c ( quarternary borocarbide ) @xcite , upd@xmath14al@xmath0 ( heavy fermion superconductor)@xcite , yba@xmath14cu@xmath0o@xmath15 ( high temperature superconductor ) @xcite , etc . of the various scenarios being considered to understand pe phenomenon ,",
    "two appear distinct and independent . a classical scenario , originally due to pippard @xcite , attempts to relate pe to a faster rate of decrease in elastic moduli of fll with increase in temperature as compared to that of the elementary pinning force .",
    "a recent scenario due to tachiki et al @xcite , suggests that pe phenomenon in heavy fermion superconductors ( hfs ) could be caused as a first order transition by the realization of a generalized fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( gfflo ) @xcite state at high fields and low temperatures ( @xmath10  @xmath16  0.55@xmath17(0 ) ) .",
    "the rare earth and uranium based superconductors have large normal state paramagnetism , and in the superconducting mixed state of these systems , the order parameter can assume a spatial modulation ( with nodes in the longitudinal direction ) at high fields such that the vortex line ( then ) comprises coupled segments of lengths comparable to wavelength of modulation in superconducting order parameter .",
    "the inevitably present pinning centres in the sample enhance their pinning action on such vortex lines at the onset of gfflo transition and thereby cause pe phenomenon .",
    "+ modler et al @xcite have shown that the characteristics of several physical properties in the pe region of a single crystal of the heavy fermion compound upd@xmath14al@xmath0 are similar to those in a single crystal of the mixed valent compound ceru@xmath14 and the phase boundaries ( locus of @xmath9 and @xmath10 values ) drawn for upd@xmath14al@xmath0 and ceru@xmath14 extend over similar parametric limits in the @xmath6 space@xcite .",

    "the latter system , 2@xmath9-nbse@xmath14 , is thought to be an archetypal example for the classical scenario of collapse of elastic moduli of flux line lattice ( fll ) ( implying a thermal and/or disorder induced amorphization of the fll@xcite ) as a source of pe .",
    "very recently , banerjee et al @xcite have shown that in crystals of 2@xmath9-nbse@xmath14 and ceru@xmath14 , having comparable levels of pinning , the pe phenomenon comprises a rich structure that can be construed as an evidence of a stepwise fracturing of the vortex lattice at or near the incipient fll melting transition in both the systems .",
    "it is asserted @xcite that the destruction of the elastically deformed vortex solid commences at the onset of pe via a pinning - induced fracturing transition and the amorphization of the vortex solid proceeds to completion at the peak position of pe due to juxtaposition of effects caused by thermal fluctuations and quenched random disorder . between the onset and the peak positions of the pe , the vortex solid",

    "the pe region in ca@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 spans two sharp transitions located at its @xmath3 and @xmath4 positions and a characteristic hysteretic effect is observed on thermal cycling across the transition located at the onset .",
    "prior to the peak position of the pe , the state of the vortex array and its current carrying capacity @xmath5 depends on its thermomagnetic history , i.e. , @xmath5 in the vortex array created in the field cooled ( fc ) manner is much larger than that in the zero field cooled ( zfc ) manner@xcite .",
    "the isothermal dc magnetization hysteresis experiments also reveal a characteristic path dependence in @xmath5 .",

    "ravikumar et al @xcite have focussed attention on to the differences in the magnetization values in the pe region of ceru@xmath14 and 2@xmath9-nbse@xmath14 obtained by hst and fs analysis .",
    "we have noted similar differences for ca@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 crystal as well and have , therefore , used the hst procedure to acquire the dc magnetization data reported here .",
    "i. isofield ac susceptibility measurements    figures 1(a ) , 1(b ) , and 1(c ) show the temperature dependence of the real part of the ac susceptibility ( @xmath24 ) for a ca@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 crystal in various dc bias fields maintained parallel to the [ 001 ] plane of the crystal .",
    "the fll was prepared in the zero field cooled ( zfc ) mode ( i.e. , the superconducting sample was initially cooled to the lowest temperature in zero magnetic field and subsequently a given value of the dc field was applied ) .",
    "the screening response was then measured while warming up the sample .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the typical variation of @xmath24 in low applied fields ( 0  -  2.5 koe ) . in zero field , @xmath24 response shows perfect screening ( @xmath25 -1 ) at low temperatures and a sharp transition towards normal state near the superconducting transition temperature @xmath22 . as the applied field increases , the superconducting to normal transition broadens and @xmath24 rises monotonically to its normal state value at @xmath12 .",
    "however , for an applied dc field of 3.5  koe , as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "1(b ) , this monotonic behaviour is interrupted by an anomalous dip in @xmath24 at a temperature denoted as @xmath26 (=  7.43  k  at  3.5  koe ) .    within the bean s critical state model ( csm ) @xcite ,",
    "@xmath24 can be approximated as , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a geometry dependent factor , @xmath29 is the applied ac field and @xmath5 is the critical current density .",
    "the above relation implies that the dip in @xmath24 is a consequence of enhancement in @xmath5 , the ubiquitous peak effect . as the dc bias field",

    "1(b ) transforms to a double peak structure , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "this two - dip structure becomes progressively more prominent as the dc field increases and the peak effect phenomenon eventually comprises two very sharp ( @xmath16  5  mk width ) first order like transitions as implied by the data in fig .",
    "for instance , in a field of 10 koe in fig .",
    "1(c ) , @xmath24 displays a sharp ( @xmath16  5 mk ) dip at t = @xmath31 ( the so called @xmath3 temperature of the peak effect ) , followed by another sharp dip at t = @xmath7 ( the @xmath4 temperature ) . above @xmath7",

    "the occurrence of sharp changes in @xmath5 at the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 positions of the pe were not apparent in isothermal @xmath32 scans performed earlier by tomy et al @xcite in the same crystal .",
    "however , the @xmath33 values observed in the present isofield measurements show good agreement with @xmath34 values reported by tomy et al @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note how rapidly the pe regime evolves with increasing field .",
    "a more than ten - fold increase can be noted in the extent of the anomalous dip in @xmath24 values characterising the pe between @xmath30  =  3.5  koe and 5  koe . also , the recovery of @xmath24 above @xmath7 to its normal state value becomes steeper as the field increases ( cf .",

    "below 5  koe , one can hardly distinguish between @xmath31 and @xmath7 values of the pe , and @xmath31 and @xmath7 curves appear to merge at a multicritical point corresponding to @xmath33/@xmath22  @xmath35  0.9 in the phase diagram .",
    "the lowest field down to which a residual signature of a peak could be ascertained in our data is 3.5  koe which corresponds to a @xmath36 value of about 0.91 .",
    "isothermal dc magnetization results    in order to further explore the different facets of pe observed in the ac susceptibility measurements , isothermal dc magnetization hysteresis measurements were also performed on the same crystal .",
    "the results at two temperatures are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "magnetization curves were recorded for increasing as well as decreasing field cycles over a total scan length of 4  cm using the new hst as well as the conventional fs method on a squid magnetometer .",
    "the magnetization data recorded at 4.5  k shows a clear hysteresis in the field interval 15  -19  koe between the forward(@xmath37 ) and the reverse(@xmath38 ) legs of the field sweep . according to the bean s critical state model ( csm ) @xcite",
    ", this hysteresis in magnetization @xmath39  =  @xmath40 ) provides a measure of the macroscopic critical current density @xmath41 and is a distinct indicator of the occurrence of the pe .",
    "the field where the magnetization hysteresis bubble is widest identifies the peak field @xmath8 and the collapse of hysteresis locates the irreversibility field @xmath42 , above which the critical current density falls below the measurable limit of the method used ( see fig .  2 ) .    in the main panel of fig .  2 at 4.5 k",
    ", it is apparent that the hysteresis width in the peak effect region measured by the hst is significantly larger ( and the hysteresis bubble is much more symmetric ) than that measured using the conventional fs procedure .",
    "it is also to be noted that the use of hst results in measurable values of magnetization hysteresis below the onset of the pe , whereas the fs method results in the near absence of magnetization hysteresis in the same field region .",
    "the observed distinction is important in the sense that the isofield ac susceptibility measurements show diamagnetic @xmath24 response ( see figs 1(a ) to 1(c ) ) prior to the arrival of pe regime , which clearly demands that the dc magnetization should not be reversible prior to pe ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the efficacy and the necessity of the hst employed in our isothermal dc magnetization measurements .",
    "to illustrate the point even further , the two insets of fig .  2",
    "show a comparison of magnetization hysteresis data obtained by hst and fs method at 6.1  k , where the peak field is expected to be about 10  koe ( cf .",
    "1(c ) ) . a clear signature of the pe can be observed in dc magnetization measurements only if the @xmath44 is used .",
    "even while the pe hysteretic bubble recorded with hst at 4.5  k is more symmetric than that recorded with fs method , and undoubtedly the proper technique to utilise , nevertheless the difference in fields marking the onset and offset of pe in the forward and reverse legs of the bubble persists , i.e. , @xmath45 , i.e. , this feature is not an artifact of the method used but is a characteristic property of the system .",
    "such differences in the @xmath3 ( @xmath46 ) and the @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) fields of the pe have been widely noticed in several low @xmath17 and high @xmath17 systems , like , upd@xmath14al@xmath0@xcite , ceru@xmath14@xcite , 2@xmath9-nbse@xmath14@xcite , yb@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2@xcite , yba@xmath14cu@xmath0o@xmath15@xcite , etc .",
    ", and have led to the proposition that the onset of the pe is akin to a first order phase transition@xcite .",
    "a first order change allows for the possibility of the existence of thermal hysteresis and the path dependence in the values of some physical variables , which in our case is the current density @xmath5 .",
    "i. isofield ac susceptibility study :    we have explored the thermomagnetic history effects in @xmath5 in the pe region through the temperature dependent ac susceptibility measurements .",
    "two different sample histories , viz . , the zfc and the fc , commonly associated with disordered magnets such as spin glasses , were investigated . in the fc mode ,",
    "the sample was rapidly cooled down from the normal state in the presence of an applied dc field and then the measurements were performed while warming up the fll ( i.e. , the field - cooled warm up ( fcw ) mode ) .",
    "figure  3 displays the typical response of @xmath24 for two thermomagnetic histories in a field of 10  koe in ca@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "the fll states in the fcw mode can be seen to give larger diamagnetic screening response as compared to those produced via zfc mode over a wide range of temperature , up to the peak position of the pe .    since the macroscopic current density @xmath5 is directly related to the @xmath24 response ( eq.1 )",
    ", the differences in @xmath24 responses between the zfc and fcw modes reveal the history dependence of the macroscopic critical current density @xmath5 in those modes , i.e. , @xmath49 for @xmath50 . in an earlier report ,",
    "banerjee et al @xcite have exhibited the same kind of history dependence in single crystals of ceru@xmath14 and 2@xmath9-nbse@xmath14 .",
    "also , from a small angle neutron scattering study , huxley et al @xcite have surmised that the fc state in ceru@xmath14 comprises more finely divided regions of correlated lattice as compared to those in the zfc state .",
    "the difference in zfc and fcw responses was finally found to disappear at the peak position of the pe , somewhat akin to the magnetic responses in spin glasses where the zfc and fc magnetization curves merge at the spin glass transition temperature @xmath51 @xcite . unlike the spin glasses , where the glass temperature @xmath51 could display measurable differences on variation of the frequency and the amplitude of the ac field , at least in the vortex system in ca@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 ( see fig .",

    "the observed robust independence of @xmath31 and @xmath7 on the amplitude and especially on the frequency , further attests to the first order nature of the transformations and the consequent absence of pretransitional fluctuation effects , such as , critical slowing down , etc .. + ii .",

    "5 summarises the magnetization hysteresis curves recorded after obtaining the vortex states in fc mode at fields lying well below as well as within the pe region at @xmath10  =  4.5  k. as per csm description of magnetization hysteresis data @xcite ,",
    "when the critical current density is uniquely prescribed for a vortex state at a given @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the single - valuedness of @xmath41 demands that all the magnetization values obtained along various paths with different thermomagnetic histories should lie within the envelope loop defined by the forward and the reverse branches of the magnetization curve obtained in isothermal dc magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "the dc magnetization data illustrated in fig.5 go beyond the above description and elucidate the multi - valued nature of @xmath41 .",

    "the magnetization values fall sharply and merge into the usual envelope loop ( to be identified by the thin continuous lines in fig . 5 ) .",
    "the @xmath55 by the initial magnetization values clearly indicates that the @xmath5 value at a given field @xmath9 in the fc state is higher than that in the zfc state , in good agreement with the isofield ac susceptibility measurements discussed earlier .",
    "the observation that the fc magnetization curves eventually merge into the zfc magnetization curve ( i.e. , the envelope loop ) implies that the more strongly pinned fc vortex state heals to a more ordered zfc state as the vortex state adjusts to a large enough change @xmath56 in the external dc field@xcite .",
    "this change @xmath56 in the dc field required to anneal a given fc state to a neighbouring zfc like state also increases as @xmath9 approaches the peak field @xmath8 , where the lattice is nearly amorphous@xcite ( @xmath56 varies from @xmath35  2  koe in the pe regime to @xmath35  80  oe down to very low field far away from the pe regime ) .",
    "the @xmath55 by the fc magnetization curve is however absent for field cooling in a field @xmath57 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "in such a case , the fc magnetization curve readily merges with the reverse envelope curve , since the history effect in @xmath5 disappears at the peak position of the pe , as seen earlier in the temperature dependent ac susceptibility data as well .",

    "a novel feature of this hysteretic response across @xmath31 is that it is like an open hysteresis loop , i.e. , the @xmath24 response can never by itself ( at @xmath65 ) recover to the zfc like response .",
    "on cooling down further , the new @xmath24 curve ( fcc from @xmath59 ) cuts across the fcw response , thereby , becoming relatively less diamagnetic than the fcw curve down to the lowest temperature ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "the macroscopic critical current density @xmath5 in the presence of pinning is given by the pinning force equation@xcite : @xmath93^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent the pinning parameter and the correlation volume of a larkin domain within which the fll is undistorted and well correlated despite the presence of pinning . in the above equation , @xmath96 is the density of pinning centers ( pins ) , @xmath97 is the elementary pinning interaction proportional to the condensation energy and @xmath98 and @xmath99 are collective pinning radial and longitudinal correlation lengths .",
    "the correlation lengths depend on both the elasticity of the fll as well as pinning , characterized by the parameter w , and are given by ,      where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the tilt and the shear moduli of the fll , respectively , and @xmath103 is the range of interaction of the pinning force . in the lo theory ,",
    "the pinning interaction can only decrease with increasing @xmath10 , which corresponds only to a monotonic decrease in @xmath5 with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the anomalous increase in @xmath5 at the pe can be rationalized in the lo scenario only by an introduction of an anomalous sudden drop in the larkin volume @xmath95 .",

    "this picture proposes that for a sample with substantial pinning , the competition between interaction and disorder leads to some threshold behaviours .",
    "when the pinning energy overcomes the elastic energy of the fll , which is continuously softened due to increase in @xmath10 , a disorder induced transition transforms the fll from an elastic medium to a plastically deformed vortex state with a proliferation of topological defects ( dislocations ) at the onset of pe corresponding to the first jump in the ac susceptibility response ( at @xmath31)@xcite . at a higher temperature",
    ", the thermal energy overcomes the elastic energy and the pinning induced shattering transition@xcite produces a complete amorphization of the vortex solid at the peak position of the pe , which could be identified with the second jump in the diamagnetic response at @xmath7 .",
    "+ the crucial support for the stepwise fracturing of the fll comes from the thermal cycling experiments performed on a well ordered fll generated in a zfc manner ( see fig .",
    "when the temperature increases towards the pe region , the fll softens , the energy needed to create the dislocations decreases and the lattice spontaneously fractures at @xmath31 .",
    "while cooling down from a temperature within the pe pocket , i.e. , between @xmath31 and @xmath7 , the fll is cooled from a partially fractured , plastically deformed state .",

    "the system thus fails to drive out the dislocations in order to heal back to the zfc state . instead , it shatters further to release the stresses and reaches a new metastable state .",
    "this characteristic feature also yields an open hysteresis loop , i.e. , after the @xmath24 response has reached the new metastable state , it is unable to recover to the zfc like response by itself . to reach back to the zfc state from this metastable state",
    ", one needs to shake the fll vigorously by an external driving force@xcite .",
    "this characteristic hysteretic behaviour across the @xmath31 transition is definitely novel ; it is not usually seen across a typical first order ( melting ) transition in the absence of disorder .",
    "the differences between the vortex states formed during cool down from @xmath104 and those evolving during fcw mode probably originate from the slow dynamics@xcite of the order- disorder transformation across @xmath31 and @xmath7 .",
    "we believe that above @xmath7 , the fll transforms into a completely pulverized state , which is so disordered that the fll correlations beyond first few nearest neighbour inter - vortex spacings are immaterial .",
    "thus , if the fll is cooled down from such a disordered state ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) , one cools in liquid - like correlations and the fll remains in an amorphous state ( supercooled state ) down to a much lower temperature ( than that during field cooled warm up cycle ) .",
    "the above scenario leads us to infer that at @xmath31 , the fll transforms from a nearly defect - free ordered lattice , such as , a bragg glass phase @xcite to a highly defective plastically deformed lattice @xcite with full of topological defects analogous to a vortex glass phase .",
    "then at @xmath7 , the vortex glass phase further transforms into a completely amorphous but pinned phase ( @xmath106  0 ) , above which the lattice is no longer correlated and loses its history and memory .",

    "the quenched random disorder appears to pin the vortices into different configurations while preparing the fll via different routes in the ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) plane and this results in the history dependence in the screening responses of the fll .",
