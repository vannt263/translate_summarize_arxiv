    "after decades of concerted effort applied to understanding the formation processes that gave birth to our solar system , until recently , the detailed morphology of circumstellar material that must eventually form planets has been virtually impossible to discern .",
    "the advent of high contrast coronagraphic imaging , as implemented with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) instruments , has dramatically enhanced our understanding of planetary system formation .",

    ", we are conducting a nicmos coronagraphic imaging survey of 26 ( typically @xmath4 10@xmath6 yr ) main sequence stars with strong thermal - ir excesses ( indicative of circumstellar dust ) to provide a larger ensemble of spatially resolved and photometrically reliable high resolution images of debris disks , and to probe these posited epochs of planetary system formation and evolution .",
    "our images shed light on the spatial distribution of the dust in disk systems , revealing disk structures as close as 03 from their central stars . here ,",

    "the combined calibrated images were post - processed to remove well understood image / readout artifacts and those that arise in the presence of deeply exposed targets , e.g. , ( sch02 ,  8 ; sch01 ,  3 ; schneider et al .",

    "the subtractions using hd  142666 and hd  36112 , which are anomalously red for a stars , produced zonal under- and over - subtractions at different radii , indicative of target : reference psf differences from mis - matched seds .",

    "in the cases of hr  4796a and hd  141569a the presence of their m - star companions may explain the outer `` truncation '' of their disks ( e.g. , see clampin et al .",
    "2003 ) . the explanations for more complex asymmetries may rest in disk / planet dynamics .",
    "evidence for planets in previously imaged debris systems , and possibly also in hd  141569a , has been offered given the asymmetries in their disks .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries could be explained by the presence of undetected planets altering an otherwise azimuthally symmetric dust density distribution by gravitational perturbations ( e.g. , ozernoy et al .",
    "such a mechanism might also be responsible for the sb asymmetries in hd  32297 s disk .",
    "while still represented by a very small sample , the occurrence ( and diversity ) of azimuthal asymmetries in the circumstellar disks of a - stars seems to be the rule rather than the exception .",
    "we have imaged a circumstellar disk about hd 32297 in 1.1  @xmath0 m light . the disk , inclined 105 @xmath1 25 from edge - on with a major axis pa = 2365 @xmath1 1@xmath3 , extends at least 33 ( 400 au ) from the star .",
    "we estimate the 1.1  @xmath0 m disk flux density beyond the 03 radius region obscured by the coronagraph to be 4.81 @xmath1 0.57 mjy , leading to a 1.1  @xmath0 m disk scattering fraction of 0.0033 @xmath1 0.0004 .",
    "we find evidence for hemispheric radial brightness asymmetries in the disk that might be attributed to an azimuthally anisotropic distribution of the disk grains , possibly due to the influence of planetary dynamics .",
