    "we present in the one - dimensional case and in the euclidean space @xmath0 random motions at finite velocity whose distributions are obtained as solutions of cauchy problems for the epd equation . + in order to catch the flavor of what is going on in this work , we consider the symmetric telegraph process @xmath10 performed at velocity @xmath11 and with reversals of the direction of motion timed by the non - homogeneous poisson process of rate @xmath4 .",

    "+ moreover , we notice that , for @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 which coincides with the arcsine law . + in section 2 we present solutions to the epd equation ( including the non - homogeneous one examined in theorem 2.1 ) with different initial conditions and provide probabilistic representations of the results .    for the @xmath26-dimensional epd @xmath27",
    "we show that the fundamental solution coincides with the following probability density @xmath28    for @xmath8 , the distribution coincides with and thus can be regarded as its multidimensional extension .",
    "furthermore , the one - dimensional marginals of have the form with @xmath29 and therefore can be associated with a random flight whose projection on the line behaves as a telegraph process with velocity reversals governed by the non - homogeneous poisson process with rate @xmath30 .    for special values of @xmath31 ,",
    "the distribution coincides with the conditional distributions of random flights with dirichlet displacements treated in @xcite .",
    "the projection of random flights on lower dimensional spaces can be described as random motions with random velocity .",
    "we devote section 4.1 to the analysis of planar random flights with random velocities ( in the one - dimensional case stadje and zacks in @xcite have investigated this type of telegraph processes ) .",
    "furthermore for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , the probability law emerges from the fractional extension of the planar random motions with an infinite number of directions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "telegraph equations related to the one - dimensional telegraph process with a non - homogeneous poisson process have been considered in the cases where @xmath35 by iacus in @xcite and here for @xmath36 .",
    "these two cases substantially differ because for @xmath37 the random motion has only probability density in @xmath38 while in the iacus model , the process has a discrete component at @xmath23 as in the classical telegraph process . in section 3",
    "we prove also that the law of the classical telegraph process is a suitable combination of these telegraph processes with time - varying rates .",
    "section 5 is devoted to planar random motions with four orthogonal directions of motion where changes of direction are governed by a non - homogeneous poisson process with rate @xmath2 .",
    "we are able to derive the general equation governing the distribution of the position @xmath39 which coincides with the fourth - order p.d.e",
    ". obtained in @xcite when @xmath40 in this case the distribution of @xmath39 has the following representation ( see @xcite ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are independent telegraph processes with parameters @xmath44 and velocity @xmath45 . in principle , we can use the scheme in constructing planar random motions by using the one - dimensional processes related to the epd equation studied in this paper .",
    "this , however , leads to different governing equations .",
    "a random motion @xmath10 , @xmath46 , with rightward and backward velocity equal to @xmath47 , respectively , where changes of direction are paced by a non - homogeneous poisson process , denoted by @xmath48 , with time - dependent rate @xmath2 , @xmath46 , has distribution @xmath12 satisfying the cauchy problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath49 the joint distributions @xmath50 satisfy , instead , the second - order difference - differential equations with time - varying coefficients @xmath51 under the initial conditions @xmath52 provided that the initial velocity is symmetrically distributed . for @xmath53 , equation coincides with equation eq.(2.8 ) in @xcite . + for @xmath54 , equation reduces to the epd equation .",
    "the physical meaning of this epd - type equation in the framework of heat waves studies has been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is well - known ( see @xcite and @xcite , section 41 ) that the erdlyi - kober fractional integral of the dalembert solution of the wave equation is given by equation and solves the cauchy problem for the epd equation @xmath55    the first probabilistic derivation of this interesting relation was given by rosencrans in @xcite .",

    "the reason for which integrates to one , and thus the telegraph process considered here has no singular component , depends from the form of the poisson rate which hinders the particle to reach the boundaries @xmath23 because the direction initially changes infinitely often .",
    "the probability density for @xmath64 has an arcsine law structure ( and thus for @xmath65 tends to infinite ) , while for @xmath66 has a bell - shaped form . in the latter case",
    "this means that the moving particle oscillates around the origin",
    ".    for @xmath67 formula corresponds to a uniform law in @xmath38 .",
    "a special case is that of @xmath68 where the normalizing factor does not depend on time .",
    "we finally observe that @xmath69    we now arrive at the non - homogeneous epd equation and explore its connection with the forced wave equation through the erdlyi - kober integrals ( see formula below ) .",
