    "recently , much attention has been paid to brain rhythms in health and diseases @xcite .",
    "these brain rhythms emerge via synchronization between individual firings in neural circuits .",
    "this kind of neural synchronization may be used for efficient sensory and cognitive processing such as sensory perception , multisensory integration , selective attention , and memory formation @xcite , and it is also correlated with pathological rhythms associated with neural diseases ( e.g. , epileptic seizures and tremors in the parkinson s disease ) @xcite .",
    "the brain receives natural sensory stimulation , and experimental electrical or magnetic stimulation in the neural system is used for analyzing the dynamical interactions between different brain areas .",
    "responses to these external stimuli can provide crucial information about its dynamical properties .",
    "for example , the effects of periodic stimuli on rhythmic biological activity were experimentally studied by applying rhythmic visual stimulus @xcite and periodic auditory stimulation @xcite .",
    "hence , it is of great importance to investigate how an external stimulus affects the neural synchronization in the brain .",
    "techniques for controlling population synchronization have been proposed , which enables us to suppress or to enhance it . for examples ,",
    "one technique is the external time - periodic stimulation @xcite , and the other one is the time - delayed feedback in the mean field @xcite .",
    "synchronization suppression may be effective in suppressing pathological brain rhythms , while synchronization enhancement might be useful for the cases of failures of cardiac or neural pacemakers .",
    "particularly , deep brain stimulation techniques have been used to suppress pathological rhythms in patients with neural diseases such as parkinson s disease , essential tremor , and epilepsy @xcite . for this technique",
    ", micro - electrodes are implanted in deep brain regions of patients , and then time - periodic electric signal or time - delayed feedback signals are injected for suppression of abnormal rhythms .",
    "most of previous theoretical and computational works on control of population synchronization were focused on the case of excitatory - type couplings @xcite . to study how dynamical responses to external stimuli depend on the synaptic type ( excitatory or inhibitory ) , we consider two types of excitatory and inhibitory full synchronization [ i.e. , full synchronization ( where all neurons fire in each global cycle of population rhythm ) via excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions ] in complex small - world networks of excitatory regular spiking ( rs ) pyramidal neurons and inhibitory fast spiking ( fs ) interneurons .",
    "we apply external time - periodic stimuli @xmath0 @xmath4 $ ] to a fraction of neurons for both cases of excitatory and inhibitory synchronization , and investigate their dynamical responses to @xmath0 by changing the driving amplitude @xmath1 for a fixed driving angular frequency @xmath5 . for describing collective behaviors in the whole population , we use an instantaneous whole - population spike rate ( iwpsr )",

    "we characterize dynamical responses to @xmath0 in terms of a dynamical response factor @xmath2 ( given by the square root of the ratio of the variance of @xmath6 in the presence and absence of stimulus ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is larger than 1 , then synchronization enhancement occurs ; otherwise ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , synchronization suppression takes place . for both cases of excitatory and inhibitory couplings , stimulated neurons are phase - locked to external stimuli @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the stimulation effect on non - stimulated neurons varies depending on the synaptic - coupling type . for the excitatory case ,",
    "non - stimulated rs neurons are also phase - locked to external stimulus @xmath0 thanks to a constructive effect of @xmath0 ( resulting from phase - attractive synaptic excitation ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the inhibitory case the original full synchronization in the non - stimulated sub - population breaks up gradually with increasing @xmath1 due to a destructive effect of @xmath0 ( coming from strong synaptic inhibition ) , and then a new type of sparse synchronization ( where only some fraction of neurons fire in each global cycle of population rhythm ) appears . as results of these different effects of @xmath0 ,",
    "the type and degree of dynamical response ( characterized by @xmath2 ) vary differently , depending on the type of synaptic interaction . for further analysis of dynamical response",
    ", we also decompose the whole population into two sub - populations of the stimulated and the non - stimulated neurons .",
    "then , two instantaneous sub - population spike rates ( ispsrs ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 [ the superscript 1 ( 2 ) corresponds to the stimulated ( non - stimulated ) case ] may be used to show collective behaviors in the two sub - populations of stimulated and non - stimulated neurons , respectively , and the matching degree between the dynamics of the stimulated and the non - stimulated sub - populations is measured in terms of a `` cross - correlation '' measure @xmath3 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "furthermore , in the inhibitory case we have also studied the effect of coupling strength @xmath69 on the dynamical responses by considering both the small- and the large - coupling cases ( i.e. , @xmath200 and 1000 ) .",
    "thus , dynamical response has been found to vary in a quantitatively different way , depending on the coupling strength @xmath69 . for intermediate values of @xmath1",
    "stimulated fs interneurons in the case of @xmath202 have been found to exhibit intermittent and stochastic mixed burstings and spikings due to strong stochastic synaptic inputs from non - stimulated fs interneurons , in contrast to the case of @xmath200 where they show only regular burstings . as a result , the dynamical factor @xmath115 decreases rapidly in comparison with the case of @xmath200 .",
    "however , after passing its minimum , @xmath115 increases faster than that for @xmath200 , and eventually when passing an intermediate threshold it becomes larger , thanks to much more enhanced external phase lockings of burstings of stimulated fs interneurons ( resulting from both stronger external stimulation and weaker synaptic inputs from non - stimulated fs interneurons ) .",
