    "the generation of coherent light at frequencies which are not easily reachable by lasers , and resonant but almost lossless soliton - like light pulse propagation in a semiconductor are remarkable and useful optical phenomena .",
    "it has been recently shown  @xcite that the first effect can be , in particular , realized by using the modulational instability  @xcite ( mi ) of a long light pulse ( continuous wave ) propagating in a semiconductor and resulting in the parametric growth of equidistant spectral sidebands .",
    "the second effect , the so - called self - induced transmission ( sitm ) ,  @xcite has been demonstrated both numerically and experimentally for short intense light pulses .",
    "@xcite both of these effects originate from the exchange coulomb exciton - exciton interaction , which results in the nonlinear interplay of a semiconducting medium with a light pulse spectrally centered near the excitonic resonance .    like most of the nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductors ,",
    "the mentioned effects can be theoretically investigated by using the microscopic semiconductor bloch equations ( sbes ) ,  @xcite which however are rather complicated for both an analytical and numerical treatment , and require large computational facilities , being based on a many - body formalism . to obtain any relatively simple analytical results either the limiting behavior of sbes  @xcite or approximate but macroscopic models of these equations  @xcite have to be considered .",
    "one of such macroscopic models , the so - called j - model , was proposed in refs .  , where it was demonstrated that the model sufficiently well reproduced results obtained by numerical solution of the full set of microscopic sbes for a certain range of incident light pulse intensities . here",
    "we apply this model to study the mentioned optical effects .",
    "unlike previous work ,  @xcite where we have investigated mi and solitary waves formation in semiconductors by using just a single nonlinear equation for the semiconductor polarization , the present formalism describes also the dynamics of electron - hole density ( or equivalently , of the so - called inversion ) in a semiconductor and thus does not have the restrictions ( i.e. weak excitation condition ) of the model of ref .  .",
    "the structure of the present work is as follows .",
    "on the basis of a macroscopic analogue of sbes developed within the j - model and coupled to maxwell s equations for the electro - magnetic field of the incident pulse , we derive the system of governing equations ( sec .  [ s2 ] ) .",
    "then we use this system to analyze the stability of a long light pulse with regard to small perturbations . as a result",
    "we have found a strong mi of the pulse spectrum with a very large gain .",
    "all the results were also confirmed by a direct numerical simulation of the system of governing equations without additional approximations ( sec .",
    "[ s3 ] ) . to demonstrate the validity of the used model we have also applied it to describe the well studied sitm effect .",
    "@xcite after performing the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea )  @xcite both the analysis of the governing equations and their numerical simulations revealed a good agreement with known theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite results ( sec .  [ s4 ] ) .",
    "cdse was selected as a representative material in this work because it was a semiconductor utilized in known experiments on sitm .",
    "it has been demonstrated in refs .   that in the coherent regime , and for certain conditions , the complete system of microscopic sbes  @xcite can be sufficiently well approximated by a set of equations for macroscopic variables that are much more suitable for an analytical treatment .",
    "such macroscopic variables are the dimensionless complex envelope @xmath0 of the polarization field @xmath1+{\\mathrm{c.c.}}\\right\\}/2 $ ] and the dimensionless inversion @xmath2 of a semiconductor , where @xmath3 is the normalized electron - hole density ( @xmath4 $ ] ) .",
    "@xcite here it is assumed that light is either guided or polarized , and @xmath5 is the longitudinal coordinate . in complex form",

    "@xmath14 is a phenomenological model parameter , which originates from the exchange ( renormalization ) terms of sbes . in the low excitation regime ,",
    "in which @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the 1s - exciton binding frequency ) , @xmath14 was obtained on a microscopic level and was defined in ref .  .",
    "within the unscreened jellium model one finds @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the use of this definition of @xmath14 in system   is well justified , at least , for the low excitation regime .",
    "@xcite this is the so - called j - model and it has been shown  @xcite that it reproduces results obtained by numerical solution of the full system of microscopic sbes in the range of incident pulse intensities , which corresponds to the condition @xmath18 .",
    "a system similar to set   was also obtained from sbes in ref .  .",
    "however , here we prefer to use the formalism of the j - model , in which , unlike ref .",
    ", the electric field is considered separately from the exchange ( renormalization ) terms of sbes , which in their turn are included in the model parameter .",
    "@xcite    system   is more general than the nonlinear equation for the macroscopic polarization field previously used in ref .   to investigate nonlinear optical properties of semiconductors .",
    "set   can be reduced to the previous case without inversion  @xcite in the low excitation regime under the well - known approximation @xmath19 . for @xmath20 set",

    "there are only two real solutions - a negative and a positive one , and they correspond to a semiconductor , which was relatively weakly or strongly excited before the incident pulse arrival .",
