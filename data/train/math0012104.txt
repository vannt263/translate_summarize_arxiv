    "the number of steps for these homotopy algorithms was bounded in terms of a condition number and the bzout number .",
    "one of the main features of that theory was unitary invariance : the roots of a dense system of polynomial equations are points in projective space , and all the invariants of the theory are invariant under the action of the unitary group .",

    ", we give the one - distribution of the roots of random sparse polynomial systems .",
    "we also bound the probability that the condition number of a random sparse polynomial system is large .",
    "the roots of a sparse polynomial system are known to belong to a certain toric variety . however , in order to obtain the theorems below , we needed to endow the toric variety with a certain geometrical structure , as explained below .",

    "we will refer to these randomly generated functions as _ random normal polynomials _ , for short .",
    "we will also produce several objects associated to the matrix @xmath6 ( and to the variance matrix @xmath16 ) .",

    "we extend the famous result by bernshtein  @xcite on the number of roots of mixed systems of polynomials as follows :    [ gen - bernshtein ] let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be as above . for each @xmath42 ,",

    "since the evaluation function is homogeneous in each coordinate , it makes sense to projectivize each of the coordinate spaces @xmath74 ( with respect to the inner product @xmath75 ) .",

    "roughly speaking , delzant s condition is an assertion about the angle cones of the minkowski sum of the @xmath600 .",
    "the objective of this section is to clarify the analogy between the geometry of polynomial roots and hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "the key for that analogy was the existance of a _ momentum map _ associated to convex sets .    in the case",
    "the convex set is the support of a polynomial , that _ momentum map _ is also the momentum map associated to a certain lie group action , namely the natural action of the @xmath25-torus on the _ toric _ manifold @xmath51 :    the @xmath25-torus @xmath601 acts on @xmath38 by @xmath602 where @xmath603 .",

    "a lie group action with such an expression for the hamiltonian is called _ hamiltonian _ or _",
    "strongly hamiltonian_.    the theorem of atiyah ,",
    "guillemin and sternberg asserts that under certain conditions , the image of the momentum map is the convex hull of the points @xmath199 .",
    "one of those conditions requires that the action should take place in a compact symplectic manifold ( as in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) or  ( * ? ? ?",

    "we may consider a compactification of @xmath38 , such as the closure of @xmath617 .",
    "unfortunately , there are situations where this compactification is not a symplectic manifold , because the form @xmath28 vanishes in the preimage of one or more @xmath199 s ( thus differing from the assumptions of @xcite ) .    in  @xcite , a necessary and sufficient condition for the compactification of @xmath38 to be a symplectic manifold is given .",
    "namely , the polytope @xmath8 should be simple ( i.e. , every vertex should be incident to exactly @xmath25 edges ) and unimodular ( the integer points along the rays generated by each such @xmath25-tuple of edges should span @xmath618 as a @xmath619-module ) . if all the polytopes @xmath620 satisfy delzant s condition then we can construct a corresponding compactifaction @xmath51 and apply atiyah - guillemin - sternberg s theorem .",
    "another possibility is to blow - up the singularities , as explained in  @xcite .",
    "if we do so , polytopes @xmath40 will be `` shaved : '' locally , the cone emanating from a vertex will be truncated by the intersection with a half - space with boundary infinitesimally close to a supporting hyperplane . from another point of view , the underlying normal fan  @xcite will be refined .",
    "however , the relation between the original polynomial system and the new momentum map is not yet clear .",
    "this is an attempt to give a short proof of the coarea formula , in a version suitable to the setting of this paper .",
