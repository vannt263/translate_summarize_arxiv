    "magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semi - detached , interacting binaries consisting of a late - type star that overflows its roche - lobe and a white dwarf with a magnetic field sufficiently strong to influence the accretion of matter originating from the late - type companion .",
    "the magnetic field directs the accretion flow away from the orbital plane and onto both of the white dwarf s magnetic poles .",
    "accretion behaves differently in the two classes of magnetic cataclysmic variables . in polars",
    "the stars are tidally locked ; this `` static '' orientation results in an accreting flow from the lagrangian point l1 of the binary along the magnetic field lines of the white dwarf onto its magnetic pole(s ) . in intermediate polars ( ips ) ,",
    "where the white dwarf is spinning faster than the orbital period , matter also accretes onto the white dwarf along the magnetic field lines ; however , the matter first accumulates in an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf . in both polars and ips",
    "the accreting matter approaches the poles of the white dwarf supersonically and so passes through a stand - off shock before cooling and settling onto the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the cataclysmic variable ex  hydrae  belongs to the ip class .",
    "it consists of a white dwarf with a spin period of 67 minutes and has an orbital period of 98 minutes .",
    "both the spin period and binary period can be identified in its light curves , from optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , the inclination of the ex  hya  system is such that its light curve shows a partial eclipse of the lower accretion pole of the white dwarf by the companion @xcite .",
    "optical and uv spectroscopy of the ex  hya  system has detected the orbital motion associated with the white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this motion , combined with the orbital velocity of the companion and the presence of the eclipse , allows for a mass determination of the white dwarf independent of models of the accretion column . in this letter",
    "we use _ chandra _ high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) data for ex  hyaand show that its orbital motion can be detected with high resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "ex  hya  was observed by _",
    "chandra _ using the hetg in combination with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer in its spectroscopy layout ( acis - s ) on 2000 may 18 for 60 ks .",
    "the observation was continuous and covers @xmath010 orbital revolutions of the binary system and @xmath015 white dwarf revolutions .",
    "we reduced the data using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package making only two departures from the standard reduction : 1 ) we turned randomization off ( i.e. , we set rand_pix_size = 0.0 in the tg_resolve_events tool ) to minimize any artificial line broadening , and 2 ) we applied a solar system barycentric correction so that the event times are in barycentric dynamical time instead of spacecraft time .",
    "the reduced hetg ex  hya  spectrum , as shown in figure  1 ( see also @xcite ) , reveals emission lines from h- and he - like ions , as well as from fe l - shell ions , superimposed on a weak continuum . and",
    "density diagnostics reported by @xcite indicate densities of order @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "to search for velocity signatures in the ex  hya  hetg data we used the following procedure : 1 ) identify the spectral lines in the first - order high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) spectra ; 2 ) divide the observation into time segments ; 3 ) add the spectral lines in each time segment to form a composite line profile ( clp ) for each grating arm in order to boost the signal - to - noise ratio ; 4 ) measure the line centroid of the clp ; and 5 ) look for variations of the line centroid with orbital or white dwarf spin phase .",
    "table  [ table_lines ] lists the isolated spectral lines , i.e. , lines that do not have another strong line within two times the instrumental fwhm , with a signal - to - noise ratio larger than 10 .",
    "we obtained the reference wavelengths for these lines from the astrophysical plasma emission database ( aped ; * ? ? ?",
    "reference wavelengths with uncertainty estimates from aped are taken from quantum electrodynamic theory for h - like ions @xcite and he - like ions @xcite and from laboratory measurements for fe l - shell lines @xcite .",
    "wavelength uncertainties are for individual lines only and do not include the effects of dielectronic satellite lines that are associated with many of these strong lines .",
    "such blending satellite lines contribute less than a few percent to the strength of the emission feature .",
    "we defined unblended lines as either single lines or multiplets that are unresolved and from the same ion .",
    "for unresolved lines from the same ion we used the emissivity - weighted wavelengths .",
    "the he - like mg and si forbidden and intercombination lines are unresolved by meg , and since their theoretical line flux ratios depend on electron density and photoexciting radiation , we can not weight their wavelengths by the low - density emissivities tabulated in aped .",
    "thus we excluded theses lines from the clp .    to confidently add spectral lines it is important to verify the wavelength calibration and to correct for any systematic offsets between the observed line centroids and the reference wavelengths from the aped database . to fit the emission lines we first determined the contribution of the continuum emission to the spectrum .",
    "a global fit to line - free regions of heg and meg spectra using the astrophysical plasma emission code model ( apec , version 1.3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows a self - consistent treatment of the continuum for all lines .",
    "we defined the line - free regions as any part of the spectrum greater that 0.1    in width that is devoid of spectral lines with emissivities larger than @xmath5 ph  @xmath6  s@xmath7 ( this is @xmath01/1000 of brightest line in the spectrum ) in the aped database .",
    "we found a good fit for a thermal continuum ( consisting of bremsstrahlung , radiative recombination , and two - photon emission ) for a temperature of 16@xmath11 kev ( see figure  [ figure_spectrum ] ) , in good agreement with the shock temperature of @xmath8 kev reported by @xcite for an @xcite model fitted to the _ asca _ spectrum of ex  hya , and the maximum temperature of 20 kev reported by @xcite for a cooling flow model fitted to the same _ chandra _ hetg data .",
    "a two - temperature continuum model did not significantly lower the @xmath9 of the fit .",
    "this is not surprising since the highest temperatures dominate the emission measure distribution in an accretion column cooling mainly by means of thermal bremsstrahlung .    to determine if any offsets between the observed wavelengths and their reference values exist we performed the following fit .",
    "we set the distances between each consecutive pair of emission lines equal to their separation based on the aped database and only fit the normalization of each line and the overall wavelength offset .",
    "each line is modeled using a gaussian with a fwhm equal to the instrumental fwhm ( 0.012   for heg and 0.023   for meg ) .",
    "this resulted in the following offsets for each of the orders ( predicted @xmath10 observed wavelength ) : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14   for heg@xmath15 , heg@xmath16 , meg@xmath15 , and meg@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "although the offsets are small , they do constitute @xmath010% of the heg fwhm and @xmath05% of the meg fwhm , or about 3050  ( at 10  ) , and need to be corrected for .",
    "even more important than the absolute and relative wavelength calibration is its stability during an observation ; this appears to be extremly stable ( _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide ) .",
    "furthermore , the rotation and orbital periods of the ex hya system are not relevant timescales for the satellite ( dither period is 707.1 sec in the pitch direction and 1000 sec in the yaw direction ) .      to look for changing velocities associated with the binary period in the _ chandra _ hetg data for ex  hya  we first phase folded the spectra ( using the ephemeris of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and divided the observation into phase intervals centered at @xmath17 . with a width of @xmath18 , where  indicates the phase in the binary orbit .",
    "note that the phase intervals are overlapping .",
    "unfortunately , by splitting the observation into smaller phase intervals none of the spectral lines have sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to confidently measure changes in their wavelengths .",
    "we therefore added all lines in each interval to accumulate enough counts to accurately measure the central wavelength .",
    "we accomplished this by the following procedure : 1 ) for each grating first - order arm we determined the count - weighted average wavelength of the lines in table  [ table_lines ] , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of counts in the spectrum for a segment 2@xmath21fwhm wide centered on @xmath22 ( from table  [ table_lines ] ) minus the number of counts predicted by the model continuum ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "2 ) each line in the spectrum was shifted by an amount equal to its reference wavelength , @xmath23 and by the wavelength calibration correction ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "3 ) the wavelength - binned shifted spectrum was then transformed to a velocity - binned spectrum according to @xmath24 .",
    "4 ) the shifted velocity - binned profile for each spectral line was added to form one line profile . however , since the bin size for each line was different we chose to rebin each @xmath25 to the bin size corresponding to @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "5 ) finally , we measured the central velocity for this composite line profile ( clp ) .",
    "figure  [ figure_profiles ] shows the clps for binary phases  = 0.00 , 0.25 , 0.50 , and 0.75 . the change in clp centroid is clearly visible showing how powerful the combination of a large effective area and high spectral resolution can be in the x - ray regime .",
    "the radial velocity shifts as a function of  for the combined orders meg@xmath15 plus meg@xmath16 are shown in the top panel of figure  [ figure_velocity ] .",
    "we present the meg data rather than the heg data because they have a factor of 210 times more counts per spectral line , which improves our centroiding accuracy even with the lower resolution of the meg instrument ( see also  5 ) .",
    "results from the heg and the individual meg orders are consistent but with lower significance .",
    "the figure clearly shows that there is a systematic motion of the clp with a period equal to that of the binary .",
    "the solid line represents the following fit to the data points : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the velocity amplitude , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is fixed to 1.0 , and @xmath33 . since the data points overlap , and are thus correlated , we calculated @xmath9 for each of the five sets of independent data points ( indicated in figure  [ figure_velocity ] ) .",
    "the @xmath9 per degree of freedom ( dof ) for the independent data sets range from @xmath34 = 0.1 to 1.0 .",
    "it is important to note that the value of @xmath9 for a small number of dof can be different from the value one expects to indicate a good fit in the case of a large number of dof , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the important statistic is @xmath36 , which is the probability that the observed chi - squared will exceed the value @xmath9 . acceptable values for @xmath37 , i.e. , the 3@xmath38 confidence interval , range from @xmath00.0015 to @xmath00.9985 . for the above values of @xmath9/dof",
    ", @xmath37 ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 .",
    "we also fitted the data with 1 ) a constant velocity and 2 ) a sine curve with the period not forced to the binary phase , i.e. , @xmath32 not fixed to 1.0 in eq .",
    "[ eq_velocity ] .",
    "the former fit yields @xmath39 , @xmath40 ranges from 13 to 19 , and @xmath41 , while the latter fit yields a period of @xmath42 times the binary period , and values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are indistinguishable from the fit described above .",
    "the latter fit has zero degrees of freedom and hence a meaningless @xmath9 .",
    "the above velocity amplitude and phase offset , @xmath30 , and @xmath46 are in good agreement with those reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* @xmath55 , @xmath56 , using fuv lines ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath57 , @xmath58 , using uv lines ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ figure_velocity ] shows the clp radial velocity versus the white dwarf spin period using bins of size one - third the spin period ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the velocities have been corrected for the average binary motion for each data point based on the fit described in  3.2 . to provide upper limits on the rotation velocity of the white dwarf and the infall velocities in the accretion column , we fitted sine curves to these data .",
    "we assumed that the upper accretion column is pointing away from the observer at white dwarf phase 0 ( consistent with both the accretion curtain model [ @xcite ] and the accretion pole occultation model [ @xcite ] ) and that the cooler part of the lower accretion column , where most of the spectral lines are formed , is not visible throughout most of the spin cycle @xcite .",
    "the dotted curve in the figure represents the best - fit rotation velocity of @xmath60  ( @xmath61 ) and the dashed curve represents the best - fit infall velocity of @xmath62  ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the 3@xmath38 upper limits on the rotation and infall velocities are thus @xmath025  .",
    "combining the orbital motion of the white dwarf obtained in  3.2 with the orbital motion of the companion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath64 ) and the eclipse duration @xcite allows us to determine the white dwarf mass @xmath65 , companion mass @xmath66 , and inclination @xmath67 of the ex  hya  system .",
    "here we followed the approach taken by @xcite using a computer program kindly provided to us by k.  beuermann . assuming that the emission originates at or near the pole of the white dwarf , the iterative method yields @xmath68 @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath69 , @xmath71 .",
    "the white dwarf mass @xmath65 corresponds to a white dwarf radius @xmath72  cm @xcite . if the emission originates above the surface of the white dwarf the inclination of the system decreases @xmath73 for every @xmath74 in elevation above the surface .",
    "these results agree within the errors with those found by @xcite and hence do not change any of the conclusions reached in that paper .    finally , we note that our estimate of the white dwarf mass , which is based on the radial velocity of the emission lines in the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum , agrees with that of @xcite ( @xmath75 ) , which is based on the h- to he - like emission line intensity ratios observed in the _ asca _ spectrum .",
    "our `` classical '' radial velocity result is applicable only to high - inclination magnetic cv binaries , whereas theirs is applicable to a wide range of polars and ips , although it relies on theoretical models of accretion column .",
    "our radial velocity measurement in ex  hya  pushes the instrumental limit of the _ chandra _ grating instruments .",
    "the meg instrument has an effective area large enough to accumulate between 3000 and 4000 counts in the clp so that we can reliably find the centroid to an accuracy of @xmath00.5  m , corresponding to an accuracy in velocity space of 1015  ( at @xmath010   ) .",
    "this is consistent with the statistical uncertainty for measuring gaussian line centroids derived by @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the statistical uncertainty in @xmath78 ( the line center ) , @xmath38 is the instrumental resolution ( fwhm/2.3548 ) , @xmath79 is the bin size expressed in terms of @xmath38 , and @xmath80 is the average error expressed in terms of the peak amplitude . for our meg clp",
    "this equation yields 0.5  m , as observed , where we have taken @xmath81 , with @xmath82 the number of counts in the peak bin of the clp .",
    "unfortunately the effective area of the heg instrument is significantly smaller ( a factor of 3 at 10   ) and does not allow us to improve over the meg despite the better instrumental resolution ( @xmath83  mfor heg , similar to meg ) .",
    "this means that for this ex  hyadata set we obtain similar velocity accuracies for heg and meg . to fully exploit the heg resolution , i.e. , gain a factor of 2 in velocity accuracy , a significantly longer observation would be required .",
    "more velocity resolution is desirable to detect velocity changes induced by the rotation of the white dwarf around it spin axis .",
    "such velocity signatures would provide information on the location and velocity of the emitting plasma and on the location of the magnetic pole .",
    "the lack of a pronounced velocity variation at the spin period of the white dwarf in this hetg observation is expected . to see this , note that the free - fall velocity onto the white dwarf @xmath84 , and the immediate post - shock velocity @xmath85 .",
    "also note that the majority of the spectral lines in the hetg spectrum are formed at temperatures of less than 2  kev , i.e. , 0.1 times the post - shock temperature @xmath86 kev ( @xmath87 is the mean molecular weight of a completely ionized plasma of solar composition ) . from figures  1 and 2 of @xcite we estimate the velocity of the 2  kev gas to be @xmath88 .",
    "assuming that the accretion columns are perpendicular to the orbital plane , the projected post - shock velocity @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , the maximum rotational velocity of the white dwarf @xmath90 .",
    "both velocities are smaller than the upper limits derived in  3.3 .",
    "we have confirmed the orbital velocity of the white dwarf in the cataclysmic variable ex  hya  using the _ chandra _ hetg .",
    "this measurement is the first detection of orbital motion in a cv binary system based on x - ray spectroscopy . by adding various spectral lines visible in the ex  hya  spectrum enough signal - to - noise ratio can be accumulated to obtain velocities accurate to 1015 .",
    "no new conclusions are drawn on the white dwarf mass ( 0.49@xmath10.13 @xmath91 ) .",
