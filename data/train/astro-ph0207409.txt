    "attention is now being directed to the possible systematic errors involved in using these objects as high redshift distance indicators .",
    "part of the challenge lies in untangling the dispersion of sne  ia lightcurve widths from possible sub - populations of type ia supernovae . with more discoveries of nearby supernovae in various host environments , and the development of new spectroscopic and photometric techniques for isolating these sub - populations , we may soon be able to determine @xmath7 and @xmath8 with lower systematic uncertainties as well as hone in on the progenitors of sne  ia .    over the past three years",

    "the bluer @xmath54 and @xmath55 evolution were caused by the delay in the appearance of the second lightcurve maximum , which was more clearly seen in redder passbands ( see figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) , and therefore is accentuated in the @xmath54 and @xmath55 curves .",
    "sn  1999aw also appeared bluer than sn  1999aa and sn  1991 t in @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which perhaps was an effect of sn  1999aw having a much slower decline rate than both sn  1999aa and sn  1991 t .",
