    "for affinely parametrized partial differential equations , the certified reduced basis method ( rbm ) @xcite utilizes an offline - online computational decomposition strategy to produce surrogate solution ( of dimension @xmath0 ) in a time that is of orders of magnitude shorter than what is needed by the underlying numerical solver of dimension @xmath1 ( called _ truth _ solver hereafter ) .",
    "the rbm relies on a projection onto a low dimensional space spanned by truth approximations at an optimally sampled set of parameter values @xcite .",
    "this low - dimensional manifold is generated by a greedy algorithm making use of a rigorous _ a posteriori _ error bounds for the field variable and associated functional outputs of interest which also guarantees the fidelity of the surrogate solution in approximating the truth approximation .",
    "the high efficiency and accuracy of rbm render it an ideal candidate for practical methods in the real - time and many - query contexts .",
    "this crucial _ a posteriori _ error bound is residual - based and requires an estimate ( lower bound ) for the stability factor of the discrete partial differential operator , that is the coercivity or inf - sup constant . in the rbm context , given any parameter value this stability factor must be estimated efficiently .",
    "so it should also admit an offline - online structure for which the online expense is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the optimality of the low - dimensional rb manifold is dependent on the quality of this estimate as a parameter - dependent function , so the lower bound should not be too pessimistic .",
    "there are several approaches in the literature .",
    "a successive constraint method ( scm ) is proposed in @xcite and subsequently improved in @xcite .",
    "it is a framework incorporating both continuity _ and _ stability information whose online component is the resolution of a small - size liner programming ( lp ) problem .",
    "hence , this procedure is rather efficient .",
    "however , the classical inf - sup formulation has couple of undesirable attributes  a @xmath3-term affine parameter expansion ( resulting from a squaring of the operator ) , and loss of ( even local ) concavity .",
    "on the other hand , a  natural - norm \" method is proposed in @xcite .",
    "its linearized - in - parameter inf - sup formulation has several desirable approximation properties - a @xmath4-term affine parameter expansion , and first order ( in parameter ) concavity ; however , the lower bound procedure is rather crude - a framework which incorporates only continuity information . a natural - norm scm approach is proposed in @xcite combining the  linearized \" inf - sup statement with the scm lower bound procedure . the former ( natural - norm )",
    "provides a smaller optimization problem which enjoys intrinsic lower bound properties .",
    "the latter ( scm ) provides a systematic optimization framework : a linear program relaxation which readily incorporates effective stability constraints .",
    "the natural - norm scm performs very well in particular in the offline stage : it is typically an order of magnitude less costly than either the natural - norm or  classical \" scm approaches alone .",
    "however , unlike the classical scm , it provides no upper - bound thus no control of the quality of the lower bound .",
    "this often results in extremely pessimistic estimate .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a certified version of the nnscm ( cnnscm ) . without significantly degrading the efficiency",
    ", it provides an upper - bound and thus a mechanism for the user to easily control the quality of the lower bound . as a result",
    ", the lower bound of the new cnnscm may be orders of magnitude more accurate than the original nnscm .",
    "the method is tested on two elliptic partial differential equations . in",
    "what follows , we use the same notation as in @xcite and denote the classical scm method @xcite as @xmath5 in order to differentiate it from the new natural - norm type of approaches . here",
    ", the ( squared ) superscript suggests the undesired @xmath3-term affine parameter expansion in the classical method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "background ] , we review the background materials including the rbm , its _ a posteriori _ error estimation and the involved stability constant .",
    "section [ sec : lower - bound ] describes the natural - norm scm .",
    "the new certified nnscm is proposed in section [ sec : cnnscm ] .",
    "numerical validations are presented in section [ sec : numerical ] , and finally some concluding remarks are offered in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for the completeness of this paper and to put the concerned method into context , we introduce the necessary background materials in this section . to that end",
    ", this section covers the truth solver and the related stability constants , the reduced basis method , and the _ a posteriori _ error estimate needed therein .",
    "[ sec : formulation ]      we use @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) to denote a bounded physical domain with boundary @xmath8 .",
    "we introduce a closed parameter domain @xmath9 , a point ( @xmath10-tuple ) in which is denoted @xmath11 . a set of @xmath0 parameter values",
    "will be differentiated by superscripts @xmath12 .",
    "let us then define the hilbert space @xmath13 equipped with inner product @xmath14 and induced norm @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 ( @xmath17 for a scalar field and @xmath18 for a vector field ) @xcite . finally , we introduce a parametrized bilinear form and two linear forms .",
    "@xmath19 : @xmath20 is such that    * it is inf - sup stable and continuous over @xmath13 : @xmath21 and @xmath22 is finite @xmath23 , where @xmath24 * @xmath25 is  affine \" in the parameter : @xmath26 .",
    "we emphasize that it can be approximated by affine ( bi)linear forms when it is nonaffine @xcite . finally , we introduce two linear bounded functionals @xmath27 and @xmath28 that are also affine in the parameter .",
    "the following continuous problem is then well - defined .    *",
    "( @xmath29 ) * given @xmath30 , find @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .    for many applications",
    ", we concern a scalar quantify of interest as @xmath33 .",
    "to discretize this problem , we consider for an example a finite element approximation space ( of dimension @xmath34 ) @xmath35 .",
    "suppose that the discretized bilinear form remains inf - sup stable ( and continuous ) over @xmath36 with constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 being finite @xmath23 , where @xmath39 we now introduce our _ truth _ discretization :    * ( @xmath40 ) * given @xmath30 , find @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "this discretization is called _ truth _ and its solution _ truth approximation _ because our reduced basis approximation is built upon , and its error measured with respect to this finite element solution . the ( numerical ) output is evaluated accordingly @xmath43 . since we are essentially abandoning * ( @xmath29 ) * , for brevity of exposition we may omit the @xmath34 when there is no confusion .",
    "we end this section by re - writing the inf - sup constant @xmath44 . to that end",
    ", we first define the supremizing operator @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , we have @xmath47 recalling the affine assumption allows us to decompose @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the fundamental observation utilized by rbm is that @xmath52 residing on @xmath53 can typically be well approximated by a finite - dimensional space .",
    "the rbm idea is then to propose an approximation of @xmath54 by @xmath55 where , @xmath56 are @xmath0 @xmath57 truth approximations corresponding to the parameters @xmath58 selected according to a judicious sampling strategy @xcite . for a given @xmath59 , we now solve in @xmath60 for the reduced solution @xmath61 .    * ( @xmath62 ) * given @xmath30 , find @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "the online computation is @xmath2-independent , thanks to the assumption that the ( bi)linear forms are affine .",
    "hence , the online part is very efficient . in order to be able to `` optimally ''",
    "find the @xmath0 parameters and to assure the fidelity of the reduced basis solution @xmath61 to approximate the truth solution @xmath52 , we need the _ a posteriori _ error estimator @xmath65 @xcite that involves the residual @xmath66 and the inf - sup stability constant @xmath67 . with this estimator",
    ", we can describe briefly the classical greedy algorithm used to find the @xmath0 parameters @xmath68 and the space @xmath60 : we first randomly select one parameter value and compute the associated truth approximation .",
    "next , we scan the entire discrete parameter space and for each parameter in this space compute its rb approximation @xmath69 and the error estimator @xmath70 .",
    "the next parameter value we select , @xmath71 , is the one corresponding to the largest error estimator .",
    "we then compute the truth approximation and thus have a new basis set consisting of two elements .",
    "this process is repeated until the maximum of the error estimators is sufficiently small .",
    "we end by providing the missing component - how the inf - sup lower bound will serve within the error estimators . the reduced basis field error and",
    "output error ( relative to the truth discretization ) satisfies @xcite    * @xmath72 * @xmath73    here , @xmath74 refers to the dual norm with respect to @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a lower bound of @xmath67 .",
    "the later implies that the quality of the inf - sup lower bound affects the quality of the error bound which , in turn , determines the optimality of the rb space @xmath60 .",
    "how to build a high - quality @xmath77 efficiently is the topic of the next section .",
    "the nnscm @xcite constructs a decomposition of the ( global ) parameter domain @xmath78 by a greedy approach .",
    "there is a `` control point '' @xmath79 within each subdomain .",
    "locally in each subdomain , a linearized - in - parameter inf - sup formulation is utilized incorporating continuity information resulting in first order ( in parameter ) concavity . for the completeness of this paper and , in addition , due to that many ingredients of the nnscm are adopted by our new cnnscm",
    ", we detail the local and global aspects of this algorithm in the following two subsections respectively .",
    "the inf - sup numbers at the control points of these subdomains @xmath80 are calculated exactly and , at any other location , the ratio @xmath81 is approximated from below .",
    "obviously the product of this lower bound and @xmath82 provides a lower bound for @xmath83 .",
    "let us describe these two components briefly .      for a given subdomain @xmath85 with control point @xmath86 , and @xmath87",
    ", we define an inf - sup constant measured relative to a natural - norm @xcite : @xmath88 and a lower bound for @xmath89 , @xmath90 it can be easily shown that @xmath91 and that @xmath92 will be a good approximation to @xmath89 for @xmath93 near @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that @xmath94 which allows us to translate the lower bound for @xmath95 into a lower bound for @xmath44 given @xmath84 .",
    "what remains of the local approximation is the application of the classical scm@xmath97 to construct lower and upper bounds for @xmath92 .",
    "this is applicable by simply noting that @xmath98 and @xmath99    however , for the completeness of this algorithm , let us provide the details of this procedure .",
    "we first introduce the bounding box @xmath100 , \\mbox {   where   }   \\gamma_q = \\sup_{w \\in x } \\frac { \\| t_q w \\|_x } { \\| w \\|_x } , \\quad 1 \\le q \\le q    ; \\ ] ] note that the @xmath101 are independent of @xmath86 .",
    "next , given the local scm sample ( whose construction , detailed in the next section , will be done in a greedy fashion ) @xmath102 we can now define @xmath103 and then the lower bound for @xmath104 determined by @xmath105 is obtained by solving the linear programming problem @xmath106 here , @xmath107 denotes the set of @xmath108 points that are closest to @xmath109 within the set @xmath105 . to develop the upper bound",
    ", we simply introduce the set @xmath110 and then define @xmath111    we want to make two remarks at this point :    * we have @xmath112 and hence @xcite @xmath113 * the lower bound will only be useful if @xmath114 over @xmath85 which is , in general , not a consequence of @xmath115 .",
    "we must thus adaptively divide the global parameter domain @xmath116 into subdomains @xmath85 to ensure positivity .",
    "this is the subject of the next subsection .",
    "we construct our domain decomposition @xmath117 by a greedy approach .",
    "we first extend our lower and upper bounds of and to all @xmath118 : for a given @xmath119 and a finite sample @xmath120 we define @xmath121 and @xmath122 this allows us to introduce an `` scm@xmath123 quality control '' indicator .",
    "@xmath124 here , the `` r '' in `` scm@xmath123 '' indicates that it is to control the ratio between @xmath44 and @xmath84 .",
    "finally , we require a very rich train sample @xmath125 , an scm tolerance @xmath126 , and an inf - sup tolerance function @xmath127 which is usually set to zero .",

    "several remarks regarding this algorithm follow :    * the set of points @xmath153 play the role of temporary subdomains during the greedy construction .",
    "observe that we declare the current subdomain / approximation complete ( and move to the next subdomain ) _ only _ when the trial sample offers no improvement in the positivity coverage _ and _ the trial sample is not required to satisfy our @xmath154 scm quality criterion . *",
    "the improvement for a particular subdomain and identification of a new subdomain are based on different criteria . for the former",
    "@xmath155 is very effective : the @xmath156 will _ avoid _",
    "@xmath93 for which the upper bound is negative and hence likely to lie outside the domain of relevance of @xmath157 , yet _",
    "@xmath93 for which the current approximation is poor and hence ( likely ) to lie at the extremes of the domain of relevance of @xmath157 - thus promoting optimal coverage .",
    "in contrast , for the latter @xmath158 is very effective : the arg min will look for the most negative value of the lower bound - thus leaving the domain of relevance of @xmath157 .    finally , our global lower bound for @xmath44",
    "is defined to be the maximum of those translated from each subdomain : @xmath159",
    "our primary interest is in the lower bound @xmath160 as it is required for rigor in our reduced basis _ a posteriori _ error estimator .",
    "however , the upper bound serves an important role in making sure the lower bound is not too pessimistic .",
    "we note that nnscm @xcite can ensure reasonable accuracy by choosing an appropriate @xmath161 in algorithm [ alg : greedy ] .",
    "however , there are usually parameters in @xmath161 that we need to tune and there is no mechanism to easily control the true error of the lower bound for @xmath162 .    here",
    ", we develop an upper bound that can be constructed together with the natural - norm scm lower bound at marginal offline cost .",
    "to do that , we recall that for scm@xmath97 , @xmath163 to realize @xmath164 here , @xmath165 is the kronecker delta .",

    "here we introduce an additional tolerance @xmath182 which is to bound @xmath183 so that we have @xmath184    this algorithm is very similar to algorithm [ alg : greedy ] .",
    "in addition to defining the global upper bound , it incorporates the mechanism of allowing for multiple rounds of domain decomposition which is not possible for nnscm . in the context of the cnnscm , nnscm stops after the first round when the whole parameter domain is covered and , for each subdomain , the quality of the lower bound for the ratio @xmath185 has achieved the desired tolerance . on the other hand ,",
    "the cnnscm detects this , through monitoring the quality of @xmath186 measured by @xmath187 , and continue with more rounds of domain decomposition . for each @xmath188 ,",
    "it is covered by one subdomain at each round making it possible to sharpen the lower bound @xmath189 in approximating @xmath186 . moreover , to start a new round , the size of @xmath183 is a good indicator for the need of a control point .",
    "thus we set @xmath177 to set the stage for the next domain decomposition .",
    "another important remark is that the increase in computational cost due to the @xmath190term expansion in is negligible .",

    "for the nnscm , since the parameter domain @xmath116 is completely decomposed and the @xmath201-condition is met on each subdomain , it will stop after the first column . as a result ,",
    "the quality of the lower bound , measured by @xmath202 , is bad . on the other hand",
    ", the cnnscm detects this and continue with two more rounds of domain decompositions gradually improving the quality of the lower bound .",

    ", we plot the histogram of @xmath203 on the second row .",

    "the result for the second problem is shown in figure [ fig : p2result ] .",
    "the setting is the same other than that the parameter domain is discretized by a @xmath204 grid .",
