    "the _ fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fermi ) _ has onboard two instruments : the large area telescope ( lat ) , sensitive in the 100 mev  100 gev energy range ( and even beyond 100 gev , for very bright sources , atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the gamma bursts monitor ( gbm ) , especially designed for the detection of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , sensitive in the 8 kev  40 mev energy range ( meegan et al .",
    "the lat revealed 12 grbs above 100 mev confirming that grbs can be sources of very high energy photons and that the fraction of grbs that can be detected at these energies is roughly 10 per cent of those detected by the gbm at lower energies .",
    "it was the egret instrument , onboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ the first to detect grbs above 100 mev ( fishman & meegan 1995 ; kaneko et al . 2008 ) , but it is the much better sensitivity ( and reduced dead time ) of the lat to allow us for the first time to try to understand the origin of this emission and to answer the question : does it belong to the prompt phase or is it afterglow emission produced by the fireball colliding with the circum ",
    "burst medium ? or has it still another origin ?",
    "one of the puzzling features of the high energy emission as revealed by egret was that it was long lasting , yet it started during the prompt phase as seen by the burst alert and transient experiment ( batse ) onboard _ cgro _ sensitive in the 30 kev  1 mev energy band .",
    "for instance , grb 940217 emitted @xmath5 mev photons up to 1.5 hours after the prompt phase ended in the batse detector .",
    "a photon of 18 gev was received @xmath65000 s after the trigger ( hurley et al .",
    "1994 ) , and this was the highest photon energy of a grb until the lat era . on the other hand ,",
    "about a third of the high energy photons were received within 120 s , before the end of the prompt phase as detected by batse .    up to now",
    ", there have been three lat  detected grbs already discussed in the literature . in grb 080916c ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a ) , there is evidence that the spectrum from 8 kev to 10 gev can be described by the same band function ( i.e. two smoothly connected power laws ) , suggesting that the lat flux has the same origin of the low energy flux . on the other hand ,",
    "the flux level of the lat emission , its spectrum and its long lasting nature match the expectations from a forward shock , leading kumar & barniol  duran ( 2009 ) to prefer the ",
    "standard afterglow \" interpretation ( see also razzaque , dermer & finke 2009 for an hadronic model ; zhang & peer 2009 for a magnetically dominated fireball model and zou et al .",

    "we applied the radiative scenario to the 4 brightest ( in the lat ) grbs with redshift .",
    "they are the same illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , namely grb 080916c , grb 090510 , grb 090902b and grb 090926 . in principle , the number of parameters used for the adopted model is limited ( they are listed in tab . [ para ] ) , but we adopted a few rather drastic simplifications :    * we consider the fireball , when colliding with the interstellar medium , as  thin \" .",
    "in other words , we assume that it can act as a piston having a total energy @xmath7 .",
    "this is completely right for short grbs , but not for long ones .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ lc ] , the _ fermi_/lat emission of several grbs starts while the emission seen by the gbm has not ended . in this case",
    "the @xmath8 rising behaviour of the lat light curve can be different ( see sari 1997 ) . * when calculating the number of pairs produced by the circum ",
    "bursts medium , we neglect the amplification ( exponential ) effect of the produced pairs that can themselves scatter the incoming radiation . the momentum deposited in the circum ",
    "bursts medium is also taken into account only by imposing that the maximum number of pairs per proton is @xmath9 , since a larger number corresponds to a mildly relativistic motion of the medium , and the quenching off of the pair  producing mechanism for simplicity , we use the thomson cross section for scattering , and assume that most of the prompt phase photons are close to the threshold for pair production .",
    "* we assume that _ all _ electrons and positrons are accelerated .",
    "if , instead , only a fraction of them receive the entire available energy , then the typical lorentz factors of the accelerated leptons is larger .",
    "* we use a fixed value of @xmath10 , even if the number of pairs populating the circum  bursts medium decreases with @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , we use the radiative solution all throughout the shown evolution , with no transition to the adiabatic case .",
    "bearing in mind these caveats , figs .",

    "[ para ] . in the cases of grb 080916c and grb 090510",
    "we have also added a constant flux to the light curve , to account for the presence of the background , flattening off the observed light  curves . in the case of grb 090510 ,",
    "the fact that the flux above 200 s is due to the background has been confirmed by de pasquale et al .",
    "( 2009 , see their fig .",
    "1 ) . also for 080916c the points above 1000",
    "s are affected by background ( see abdo et al . 2009a , and their fig .",
    "so , for these two bursts , the flattening of the light ",
    "curve at late times should not be due to the contribution of the ssc component entering in the lat energy range ( as predicted by dermer , chiang & mitman 2000 , and tantalisingly suggested by fig .",
    "[ f080916c ] and fig .",
    "[ f090510 ] ) , but only because we did not subtract the background .",
    "the solid lines shown in all top panels refer to the luminosity integrated in the 0.1100 gev energy range , while the dashed thick lines are the bolometric fluxes ( both normalised to the prompt phase energetics of each burst ) . for comparison",
    "we show also the lines corresponding to @xmath12 and to @xmath13 .",
    "we can see that in all cases the radiative interpretation is in good agreement with what observed , and that in all cases the predicted @xmath14 is well below the 0.1 gev value .",
    "this ensures that in the lat we should see a spectral shape @xmath15 . the observed decay slope and the spectral index in the lat energy range ( see tab",
    ". 1 ) are consistent with eq .",
    "[ closure2 ] , but the errors on @xmath16 are too large to use this as a reliable test .",
    "the found bulk lorentz factors are in the range 630900 for the long bursts , and 2000 for the short grb 090510 .",
    "we believe that these relatively large values are the key to understand why only a minority of bursts are detectable by the lat . a large bulk lorentz factor , in fact , means an early peak time of the afterglow ( see eq .",
    "[ liso3 ] and eq .",
    "[ liso4 ] ) , and this in turn means a large flux . _",
    "faster fireballs have brighter afterglows_. this is true for adiabatic as well as radiative fireballs .",
    "if the emission occurs in the radiative regime then the afterglow will be brighter still , since all the energy dissipated in the external shock is radiated away .    if the circum  bursts medium is enriched by electron ",
    "positron pairs , we have a more favourable set up for a radiative process . if the acceleration mechanism divides its energy to all particles , then leptons should receive a total energy exceeding the one given to protons . but this may be only one of the means to have a radiative fireball . an alternative is to have a strong coupling between electrons and protons , with an efficient energy flow from protons to electrons . in any case , we can easily test if pairs are indeed important by simply comparing the general properties of the early afterglow for bursts of different @xmath17 and high energy index @xmath18 , since only those bursts whose prompt phase photon energies exceed @xmath19 should efficiently populate the circumburst medium by pairs . as an example , we may test if the high energy emission is present only in grbs of high @xmath17 ( in the rest frame ) as it appears to be the case until now , or if it occurs also for bursts with a small @xmath17 . if this will occur , and if the flux will decay with a slower rate than @xmath13 , then we will have an indication of a fast fireball that emits adiabatically because of no pairs  enrichment of the circum ",
    "bursts medium . in other words , a possible test of the idea of having radiative afterglows because of",
    "pair enrichment is to find a different time decay for the high energy emission in classical grbs whose prompt phase emission extends to high energies and x  ray flashes , characterised by relatively small values of @xmath17 .",
    "the radiative interpretation could ease the efficiency problem of the afterglow phase .",
    "this problem concerns the ratio of the energetics emitted during the prompt and afterglow phases , that is much larger than unity ( e.g. zhang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "according to the standard internal / external shock scenario one expects the opposite , since external shocks should be much more efficient than internal ones to dissipate the kinetic energy of the fireball .",
    "these estimates were based on the observed x ",
    "ray afterglow energetics ( see e.g. willingale et al . 2007 ; ghisellini et al . 2009 ) , and we can now revise them including the much more powerful high energy @xmath4ray emission , bringing the total afterglow energetics to be roughly equal to the prompt phase one . furthermore , if the fireball is indeed radiative in the first phases , with a consequent fast decay , we can understand why the afterglow emission at later times and at other frequencies is so faint .    according to our findings , bursts detected by the lat may be the ones with the largest @xmath3 , and can be used to explore the high  end @xmath3distribution . on the other hand , one can wonder about the possibility to detect with the lat bursts with relatively smaller @xmath3 , smaller high energy luminosities and with light curves peaking at larger peak times .",
    "even if rare , nearby objects with these properties might be still detectable , offering a direct way to test our ideas : even if they should be characterised by much lower peak luminosities in the lat , they should have lat / gbm fluence ratios similar to those presented in this paper , and lower values of @xmath3 .",
    "one of the argument put forward against the afterglow interpretation of the high energy flux is its variability , that according to abdo et al .",
    "( 2009c ) can have a timescales @xmath20 as short as 90 ms .",
    "if true , this is certainly a severe problem for the afterglow interpretation . on the other hand",
    "the knowledge of @xmath20 is limited by the few number of received photons .",
    "when the entire light  curve , lasting for a few hundreds seconds , is composed by a few hundreds events , one can define a very short @xmath20 only if there is an exceptional  bunching \" of photons in contiguous time  bins , and we do not see it in the bursts we analysed .    finally , we would like to emphasise the importance of establishing , in general , if the high and low energy emission are produced by the same electrons at the same time or instead if they are produced by different electrons at different times . as the study of grb 090510 ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2009 ) has demonstrated , we are reaching the required data quality to put strong constraints on the theories predicting the violation of the lorentz invariance at small scales , that can be tested by comparing the possible delay of the _ arrival _ times of high energy photons .",
    "the critical issue about these studies is to know exactly the _ generation _ time of the high with respect to low energy emission .",
    "therefore it becomes crucial to establish if the flux received by the lat is the extension in energy of the prompt phase emission or if it is afterglow radiation .",
