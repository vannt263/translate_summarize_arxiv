    "supersymmetric field theories have many remarkable properties . in many cases ,",

    "the holomorphy makes it possible to obtain exact information about the theory . in many different types of theories",
    ", one can compute the exact spectrum of certain particles known as bps states @xcite .",
    "probably the most famous such computation is for four - dimensional @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theories , where seiberg and witten showed how to compute the bps spectrum by exploiting the holomorphy of the superpotential and the fact that its singularity structure and monodromies can be inferred by perturbative arguments @xcite .    before the work of @xcite , a very close analog of this computation had already been done in @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite how one could derive a differential equation whose solution gives directly the exact bps mass spectrum .",
    "the computation utilizes a technique called topological - antitopological fusion , introduced in @xcite .",
    "this work was extended further in @xcite , where it was shown how to extract the bps spectrum without having to find the full solution of the differential equation . instead , the bps masses , a property of the infrared , are related directly the charges of the fields in the ramond sector at the ultraviolet conformal point .    for a variety of reasons",
    ", it seemed to us worthwhile to revisit these techniques .",
    "there has renewed interest in closely related two - dimensional theories with supersymmetry in the last few years ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable that exact non - perturbative information can be obtained in a strongly - interacting field theory , and in our opinion , the results of @xcite have not yet been fully exploited .",
    "most of the examples studied in these earlier papers were fairly well understood prior to that work .",
    "in particular , many of them correspond to integrable field theories , for which there exist a number of standard techniques for deriving exact information . by using @xmath4-matrix techniques ,",
    "the exact spectrum for many @xmath0 theories had already been found in @xcite .",
    "thus it would be useful to apply the results of @xcite to cases where the answer is not known already .",
    "moreover , even in the known cases , computing the spectrum is done indirectly  one makes an ansatz and checks its consistency by the powerful constraints of integrability .",
    "the methods of @xcite allow a direct and exact computation of the bps spectrum .",
    "the key result exploited in this paper is quite simple to understand .",
    "the bps states here form doublets under the supersymmetry , while all other states form a quartet . in @xmath0 theories , there is a @xmath5 fermion - number symmetry , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the supercharges have fermion number @xmath7 , so the particles in the bps doublet have fermion numbers @xmath8 for some number @xmath9 , while a quartet has charge @xmath10 .",
    "the quantity introduced in @xcite is a thermodynamic trace , @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 the inverse temperature and @xmath13 the hamiltonian on open space .",
    "the key property of @xmath14 is that only the bps states appear in the one - particle contributions to this trace ( the leading contributions at @xmath12 large ) .",
    "a bps doublet of mass @xmath15 results in a one - particle contribution proportional to @xmath16 to the trace .",
    "however , the quartet one - particle contribution vanishes , because @xmath17 .",
    "as we will discuss , the fermion number @xmath9 and the mass @xmath15 of the bps states are known from the superpotential .",
    "thus computing @xmath14 with a given set of boundary conditions gives the exact multiplicities of any bps states obeying these boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , it was shown how to find the large-@xmath15 behavior of @xmath14 ( and hence the multiplicities ) without having to compute the whole thing .",
    "the theories studied here correspond to superconformal minimal models perturbed by a relevant operator . in terms of a landau - ginzburg superfield @xmath18",
    ", the superpotential is @xmath19 . in this paper",
    ", we derive the exact bps spectrum of these models , and use the integrability to learn about the non - bps states . in a sequel @xcite , we will give their @xmath4-matrix .",
    "the series of models studied here is one of three sets of integrable @xmath0 theories found by deforming the superconformal minimal model into a massive field theory @xcite .",
    "the other two deformations are well understood @xcite .",
    "the theory here is more complicated , and the @xmath4-matrix approach ran aground because of technical complications @xcite .",
    "the differential equations arising from topological - antitopological fusion were found in @xcite , but their general asymptotic behavior is not known , and so the bps spectrum was not extracted .",
    "the spectrum has been guessed at @xcite , but no authoritative results were known .",
    "another reason for doing our computation is that we will find some very interesting behavior .",
    "due to the integrability , we can not only infer the masses of non - bps states , but prove that they can be produced in a scattering event involving only the bps states .",
    "in section 2 we review the main characteristics of supersymmetric solitons in two dimensions , and discuss the theories with superpotential @xmath1 .",
    "in section 3 we review the work of @xcite . in particular we discuss the index @xmath14 , and the relation between the bps spectrum and the charges of the chiral fields . the proof and further use of this relation",
    "is directly related to singularity theory : the bps spectrum is encoded in the monodromy matrix of the vanishing cycles .",
    "we recall , as needed , main results from the picard - lefschetz theory of singularities of differentiable maps @xcite .",
    "the computation for @xmath20 odd in section 4 is a straightforward application of the above relation .",
    "the computation of bps spectrum for @xmath20 even in section 5 requires additional mathematical results , from the singularity theory of functions on manifolds with boundary . in section 6",
    "we prove the existence of non - bps states in this theory , and present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review @xmath0 supersymmetric solitons in 1 + 1 dimensions , and introduce the theories studied in this paper .",
    "the two left supersymmetry operators are denoted @xmath21 , and the two right are denoted @xmath22 .",
    "there is a global @xmath5 fermion - number symmetry called , generated by @xmath6 .",
    "we take space @xmath23 to be the real line . when there are multiple vacua in a theory , there exist field configurations which are in one vacuum @xmath24 at @xmath25 and in another vacuum @xmath26 at the other end @xmath27 .",
    "these configurations are known as solitons , or in 1 + 1 dimensions , kinks . in the sector @xmath28",
    ", the superalgebra is @xmath29 = \\pm q^{\\pm } \\qquad\\ & \\left [ f ,   \\overline{q}^{\\pm } \\right ] = \\mp \\overline{q}^{\\pm } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath30 are the hamiltonian and the momentum operators , and all other anticommutators vanish .",
    "the appearance of a central term @xmath31 in superalgebras on non - compact spaces was noted long ago @xcite",
    ". an important consequence of the central term is a lower bound on the mass of any configuration in a given sector @xmath28 , namely @xcite @xmath32 the states whose mass saturates this bound are called bps states . in an @xmath0 theory in 1 + 1 dimensions , the bps states have another very special property : they and only they form two - dimensional multiplets under the supersymmetry algebra . other states",
    "form irreducible four - dimensional representations .",
    "many supersymmetric theories have an elegant landau - ginzburg description @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0 landau - ginzburg theory is defined in terms of a set of @xmath33 chiral superfields @xmath34 each consisting of a complex boson and a dirac fermion .",
    "the action is @xmath35 where @xmath36 , the superpotential , is a holomorphic function and @xmath37 is a khler potential .",
    "the bosonic part of the lg action is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the bosonic part of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a positive - definite metric . note the different kinds of derivatives : @xmath42 is the usual space - time derivative , whereas @xmath43 is a derivative with respect to the superfield @xmath44 .",
    "the vacua @xmath45 of the theory are obtained by minimizing the superpotential : @xmath46 the superpotential does not renormalize in a @xmath0 theory in two dimensions . moreover , by dimensional analysis , it follows that the khler term is always irrelevant if @xmath18 has non - zero dimension .",
    "this means that critical points can be described uniquely by their superpotential .",
    "one description of the superconformal minimal models is by a single superfield @xmath18 with @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this is called the @xmath48 series ; for @xmath20 even , one can orbifold by the @xmath49 symmetry and obtain the @xmath50 series .",
    "the @xmath50 superconformal series can be described by two superfields @xmath18 and @xmath51 with superpotential @xmath52 .",
    "we study time - independent solitons @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the mass of such a configuration is @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "since the metric is positive - definite , the first term in ( [ solitonmass ] ) is always greater than zero . choosing @xmath59 yields the mass bound ( [ bound ] ) with @xmath60 .",
    "the bps solitons are those which saturate this bound : @xmath61 this computation is classical , but the crucial point is that the superpotential @xmath36 does not renormalize .",
    "thus the exact non - perturbative mass of a bps soliton is given by ( [ bpsmass ] ) . from ( [ solitonmass ] )",
    "we see that a bps soliton must obey @xmath62 as a consequence , the superpotential for each soliton trajectory obeys @xmath63 this has a constant phase , so each bps solution can be represented in @xmath36-plane as a straight line . moreover , the mass is the length of the line .    in this paper",
    "we find the bps spectrum of the landau - ginzburg theory with superpotential @xmath64 for @xmath65 this theory is the superconformal @xmath66 minimal series @xcite .",
    "for @xmath67 the relevant perturbation @xmath68 produces an integrable massive theory .",
    "the non - degenerate vacua are obtained by minimizing the superpotential @xmath69 , and in @xmath18-plane they are at the corners of an @xmath20 -polygon and the origin : @xmath70 where @xmath71 . in @xmath36-plane",
    "the vacua are : @xmath72 they are at the corners of an @xmath20-polygon and the origin for @xmath20 odd , and at the corners of an @xmath73-polygon and the origin for @xmath20 even .",
    "because there is a @xmath74-symmetry acting transitively on the vacua in the @xmath18-plane , the soliton numbers between any two vacua @xmath75 except the origin depend only on @xmath76 mod @xmath20 : @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the soliton numbers connecting the vacuum @xmath79 to @xmath80 are all equal due to the same @xmath74-symmetry .",
    "we denote this number by @xmath81 there are thus @xmath82 + 1 $ ] distinct soliton numbers to be computed , namely @xmath83 \\right)$ ] .",
    "another interesting feature of these bps solitons is that their fermion number can be fractional , even though the supercharges have integer charge @xcite .",
    "the fractional part of the fermion number @xmath84 in the landau - ginzburg description is @xcite : @xmath85   \\label{frac}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 . in the theory ( [ superpot ] ) ,",
    "the states connecting the origin to another vacuum have fractional fermion number @xmath87 .",
    "states connecting any two vacua except the origin have zero fractional fermion number , so these doublets consists of a boson and a fermion .",
    "the multiplicities and the masses of all bps doublets in an @xmath0 supersymmetric theory can be computed directly and exactly . in this section",
    "we review the method , and set up the problem to be solved in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the witten index @xcite tr@xmath88 on closed space counts the vacua of the theory , and is independent of deformations of the theory . in @xcite , an open - space generalization of this",
    "was introduced : @xmath89 .",
    "\\label{index}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the length of space .",
    "the trace is over all states with boundary condition @xmath24 on the left and @xmath26 on the right . unlike the witten index ,",
    "@xmath91 does depend on @xmath12 .",
    "it is an index in the sense that it does not depend on most deformations of theory ; in a landau - ginzburg theory , it depends on the superpotential @xmath36 , but not the khler term @xmath37 .",
    "the index @xmath91 has simple expressions in both the ultraviolet and infrared limits of the theory . the leading contribution in the infrared limit",
    "@xmath92 are the one - particle states , since multi - particle states have in general higher energy .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , only the two - dimensional representation of the supersymmetry algebra thus contributes to the index in this limit . in other words , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a real anti - symmetric matrix counting the number of bps states between two vacua @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus if @xmath91 can be computed , one can read off the soliton numbers of all bps states .",
    "this equation is a slight over - simplification , because there are special cases where two - particle states can also contribute to the index ; these will be discussed below in section 5.2 .",
    "the ultraviolet limit @xmath95 corresponds to studying the theory at the conformal point . in a massless theory ,",
    "both left - moving and right - moving fermion numbers are conserved individually . in this limit , @xmath91 gives the left ( or right ) charges of the ramond vacua @xcite : @xmath96 these charges can easily be determined from the landau - ginzburg superpotential @xcite .",
    "for example , for the superconformal minimal models with superpotential @xmath97 , the charges are @xmath98 we will discuss in detail below how the @xmath99 ramond charges are related to the different possible boundary conditions @xmath100 on the solitons .    using the technique of topological - antitopological fusion developed in @xcite , it was shown in @xcite that one can derive differential equations for the @xmath91 in any @xmath0 supersymmetric theory . in a landau - ginzburg theory ,",
    "the superpotential gives these differential equations uniquely .",
    "the ramond charges serve as boundary conditions to determine the solution .",
    "one can extract the soliton numbers by solving these differential equations , but as discussed in detail in @xcite , there is far more information in such a solution than just the soliton numbers .",
    "moreover , the differential equations are non - linear , making the determination of asymptotic behavior ( much less finding the entire solution ) a non - trivial task . to avoid this complication ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite how to determine the @xmath101 of the index directly , without having to find the full solution .",
    "this has been proved for any @xmath0 supersymmetric theory in two dimensions by using an integral formulation of topological anti - topological fusion equations . for landau - ginzburg theories",
    "the connection has been proved by using the picard - lefschetz theory of singularities of differentiable maps .",
    "the problem is to compute the number of bps soliton doublets between any pair of vacua @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "bps solitons satisfy the equation ( [ solitoneqn ] ) .",
    "the idea is to study solutions of this equation near all the critical points , and continuously deform them away from the critical points .",
    "if two such solutions meet at some point in the @xmath36-plane along the line between two vacua , then there is a soliton .",
    "this must be a consistent solution because the equation ( [ solitoneqn ] ) is of first order .",
    "more precisely , we assume all critical points of @xmath36 are non - degenerate ( @xmath102 at the critical points ) and all critical values are distinct . by the morse lemma",
    "there is local system of coordinates in the neighborhood of any critical point @xmath103 such that : @xmath104 without loss of generality one can take vacuum @xmath24 at the origin in @xmath18 -plane with @xmath105 and vacuum @xmath26 such that @xmath106 is a real positive number .",
    "this means that @xmath107 for solutions of ( [ solitonmass ] ) near @xmath24 .",
    "also , up to second order terms the metric can be chosen to be @xmath108 .",
    "the solution of equation ( 5 ) which as @xmath109 is at @xmath24 is : @xmath110 where the @xmath111 and hence the @xmath39 near @xmath24 must be real .",
    "the superpotential of any soliton solution is thus a real @xmath112-dimensional sphere with radius denoted by @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath114 and hence the radius @xmath113 vanish right at the critical point @xmath24 .",
    "this sphere comprises all possible soliton solutions near @xmath24 , and we call it the _ wavefront _ @xmath115 : @xmath116 not for all @xmath117 there is a soliton solution : one must match the wavefront near @xmath24 to one near @xmath26 .",
    "the wavefront near @xmath26 is defined analogously ; all solutions of ( [ solitoneqn ] ) near @xmath26 ( here @xmath118 ) form an @xmath112-dimensional sphere @xmath119 which vanishes at @xmath26 .",
    "these definitions of @xmath120 are exactly the definitions of vanishing cycles in singularity theory .",
    "we thus need to review some basics facts about the picard - lefschetz theory of singularities of differentiable maps @xcite .",
    "assume a holomorphic function @xmath121 has only non - degenerate critical points @xmath122 whose critical values are all distinct @xmath123 . if @xmath124 is a non - critical value in @xmath36-plane , the pre - image of it under @xmath36 is an @xmath112 complex dimensional space ( non - singular level manifold ) @xmath125 .",
    "one defines a system of non - self - intersecting paths @xmath126 to connect @xmath124 to each of the critical values @xmath127 : @xmath128\\rightarrow \\mathbb{c}$ ] with @xmath129 , @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "these paths do not cross any critical values .",
    "also , they do not have to be cyclically ordered ( weakly distinguished paths ) . for @xmath131 near zero one fixes in the level manifold @xmath132 an @xmath112 dimensional sphere : @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the standard @xmath112 dimensional sphere in a system of local coordinates near a critical point @xmath135 : @xmath136 for @xmath137 , the sphere @xmath138 vanishes .",
    "moving along the path @xmath139 by homotopy lifting defines a family of @xmath112 dimensional cycles @xmath140 diffeomorphic to spheres for all @xmath141 $ ] . considering all critical points",
    "one obtains a set of @xmath142 vanishing cycles @xmath143 represented by the spheres @xmath144 .",
    "these cycles are in the non - singular level set @xmath145 and they form a basis in the homology group @xmath146 . each homology class @xmath143 is defined modulo orientation .",
    "the non - singular set @xmath147 is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of @xmath142 spheres each having a real dimension @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath124 tends to one of the critical values @xmath148 the corresponding cycle @xmath143 vanishes . in @xmath145",
    "the cycles can intersect .",
    "the intersection number of two cycles ( denoted by @xmath149 ) is a bilinear operation defined on the homology group in accord with the preferred orientation on @xmath145 .",
    "the orientation on @xmath150 is defined by the positive orientation on @xmath151 . for",
    "non - degenerate critical points with distinct critical values the intersection number takes values in the group of integers . in general the intersection number can take values in a subgroup of @xmath152 . by comparing the two preceding paragraphs",
    "one sees that the definition of cycles in singularity theory is indeed identical to that of the solutions of ( [ solitoneqn ] ) near a critical point .",
    "the result of @xcite relates the number of soliton solutions between vacua @xmath24 and @xmath26 to the intersection number @xmath153 of the corresponding cycles .",
    "we pick an arbitrary point @xmath124 on the line between @xmath154 and @xmath106 , and define the paths @xmath155 as straight lines connecting @xmath124 to @xmath156 and @xmath157 respectively .",
    "the two wavefronts @xmath120 are @xmath112 dimensional real cycles in @xmath145 for any @xmath124 . in @xmath158",
    "the two vanishing cycles @xmath120 intersect at a discrete number of points .",
    "the fact that equation ( [ solitoneqn ] ) is of first order assures that for each intersection point the flow with the vector field defined by ( [ solitoneqn ] ) reaches the critical points @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore for each intersection point of vanishing cycles we get a soliton solution .",
    "however , the number of points at which @xmath159 and @xmath160 intersect is not necessarily @xmath161 , because the latter counts each intersection point with @xmath7 depending on the orientations .",
    "moreover , as suggested by the supersymmetric index @xmath91 , the counting of bps solitons is naturally done with the insertion @xmath162 .",
    "assume we have two different trajectories between vacua @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "then , one has to compare the relative contribution of the two trajectories to @xmath163 and @xmath162 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if the two trajectories correspond to the same sign for intersection between cycles they also have the same fermion number mod 2 , and if they have opposite intersection number their fermion numbers differ by 1 mod 2 .",
    "also , including another vacuum @xmath164 the relative signs in the sectors @xmath165 and @xmath100 are correlated with @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "therefore the proper definition for the soliton number is @xcite : @xmath168 where the sum is over all solitons in sector @xmath100 .",
    "this definition is valid for even number of fields . because the intersection matrix of vanishing cycles for even number of fields is anti - symmetric the above definition is consistent with the physical requirement that the matrix @xmath169 be anti - symmetric .",
    "for an odd number of fields the soliton numbers are @xmath170 since @xmath171 counts the number of bps doublets , @xmath172 does as well .",
    "the results of @xcite thus reduce the problem of finding the bps spectrum to that of calculating the intersection numbers of the cycles .",
    "this can be done by studying the behavior of the cycles under deformation of the paths @xmath173 .",
    "if the paths are continuously deformed the vanishing cycles do not change as long as the paths do not cross any critical value .",
    "but if during deformations a path crosses a critical value a change of basis appears .",
    "let us consider two critical values @xmath148 and @xmath174 and two sets of paths @xmath175 and @xmath176 as in figure 1 .",
    "change into @xmath177    while @xmath178 can be deformed into @xmath179 without passing a critical value , the same is not true when deforming @xmath180 into @xmath181 .",
    "this change of paths can be viewed as an operation denoted by @xmath182 described as : @xmath183 and @xmath184 , followed by a continuous change of paths : @xmath185 and @xmath186 , where the _ simple loop _ @xmath187 is defined as the loop going along the path @xmath178 from the point @xmath124 to the point @xmath174 , going around the point @xmath174 in the positive direction ( anticlockwise ) and returning along the path @xmath188 to the point @xmath124 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the inverse of operation @xmath182 is the operation @xmath189 .    ]",
    "a result of picard - lefschetz theory is that the basis of vanishing cycles changes under the operation @xmath182 as : @xmath190 @xmath191 it is clear that the same change of basis of vanishing cycles obtained from operation @xmath182 is obtained by moving @xmath124 in clockwise direction as in figure 3 .    ]",
    "we can now define a monodromy matrix @xmath192 , which describes how the basis of cycles changes as @xmath124 is deformed in a complete circle .",
    "because of the basis - change formula ( [ basischange ] ) , the monodromy matrix depends on the intersection numbers .",
    "however , its eigenvalues can be computed explicitly in terms of the ramond charges , and so it will yield an equation for the soliton numbers . to define @xmath192 ,",
    "we take the set of paths @xmath193 to be straight lines ( figure 4 ) . because the soliton numbers have a simpler definition for an even number of fields let us assume @xmath33 is even .",
    "if @xmath124 is along the straight line connecting vacua @xmath148 and @xmath174 , one has @xmath194 .",
    "suppose instead @xmath124 is taken to be very far from the critical values .",
    "as @xmath124 is moved , @xmath124 will be collinear with pairs of vacua , and when this happens a change of basis occurs according to equation ( [ basischange ] ) .",
    "if @xmath124 goes completely around a large circle in clockwise direction with @xmath195 fixed , the resulting change of basis is called a monodromy .     connecting @xmath124 to the critical values @xmath148 are straight lines ]    let @xmath196 be the matrix whose only non - zero entry is the @xmath197 entry , which is equal to @xmath194 .",
    "the monodromy matrix @xmath192 is then an ordered product of change - of - basis matrices @xmath198 .",
    "as @xmath124 goes halfway around the circle it will be collinear with all possible pairs of critical values ; there are @xmath199 such pairs .",
    "we denote @xmath4 to be the ordered product of matrices @xmath200 as @xmath124 goes half the way around the circle by : @xmath201 since @xmath202 , as @xmath124 goes around the full circle the monodromy matrix is : @xmath203    the monodromy matrix contains information about the bps spectrum , namely the soliton numbers between all pairs of vacua .",
    "the crucial point is that it can be computed in a completely different way @xcite .",
    "it is known from singularity theory that the monodromy matrix is independent of finite deformations of the vacua .",
    "moreover , one can compute the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix directly in the superconformal limit @xmath204 , where all the @xmath205 are the same .",
    "they can be expressed in terms of @xmath5 charges of the ramond vacua @xmath206 . for an even number of fields",
    ", one has @xcite",
    "@xmath207 this is the key equation : the left - hand - side can be expressed solely in terms of the bps soliton numbers , while the right hand side gives the spectrum of charges of chiral fields of the superconformal theory .",
    "this equation is quite profound : it directly relates a property of the infrared ( the soliton spectrum ) to that of the ultraviolet ( the ramond charges ) .",
    "the assumption that the number of fields is even is not a restriction , because one can always add a non - interacting field @xmath208 to the superpotential .",
    "thus , for convenience in defining the soliton numbers in terms of intersection matrix of vanishing cycles , we consider the modified superpotential : @xmath209 this modified superpotential and the original one have the same @xmath18-plane and @xmath36-plane vacua geometry .",
    "the addition of the field @xmath208 only changes signs in the intersection matrix , and the actual soliton numbers are @xmath171 . since for functions of an even number of variables the self - intersection matrix of vanishing cycles is zero , the physical requirement @xmath210 follows directly .",
    "the exponentials @xmath211 of the ramond charges ( [ ramond ] ) for this theory are the zeroes of the polynomial @xmath212 @xmath213 with the last sign @xmath214 for @xmath20 odd and @xmath215 for @xmath20 even .",

    "since these are known to be all @xmath510 @xcite , we have @xmath511 the latter must be a two - soliton contribution , and we see how this contribution of @xmath87 to @xmath169 arises naturally in singularity theory . we have thus proven directly that the behavior already observed for @xmath485 persists for all @xmath318 .",
    "finding the soliton numbers in the anti - invariant space requires a new computation .",
    "the soliton numbers are related to the intersection numbers by @xmath512 @xmath513 note that the one - soliton number given by @xmath514 is in the anti - invariant space . to compute @xmath438 and @xmath439 we use again equation ( [ detm- ] ) .",

    "there are two such change of paths operations to change @xmath527 into @xmath528 : @xmath529 and @xmath530",
    ". however , they do not commute .",
    "-plane : @xmath531    since we want to obtain soliton numbers which do not depend on how the paths @xmath527 transform into @xmath528 , we take the change of basis matrix as being the symmetrized change of basis matrices of the two operations . for example , for the above change of paths the change of basis is given by : @xmath532 where @xmath48 and @xmath457 have the same meaning as in the case @xmath409 , and the anti - commutator has the elements : @xmath533 such matrices @xmath192 can be connected in order as they appear in the following sense ( @xmath534 ) : @xmath535 @xmath536 @xmath537 the sets of lines which do not pass through the origin can also be connected in the same way . for a given direction",
    "the parallel lines contain half of the soliton numbers but each one appears twice .",
    "however , we can connect such parallel lines by using @xmath538 to have each soliton number appearing once .",
    "then , we obtain the monodromy matrix @xmath404 : @xmath539 ^{n/2}\\ ] ] where : @xmath540 and @xmath541 is the sum of all @xmath48 matrices which correspond to the first and second set of parallel lines ( excluding @xmath542 ) such that all soliton numbers appear once .",
    "it has the elements : @xmath543 again , solving ( [ detm- ] ) reduces to solving : @xmath544 = p^{-}(z)\\ ] ] the computation of the determinant gives : @xmath545 .",

    "as for @xmath20-odd , we display graphically the soliton numbers for several particular cases of @xmath20-even in figure 11 . in @xmath36 plane",
    "the symmetry is only @xmath425 .",
    "the pattern is clear : there is one line ( one bps doublet ) connecting any two vacua except for the vacua which are collinear with the vacuum at the origin .",

    "straight lines represent bps states.,height=226 ]    we end the computation for @xmath20 even by noticing the similarity between this case and the most relevant perturbation of the @xmath50 series of minimal superconformal models given by @xmath552 .",
    "in fact , the two are related by an orbifold @xcite . for",
    "this perturbed @xmath50 series one can do similar computations as in sections 5.1 and 5.2 , and obtain exactly the same expressions for the determinants , and therefore the same soliton numbers .",
    "we have found the full bps spectrum of the @xmath0 landau - ginzburg theory @xmath553 for any @xmath20 .",
    "the picard - lefschetz theory of singularities of differentiable maps proved to be a powerful tool in finding the bps spectrum exactly .",
    "this technique is more direct than using topological anti - topological fusion equations , because extracting the appropriate behavior from those equations explicitly is difficult at best .",
    "there is one interesting consequence of this computation . as we already mentioned , the theories studied here are integrable @xcite .",
    "integrable models have the striking property that the @xmath554-matrix factorizes into two - body ones , and all scattering processes are completely elastic @xcite .",
    "this means that in any scattering process , the masses of the _ individual _ particles are conserved .",
    "the only possible consequences of scattering are a phase shift or changing internal quantum numbers .",
    "this fact , along with the fact that the boundary conditions at spatial infinity remain fixed in a collision , means that we can show there must be non - bps single - particle states .",
    "the argument for this is quite simple .",
    "consider a two - particle configuration @xmath555 , where @xmath24 and @xmath26 are vacua other than the origin .",
    "the masses of these bps particles are given by the length of the corresponding lines in the @xmath36 plane , namely @xmath556 , and @xmath557 .",
    "such a two - particle configuration is drawn for @xmath238 in figure 12 .",
    "when these two particles scatter , they must scatter to two particles @xmath558 .",
    "since the theory is integrable , there can be no particle production , and we must have @xmath559 and @xmath560 . note that it is not possible for @xmath561 ; the solitons must change sides in the scattering event .",
    "in fact , in general there is no vacuum @xmath164 where @xmath562 or with @xmath563 .",
    "this can be easily seen from the picture in figure 12 : there is no line @xmath564 of the same length as the line @xmath565 , and no line @xmath566 of the same length as @xmath567 .",
    "this means that the final state in this scattering process can not consist of bps states !",
    "the theory must contain additional states , and the scattering of bps states does not close onto itself .",
    "we have therefore proven that there are non - bps states mixing with the bps states here , as opposed to the models discussed in @xcite , where the entire spectrum consists only of bps states . the simplest scenario",
    "consistent with integrability and the bps spectrum is for there to exist non - bps states @xmath569 . presumably , these states are analogous to the breathers well known in the sine - gordon field theory .",
    "because of the integrability , the masses of these non - bps quartets must be the same as the bps states , except a non - bps particle of mass @xmath570 is not required",
    ". we will give the @xmath4 matrix for all of these states in the sequel @xcite .",
