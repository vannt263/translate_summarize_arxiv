    "post - asymptotic giant branch stars ( here , pagb stars ) are low mass stars evolving between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and the white dwarf cooling track .",
    "pagb stars evolve from stars with initial masses in the range 0.8@xmath0 to 8@xmath0 .",
    "thanks to mass loss on the red giant branch and principally on the agb , the pagb stars are widely considered to have masses of about @xmath1 or less .",
    "evolution from the cool agb star to a hot star at the beginning of the white dwarf cooling track is rapid with times of 10,000 years thought to be representative .",
    "gas lost previously by the star is ionized by the hot pagb central star to form a planetary nebula .",
    "the dust component of the mass loss may be detected as an infrared excess .",
    "pagb stars have been reviewed by kwok ( 1993 ) and van winckel ( 2003 ) .",
    "0.2 cm one reason for great interest in pagb stars is that they have the potential to provide observational constraints , particularly through studies of their chemical compositions , on the complex mix of evolutionary processes  nucleosynthesis , mixing and mass loss ",
    "occurring on the agb .",
    "interpretation of these constraints for field pagb stars is compromised in part because the composition and mass of the main sequence , red giant , and agb progenitor are not directly known .",
    "such compromises are essentially eliminated by finding a pagb star as a member of an open or globular cluster . 0.2 cm in this paper , we report on an abundance analysis of the a - type pagb star discovered by siegel & bond ( 2009 , in preparation ) in the globular cluster m79 .",
    "the location of the star in the colour - magnitude diagram is shown in figure  [ f_m79_color ] .",
    "the initial mass of this star must have been slightly in excess of the mass of stars now at the main sequence turn - off , say , @xmath2 .",
    "the star s composition may be referenced to that of the cluster s red giants , stars for which abundance analyses have been reported .",
    "comparison of abundances for the pagb and rgb stars may reveal changes imposed by the evolution beyond the rgb ; such changes are not necessarily attributable exclusively to internal nucleosynthesis and dredge - up .",
    "it was in the spirit of comparing the compositions of the pagb and rgb stars that we undertook our analysis .",
    "for the rgb stars , we use results kindly provided in advance of publication by carretta ( 2008 , private communication ) . 0.2 cm pagb stars because they are rapidly evolving are understandably rare in globular clusters . at spectral types of f and g ,",
    "a few luminous variables are known .",
    "these are sometimes referred to as type ii cepheids .",
    "abundance analyses of cluster variables have been reported , for example , for one or two stars in the clusters m2 , m5 , m10 , and m28 ( gonzalez & lambert 1997 ; carney , fry & gonzalez 1998 ) .",
    "these stars have ( @xmath3 of 0.5 - 0.6 rather than the @xmath4 of the m79 discovery . at even earlier spectral types than a , the pagb stars in globular stars are widely referred to as ` uv - bright ' stars ( see review by moehler 2001 ) .",
    "three such b - type stars have been subject to an abundance analysis - see thompson et al .",
    "0.2 cm in this paper , we present the abundance analysis of the m79 pagb star and compare its composition to that of the cluster s red giants . many determinations of the metallicity [ fe / h ] of cluster red giants have given estimates near [ fe / h]@xmath5 . where [ x]=@xmath6(x)@xmath7(x)@xmath8 .",
    "] for example , zinn & west ( 1984 ) give [ fe / h]@xmath9 and kraft & ivans ( 2003 ) give [ fe / h]@xmath10 .",
    "recently from high - resolution uves / flames spectra carretta and colleagues ( 2008 , private communication ) performed an abundance analysis for 20 elements obtaining [ fe / h]@xmath11 for a sample of ten rgb stars .",
    "spectra for the abundance analysis were obtained on five nights between 2008 january 15 and march 3 with the 2.7 meter harlan j. smith reflector and its @xmath12 cross - dispersed chelle spectrograph ( tull et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the chosen spectral resolving power was @xmath13 with 3 pixels per resolution element .",
    "full spectral coverage is provided from 3800   to 5700    with incomplete but substantial coverage beyond 5700  ; the effective short and long wavelength limits are set by the useful s / n ratio .",
    "a thar hollow cathode lamp provided the wavelength calibration .",
    "flat - field and bias exposures completed the calibration files .",
    "0.2 cm observations were reduced using the starlink reduction package echomop ( mills & webb 1994 ) .",
    "a series of 30 minute stellar exposures was combined to obtain the final spectrum .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of a line was measured with the package dipso using a fitted gaussian profile for lines weaker than 90 m  and direct integration for stronger lines .",
    "a section of the final spectrum is shown in figure  [ f_spectrum_part ] , among the identified lines , the strongest line ( excluding the mgii blend at 4481  ) is the tiii line at 4501.27   with an ew of 167 m .",
    "the weaker lines of fei at 4476.019   and tiii at 4470.840   have ews of 21 m  and 38 m , respectively . 0.2",
    "cm the heliocentric radial velocity measured from the final spectrum is @xmath145 km s@xmath15 with no evidence of a variation greater than about @xmath167 km s@xmath15 over the observing runs .",
    "this velocity is consistent with the cluster s velocity of @xmath17 km s@xmath15 given by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "this agreement between the pagb star s velocity and that of the cluster confirms a result given by siegel and bond ( 2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "the abundance analysis was undertaken with model atmospheres and the line analysis programme moog ( sneden 2002 ) .",
    "the models drawn from the atlas9 grid ( kurucz 1993 ) are line - blanketed plane - parallel atmospheres in local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and hydrostatic equilibrium with flux ( radiative plus convective ) conservation .",
    "moog adopts lte for the mode of line formation .",
    "a model is defined by the parameter set : effective temperature @xmath18 , surface gravity @xmath19 , chemical composition as represented by metallicity [ fe / h ] and all models are computed for a microturbulence @xmath20 = 2 km s@xmath15 . a model defined by the parameter set",
    "is fed to moog except that @xmath20 is determined from the spectrum and not set to the canonical 2 km s@xmath15 assumed for the model atmosphere .",
    "0.2 cm several methods are available for obtaining estimates of the atmospheric parameters from photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "most methods are sensitive to both @xmath18 and @xmath21 and , therefore , provide loci in the @xmath18 versus @xmath21 plane .",
    "we discuss several methods in an attempt to find consistent values for the effective temperature and gravity .",
    "bond ( 2005 , see also siegel & bond 2005 ) developed a photometric system with one of several aims being the detection of ` stars of high luminosity in both young ( yellow supergiants ) and old ( post - agb stars ) populations ' .",

    "stellar parameters @xmath18 and gravity @xmath19 are obtainable from the colour - colour diagrams ( @xmath26 ) versus ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 versus @xmath29 .",
    "bond provides calibration diagrams for metallicities [ fe / h ] = 0 and @xmath30 . 0.2 cm siegel ( 2008 , private communication ) reports the magnitudes of the m79 pagb star to be @xmath22=13.803 , @xmath23=12.480 , @xmath24=12.203 and @xmath25=11.744 .",

    "solutions for @xmath18 and @xmath20 are not very sensitive to the adopted surface gravity . to illustrate the sensitivity to @xmath18 , we show in figure  [ f_excitation ] the abundance - lep relations for 6200 k , 6500 k , and 6800 k , i.e. , @xmath56 k around the best value .",

    "the primary reason for iron s supremacy is that it provides a plentiful collection of both neutral and ionized lines : here , 42 fei and 25 feii lines .",
    "0.2 cm our spectrum provides other elements with lines from the neutral and singly - ionized atoms , although much less well represented than iron .",

    "figure  [ f_logg_teff ] shows that mg , fe and cr loci in the @xmath62 plane .",
    "an aspect of globular cluster membership is that one can estimate a star s surface gravity from the known luminosity , effective temperature and a constraint on the estimated stellar mass . combining the relations @xmath63 and @xmath64 , one obtains    @xmath65    0.2 cm the absolute visual magnitude is @xmath66 .",
    "this with bolometric corrections from fiorella castelli ( 2008 , private communication ) provides estimates of @xmath67 as weak functions of @xmath18 , @xmath21 , and [ fe / h ] : for example , @xmath18 = 6500k , @xmath21=1.5 and [ fe / h]= -2.0 give @xmath67 = 1740 .",
    "this absolute luminosity is consistent with the range @xmath67 = 1070 to 1862 reported by gonzalez & lambert ( 1997 ) from five rv tauri variables in other globular clusters and the theoretical characteristic that pagb stars evolve at approximately constant luminosity .",

    "apparently , the he - core flash at the tip of the rgb and evolution from the horizontal branch to the agb did not result in c enrichment from the addition of he - burning products to the atmosphere .",
    "0.2 cm comparison of the heavy element abundances for the pagb star with results for the rgb stars appears to provide a fascinating puzzle .",

    ", there is no evidence that the pagb star is a victim of @xmath138-processing on the agb .",
    "our [ eu / fe]@xmath149 matches the rgb stars eu abundance .",
    "the outstanding puzzle is the sr abundance of the pagb star .",
    "0.2 cm the [ sr / fe ] @xmath132 is clearly at odds with [ y / fe ] @xmath124 [ zr / fe ] @xmath150 for the rgb stars .",
    "moreover , among metal - poor stars  see the sample displayed by lambert & allende prieto ( 2002 )  the ratio [ sr / ba ] is positive but here [ sr / ba ] is highly negative ( @xmath151 ) ; the pagb star would then be a remarkable outlier far from the representative sample shown by lambert & allende prieto",
    ". it may be possible to conceive of a @xmath138-process scenario that reduces all three of these ratios yet keeps [ ba / fe ] close to the value for the rgb stars , but even highly contrived operating conditions for the @xmath138-process may not exist for producing the low [ sr / fe ] relative to [ y / fe ] and [ zr / fe ] .",
    "0.2 cm the key to the sr problem may be that the srii lines are strong and thus the sr abundances are particularly uncertain with the microturbulence and non - lte effects as major contributors to uncertainty .",
    "the consensus model adopts @xmath152 km s@xmath15 . if microturbulence is reduced to about @xmath153 km s@xmath15 , the sr abundance is raised to [ sr / h ] @xmath154 and [ sr / fe ] @xmath150 , a value consistent with the results for y and zr among the rgb stars .",
    "this value of @xmath20 is certainly not excluded by figure 5 .",
    "if one were confident that other effects ( i.e. , non - lte ) were not affecting the srii lines in a serious way , one might use the sr abundance to set @xmath20 for the abundance analysis .",
    "this alternative choice for @xmath20 has a minor effect on the other abundances except for the few elements represented exclusively by strong lines .",
    "the srii line profiles may be fitted with this lower @xmath20 and a modest value for the macroturbulence .",

    "a search for a correlation with the condensation temperature ( @xmath139 ) for an element returns a negative result .",
    "some field rv tauri variables show a striking correlation , e.g. , hp lyr ( giridhar et al . 2005 ) . in hp lyr ,",
    "the sc , and ti underabundances at @xmath155 k are 2 dex greater than for fe with @xmath156 k , ca with @xmath157 k is 1 dex more underabundant , and na at @xmath158 k is 1 dex more abundant than fe . for the consensus model , the [ x / fe ]",
    "are here not correlated at all with @xmath139 .",
    "there is no indication that sc and ti in the pagb star are underabundant relative to fe and other elements of similar @xmath139 .",
    "indeed , as noted above , the [ x / fe ] of the pagb star are not only generally equal to the values for the rgb star where dust - gas winnowing may be dismissed as a possible influence , but also essentially equal to the [ x / fe ] expected for a metal - poor star . the sr anomaly identified above is not attributable to dust - gas winnowing ; the @xmath139 of sr is intermediate between that of ca and fe .",
    "similarly there is no correlation of the abundances with the fip .",
    "if matching the [ fe / h ] of the pagb star to that of the rgbs is an overriding requirement in the selection of the model atmosphere parameters along with retention of the assumption of lte in the model s construction and the abundance analysis , one may pursue @xmath68 combinations that lie along the line of fe ionization equilibrium .",
    "a combination such as ( 7000 , 1.98 ) is needed .",
    "abundances for this and intermediate combinations are given in table 3 .",
    "0.2 cm this approach clearly provides balmer line profiles that are far broader than the observed profiles ( figure  [ f_balmer_profiles ] ) , an fe abundance from fei lines that decreases with increasing excitation potential ( figure  [ f_excitation ] ) .",
    "there is yet another problem raised by use of the ( 7000,1.98 ) model : this combination lies far off the locus set by the @xmath159 relation ( figure  [ f_logg_teff ] ) . to increase",
    "the @xmath21 from this relation requires an increase by 0.85 dex in the ratio @xmath160 ( equation 1 ) .",
    "clearly , the allowable range on @xmath161 does not permit anything but a very small part of this increase .",
    "the major part has to be attributed to a decrease of the luminosity @xmath162 .",
    "if one entertains the not implausible idea that the pagb star may be affected by circumstellar dust , one immediately realises that extinction from a circumstellar dust shell aggravates the problem because the @xmath162 inferred from the magnitude @xmath163 is then increased not decreased .",
    "luminosity @xmath162 may be decreased by a substantial reduction of the distance modulus but this negates the association of the star with m79 . in short , matching the pagb star s fe abundance to that of the rgb stars by choosing a much hotter classical model for the pagb star that is consistent with the ionization equilibrium of fe ( and approximately mg and cr too ) does not result in a satisfactory understanding of the pagb star .",
    "0.2 cm this unsatisfactory state of affairs may in part arise because of the retention of the assumption of lte . to first - order the principal non - lte effect may be the over - ionization of fe and similar metals .",
    "this over - ionization has a major effect on the strength of the lines of fei and similar metals . since the fe is predominantly present as fe@xmath164 , such non - lte effects are weak for feii lines",
    "also , effects of the overionization on the structure of the atmosphere are anticipated to be slight too because the additional contribution of electrons attributable to this non - lte effect is very small .",
    "thus , one might suppose that the feii lines are a safe indicator of the pagb star s fe abundance .",
    "0.2 cm discarding lte in this way and raising the pagb star s fe abundance from the feii lines to the rgb stars value ( where we assume non - lte effects are minimal for the giants ) requires a combination of a higher surface gravity and a higher effective temperature .",
    "the desired 0.6 dex increase in [ fe / h ] is very difficult to achieve by sliding slightly the pagb star along the @xmath159 relation ; table 4 shows that @xmath18 and @xmath6 g increases both raise the fe abundance derived from the feii lines . a very extreme slide to @xmath165 k and @xmath42 increases the fe abundance from feii lines by the desired 0.5 dex .",
    "thus , our simple assessment of likely non - lte effects does not ease at all the reconciliation of the pagb and rgb fe abundances .",
    "0.2 cm one is seemingly forced to the conclusion that the model atmosphere may require substantial revision for the pagb star .",
    "one concern is that the model atmospheres and the line analysis program assume a plane - parallel geometry but a spherical geometry may be more appropriate for the pagb star .",
    "heiter & eriksson ( 2006 ) evaluated this concern for stars of solar metallicity and temperatures and gravities spanning the values of our pagb star .",
    "their conclusion is that abundance errors resulting from use of the plane - parallel geometry in model and line analysis rather than a consistent use of spherical geometry are minor provided that the analysis is restricted to weak ( ew @xmath166 100 m ) lines .",
    "heiter & eriksson express the expectation that this conclusion is likely valid too for low - metallicity stars and this was verified by eriksson ( 2009 , private communication ) for this pagb star .",
    "apart from a few elements ( e.g. , sr ) , our analysis is indeed based primarily on weak lines .",
    "thus , the generally lower abundances for the pagb star relative to the rgb stars are not attributable to use of the inappropriate geometry .",
    "an alternative representation of the model atmospheres seems necessary .",
    "reproduction of the observed line strengths with the rgb star s composition may be possible by invoking a departure from the structure of line - forming regions predicted by the atlas9 model .",
    "two obvious qualitative possibilities are the presence of stellar granulation on small and/or large scales and a flatter temperature gradient over a uniform atmosphere .",
    "such a change in gradient requires a different balancing of heating and cooling in the affected regions .",
    "perhaps , convective transport of energy is inadequately modelled and/or ` mechanical energy ' ( e.g. , acoustic waves ) is supplied from the deep convective envelope .",
    "of course , a revised atmospheric structure invalidates the determination of atmospheric parameters based on atlas9 models .",
    "detailed exploration of semi - empirical atmospheres with might be undertaken to see how or if an atmospheric structure may be discovered that reconciles the wide variety of line strengths from the many elements with the composition of the rgb stars .",
    "this suggestion about a failure of classical atmospheres to predict correctly the temperature gradient echoes a previous similar suggestion concerning the atmospheres of the r crb stars , warm supergiants with a very h - deficient composition ( asplund et al .",
    "for those stars , the diagnostic indicating the failure was the strengths of the ci lines .",
    "the strengths of these lines should be quasi - independent of the atmospheric parameters because the continuous opacity is predicted to be from photoionization of carbon from levels only slightly greater in excitation than those providing the observed lines .",
    "these lines have very similar strengths across the r crb sample ( as expected ) but the observed strengths are markedly weaker than predicted by classical ( h - deficient ) atmospheres . after a comprehensive review of a suite of possible explanations for this `",
    "carbon problem ' , asplund et al . proposed a flattening of the temperature gradient ; the flattening investigated was assumed to apply to the entire atmosphere but it might possibly arise as a net effect of severe stellar granulation .",
    "the authors remarked that ` spectra of ( h - rich ) f supergiants should be studied in attempts to trace similar effects ' .",
    "this we have done for a star whose composition may be rather securely inferred from the rgb ( and other ) cluster members .",
    "although our study might appear to suggest that the ` carbon problem ' affects h - rich as well as h - deficient supergiants , galactic warm supergiants both in and out of the cepheid instability strip may be innoculated against the ` carbon problem ' ; the compositions determined spectroscopically are consistent with the various lines of evidence independent of spectroscopy that these stars must have an approximately solar metallicity .",
    "thus , the parameter space over which the ` carbon problem ' affects h - rich supergiants remains to be defined .",
    "overall metallicity may be a key factor .",
    "our exploration of the pagb star in m79 began with the expectation that either the star might show the canonical effects of the third dredge - up on the agb ( i.e. , notably , a carbon and @xmath138-process enrichment ) or the effects of dust - gas winnowing or the fip effect .",
    "the exploration was derailed when it became apparent that an analysis using standard tools of the trade showed no evidence of expected abundance effects but rather an apparent 0.5 dex deficiency of iron and other elements .",
    "qualitative considerations of how standard tools might be modified to effect an upward revision of the abundances by 0.5 dex led to the idea that the temperature profile of the pagb s atmosphere may be flatter than in a classical atmosphere .    acquisition and analysis of a superior high - resolution spectrum",
    "may test our proposal concerning the atmospheric structure .",
    "it will not be difficult to improve upon the quality of our spectrum acquired with a ` small ' ( 2.7 m ) telescope : high s / n ratio and wavelength coverage are desirable .",
    "detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution , particularly across the balmer jump may be valuable in assessing the temperature profile .",
    "our conclusion that standard model atmospheres are an inadequate representation of this post - agb star would not have been drawn had the star not been a member of a globular cluster . for a field star",
    ", the conclusion would simply have been that [ fe / h ] @xmath32 represented the star .",
    "the conclusion also suggests that abundance analyses of field pagb stars may need reconsideration .",
    "construction - empirically or theoretically - of more realistic model atmosphere will be very challenging but the task seems important if one is to unravel more completely the secrets of internal nucleosynthesis , dust - gas winnowing and the fip effect that the post - agb stars hold in the atmospheric compositions .",
    "this research was begun when howard bond and mike siegel unselfishly alerted us to their discovery of the pagb star in m79 .",
    "we thank them both for the opportunity to analyse this interesting star .",
    "we are especially grateful to eugenio carretta for providing unpublished information on the composition of rgb stars in m79 .",
    "we thank fiorella castelli for providing bolometric corrections for stars like the pagb star in m79 and bengt gustafsson and kjell eriksson for offering comments on the use of spherical rather than plane - parallel atmospheres .",
