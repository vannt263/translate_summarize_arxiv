    "domain self - patterning on the nanoscale , particularly if the nanoscale chemical ordering can be engineered or tuned , is the goal of much research in the nanoscience and nanotechnology area .",
    "potential applications include the use of the surfaces of such materials as templates for the assembly of molecular monolayers , for the reliable synthesis of functional nano - structured materials or for the structured adsorption of gas species .",

    "]    the 2d apparent phase separation into compositionally distinct areas described above is strongly reminiscent of the 1d atomic order that takes place in many compositionally flexible ordered phases .",
    "the list is very extensive , but one can cite for instance many binary and/or ternary alloy systems ,  @xcite reduced rutile structures such as the ti@xmath8o@xmath9 system ,  @xcite reo@xmath2 related compounds such as the moo@xmath10 system ,  @xcite the hexagonal perovskite related lati@xmath11o@xmath2 family  @xcite , the @xmath12ta@xmath13o@xmath14wo@xmath2 system ,  @xcite and others .",
    "@xcite in most of these 1d compositionally ordered arrangements , the basic driving mechanism is the maximization of the separation of _ minority _ structural motifs within a matrix of an underlying sub - structure . in the case of binary alloy systems , for example , there is usually a well - defined majority motif such as an ordered cu@xmath2au unit which is , as regularly as possible , interleaved with a minority anti - phase boundary ( apb ) type structural motif , which locally has a different composition and leads to a continuously variable overall composition dependent upon the spatial distribution of the minority motif .",
    "likewise , in the case of the reduced rutile ti@xmath8o@xmath9 system , the majority motif is the rutile type tio@xmath13 structure , while the minority motif is a crystallographic shear plane ( csp ) , which again changes the overall composition if `` regularly '' and uniformly arranged .",
    "these compositional orderings are one - dimensional and often yield patterns with composition varying in the nanoscale in the form of stripes ( e.g. see fig .",

    "@xcite very recently , the main ideas have been extended to the analysis of the distribution of minority motifs in _ two - dimensional _",
    "systems ,  @xcite showing that pseudouniform arrangements can originate as the result of a simple quest for maximal dilution of a minority motif within lattice - restricted sites . in wide ranges of composition",
    ", the dilution drive was shown to stabilize 1d stripe arrangements oblique to the underlying lattice , following predictable rules based on the alternation of sub - units of different compositions on the nanoscale , but still keeping an overall identity as one single phase .",
    "the stripe arrangements were again shown to be easily describable as occupationally modulated structures , needing only a single modulation vector ( as befits their intrinsic one - dimensionality ) that can be determined unambiguously from the diffraction diagram of the system .",
    "in this paper we show that these findings can be extended to the case of intrinsically two - dimensional patterns , which need _ two _ modulation vectors for their superspace description .",
    "these 2d pseudouniform arrangements appear in certain ranges of composition , and in some cases exhibit nano - chessboard - like features similar to those observed in the compounds mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "these patterns , resulting again from a basic drive to uniformity or maximal dilution within a lattice , involve a coherent arrangement of structural motifs , which is rather different from the idea of ordered spinodal decomposition or phase segregation that has been previously proposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1dstripe ] we review the basic ideas and results on pseudouniform stripe orderings in a simple two - dimensional @xmath19 binary model presented recently ( ref .  ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] we discuss the features and superspace description of a different family of pseudouniform @xmath19 orderings which are intrinsically two - dimensional , including the determination of their two modulation vectors and their direct correspondence with the composition of the system .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec : realsystems ] we show how the above ideas can be useful to describe orderings in real systems .",
    "the basic patterns appearing due to a drive to maximal dilution of minority motifs , abstracted from any other effects present in real systems , can be studied using a simple model of a square lattice with binary composition @xmath19 , in which the @xmath20 `` atoms '' represent the minority motifs . in ref .",
    "the dilution drive was originally mimicked by isotropic yukawa - type repulsive interactions between the @xmath20 particles , and a simple lattice - gas simulated - annealing method was used to explore and generate pseudouniform patterns by minimizing the repulsion energy . for most compositions , stripe orderings of the type shown on fig .",
    "[ fig:1dstripes ] were found to optimize the lattice - ordered dilution of the @xmath20 atoms .",
    "the stripes are formed by the concatenation of _ tiles _ , parallelepipeds delineated by @xmath20 atoms , with a fixed composition and orientation within a stripe .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig:1dstripes](a ) , the @xmath20 atoms ( the larger black dots ) are present in the proportion @xmath4=5/12 and they achieve an ordered distribution as close as possible to uniformity by forming a sequence of @xmath20-rich and @xmath20-poor stripes of tiles with composition 1/2 and 1/3 respectively ( the smaller , square tile contains one @xmath21 and one @xmath20 atom , while the larger tile contains one @xmath20 and two @xmath21 atoms ) . as the overall @xmath20 fraction @xmath4=5/12 is closer to 1/2 than to 1/3 , the 1/2 stripe regions are dominant ( by a ratio 3:2 ) , and the 1/3 stripes have minimal width and are isolated , as if they could be considered minority motifs themselves , subject to a dilution drive .",
    "the fact that the stripe sequence and makeup follow strict rules as a function of overall composition was one of the main results of ref .  .",
    "the rules are based on the decomposition of the overall @xmath20 fraction @xmath4 in irreducible terms according to the farey tree construction  @xcite : for example , @xmath4=5/12 can be decomposed as 1/2 @xmath22 1/2 @xmath22 1/3 @xmath22 1/2 @xmath22 1/3 , where the @xmath22 notation indicates a simultaneous addition of numerator and denominator in the fractions ( e.g. @xmath23 = @xmath24 , which physically corresponds to the concatenation of two subsets of motifs of concentrations @xmath25=@xmath26 and @xmath27=@xmath28 ) this leads to the so - called uniform sequence [ 22323 ] , which compactly indicates the composition and arrangement of the basic tiles in a pseudouniform stripe configuration .     for @xmath4 = 5/12 ( a ) and @xmath4 = 3/14 ( b ) , obtained via simulated - annealing optimization using an isotropic yukawa - type repulsive interaction among the @xmath20 atoms .",

    "only superstructure reflections are shown .",
    "the crosses indicate the reciprocal unit cell of the underlying square lattice .",
    "the superstructure reflections are indexed as satellite reflections according to the chosen primary modulation wave vector . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:1dstripes](b ) shows an analogous stripe ordering for @xmath4=3/14 , where stripes with composition 1/5 and 1/4 are arranged according to the uniform sequence [ 554 ] .",
    "the stripe pseudouniform sequence corresponding to any other composition can be derived using the farey tree construction . in most cases",
    "the arrangement involves irreducible tiles of compositions @xmath29 and @xmath30 bracketing the overall @xmath20 fraction @xmath4 .",
    "these tiles can be seen as encoding at a local level the drive for dilution , and their overall arrangement according to the rules results in a pseudouniform intergrowth . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the details of the repulsive model potential influence the details of the stability of different arrangements , so a purely repulsive criterion does not univocally lead to a single solution in two dimensions . hence our consistent use of the term _ pseudouniform _ to refer to the these orderings .",
    "fine differences in stability are in practice irrelevant when one takes into account that the drive for dilution is a convenient but rough simplification of the state of affairs in real systems .",
    "this suggests that a fruitful approach to the problem of cataloging pseudouniform orderings in two dimensions is to abstract the basic ingredients , which are the irreducible , locally uniform , tiles , and their juxtaposition into intergrowth arrangements following appropriate rules .",
    "another key result of ref .",
    "is that the arrangements of the type shown in figure  [ fig:1dstripes ] can be considered as compositionally modulated structures with a single composition - dependent primary modulation wave vector ( a 1d modulation ) .",
    "@xcite the fourier spectra ( square modulus of the geometric structure factor ) of these two examples are shown in figure  [ fig:1dstripes](c ) and  [ fig:1dstripes](d ) .",
    "one can see that the wave vectors ( 5/12)(1,1 ) and ( 3/14)(2,1 ) , respectively , which are approximately orthogonal to the stripe direction , determine the location of the most intense _ satellite _ reflections stemming from the ordering . within the superspace formalism originally developed to describe incommensurately modulated structures ,  @xcite these pseudouniform orderings can be described as long - period but commensurate structures with a simple step - like occupational modulation , with values either `` atom @xmath21 '' or `` atom @xmath20 '' in the relevant proportion , and using those vectors as primary modulation wave vectors .",
    "more specifically , a pseudouniform striped ordering is fully defined by an occupational modulation function @xmath31 of period 1 with value `` atom @xmath20 '' in the interval @xmath32 and value `` atom @xmath21 '' in the interval @xmath33 and a modulation vector * q * that depends on @xmath4 according to definite rules ,  @xcite such that the kind of atom occupying a site * m * of the lattice is determined by the value of this function at @xmath34=*q*@xmath35*m*. the continuous variable @xmath34 of the modulation function can be identified with the coordinate along the _ internal space _ used in the superspace formalism .",
    "thus , when described by means of occupational modulations , pseudouniform orderings have their modulation functions reduced to simple consecutive @xmath21- and @xmath20-valued intervals ( _ atomic domains _ ) defined along the internal space in the superspace formalism .",
    "[ sec:2d ]      [ sec : snub ]    in some circumstances more complex , essentially two - dimensional , ordered configurations in the @xmath19 system can become competitive and prevail ( in the sense of maximal dilution ) over the 1d striped arrangements studied in ref .  .",
    "for the case of a square lattice and an ideal isotropic dilution drive this happens for compositions within the interval 1/5@xmath361/4 .",
    "this composition interval is special because the basic tiles corresponding to the compositions @xmath4=1/4 and @xmath4=1/5 can be juxtaposed with different orientations ( the two sides of the two tiles have the same length ) , forming two - dimensional patterns ( tilings ) .",
    "these 2d patterns were already considered in ref .   in a simple context . here",
    "we present a more complete picture of this family of orderings , their generating principles , and their description as modulated structures .",
    "simulations for the repulsive lattice - gas model mentioned in the previous section indeed confirm the apparition of intrinsically 2d ordered patterns in this composition range . fig .",
    "[ fig : snub29 ] shows the ground states obtained for a composition @xmath4=2/9 for two different sizes of the simulation supercell ( subject to periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the pseudouniform [ 45 ] stripe arrangement , in agreement with the rules explained in the previous section , was obtained for a minimal 9@xmath379 supercell ( figure  [ fig : snub29](b ) ) .",
    "but for a 12@xmath3712 supercell , a completely different ordering pattern is stabilized ( figure  [ fig : snub29](a ) ) .",
    "it has the form of a so - called snub - square tiling  @xcite ( with a slight modification : the rhombic 1/4 tile can be considered formed by two triangles that are isosceles instead of being equilateral as in the canonical snub - square tessellation ) .",
    "this ordering pattern ( henceforth ssq ordering ) prevails in the simulations over the stripe arrangement if the boundary conditions are compatible with both types of orderings .     for @xmath4=2/9 ,",
    "obtained with simulations based on an isotropic yukawa - type repulsive interaction among the minority @xmath20 atoms , for 12@xmath3712 ( a ) and 9@xmath379(b ) simulation boxes , and their corresponding fourier spectra ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the primary modulation wave vectors , one for the stripe arrangement ( b ) and two for the 2d tiling ( a ) , are indicated in the corresponding fourier diagram .",
    "the crosses in ( c ) and ( d ) indicate the reciprocal unit cell of the underlying square lattice .",
    "the superstructure reflections are indexed as satellites using the primary wave vector(s ) . ]",
    "a comparison of the distribution of @xmath20-@xmath20 distances points to the main reason for the prevalence of the ssq ordering over the striped one . as pointed out by watson ,  @xcite",
    "both have the same distribution of @xmath20-@xmath20 interatomic distances up to @xmath38 ( in cell parameter units of the underlying square lattice ) , but the ssq ordering avoids the next distance @xmath39 associated with neighbours separated by a vector ( 3,2 ) or ( 2,3 ) , which is present in the striped arrangement .",
    "figure  [ fig : snub29](c ) and  [ fig : snub29](d ) presents sketches of the fourier spectra of the ssq ordering and of the competing striped arrangement .",
    "they clearly show the primary modulation wave vector(s ) that can be identified in each case .",
    "the superstructure reflections of the striped arrangement can be indexed as linearly arranged satellites , with the strongest one being given by the modulation wave vector * q*= ( 2/9)(2,1 ) , in accordance with the rules established in ref .  .",
    "the diffraction pattern of the ssq ordering requires instead two primary wave vectors for a simple indexation of the satellite reflections , and the strongest satellites indicate the most obvious choice : * q*@xmath40=(1/2,1/6 ) and * q*@xmath13=(1/6,1/2 ) .",
    "the relevance of the ssq - type arrangements as 2d orderings that could maximize somehow the uniformity of the distribution of a minority component for some specific compositions was pointed out in ref .  .",
    "we stress here that these configurations are indeed observed as ground states in simulations of lattice gas models with repulsive interactions that mimick an isotropic drive to uniformity . in the following",
    "we will show their hierarchical structure when they are interpreted in terms of uniform sequences , and how they can produce nano - chessboard and nano - diamond patterns . in this framework",
    ", it will be shown that this type of arrangements , when described as compositional modulated structures , have some simple basic common ingredients which can be generalized and applied to explain and rationalize orderings in real systems generated at least in part by a drive to maximal uniformity , including ordered patterns in the nano scale .",
    "the ssq ordering for @xmath4=2/9 can be seen as a perfect array of intercrossing ribbons , each one formed by single tiles arranged in a 1/4@xmath221/5 sequence .",
    "( from now on , to emphasize the actual arrangement of motifs in a sequence , we will use a slightly modified notation : \\{45 } indicates in this case an alternating sequence of 1/4 and 1/5 tiles , while the [ ] form will be reserved for pure numerical farey term sequences for a specific concentration . in the stripe - ordering cases",
    "both notations are equivalent . )",
    "this topology , which avoids the distance @xmath39 present in the stripe arrangement , can be generalized to any other composition in the interval 1/5@xmath361/4 .",
    "@xcite for compositions different from 2/9 , it is not possible to avoid the @xmath39 distance completely , but in general the @xmath20-@xmath20 distance distribution will still be favorable when compared to the stripe ordering . following the argument in the previous section , we will discuss these generalized ssq orderings in terms of our basic mechanism of juxtaposing appropriate tiles following certain rules , and we will not be concerned any more with detailed questions of maximal stability within a repulsive model . figure  [ fig : gensnub941](a ) shows an example of a generalized ssq ordering with @xmath412/9 .",
    "it corresponds to the case @xmath4=9/41 , and is characterized by the crossing of two kinds of ribbons , one corresponding to the tile sequence \\{554 } ( shown in the figure with shaded 1/5 tiles ) and the other to the sequence \\{445}. in each ribbon , the minority tiles appear in a proportion 1/3 , and the \\{445 } ribbons are also a minority in a proportion 1/3 .",
    "the minority ratio 1/3 ( which we will henceforth denote by @xmath42 ) , is thus a key parameter in the construction of the pattern .",
    "in fact , if we take abstract motifs @xmath43 and @xmath44 , both the tile sequence in each ribbon and the ribbon arrangement sequence are instances of the physical sequence \\{@xmath45 } ( uniform sequence [ 3 ] ) , as befits a concentration @xmath42=1/3 . by comparison , for the ssq ordering for @xmath4=2/9 in figure  [ fig : snub29](a ) , @xmath42=1/2 , which corresponds to a simple alternation of 1/4 and 1/5 tiles on each ( identical ) ribbon and a simple alternation in the ribbon arrangement ( uniform sequence [ 2 ] for @xmath42=1/2 ) .    the parameter @xmath42 fully characterizes the generalized ssq orderings by determining the hierarchical tiling arrangement , both at the level of each ribbon , and at the level of ribbon kinds . as it relates to a minority concentration , we can take without loss of generality @xmath461/2 , and the general relation between @xmath42 and @xmath4 is given by :  @xcite @xmath47 where the plus sign in the denominator corresponds to 1/5@xmath362/9 ( with 1/4 tiles underrepresented ) , and the minus sign to 2/9@xmath361/4 ( with relative abundance of 1/4 tiles ) .",
    "[ fig : gensnub941](b ) shows the corresponding arrangement for a composition much closer to 1/5 , @xmath42=1/9 ( @xmath4=81/389=0.20826 ) .",
    "this ordering optimizes the distribution of @xmath20-@xmath20 interatomic distances towards larger values by forming large squares of composition @xmath4=1/5 , separated by single ribbons with an inverted 1/9 proportion of 1/5 tiles , in an effective sequence \\{444444445}. despite the large size of the square blocks , the system can not be considered subject to phase segregation . on the contrary ,",
    "the regions with different local composition are coherently interleaved and ordered as a single phase .",
    "paradoxically , it is the quest for uniformity that can drive the system into this type of chessboard orderings .     for ( a ) @xmath4=9/41=0.219512 ( @xmath42=1/3 ) and ( b ) @xmath4=81/389=0.20826 ( @xmath42=1/9 ) and their corresponding fourier spectra ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",

    "the superstructure reflections are indexed as satellites using the primary wave vectors that are indicated . ]    for @xmath42 values of type @xmath48 , the patterns become more complex , as the ribbons with a proportion @xmath48 of basic tiles of type either 1/4 or 1/5 must be ordered according to a 1d non trivial pseudouniform sequence of the type explained in the previous section .",
    "the presence of 1d uniform sequences ( derived from the farey - tree construction ) along the individual ribbons is in fact the signature that the ordering is being driven by a uniformity quest .",
    "figure  [ fig : gensnub225 ] shows two examples for @xmath42=2/7 and 3/7 .     for ( a ) @xmath4=49/225=0.217778 ( @xmath42=2/7 ) and ( b ) @xmath4=49/221=0.221719 ( @xmath42=3/7 ) ]    one can see in this figure that a more complex uniform sequence is realized in the way the 1/4 and 1/5 basic tiles are arranged along each oblique ribbon , with either 1/4 or 1/5 tiles as minoritary in a proportion @xmath42 . for @xmath42=2/7 ( = 1/3@xmath221/4 ) ,",
    "the relevant abstract uniform sequence is \\{aabaaab } ( [ 34 ] ) , leading to interlocking ribbons of the form \\{4454445 } and \\{5545554 } , which themselves are in a proportion 2/7 with the same sequencing .    for a rational value of @xmath4 , the corresponding @xmath42 according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) is in most cases irrational , and therefore the generalized ssq ordering for that @xmath4 is incommensurate with respect to the underlying lattice .",
    "the ribbons of basic tiles will follow an aperiodic uniform sequence corresponding to the irrational value of @xmath42 , still according to the farey tree construction .",
    "@xcite thus , the tendency to uniformity could conceivably stabilize 2d incommensurate orderings of minority motifs even if their proportion is a simple rational value .",
    "for instance , the generalized ssq ordering for @xmath4=3/14 , which competes with the stripe arrangement shown in figure  [ fig:1dstripes](b ) , would be an incommensurate ordering with @xmath42 having an irrational value close to 2/9 . within",

    "the only other essential ingredient that makes the ssqs orderings more uniform than the stripe arrangements for the same composition is the intercrossing feature that tends to eliminate as much as possible the @xmath39 distance .      although the generalized ssq orderings discussed above present a large variety of arrangements , their diffraction patterns are very similar .",
    "they exhibit a strong hierarchy in the intensity of the superstructure reflections , characteristic of modulated structures ( see figures  [ fig : snub29 ] , [ fig : gensnub941 ] , and  [ fig : gensnub135 ] ) .",

    "one of the features which are present in the above discussion is the possibility of constructing the orderings through the juxtaposition ( intergrowth ) of basic tiles .",

    "modulated structures with modulation functions of this type are very efficient for distributing regularly minority motifs in real space .",
    "with all the evidence presented so far ( here and in the previous work over several years )  @xcite we can say that in a real system the knowledge of the relevant modulation vectors ( extracted from its diffraction diagram ) is sufficient to design , through the rules explained above , a compositionally modulated model which corresponds to an atomic ordering with a high degree of uniformity in the distribution of some specific motif .",
    "thus we can postulate an atomic distribution model with a specific composition and a maximal dilution consistent with the observed modulation vectors .",

    "but nevertheless , this simple occupational modulation with an intrinsic tendency to uniformity and consistent with its modulation vectors in a binary system , is sufficient to reproduce basic features of the real system .",
    "notice for instance the shift of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 occupation sites in contiguous patches of composition @xmath77 of the chessboard , as proposed in the model for li@xmath71nd@xmath72tio@xmath2 of ref .  .",
    "[ fig : modelexp](c ) shows the geometric diffraction pattern of this 2d @xmath19 nano - chessboard arrangement .",
    "it is remarkable that despite the strong anharmonicity of the occupational modulation only odd - order satellites are observable .",
    "this is consistent with the fourier decomposition of the underlying two dimensional step - like occupational modulation . in the real system",
    "even - order satellites close to the main reflections are also significant , which is probably due to the strong displacive modulations in the perovskite framework ( mainly tiltings ) , induced by the cation ordering .",

    "we have shown that a drive towards dilution of minority structural motifs constrained to an underlying lattice is sufficient to produce two - dimensional orderings with local composition variations in the nanoscale .",
    "the dilution can be achieved in practice by the combination or intergrowth of basic tiles that encapsulate a local repulsion of minority motifs .",
    "this combination principle is able to generate orderings that are hierarchically structured , adopting for certain compositions the form of nano - chessboards or diamond - like patches . in all cases",
    ", regions of two different effective compositions are interleaved coherently , with long - range order .",
    "the mechanism leading to composition patterning from a dilution drive has already been documented in other systems : layer arrangement in compositionally flexible layered compounds ,  @xcite and two - dimensional systems exhibiting effectively 1d stripe patterns .",
    "@xcite here we find what appears to be a segregation of phases instead of a pseudouniform distribution , but these arrangements are in fact near - optimally uniform by any reasonable criterion , and their underlying structure ( now essentially two - dimensional instead of effectively 1d ) can be described by the same recipe at work in the pseudouniform systems previously studied : modulation vectors directly and simply determined from the intensity distribution in the diffraction diagram , and step - like occupational modulations satisfying a closeness condition for these modulation vectors .",
    "the description in terms of occupational modulations , best represented using the tools of the superspace formalism , is thus seen as the unifying structural principle in a wide variety of systems which exhibit in some degree a dilution drive .",
    "the key idea is that minority motifs maximally scattered in real space are represented by compact regions in the internal coordinates of the superspace construction .",
    "we have shown that this powerful principle seems to be at work for two kinds of relevant experimental systems . in the case of the distribution of vacancies in la@xmath64sr@xmath15cu@xmath65o@xmath66 , ( la , sr)@xmath65cu@xmath65o@xmath67 and la@xmath13sr@xmath68cu@xmath65o@xmath69 ,  @xcite the resulting pattern",

    "the nano - chessboard arrays , and similar patterns exhibiting composition patterning , that have been recently observed in composition flexible systems such as li@xmath0nd@xmath1tio@xmath2 are strongly reminiscent of the kinds of hierarchical real - space orderings that appear in uniformity - driven simple models .",
    "they reproduce basic features of the observed nano - chessboard arrangements , and their fourier spectra exhibit the kind of strong hierarchical satellite structure present in the experimental diffraction diagrams .",
    "we can thus suggest that the observed compositional changes at the nanoscale in these compounds have their origin , at least partially , in a drive for uniformity , maintaining the coherency of a single phase , and are not , as previously proposed , due to any kind of phase separation .",
