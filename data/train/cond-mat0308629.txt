    "it is given by @xmath71 notice that a walk may cross the same node several times thus the largest possible walk length can be @xmath72 .",
    "the poisson summation formula @xmath73 allows us to simplify ( [ lija ] ) .",
    "firstly , let us note that in most of real networks @xmath74 thus we can assume @xmath75 that gives @xmath76 .",
    "secondly , we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the exponential integral function that for negative arguments is given by @xmath79 @xcite , where @xmath80 is the euler s constant . due to ( [ assumption ] )",
    "the integral in the expression for @xmath81 becomes zero . finally , every integral in the last term of the summation formula ( [ poissonform ] ) is equal to zero owing to the generalized mean value theorem @xcite .",
    "it follows that the equation for the apl between @xmath11 and @xmath12 may be written as @xmath82    the average intervertex distance for the whole network depends on a specified degree distribution @xmath5 @xmath83 a similar result @xmath84 was obtained by dorogovtsev _",
    "the formulas ( [ lij ] ) and ( [ lrg ] ) diverge when @xmath85 , giving the well - known expression for percolation threshold in undirected random graphs ( [ pc ] ) .      for these networks",
    "the degree distribution is given by the poisson function @xmath86 .",
    "however , since @xmath87 can not be calculated analytically for poisson distribution thus the @xmath88 may not be directly obtained from ( [ lrg ] ) . to overcome this problem we take advantage of the mean field approximation .",
    "let us assume that all vertices within a graph possess the same degree @xmath89 .",
    "it implies that the @xmath88 between two arbitrary nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( [ lrg ] ) should describe the average intervertex distance of the whole network @xmath90    until now only a rough estimation of the quantity has been known .",
    "one has expected that the average shortest path length of the whole er graph scales with the number of nodes in the same way as the network diameter .",
    "we remind that the diameter @xmath91 of a graph is defined as the maximal distance between any pair of vertices and @xmath92 .",
    "fig.[figer ] shows the prediction of the equation ( [ ler ] ) in comparison with the numerically calculated @xmath88 in classical random graphs .",
    "the basis of the @xmath93 model is its construction procedure .",
    "two important ingredients of the procedure are : continuous network growth and preferential attachment .",
    "the network starts to grow from an initial cluster of @xmath94 fully connected vertices .",
    "each new node that is added to the network creates @xmath94 links that connect it to previously added nodes .",
    "the preferential attachment means that the probability of a new link growing out of a vertex @xmath11 and ending up in a vertex @xmath12 is given by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 @xcite denotes the connectivity of a node @xmath12 at the time when a new node @xmath11 is added to the network .",
    "taking into account the time evolution of node degrees in @xmath93 networks one can show that the probability @xmath97 is equivalent to ( [ pij1 ] ) .",
    "now let us consider the conditional probability @xmath98 .",
    "checking the possible time order of the vertices @xmath99 it is easy to see that in five of @xmath100 cases @xmath101 and in a good approximation we get instead of ( [ pijxb ] ) the result @xmath102.\\ ] ]    it was found @xcite that the degree distribution in @xmath93 network is given by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 , and the scaling exponent @xmath105 .",

    "there is a visible discrepancy between the theory and numerical results when @xmath110 .",
    "the discrepancy disappears when the network becomes denser i.e. when @xmath111 increases .",
