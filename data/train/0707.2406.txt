    "lately there has been new interest in the study of the expansion of the zeta function via the pochhammer s polynomials .",
    "this is related to the original idea of riesz @xcite and of hardy - littlewood @xcite at the beginning of the last century . in a pioneering work",
    "@xcite maslanka obtained a regularized expansion for the zeta function ( with coefficients @xmath9 ) and baez - duarte for the expansion of the reciprocal of the zeta function ( with coefficients @xmath10 ) for the riesz case @xcite .",
    "other cases of interest have also recently been studied @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , the discrete version by means of the pochhammer s polynomials @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the complex variable and _ k _ is an integer , has advantages especially in the context of numerical experiments in connection with some `` kind of verification '' in the direction to believe that the rh may be true .    in this work",
    "we first derive a new expansion for the zeta function in terms of the pochhammer s polynomials via the alternating series ( with new coefficients @xmath0 ) . in some formal limit",
    ", a connection with the expansion of maslanka is also obtained in section 2 .",
    "our expansion is then studied numerically on the critical line where a good agreement with the real function is obtained up to @xmath13 , with the emergence of the first few low zeros .",
    "after this value of _ t _ , a divergence possibly of numerical nature set on .    in section 3",
    "we then obtain the expansion for the function @xmath14 ( with new coefficients @xmath1 ) as well for the derivative of @xmath6 ( with new coefficients @xmath5 ) in terms of the two parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 , already introduced in our previous works @xcite then the critical function for the derivative ( whose boundedness at large _ k _",
    "would ensure the truth of the rh ) is then obtained either with the primes or with the trivial and non - trivial zeros of the zeta function .    in a numerical experiment for the special case @xmath17 and @xmath18 up to high values of _ k _ , i.e. @xmath8 , the results for the two functions are in very good agreement , both with the emergence of the same twelve oscillations of stable amplitude of about 0.01 ( section 4 ) .    finally , in the limit of large @xmath16 and @xmath19 , it is argued that an upper bound to the critical function should be given by the euler constant gamma ( section 5 ) .",
    "in this section we derive a formula for @xmath20 similar to the one of maslanka @xcite for @xmath21 and of baez - duarte @xcite for @xmath22}^{-1}$ ] .    here",
    "the starting series is convergent for @xmath23 and the formula is obtained still in terms of the so called pochhammer s polynomials of degree _ k _ , in the complex variable @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath24    we will also use a family of functions with two parameters ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) as considered already in our recent works @xcite . since the alternating series is given by : @xmath25    we have using the trick as in @xcite that : @xmath26    since @xmath27    we obtain : @xmath28    since from ( 2.2 ) @xmath29    substitution in ( 2.3 ) gives : @xmath30    with the definition @xmath31    ( 2.4 ) becomes : @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the series above , is expected to represent @xmath35 for _ s _ in some compact subset of the plane as for the maslanka case @xcite . in that case , the central point has been investigated and elucidated by baez - duarte @xcite . here",
    "many choices of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are possible .",
    "for @xmath36 we have the riesz case @xcite and it is the analogon to the regularized version of maslanka but the representation of the zeta function is not the same . for @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "we obtain the hardy - littlewood case @xcite which was also discussed numerically in a different way using other polynomials @xcite .",
    "in fact , from lemma 2.3 of baez - duarte @xcite which states that at large _ k _ : @xmath39    where c is a constant depending on @xmath40s@xmath40 ,    we obtain here that : @xmath41    we thus suspect and expect that the above series represents @xmath42 for all @xmath43 if we assume @xmath44 with @xmath45 at large values of _ k _ and for some constant _ d. _ in fact with this assumption we have that : @xmath46    if @xmath47 .    for @xmath48 ( riesz ) we should have @xmath49 . for the case @xmath19 and @xmath38 ( hardy - littlewood ) we should have @xmath50 .",
    "another case of interest is the one where @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this case one",
    "should have @xmath53 .     of interest also , is the limiting case of large values of @xmath16 , where barely @xmath0 should behave as @xmath54 .    for",
    "a strong argument ( a theorem ) in favour of the validity of the maslanka representation of @xmath21 in some regions of the complex plane ( compact subsets ) , the reader should consult the works of baez - duarte @xcite already mentionned and it is expected that using the same methods , the proof of ( 2.6 ) may be obtained for all @xmath55 . here , for our series we limit ourselves to a numerical analysis just illustrating the kind of accuracy of some representations .    _",
    "remark_. let us consider the riesz case @xmath36 .",
    "we can write : @xmath56    and using the taylor s expansion of @xmath57",
    ", we obtain : @xmath58    where @xmath59    i.e. the representation obtained originally by a different method by maslanka in a pioneering work @xcite .",
    "we remark that ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) should not be considered as an approximation of our formulas ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) and vice versa .",
    "( 2.5 ) , ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.8 ) , ( 2.9 ) are simply two different representations of functions related to the riemann zeta function , the first one given by @xmath60 , the second one by @xmath20 .    as an example , for @xmath61 with @xmath62 in @xmath63 $ ] , both representations give a good description of the real function @xmath64 as may easily be computationally checked .",
    "we now proceed to obtain a representation of @xmath65 possibly correct on the critical line @xmath66 , with the help of ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) , in which we are free to set @xmath67 and @xmath68 . then : @xmath69    where now @xmath70",
    "we now check the series in ( 2.10 ) restricting _ k _ up to 20 for @xmath71 and up to 50 for @xmath72 .",
    "we compare the result with the exact functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for @xmath66 with _ t _ up to 40 .",
    "the plots are given below .",
    "we obtain a good approximation with the emergence of the first five non - trivial zeros located at @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the numerical results are satisfactory until @xmath80 .",
    "[ red ] vs. @xmath81 [ black ] ]     [ red ] vs. @xmath82 [ black ] ]    this concludes the first part of our work .",
    "below , in the second part we develop two new representations of the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 which may possibly constitute a satisfactory approximation to the exact functions .",
    "we will start as before but instead of writing @xmath65 as a sum , i.e. @xmath85 , we will use the euler product formula to derive a new representation for @xmath86 , which of course should be carefully investigated by means of some numerical experiments .",
    "thus : @xmath87 = \\ln [ \\left ( 1 - 2^{1-s}\\right ) \\prod \\limits_{p\\,\\mathrm{prime}}\\frac{1}{1-p^{-s } } ] \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",

    ", we have : @xmath88    so that introducing the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 as before we have that : @xmath89    the same treatment for the function @xmath90 , gives : @xmath91    where @xmath92 are still the pochhammer s polynomials .",
    "finally , the representation of @xmath86 , we propose is given by : @xmath87 = \\sum \\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty } d_{k}p_{k } ( \\frac{s-\\alpha } { \\beta } + 1)\\ ] ]    where now : @xmath93\\ ] ]    _ remark_. another formal derivation of the above equations is the following : @xmath87 = \\ln \\left [ \\sum \\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{{\\left ( -1\\right ) } ^{n-1}}{n^{s}}\\right]\\ ] ]    supposing now that the right hand side may be given as an unknown series @xmath94 we then have : @xmath95    which coincide with ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) , obtained with the euler product formula for @xmath96 .",
    "( 3.2 ) with ( 3.3 ) , is the new formula possibly representing the logarithm of the zeta function in terms of the two parameters pochhammer s polynomials . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the above representation is new and it is our aim to carry out some numerical experiments in the sequel in order to support its validity also in some compact subset of the critical strip .",
    "we now investigate the representation of the derivative of the function @xmath97 : @xmath98    then with @xmath99 we obtain : @xmath100    introducing as above the pochhammer s polynomials we obtain further : @xmath101    for @xmath102 , using @xmath102=@xmath103 we have similarly : @xmath104    thus , along these lines we obtain : @xmath105    where : @xmath106\\ ] ]    from the formula ( 7 ) in @xcite , where @xmath107 represents a non - trivial zero of the zeta function , i.e. : @xmath108    setting @xmath109 , this equation applied to @xmath110 in ( 3.6 ) gives :",
    "@xmath111    we consider only @xmath112 . now we make the variable change @xmath113 and finally we obtain : @xmath114    where @xmath115 is the beta function .",
    "thus for large _",
    "k _ we can write : @xmath116    for the critical function @xcite corresponding to @xmath117 we have an analogous expression to the baez - duarte formula for the @xmath10 appearing in the expansion of @xmath118 @xcite : @xmath119    on the other hand we can express @xmath2 and then the critical function with a second formula : @xmath120 @xmath121    in fact ( see above ) the pochhammer expansion for @xmath102 is : @xmath122    where @xmath123    which for large _ k _ behaves as @xmath124 . indeed with the substitution @xmath125 we obtain : @xmath126    it is interesting to note that one can express the critical function in terms of the zeros of the zeta function ( 3.8 ) or in terms of the primes ( 3.10 ) .",
    "we will investigate numerically these two functions for the case @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath127 .",
    "as a test of the goodness of ( 3.2 ) we draw in figure 3 the plots of the function @xmath128 and of its polynomial representation in the interval @xmath129 .",
    "figure 3 shows a good match between them also in the `` critical real interval '' @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "[ black ] and its polynomial representation [ red ]  ]    in the next figures we present the results of the numerical experiment performed on our representation ( 3.5 ) for the case @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we calculated the critical functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 for @xmath132 . in our calculations we considered only the first 10 non - trivial zeros of the zeta function , the first 20 trivial ones and the first 5000 primes . furthermore using the usual substitution @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath131",
    "become :   @xmath135    where @xmath136 is the imaginary part of the _ j_-_th _ non - trivial zero .",
    "we argue @xmath131 should approach @xmath130 .",
    "the convergence is surprising .",
    "the computations presented in figure 4 and figure 5 indicate that the qualitative and quantitative agreement between the two functions is very good in the range @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) .      calculated with the zeros of the zeta function ]     calculated with the primes ]    it is interesting to study the single contribution of a prime to the critical function @xmath131 . in figure 6",
    "we computed the contributions of the 10th prime ( @xmath139 ) , of the 50th prime ( @xmath140 ) and of the 100th prime ( @xmath141 ) , all the calculations were performed until @xmath142 .",
    "the computations indicate that not only the contributions decrease with increasing _",
    "p _ but also that great primes have an influence only on big values of _",
    "k_.      of the primes @xmath139 [ black ] , @xmath140 [ red ] and @xmath141 [ green ] ]",
    "in a numerical context we are also interested in the case of large @xmath16 values .",
    "we start with the equation ( 7 ) in @xcite , given by : @xmath143    and we set @xmath144 .",
    "then , using the formula @xmath145 as above ( @xmath146 ) , we obtain : @xmath147    where @xmath148    we now analyze @xmath149 , the absolute value of the critical function , at large @xmath16 values where @xmath150 is valid .",

    "if we choose @xmath19 , ( 5.4 ) would become in the @xmath16 limit ( supposing that this limit may be performed and has a meaning ) : @xmath154    where @xmath155 is the euler constant ( see also @xcite ) .    if such a limit is permitted our conjecture",
    "is that for @xmath156 , as @xmath157 : @xmath158    where _ b _ is some constant and @xmath159 .    since from the definition @xmath160 we obtain : @xmath161    then applying the baez - duarte inequality , i.e. @xmath162 we have for @xmath156 that : @xmath163    and finally : @xmath164    a similar ( of course not rigorous ) limit is formally obtained for @xmath165 using the primes along the lines for ( 3.4 ) to ( 3.10 ) , which , as @xmath16@xmath166@xmath167 is given by : @xmath168    and thus @xcite : @xmath169    we carried out some numerical experiments restricted to large @xmath16 values ( until @xmath170 ) , using the first 3600 known zeros @xcite . the computations in figure 7 indicate that for a fixed _ k _ , within the limit of accuracy of our computations , the difference between ( 5.4 ) and @xmath171 approximately stabilizes to less than 0.001 indipendently from the choice of _ k_. the difference is largely due only to the term involving the non - trivial zeros .",
    "that is if we need a higher precision we have to consider more non - trivial zeros in ( 5.4 ) .",
    "of @xmath149 for @xmath172",

    "we have then carried out a numerical experiment which gives a very satisfactory agreements between the two , which up to very high values of _ k _ remain bounded .",
