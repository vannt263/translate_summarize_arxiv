    "sociophysics is based on the use of concepts and tools from physics to describe social and political behavior @xcite .",
    "while the validity of such a transfer has been long questioned among physicists @xcite , none ever has expected that some basic sociophysics question may in turn lead to new development within physics . in this paper",
    "we report , to our knowledge for the first time , on such a development .",
    "indeed economics long ago has contributed substantially to statistical physics , but indirectly , providing several tools it developed on its own , which were then taken over by physics @xcite .",
    "opinion dynamics has been a very active field of research among physicists in the recent years @xcite .",
    "most models are based on some local update rule and corresponding results are obtained using numerical simulations @xcite . the sznajd model initiated in 2000",
    "@xcite is the most popular and has generated a great deal of papers @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "a much older one proposed by galam in 1986 @xcite , has stayed confined to only few works @xcite .",
    "but a recent universal scheme for local rules shows that both models have the same dynamics @xcite prompting the question of why they have been perceived as different with an advantage for the first one .",
    "indeed , the reason lies in the fact that , although the galam model is solvable analytically , its very formulation has been perceived as the signature of an intrinsic mean field nature . since its dynamics is monitored by a total reshuffling of agents between repeated local updates , in principle everybody can interact to everybody .",
    "this fact has been understood as everybody does interact to everybody simultaneously , as in a mean field treatment @xcite .",
    "however that is not the case due to the local range of interactions which are restricted to separate small groups of agents after each reshuffling .",
    "at least , for years , galam was adamant in claiming it .    in this work",
    "we address this question by a thorough numerical monte carlo investigation of the effect of reshuffling spins on the phase diagram of the two - dimensional nearest neighbor ( nn ) ising model @xcite .",
    "reshuffling is introduced gradually according to the variable @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the probability of reshuffling all the spins of the lattice at each monte carlo step .",
    "we call it the gradually reshuffled ising model and denote it by grim",
    ". it is worth to stress that after each spin reshuffling , interactions stay local among nn .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath6 is calculated for a series of values of @xmath5 from @xmath14 ( square lattice ising model  slim ) up to @xmath7 ( totally reshuffled ising model  trim ) .",
    "binder s cumulant for @xmath6 evaluation is used to avoid finite size effect @xcite .",
    "as expected , at @xmath14 the slim exact value @xmath15 $ ] is recovered .",
    "the variation of the grim @xmath6 as function of @xmath5 is found to exhibit a non - linear behavior .",
    "a similar study of gradual reshuffling was performed for galam opinion model in the case of local groups of size four @xcite .    the unifying galam scheme @xcite is then used to map the trim into a local rule model where update groups are of a size five .",
    "its allows an analytical calculation of the critical temperature @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to the simulations , it is found to depend on the choice of the dynamics .",
    "metropolis and glauber yield different values , respectively @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "last one reproduces almost exactly the monte carlo result at @xmath7 , @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the simplest realization @xcite of the solomon network ( sn ) @xcite is noted to reproduce trim results .",
    "similarly to the critical temperature , critical exponents are found to differ from both , the slim case and the mean field values .",
    "concluding remarks with respect to future work end the paper .",
    "we consider the nearest neighbor ising model @xcite on a square lattice with ferromagnetic interactions @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ising spin variable at each node @xmath21 of the square lattice and @xmath22 is short - range ferromagnetic exchange integral .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed using either a glauber or a metropolis dynamics . in the glauber dynamics ,",

    "the value of the critical temperature @xmath6 is extracted from the evaluation of the order parameter @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 . in a second step , to get a more precise estimate of @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit , we calculate binder s fourth cumulant of the order parameter defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 represent the thermal average ( taken over 400000 mcs after discarding 100000 mcs for equilibration at each temperature ) .",
    "this cumulant should go to @xmath36 below @xmath6 and to zero above @xmath6 when the size increases , and the finite - size estimates are expected to cross around @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "in every mcs , before updating all spins , with a probability @xmath5 the reshuffling procedure takes place : random permutation of all spin labels is produced and their positions are rearranged according to that new labels order . with probability @xmath40 , all spins keep their current position .",
