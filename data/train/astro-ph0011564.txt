    "seven soft sources , _ the magnificent seven _ , have been found in rosat fields which are most probably associated with isolated radio - quiet nss .",
    "a summary of their main observational properties is reported in the table ( see e.g. nehauser & trmper @xcite , nt99 ; motch @xcite ; treves et al .",
    "@xcite , t2000 , and references therein ; see also burwitz et al . at this conference ) .",
    "[ table1 ]    .properties of rosat isolated ns candidates [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     present x - ray and optical data however do not allow an unambiguous identification of the physical mechanism responsible for their emission .",
    "these sources can be powered either by accretion of the interstellar gas onto old ( @xmath11 yr ) nss or by the release of internal energy in relatively young ( @xmath12 yr ) cooling nss ( t2000 for a recent review ) . the rosat candidates , although relatively bright ( up to @xmath13 ) , are intrinsically dim and their inferred luminosity ( @xmath14 ) is near to that expected from either a close - by cooling ns or from an accreting ns among the most luminous .",
    "their x - ray spectrum is soft and thermal , again as predicted for both accretors and coolers ( t2000 ) . up to now",
    "only two optical counterparts have been identified : rxj 1856 - 37 , walter & matthews ( @xcite ) , for which a distance estimate of @xmath15 pc has been very recently obtained , and rxj 0720 - 31 , kulkarni & van kerkwick ( @xcite ) . in both cases an optical excess over the low - frequency tail of the black body x - ray spectrum has been reported .    a statistical approach , based on the comparison of the predicted and observed source counts may provide useful informations on the nature of these objects .",
    "previous studies derived the @xmath16  @xmath17 distribution of accretors ( treves & colpi @xcite ; madau & blaes @xcite ; manning et al .",
    "@xcite ) assuming a nss velocity distribution rich in slow stars ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "recent measurements of pulsar velocities ( e.g. lyne & lorimer @xcite ; hansen & phinney @xcite ) and upper limits on the observed number of accretors in rosat surveys ( danner @xcite ) point , however , to a larger ns mean velocity ( t2000 ) .",
    "nehauser & trmper ( nt99 ) compared the number count distribution of the rosat isolated ns candidates with those of accretors and coolers . here",
    "we address these issues in greater detail , in the light of the latest contributions to the modeling of the evolution of galactic nss ( popov et al .",
    "@xcite , p2000a ) .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion can be found in popov et al .",
    "( @xcite , p2000b ) .",
    "an important feature of our approach is the detailed calculation of the magneto - rotational evolution of isolated nss , calculated as in p2000a ( see lipunov @xcite for the basic concepts ) , but with slightly revised values for the critical periods governing the ejector - propeller and propeller - accretor transitions .",
    "when the accretor stage is reached , the ns spin period is set equal to the `` equilibrium '' period ( konenkov & popov @xcite ) .",
    "the form of the galactic potential is taken as in paczynski ( @xcite ; see also p2000a ) ; some parameters were upgraded in order to fit better solar distance from the galactic center ( see madau and blaes @xcite ) .",
    "initially each ns has a circular velocity corresponding to its birthplace , and an additional kick velocity , selected from a maxwellian distribution , is added .",
    "nss are assumed to be born in the galactic plane and their birthrate is constant in time and proportional to the the square of the local gas density .",
    "the ns magnetic field is taken to follow a log - gaussian distribution .",
    "for each evolutionary track we calculate six different magneto - rotational histories , corresponding to different values of the initial magnetic field .",
    "results were then merged and normalized .",
    "the total number of nss in the galaxy is taken @xmath19 .    in order to compare theoretical predictions with observations",
    "it is useful to produce the @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 distribution .",
    "the brightest accretors in our calculations have luminosities @xmath20 erg s@xmath5 , but the majority of them cluster around @xmath21 erg s@xmath5 . to compare our results with observations of rosat sources a conversion factor @xmath22",
    "was used ( e.g. nt99 ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 distribution for the frequency intergrated flux ( @xmath23 , here @xmath24 is the source distance , @xmath25 ) and for the flux in the range 0.5 - 2 kev . in latter case",
    "the spectrum is assumed to be a blackbody and the polar cap radius is calculated with the current values of the magnetic field and accretion rate ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the alfven radius ) . if absorption is negligible , then one expects about 1 source per square degree in the range 0.5 - 2 kev for limiting fluxes about @xmath3@xmath28 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "this should be compared with a total numer of sources presently detected by chandra of @xmath29@xmath30 ( see e.g. giacconi at this conference ) .",
    "results are presented in the figure .",
    "although in principle the evolution of coolers should be computed exactly in the same way as for accretors , they are much more short - lived and hence less numerous .",
    "this poses a severe problem about the reliability of our sample which is based on a limited number of evolutionary tracks .",
    "this can be avoided exploiting the fact that coolers are a local population of sources .",
    "we assume that nss are uniformly distributed in the disk with half - thickness of 450 pc .",
    "the nss spatial density is a free parameter and can be varied .",
    "we used two values , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the first value corresponds to the density adopted by nt99 , and comes from radiopulsars statistics .",
    "the second one corresponds to @xmath33 and is suggested by considerations on supernova nucleosynthetic yields ( e.g. arnett et al .",
    "these two values can be compared , for example , with @xmath34pc@xmath35 as derived by paczynski ( @xcite ) .",
    "all nss are assumed to be `` standard candles '' with @xmath36 erg s@xmath5 and blackbody spectrum .",
    "the duration of the cooling phase was taken to be @xmath37 yrs , as suggested by the slow cooling scenario . in the fast cooling model ( e.g. yakovlev et al .",
    "@xcite ) the number of observable coolers should be much smaller , so , potentially , observations of isolated nss may help in shedding light on their cooling history .",
    "the ism structure is treated in a very simple way : a spherical local bubble of radius @xmath38 ( which can be varied ) and density @xmath39 cm@xmath35 centered at the sun and a uniform medium with density @xmath41 cm@xmath35 in the galactic disc ( with scaleheight 450 pc ) at larger distances .",
    "after the column density @xmath42 is calculated , we compute the source count rate for given luminosity , temperature and column density .",
    "results are shown in the figure .",
    "= 0.6    this simple model reproduces a key feature : the flattening of the @xmath16 @xmath17 distribution outside the local bubble , which is important to explain rosat data at large fluxes .",
    "more sophisticated models with a realistic distribution of both the ism and the coolers give nearly the same results , and will be presented in a separate paper . in the actual calculation we took @xmath43",
    "pc ( equal to the radius of the local bubble in our calculations for accretors , see also sfeir et al .",
    "a clear knee appears due to the effect of absorption .",
    "such strong flattening can help to explain the observed data , if one assumes that the the vast majority of bright ( @xmath44 count s@xmath5 ) isolated nss are already identified .",
    "the position of the knee can be adjusted varying @xmath38 , @xmath45 and the ism density ; for smaller values of @xmath38 the knee moves to the right , towards higher count rates . by taking a high enough spatial density of nss",
    "these results are able to account for both : i ) the number of bright sources , and ii ) the flattening of the observed @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 distribution .",
    "the task of explaining the observed properties of the seven rosat isolated ns candidates within a single model based on standard assumptions is not easy .",
    "the rosat sources are in fact : i ) relatively bright , @xmath46 count s@xmath5 ; ii ) close , @xmath47 ; iii ) soft , @xmath48 ev ; iv ) slowly rotating , for rx j0720 , rx j0420 and rbs1223 the periods are about 520 s.    the accretion stage can be reached only if ns magnetic field is @xmath49@xmath1 g. for polar cap accretion the x - ray spectrum is then relatively hard with a typical temperature around 300 - 400 ev . for them",
    "interstellar absorption is not very significant , and we predict about 1 source per square degree for fluxes about @xmath28@xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 for energy range 0.5 - 2 kev . while accretors may indeed represent the bulk of a still undetected low - luminosty population of x - ray sources , it is difficult to reconcile them with the relatively bright rosat sources , as shown in the figure . on the contrary ,",
    "the number distribution of coolers is in agreement with that of the seven isolated ns sources discovered so far , only if the total number of young close - by nss is a factor @xmath10 larger than what implied by radiopulsar statistics",
    ". taken at face value , this implies that the majority of nss do not experience an active radiopulsar phase , a major implication which is also supported by other evidences ( see e.g. gotthelf & vasisht @xcite ) . the interpretation of the observed periods of some of the magnificent seven remains problematic and seems to require special conditions on the evolution of the magnetic field and spin .",
