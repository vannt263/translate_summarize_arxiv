    "circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite has quickly developed in the last decade and is now one of the most promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum computers @xcite and quantum simulators @xcite due to , among other reasons , the high level of controlability and scalability that can be achieved . in circuit qed",
    "both superconducting qubits and electromagnetic radiation can be controlled and manipulated to an extent that goes beyond some of the standard restrictions in other platforms of quantum optics and quantum information .",
    "an important area in quantum technologies is devoted to the emergent field of quantum metrology @xcite which aims at improving the precision of measurement devices by exploiting quantum features such as entanglement and squeezing in phase estimation protocols .",
    "applications are critical and diverse , ranging from the use of squeezed states in gravitational wave detection with laser interferometers @xcite to the notion of a global network of quantum clocks @xcite , among many others .    in this work",
    "we propose a scheme for quantum estimation in circuit qed .",
    "we consider a superconducting transmission line interrupted by a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) .",
    "this technology resembles the one employed in the observation of the dynamical casimir effect @xcite .",
    "however , instead of an initial vacuum we consider the preparation of more general initial states- in particular thermal two - mode squeezed states- by means of an additional transmission line .",
    "the modulation of the squid transforms this initial state in such a way that it becomes dependent on the parameters of the modulating magnetic field .",
    "thus the parameters of the magnetic field can be estimated by means of phase estimation techniques .",
    "we compute the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and maximize it over the set of considered states in order to determine the optimal initial estate for quantum estimation . in order to maximise as well the number of independent measurements and accordingly the precision , instead of considering a single superconducting resonator",
    "we propose the use of a large array of non - interacting cavities @xcite .",
    "we show that good precision can be achieved for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "we discuss possible applications of these results , which include accurate frequency measurements or highly precise measurements of magnetic flux variations threading the squid .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we introduce our model and show how to maximize the qfi of the electromagnetic field state confined within a single superconducting resonator . in section 3 we show how these results enable the use of an array of resonators for quantum estimation , discussing some potential applications .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a summary of our results",
    "we will consider a large array of superconducting resonators @xcite consisting of superconducting waveguides terminated by squids @xcite with mutual interactions controlled by additional squids @xcite . as we will see in detail below",
    "we want to achieve a large number of independent measurements of a particular quantum state of the electromagnetic field . to this end",
    ", the squids can be tuned in a such a way that the resonators are non - interacting @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can focus in the dynamics of a single superconducting waveguide as we will do in the following .    in order to exploit squeezing and entanglement we consider the preparation of a two - mode squeezed state as initial state .",
    "this can be achieved by connecting the transmission line to an auxiliary line terminated by an array of three squids which provide a kerr medium that can be used as a parametric amplifier -this has been used to experimentally generate two - mode squeezed states within a single transmission line @xcite .",
    "we consider as well a non - zero small temperature characterized by a small number of thermal photons @xmath0",
    ".    we will describe the field dynamics by means of the covariance matrix @xmath1 . using the same convention as in @xcite , which assumes zero displacement without any loss of generality , we have @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a vector with the quadratures as elements : @xmath4 and @xmath5 given in terms of the creation @xmath6 and annihilation @xmath7 operators of the two modes of interest @xmath8 .",
    "the initial state is then described by the covariance matrix of a thermal two - mode squeezed state : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 define the complex squeezing parameter @xmath12 and @xmath13 are standard pauli matrices .",
    "+ the aim now is to transform this initial state under the parametric amplification process induced by the modulation of the squid that terminates the waveguide .",
    "if we add a weak harmonic drive to the squid characterized by a frequency @xmath14 and a normalised amplitude @xmath15 , then the field quadratures are transformed as follows @xcite : @xmath16 , @xmath17 where the small parameter @xmath18 is : @xmath19 @xmath20 is an effective length that describes the boundary conditions that the squid provides to the flux field while v is the speed of light along the waveguide .",
    "we are assuming that the frequencies of the modes are very close @xmath21 .    under this transformation and considering only up to linear terms in @xmath22 and up to quadratic terms in @xmath18 we obtain the transformed covariance matrix v of the state : @xmath23\\sigma_x.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "our main aim is to analyze the sensitivity of the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) with respect to the parameter @xmath18 . in order to achieve this goal we consider the qfi , which provides a bound on the error of the estimation of the parameter .",
    "therefore , we will seek to maximize the qfi .",
    "first , let us analyze the case in which we try to estimate the parameter by means of measurements over only one mode .",
    "therefore , we consider the reduced single - mode covariance matrix , that is @xmath24 .",
    "the qfi for estimation of a parameter @xmath25 using a single - mode gaussian state @xmath26 is given in @xcite and for zero displacement reduces to : @xmath27}{1 + p(\\tau)^{2 } } + 2\\dfrac{p'(\\tau)^{2}}{1 - p(\\tau)^{4 } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where p = @xmath28 is the purity of the state and @xmath29 stands for the determinant of a matrix . in our case",
    "@xmath26 is the reduced matrix  .",
    "the prime indicates a derivative with respect to the parameter @xmath25 ( e.g. @xmath30 ) . for our purposes",
    "this parameter will be @xmath18 .",
    "vs. @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the qfi is maximized at @xmath33 and @xmath34 and grows monotonically with @xmath10 . ]    in fig .",
    "( [ fig:0 ] ) we plot @xmath35 with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , using realistic experimental parameters @xmath36-which corresponds to a temperature @xmath37- , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we find that the qfi oscillates with @xmath11 in such a way that the maximum is reached at @xmath41 while the minimum is at @xmath42 .",
    "the qfi grows significantly with the value of the squeezing parameter @xmath10 -as expected- which in the figure is plotted in a realistic range @xmath43 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) we choose the optimal value @xmath44 and plot the single - mode qfi vs. @xmath10 and @xmath18 .",
    "we see that the qfi slightly decreases with @xmath18 , while the growth of the qfi with @xmath10 is observed at any value of @xmath18 .",
    "vs @xmath10 and @xmath18 for @xmath45 and the optimal value @xmath46 .",
    "the qfi slightly diminishes with @xmath18 and grows dramatically with @xmath10 . ]",
    "we have also found that the qfi is highly insensitive to the value of @xmath22 within the perturbative regime that we are considering here .",
    "now we analyze the case in which the full two - mode covariance matrix is used for the estimation protocol .",
    "the two - mode qfi @xmath47 with respect to a parameter @xmath25 can be computed by means of the uhlmann fidelity in the following way @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the uhlmann fidelity given by @xcite : @xmath50 and where @xmath51 , \\lambda = 16\\operatorname{det}[(\\text{\\~{v}}_1 + i\\omega)/2]\\operatorname{det}[(\\text{\\~{v}}_2 + i\\omega)/2 ] , \\upsilon = \\operatorname{det}[(\\text{\\~{v}}_1 + \\text{\\~{v}}_2)/2]$ ] @xmath52 being the symplectic form @xmath53 , and the covariance matrices v@xmath54 and",
    "v@xmath55 only differ in an infinitesimal variation of the parameter of interest , that is v@xmath54 depends on @xmath25 while v@xmath55 depends on @xmath56 .",
    "thus , in our case , v@xmath54 is given by eq.([eq : state ] ) and v@xmath55 is obtained by replacing @xmath18 by @xmath57 .",
    "putting all together we are able to find a simple analytical expression for the leading order in perturbation theory of the two - mode qfi : @xmath58\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig.[fig:2 ] we plot this two - mode qfi vs r and @xmath11 for the same parameters as in [ fig:0 ] .",
    "we see that the qfi for the optimal parameters is three orders of magnitude larger than the best scenario in the single - mode case .",
    "the qfi oscillates with @xmath11 , but in this case @xmath42 are the optimal values .",
    "as expected , the qfi grows drastically with @xmath10 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : n ] and [ fig:3 ] we see that the qfi is almost independent of the value of @xmath18 and slightly decreases with @xmath22 -in both cases for the optimal value of @xmath11 .     vs. @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath45 and @xmath32 .",
    "the optimal values are @xmath59 and @xmath60 while the qfi grows monotonically with @xmath10 .",
    "the qfi is three orders of magnitude larger than the single - mode case . ]     vs. @xmath10 and @xmath22 for the optimal value @xmath61 and @xmath32 .",
    "we see that thermal noise slightly degrades the qfi . ]     vs. @xmath10 and @xmath18 for the optimal value @xmath61 and the experimental one @xmath45 -corresponding to @xmath62.the qfi is highly insensitive to the value of @xmath18 while grows significantly with @xmath10 . ]    in summary , the strategy to maximize the qfi would be to consider the joint two - mode state , to choose an optimal value of @xmath63 and to achieve a squeezing parameter @xmath10 as large as possible given the experimental limitations .    in the next section",
    ", we will see how all the above is related with the error in the measurement of physical magnitudes .",
    "the relation between the optimal uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath18 and the qfi is governed by the quantum cramer - rao bound @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of independent measurements performed on the state .",
    "there always exists an optimal measurement strategy that saturates the bound .    in the previous section ,",
    "we have analyzed how to maximize the qfi . in the following",
    "we discuss how to maximize the number of measurements .    to this end we consider a large array of superconducting resonators @xcite in which additional squids control the interaction between each resonator @xcite . in particular",
    ", these squids can be tuned in order to switch off the coupling @xcite and to obtain a lattice of non - interacting resonators .",
    "thus we can assume that we have a large number of copies of the same individual superconducting resonator .",
    "in this way , we can use a large number @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cramerrao ] ) in order to mimimize the error . in particular , a number of @xmath66 resonators seems to be within reach of current technology @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figuremeasure ] we show the number of measurements required to achieve a relative error @xmath67 for different values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath18 . we see that for large enough values of @xmath10 , @xmath65 can be comparable to the desired reference value @xmath66 , although the number grows for the lowest values of @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig : err ] we plot @xmath68 vs. @xmath10 and @xmath18 assuming @xmath69 , showing that @xmath68 can be extremely small for the largest values of @xmath10",
    ".     needed to achieve a relative error @xmath70 in the estimation of @xmath18 vs. @xmath10 , for different values of @xmath18 , @xmath45 and @xmath61.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +   needed to achieve a relative error @xmath70 in the estimation of @xmath18 vs. @xmath10 , for different values of @xmath18 , @xmath45 and @xmath61.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +   needed to achieve a relative error @xmath70 in the estimation of @xmath18 vs. @xmath10 , for different values of @xmath18 , @xmath45 and @xmath61.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    ) for different values of @xmath10 and @xmath18 assuming @xmath69 , @xmath45 and @xmath61 . ]",
    "the above results show that we can estimate with high precision the value of @xmath18 , that is the degree of additional squeezing introduced by the parametric amplification .",
    "perhaps more interestingly from the physical viewpoint , notice that @xmath18 is a product of several physical magnitudes @xmath14 , @xmath71 and @xmath20 - eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "thus we can relate the uncertainty in the estimation of f with their respective uncertainties via the standard error propagation formula : @xmath72 where in the last line we have already used eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) . assuming that we can consider the scenario in which we have good control over all the variables but one -for instance , by means of a careful calibration process so that we can account for the uncertainties in the other variables as systematic errors- then we have that : @xmath73 -where we are denoting by @xmath74 the mentioned magnitude of interest .",
    "that is , the relative error in the estimation of @xmath18 is equal to the relative error in the estimation of @xmath74 .",
    "since we have already shown that we are able to achieve very high precision in the estimation of @xmath18 , this entails that the same conclusion can be extended to the estimation of @xmath14 , @xmath71 and @xmath20 -provided that it is possible to realise an experimental scenario in which we have control over all the variables but one .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 can be related to the magnetic flux threading the squid .",
    "indeed , the effective length is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath77 the inductance per unit length of the superconducting waveguide and @xmath78 the flux - dependent josephson energy of the squid , given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the squid critical current and @xmath81 the external magnetic flux . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : effec ] ) and ( [ eq : joseph ] ) and using an error propagation formula similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : relativeerr ] ) we find : @xmath82 in the experiments , @xmath83 and thus we find that @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , a precise estimation of @xmath18 entails a precise estimation of the magnetic flux .",
    "of course , highly accurate and sensitive magnetometers are already available and indeed squids are well - known as ultrasensitive magnetometers . a thorough investigation on whether our quantum metrology techniques can actually improve on the current state of the art lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we have shown that quantum metrology tools can be used to estimate physical variables in a circuit qed scenario . in particular , we have considered a superconducting waveguide interrupted by a squid , where modulation of the magnetic field which threads the squid acts as a parametric amplifier .",
    "we start from a thermal two - mode squeezed state where the squeezing is characterized by the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we find the optimal parameters that maximize the qfi and therefore the initial state which is more suitable for quantum phase estimation .",
    "after computing both the qfi of the full state and the reduced single - mode state , we conclude that the best strategy is to consider the full two - mode state where the initial parameters are @xmath63 and @xmath10 as large as allowed by the experimental limitations . in order to achieve a large number of independent measurements , we propose to use a large array of superconducting waveguides , where additional squids control the interaction strength in order to ensure a large number of non - interacting superconducting resonators , providing copies of the single - resonator system .",
    "we show that the combination of large qfi and large independent measurements enables a precise estimation of the parameter @xmath18 , which characterizes the process of parametric amplification .",
    "this can be used for a precise estimation of the physical magnitudes involved in the definition of @xmath18 , for instance the magnetic flux threading the squid .",
