    "turbulent convection is one of the best studied fundamental flows in fluid dynamics research @xcite .",
    "one reason is the large range of examples and applications in nature and technology for which a turbulent motion is initiated and sustained by heating a fluid from below and cooling from above .",
    "almost all of these studies have been conducted in the eulerian frame of reference .",
    "they were primarily focussed to the mechanisms of local @xcite and global @xcite turbulent heat transfer .",
    "the lagrangian perspective of turbulence , in which the fields are monitored along the trajectories of infinitesimal fluid parcels , has recently produced new insights into the local topology of fluid parcel tracks , the local strength of accelerations , and the statistics of time increments of turbulent fields @xcite .",
    "the progress is caused on the one hand by significant innovations in the experimental techniques , such as three - dimensional particle tracking @xcite or acoustic methods @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , direct numerical simulations of turbulence become now feasible that resolve three - dimensional lagrangian turbulence at moderate and higher reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "both , experiments and simulations , made a deeper understanding of the small - scale intermittency and its connection with large accelerations of fluid parcels possible .",
    "lagrangian investigations in convective turbulence are however rare .",
    "several reasons can be given for this circumstance .",
    "first , on the experimental side it is desirable to monitor the temperature along the particle tracks beside the velocity components and the accelerations . only recently , gasteuil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite constructed therefore a smart particle , that monitors velocity , temperature and orientation while moving through the cell . due to",
    "the integrated power supply the particle diameter remained however larger than the thermal boundary layer thickness , such that the large - scale bulk motion can be monitored only .",
    "second , it is also clear that the complexity of direct numerical simulations increases since the temperature field has to be advected in addition to the velocity",
    ". temperature tracking along the tracer positions requires additional interpolations .",
    "furthermore , one can not return to simulations in a fully periodic cube , the so - called homogeneous rayleigh - bnard convection setup , since the periodicity in the direction of the mean temperature gradient causes a self - amplifying fluid motion .",
    "this was discussed in detail by calzavarini _",
    "third , the turbulence is inhomogeneous at least in the vertical direction as in the following setup and it is thus not clear which of findings from the homogeneous isotropic purely hydrodynamic turbulence pertain .",
    "for example , the height dependence of the statistics has to be considered additionally .",
    "first numerical attempts have been made recently to study some aspects of the heat transfer and tracer dispersion in the lagrangian framework of convective turbulence @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the study can be condensed in one question : which new insight into the nature of turbulent convection provides the complementary lagrangian view ?",
    "one result of @xcite was to determine a mixing zone which is dominated by rising and falling thermal plumes .",
    "this is done by combining acceleration and local convective heat flux statistics .",
    "the mixing zone starts right above the thermal boundary layer and extends several tens of the boundary layer thickness into the bulk of the cell .",
    "thermal plumes are fragments of the thermal boundary layer that detach in the vicinity of the top and bottom isothermal planes .",
    "the existence of a mixing zone has been suggested in several eulerian studies on the basis of other criteria , e.g. @xcite and was thus confirmed in the complementary lagrangian frame of reference @xcite .",
    "the present work extends the previous study @xcite into several directions . beside the local convective",
    ", the local conductive heat flux is studied along the tracer tracks .",
    "it requires to monitor temperature gradient components .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the lagrangian tracer dispersion is extended .",
    "in addition to the hydrodynamic case @xcite , we study the dependence of pair dispersion on the initial separation _ and _ the initial seeding position . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the pure hydrodynamic case , higher order particle statistics requires to track little clusters of tracers .",
    "we provide here an analysis of the four - particle - statistics , where the tracers start out of groups of tetrahedra of different sidelengths and initial vertical positions .",
    "the outline of the manuscript is as follows . in the next section the equations of motion , the numerical scheme , the lagrangian tracer tracking and the turbulent heat transfer . in section iii ,",
    "some results of the eulerian statistics of the temperature field are presented .",
    "this section is followed by sections on the lagrangian particle dispersion , the acceleration statistics and the conductive and convective heat flux .",
    "we conclude with a short discussion of our results and will give a brief outlook to possible extensions of the present work .",
    "the boussinesq equations , i.e. the navier - stokes equations for an incompressible flow with an additional buoyancy term @xmath0 and the advection - diffusion equation for the temperature field , are solved by a standard pseudospectral method for the three - dimensional case @xcite . the equations are given by @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the turbulent velocity field , @xmath3 the ( kinematic ) pressure field and @xmath4 the temperature fluctuation field .",

    "one motivation to study the dispersion in three - dimensional turbulent convection is therefore to verify if the classical richardson dispersion law @xcite can be also observed for the present case .",

    "@xcite , the establishment of a richardson - like regime depends sensitively on the initial separation between the tracers .",
    "indeed , for one of the six different separations the lateral dispersion curve passes through a small plateau with a richardson constant @xmath130 .",
    "this is observed for an initial separation of @xmath131 , ( see solid line in fig . [ fig5](a ) ) .",
    "the re - translation of the proportionality constant @xmath132 into a three - dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence case is obtained by @xmath133 the proportionality constant is smaller than the value @xmath134 for homogeneous isotropic turbulence @xcite . in ref .",

    "the resulting constant is @xmath136 ( see solid line in fig . [",

    "if one combines the lateral and vertical dispersion , the richardson constant for the turbulent convection follows to @xmath137 which is less than our earlier estimate of @xmath138 and @xmath134 .",
    "a smaller richardson constant corresponds with a stronger correlated pair motion .",
    "such behavior can be attributed to the presence of rising and falling thermal plumes - a feature that is absent in isotropic turbulence .",
    "additionally , it is known that the plumes can cluster and form a large scale circulation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5](c ) demonstrates that the vertical dispersion is constrained by the top and bottom planes . the vertical contribution @xmath139 to the pair dispersion levels off .",
    "eventually the lateral dispersion contributes solely to the long - time behavior .",
    "the specifics of the present inhomogeneous flow is that not only the initial pair separation , but also the initial seeding position is important .",
    "this brings us to the second series of particle dispersion studies where tracer pairs with fixed distance in different horizontal planes of the slab are seeded ( see section ii c for details ) and shorter simulations for about half the duration are rerun . figure [ fig6 ] summarizes our findings .",
    "we picked five intial seeding heights : two in the boundary layer , two in the plume mixing zone @xcite and the center plane . while panels ( a ) and ( b ) are for @xmath95 , panels ( c ) and ( d ) are for @xmath128 .",
    "the latter is the separation that yielded a short richardson - like range in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "figures [ fig6](a ) and ( c ) show that the lateral dispersion curves of the tracer subgroups differ in magnitude .",
    "the local slope is however nearly the same for all subsets .",
    "the situation is slightly different for the vertical dispersion : while the seeding in the center plane causes a gradual variation of the local slope of the dispersion curve ( see figs . [",
    "fig6](b ) and ( d ) ) , the seeding in the thermal boundary layer leads to significant differences after the initial ballistic period .",
    "the same result is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) .",
    "the reason is that the tracer pairs probe then the detachment of the boundary layer fragments to full extent .",
    "this is not the case when starting in the bulk of the cell .",
    "it can also be observed that a plateau ( which would imply richardson - like scaling ) depends sensitively on the intial separation and seeding height .    to summarize this part",
    ", richardson - like dispersion appears for a very small range of scales in the present flow .",
    "similar to previous studies , we confirm that the initial pair dispersion depends sensitively on both , the initial pair separation and the initial vertical position of a tracer pair in the volume .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the tracer dispersion in the convection flow is very similar to that in homogeneous isotropic turbulence , given the same range of reynolds numbers .",
    "the specifics of the turbulence , such as the particular driving mechanism or a present inhomogeneity , manifests however in the proportionality constant @xmath107 and causes eventually quantitative deviations from homogeneous isotropic turbulence .",
    "figure [ fig6](c ) illustrates this fact very nicely .",
    "the scatter of the plateaus can be interpreted as a measure of the sensitivity .",
    "the lagrangian statistics of higher - order moments requires to follow more than two lagrangian tracers simultaneously . in the following",
    ", we will focus to the four - particle case .",
    "the tracers are initially seeded at the edges of tetrahedra as discussed in section ii c. the distortion of such a small particle cluster by the turbulence has been studied for the pure hydrodynamic case in refs .",

    "although the scaling behavior of second order moments is sensitive to initial separations and seeding heights , initial separations close to the kolmogorov length result in a short richardson - like scaling range .",
    "interestingly , we reproduce the same long - time limits for the particle cluster shapes as in isotropic turbulence despite turbulent convection is inhomogeneous .",
    "this limit deviates from the gaussian value .",
    "our results suggest that the dispersion laws can be obtained for more complex flows than isotropic homogeneous turbulence .",
    "the proportionality constants are however different which can be attributed to qualitaively different turbulence structures such as thermal plumes in convection .",
    "they affect the vertical dispersion more significantly than the lateral dispersion .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the convective turbulence manifests in less intermittent statistics of the vertical acceleration component compared to the lateral ones .",
    "thermal plumes are not coupled with the strongest accelerations .",
    "we find that the lagrangian nusselt number converges slowly to the eulerian value .",
    "a closer inspection of this point could be done in several steps : first , to disentangle the large - scale circulation from the turbulent background , as done in @xcite , and to combine such a study with a lagrangian analysis .",
    "second , the present study indicates also that the nusselt number relaxes faster with a growing number of tracers , in other words the sampling of joint velocity - temperature statistics improves .",
    "our observation is also related to recent experimental and numerical studies at very large rayleigh numbers @xcite in which the existence and growth of a so - called superconducting core is discussed , which is in line with a decreasing importance of the large flow circulation for growing rayleigh numbers .",
    "a decreasing importance of a coherent large - scale circulation might lead again to a faster convergence @xmath221 .",
