    "muons may cause a substantial background to rare event searches like gerda  ( * * ger**manium * * d**etector * * a**rray ) by generating counts in the region of interest ( roi ) either through direct energy deposition in the detectors or through e.g. decay radiation of spallation products .",
    "the gerda  experiment is searching for the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay of @xmath1ge  @xcite .",
    "the experimental signature of the @xmath0  decay is a peak at @xmath6 , the @xmath7 value of the decay .",
    "gerda  was constructed in the underground laboratory of laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( ) of infn  in italy , which offers an overburden of 3500 meter water equivalent ( m.w.e . ) of rock and hence a reduction of the muon flux by a factor of @xmath810@xmath9 to a rate of @xmath83.4@xmath10/(s@xmath5m@xmath11 ) .",
    "this remaining muon flux however is sufficient to cause a non - negligible background in the region of interest around @xmath6=2039  kev when increasing the sensitivity beyond @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14  yr or when requesting a background index bi@xmath15@xmath16  cts/(kev@xmath5kg@xmath5yr ) .",
    "however , also other analyses profit from the reduced backgrounds ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the origin of muons at  for phase  i of gerda  was twofold .",
    "firstly , the majority of the detectable muons are produced cosmogenically .",
    "spectrum and angular distribution of the muons are both altered by the profile of the rock overburden and have been measured for  with high precision  @xcite .",
    "these muons have an average energy of @xmath17  gev . secondly , a source for muons was the cngs neutrino beam from cern  @xcite which created muons via e.g. @xmath18 reactions in the vicinity of the detector .",
    "this contribution amounted to 2.2% of the total muon flux in gerda .",
    "as the cngs was shut down after 2012 the future phase  ii of gerda  will be unaffected . in order to reduce",
    "muon induced background , a muon veto comprised of a water cherenkov veto and a scintillator veto was implemented to tag muons and to use its response as a veto signal in the @xmath0  analysis .",
    "this paper describes the hardware and setup of the veto and the daq system .",
    "the performance of the veto will be presented and compared to monte carlo simulations .",
    "detection and rejection efficiencies for the veto will be discussed .",
    "parts of this work have been published during the respective phd periods  @xcite .",
    "here , a technical description of the apparatus is given .",
    "purpose and function of both parts of the veto , cherenkov and scintillator panels , is introduced .",
    "the trigger logic , calibration and data acquisition are summarized .       a sketch of the gerda experiment . ]    in gerda an array of bare germanium detectors is operated in a cryostat that contains 64  m@xmath19 of liquid argon ( lar ) as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] .",
    "the cryostat is surrounded by a water tank  with a diameter of 10  m and a height of 9.4  m that is filled with 590  t ultra - pure water ; its walls are covered with a reflective foil .",
    "the cryostat has a connection ( neck ) through the water tank  to the clean room above from which the germanium detectors are lowered into the lar .",
    "both water tank  and cryostat are part of the innovative shielding design of gerda  where low - z materials are used in order to reduce cosmogenic activation  @xcite .",
    "the gerda muon veto consists of two independent parts which are read out by the same daq .",
    "the first and main part is a water cherenkov veto that detects the cherenkov radiation of the traversing muons .",
    "thus , the water tank  is instrumented with 66 encapsulated photomultipliers ( pmts ) .",
    "the second part of the muon veto is comprised of plastic scintillator panels .",
    "since the cherenkov veto offers reduced tagging capability at or around the neck of the cryostat , plastic panels were placed on top of the clean room in order to close this weak spot in the cherenkov veto .      below the water level",
    "there are 66 pmts ( 8  size ) of type 9354kb/9350 kb by etl  @xcite installed . in order to protect the pmts from the surrounding water , each pmt",
    "is housed in a stainless - steel encapsulation which is further developed from the design of the  capsules  @xcite .",
    "the capsule of low radioactivity stainless - steel  @xcite is closed with a custom made pet cap and is filled with ir spectroscopy oil  @xcite .",
    "the oil keeps the optical transition between pet cap and pmt as smooth as possible .",
    "thus , efficiency losses by total internal reflections are minimized .",
    "the bottom of the base of the pmt is encased in polyurethane @xcite and sealed with silicon gel  @xcite .",
    "the lower part of the pmt , i.e. the dynode structure , is protected from magnetic fields by a cone of @xmath20-metal  @xcite .",

    "fig : distrib ] .",
    "one ring of six pmts ( 101 - 106 ) is pointing inside the separate volume under the cryostat ( commonly referred to as `` pillbox '' ) , two rings of eight pmts ( 201 - 208 ) and 12 pmts ( 301 - 312 ) respectively are placed on the bottom of the water tank  looking upwards and four rings of 10 pmts are placed on the wall ( 401 - 710 ) , pointing horizontally towards the cryostat .",
    "the number of pmts and their placement was chosen after an extensive monte carlo study  @xcite .",
    "the pmts closest to the cryostat , i.e those from the pillbox and the inner ring on the bottom , were selected according to their performance and radioactivity ( type 9354 kb is a low activity module ) .",
    "however , due to the distance to the germanium detectors and the low overall mass the radioactivity of the muon veto is negligible compared to the one of the stainless steel cryostat  @xcite .    the floor and the walls of the water tank  and of the cryostat are covered with the reflective daylighting film df2000ma ( commonly known as `` vm2000 '' )  @xcite which offers a reflectivity of @xmath1399% in order to increase the light yield of each event .",
    "this comes at the cost of a reduction in tracking capabilities of each individual muon .",
    "the reflective foil does not only increase the collected light yield of each muon , but it acts as a wave - length shifter as well .",
    "it shifts the predominantly ultra - violet cherenkov photons to around 400  nm where the pmts are most efficient .",

    "@xcite ]    the pmts are calibrated regularly with a set of five custom made diffuser balls shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffball ] which are constructed to provide a light source as isotropic as possible",
    ". these are glass balls with a diameter of 4.5  cm that are filled with a mixture of silicon gel  @xcite and glass pearls  @xcite with a diameter of @xmath850  @xmath20 m .",
    "an optical fibre is glued into a small vial inside the ball with a higher content of glass pearls .",
    "the cladding at the end of the fibre is removed and the fibre is roughened in order to obtain a diffuse light emission .",
    "ultra - fast leds outside of the water tank can be pulsed to illuminate the five diffuser balls @xcite .",
    "four of these balls are distributed in the main water tank  and a fifth is placed inside the `` pillbox '' . with an appropriate setting of the leds it is possible to illuminate all pmts simultaneously with single photons and thus record single - photon responses of every pmt at the same time .",
    "as the diffuser balls are working very well , the calibration fibres attached to every pmt are currently not in use .",
    "muons passing through the neck of the cryostat may either traverse a too short distance in the `` pillbox '' or in the water tank  to be detected . in order to keep the muon rejection efficiency as high as possible ,",
    "a veto of plastic scintillator panels was conceived and installed .",
    "each scintillator panel contains a @xmath23  cm@xmath19 sheet of plastic scintillator based on polystyrol with an addition of ptp ( 2% ) and popop ( 0.03% )  @xcite .",
    "in addition the panels contain optical fibres  @xcite on the narrow sides as light - guides , an electronics board with a trigger and shaper and a pmt .",
    "half of the panels are equipped with pmts by hamamatsu photonics  @xcite and the other half with pmt-085 by kvadrotech .",
    "the pmt-085 are powered by the same hv supply as the muon veto pmts however connecting 3 pmts to one hv output .",
    "the front - end electronics , the hamamatsu pmts and all other components are powered by a custom made power source with + 12  v and @xmath256  v.    the panels are arranged in three layers covering an area of @xmath26  m@xmath11 centered over the neck of the cryostat .",
    "it was aimed to keep both trigger rate and thus data volume of the veto as low as possible .",
    "therefore , the trigger is a triple coincidence of all three layers since this option offers a high discrimination against non - muonic background events in the panels such as @xmath27  rays from environmental radioactivity .",
    "thus , the scintillator veto records an almost pure muon sample .",
    "individually , each panel shows a pulse - height distribution which takes the form of a landau peak . despite the triple coincidence , small @xmath27  contamination at low pulse heights remains .",
    "these events can be discarded with a product cut of the form @xmath28 for the pulse heights @xmath29 of any pair of panels in the stack and constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "the inset shows the pulse height distribution of one panel and a landau - fit ( red ) ]      the entire apparatus is read out and operated by a vme data acquisition system ( daq ) which is almost identical to the one of the germanium daq ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "ten flash - adcs  @xcite with 8 channels each digitize the input signals of the cherenkov veto with 100  mhz .",
    "the signals in each channel are processed by a trapezoidal filter and if the height exceeds the threshold set to 0.5 photo - electrons ( p.e . )",
    "an internal trigger is generated .",
    "each fadc module has one trigger output which is the logic or of the internal triggers of its eight channels .",
    "thus , the pmt signals are connected to the input channels in such a way over the fadcs , that neighboring pmts are always read out by different fadcs .",
    "this allows the proper detection of clustered events in which pmts next to each other have fired .",
    "the final trigger condition is set such that five fadcs must trigger on at least 0.5 photo - electrons ( p.e . )",
    "each within 60  ns .",
    "that signal is realized by a fpga and it starts the readout of all traces covering a period of 4  @xmath20s .",

    "three additional fadcs of the same type digitize the signal of the scintillator veto .",
    "the signals of two non - neighboring panels within a layer are multiplexed onto one fadc channel using custom made reflection - free modules with an amplification of -6  db .",
    "thus the 36 panels occupy only 18 fadc channels such that each layer is read out by one fadc module .",
    "the panel stack which was hit can be determined by the unique combination of fired channels .",
    "the same trigger logic as for the cherenkov veto is applied for the panels , albeit the trigger window is larger in order to accommodate the much longer output signals of the panel pmts because they are shaped with a larger time constant .",
    "for a panel event , all three fadcs ( i.e. all three panels in a stack ) need to have fired . both types of trigger signals are accepted during data taking .    for a calibration run of the pmts , the standard data taking is stopped .",
    "the ultra - fast calibration leds are activated with a pulser and the led luminosity is controlled by a current source in form of a digital - to - analog converter  @xcite .",
    "a separate fadc reads out the pulser signal and triggers the entire veto for each pulse .",
    "two calibration spectra can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : calib ] .",
    "one is showing the conventionally recorded single - photon peak ( spp ) set to channel 100 , the other comes from a too bright led setting .",

    "i the muon daq was only stopped during breaks of the germanium data taking in order to perform short maintenance work and to calibrate the pmts by adjusting the hv of each pmt so that each module shows the same response to single photons .",

    "the offsets are for display only . for e.g.",

    "i two pmts were lost due to implosion of the tube ( pmts 401 & 604 ) . the implosion was mostly contained by the encapsulation and no other pmts in the vicinity were harmed .",
    "the implosions happened in february and april 2012 and the pmts were over 10  m apart .",
    "hence a direct influence can be ruled out .",
    "a third pmt was lost right after installation due to a punctured cable ( pmt 305 ) and a fourth pmt ceased working during the installation and could be immediately exchanged ( pmt 203 ) . in july 2013 ,",
    "the gerda  water tank  was drained , the veto inspected and two of these pmts were successfully exchanged ( pmts 305 & 401 ) . all other pmts still work as intended and showed little to no signs of deterioration .",
    "the performance of the muon veto was simulated with the geant4-based  @xcite framework for gerda and majorana ( mage )  @xcite .",
    "first , the simulations were used to find initial placements and efficiencies  @xcite and repeated once the exact geometries of the apparatus were finalized  @xcite .",
    "the muon spectra provided by the macro experiment were used as input for the simulation of cosmogenic muons  @xcite .",
    "the simulations were mainly used to determine the efficiency of the apparatus in case the muon caused any energy deposition in the germanium crystals .    for the efficiency of the cherenkov veto",
    "the simulation was undertaken in two parts .",
    "firstly , muons were simulated with the cherenkov effect switched off .",
    "the primary vertices of those muons that caused energy deposition in the germanium detectors were extracted from these events .",
    "secondly , these selected muons were used in a second simulation with cherenkov effect enabled .",
    "this two - step procedure was applied in order to accelerate the simulation as only a minute fraction of the muons interact with the germanium detectors and because the simulation of optical photons is a resource - demanding procedure .",
    "a detection efficiency for the veto was derived by determining the fraction of energy depositing muons which caused a trigger signal in the muon veto .",
    "the trigger condition were the same as for the muon veto daq described in sec .",
    "[ sec : daq ] .",
    "for the entire veto a detection efficiency of @xmath32 for muons with energy deposition in the germanium detectors was found in the simulated data .    by removing certain pmts from the efficiency calculations ,",
    "a veto degradation ( e.g. possibly broken pmts or malfunctioning fadcs ) was simulated .",
    "even with the first two fadcs removed ( 14 pmts in total , two in each of the seven rings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib ] ) , the efficiency is still ( 99.525@xmath33)% . however when only four pmts in the pillbox are removed the value drops to ( 97.855@xmath34)% .",
    "the pillbox pmts can hence be considered the most critical ones in case of a break - down .",
    "the light produced inside the pillbox can illuminate the main water tank  through two small manholes .",
    "however , the light coming from these two holes is not sufficient in order to generate a trigger .",
    "the insensitivity against a loss of a few pmts gives high reliability of the efficiency of the veto against small variations of trigger conditions or changes in the amplitude of the pmts .    in an earlier work",
    "the efficiency was estimated as @xmath35% and thus some what lower despite lower trigger conditions  @xcite .",
    "the previous simulation neglected the optical connection between the `` pillbox '' volume and the main water tank  completely .",
    "several other simulation studies have been performed like the veto response to regular cosmogenic muons which are shown and compared to experimental data in the next sections .",
    "photo - electron spectra for all cosmogenic muons ( top ) and those with energy deposition in the germanium detectors ( bottom ) . in each panel",
    "the total recorded p.e . spectrum ( red ) is compared to the spectrum which is recorded just in the pillbox ( green ) .",
    "spectra derived from simulations ( blue ) are normalized to the same exposure ]    the light yield of a single muon is determined by observing the total number of recorded p.e . in all pmts . for comparison ,",
    "the pillbox is treated as an individual volume . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lenght ] histograms of the recorded and simulated events are shown for the period of phase  i. in the spectra for the cosmogenic muons , apart from the very low light yield there are maxima at about 167  p.e . in the pillbox data and about 605  p.e .",
    "for the total spectrum .",
    "these broad peaks correspond to the mean traversed distance of 1.8  m for the pillbox and of 9  m for the water tank  for muons with a mean incident angle of @xmath36 .",
    "light from muons in the water tank  is subject to attenuation , the attenuation length of photons in water being @xmath810  m. assuming a mean distance of 5  m of the pmts from the muon track in the water tank  and 2  m in the pillbox , muons of any track deposit approximately the same amount of light .",
    "thus , each muon generates @xmath37 p.e./m .",
    "this is reproduced by the simulation .",
    "a peak structure is visible in the data for muons which deposit energy in the germanium detectors as well .",
    "the peak for the pillbox is at slightly lower p.e .",
    "values because the average incident zenith angle is lower and thus the track length shorter .",
    "spectrum for all pmts shows a double peak feature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the muon has to cross the cryostat in order to deposit energy in the germanium .",
    "the muon can deposit light in the water tank  before and after interacting with the germanium detectors .",
    "the higher peak corresponds to muons which pass the tank twice and the smaller corresponds to muons that pass the water tank  just once ( e.g. shallow angles close to the neck of the cryostat ) .",
    "again , the simulations agree with this even though the double peak structure is less pronounced .",
    "another characteristic of a muon event is the number of fired pmts .",
    "this multiplicity @xmath38 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mult ] for several classes of muon events .",
    "the spectrum of all measured events ( green line ) shows a peak at @xmath38@xmath1360 and another one at @xmath38@xmath1510 .",
    "the peak at high @xmath38 is the regular response of the veto to muons .",
    "this is verified by either the simulated data ( blue line ) and a subset of all events in which the panel veto has to have fired as well ( red line ) .",
    "the shape of the spectra is slightly different which is due to different incident angles ( panel trigger ) or the lack of random coincidences at low multiplicities in the simulated data .",
    "in addition , four pmts were lost in the cherenkov veto which enhances the peak at @xmath38@xmath1360 .",
    "this is due to events that would trigger all pmts are now recorded as having an @xmath38=(@xmath39 ) , where @xmath40 is the amount of lost pmts .",

    "the multiplicity of all events ( green ) is compared with events where the panels have fired as well ( red ) and with simulated data ( blue ) .",
    "histograms after cuts are marked by dashed lines ]    only the measured spectrum from the cherenkov trigger shows the low multiplicity enhancement , which is characterized by not only a low number of fired pmts but also an unusually low amount of recorded p.e . with a cut of 18  p.e",

    "are negligible compared to the true coincident rate .      a muon rejection efficiency ( mre ) can be obtained by defining a cut for clearly identified muon hits in the germanium detectors and testing for coincident veto signals .",

    "the following cuts were applied to the germanium events of the gerda  phase  i data to identify muons : either a single hit showed an energy depostion of more than 8.5  mev or the summed energy of a multi - hit exceeded 4 mev . this cut excluded energy depositions from the u and th decay chains .",

    "were these 14 events not vetoed , they would have led to a contribution to the bi of : @xmath52 a simulated value for the muonic background in the germanium array surviving anti - coincidence cuts is  @xcite @xmath53 as this simulation was undertaken before construction of the experiment was finalized the geometry differs to what was realized . due to the different geometry ,",
    "the low statistics and the subsequent large errors , both results can be considered sufficiently in agreement .    with bi@xmath54 and the previously derived mre ,",
    "an estimation of the unvetoed background contribution can be given .",
    "it is assumed that the mre is constant over the entire energy range of the germanium detectors .",
    "the given vetoed bi is equivalent to the amount of successfully vetoed muons , i.e. 99.2% .",
    "an amount of unvetoed muons is found : @xmath55 the design goal of phase ii of gerda  aims to reach a total bi of @xmath56  cts/(kev@xmath5kg@xmath5yr ) .",
    "thus , with the current settings of the muon veto unchanged , unvetoed muons would contribute 1/40 of the bi `` allowance '' .",
    "for phase  i of gerda  this is equivalent to 0.16 events in a 200  kev analysis window .      in order to determine the efficiency of the panels , a data sample of clearly identified muons",
    "was selected .",
    "a cut on the cherenkov events of @xmath5720 was chosen which discards unphysical events at low @xmath38 .",
    "the pre - selection of muon events by the cherenkov veto is necessary because the standard trigger of the plastic veto can not be used . for the panels a simple cut on the pulse heights is insufficient due to the @xmath27  coincidences at low pulse heights ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : panscat ] ) .",
    "in addition to the pulse height cut defined by the trigger threshold , a cut on the product of two pulse heights in the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] was applied .",
    "the detection efficiency of one panel can now be given as the ratio of events , in which the top and bottom panel of a stack have fired in comparison to the events where all three panels in a stack have fired .",
    "the data set contained events since the beginning of the muon data taking with the panels in august 2011 . in this",
    "set , 30  044 events were found which triggered the top and bottom panel . of these events",
    "29  951 triggered the third panel as well .",
    "this leads to an average muon detection efficiency per panel of : @xmath58 since this value is an average over different panels , it can be seen as an approximation for a general panel efficiency .",
    "the efficiency of a triple stack of panels is hence @xmath59% . due to insensitive areas at the panel borders ( scintillator edges , encasing ) the effective area of the panels",
    "is reduced by @xmath85  mm per border or less than @xmath60% of the area .",
    "the enhancement at low multiplicities is characterized by a very low number of recorded photo - electrons ( in most cases one or two p.e . per pmt ) without any observable clustering effects and amounts to about 8.7% of the overall cherenkov activity ( i.e. @xmath61/s ) .",
    "this behavior suggests a very faint source of light inside the water tank  that is not directly caused by muons .",
    "events which trigger the panel veto and can hence be considered true muon events do not show this anomaly .",
    "it was already suggested that this anomaly is caused by scintillation of the reflective foil under irradiation by @xmath62 sources in the stainless steel of the water tank  @xcite .",
    "the foil has a highly reflective front side and is covered with an adhesive on the back side . according to the manufacturer the foil itself has a thickness of 66  @xmath20 m  and the adhesive a thickness of 38  @xmath20 m  @xcite . if the adhesive can be assumed to be an organic compound a mean free path of @xmath830  @xmath20 m  for a 5  mev @xmath62 particle is expected .",
    "hence it is unlikely that @xmath62 particles coming from the back side are able to deposit energy in the foil and produce scintillation photons which can exit the foil on the front side .",
    "this was tested by illuminating the foil with an @xmath63am @xmath62 source and by recording the scintillation light on the front side with a 9235q pmt . when the foil was illuminated from the back side , i.e. through the adhesive , almost no additional light was recorded .",
    "when the adhesive was removed from the back side the same measurement yielded a small effect . if illuminated on the front side sufficient photons",
    "were recorded which could explain the enhancement if applied to the conditions in the water tank . however",
    ", this suggests that the @xmath62 source is either solved in the ultra - pure water or adhering to the front side of the foil .",
    "the activity of water from this plant was measured to have an overall @xmath62 activity in the range of 10@xmath6410@xmath65  bq / kg  @xcite and measurements of gerda  water samples agree with these values  @xcite .",
    "this activity is too low to explain these excess events .",
    "if the front side of the foil had a radon contamination , a higher rate would have been expected after the opening of the water tank .",
    "a higher rate was indeed measured but this was in accordance to a higher dark rate after prolonged exposure to light of the cherenkov pmts .",
    "another explanation for the origin of this anomaly are @xmath66 sources since electrons have much higher specific ranges in comparison to @xmath62 particles .",
    "the stainless steel of the gerda  water tank  exhibits a low level of radioactivity and one of the strongest contribution to the radionuclides in the steel is the @xmath66 emitter @xmath67co with an activity of @xmath820  mbq / kg  @xcite which leads to a @xmath67co activity on the surface of the water tank  of @xmath85  bq . to test the effect",
    "the foil was illuminated by a @xmath67co - source ( @xmath68  mev ) and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmfrontback ] .     the effect of irradiation of the vm2000 reflective foil by a @xmath66 source ( @xmath67co ) recorded by a pmt .",
    "the single photon response ( red ) is compared to an irradiation from the front ( blue ) or back side ( green ) which carries the adhesive ]    the foil was illuminated from the front and from the back side ( adhesive not removed ) .",
    "the back illumination shows only a slightly smaller scintillation effect in comparison to the front illumination and in both spectra a low - energy @xmath66 spectrum emerges . in order to determine an efficiency for this process",
    ", the scintillation rate of a 5  mm thick sheet of plastic scintillator was recorded that is assumed to have an efficiency of unity . by comparing the rate of the foil with the rate of the scintillator",
    ", the efficiency of the foil towards @xmath69  mev @xmath66 particles can be calculated : @xmath70 with this efficiency , the activity expected from @xmath67co from the steel is reduced to @xmath80.6/s which is still too high in comparison to the measured rate . using the mean light recorded by the illumination measurements ,",
    "the solid angle ( 8.5% of 4@xmath71 ) and efficiency ( 0.25 ) of the pmt used for this test , the efficiency ( 0.3 ) and surface coverage ( 0.005 ) of the pmts in the gerda  water tank  the effect of this scintillation can be calculated .",
    "it is found that the bulk of these events would deposit 2 - 6 p.e . in the pmts per event .",
    "these events will on average not fulfill the trigger conditions given in sec .",
    "[ sec : daq ] it is still likely that about 1% of these events could still trigger the veto .",
    "this would put the expected and measured rate as well as the expected photon yield of one to two p.e .",
    "per pmt into the same order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the scintillation caused by @xmath66 particles has to be considered the most likely source of this enhancement .",
    "in this work , the muon veto deployed during phase  i of the gerda experiment was introduced , its hardware was presented and its performance was shown .",
    "in addition , the cosmogenic components of the background in gerda was systematically identified , analyzed and compared to monte carlo simulations .",
    "the hardware thresholds were chosen in a way , that by design a very pure muon sample is recorded with only a few percent contamination by random coincidences or other sources of background . with this powerful muon veto over two years of data",
    "have been recorded including the 491  days coincident with the germanium detectors .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of earlier works were extended to accommodate for a more realistic set - up of the muon veto .",
    "pmt multiplicity and p.e .",
    "spectra were found in good agreement with the data and the light deposition of cosmogenic and energy - depositing muons could be related to their different track - lengths in the water tank . with the updated geometry",
    "a detection efficiency of @xmath72% was found for the simulated energy - depositing muons in the water tank .",
    "the muon events in the germanium detectors were studied in detail .",
    "a cut on the signals of the germanium detectors was defined that identifies muon hits . from comparison to coincident muon events a rejection efficiency of @xmath73% was found .",
    "the events would have produced a background index of @xmath74 .",
