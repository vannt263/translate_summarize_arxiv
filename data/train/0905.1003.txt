    "this is why we stick to the setup of @xcite , which as well is more popular for interacting diffusions . for the transition kernel @xmath4",

    "+ the interesting feature of the symbiotic branching model is that it connects examples  [ ex1]-[ex3 ] above .",
    "being first established as a time - space inhomogeneous version of a pair of super random walks , the examples from above appear as special cases : @xmath17 obviously corresponds to the mutually catalytic branching model .",
    "the case @xmath40 with the additional assumption @xmath43 corresponds to the stepping stone model as can be seen as follows : since in the perfectly negatively correlated case @xmath44 , the sum @xmath45 solves a discrete heat equation and with the further assumption @xmath43 stays constant for all time .",

    "+ let us first fix some notation",
    ". in the following @xmath74 denotes a continuous time markov process with transition rates @xmath4 and @xmath75 $ ] . due to the moment - duality for symbiotic branching processes ( see lemma [ lem : moment - duality ] ) the notation of symmetrization is needed . for two independent markov processes",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 with transition rates @xmath4 the symmetrization is defined as @xmath78 the transition rates of the symmetrization are given by @xmath79 its transition probabilities are denoted @xmath80 . note that in the symmetric case @xmath81 . the green function of @xmath74 is denoted @xmath82 and we abbreviate @xmath83 .",
    "further , we set @xmath84 and abbreviate @xmath85 .",

    ". then @xmath88 is intermittent if and only if @xmath89 in particular , there is no intermittency for non - positive @xmath18 .",
    "the previous theorem suggests @xmath64 deviding symbiotic branching into two regimes in which the @xmath90 regime behaves like the parabolic anderson model with respect to intermittency .",
    "+ although after understanding the two - types particle moment - dual ( lemma [ mom ] ) one sees that the problem can be treated as for @xmath41 , we present a new proof . in @xcite results of @xcite for higher moments of the parabolic anderson model were generalized to more general symmetric transitions than the discrete laplacian . here ,",
    "in particular , complete results for the asymptotic behaviour ( exponential and subexponential ) of second moments of the parabolic anderson model with arbitrary transitions @xmath4 are proven . + in the course of the proofs we obtain the expression @xmath91 for the second lyapunov exponent , where @xmath92 is the inverse of the laplace transform of the return probabilities ( see proposition [ prop1 ] ) .",
    "this expression , by tauberian theorems , gives us the explicit asymptotic behaviour for the lyapunov exponents as function of @xmath11 . in the following",

    "[ cor]let @xmath88 be a solution of the symbiotic branching model with homogeneous initial conditions .",

    "an example which was not included is for instance the riemann walk defined in example [ e1 ] . since in this case @xmath115 it serves as a convenient example for the above results which exhibits a precise recurrence / transience transition at @xmath116 .",
    "further , the simple random walk on @xmath5 is contained with @xmath117    combining the intermittency result with the extension of the results of @xcite given in @xcite , we support the unstable behaviour of symbiotic branching for @xmath90 .",
    "it is quite standard ( see for instance @xcite ) that spatial processes being intermittent have a very local property : for large times the mass of the process is concentrated on few sites ( `` islands '' ) . since for symbiotic branching , on each finite box solutions approach each constant configuration infinitely often , the islands do not stabilize . since the diffusion function has the form @xmath118 , we see that @xmath47 will not produce high peaks if @xmath49 is very small and vice versa .",
    "hence , we suspect that @xmath119 are concentrated on the same islands .",

    "further , for the super random walk ( in our model related to @xmath17 ) it was shown that aging appears exactly in dimensions @xmath122 .",

    "<S> our approach also provides an alternative , elementary proof and refinements of classical results concerning second moments of the parabolic anderson model with brownian potential . some refinements to more general ( also infinite range ) kernels of recent aging results of @xcite for interacting diffusions are given .    , </S>"
