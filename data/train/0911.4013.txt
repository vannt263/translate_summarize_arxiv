    "a new stage in hypernuclear physics has been opened by the @xmath18-ray spectroscopy for @xmath11 hypernuclei , where level structures of the order of kev are revealed systematically . in order to extract valuable information on hypernuclear structure and underlying @xmath7 interactions from these extremely precise data ; it is therefore indispensable to utilize accurate models for the many - body wave functions .",
    "our special concern in this work is the structure of a multiplet of @xmath11 hypernuclei specified by an isospin @xmath19 , which have provided us with many interesting subjects so far .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath0 multiplet with mass number @xmath20 , @xmath1he , @xmath1li and @xmath1be , their core nuclei are neutron or proton halo nuclei .",
    "when a @xmath11 particle is added to the core nuclei , @xmath21he , @xmath21li(@xmath0 ) and @xmath21be , the resultant hypernuclear systems become more stable against neutron or proton emission . hereafter , @xmath0 excited states of @xmath21li and @xmath1li are denoted as @xmath21li@xmath22 and @xmath1li@xmath22 .",
    "this stabilization is caused by the so - called `` gluelike '' role of the @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the role of @xmath11 particle , we can expect an interesting possibility that neutron ( proton ) drip lines in @xmath11 hypernuclei are extended far away from those in ordinary nuclear systems .    in the past ,",
    "the level structures in @xmath1he , @xmath1li ( @xmath23 and @xmath1be were studied with the three - body @xmath24he@xmath25 model @xcite , where only the even - state @xmath7 interaction was used . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pointed out that there appear halo or skin structures in the ground state or some excited states of these hypernuclei .",
    "recently , the experimental energy of the @xmath0 @xmath26 state of @xmath1li has been observed through the high - resolution @xmath18-ray experiment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is proposed to produce @xmath1he by @xmath27 at jlab .",
    "one aim in the present work is to discuss halo or skin structure in the extended framework of an @xmath2 four - body model .",
    "another interesting subject to discuss the spin - doublet state , @xmath13-@xmath12 in @xmath1he and @xmath1li ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is considered that these excited @xmath13-@xmath12 doublets are related intimately to the spin - dependent potentials of the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "therefore , it is important to discuss these splitting energies to determine the spin - dependent parts of the @xmath7 interaction .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the spin - doublet structures of @xmath28li in @xmath29 states and the underlying spin - dependent interactions were investigated successfully in the @xmath30 four - body cluster model . here , the @xmath31 and @xmath32 interactions were chosen so as to reproduce the corresponding phase shifts , and the @xmath33 interaction was done so as to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath34he ) , and the @xmath7 spin - spin ( spin - orbit ) interaction was fitted so as to be consistent with the @xmath8-@xmath9 ( @xmath13-@xmath12 ) , spin - doublet energy separation in @xmath35h ( @xmath36be ) . in the present work , our four - body analyses for @xmath28li ( @xmath29 )",
    "is extended straightforwardly to the @xmath0 multiplet ( @xmath28he , @xmath28li@xmath22 , @xmath28be ) , where an asterisk stands for the @xmath0 excited states .",
    "an important subject related to the isospin multiplet of @xmath11 hypernuclei is the charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) components in @xmath7 interactions .",
    "the most reliable evidence for the csb interaction appears in the @xmath11 binding energies @xmath37 of the @xmath38 members with @xmath39 ( @xmath35he and @xmath35h ) .",
    "then , the csb effects are attributed to the differences @xmath40he@xmath41h ) , the experimental values of which are @xmath42 mev and @xmath43 mev for the ground ( @xmath8 ) and excited ( @xmath9 ) states , respectively . there",
    "exist mirror hypernuclei in the @xmath44-shell region such as the @xmath0 multiplet with @xmath20 ( @xmath28he , @xmath28li@xmath22 , @xmath28be ) , @xmath39 multiplet with @xmath45 ( @xmath46li , @xmath46be ) , @xmath39 multiplet with @xmath47 ( @xmath48be , @xmath48b ) , and so on .",
    "historically , some authors mentioned csb effects in these @xmath44-shell @xmath11 hypernuclei @xcite . however , there is no microscopic calculation of these hypernuclei taking account of the csb interaction .",
    "it is well known that the experimental values @xmath49 can be fitted phenomenologically by an effective spin - independent csb interaction . on the other hand , in the case of a meson - theoretical model an ope - type csb potential",
    "is derived through a @xmath50 mixing effect , where the triplet csb interaction is much stronger than the singlet one due to the tensor - force contribution .",
    "this feature is in strong disagreement with that in the phenomenological force which is almost spin - independent .",
    "this difference between triplet and singlet csb interactions appears in the elaborate four - body calculations for @xmath35he and @xmath35h with use of the nijmegen soft core model ( nsc97e model ) @xcite , in which the csb components are generated by the mass difference within the @xmath51-multiplet mixed in @xmath11 states and the @xmath50 mixing effect .",
    "because the origin of the csb interaction is not yet settled , we treat it phenomenologically in the present study : similarly to ref.@xcite , the csb interaction is determined so as to reproduce the values of @xmath49 obtained from the @xmath11 binding energies of @xmath35h and @xmath35he .",
    "then , the @xmath0 triplet hypernuclei with @xmath20 ( @xmath28he , @xmath28li@xmath22 , @xmath28be ) are studied with use of this csb interaction in the four - body cluster model .",
    "additionally , the csb effects in the @xmath39 doublet hypernuclei with @xmath45 are investigated within the @xmath52 and @xmath53 cluster models for @xmath46be and @xmath46li , respectively . in this work ,",
    "we study @xmath20 hypernuclei within the framework of an @xmath2 four - body model so as to take account of the full correlations among all the constituent baryons .",
    "two - body interactions among constituent particles are chosen so as to reproduce all the existing binding energies of the sub - systems ( @xmath54 , and so on ) .",
    "this feature is important in the analysis of the energy levels of these hypernuclei .",
    "our analysis is performed systematically for ground and excited states of @xmath55 systems with no more adjustable parameters in this stage , so that these predictions offer important guidance for the interpretation of the upcoming hypernucleus experiments such as the @xmath56li@xmath27 @xmath1he reaction at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .    in sec .",

    "this structure can be nicely imaged as three layers of matter distribution composed of an @xmath14 core , a @xmath11 skin and a neutron ( proton ) halo . here , the proton - density distribution in the @xmath13 state of @xmath1li@xmath22 has a particularly longer tail than those in the others due to the very weak binding of the halo proton from the lowest @xmath136he@xmath137 threshold .",
    "it is considered that the @xmath12-@xmath13 spin - doublet states in @xmath1he and @xmath1li@xmath22 give valuable information about the underlying spin - dependence of the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "let us investigate these states straightforwardly with use of the @xmath7 interaction determined in the analysis for the @xmath29 spin - doublet states in @xmath1li .",
    "the results for @xmath28he and @xmath28li@xmath22 are displayed in fig.2 and fig.3 , respectively . because their features are not different from each other , here we pick up the former case .",
    "then , let us remark how the energies of the @xmath12-@xmath13 spin - doublet states are changed by adding the components of @xmath7 interaction successively .",
    "we see that the resultant energy splitting of @xmath13-@xmath12 states in @xmath28he is given as about 0.1 mev , being the combined contributions from the spin - spin , sls and als interactions as explained below .",
    "we can see the same tendency in @xmath1li@xmath22 in fig.3 .",
    "it should be noted here that the splitting energies of the @xmath0 @xmath12-@xmath13 states are much smaller than those of the @xmath29 @xmath135-@xmath12 and @xmath13-@xmath138 doublet states in @xmath1li given in ref.@xcite . to understand the reason for the difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath29 doublet splittings ,",
    "first we remark that the spin - isospin structure of @xmath139 system on the @xmath14 core is @xmath140_s$ ] ( cf.eq.(2.3 ) ) . in the case of @xmath0 states ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath141 pair is in spin - singlet states ( @xmath142 , spin antiparallel ) , while in @xmath1li @xmath143 ) the @xmath144 pair outside the @xmath14 core is in a spin - triplet state ( @xmath145 , spin - parallel ) .",
    "in general the numbers of @xmath7 triplet and singlet bonds are different between the @xmath146 and @xmath147 partner states .",
    "thus difference in spin - value of @xmath148 leads to the different contributions of the @xmath7 spin - spin interactions to the doublet splittings .",
    "let us see in more detail how the @xmath7 spin - spin interactions contribute to the @xmath12-@xmath13 splitting in @xmath28he(@xmath0 ) .",
    "both doublet states are composed of the @xmath149 @xmath150 pair in the spin - singlet state coupled to the @xmath151-state @xmath11 . as mentioned above , the situation is notably different from that of the @xmath13-@xmath138 doublet in @xmath1li @xmath143 ) which is based on the @xmath152 @xmath153_{j=3^+}$ ] core state and therefore the @xmath154 @xmath138 partner is characterized by the spin - stretched configuration .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath29 case , both of the @xmath155 @xmath12 state and the @xmath154 @xmath13 state in @xmath1he @xmath156 ) include @xmath7 spin - singlet and spin - triplet states . however , we find that the contribution of the @xmath7 spin - singlet state is negligbly small in the @xmath154 @xmath13 state . as a result",
    "the even - state spin - spin part of the @xmath7 interaction gives rise to the splitting energy of about 0.31 mev ( see `` even '' column . ) .",
    "in addition , when the odd - state interaction is switched on , the energy splitting is reduced to be about 0.13 ( see `` + odd '' column . ) mev .",
    "the major reason for this reduction is because @xmath157 is more repulsive than @xmath158 , and therefore the @xmath12 state including @xmath7 spin - singlet component is pushed up more than the @xmath13 state .",
    "moreover , we continue to add sls and als contributions to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 doublet states . as shown in fig.2 , the sls works attractively for the @xmath13 state , because the contribution of the @xmath7 spin - triplet state is dominated in this state . on the other hand ,",
    "the als works significantly in the @xmath12 state , because the als acts between spin=0 and 1 @xmath7 states .",
    "however , the als does not efficiently work in the @xmath13 state , because the spin - singlet component is small in this state . as a result ,",
    "the energy splitting of @xmath13-@xmath12 states including both spin - spin and spin - orbit terms in @xmath28he leads to 0.08 mev .",
    "we can see the same tendency in @xmath1li@xmath22 and the resultant splitting is 0.09 mev as shown in fig.3 . if the experimental energy resolution becomes good enough to discuss the present splitting energy , we would have a chance of getting information about the spin - dependent parts of the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "there still remain certain effects of the @xmath7 tensor interaction on the doublet splittings . in this paper for the @xmath0 isotriplet states @xmath159 ) , however , we apply the prescription adopted in the analysis of the @xmath29 @xmath1li states @xcite and therefore we do not include the tensor component .",
    "here we note that the @xmath78 tensor contribution is small compared to the spin - spin interaction , however another tensor effect comes from the @xmath160 coupling .",
    "in fact , accounting for @xmath161 coupling by modifying the @xmath7 interaction alters its effect on doublet splitting , and hence introduces an uncertainty in the calculation . according to the @xmath51-mixing studied within the shell model @xcite , the energy shifts amount to several tens of kev in some of the @xmath162 states of @xmath1li .",
    "the cluster model estimates for such effect will be discussed in the next stage .",
    "let s focus on the ground states in @xmath1he and @xmath1be and the @xmath0 @xmath135 state in @xmath1li , which are the members of the iso - triplet .",
    "the csb effect has to be reflected also in their binding energies in the same way as in the @xmath39 iso - doublet members @xmath10h and @xmath10he .    as explained in sec.[sec : csb ] , we introduce the phenomenological csb potential with the central - force component only . the cs part of the two - body @xmath7 interaction is fixed to reproduce the averaged energy spectra of @xmath10h and @xmath10he , and then the csb part is adjusted so as to reproduce simultaneously the energy levels of these hypernuclei .",
    "the spin - spin part of the csb can be determined by performing this adjusting procedures both for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states .",
    "first , in fig . 6 , we show the energy spectra of @xmath20 hypernuclei without the csb interaction .",
    "the ground - state energy of @xmath1he is @xmath163 mev with the respect to the @xmath164 four - body breakup threshold . with increase of the proton numbers ,",
    "the coulomb repulsion becomes more and more effective as going from @xmath1li@xmath22 to @xmath1be .",
    "recently in kek - e419 experiment @xcite , they produced the @xmath0 @xmath135 state of @xmath28li .",
    "the observed value of @xmath107=5.26 mev is in good agreement with our calculated value 5.28 mev . in the case of @xmath1be , there are the old emulsion data giving @xmath107=5.16 mev .",
    "this value should be compared with our obtained value 5.21 mev .",
    "then , the @xmath107 value in the ground @xmath135 state of @xmath1he is predicted to be 5.36 mev without taking the csb effect into account .",
    "next , let s consider the csb effects in @xmath20 iso - triplet hypernuclei . in fig .",
    "7 , we show the energy spectra of those hypernuclei calculated with the csb interaction switched on . in the @xmath1li case",
    ", the csb interaction brings about almost no contribution to the @xmath11 binding energies , because there is one proton and one neutron outside the @xmath14 core and the @xmath165 and @xmath166 csb interactions cancel with each other . on the other hand , the csb interaction works repulsively ( + 0.20 mev ) and attractively ( @xmath167 mev ) in the @xmath1he and @xmath1be cases , respectively .",
    "therefore , our result indicates that if the experimental energy resolution is as good enough as less than 0.2 mev , the csb effect could be observed in these cases .",
    "it should be noted here that only the even - state part of our csb interaction is taken into account in consistent with the observed binding energies of @xmath10h and @xmath10he .    in the @xmath1be case ,",
    "the @xmath11 energy becomes more bound by 0.2 mev due to the attractive cbs interaction between the @xmath11 and two protons , that is @xmath168 mev .",
    "the experimental @xmath37 value is found to be reproduced without the csb effect and the inclusion of the csb contribution goes unfavorably . in order to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath1be",
    ", the csb interaction seems to be vanishing or even of opposite sign from that in the @xmath38 system .",
    "there still remains a problem in our treatment for the @xmath1be system : the calculated value 0.79 mev of the lowest resonance energy of the @xmath21be is not in agreement with the experimental value 1.37 mev .",
    "when the attractive @xmath169 interaction is switched off , the @xmath21be@xmath170 resonance energy becomes 1.18 mev , which is still a bit lower than the observed value .",
    "this change of the calculated resonance energy from 0.79 to 1.18 mev makes the @xmath37 value smaller by only 30 kev .",
    "thus , the change of the @xmath37 value is considered to be so small , even if the @xmath169 interaction is adjusted so as to just reproduce the value 1.37 mev .    in the @xmath1he case ,",
    "the csb interaction between the @xmath11 and two valence neutrons works repulsively and the ground - state binding energy becomes @xmath171 mev , less bound by 0.2 mev , than the value without the csb effect .",
    "though there is no data for @xmath1he at present , the @xmath107 of @xmath1he will be obtained soon by the @xmath27 reaction experiment done at jlab .",
    "it is interesting to know whether or not the csb effect in @xmath1he is consistent with the emulsion data for @xmath172be ) .",
    "let us study another sets of two mirror hypernuclei , @xmath108li and @xmath108be , in the @xmath44-shell region within the framework of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 cluster models .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath37 from the emulsion data are @xmath173 mev and @xmath174 mev for @xmath46li and @xmath46be , respectively .",
    "thus , the energy difference @xmath175be ) @xmath176li ) is 0.04 mev , which is much smaller than the experimental value @xmath177he ) @xmath178h)=0.35 mev .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that due to the strong coulomb force in @xmath45 hypernuclei , @xmath179 seems small and hence charge symmetry breaking effect seems small .",
    "it is interesting to see how much @xmath179 is obtained in an actual microscopic calculation by introducing the phenomenological csb interaction .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the cluster model calculations were performed for these hypernuclei with use of the charge symmetric @xmath14-@xmath180 , @xmath11-@xmath14 and @xmath11-@xmath180 interactions adjusted so as to reproduce the experimental value 6.80 mev for @xmath46li .",
    "then , the obtained value of @xmath37 was 6.72 mev for @xmath46be , where the difference from the value for @xmath46li was only due to the difference of the coulomb - force contributions .    in order to see the effect of the csb interaction",
    ", we repeated the energy level calculations employing the present interactions given in the section [ interaction ] .",
    "when only the cs parts of @xmath7 interactions are used , the calculated values of @xmath181li ) and @xmath181be ) are 6.80 and 6.84 mev , respectively . here",
    "these cs parts are slightly modified from that in ref.@xcite so as to reproduce well the experimental value of @xmath182li ) finally .",
    "switching on the csb parts , the calculated values of @xmath37 become 6.74 and 6.90 mev for @xmath46li and @xmath46be , respectively , then , the calculated value of @xmath175be ) @xmath176li ) is 0.16 mev .",
    "thus , the use of the csb interaction determined in the @xmath38 systems leads to a larger value of @xmath179 in comparison with the experimental value of 0.04 mev . in order to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath179 , here ,",
    "let us have a try to introduce an odd - state csb interaction phenomenologically , whose contributions in the @xmath38 systems are negligible : we found that the experimental values of @xmath37 for @xmath46li and @xmath46be can be reproduced by adding a rather long - ranged odd - state interaction with the opposite sign of the even state csb interaction described in eq.(3.5 ) .",
    "the @xmath107 values of @xmath108li and @xmath108be calculated with both even - state and odd - state csb interactions are 6.81 mev and 6.83 mev , respectively , which are in good agreement with the data .",
    "the present framework for the @xmath45 iso - multiplet systems has a sort of limitation in the sense that the @xmath180 cluster is assumed to have 3 nucleons of the same size of those in @xmath14 .",
    "however , the results for both systems of @xmath20 and 8 are qualitatively consistent with each other , and the odd state of the csb interaction are found to have an opposite sign of the even state csb interaction determined at @xmath38 hypernuclei .    in the near future",
    ", we expect to have the observed @xmath107 of @xmath1he from the @xmath27 reaction experiment done at jlab .",
    "on the basis of the coming data , it might be possible to get information on the odd - state cbs interactions .",
    "another example to clarify the even- and odd - state csb interactions is to study @xmath183be with an @xmath184 four - body model .",
    "this four - body calculation is in progress . also , we hope to observe the @xmath107 of this hypernucleus by @xmath185b@xmath186be at jlab in the future .",
    "we have studied the structures of the @xmath0 triplet hypernuclei ( @xmath1he , @xmath1li and @xmath1be ) within the framework of @xmath187 four - body model . in the previous paper",
    "this four - body model proved to work successfully in the detailed analysis of the @xmath29 energy levels of @xmath28li which are best known through the high - resolution @xmath18-ray measurements .",
    "the present framework is also a natural extension of the previous calculations performed with the @xmath24he@xmath25 three - body model in which the @xmath11 particle motion was confined to form the @xmath24he ground state .",
    "the major conclusions are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) on the basis of reasonable @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath4 and @xmath190 interactions , which well describe the binding energies of all sub - cluster units ( @xmath189 , @xmath4 and @xmath190 ) , we have made extensive and successful structure analyses for the @xmath0 states of @xmath20 iso - triplet hypernuclei .",
    "one of the non - trivial and important outcomes is that the observed @xmath37 value of the @xmath0 @xmath135 state in @xmath28li is reproduced nicely with the use of the @xmath4 and @xmath7 interactions determined in @xmath29 states of @xmath28li .",
    "also the @xmath191be ) observed in emulsion is reproduced well , though there still remains a problem that the unbound @xmath21be @xmath8 state is calculated at a bit lower position in comparison with the observed resonance energy .",
    "the @xmath11 binding energy for @xmath28he @xmath192 , which has not been observed so far , is calculated to be around 5.16@xmath1935.36 mev ( with or without the csb interaction ) .",
    "this result will be tested when the result of the @xmath56li@xmath194he experiment comes from jlab .",
    "\\(2 ) as one of the purposes of the extended calculations , we have carefully tested whether the @xmath12 and @xmath13 spin - doublet excited states ( @xmath195 @xmath11 coupled to the @xmath196 excited core ) are bound or not , since they were calculated previously to be just above the nucleon breakup threshold ( weakly unbound ) as a result of the limited three - body model of @xmath24he+n+n .",
    "it is interesting to see the gluelike role of the @xmath11 particle carefully when it is added to the core nuclei having a nucleon halo structure as concerned here . in this paper",
    "the four - body calculation , which allows free motion of @xmath11 , gives a clear prediction that the excited spin - doublet states in @xmath1he ( @xmath1li ) become bound , respectively , at 1.3 mev ( 0.3 mev ) below than the lowest nucleon - breakup threshold @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "the energy splitting between these @xmath0 doublet states comes from the spin - spin and spin - orbit interactions , which is calculated to be around 0.1 mev .",
    "if any coincidence experiment is available and the energy resolution is good enough to resolve the 0.1 mev splitting , one would have a chance of extracting information on the spin - dependent interactions . in @xmath1be , however , we do not expect to get the corresponding bound excited states .",
    "\\(3 ) it is interesting to get the three - layer structure of the matter distributions in the @xmath0 iso - triplet hypernuclear states , which consist of the @xmath11 particle coupled to the nuclear core having neutron or proton halo .",
    "the typical numbers of the r.m.s .",
    "radii for the @xmath1he(j=@xmath13 ) , @xmath1li@xmath22(j=@xmath13 ) and @xmath1be(j=@xmath135 ) states are calculated to be @xmath199 fm for innermost @xmath14 , @xmath200 fm for the @xmath11 distribution , and @xmath201 fm for the outermost valence nucleon distribution .",
    "\\(4 ) the charge symmetry breaking effects in light @xmath44-shell hypernuclei have been investigated quantitatively for the first time on the basis of the phenomenological csb interaction which describe the experimental energy difference between @xmath202h ) and @xmath202he ) .",
    "here we found that the inclusion of this csb interaction gives rise to push up the @xmath28he energy by 0.20 mev , but it pushes down the @xmath28be energy by 0.20 mev . in @xmath28li@xmath22 ,",
    "the level energies remain unchanged by adding the csb interaction because of cancellation between contribution of valence proton and neutron on @xmath14 . comparing the calculated value of @xmath203be ) with the emulsion data",
    ", it seems that the csb interaction makes the agreement worse . in the case of @xmath28be , however , there remains a problem of treating the unbound @xmath21be core within our framework .",
    "the csb effect is expected to appear more clearly in the coming data of @xmath28he , whose core nucleus @xmath21he is a bound system .",
    "next , we have tried to explain the binding energy difference of @xmath39 iso - doublet @xmath45 hypernuclei ( @xmath46li , @xmath46be ) , adopting the phenomenological three - body models of @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively .",
    "the energy difference between @xmath46li and @xmath46be , obtained in emulsion , can not be reproduced accurately with use of our csb interaction .",
    "thus , our analyses for @xmath44-shell hypernuclei demonstrate that the csb interaction determined in the @xmath35h and @xmath35he doublet is not necessarily consistent with the experimental @xmath37 values of @xmath28be , @xmath46li and @xmath46be in emulsion .",
    "\\(5 ) as a trial , we have introduced the odd - state component of the csb interaction , which is of a longer range than the even - state one . in order to reproduce the experimental data of @xmath46li and @xmath46be , it is found to be necessary that the sign of the odd - state part is opposite with respect to that of the even part .",
    "it is likely that such an odd - state csb interaction plays some role in the above @xmath20 four - body systems .",
    "it is known that the csb are generated essentially by the mass difference within the @xmath51-multiplet mixed , and the @xmath206 mixing in the meson - theoretical model .",
    "thus , in order to get a firm conclusion on this matter , it is necessary to perform four - body calculation of @xmath38 @xmath11 hypernuclei and @xmath20 @xmath11 hypernuclei taking @xmath81 and @xmath207 and @xmath55 and @xmath208 , respectively .",
