    "in multi - subject studies where observations are considered to be functional realizations , it is common to observe large amounts of between - subject heterogeneity in the sense that some subjects produce curves that are quite smooth while others produce curves that are ( much ) more erratic . although not often explicitly considered when modeling these types of data , the variability in curve shape can be an important feature that may help distinguish individuals and lead to better understanding of processes under study and/or better predictions .",
    "often in these studies two types of predictions are desired : those that predict the functional output across the entire time domain for a hypothetical new subject and those that complete a partially observed functional response for subjects currently participating in the study . explicitly considering curve shape in modeling , in addition to considering relevant covariates ,",
    "should improve both types of predictions .",
    "this is particularly true of the application motivating the present study .",
    "decision makers of teams that belong to the national basketball association ( nba ) are very interested in being able to group and predict future performance of basketball players that are employed or could possibly be employed by nba teams .",
    "the nba is a north american professional mens basketball league that arguably employs the worlds most gifted basketball players .",
    "the league s popularity has steadily increased and as a result player salaries have exploded .",
    "personnel decisions in the nba ( as in most professional sports leagues ) are high - risk transactions . in the face of massive amounts",
    "uncertainty teams offer players guaranteed multi - year multi - million dollar contracts and as a result mistakes in player acquisition are extremely expensive . making things",
    "even more treacherous are the abstruse rules governing player transactions found in the collective bargaining agreement ( cba ) . among other things ,",
    "the cba regulates the amount of resources dedicated to player acquisition .",
    "teams that misallocate player salary resources by over paying severely hinder a team s future flexibility and negatively impact a team s future competitiveness and profitability for years .",
    "because of this , added value might be assigned to players who perform consistently compared to those that are more up and down .",
    "figure [ rawscatterplot ] displays scatter - plots and loess curves ( with a span of 0.3 ) of game - by - game `` production '' for three nba basketball players .",
    "game - by - game `` production '' in figure [ rawscatterplot ] is measured using the so called game score statistic ( @xcite ) .",
    "more details are provided in section [ examples ] and the appendix , but for now it suffices to know that higher values correspond with better performance and more production .",
    "even though there is a large amount of game - to - game and player - to - player variability in game score it is still evident that production consistency between the three players varies .",
    "erick dampier appears to have two spikes of improved production , jarron collin s production oscillates during the first part of his career while ray allen s production is fairly smooth as it gradually increases and decreases with slight dip in the middle .",
    "therefore curve shape should contain information that is valuable in distinguishing between different types of players and being able to assess their future value .",
    "two types of predictions are used to assess future value .",
    "the first considers players who are currently members of the nba and that will continue to participate in future games .",
    "ray allen in figure [ rawscatterplot ] is an example of such a player .",
    "although he has already played in more than 1000 games , he continues to play and predicting the performance for the remainder of his career is of considerable interest .",
    "this type of prediction will be referred to as `` active player prediction '' .",
    "the second type of prediction considers basketball players who have yet to play in an nba game but who have a skill set that will attract interest from nba teams . for these players , predicting the entire career production curve is of interest .",
    "this type of prediction will be referred to as `` career prediction '' .",
    "it has become fairly common to consider the longitudinal curves of the type just described as discretized realizations of functional data .",
    "there is now a large literature dedicated to functional data analysis ( fda ) techniques .",
    "a few popular methods that are actively being researched are functional principal components ( @xcite , @xcite ) , gaussian process regression methods ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) and multi - level functional basis expansion ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . when considering multiple - subject studies the methods just described tend to separate individuals according to trend levels only , while ignoring the shape of the longitudinal projections .",
    "though the idea of explicitly using shape or smoothness of curves to improve prediction is intuitively appealing there is surprisingly very little in the statistical literature dedicated to it .",
    "the one article that we are aware of is @xcite whose focus is on estimating rate functions through a complicated system of differential equations and using covariates to explain variability in trajectories via stochastic volatility models .",
    "they applied their method to a longitudinal multi - subject blood pressure study for pregnant women and noted that blood pressure trajectories for normal women were more smooth relative to women with preeclampsia .",
    "we however , take an entirely different approach .",
    "instead of dealing with a complicated system of differential equations we incorporate curve shape in modeling through a penalty parameter analogous to that found in penalized splines .",
    "our model involves an implied distribution on partitions of players .",
    "the allocation variables are treated as parameters and thus our approach may be seen as an extension of latent class analysis ( lca ) ( @xcite ) which classifies individual player curves into @xmath0 pre - specificed clusters ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . unlike lca , our methodology does not require a fixed pre - specified number of clusters as this is inferred from the corresponding posterior distribution on partitions .",
    "we briefly note that there does exist a small literature dedicated to estimating certain aspects of functional output such as dynamics ( the speed of price increases and the rate at which this speed changes ) that depend on covariate information ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "but these are not relevant to the current setting as they fail to deal with multiple - subject studies nor do they use curve shape in prediction and inference .    in sports , @xcite model career trajectories ( or aging curves )",
    "non parametrically in order to make historical comparisons of player s abilities in baseball , hockey and golf .",
    "@xcite consider career paths of golf players to determine combinations of luck and skill required to win a golf tournament .",
    "neither of these works were interested in grouping players to carry out career and active player predictions .",
    "as noted , our principal goal is making active player and career predictions .",
    "if predictions are computed using methods that treat individual players independently , then both types of predictions would be extremely poor as they would not be data driven .",
    "one way of improving predictions is by borrowing strength ( or sharing information ) among players whose career production curves might be deemed similar . a straightforward way of borrowing strength is by introducing player clusters .",
    "however , if all individuals of the same cluster are restricted to have the same curve , then some individuals will invariably be poorly fit ( too much borrowing of strength ) . alternatively ,",
    "if curves of all individuals of the same cluster are completely unrestricted , then clustering players would provide no predictive information ( too little borrowing of strength ) .",
    "the methodology proposed in this article is able to balance very well the desire to produce good fitting individual curves while still producing clusters that allow enough borrowing of strength among similar players to guide prediction .",
    "this is carried out by employing a hierarchical model where subject - specific functions are modeled flexibly through a linear combination of basis functions whose coefficients are drawn from cluster - specific process level distributions . doing this produces flexible subject - specific curves while still being able to produce reasonably accurate predictions by pooling together players with similar features / performances .    in our model ,",
    "having covariate dependent clusters is crucial to carrying out career prediction as these are produced using the predictive distribution available from the covariate dependent clustering mechanism .",
    "also , shape dependent clusters are useful to carrying out active player predictions as incomplete active player curves are filled in using curves of retired players that have similar career trajectories .",
    "there has been work regarding completing curves ( @xcite work out best linear unbiased predictors ( blups ) for past and future curve segments ) and local borrowing of strength to fit global curves ( @xcite employ functional dirichlet processes to group gaussian process realizations ) , but the approaches developed and purposes are very much different from the present study .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the data collected and employed in the analysis .",
    "section 3 provides details regarding the development of the methodology highlighting model components associated with cluster - specific curve smoothness and active player prediction .",
    "section 4 provides details regarding computation of posterior and predictive distributions . in section 5",
    "we provide details of a small simulation study .",
    "results from the analysis of the nba application are provided in section 6 .",
    "finally , we provide some concluding remarks in section 7 .",
    "we collected common game - by - game ( including playoffs ) modern basketball metrics for each player drafted into the nba during the years 1992 - 2004 ( shaquille oneal to dwight howard ) that participated in at least one game up through the 2009/2010 season .",
    "this resulted in 576 players with number of games played ranging from 2 to 1383 games .",
    "a few of the players appeared in very few games and are not representative of a typical nba player .",
    "because of this , and to reduce the noise introduced by the careers of players that contain little information regarding the processes of interest , we restrict our attention to players with at least three seasons of experience ( the rookie contract length of the 2005 cba ) . also , to retain enough games to get a reasonable sense of a player s ability we only include players who played at least a half a season s worth of games ( 42 ) . finally , we excluded the following 8 players whose careers were cut short either by career ending injuries or untimely deaths : bryant reeves , malik sealy , eddy curry , jason collier , eddie griffin , yao ming , t. j. ford , and gilbert arenas .",
    "this resulted in 408 players with number of games played through the 2009/2010 season ranging from 45 to 1383 .",
    "of the 408 players , 263 are classified as `` retired '' as they did not play beyond the 2009/2010 season .",
    "measuring game - by - game production is not straightforward as there are numerous , difficult to measure factors that influence player performance . because of this no gold standard basketball production metric exists .",
    "that said , one that has become somewhat popular is john hollinger s so called game score which is a linear combination of common variables that are recorded for each player through out the course of a game ( e.g. , number of baskets made and number of steals acquired .",
    "more details can be found in the appendix and at @xcite ) .",
    "this metric will be used as our response variable and therefore a representation of a player s game productivity . though game score has deficiencies ( e.g. , weighted heavily towards offensive output and does nt account for quality of opponent )",
    ", it provides a fairly accurate indicator of player production for any given game .",
    "the maximum game score collected is 63.5 ( corresponding to kobe bryant s 81 point game ) .",
    "the minimum game score was -9.9 and the average game score among all players is 8.1 .",
    "an alternative to raw game score is a standardized game score where standardization is carried out by dividing game score by the minutes played in each game , thus removing games score s dependence on minutes played .",
    "however , players whose production is not negatively impacted by increased minutes are more valuable than those who are less efficient with increased game time and distinguishing between these types of players is desirable .",
    "for this reason we opt to use raw game score values .    for an aging ( or time ) variable there are various units that could be used . for example , age , number of accumulated minutes played , or simply the number of games played are all reasonable .",
    "since each of these measurements are only available to us on a game - by - game basis , the shape ( or smoothness ) of the curve remains unchanged regardless of age unit employed .",
    "thus for sake of expositional clarity we use number of games played ( see figure [ rawscatterplot ] as an example ) .    through exploratory analysis we identified three covariates that in addition to being of interest in their own right are informative in grouping players .",
    "these are age during first game played ( measured in years ) , experience before being drafted into the nba ( high school basketball only , some collegiate basketball , or international basketball ) , and draft order .",
    "draft order is the order in which players are selected in their respective drafts .",
    "for example , a player with draft order @xmath1 implies he was the first player selected in his respective draft , and draft order @xmath2 implies he was the second player selected etc . in section 3",
    "we describe how draft order is used explicitly to predict total games played for active players , but as a covariate used to influence clustering we categorize a player s draft order as being a top five pick , a first round pick ( excluding the first five ) and a second round pick .",
    "( since 1989 the nba draft has consisted of two rounds . )",
    "table [ playercategorysummary ] provides the number of players in each of the nine categories .",
    "other baseline covariates were considered such as position , height , and other physiological characteristics but preliminary research indicated they were not useful in partitioning players with regards to production .",
    ".total number of players in each of the nine categories .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]          a nice property of the model is the ability to postulate what characteristics guide clustering .",
    "to do this it is necessary to obtain a point estimate using cluster mcmc iterates . since posterior summaries of cluster specific parameters are arbitrary , using typical posterior summaries ( mean and median ) makes little sense .",
    "we employ @xcite s method which is based on least - squares distance from the matrix of posterior pairwise co - clustering probabilities . using this method produces a partitioning of the 408 players into 18 clusters with cluster membership ranging from 3 to 63 players .",
    "figure [ allclustercurves ] provides player - specific posterior mean curves for nine clusters . except for cluster 6 ,",
    "these clusters represent those that contain the highest number of players ( approximately 80% of players ) .",
    "cluster 6 was selected as it contains curves that are in our opinion more interesting than clusters not shown .",
    "the remaining nine clusters for the most part are comprised of role players .",
    "although each cluster contains curves that are slightly unique , they are relatively flat .",
    "the dashed segments at the end of some curves are active player predictions . to facilitate comparisons",
    "we maintain the @xmath3-axis on the percentile number of games played scale .",
    "we highlight a few of the clusters by pointing out some of the well known players .",
    "cluster 1 is comprised of role players ( e.g. , tony allen and matt bonner ) whose production is constant .",
    "cluster 2 s key member is lebron james .",
    "players in this cluster begin careers close to peak level and appear to maintain production .",
    "cluster 3 contains carlos boozer and ron artest who had sharp increase in production but maintained peak performance for a short time with a gradual decrease in performance .",
    "cluster 4 is comprised of role players who showed an increase in production right before retiring ( e.g. james posey ) .",
    "kobe bryant is the key player of cluster 5 ( along with chauncey billups , steve nash ) . in this cluster , players started slow but experienced large sharp increases of production and maintained it for much of their career .",
    "clusters 6 and 7 are comprised of players who start at peak performance and gradually decline through out their career with players in cluster 6 showing a brief increase towards the end of their career .",
    "grant hill is a member of cluster 6 and shaquille oneal is a member of cluster 7 .",
    "clusters 8 and 9 are primarily comprised of role players with cluster 8 showing gradual increase until the later stages of a career .",
    "an example is matt barnes .",
    "marcus camby is member of cluster 9 and the decrease in production towards the end of the career is more sharp relative to cluster 8 .",
    "overall , the clusters contain curves that have distinct shapes .",
    "information provided in figure [ allclustercurves ] could potentially be used to guide nba personnel decisions regarding contract length and amount .",
    "for example , production for players in 3 begins to decrease earlier than cluster 2 .",
    "finally , figure [ clusint ] displays the average age during first game played vs. the percent of players in each of the six categories for each of the 18 clusters .",
    "apart from demonstrating the presence of an interaction between the three covariates , these plots confirm what is already widely known .",
    "that is , on average , the age of players increases as draft order increases and players that play college tend to begin nba careers at an older age relative to high school and international players .          as mentioned previously ,",
    "incorporating the ppmx in the hierarchical model improves predictions at the cost of a small loss in individual fits . to show that the cost is minimal relative to gains in prediction , we randomly selected 50 retired players and removed the final 25% of games played ( essentially treating them as active players ) .",
    "we then proceeded to fit four models ( details follow ) to these partitioned data and assess model fit through mean square error ( mse ) . to assess prediction accuracy ,",
    "active player prediction was carried out for each of the 50 randomly selected players and mean squared prediction error ( mspe ) was computed .",
    "the four models considered were the sp model ( [ dgm ] ) , an extension of the sp model that improves prediction , the hppmx , and the following 5th degree polynomial regression model : @xmath4    the sp model ( [ dgm ] ) was extended in the following way @xmath5 we refer to this model as hsp ( hierarchical semi - parametric ) . predicting ( or extrapolating )",
    "the last 25% of games played using the sp model requires drawing @xmath6 s associated with knots for removed games from its prior distribution . therefore ,",
    "centering the prior on a vector of global spline coefficients should improve prediction relative to a prior centered at 0 .",
    "the mse averaged over the 408 players was calculated for each of the four models resulting in polynomial ( 30.72 ) , sp ( 29.66 ) , hsp ( 29.71 ) , hppmx ( 31.71 ) . as expected the flexible penalized splines produce the smallest mse and hppmx has the highest mse illustrating the surrender of a bit of individual player fit .",
    "the mspe averaged over the 50 randomly selected players turned out to be polynomial ( 476.32 ) , sp ( 34.00 ) , hsp ( 31.10 ) , and hppmx ( 26.90 ) .",
    "as expected hppmx gained quite a bit in terms of prediction ( extrapolation ) accuracy at a fairly minimal individual fit cost .",
    "we have proposed a completely novel methodology that incorporates information regarding the shape of longitudinal curves in predicting future nba player production based on age , experience , and draft order of player .",
    "clearly , curve shape provides information beyond available covariates and the inclusion of this information in modeling efforts should improve inferences .",
    "in addition , the methodology does well in balancing individual fits and producing clusters that provide adequate borrowing of strength among players .",
    "the ppmx prior employed does a nice job of being able to incorporate both covariate and curve shape information when forming clusters and ultimately borrowing strength among subjects to improve active player and career predictions . from a basketball perspective",
    ", individual player production clearly depends on many omitted variables ( such as team strength , injury history and coaching philosophy ) and these variables can be easily incorporated in the model using the ppmx prior when they become available .",
    "finally , though the methodology was demonstrated using production curves of nba basketball players , the idea of incorporating curve shape in inferences should be applicable in a wide variety of settings ( e.g. , biomedical , finance , and environmental studies ) .",
    "the authors wish to thank the reviewers and editors for their comments , which improved the paper .",

    "<S> we consider a study of players employed by teams who are members of the national basketball association where units of observation are functional curves that are realizations of production measurements taken through the course of one s career . </S>",
    "<S> the observed functional output displays large amounts of between player heterogeneity in the sense that some individuals produce curves that are fairly smooth while others are ( much ) more erratic . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this variability in curve shape is a feature that can be exploited to guide decision making , learn about processes under study and improve prediction . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we develop a methodology that takes advantage of this feature when clustering functional curves . </S>",
    "<S> individual curves are flexibly modeled using bayesian penalized b - splines while a hierarchical structure allows the clustering to be guided by the smoothness of individual curves . in a sense , the hierarchical structure balances the desire to fit individual curves well while still producing meaningful clusters that are used to guide prediction . </S>",
    "<S> we seamlessly incorporate available covariate information to guide the clustering of curves non - parametrically through the use of a product partition model prior for a random partition of individuals . </S>",
    "<S> clustering based on curve smoothness and subject - specific covariate information is particularly important in carrying out the two types of predictions that are of interest , those that complete a partially observed curve from an active player , and those that predict the entire career curve for a player yet to play in the national basketball association . </S>"
