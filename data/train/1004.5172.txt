    "the study of topological insulators@xcite has taken off in the last few years , proving to be an exciting area of research in condensed matter physics , while also having ties to fundamental physics due to the possibility of providing a testbed for exotic particles like majorana fermions , @xcite fractionally charged vortices,@xcite axions @xcite and magnetic monopoles.@xcite    in general , topological insulators are bulk insulators having an energy gap between the valence and conduction bands , but with gapless edge states ( 2d ) or surface states ( 3d ) , caused by spin - orbit coupling , which are immune to non - magnetic impurities and geometric perturbations .",
    "similar in spirit to the quantum hall effect , the novelty of a topological insulator ( ti ) lies in the fact that it can be characterized by a topological invariant , and is not the result of a spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "however , the invariant can not take on any integer value , as in the in the quantum hall case , but is instead a so called @xmath0 topological quantum number that we label @xmath1 , which can be either 0 or 1 . in 2d",
    "a single @xmath0 invariant is sufficient for the job , whereas in 3d one needs 4 @xmath0 invariants @xmath2 , which distinguish 16 possible topological phases and fall into the two general classes : weak ( wti ) and strong ( sti ) topological insulators.@xcite in 3d if there are an odd number of surface states then we have @xmath3 and the system is in the sti phase . if there is an even number of surface states ( possibly zero ) then @xmath4 and we have a trivial insulator or wti if any of the @xmath5 are nonzero .",
    "the 2d topological insulator , also known as the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phase , was independently proposed by two groups,@xcite and to date a variety of models have been established that can support the ti phase . the original model on the honeycomb lattice",
    "was realized by superposing two copies of the haldane model,@xcite one for spin up and other for spin down electrons , with the spin up and down electrons moving in opposite directions along the edge.@xcite it was then predicted theoretically,@xcite and later confirmed experimentally,@xcite that this effect is present in the hgte / cdte quantum wells .",
    "fu and kane extended the concept to 3d with a toy model on the diamond lattice,@xcite and also predicted that the alloy bi@xmath6sb@xmath7 , which has large spin orbit coupling , would be a three dimensional ti.@xcite this was later verified experimentally by arpes measurements which directly observed the topological surface states.@xcite other models with a low energy dirac structure , namely the 2d kagome and 3d pyrochlore systems , have been recently shown to support topological states .",
    "@xcite experimentally the most promising system is currently bi@xmath8se@xmath9 , which is known to have a large bandgap and a single surface dirac cone .",
    "although not experimentally verified , there is also some theoretical work on topological insulators in cold atoms , which looks promising.@xcite    on a practical level , these gapless surface states are robust against disorder , since time reversal symmetry disallows back scattering from non magnetic impurities .",
    "when gapped by time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbations , superconducting or excitonic pairing , these surface states give rise to interesting insulating phases with exotic quasiparticle excitations already mentioned above .",
    "electric manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom in topological insulators should also be possible and they can therefore be of value in spintronics applications .",
    "some of the existing topological insulators are also known to be among the best thermoelectric materials , such as the material bi@xmath8te@xmath9 discussed by zhang et .",
    "@xcite and thus discovery of new materials or further understanding of existing ones would be of value .    in this paper",
    ", we present another possible host for a topological insulator , namely the lieb lattice in 2d and its 3d counterpart the perovskite or edge centered cubic lattice .",
    "we show that a simple tight - binding model for electrons on these lattices leads to ti behavior in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "these toy models are novel in that unlike most of the existing models , they have a simple cubic symmetry , and exhibit only a single dirac node in the spectrum intersecting a degenerate flat band precisely at the dirac point .",
    "we also briefly discuss other perturbations that lead to topologically trivial gapped phases .",
    "we begin with the tight - binding hamiltonian    @xmath10    where @xmath11 creates an electron of spin @xmath12 on site @xmath13 of the so called lieb lattice , seen in fig .",
    "[ unit_cell]a , and @xmath14 is the hopping amplitude for nearest neighbour sites .     and @xmath15 .",
    "( b ) tight - binding dispersion for @xmath16 .",
    "( c ) bandstructure for strip of @xmath17 unit cells with open boundary conditions along the @xmath18 direction and infinite along @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "( d ) as in ( c ) , but with @xmath21 instead . ]    in momentum space eq.([h0 ] ) becomes @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 where the lower triangle of the matrix is understood to be filled so that the matrix is hermitian .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath16 consists of one degenerate flat band @xmath25 and two dispersive bands @xmath26 where the brillouin zone spans @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "plotting these bands yields a low energy dirac like dispersion ( seen in fig .",
    "[ unit_cell]b ) , with a single dirac cone in the brillouin zone . at one third",
    "filling then , band 1 will be completely filled , with the degenerate flat band and the upper band being empty , and this state will behave as a gapless band insulator .",
    "there are several perturbations to the basic hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) that open up a gap while respecting the translational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "the simplest option is to add an on site energy @xmath29 to all the sites that have only two nearest neighbours in fig .",
    "[ unit_cell]a above , or conversely the inequivalent sites with four nearest neighbours .",
    "we note that this set up has been discussed recently in the context of ultracold fermionic atoms .",
    "@xcite here , one of the dispersing bands remains touching the flat band while the other dispersing band becomes isolated .",
    "another option is to add a dimerization term , which staggers the hopping amplitude along both the @xmath30 and @xmath31 directions so that @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the flat band becomes isolated from the dispersing bands , which are gapped symmetrically ( shown for strip geometry in fig .",
    "[ unit_cell]c ) .",
    "lastly , including a rashba spin orbit term will again isolate the flat band , while also splitting the spin degeneracy among the valence and conduction bands . in all of the above cases",
    "the resulting insulating phases are characterized by conventional broken symmetries and are topologically trivial .",
    "the recent paper by green , santos and chamon@xcite discusses a similar set of energy bands having a flat band directly through the middle of a single dirac cone , which have been created via staggered flux phases on the kagome lattice .",
    "although their interests lie with the flat band itself , they discuss possible insulating phases that can be introduced in order to isolate the flat band and determine that , for spinless fermions , time reversal symmetry must be broken in order to achieve this .",
    "seeing as the lieb lattice requires no magnetic field to create the same energy band structure , perhaps it is of some interest then that we can isolate the flat band without breaking time reversal symmetry by way of the dimerization term mentioned above .",
    "now , to see if this model can support a ti phase we include the intrinsic so interaction term @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the amplitude for the next - nearest neighbour spin - orbit - induced interaction ( shown in fig .",
    "[ unit_cell]a ) , the term @xmath35=@xmath36=@xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the two unit vectors along the nearest neighbour bonds connecting site @xmath13 to its next - nearest neighbour @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the vector of pauli spin matrices .",
    "this will also lead to the formation of a gap at the dirac point while preserving @xmath42 and the translational symmetry of @xmath43 .",
    "fourier transforming , we have @xmath44 where the @xmath45 sign refers to spin up ( down ) electrons , and the spectrum for the full hamiltonian , @xmath46 , then consists of the same degenerate flat band @xmath25 , and the modified doubly degenerate dispersive bands @xmath47 with a gap @xmath48 at the dirac point .",
    "we note that the flat band eliminates the possibility of writing down a low energy dirac expansion for the system in terms of the pauli matrices , as discussed e.g.  in ref .   and other topological insulator models , but , following ref .",
    "[ ] , it is possible to express the full hamiltonian above in terms of a set of @xmath49 matrices that form a spin-1 representation of @xmath50 .",
    "although not a focus here , this makes it possible , for instance , to calculate the chern numbers of the bands analytically .    to prove that our system is indeed a topological insulator ,",
    "we now show by an explicit calculation that it possesses a nontrivial z@xmath51 invariant .",
    "there are several ways to do this in practice , although they are found to be equivalent in the end , so we use the method that is most convenient .    according to fu and kane@xcite when a crystal possesses inversion symmetry the z@xmath51 topological invariant @xmath1 is related to the parity eigenvalues @xmath52 of the 2@xmath53-th occupied energy band at the four @xmath42-invariant momenta @xmath54 .",
    "our system is inversion symmetric and so we can use this method to find @xmath1 .",
    "if we select site 1 of the unit cell as the center of inversion then the parity operator acts as @xmath55= [ \\psi_1(-{{\\bf r}}),\\psi_2(-{{\\bf r}}-{{\\bf a}}_1),\\psi_3(-{{\\bf r}}-{{\\bf a}}_2)]$ ] on the triad of the electron wavefunctions in the unit cell labeled by vector @xmath56 . in momentum space",
    "the parity operator becomes a diagonal @xmath57 matrix @xmath58 and the four @xmath42-invariant momenta can be expressed as @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath61 can be found analytically in this case and it is then easy to determine the parity eigenvalues of the occupied bands . at @xmath62 filling we find that three @xmath63 s are positive and one is negative . which of the four @xmath63 s is negative depends on the choice of the inversion center but the product @xmath64 is independent of this choice and determines the non - trivial z@xmath51 invariant @xmath65 , confirming that the system is indeed a topological insulator .",
    "similar considerations for @xmath66 filling also yield @xmath65 .",
    "next , we solve the model in a strip geometry numerically using exact diagonalization , in order to incorporate edge effects and demonstrate the bulk - boundary correspondence , which states that whenever @xmath65 there will be a pair of topologically protected gapless modes along each edge in the system . for the trivial insulating state with @xmath67",
    ", we find no edge states ( fig .",
    "[ unit_cell]c ) , but for @xmath68 , we indeed find a pair of spin - filtered gapless states associated with each edge , as seen in fig .",
    "[ unit_cell]d .",
    "as there are 3 atoms in the unit cell , the two edges of the slab are not equivalent , and therefore the edge states are not degenerate .",
    "the perovskite lattice , depicted in fig .",
    "[ perovskite]a , is a straightforward generalization of the lieb lattice into 3d and can be viewed as a simple cubic lattice with additional sites positioned at the centers of all edges .    .",
    "( d ) as in ( c ) , but with @xmath20 . ]    as with the lieb lattice , our starting point is the tight binding model given in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) , which in momentum space gives @xmath69 the spectrum then consists of two degenerate flat bands @xmath70 and the two dispersive bands @xmath71 again , we have a single dirac point in the brillouin zone and at @xmath72 filling the system behaves as a gapless band insulator . the spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ perovskite]c . as above",
    ", we can create a topologically trivial insulating phases by including an anisotropic on site term or a dimerization ( fig .",
    "[ perovskite]d ) .    to open up a topologically non - trivial gap , we consider spin - orbit coupling eq .",
    "( [ hso ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath73 now lie in three - dimensional space , the hamiltonian does not decouple for the two spin projections as above , and instead becomes an @xmath74 matrix in @xmath75-space .",
    "the spectrum can be found numerically and is shown in fig .",
    "[ perovskiteii]a . unlike the model on the lieb lattice",
    ", the addition of the spin orbit term creates a dispersion in the degenerate flat bands and a gap that depends on the sign of @xmath34 , which is no longer symmetric around zero energy . switching the sign of @xmath34 inverts the band structure .",
    "we now study the topological classes of these insulating phases .",
    "as above , the @xmath0 topological invariants @xmath76 are easy to evaluate when a crystal possesses inversion symmetry and can be determined from knowledge of the parity eigenvalues @xmath52 of the 2@xmath53-th occupied energy band at the 8 @xmath42-invariant momenta ( trim ) @xmath77 that satisfy @xmath78 .",
    "the 8 trim in our system can be expressed in terms of primitive reciprocal lattice vectors as @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 is determined by the product @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "if we select site 1 of the unit cell , fig.[perovskite ] , as the center of inversion then the parity operator acts as @xmath85= [ \\psi_1(-{\\bf r}),\\psi_2(-{\\bf r}-{\\bf a}_1),\\psi_3(-{\\bf r}-{\\bf a}_2),\\psi_4(-{\\bf r}-{\\bf a}_3)]$ ] on the four - component electron wave function in the unit cell labeled by vector @xmath86 . in momentum space and",
    "including spin the parity operator becomes a diagonal @xmath74 matrix @xmath87 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the eigenstates of @xmath88 and the parity eigenvalues of the occupied bands numerically , then determine the @xmath0 invariants . at quarter filling , we find that @xmath89 at the @xmath90 point and @xmath91 at the other trim , so the spin - orbit phase is a @xmath92 strong topological insulator .    incorporating edge effects into the system with a slab geometry and plotting the band energies along lines connecting the four surface trim ( fig .",
    "[ perovskiteii]b ) , we can also see the bulk energy bands and an odd number of surface states which traverse the gap , a behavior characteristic of sti .    .",
    "( b ) bandstructure for slab geometry along lines connecting four surface trim for @xmath21 . ]",
    "we have established a model for a topological insulator on lattices with simple cubic symmetry . in 2d",
    "we have shown that a tight - binding model with spin - orbit coupling on the lieb lattice supports gapless topologically protected edge modes , and possesses a non - trivial @xmath93 invariant . in 3d",
    ", we have demonstrated that a similar model on the perovskite lattice supports 2d gapless surface states when in the ( 1;111 ) sti phase , brought on by spin orbit coupling .",
    "we have also identified other gapped phases in these models that are topologically trivial .",
    "in addition to the topologically non - trivial band structures , the models considered here exhibit flat bands , which could give rise to interesting strongly correlated electron states even for relatively weak interaction strength.@xcite a necessary condition for non - trivial correlated physics is that the single - electron states forming the flat band are delocalized in space ( localized states typically lead to formation of a wigner crystal ) .",
    "delocalized single - electron states are guaranteed to exist if the flat band possesses a non - zero topological invariant , as happens e.g.  in quantum hall liquids .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case in models considered in this study . in the lieb lattice spin - orbit coupling preserves the flat band and separates from other bands .",
    "the resulting flat band however turns out to be topologically trivial , i.e. it has @xmath94 , while the ti behavior derives from the two dispersive bands which have @xmath65 . in the perovskite lattice spin - orbit coupling",
    "produces a significant dispersion in the original flat band and this will limit the importance of correlations in the system .    can our model be realized in a physical system ?",
    "there exist many perovskites in nature as well as many layered perovskites composed of weakly coupled 2d planes with lieb lattice structure .",
    "the most prominent example of the latter are the cuo@xmath51 planes in high-@xmath95 cuprate superconductors such as yba@xmath51cu@xmath96o@xmath97 or bi@xmath51sr@xmath51cacu@xmath51o@xmath98 . in 3d ,",
    "our model system is an idealization of the naturally occurring perovskites , most of which also have a heavy central atom in the middle of each cubic cell , such as srtio@xmath9 or the double perovskite structure ba@xmath8naoso@xmath99 . in these real materials the electron behavior near",
    "the fermi level derives from the @xmath100 and @xmath101 orbitals of the transition metal element occupying the cubic site while the edge sites are normally oxygens whose @xmath102-orbitals are far away from the fermi level .",
    "the resulting band structure for the active orbitals is then significantly more complex than that captured in our simple tight binding model .",
    "nevertheless , our model calculations demonstrate that this class of tight - binding hamiltonians on lattices with cubic symmetry can support topological phases , both in 2d and 3d .",
    "we hope that our work will stimulate detailed band structure calculations of perovskites with heavy transition metal elements in search for new families of topological insulators .    in the more exotic realm",
    ", it might be possible to artificially engineer the 2d system by modulating a two - dimensional electron gas with a periodic potential having lieb symmetry , as achieved recently in constructing the ` artificial graphene'.@xcite another possibility lies with cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices as discussed in refs ."
