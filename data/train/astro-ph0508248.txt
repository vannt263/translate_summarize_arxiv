    "the radiative cooling time of gas in the central regions of galaxy clusters ( cool cores ) is generally much smaller than the hubble time . in the absence of any heating sources",
    ", this means that the intracluster medium ( icm ) flows subsonically toward the cluster center with a mass deposition rate of @xmath0@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this flow was called a `` cooling flow '' .",
    "however , recent x - ray observations have shown that the cooling rate of the icm is much smaller .",
    "the japanese _ asca _ team indicated that metal emission lines from the low temperature cooling gas were much weaker than that had been predicted by the classical cooling flow model @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by _ xmm - newton _ @xcite ; the actual mass deposition rates are about 1/10 of those predicted by the classical cooling flow model .",
    "the lack of metal emission lines indicates that the gas is prevented from cooling by some heating sources . at present ,",
    "the most popular candidate for the heating source is the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) at the cluster center @xcite .",
    "however , it is not understood how the energy ejected by the agn is transfered into the surrounding icm .",
    "one idea is that bubbles inflated by agn jets move outward in a cluster by buoyancy and mix the surrounding icm @xcite . as a result of the mixing , hot icm in the outer region of the cluster",
    "is brought into , and subsequently heats , the cluster center .",
    "the other idea is that the dissipation of sound waves created through the agn activities .",
    "in fact , sound waves or weak shocks that may have evolved from sound waves are observed in the perseus and the virgo clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the viscous dissipation of the sound waves is responsible for the heating of a cool core .",
    "they estimated the dissipation rate assuming that the waves are linear .",
    "however , when the amplitude of sound waves is large , the waves rapidly evolve into non - linear weak shocks @xcite , and their dissipation can be faster than the viscous dissipation of linear waves . although @xcite argued the presence of weak shocks , their evolution from sound waves was not considered .",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulations of dissipation of sound waves created by agn activities .",
    "their results actually showed that the sound waves became weak shocks .",
    "however , their simulations were finished before radiative cooling became effective .",
    "thus , the long - term balance between heating and cooling is still unknown . in this letter",
    ", we consider the evolution of sound waves to weak shocks , and analytically estimate the ` time - averaged ' energy flux of the propagating waves as a function of distance , explicitly taking account of the dissipation at weak shock fronts and its global balance with radiative cooling .",

    "these waves , having a relatively large but finite amplitude , eventually form shocks to shape sawtooth waves @xcite .",
    "if the velocity amplitude is larger than @xmath3 sound velocity ( the mach number is @xmath4 ) , those waves steepen and become weak shocks after propagating less than a few wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec : intro ] . for comparison",
    ", we show the results of a genuine cooling flow model ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath70 ) and the _ chandra _ observations of the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : alpha]a and  [ fig : alpha]b show that only a small region is heated .",
    "the jumps of @xmath22 and @xmath25 at @xmath73  kpc are produced by weak shock waves that start to dissipate there .",
    "the energy of the sound waves rapidly dissipates at the shocks , which is clearly illustrated in short dissipation lengths , @xmath74@xmath75  kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha]c ) .",

    "[ fig : alpha ] , the icm density becomes large and the temperature becomes small at @xmath80 so that the rapid shock dissipation is balanced with radiative cooling . because of this , waves can not reproduce the observed temperature and density profiles that gradually change on a scale of @xmath81  kpc . note that the density peaks in figures  [ fig : alpha]b indicates that the solutions are unstable . in an actual cluster , this would lead to convection , and the icm would be heated through the convection rather than the dissipation of sound waves alone .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tau ] , we present the results when @xmath82  yr . compared with the case of @xmath83  yr , the wave energy dissipates in outer regions",
    ". however , the dissipation lengths are still smaller than the cluster core size ( @xmath81  kpc ) .",
    "note that larger @xmath45 ( or @xmath55 ) means formation of larger bubbles . as indicated by @xcite , it is unlikely that the size of the bubbles becomes much larger than 20  kpc ; the bubbles start rising through buoyancy before they become larger . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath84  yr ( @xmath85  kpc ) , the waves heat only the icm around the cluster center .",
    "the predicted temperature and density profiles are obviously inconsistent with the observations .",
    "the inclusion of thermal conduction changes the situation dramatically .",
    "figure  [ fig : fc ] shows the results when @xmath86 .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is based on the study of @xcite .",
    "the models including both wave heating and thermal conduction can well reproduce the observed temperature and density profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : fc]c shows the contribution of the wave heating ( @xmath87 ) to compensating radiative cooling ( @xmath88 ) . since @xmath89 for @xmath9030  kpc , the wave heating is more effective than the thermal conduction in that region .",
    "we showed that sound waves created by the central agn alone can not reproduce the observed temperature and density profiles of a cluster , because the dissipation length of the waves is much smaller than the size of a cluster core and the waves can not heat the whole core .",
    "the same problem has been known for models of solar - corona heating by sound waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the problem of the short dissipation length should also be studied for other heating models including the bubble motion in clusters . on the other hand",
    ", we found that if we include thermal conduction from the hot outer layer of a cluster with the conductivity of 20% of the spitzer value , the observed temperature and density profiles can be reproduced .",
    "the idea of the `` double heating '' ( agn plus thermal conduction ) was proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , the fine structures observed in cluster cores may show that the actual conductivity is much smaller than that we assumed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the structures would soon be erased , if the conductivity is that large .",
    "if the conductivity is small , we need to consider other possibilities . while we considered successive minor agn activities",
    ", some authors consider that rare major agn activities should be responsible for heating of cool cores @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "powerful bursts of the central agn excite strong shocks and heat the surrounding gas in the inner region of a cluster on a timescale of @xmath91  yr . in fact , @xcite found such a violent activity in a distant cluster .",
    "moreover , in this scenario , heating and cooling are not necessarily balanced at a given time , although they must be balanced on a very long - term average .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there is no correlation between the masses of black holes in the central agns and the x - ray luminosities of the central regions of the clusters @xcite .",
    "alternative idea is that cluster mergers are responsible for heating of cool cores @xcite . in this `` tsunami '' model ,",
    "bulk gas motions excited by cluster mergers produce turbulence in and around a core , because the cooling heavy core can not be moved by the bulk gas motions , and the resultant relative gas motion between the core and the surrounding gas induces hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the core is heated by turbulent diffusion from the hot outer region of the cluster . since the turbulence is produced and the heating is effective only when the core is cooling and dense , fine - tuning of balance between cooling and heating is alleviated for this model .",
