    "rigorous derivations of heat conduction laws for mechanical particle models coupled to heat reservoirs remain a mathematical challenge .",
    "a variety of models have been introduced in the past @xcite ; nearly all of the proposed derivations of the fourier law are partial solutions based on unproven assumptions @xcite .",
    "developing proofs of these assumptions would require deep understanding of the properties of systems in non - equilibrium , i.e. , coupled to several unequal heat reservoirs .",
    "the standard assumptions include the existence of the unique invariant measure ( steady state ) as well as certain bounds on the rates of convergence of initial distributions to the invariant measure .    for systems in equilibrium ,",
    "i.e. , when the temperatures of all the reservoirs are the same , the steady states can often be written down explicitly .",
    "the question of existence of non - equilibrium steady states has been open for practically all mechanical particle systems , by which we mean hamiltonian - like systems , driven by stochastic heat reservoirs .",
    "the main difficulty lies in dealing with the non - compactness of the phase space . for the systems under consideration",
    ", however , it is relatively easy to envision scenarios under which particles slow down ( freezing ) or speed up ( heating ) due to stochasticity of the heat reservoirs .",
    "this may push initial distributions towards zero or infinite energy levels and ultimately violate existence of physically relevant steady states .",
    "an example of freezing has been observed ( numerically ) in one of the proposed models @xcite . in that model",
    ", a particle acquires very low values of the speed once in a while under the evolution of the dynamics ( due to stochasticity ) .",
    "low values of the speed lead to long traveling times between collisions during which the particle has no influence on the evolution of the system .",
    "it is observed for the system in @xcite that more and more particles get stuck on the low energy states resulting in fewer and fewer collisions per unit time . to rule out such unfortunate scenarios one must be able to control the probabilities of particles acquiring low speeds and the rates at which the speeds recover to normal ranges .",
    "the dynamics of the mechanical particle systems driven by heat reservoirs may be viewed as a continuous - time markov process .",
    "harris ergodic theorem and its generalizations are common tools for obtaining existence and uniqueness of the steady states as well as ( exponential ) convergence of initial distributions to the steady state .",
    "in discrete time , the theorem requires two things : to produce a non - negative potential @xmath0 ( lyapunov function ) on the phase space which , on average , decreases as a power law under the push forwards of the dynamics , and , given such a @xmath0 , to show minorization or doeblin s condition on certain level set of @xmath0 .",
    "the first condition guarantees that the dynamics enters the center of the phase space , a certain level sets of @xmath0 , with good control on the rates ; and , once at the center , coupling is guaranteed by the minorization condition .",
    "ergodic theorem was applied in @xcite for a discretization of the original continuous - time markov process . in @xcite",
    "the results were extended to continuous time .",
    "the existence of a unique steady state was obtained by constructing a suspension flow over the discrete dynamics ; convergence of initial distributions to the steady state followed from a result in general state space markov process theory @xcite once irreducibility of time-@xmath1 discrete process was shown .",
    "in addition , @xcite demonstrated that this convergence is sub - exponential for a class of initial distributions .",
    "the slow rates of convergence are due to the abundance of slow particles in the system which , in turn , do not influence the system for extended periods of time .",
    "this slows the rates of mixing .",
    "the analysis in @xcite relies heavily on the fact that there exists a meaningful discretization of the system that mixes exponentially fast .",
    "because particles do not interact , the study of the dynamics of one particle on the collision manifold reveals important dynamical properties that yield implications for the continuous - time system . for an interacting particle system , the rates of mixing for the continuous - time system and its relevant discretizations happen to be comparable due to the slow particle effect .",
    "sub - exponential mixing seems to be prevalent for canonical interacting particle systems driven by gibbs heat reservoirs .",
    "if a discrete system does not mix exponentially , finding the potential @xmath0 that would still guarantee existence of invariant measures is a very diligent task requiring extremely good understanding of the dynamics of the system .",
    "thus , one needs different methods to tackle the question of existence of non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "the paper of meyn and tweedie @xcite provides a general framework of showing existence of invariant probability measures for general state space markov processes .    in this paper",
    "we consider a class of mechanical systems in which particles interact with an energy tank represented by a rotating disk anchored at the center .",
    "particles move freely between collisions with the tank or the boundary . when a particle collides with the disk , an energy exchange occurs , in which the particle exchanges the tangential component of its velocity with the angular velocity of the disk and the normal component of the particle s velocity changes sign .",
    "a system in this class is coupled to heat reservoirs set at possibly different temperatures that absorb particles when they collide with the boundaries of the reservoirs and emit new particles according to the gibbs distribution corresponding to the temperatures of the reservoirs .",
    "the main geometric assumption that makes the analysis feasible is that a particle can hit the disk at most once before returning to the heat reservoir .",
    "the existence is shown in section [ sect : existence ] through estimating hitting times of a carefully chosen compact set @xmath2 in continuous time without an aid of a discretization or a potential .",
    "a regeneration times idea is employed in the argument . in order to apply a general state space markov process theory developed in @xcite ,",
    "one also needs to show that the minorization condition holds on @xmath2 , which we do in [ subsect : c petite ] .",
    "convergence of initial distributions to the steady state follows by application of a theorem in @xcite after a small modification of the minorization condition argument . in section [",
    "sect : non exp mixing ] we show that mixing is not exponential and for a large class of initial distribution convergence of initial distributions to the steady state occurs at sub - exponential rates .",
    "the argument is similar to @xcite .",
    "however , we can not use the potential @xmath0 for certain upper bound estimates and different methods are required .",
    "the key property that leads to sub - exponential mixing is that the ( invariant ) measure of the states for which at least one particle will not collide with a heat reservoir or a disk in time @xmath3 is of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics thus resembles one of an expanding map with a neutral fixed point and sub - exponential convergence rates for a class of initial distributions can be obtained using arguments similar to @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the measure of the particles that will not collide with a heat reservoir or a disk in time @xmath3 are obtained using the minorization condition and other properties of the dynamics .",
    "let @xmath5 be a circular domain of radius @xmath6 .",
    "a disk @xmath7 is anchored at the center of @xmath8 .",
    "the disk @xmath7 is allowed to rotate freely with angular velocity @xmath9 ; denote by @xmath10 a position of a marked point on @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be two vertical walls on the top and on the bottom of @xmath7 , splitting @xmath14 into two halves , left and right .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : manyparticles ] .",
    "our system consists of @xmath15 particles in @xmath14 with positions @xmath16 and velocities @xmath17 .",
    "the particles are confined to either of the two halves and move freely between collisions with @xmath18 . the collisions with @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are specular , i.e. , the angles of incidence are equal to the angles of reflection .",
    "when a particle collides with the boundary of the disk @xmath11 , an energy exchange occurs , in which the particle exchanges the tangential component of its velocity with the angular velocity of the disk and the normal component of the particle s velocity changes sign . more precisely , if @xmath19 is the particle s velocity decomposition upon collision with @xmath11 and the disk rotates with angular velocity @xmath9 , then the post - collision velocities are : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the particles velocity decomposition and @xmath22 is the disk s angular velocity immediately after the collision .",
    "this interaction was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the left and right parts of @xmath8 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , act as heat baths at possibly different temperatures @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "particles get absorbed by the heat baths upon collision with @xmath8 , and , upon collision of a particle with the disk , a new particle is emitted immediately at the collision location with speed @xmath27 and angle @xmath28 distributed according to @xmath29 @xmath30 , where @xmath31 or @xmath32 depending on whether the particle is confined to the left or the right half of @xmath5 .",
    "this distribution on the boundary @xmath8 corresponds to particle s velocity distributed as @xmath33 in @xmath5 .",
    "we would like to define the associated markov process with the dynamical rules governed as above .",
    "a phase space for such a process should consist of quadruples @xmath34 with proper identifications at the collisions .",
    "in particular , when @xmath35 , if @xmath36 has positive ( negative ) horizontal component , then the corresponding particle is confined to the right ( left ) half of the domain @xmath14 . to simplify the notation ,",
    "we would like to exclude states @xmath37 for some @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath36 has zero horizontal component@xmath40 from the phase space . in our future arguments",
    "we will frequently omit mentioning the situation of particles reflecting from @xmath41 : due to symmetry and circular shape of @xmath5 , the distance of flight is the same whether reflection occurs or not .",
    "in addition , we would like to exclude all the states with stopped particles ( @xmath42 for some @xmath38 ) and all the states that lead to such with positive probability .",
    "a particle stops if it collides tangentially with a stopped disk ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "consequently , any state @xmath34 with a particle heading for a tangential collision may lead to positive probability of stopping a particle as time evolves .",

    "note that @xmath46 is locally compact and separable , and @xmath45 has strongly markov with right - continuous sample paths because we chose to keep track of the outgoing velocities are collisions .",
