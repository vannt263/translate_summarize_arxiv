    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars without hydrogen in their spectra are helium stars ( * ? ? ? * for a review see ) .",
    "wr / x - ray binaries are composed of a helium star and a compact star , which can be a neutron star or black hole . at present seven wr / x - ray binaries",
    "are known or suspected , all except one in external galaxies ; in six cases the orbital periods range from 0.2 days to about 1.5 day ; one system has a period of about 8 days @xcite.these systems are expected to be the outcome of the later evolution of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) when the evolved massive donor stars in these systems have started to overflow their roche lobes .",
    "if the systems do not merge , the outcome of this later evolution is expected to be a very close binary consisting of a helium star - the helium core of the original donor- and the compact star ( see , who suggested that the peculiar 4.8-hour period x - ray binary cyg x-3 is such a system , ( which is indeed the case , as its companion is a wr star of type wn5 , as shown by @xcite ) . when this prediction of spiral - in was made ( we use here the expression `` spiral - in '' for a drastic decrease of the orbital period , due to any kind of mechanism )",
    ", it was thought that helium stars with masses @xmath2@xmath3would be observable as wr stars , but measurements of masses of wr stars in binaries have since shown that , in order to show the typical wr spectral characteristics ( strong emission lines of ionized he , c and o , produced by a dense high - velocity stellar wind outflow ) , the helium stars must have a mass @xmath4@xmath3 .",
    "this implies that the hydrogen - rich progenitor of the wr star must have had a mass @xmath5 .",
    "there are very few hmxbs known with such a large donor star mass : in our galaxy only 4u1223 -62 ( gx301 - 4 ) and 4u1700 - 37 .",
    "unfortunately , the compact stars in these systems have rather low masses , of order 1.5 and @xmath6@xmath3 , respectively , which will make their survival of spiral - in impossible , as will be shown later in this paper",
    ".    we will show that , on the other hand , if the compact star is a black hole , with a mass @xmath7 , the systems may survive spiral - in , and become close binaries consisting of a wr star and a black hole .",
    "for this reason , one expects in general that in wr / x - ray binaries the compact star is a black hole .",
    "we show here that there are two different mechanisms by which the final episode of mass transfer in the black - hole hmxb can take place :    * in systems in which the donor star has a radiative envelope when it begins to overflow its roche lobe , no common envelope will form , provided the mass ratio of donor star and accretor is not larger than about 3 to 4 @xcite .",
    "( we will assume in this paper that this limiting mass ratio is 3.5 ) .",
    "the donor then keeps slightly overfilling its roche lobe and transfers matter on a thermal timescale at a high rate .",
    "this results in the formation of a thick accretion disk around the compact star , from where the mass is lost from the system at a high rate , as is shown by the system of ss433 @xcite . in most cases with a black hole compact star",
    "this type of evolution leads to spiral in , but the orbital shrinking is moderate and depends on the initial mass ratio of the system . * in systems with a donor with a radiative envelope , but mass ratio larger than 3.5 , or in which the donor has a convective envelope at the time it begins to overflow its roche lobe , a common envelope will form in which the compact star and the dense evolved core of the donor spiral down towards each other due to the large frictional energy dissipation by their motions in the envelope .",
    "we show here that this first mode can be important for the formation of short - period wr / x - ray binaries and , subsequently , close double black holes , and may occur over quite a wide range of initial orbital periods of binaries , from one week to well over one year .",
    "we show that also the second mode , for donors with radiative envelopes , can lead to double black holes , in this case with very short orbital periods of less than one day .",
    "section 2 considers the first above - mentioned mode of spiral - in in more detail , and section 3 considers common envelope evolution , and examines in which regime of binary periods each of the modes is expected to be dominant . in this section",
    "some examples are given of how a number of well - known observed wr+o binaries with relatively short orbital periods are expected to evolve in the future , and are expected to produce close double black holes .",
    "the ss433 system consists of a roche - lobe filling a4 - 7i supergiant donor star with an estimated mass of @xmath8 and a luminosity of about 3800@xmath9 , plus a compact star with a mass of @xmath10 , in a 13.1-day period binary @xcite .",
    "the compact star is surrounded by an extended and luminous accretion disk , about an order of magnitude brighter than its a - supergiant companion .",
    "this disk ejects the famous precessing relativistic jets with a velocity of 0.265c , in which neutral hydrogen is ejected at a rate of some @xmath11@xmath12 , while in a strong disk wind with a velocity of about 1500@xmath13of order some @xmath14@xmath12is ejected , as is seen in the form of the ` stationary ' h@xmath15 line and broad absorption lines @xcite .",
    "the total mass loss from the disk is basically all the matter that the a - supergiant donor is transferring to the compact object by roche - lobe overflow on its thermal timescale of @xmath16 years ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observed radiative accretion luminosity of the compact star with its disk does not exceed the eddington luminosity @xmath17@xmath18of the compact star ( which corresponds to a real accretion rate onto the compact star of order only a few times @xmath19@xmath12 ) , although when seen along the jets the uv luminosity might be as large as perhaps @xmath20@xmath18@xcite , which would correspond to an accretion rate of order @xmath21@xmath12 .",
    "this mass loss has been going on for thousands of years , as can be seen from the large radio nebula w50 that surrounds the system and has been produced by the precessing jets and the strong disk wind . even though this mass transfer has been going on for thousands of years",
    ", the system has not entered in a common - envelope ( ce ) state .",
    "the reason why ss433 has not gone into a ce phase is , as explained by @xcite and @xcite , the fact that the a - supergiant star has a radiative envelope .",
    "if one takes away mass from a star with radiative envelope , this envelope responds by shrinking on a dynamical timescale , followed by a re - expansion on the thermal timescale of the envelope . as a result ,",
    "this star can keep its radius close to that of its roche lobe and will transfer matter to its companion on the thermal timescale of its envelope , without going into a ce phase .",
    "there is , however , the caveat that this thermal timescale mass - transfer from a radiative donor envelope may itself become unstable ,",
    "if the mass ratio of donor and companion star is larger than about 3 to 4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that ss433 did avoid going into a ce therefore implies that its mass ratio must be below this limit , which we will here assume to be 3.5 . with",
    "the above given ranges for the estimated masses of donor and accretor of s433 , a combination of masses that is expected to fulfill this condition is : a 10@xmath3 donor and a 3.6@xmath3compact star .",
    "in this paper we will , for the sake of argument , assume that these are the masses of the components of this system .",
    "on the other hand , for systems with a donor with a radiative envelope and mass ratio larger than 3.5 or if the donor star has a convective envelope , the formation of a common envelope is unavoidable .",
    "the reaction of a convective envelope to mass loss is expansion on a dynamical ( pulsational ) timescale , and thus the envelope becomes violently unstable , which leads to runaway mass transfer and the formation of a common envelope .",
    "as shown by @xcite , in the case of roche - lobe overflow from donor stars with a radiative envelope , a further condition for avoiding the formation of a common envelope is that the spherization radius @xmath22 of the accreting compact object remains smaller than its roche lobe , where @xmath22 is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius of the compact object . in the case of ss433",
    ", @xmath25 is of order @xmath26 and @xmath27@xmath28 , so @xmath29@xmath28@xmath30@xmath31 , which is deep inside the roche lobe of the compact star , and a ce will be avoided . in all hmxbs with orbital periods",
    "upward on one day the same will hold .",
    "so in all cases of hmxb systems with a donor with a radiative envelope and mass ratio less than about 3.5 , one expects the system to go into normal roche - lobe overflow evolution similar to that of ss433 .",
    "the `` ss433-mode '' of mass transfer is what we have in the past called `` isotropic re - emission '' .    with the ss433-mode of mass transfer , followed by mass loss from the disk , which has the specific orbital angular momentum of the compact object , it is simple to calculate how the orbit of the system will change . in case that a fraction  of the transferred matter is ejected from the compact star and its disk with the specific orbital angular momentum of this star , and a fraction @xmath32",
    "is accreted by this star , the orbital angular momentum loss leads to a change of the orbital radius a given by : @xmath33^{-3 - 2/(1-\\beta)},\\ ] ] where q is the mass ratio of donor and compact star , and subscript zero indicates the initial situation at the onset of roche - lobe overflow .    for the case in which in which @xmath34 , as is in fact the case in ss433 , as the accreted amount is @xmath14 to @xmath35 times the transferred amount , this equation in the limit of @xmath36 approaching unity simplifies to : @xmath37 using kepler s third law",
    "the corresponding equation for the change of the orbital period is : @xmath38    in the case of ss433 , assuming the initial mass of the a - supergiant donor to have been @xmath39 to @xmath40 , the mass of its helium core is about 2.7@xmath3 .",
    "this means that at the end of the roche - lobe overflow phase @xmath41 , while at present @xmath42 . inserting these values into equation ( 4 )",
    ", one finds that at the end of the roche - lobe overflow the orbital period of the system will be @xmath43 days .",
    "so , ss433 will with these assumed component masses finish as a detached binary consisting of a 2.7@xmath3 helium star and a 3.6@xmath3compact star .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] depicts how the orbital period of ss433 is expected to change as a function of its decreasing donor mass .",
    "the entire process will take place on the thermal timescale of the envelope of the 10@xmath3a - supergiant which is between @xmath44 and @xmath16 years .",
    "donor star ( with a 2.7@xmath3helium core ) , and a 3.6@xmath3 compact star , consistent with the values measured by hillwig et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the mass ratio chosen to assure stable roche - lobe overflow . for cyg x-1 we adopted a donor mass of 19@xmath3(with a 10@xmath3helium core , and a 14.8@xmath3compact star ) in a 5.6day orbit .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the helium star in the resulting system will during helium shell burning go through a second mass transfer phase and finally explode as a supernova , likely leaving a neutron star . if the system remains bound in response to the natal kick of the neutron star , a close eccentric binary will result , consisting of the present @xmath45@xmath3 compact star plus a neutron star .",
    "one may wonder what is so special about ss433 and why we do not see more ss433-like systems .",
    "we propose that the answer is : the very unusual combination for a hmxb of a rather low donor mass ( presently @xmath46@xmath3and initially @xmath47@xmath3 ) plus a quite massive compact star ( @xmath45@xmath3 ) .",
    "an 11 to 12@xmath3initial donor mass and an orbital period of @xmath48days are typical for a be / x - ray binary , the most common type of hmxb , containing a b - emission ( be ) line star .",
    "there are known some 200 be / x - ray binaries in our galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "list 160 in our galaxy and the two magellanic clouds and lists 141 in our galaxy plus the smc alone .",
    "since these papers appeared , swift , integral and other satellites have discovered several tens more , bringing the total presently known number to about 200 . in all but one of the known be / x - ray binaries , the compact stars are neutron stars which have a typical mass of about 1.4@xmath3 .",
    "only one b - e / x - ray binary is known to harbor probably a black hole companion , with a mass of 3.6 to 6.9@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if the companion of a 12@xmath3be star is a 1.4@xmath3neutron star , the value of @xmath49 in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is 8.57 , and the formation of a common envelope is unavoidable , and the two stars will merge , as will be shown below .",
    "only if the compact star has a mass @xmath50@xmath3or larger , the system will spiral in slowly and survive the ss433-like mass - transfer process .",
    "therefore , out of the @xmath51 be / x - ray binaries , only the one system with an ( alleged ) black hole companion will in the future evolve like ss433 and survive , all the others will have merged after transferring only a small amount of mass .",
    "so , the birthrate of ss433-like systems is at most about 0.5 per cent of the birthrate of be / x - ray binaries .",
    "( for a model for the formation and future evolution of the possible be / black - hole binary , see * ? ? ?",
    "the simple reason why ss433 can stably survive this type of spiral - in process for @xmath52  to perhaps @xmath53  years is because of its unique combination  for a be / x - ray binary progenitor  of a quite massive compact star and a relatively moderate - mass donor star .",
    "the @xmath45@xmath3compact object in ss433 must be a low - mass black hole , because causality allows neutron stars to have masses not larger than about 3@xmath3 @xcite .      in order to determine the limiting orbital period for having a radiative envelope",
    ", we notice that for an effective temperature @xmath54k ( spectral type earlier than @xmath55a7 ) , stars have a radiative envelope ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",

    "if the mass @xmath59 of the compact companion of the star is known , and we set the stellar radius @xmath56 equal to the radius @xmath60 of the roche lobe of the donor , then the equation for the roche lobe given by @xcite : @xmath61 allows one to calculate the orbital radius @xmath62 of the binary in which the donor fills its roche lobe , as the mass ratio @xmath63 is known . using kepler s third law , one also calculate the corresponding orbital period @xmath64 . to calculate the maximum orbital periods up",
    "to which donor stars still have a radiative envelope , we used the luminosities of post - main - sequence evolutionary tracks , for solar metallicity , of rotating stars with masses up to 50@xmath3given by , and the limiting effective temperature of @xmath65k .",
    "post - main - sequence stars originating from stars more massive than about 50@xmath3become luminous blue variables , stars that experience strong eruptive mass loss episodes .",
    "because of their strong mass loss they lose most of their hydrogen - rich envelope and always stay at effective temperatures above 8100k .",
    "therefore these post - main sequence stars are expected to have radiative envelopes , so for them we used as maximum radius just their maximum post - main - sequence stellar radius .",
    "we made these calculations for compact companions with masses of 1.5@xmath3 , 5@xmath3 , 10@xmath3and 15@xmath3 .",

    "( in the mass range between 40@xmath3and 60@xmath3there are no tracks by available .",
    "it is known from evolutionary calculations with similar assumed wind mass loss rates that for masses above 50@xmath3the stars at the end of hydrogen burning have lost most of their h - rich envelopes and their radii drop rapidly as a function of mass .",
    "we have , for the sake of argument , assumed that in the mass range between 40 and 50@xmath3the orbital periods at @xmath66k are constant and after that they linearly decrease towards the orbital period of the 60@xmath3star ) .",

    "( compare with figure  [ fig:2 ] , where we showed the case of a @xmath69@xmath3neutron star companion ) .",
    "the region is bound by the condition that the mass ratio between the donor and the compact object is not too extreme , i.e.  smaller than @xmath70 ( vertical dashed gray line ) .",
    "systems in the part to the right of the blue region will go into ce evolution .",

    "[ fig:3],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the next question is : which systems with donor stars in this radiative - envelope regime , will survive as binaries after the onset of mass transfer by roche - lobe overflow ?",
    "it turns out that none of the systems with a 1.5@xmath3compact star ( neutron star ) will , as was already mentioned above . because of their mass ratios of far above the mass ratio upper limit of 3.5",
    ", they go into ce evolution and for initial donor masses below 40 @xmath3 they all merge .",
    "this can be seen from the lower - limit curve for survival of ce evolution ( the red curve ) in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "( the way this curve was calculated is explained in the next section ) .",
    "although for donor masses larger than 40@xmath3according to the figure systems might survive ce - evolution ( grey hashed region ) , such massive donors with ns companions may not be very likely , for stellar evolution reasons . in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we have indicated also the ranges of orbital periods and masses of the bulk of the known supergiant hmxbs with neutron star companions , and of the b - emission x - ray binaries with neutron star companions .",
    "one observes that the vast majority of the known supergiant hmxbs with neutron stars does not survive spiral - in .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that among the known types of hmxbs only the b - emission x - ray binaries with a neutron star companion and orbital periods ranging from larger than 220d with a 9@xmath3donor to larger than 370d with a 20@xmath3donor ( the red region of the diagram ) , will survive spiral in and can later form double neutron stars , after explosion of the helium star .",
    "this is a well - known result .",
    "while none of the systems in the radiative - donor regime with a 1.5@xmath3neutron star survives the mass transfer , the systems with a 5@xmath3 , 10@xmath3and 15@xmath3compact companion star ( black hole ) , in the blue - colored parts of figure[fig:3 ] , do survive ss433-like mass transfer and can produce helium - star binaries with relatively short orbital periods : wr / x - ray binaries .    it should be kept in mind that for the case with a 5@xmath3 , 10@xmath3and 15@xmath3compact star , the donors which we consider , overflow their roche lobes after leaving the main sequence , which means that they evolve according to case b of close binary evolution @xcite .",
    "the lower limit for the orbital period for this case is about one week .",
    "an example of a system that will survive ss433-like evolution is cygnus x-1 ( which has 5.6 day orbital period , a @xmath71 black hole and a @xmath72 donor , which according to its luminosity must have started out as a 30@xmath3star @xcite .",
    "after ss433-like mass transfer the donor in cygnus x-1 will leave a helium star of about 10@xmath3 , which might either leave a neutron star or a low - mass black hole , with an orbital period of about 9 days , depending on the direction and magnitude of the birth kick of the compact object .",
    "so cyg x-1 will not terminate as a close system . in figure 1 the expected future evolution of its orbit",
    "is depicted .",
    "systems with orbital periods above the upper - limit line for radiative envelope in figures  [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] will have convective envelopes and will , when their donor stars overflow their roche lobes , go into ce evolution and spiral in , as described e.g. by @xcite , , @xcite and later papers and recently by @xcite .",
    "the same holds for systems with donors in the radiative region and mass ratios larger than about 3.5 .",
    "we use here the formalism for the orbital change in the case of ce evolution as given by @xcite and @xcite , which yields a ratio of the final and initial orbital radii @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , given by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mass of the helium core of the donor , @xmath77 is the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope of the donor at the moment when roche - lobe overflow begins , @xmath78 is the so - called `` efficiency factor '' of ce evolution which indicates the efficiency with which the release of orbital gravitational binding energy that occurs during spiral in of the compact star towards the core of the donor is converted into kinetic energy required to eject the common envelope , @xmath79 is a parameter that depends on the stellar mass density distribution and @xmath80 is the ratio of the roche - lobe radius @xmath81 and the orbital radius @xmath82 at the onset of ce evolution .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is typically of order 0.5 .",
    "there are many factors that influence the precise value of the product @xmath83 , such as energy sources like recombination energy and accretion energy release ( e.g. see the discussion in @xcite , and in ) .",

    "in order to estimate the galactic formation rate of double black holes from the channel discussed here , we just give an order of magnitude estimate . in a later paper",
    "we will make more refined estimates by means of binary population synthesis .",
    "we consider here the number of stars in the galaxy with masses larger than 25@xmath3 , as these are the stars that are expected to produce wr stars ( see section 1 ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the number of o - b2 stars in the galaxy as 60 000 .",
    "as the mass of a b2 main - sequence star is 10@xmath3 , one finds that with a salpeter imf , combined with a massive star lifetime proportional to @xmath100 , that there are about 3000 stars more massive than 25@xmath3 in the galaxy .",
    "one obtains about the same number if one assumes the number of 6000 o - stars in the galaxy estimated by @xcite , taking into account that main - sequence o - stars have masses upwards from 20@xmath3 . however , this number of 3000 stars can not be correct , because the number of wr stars in the galaxy is already at least 2000 .",
    "@xcite estimates this number to be even as large as 6500 .",
    "this is probably an overestimate , but the new 2016 wr catalogue of paul crowther , which is an update of @xcite , lists 634 wr stars of which of order 500 are in our galaxy . assuming the incompleteness factor of this catalogue for our galaxy to be at least a factor of 4 ( as interstellar extinction obscures a considerable number of the stars at large distances , despite the large intrinsic brightness of wr stars ) , the total number of wr stars in our galaxy is at least 2000 .",
    "since wr stars live about 10 per cent of the  4 million years lifetime of their o - star progenitors , one then expects , in a steady state of star formation , the number of o - stars more massive than 25@xmath3 in the galaxy to be at least 20 000 : some 7 times larger than the above - cited earlier estimates .",
    "we will assume here that the number of stars more massive than 25 @xmath3 in the galaxy is 20 000 .",
    "@xcite find that the percentage of interacting binaries among massive stars is close to 100 per cent . from the orbital period distribution of 50 unevolved o - type spectroscopic binaries that these authors determined",
    ", one sees that some 9 have orbital periods between 7 and 20days .",
    "these are expected to evolve following case b of close binary evolution .",
    "about 50 per cent of the binaries have mass ratios @xmath101 , such that they evolve with close to conservative mass transfer , producing wr+o binaries with orbital periods in the range roughly between 7 and 40days , which produce in the end two black holes that do not differ much in mass .",
    "so , in total 9 per cent ( 50 per cent of 18 per cent ) of the massive stars produce wr+o binaries with relatively short orbital periods , between 7 and 40 days .",
    "this 9 per cent means : 1800 o - type binaries , which produce - in a steady state- at any time 180 wr+o binaries ( as the lifetime of wr stars is 10 per cent of the lifetime of o - stars ) , which then produce a steady population 1350 bh+o binaries ( assuming the post - mass - transfer o - star companions to live 3 million years on the main sequence ) .",
    "the x - ray lifetime of the latter systems ( when the o - stars have left the main sequence and almost fill their roche lobe and produce a strong stellar wind ) is of order 50 000 to 100 000 years , such that in a steady state there will be between 22 and 45 bh - hmxbs in our galaxy .",
    "( notice that this number predicts - with an even spread of these hmxbs throughout the galactic disk with a radius of 14kpc- that there should be about 0.5 to 1 bh - hmxbs within 2kpc from the sun .",
    "we do , indeed , observe one such system within 2kpc from the sun : cygnus x-1 ) .",
    "the bh+o binaries in which the mass ratio of o - star and bh is @xmath102 , are expected to evolve later in life according to the ss433-mode of spiral after their x - ray binary phase .",
    "figure 4 suggests , with a 10@xmath3bh companion , that perhaps about 10 per cent of the bh+o systems are located in the blue region of the diagram and make wr / x - ray binaries byisotropic re - emission \" mass transfer . of the remaining systems , with mass ratios @xmath103 , which go into ce evolution , some 10 per cent may have orbital periods long enough to survive",
    "ce ( as illustrated by tables 1 and 2 and figure 4 ) with very short orbital periods , of less than a day . assuming thus that some 10 per cent of the bh+o binaries survive as wr / x - ray binaries - half of them with very short orbital periods- this amounts to 135 of the bh+o systems present in a steady state .",
    "as the wr / x - ray binaries live 7.5 times shorter than the 3 million year lifetime of their progenitors , one expects in a steady state at any time 18 wr / x - ray binaries to be present in our galaxy , half of them with periods less than a day",
    ". these systems will produce double black holes with typical masses around 10@xmath3 , half of them with orbital periods less than a day , which will merge within a hubble time .",
    "with 9 such wr - systems with a typical lifetime of 400 000 years one expects this merger rate in the galaxy to be of order once per 50 000 years .    if we compare the predicted number of wr / x - ray binaries in our galaxy with the observations , we notice that we know only one such system in our galaxy : cygnus x-3 , which has an orbital period of 0.2 days .",
    "this system is an extremely strong x - ray source , with an x - ray luminosity @xmath104@xmath18 .",
    "it is close to the galactic plane , at a distance of about 10kpc , behind 3 spiral arms , as determined from 3 different hi - absorption lines during its giant radio outbursts .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a wind - accreting system like cyg x-3 is proportional to @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the stellar wind velocity near the compact star and @xmath62 is the orbital radius .",
    "the reason why cyg x-3 is such a strong x - ray source is two - fold : ( i ) due to the small distance of the compact star from the surface of the wr star , causing it to be in the low - velocity part of the stellar wind , and ( ii ) its small orbital radius .",
    "a wr / x - ray binary with the same masses of the components , but an orbital period of one day will have a 3 times wider orbit , such that already alone because of this its x - ray luminosity will be an order of magnitude smaller . since its accretor will also be in a higher - velocity part of the wind",
    ", its x - ray luminosity will be still smaller than that , probably not more than @xmath107@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , other wr / x - ray binaries in our galaxy , if they exist , will in general be much less prominent as x - ray sources than cyg x-3 , and due to the large extinction near the galactic plane , hard to distinguish from other types of x - ray sources .",
    "it thus seems that our predicted number of such system of about 18 is not ruled out by the observations .",
    "the estimates of the relative importance of this formation channel of double black holes made in the last section are very rough and need , of course , refinement through full binary population synthesis evolution simulations .",
    "this is a next step to be carried out . also , we only considered here evolution with solar metallicity , as the galactic wr binaries are young and therefore have high metallicity .",
    "it is obvious that if evolution with lower metallicity would be considered , the outcome could have been quite different , as more massive black holes will be produced due to the weaker stellar wind mass loss during the evolution of massive stars .",
    "this is also a refinement that will have to be included in the binary population synthesis models in the future .",
    "further , as mentioned above , it is crucial to make detailed binary evolution calculations for black - hole hmxbs with different mass ratios of donor and accretor , in order to estimate , as a function of donor mass , the precise upper limit of the mass ratio up to which the ss433-like mass transfer from a companion with a radiative envelope can proceed stably .",
    "this limit is of crucial importance for estimating the precise birth rate of wr x - ray binaries and double black holes resulting for this type of evolution .",
    "nevertheless , as we have shown , massive binaries of all kinds of orbital periods may contribute to the formation of close double black hole binaries , and not only the very wide systems that go into common - envelope evolution ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the very close systems that evolve homogeneously .",
