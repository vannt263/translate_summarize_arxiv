    "the behavior of ions in liquids , or more specifically , in aqueous solutions near charged surfaces , largely contributes to our understanding of colloidal interactions  @xcite , transport in nano- and micro - pores  @xcite , and electrochemical processes  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the ionic profiles have been calculated using the poisson ",
    "boltzmann  ( pb ) model  @xcite , which includes electrostatic interactions and entropy of mobile ions dispersed in a continuum medium of uniform permittivity , @xmath2 . the pb model captures the formation of the so - called electric double layer  ( edl ) close to a charged surface , where the counter - ions are loosely associated with the surface . at small surface - charge densities ,",
    "the pb model is quite successful in explaining qualitatively many experimental results .",
    "however , at high surface - charge densities and for multivalent counter - ions , the pb model fails to describe the edl even on a qualitative level  @xcite , and other theories that take into account charge correlations and fluctuations , have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "experiments on differential capacitance at low salt concentrations indicate that the edl width is a decreasing function of the surface potential at low surface charge , in accord with the pb predictions .",
    "however , the pb does not predict correctly the increase in the edl width with the surface potential at higher surface charge  @xcite .",
    "one attempt to explain this qualitative non - pb change of the edl width was to include steric interactions between the ( solvated ) ions  @xcite in the pb model .",
    "in such a _ sterically - modified pb _  ( smpb ) model , the saturation of the counter - ion build - up at the surface reaches closed - packing density at high potentials .",
    "the model further predicts an increase of the edl width with the surface charge ( or equivalently with surface potential ) , at high surface charge conditions , in qualitative accord with experiments .    a second source of counter - ion saturation is caused by the dielectric decrement characteristic to ionic solutions , and is due to the effective polarizability of hydrated ions  @xcite .",
    "this effective polarizability is related to the presence of a hydration shell around ions in addition to the dielectric hole created by the ions themselves .",
    "since ions usually have smaller dielectric constant than water , inclusion of an ion in water creates a dielectric hole that reduces the dielectric constant of the solution .",
    "however , for small and simple ions such as halides , this effect does not have a substantial contribution to the net dielectric decrement . a more significant effect",
    "is due to the hydration shell formed by water molecules in the immediate proximity to an ion . in this layer , the polar water molecules are largely oriented along the electrostatic field created by the ion , reducing the orientational polarizability and leading to a rather pronounced dielectric decrement .",
    "the effective polarizability of hydrated ions in relation with the edl capacitance was first analyzed by bikerman  @xcite , who predicted a shift in the electrocapillary maximum due to the asymmetric effective polarizabilities between the cations and anions .",
    "depletion of a polyelectrolyte caused by dielectric decrement near the surface was pointed out by biesheuvel  @xcite , and the broadening of edl by the dielectric decrement in multivalent ions and mixed electrolytes was reported in refs .  .",
    "the saturation of counter - ion concentration that originates from the reduced permittivity close to the surface is called _",
    "dielectrophoretic saturation _ , and was analyzed for solutions containing only counter - ions that balance the surface charges  @xcite , as well as when salt was added to the solution  @xcite .",
    "first , it was shown that the dielectric decrement can cause a counter - ion saturation at the surface even without including the effect of ion finite size  @xcite .",
    "later , it was pointed out that when the dielectric decrement is large , the dielectrophoretic saturation will be the dominant effect even when the ion finite size is taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the non - monotonic variation of the differential capacitance with the surface charge can be ascribed not only to the ion finite size as predicted by the smpb model , but also to the dielectric decrement  @xcite .",
    "since the counter - ion saturation at high surface charge can result from two different origins , the following two points should be elucidated .",
    "( i ) finding a general criterion to determine the dominant mechanism ( steric or dielectrophoretic ) for the counter - ion saturation for general nonlinear permittivity decrement ; ( ii ) combining the effects of dielectric decrement and ion finite size in order to analyze the differential capacitance , not only for the case of dielectrophoretic counter - ion saturation , but also for the sterically - dominant one .",
    "another issue that needs further attention is the high salt regime .",
    "as the salt concentration increases , the range of the surface potential where the pb model can be applied becomes smaller , and the counter - ion concentration reaches a saturation value even at rather low values of the surface potential . using the smpb model  @xcite , a uni - modal ( or bell - shape ) differential capacitance was predicted at high salt concentration above a threshold , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the salt concentration and @xmath5 is the lattice size , which roughly corresponds to the solvated ion size  @xcite .",
    "we note that a similar bell - shape differential capacitance has been observed experimentally in ionic liquids  @xcite , while another type of bell - shape capacitance was predicted at an electrified oil / water interface due to large organic ions  @xcite",
    ". however , the additional effect of dielectric decrement on the emergence of the bell - shaped differential capacitance has not yet been explored . for ionic solutions ,",
    "the dielectric decrement at high salt concentrations can have a strong effect and , hence , change the camel - shape to bell - shape crossover of the differential capacitance .",
    "in this paper , we study the ionic behavior of an aqueous electrolyte solution in the proximity of a surface having a constant charge density or an externally controlled surface potential .",
