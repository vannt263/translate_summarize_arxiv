    "if a reduction system consists of circles that intersect the axis containing all punctures exactly twice , then it is called a _ standard reduction system_. bernardete , nitecki and guitierrezit @xcite showed that cycling and decycling operations retain a standard reduction system and so @xmath33 must contain a braid with a standard reduction system if @xmath18 is reducible .",

    "consequently , the conjugacy problem for pseudo - anosov braids boils down to that for rigid pseudo - anosov braids . for rigid braids ,",
    "the complexity of the current best solution ultimately relies on the size of the rigid conjugacy set of an input braid .    in this article , we show that there is a family of pseudo - anosov braids independently parameterized by the braid index and the ( canonical ) length whose rigid conjugacy sets grow exponentially in the braid index and linearly in the length and conclude that the conjugacy problem remains exponential in the braid index under current knowledge .",
    "our strategy is to construct a family of rigid @xmath1-braids of canonical length @xmath16 from the set of @xmath57 binary matrices .",
    "then we show that each member of the family carries no standard reduction system and the rigid conjugacy set of each member is a subset of the family and therefore each member is pseudo - anosov .",

    "prasolov @xcite constructed a family of rigid pseudo - anosov @xmath1-braids of canonical length @xmath1 whose rigid conjugacy sets grow exponentially in @xmath1 .",
