    "when considering how carbon could be produced in stellar nucleosynthesis , hoyle @xcite famously predicted that the @xmath1c nucleus must have an excited @xmath0 state in the vicinity of the 3-@xmath3 breakup threshold .",
    "such a state was duly found @xcite in short order on the basis of hoyle s suggestion .",
    "its existence was essential for @xmath1c to be produced at an adequate rate to open up the pathways to the synthesis of still heavier nuclei @xcite .",
    "not only had this state escaped both experimental detection and theoretical prediction up to that point , but it has continued to pose severe challenges to nuclear structure models ever since .",
    "the shell model struggles to describe any low - lying excited @xmath0 states in p - shell and sd - shell nuclei . to this day",
    ", the most advanced no - core shell model has not succeeded in reproducing the excitation energy of the hoyle state @xcite .",
    "models invoking a 3@xmath3 chain @xcite were able to accommodate the excitation energy , but could not reproduce the decay width of the hoyle state .",
    "better success was enjoyed by orthogonality condition model calculations of the 3@xmath3 system , using a semi - microscopic @xmath8 interaction @xcite , which gave a suitably sized @xmath3-decay width in the @xmath2be@xmath9 channel .",
    "this suggested that the dominant structure of the hoyle state must be @xmath2be@xmath9 in a relative s - state .",
    "such a conclusion was backed up by fully microscopic @xmath10 calculations using the resonating group and generator coordinate methods @xcite .",
    "more recently fully microscopic calculations using antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) @xcite have been able to give a good account of the low - lying spectrum of @xmath1c without assuming alpha clustering _ a priori_. for the particular case of the very loosely bound hoyle state",
    "a three-@xmath3 condensate wave function @xcite has also been shown to have a large overlap with the fmd wave function .",
    "the current situation is well summarized in a recent review @xcite .    in parallel with these theoretical developments ,",
    "new life has recently been breathed into the experimental program .",
    "given that the hoyle state has a large mean square radius , it is natural to suggest calculating higher angular momentum states with this same structure thereby producing a band of excited states with a large moment of inertia .",
    "although friedrich et al .",
    "@xcite claim there are no such rotational states , most @xmath10 models do support them , with the @xmath4 state generally expected to have an excitation energy in the region of 10 mev .",
    "initial searches for this @xmath4 state via beta decay @xcite were discouraging , but in recent times three separate experiments have provided evidence of its existence .",
    "itoh et al .",
    "@xcite see a @xmath4 state at 9.9 mev , with a width of 1.0 mev , via inelastic @xmath3-particle scattering in their @xmath1c(@xmath11 ) measurements .",
    "freer et al .",
    "@xcite see a @xmath4 state at 9.6 mev , with a width of 0.6 mev , in their inelastic proton scattering @xmath1c(p , p@xmath12 ) work .",
    "gai @xcite confirms the existence of a @xmath4 state around 10 mev ( but without being able to measure a width ) in photonuclear disintegration @xmath1c(@xmath13 ) studies .    in view of this resurgent interest in an excited hoyle band",
    "we ask in this paper to what extent the known data can be accounted for ( and further excited states predicted ) by a local potential @xmath2be+@xmath3 cluster model .",
    "this model provides a physically transparent and calculationally straightforward description of the energies , widths and charge radii of the known states in the proposed hoyle band .",
    "it also throws some light on the question of how high in angular momentum such a band might continue . in this way it can be a useful guide to experimental groups searching for as yet unidentified higher @xmath14 states .",
    "it is also illuminating to see how far one can get with a simple but physically motivated model .",
    "although ideally the full rigours of a more microscopic and computationally intensive approach might seem preferable , a rather simplified effective nucleon - nucleon potential is needed to carry this to fruition .",
    "it might be that a phenomenological approach can produce a band of states with properties closer to the experimental values . in any event",
    "it is interesting to compare the results from different theoretical treatments with each other as well as with experiment .    in the next section",
    "we describe our local potential @xmath2be+@xmath3 cluster model .",
    "after that , we compare the model s results with the available data and discuss the possible existence of additional states .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the cluster model employed here was first proposed to study the excited 4p-4h band of @xmath15o ( bandhead at 6.05 mev ) and the ground state band of @xmath16ne @xcite and has subsequently been applied to a wide range of nuclei across the periodic table from @xmath17li to @xmath18 cm .",
    "however , it has not previously been used for @xmath1c , because the ground state band of that nucleus is known to be oblate ( from the sign of its quadrupole moment @xcite ) and a two - body cluster - core system inevitably produces a prolate deformation .",
    "this is because , for spinless constituents like @xmath2be and @xmath3 , the quadrupole operator for the system reduces to @xmath19 the expectation value of this operator always yields a positive quadrupole moment , indicating a prolate spheroidal shape . to obtain negative quadrupole moments , appropriate to oblate shapes",
    ", it is necessary to consider three - body systems .",
    "this outcome provides a large part of the motivation behind attempts to model the ground state band of @xmath1c ( and indeed the excited @xmath20 state at 9.64 mev ) as an equilateral triangular arrangement of three @xmath3 particles @xcite .",
    "however , the indications that the hoyle state , and any associated rotations of it , have a large @xmath2be@xmath9 component , mark out the hoyle band as ideal territory for our local potential two - body cluster model .",
    "unfortunately , this does mean that we are unable to address any states of the @xmath1c system that do not have this particular structure .",
    "in particular , we can not model the ground state band and the excited @xmath20 state mentioned above .",
    "in general , we model a nucleus as two even - even sub - nuclei of mass @xmath21 and @xmath22 separated by a distance @xmath23 , interacting through a deep , local nuclear potential @xmath24 and a coulomb potential @xmath25 appropriate to a point cluster and a uniformly charged spherical core .",
    "the nuclear part has previously been parametrised in the form @xcite : @xmath26 }   \\nonumber \\\\\\ & + & { 1-x \\over [ 1+\\exp{((r - r_0)/3a ) } ] ^3 } \\biggr \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with parameter values given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 related to @xmath29 by @xmath30 } + { 1-x \\over        [ 1+\\exp{(-r_0/3a ) } ] ^3 } } } .\\ ] ] the radius parameter @xmath31 of the potential is determined by fitting to the experimental energy of the spectrum s band head , and is linked to the choice of @xmath5 ( see below ) .",
    "this potential is now incorporated into the cluster - core relative motion hamiltonian @xmath32 , and the resulting schrdinger equation @xmath33 is solved numerically .",
    "we label the wave functions and energies with the global quantum number @xmath5 , where @xmath34 is the number of internal nodes in the radial wave function and @xmath14 the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we must choose the value of @xmath35 large enough to guarantee that the pauli exclusion principle is satisfied by excluding the cluster constituents from states occupied by the core nucleons .",
    "for the @xmath2be + @xmath3 system this requires @xmath36 .",
    "the appropriate choice of @xmath35 is not clear cut when we are not using an oscillator potential , although we can certainly use oscillator considerations as a guide .",
    "the lowest allowed value , @xmath37 , would correspond to packing the @xmath3 nucleons into the p - shell , which seems an unlikely description of an excited state in @xmath1c .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness , we present calculations employing @xmath38 and 8 , with a view to deciding _ a posteriori _ on the basis of a comparison with experimental data which is the best choice .",
    "indeed , only _ a posteriori _ can we say that our model , with any eventually preferred value of @xmath35 , is appropriate for describing the hoyle state and its associated band by comparing its predictions with the measured properties of those states .",
    "although numerical solution of the schrdinger equation without any restrictions on @xmath35 certainly does produce lower lying states , they are pauli forbidden and do not correspond to physical states of @xmath1c .",
    "thus , we have no @xmath1c bound states in our model and can not use it to describe the observed ground @xmath0 or excited @xmath4 ( 4.44 mev ) states of the nucleus .",
    "equally , we can not describe the @xmath20 ( 9.64 mev ) state of @xmath1c ( as explained earlier ) .",
    "it is possible to produce negative parity states in our model by solving the schrdinger equation with an odd value of @xmath35 , but the resulting energies are 1020 mev above the hoyle state , and not of immediate interest .",
    "similarly , we could obtain negative parity states of @xmath1c by using even @xmath35 values in conjunction with an excited negative parity state of the @xmath2be core .",
    "again , the resulting excitation energies in @xmath1c are too high to be of interest in the current study .    as a further model extension",
    "we could include excitations of the @xmath2be core into its @xmath4 and @xmath39 states .",
    "we do not do this here because it would involve the introduction of more adjustable parameters to describe the non - central interactions that accompany such excitations , and we are trying to keep the number of fitted quantities to a minimum .",
    "our previous experience of including core excitations in treatments of @xmath15o @xcite and @xmath40 mg @xcite leads us to expect that they would not have a major effect on our conclusions in the the @xmath2be@xmath41 case .",
    "solving the schrdinger equation produces excitation energies and their associated widths directly .",
    "the resulting wave functions can also be used to calculate mean square charge radii of the states from @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the @xmath2be + @xmath3 system . to apply this formula for charge radii we need to supplement the wave functions generated above with a description of the ground state of @xmath2be ( or at least , of its mean square charge radius ) .",
    "an excellent description of @xmath8 scattering phase shifts and @xmath2be has already been given within the local potential cluster model @xcite using a gaussian nuclear potential @xmath45 with @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 @xmath48 and a coulomb potential @xmath49 with @xmath50 and where @xmath51 for the @xmath8 system .",
    "we adopt this description of @xmath2be wholesale because , within our model , it can hardly be improved upon .    as a consistency check on the widths of the states",
    "we can make use of our earlier work ( see for example @xcite ) on charged particle decay widths . within the two - body local potential model",
    ", a semiclassical approximation leads to an @xmath3-partial width of @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the two outermost classical turning points and @xmath55 is the reduced mass of the system .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath56 is given to good accuracy by @xmath57 with @xmath58 the innermost turning point , and the wave number @xmath59 is @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the experimental energy of the decaying state relative to the two - body breakup threshold .",
    "as outlined in the previous section , we calculate @xmath2be + @xmath3 cluster states , using a previously published prescription for the potential @xcite , without adjusting any of the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 listed in eq.(3 ) .",
    "we identify the @xmath0 state with the hoyle state , check that this choice produces a good account of the available data , and proceed to calculate similar states of higher angular momenta .",
    "each band of states is labelled by the choice of @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum possible value of @xmath14 in this scheme is equal to @xmath35 itself ( corresponding to the nodeless wave function ) .",
    "we determine the potential radius @xmath31 of the potential by fitting so as to reproduce the experimental energy of the @xmath0 hoyle state exactly .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath31 are listed in table i. it is also useful to know the position and maximum height of the potential ( coulomb barrier ) since this gives an upper limit on the energy of a resonant state with the corresponding value of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we also list these values in table i for the three values of @xmath38 and 8 under consideration .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] potential maxima for @xmath38 and 8 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure 2 shows the energy dependence of @xmath64 and im(@xmath65 ) for the @xmath66 resonance near the c.m .",
    "energy of about 2.22 mev .",
    "this is both a typical case , and the state that we are most interested in ( because of recent experimental results @xcite which have at last found a rotational state of the hoyle band ) .",
    "the best description of this state within our model is achieved using @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath37 there is no resonant state at all , and for @xmath67 the excitation energy is too low and the width too narrow .",
    "we are not unduly concerned that this value of @xmath35 does not tally  nicely \" with oscillator shell model considerations , which might suggest g=@xmath68 since most of the low - lying intruder states in this region are described as 4p-4h excitations in the shell model .",
    "we are not using a harmonic oscillator potential and will generate rather different wave functions with exponential rather than gaussian tails , and so do not expect an identity of @xmath35 values between the two cases .",
    "our calculations also predict an excited @xmath39 state at 13.71 mev .",
    "we predict a width of 1.24 mev for it , which would make it hard to detect in experiments .",
    "we note however that this excitation energy places the state above the barrier maximum for an @xmath69 state in a @xmath6 band , indicating that the result is not completely reliable , although still indicative of a possible @xmath39 state in this region .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that freer et al.@xcite have recently found evidence for a new state in @xmath1c at @xmath70 mev with a width of @xmath71 mev in their studies of the @xmath1c(@xmath72he , @xmath72he+@xmath72he+@xmath72he ) @xmath72he and @xmath73be(@xmath72he , @xmath72he+@xmath72he+@xmath72he)n reactions .",
    "analysis of the angular distributions suggests that the state might have j@xmath74 .",
    "as such , its properties are in line with our expectations for the third state in the hoyle band , and we await the outcome of further investigations with interest .",
    "previous analyses of inelastic electron scattering from @xmath1c @xcite indicate that the hoyle state has an abnormally large charge radius .",
    "we therefore calculate the values of @xmath75 implied by our model for @xmath38 and 8 .",
    "we first need to calculate a mean square charge radius for @xmath2be .",
    "we do this by using the mean square charge radius for an @xmath3-particle of 1.6757 fm @xcite and the mean square separation of the two @xmath3-particles calculated by our bound state code and confirmed by gamow using the potential of ref.@xcite in the formula @xmath76 this yields a mean square charge radius for @xmath2be of 10.634 @xmath77 ( with a square root of 3.261 fm ) .",
    "this , in turn , serves as input for the mean square charge radius of the hoyle state in the formula @xmath78 our @xmath6 value of 3.78 fm is somewhat below the value of 3.87 fm deduced by funaki et al .",
    "@xcite but significantly larger than the values deduced from earlier gcm calculations of 3.50 fm @xcite and 3.47 fm @xcite obtained from full 3@xmath3 calculations using volkov effective two - nucleon forces .",
    "it has long been suspected that the hoyle state in @xmath1c might have rotational excitations built upon it so that a hoyle band could be present in the @xmath1c spectrum .",
    "recent experimental work has located a @xmath4 state a little below 10 mev with a width of about 600 kev which is a strong candidate for such a structure . this has motivated us to apply a local potential @xmath2be-@xmath3 cluster model , with previously published potential prescription , to the system to see if we can reproduce the existing data and predict properties of other similar states .",
    "the calculation is numerically delicate but obtaining closely similar excitation energies from three different methods give us a good degree of confidence in our results .",
    "we find that with a global quantum number of @xmath6 we are able to give a good account of the width and root mean square charge radius of the hoyle state itself and a reasonable description of the excitation energy and width of the proposed excited @xmath4 member of the putative hoyle band .",
    "we note that our calculated @xmath4 state is very close to the top of the coulomb barrier .",
    "we also predict a rather wide @xmath39 state of the @xmath6 band at an excitation energy of roughly 14 mev , and find that the band certainly terminates here ( if not already with the @xmath4 state ) .",
    "however , our calculation is not completely reliable for this state , and there may be a case to be made that the known @xmath39 state at 14.083 mev @xcite should be assigned to the hoyle band .",
    "perhaps there are even two @xmath39 states there .",
    "this is an interesting conundrum which further experimental investigation might be able to resolve ."
