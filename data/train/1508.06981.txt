    "matter - wave interferometers accomplish an outstanding sensitivity for high precision measurements .",
    "this has been shown in various fields , e.g.  by the measurement of inertial forces @xcite , the gravitational acceleration @xcite and atomic or molecular polarizabilities @xcite . as a consequence of the high sensitivity , interferometers are also susceptible to external perturbations and noise that dephase the matter - wave .",
    "typical dephasing sources are temperature drifts , mechanical vibrations or electromagnetic oscillations .",
    "these influences result in a",
    " washing - out  of the interference fringes .",
    "it generally reduces the interference contrast @xcite and is especially an obstacle in precision phase measurements such as in aharonov - bohm physics @xcite .",
    "dephasing also needs to be prevented in decoherence studies where the transition from quantum to classical behaviour is analyzed through the contrast loss in matter - wave interferometers @xcite .",
    "decoherence destroys the phase relation between two beam paths by interaction with the environment , whereas dephasing is due to a collective time - dependent phase shift of the wave functions .",
    "both reduce the contrast and need to be distinguished to study experimentally the theory of decoherence @xcite .",

    "however , in a perturbingly environment this often can not be achieved efficiently in a broad frequency range .",
    "in addition , for some applications such as mobile interferometric devices @xcite , the perturbation sources and therefore the shielding requirements are changing between different experimental runs .    in this article",
    "we present a general method to reveal dephasing and reduce the influence of external multi - frequency perturbations and noise by second order correlation analysis of an interference pattern .",
    "the technique can in principle be applied in all matter - wave interferometers , where the detector has a high spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "such detectors are available for electrons @xcite , ions @xcite , neutrons @xcite and neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "perturbation frequencies below the mean particle count rate can then be revealed after data acquisition is completed .",
    "recently , we demonstrated @xcite that the influence of a single perturbation frequency can be isolated , removed and the complete spatial interference pattern be recovered .",
    "all parameters such as the contrast , pattern periodicity , perturbation frequency and amplitude can be extracted from the perturbed interference data .",
    "this is useful to eliminate a distinct electromagnetic oscillation such as noise from the electric network or a vibration from a rotating vacuum pump .    in this article",
    "we enhance this method towards several frequencies with different amplitudes , that dephase the interference pattern at once .",
    "we provide a detailed theoretical description of the multi - frequency case , for which we calculate an exact solution for the second order correlation function .",
    "while the theory holds for an arbitrary number of discrete perturbation frequencies , it requires increasing computational power .",
    "however , an approximate solution can be found , which is used to extend the theory to arbitrary noise spectra with a high - frequency cutoff .",
    "such noise is often found in typical lab situations , where several low frequency noise sources disturb the interference pattern at the same time . here , the relative phases of the frequency components do not influence the correlation function and the approximate solution is applicable .",
    "we demonstrate our method by the application of an electron matter - wave interferometer in combination with a delay - line detector . using an external magnetic field ,",
    "we introduce artificial multi - frequency noise , which we analyze on the basis of the `` washed - out '' interference pattern . in detail",
    ", we demonstrate two- and three - frequency perturbations , including the special case , where the frequencies are multiples of each other .",
    "the influence of broad - band noise is investigated by using a perturbation spectrum with a cutoff frequency of @xmath0{hz}$ ] . for all scenarios ,",
    "the measured particle correlations are compared to our theory .",
    "recently , we demonstrated a full correlation analysis for a single frequency perturbation of a matter - wave interference pattern in an interferometer @xcite . in the following we discuss the general case and extend the correlation analysis to multiple perturbation frequencies and broad - band noise .    similar as before , we start with the probability distribution @xmath1 of particle impacts at the detector @xmath2 here @xmath3 denotes the contrast , @xmath4 the wave number of the unperturbed interference pattern with spatial periodicity @xmath5 , and @xmath6 assures normalization .",

    "these perturbations will typically lead to a `` wash - out '' of the time - averaged interference pattern at the detector .    to regain information about the unperturbed interference pattern ,",
    "the spatial and temporal information of the particles arriving at the detector is recorded and evaluated by correlation analysis .",

    "<S> high contrast matter - wave interferometry is essential in various fundamental quantum mechanical experiments as well as for technical applications . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , contrast and sensitivity are typically reduced by decoherence and dephasing effects . while decoherence accounts for a general loss of quantum information in a system due to entanglement with the environment , dephasing is due to collective time - dependent external phase shifts , which can be related to temperature drifts , mechanical vibrations or electromagnetic oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to decoherence , dephasing can in principle be reversed . here , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate in experiment and theory a method for the analysis and reduction of the influence of dephasing noise and perturbations consisting of several external frequencies in an electron interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> this technique uses the high spatial and temporal resolution of a delay line detector to reveal and remove dephasing perturbations by second order correlation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it allows matter - wave experiments under perturbingly lab conditions and can be applied in principle to electron , atom , ion , neutron and molecule interferometers . </S>"
