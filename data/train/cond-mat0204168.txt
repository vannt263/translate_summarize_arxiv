    "disordered systems @xcite are usually characterized by a complicated energy ( or free energy ) landscape , with many local minima representing metastable states , separated by saddles and barriers which govern the dynamics . in general , obtaining analytical information on the statistics of large scale extrema and saddles of a random energy landscape @xmath0 is an extremely hard task . in one dimension however , the situation is simpler since one has to deal with an alternating sequence of minima and maxima , and there is hope for analytical progress .",
    "recently , the large scale extrema of the pure brownian landscape and of the biased brownian landscape have been studied with a powerful real space renormalization technique @xcite . there",
    "the interest was in the non - equilibrium arrhenius dynamics of a particle in such a landscape , the so - called sinai model @xcite . at large time",
    "this dynamics is dominated by jumps between deep minima .",
    "the renormalization procedure thus consists in erasing iteratively the small barriers in the landscape , and retaining only the large scale , large energy features which control the large time dynamics .",
    "this procedure yields the asymptotically exact large time dynamics in the case of the sinai model , and allows to obtain a host of exact results @xcite .",
    "this real space renormalization technique has also been used in other one dimensional models , such as quantum spin chains @xcite , reaction diffusion with disorder @xcite and the random field ising model @xcite , with the same fixed points associated to the pure or to the biased brownian landscape . for the coarsening of pure 1d @xmath1 model at zero temperature from a random initial condition @xcite ,",
    "another fixed point was found which corresponds to the successive elimination of smallest domains , the only variable there being the length .",
    "a question is then whether other energy landscapes can be studied using similar techniques .",
    "a one - dimensional energy landscape of interest is the so - called  toy model \" defined by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where the random potential @xmath3 is a brownian motion with correlations @xmath4 here we have defined the model directly in the continuum limit , but the universality class contains all models with a small scale cutoff and the above behavior ( [ corre ] ) at large scale . this model has been introduced by villain _",
    "_ as a zero - dimensional toy - model for an interface in the random field ising model @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review previous studies of this model and explain some motivations to reexamine this model .      for a single particle , the boltzmann equilibrium problem at temperature @xmath5",
    "is defined by the partition function @xmath6 .",
    "although it seems very simple at first sight , it is an interesting example of disordered system . because of the quadratic well , the typical position of the particle is finite , but it fluctuates in a non trivial way from sample to sample .",
    "an imry - ma argument gives the following scaling for the typical scale of the absolute minimum @xmath7 where we denote by the brackets @xmath8 the thermal boltzmann measure with potential ( [ deftoy ] ) and by an overbar the average over the random potential ( [ corre ] ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath9 will be computed here .",
    "usual methods such as perturbation expansion ( even summing all terms ) @xcite or iteration method @xcite completely fail to recover ( [ scaling1 ] ) .",
    "a larkin type perturbation @xcite with a small scale cutoff also predicts @xmath10 instead of ( [ scaling1 ] ) . within replica",
    "variational _ approximations _ of the present model ( or within the solvable mean field limit of large embedding space dimension @xmath11 , see below ) this is cured at the price of spontaneous replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) @xcite .",
    "rsb is of course not expected to occur in the present exact model ( [ deftoy ] - [ corre ] ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion of the cases where rsb may occur in a one dimensional model ) .",
    "the toy model also possesses the ` statistical tilt symmetry ' as other random field models @xcite or the directed polymer model @xcite , which imply exact remarquable identities @xcite between the disorder averages of the thermal cumulants of the position at any temperature , as a consequence from the statistical translation invariance of the random potential .",
    "these exact identities can be summarized by @xcite @xmath12 which is simply quadratic in @xmath13 , so that the second cumulant reads @xmath14 and the disorder - average of all thermal cumulants of order greater than two vanish ! as emphasized in @xcite , in the low temperature regime , the result ( [ second ] ) implies that the thermal fluctuations of the toy model are related to the presence of metastable states in rare disordered samples .",
    "an arrhenius dynamics can be defined for the toy model , and provided @xmath15 is small so that barriers can be large , one can ask about universal long time properties .",
    "this was studied for the special case @xmath16 where one recovers the sinai model @xcite .",
    "the dynamics for small but finite @xmath15 is interesting for several physical systems of the random field type , and has not been studied up to now , to our knowledge .",
    "physically , one expects the diffusion to interpolate between a sinai - type diffusion at short rescaled time and the approach of equilibrium at long rescaled time .",
    "the toy model has also attracted a lot of attention in connection with the problem of @xmath17-dimensional manifolds in @xmath18 random media , where it plays the role of a prototype model since it represents the simplest case @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it has been moreover argued in @xcite that the toy model actually describes the statistics of the end - point of a random polymer of length @xmath21 in @xmath22 with delta correlated noise in the limit @xmath21 large with the correspondence @xmath23 .",
    "it was found numerically in @xcite that the correlation of the effective random potential for the directed polymer model behaves as ( [ corre ] ) only at short distances but saturates at large distances .",
    "this analysis has been confirmed by a scaling argument in @xcite and was finally rigorously proven in @xcite where the full statistics of the effective potential was exactly computed to be an  airy process \" , defined there .",
    "thus the approximation of end - point of the directed polymer in @xmath22 by the toy model is valid only locally .",
    "the toy model is related to the statistical properties of a velocity field @xmath24 evolving according to the burgers equation @xcite @xmath25 this equation can be solved via the hopf - cole transformation as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a brownian motion in the case where the initial velocity field @xmath28 is a white noise process . in the inviscid limit @xmath29 ,",
    "the integrals are dominated by the saddle @xmath30 which gives @xmath31 the velocity distribution and the statistical properties of shocks ( which appear at the points @xmath32 where there are two degenerate minima in ( [ eqsaddle ] ) ) are thus directly related to the properties of minima of the toy model ( [ deftoy ] ) with the correspondence @xmath33 .",
    "the toy model is also related to the relaxation of an interface evolving according to the deterministic kpz equation @xcite @xmath34 from a random initial condition @xmath35 which is a white noise in @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , the mapping @xcite @xmath37 transforms the deterministic kpz equation ( [ kpz ] ) into the burgers equation ( [ burgers ] ) , leading to @xmath38 again in the limit @xmath29 where the saddle method yields ( [ vsaddle ] ) , the profile @xmath39 is made of parabolic segments joined together by cusps corresponding to the shocks of the burgers equation ( see for instance fig.1 in @xcite ) .      for definiteness , we will consider in the following an ising spin chain , but one can study not only spin systems , but also for instance liquid helium meniscus on a rough substrate @xcite , which does also see random field disorder , and can in principle be probed in confined , quasi one dimensional geometry .",
    "let us consider as in @xcite the 1d random field ising system of hamiltonian @xmath40 with spins @xmath41 , and study its equilibrium and its low temperature glauber dynamics .",
    "in the domain wall representation , two types of domains walls @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , in numbers @xmath46 and @xmath47 , alternate at positions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , respectively , and the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath50 with @xmath51 . the potential felt by domains walls of type b is @xmath52 while domain walls @xmath42 feel potential @xmath53 .",
    "the dynamics proceeds by diffusion and annihilation of domains of opposite types .    in @xcite , the zero field @xmath54 and the uniform applied field @xmath55 situations have been studied .",
    "the toy model corresponds to the other interesting case @xmath56 representing _ a field gradient _ with zero net applied field ( such gradients are easy to produce experimentally ) .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that defining the scaled length @xmath57 , each domain wall @xmath44 sees the toy model energy landscape @xmath58 with @xmath59 defined in ( [ deftoy ] ) in terms of a unit brownian and @xmath60 for a positive field gradient ( @xmath61 ) , the domain walls of type @xmath44 @xmath45 will be attracted towards the minima of @xmath59 , and will thus be confined in the neighborhood of the point @xmath62 where the applied field vanishes , whereas the domain walls of type @xmath42 @xmath43 will be attracted by the local maxima of @xmath59 or will be expelled towards the boundaries .    the equilibrium of the toy model considered above and its dynamics involving only one particle corresponds to a _",
    "domain wall @xmath44 . if the field gradient is @xmath61 and if the system is initially prepared with the  natural \" boundary conditions , namely spin far on the left are @xmath63 , far on the right @xmath64 and with a _ single",
    "_ domain wall of type @xmath44 in between , it remains such , until equilibration time @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 if domains can be created at boundaries )",
    ". during that window of time the domain wall diffuses in the toy model landscape and reaches thermal equilibrium at time @xmath67 , a time scale which can be much smaller than @xmath68 if @xmath69 is sufficiently large .",
    "another interesting situation corresponds to _ unstable _ single domain wall dynamics and is obtained if the field gradient is applied against these boundary conditions , e.g. a single @xmath42 domain initially .",
    "the domain is then expelled towards either side after a time @xmath70 which again can be well before @xmath68 if @xmath69 is sufficiently large .",
    "finally , the full , many domain coarsening can be studied and is expected to exhibit a large degree of universality in the small @xmath71 , large imry ma length @xmath72 , small temperature @xmath73 , large time limit as in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study because of the competition between the disorder which tends to slow the coarsening and the field gradient which tend to accelerate the process .",
    "to summarize , the toy model ( [ deftoy ] ) is thus interesting from several points of view . for the statics , it is directly related to more complex problems ( directed polymer , burgers turbulence and kpz equation ) in some particular limits , as described above ; on the other hand , it represents in itself a ` toy ' disordered system that presents many properties of more complex models , such as the presence of metastable states and the identities of the statistical tilt symmetry .    up to now",
    ", the landscape @xmath0 of the toy model has been characterized by two kinds of approach .",
    "there has been on one side some studies on the absolute minimum of the toy model , either in probability theory @xcite and in the context of the burgers equation @xcite , and on the other side a study @xcite on the statistics of all extrema of the model ( [ deftoy ] ) , but that does not distinguish between the important ones ( the deep ones ) and the large number of unimportant small scale extrema , nor does it yield any information on joint distributions .",
    "none of these studies addresses the question of the joint distributions in energy and position of the set of all deep extrema , neither the one relevant for the statics ( several minima ) and even less the one relevant for the dynamics ( maxima , minima and barriers ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that the renormalization method can be generalized to solve a broader class of one dimensional landscape than the previously solved brownian landscape @xcite and that it is of deeper fundamental interest as an alternative to more conventional probability theory techniques .",
    "the class explicitly solved here includes the toy model ( [ deftoy ] ) landscape .",
    "we formulate the rsrg for a general one - dimensional landscape as an exact method to obtain the joint probability distribution , in total number , position and value of energy on the subset of the important deep extrema .",
    "more precisely , the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath74 is defined by the subset of extrema of the initial landscape which have survived after the erasing of all barriers smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "this is equivalent to require that in a segment between a maximum @xmath75 and the next minimum @xmath76 of the renormalized landscape , any two points @xmath77 with @xmath78 must satisfy the constraint that the energy difference @xmath79 is smaller than @xmath74 ( and the symmetrical condition for a segment between a minimum and the next maximum ) .",
    "the joint probability distribution of this subset of important extrema contains a tremendous amount of information , including in particular the distribution of absolute extrema , of secondary extrema , of largest barriers etc ... of course the general case is intractable analytically , but our aim is to identify solvable models and universality classes , given by some continuum limits .    to be more specific , we will consider the continuum models where the potential @xmath0 is a stochastic process defined by the langevin equation @xmath80 + \\eta(x ) \\label{langevin } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath81 being a delta correlated white noise .",
    "the toy model ( [ deftoy ] ) corresponds to the case where the force does nt depend on @xmath0 and is linear in @xmath32 @xmath82 = f[x ] = \\mu x   \\label{forcetoy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another cases of interest are the stationary landscapes , where the force in the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) is independent of the space @xmath32 @xmath83 = f[u ] = - \\frac{d w[u]}{d u } \\label{defstatio}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the case @xmath84=0 $ ] is the pure brownian landscape , and the case @xmath84=f>0 $ ] is the biased brownian landscape .",
    "these are the only two cases where the rsrg has been applied up to now @xcite , but we will show here that it generalizes to include any @xmath84 $ ] . note that solving the landscape problem here also amounts to solve the problem of the joint distribution of extremal points in the trajectory of a particle in a one dimensional force field @xmath85 where @xmath32 is interpreted as `` time '' and @xmath86 as the position of the particle .",
    "for all cases ( [ langevin ] ) , the markovian character of the langevin equation implies that the landscape measure can be written as product of blocks measures which satisfy closed real space renormalization equations . for the specific cases of the toy model ( [ forcetoy ] ) and of stationary landscapes ( [ defstatio ] ) , we obtain here explicit expressions for the blocks measures .",
    "this is achieved by two complementary methods very different in spirit .",
    "on one hand , for the above continuum models we are able to directly compute the blocks using some constrained path integrals . on the other hand , we can also start from the rsrg equations for the blocks and assume some ansatz which solves these equations and obtain , interestingly via the liouville equation , analytical forms for the blocks . as is customary in searching for rg fixed points ,",
    "this can be done without specifying the initial landscape , and as a result the solutions look a priori more general .",
    "we show that these do contain the universality classes corresponding to ( [ langevin ] ) , with a result which coincide exactly with one obtained by the direct path integral method .",
    "our study thus makes more precise the interesting relations between the powerful rsrg method and more conventional probabilistic approach using stochastic calculus .    for the case of the toy model , the full solution for the joint probability measure of the renormalized landscape is obtained in this way explicitly in terms of airy functions .",
    "we then use this exact measure of the renormalized landscape to study in details the equilibrium and the non - equilibrium dynamics of the toy model ( [ deftoy ] ) and give some results for the rfim in a field gradient .    for the equilibrium",
    ", we study the statistical properties of the absolute minimum which dominates at zero temperature . we obtain simple exact expressions for the moments of the position of a single particle at equilibrium and and compare with the results of approximate methods , namely the gaussian variational replica study @xcite and of the vector breaking of replica symmetry @xcite .",
    "we also compute the properties of configurations with nearly degenerate minima which govern the thermal fluctuations at very low - temperature , and we prove that the rare configurations presenting two nearly degenerate minima do not only give a finite contribution to ( [ second ] ) , but actually are entirely responsible of the full result ( [ second ] ) .    for the dynamics of a single particle in the toy energy landscape ( e.g. a single rfim domain wall ) , we compute the distribution over samples of the equilibration time @xmath67 or equivalently the distribution of the largest barrier @xmath87 in the system .",
    "our results are expressed in terms of the dimensionless scaling parameter @xmath88 and we give in particular the two asymptotic behaviors of the distribution for @xmath89 small and large .",
    "we characterize the rare configurations presenting an anomalously large equilibration time which govern the long - time dynamics .",
    "we also compute local properties of the renormalized landscape , such as the probability density of a minimum at scale @xmath90 , and the the disorder averaged diffusion front for a single particle , which interpolates between the kesten distribution of the sinai model at short rescaled time and the reaching of equilibrium at long rescaled time .",
    "these quantities can be translated into results for observables of the rfim in a field gradient , assuming convergence to the full state where each maximum of the renormalized landscape contains an a domain and each minimum a b domain .",
    "this convergence was proved in @xcite and also holds here in range of parameters of interest ( small @xmath15 , large time @xmath91 ) and with a random initial condition . as time",
    "@xmath92 increases , decimations occur corresponding to pairs of @xmath93 domains annihilating . thus initially , many domain coarsening",
    "take place .",
    "depending on the scaling parameter : @xmath94 the equilibrium state , reached at time @xmath95 will contain either a single domain wall @xmath44 ( for @xmath96 ) or several additional pairs @xmath93 ( infinitely many as @xmath97 ) .",
    "the behaviors of the sample to sample probabilities that a single domain wall @xmath44 remains is obtained . a formal solution for the total magnetization",
    "is easily written , and an explicit calculation is performed for large @xmath98 where a single domain wall remains . indeed in that limit",
    "the total magnetization is simply @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the absolute minimum of the toy landscape .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section [ generalrg ] is devoted to the general definitions and properties of the renormalization procedure for an arbitrary one - dimensional landscape . in section [ explicitsolu ]",
    ", we compute the probability measure of the renormalized landscape for a large class of models .",
    "we then study in details the toy model : we construct the probability measure for the renormalized landscape in section [ landscapetoy ] , we study its equilibrium properties in section [ equilibriumtoy ] , and the non - equilibrium dynamics in section [ dynamicstoy ] .",
    "some results for the rfim in a field gradient are also discussed in section [ dynamicstoy ] .",
    "the section [ statiolandscape ] contains our results for the case of stationary landscapes .",
    "finally , to facilitate reading of the paper , we give the more detailed definitions and derivations in the several appendices .",
    "this section contains the precise definitions of the measure for the initial landscape and for the renormalized landscape .",
    "the probability measure of the renormalized landscape satisfies by construction a set of rg equations for the joint distribution of extrema .",
    "the general model studied in this paper is the following .",
    "we consider one dimensional random landscapes @xmath0 which for definiteness in this section are continuous in the energy @xmath86 , discrete in space @xmath32 and defined on a finite interval @xmath101 .",
    "a realization of the random landscape is thus simply given by a set of random variables @xmath102 , @xmath101 and the original problem is defined by some probability measure noted    @xmath103 du \\equiv { \\cal p}(u_1, ... u_n ) ~~ du_1 ...",
    "du_n \\label{initialmeasure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the normalization with the fixed boundary conditions @xmath104 and @xmath105 reads @xmath106 we are interested in the statistics of the extrema of this landscape . for definiteness , we choose here the convention that there are infinite potential outside the interval , i.e. @xmath107 , and that @xmath108 is odd .",
    "we then define the probability @xmath109 that the initial landscape has @xmath110 local minima situated at positions @xmath111 with the potentials @xmath112 and @xmath113 local maxima situated at positions",
    "@xmath114 with potentials @xmath115 .",
    "they are of course alternated @xmath116 and the values @xmath117 and @xmath118 are allowed .",
    "an explicit and more precise definition of these objects is given in appendix [ calculsn2 ] , with a derivation of their normalization property @xmath119 the objects @xmath120 are usually extremely complicated and contain a lot of irrelevant information .",
    "to single out the important , deep extrema we now define the renormalized landscape where all small barriers have been eliminated .",
    "the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath74 is defined by the list of positions and energies of a _ subset _",
    "@xmath121 of extrema of the initial landscape . for @xmath122",
    ", @xmath123 is the set of all extrema of the initial landscape .",
    "for @xmath124 it is the subset of extrema that survive when all barriers smaller than @xmath74 in the system have been erased .",
    "this is shown in fig 1 .",
    "this subset @xmath121 is again made of alternating minima and maxima .",
    "it is convenient to call descending bonds the segments between a maximum and the next minimum both in @xmath121 ( and respectively ascending bonds the segments between a minimum and the next maximum ) .",
    "the constraint obeyed by the subset is that any two points @xmath125 on a bond @xmath126 $ ] with @xmath127 must satisfy that their energy difference @xmath128 is smaller than @xmath74 if the bond is descending , and symmetrically , the energy difference @xmath129 must be smaller than @xmath74 if the bond is ascending .",
    "the main object of interest is the probability measure of the renormalized landscape .",
    "we consider the probability @xmath130 that the renormalized landscape has @xmath110 local minima situated at positions @xmath111 with the potentials @xmath112 and @xmath113 local maxima situated at positions @xmath114 with potentials @xmath115 .",
    "again , more precise and explicit definitions are given in appendix [ calculsn2 ] , with a derivation of the normalization @xmath131 the normalization of the measure for the renormalized landscape thus coincides with the normalization of the measure for the initial landscape ( [ normameasure],[normainitiale ] ) .",
    "the @xmath132 satisfy the rg equation ( see appendix [ calculsn2 ] ) @xmath133 where , for convenience and future applications to continuum limits , we have used the integral symbol instead of the sum , i.e. @xmath134 instead of @xmath135 .",
    "these rsrg equation describe the decimation upon increasing @xmath74 and are thus a generalization to an arbitrary landscape of the standard rsrg equations considered in the case of a brownian landscape ( see the formulae ( 197 ) and the figure 8 in ref @xcite ) .",
    "it simply expresses that as @xmath74 is increased , pairs of extrema separated by an energy barrier @xmath74 are eliminated .",
    "each term in ( [ rsrg ] ) corresponds to possible positions of this pair , as represented in fig [ fig2 ] , the first and last one corresponding to edge bonds .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find solvable cases where analytical solutions of ( [ rsrg ] ) are possible .",
    "the general case with arbitrary correlations in the original landscape can only be studied by numerical implementations of the decimation procedure .",
    "this has been done , for instance , in the case of a logarithmically correlated landscape in @xcite . however , for the initial landscapes that are defined by an initial local measure , we expect that the measure for the renormalized landscape can be decomposed as a product of blocks associated to bonds as we now describe .      from now on",

    "to be more specific we now consider the continuum models of markovian landscapes where the potential @xmath0 is a stochastic process defined by the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) .",

    "<S> the real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) method introduced previously for the brownian landscape is generalized to obtain the joint probability distribution of the subset of the important extrema at large scales of other one - dimensional landscapes . for a large class of models we give exact solutions obtained either by the use of constrained path - integrals in the continuum limit , or by solving the rsrg equations via an ansatz which leads to the liouville equation . </S>",
    "<S> we apply in particular our results to the toy model energy landscape , which consists in a quadratic potential plus a brownian potential , which describes , among others , the energy of a single domain wall in a 1d random field ising model ( rfim ) in the presence of a field gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the measure of the renormalized landscape is obtained explicitly in terms of airy functions , and allows to study in details the boltzmann equilibrium of a particle at low temperature as well as its non - equilibrium dynamics . for the equilibrium , we give results for the statistics of the absolute minimum which dominates at zero temperature , and for the configurations with nearly degenerate minima which govern the thermal fluctuations at very low - temperature . for the dynamics , we compute the distribution over samples of the equilibration time , or equivalently the distribution of the largest barrier in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the properties of the rare configurations presenting an anomalously large equilibration time which govern the long - time dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the disorder averaged diffusion front , which interpolates between the kesten distribution of the sinai model at short rescaled time and the reaching of equilibrium at long rescaled time . </S>",
