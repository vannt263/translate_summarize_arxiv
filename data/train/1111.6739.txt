    "in twenty - first century , energy efficient and environmentally friendly technology has received special attention in order to combat the global warming phenomenon and energy crisis .",
    "refrigeration based on the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) has attracted much research interest because of its higher energy efficiency over the conventional vapor compression refrigeration and it does not use ozone - depleting chlorofluorocarbon as a refrigerant @xcite .",
    "magnetocaloric effect describes the reversible change in temperature of a material under adiabatic condition produced by the magnetic entropy change @xmath12@xmath13 due to the variation in applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the main aim in this field is to search for new materials , which exhibit a large mce and are capable of operating at different temperature ranges , depending on the intended applications .",
    "large mce close to room temperature would be useful for domestic and several technological applications while large mce in the low - temperature region is important for specific technological applications such as space science and liquefaction of hydrogen in fuel industry @xcite .",
    "the guidelines for the choice of an appropriate material are that it should have low heat capacity and exhibit a large entropy change at the ferromagnetic ( fm ) to paramagnetic ( pm ) transition or field - induced metamagnetic transition from antiferromagnetic ( afm ) to fm states with a minimal hysteresis .    in colossal magnetoresistive oxides",
    ", mce has been extensively studied due to their wide variation in the curie temperature ( @xmath14 ) and nature of fm - pm phase transition @xcite .",

    "so far , most of the studies on these systems are concentrated on the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of mn sublattice because their interplay has opened up a new dimension in basic research as well as technological application .",
    "the magnetic structure determination is a prerequisite for understanding the coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism in these materials .",
    "several neutron and resonance x - ray studies reveal that @xmath0mno@xmath1 undergo sequence of complicated magnetic phase transitions with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown the rare - earth magnetic ordering plays a very important role in the magnetoelectric coupling @xcite . according to the crystallographic structure , these multiferroic materials are divided into two classes .",

    "however , in hexagonal compounds , the magnetic frustration of mn spin arises from the lattice geometry since the triangular lattice is frustrated for afm first - nearest - neighbor interaction and the ferroelectric order occurs at an elevated temperature ( @xmath15900 k ) which is well above the magnetic ordering temperature ( @xmath1580 k ) @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of mn sublattice , the afm ordering of rare - earth moments in multiferroic @xmath0mno@xmath16 occurs at a relatively low temperature ( @xmath4@xmath178 k ) and the magnetic structure is highly anisotropic with very weak interaction along one of the crystallographic axes . as a result , several multiferroic manganites with high total angular momentum quantum number of rare - earth ion exhibit huge increase in magnetization at a moderate field strength ( @xmath152 t ) which is close to the expected moment of @xmath5 ion . in this work ,",

    "apart from the values , there are several important differences in the nature of @xmath6 dependence of @xmath9 for two crystallographic axes . with the increase of magnetic field , the maximum in @xmath9(@xmath7 ) shifts to higher temperature for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath23 while the position of the maximum remains pinned at @xmath155 k for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath27 . for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath9 is negative down to 2 k even at very low fields , i.e. , inverse mce is absent in the afm state .",
    "however , for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath27 , @xmath9 is positive well below @xmath86 at low fields ( @xmath6@xmath17@xmath3 ) . unlike dymno@xmath1 ,",
    "inverse mce in homno@xmath1 is very small .",
    "one can see that @xmath12s@xmath87 is large for a moderate field change along easy axis .",
    "the values of other magnetocaloric parameters such as rcp and @xmath47 are also large for homno@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "we observe rcp@xmath2144 j mol@xmath32 and @xmath47@xmath212.5 k for the field change of 8 t along easy axis .     for a field change from 0 - 1 to 0 - 8",

    "figure 8 shows the field dependence of magnetization for ybmno@xmath1 at different temperatures .",
    "one can see that the nature of magnetic response of the crystal with field along @xmath31 and @xmath10 axes are very different .",
    "unlike homno@xmath1 , @xmath8 is slightly larger along the @xmath10 axis as compared to basal plane and two field - induced transitions are clearly visible .",
    "however , @xmath8 along @xmath31 axis increases smoothly with @xmath6 similar to that in homno@xmath1 crystal .",
    "the transition at high - field ( @xmath153 t ) is extremely sharp ( step - like ) below @xmath88 ( @xmath23.6 k ) , shifts progressively towards higher field with increasing @xmath7 and clearly visible up to 14 k [ fig .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath8 does not show saturation - like behavior up to 8 t and the value @xmath8 at 2 k and 8 t for both the axes are comparable and about 37 - 39@xmath68 of the expected moment . this behavior is quite different from other multiferroic manganites where @xmath8 along two axes are significantly different and the observed high - field value of @xmath8 for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath23 is close to expected moment .",
    "this suggests that ybmno@xmath1 is magnetically less anisotropic and the afm interaction along both the axes is strong . indeed from the magnetization measurements in the paramagnetic state ,",
    "we observe that @xmath54 is large and negative along both the crystallographic axes and their values are 195 and 225 k within the basal plane and along @xmath10 axis , respectively . in order to determine the order of field - induced magnetic transition ,",
    "we have also done the arrott plots of magnetization data of ybmno@xmath1 [ fig .",
    "the nature of the arrott plots for @xmath6 along @xmath31 axis is qualitatively similar to those for homno@xmath1 crystal but for @xmath6 along @xmath10 axis the low - field peak is quite prominent and the change in slope from positive to negative is abrupt , marked by a much sharper triangular - shaped minimum at @xmath3 .",
    "however , unlike homno@xmath1 , the linear extrapolation of high - field magnetization data to @xmath6@xmath20 reveals a non - zero positive value of @xmath8 up to 2@xmath88 for @xmath6 along @xmath10 axis .",
    "figure 10 illustrates the temperature dependence of @xmath9 in a magnetic field change up to 8 t. @xmath9 reaches a negative maximum value @xmath152.3",
    "k@xmath32 for @xmath12h@xmath28 t. though the magnitude of @xmath9 is smaller for ybmno@xmath1 due to the smaller total angular momentum quantum number , the overall nature of @xmath7 and @xmath6 dependence of @xmath9 is similar to homno@xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the value of @xmath47 is significantly large ( @xmath1515 k ) in spite of its smaller @xmath9 and rcp ( 26 j mol@xmath32 ) . in order to compare and contrast the nature of mce among multiferroic manganites , the variation of @xmath12s@xmath87 , @xmath12t@xmath89 and rcp for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath23",
    "have been plotted in fig .",
    "11 which shows that these parameters increase monotonically with @xmath12h .",
    "though the values of @xmath12s@xmath87 , @xmath12t@xmath89 and rcp depend on the system , the nature of their field dependence is qualitatively similar .",
    "it is clear from the figures that among the four systems we have studied , dymno@xmath1 , tbmno@xmath1 and homno@xmath1 are most suitable as low temperature refrigerant due to the high values of magnetocaloric parameters at a moderate field change .",
    "in conclusion , the detailed analysis of magnetization data shows that the magnetic interaction within the rare - earth sublattice in multiferroics @xmath0mno@xmath1 is highly anisotropic ( except @xmath0@xmath2yb ) . above a critical field @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath0mno@xmath1 undergo a field - induced first - order metamagnetic transition from afm to fm state and a second - order pm - fm transition along with huge magnetic entropy change . depending on @xmath7 and the direction of applied field",
    ", @xmath9 can be negative or positive , i.e. , @xmath0mno@xmath1 exhibit both normal and inverse mce .",
    "except at low temperatures well below @xmath4 , @xmath9 is negative and large in the field - induced fm state . for orthorhombic dymno@xmath1 and tbmno@xmath1",
    ", the inverse mce is small , decreases with @xmath6 and eventually crosses over to normal one above @xmath3 for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath23 while it is large and increases with @xmath6 for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath27 . in contrary to this , hexagonal homno@xmath1 and ybmno@xmath1 may show small inverse mce only below @xmath3 and at very low temperature for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath10 .",
    "both orthorhombic and hexagonal multiferroics , except ybmno@xmath1 , exhibit giant mce , and large adiabatic temperature change and relative cooling power for @xmath6@xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "the large values of these parameters , negligible hysteresis and highly insulating nature suggest that the multiferroic manganites could be potential materials for magnetic refrigeration in the low - temperature region .",
    "the present results also show that orthorhombic and hexagonal multiferroic manganites can be differentiated based on the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of rare - earth sublattice .",
