    "exist a solid  phase where the vortex lines form a triangular abrikosov lattice @xcite . in the presence of impurities",
    "it was suggested @xcite the abrikosov crystal is replaced by a dislocation -free bragg glass which is also characterized by ( quasi- ) long range order .",
    "this solid can melt due to thermal fluctuations or changes in the magnetic field .",
    "in particular known observed transitions are into a flux liquid at higher temperatures via a first - order _ melting line _ ( ml)@xcite , and into a vortex glass at low temperature @xcite,@xcite , in the presence of disorder- the so called _ entanglement line _ ( el ) .",
    "@xcite    recently the effect of point and columnar disorder on the position of the melting transition has been measured experimentally in the high-@xmath0 material @xmath1 @xcite(bscco ) .",
    "point disorder has been induced by electron irradiation ( with 2.5 mev electrons ) , whereas columnar disorder has been induced by heavy ion irradiation ( 1 gev xe or 0.9 gev pb ) .",
    "it turns out that the flux melting transition persists in the presence of either type of disorder , but its position shifts depending on the disorder type and strength .",
    "a significant difference has been observed between the effects of columnar and point disorder on the location of the ml .",
    "weak columnar defects stabilize the solid phase with respect to the vortex liquid phase and shift the transition to _ higher _ fields , whereas point - like disorder destabilizes the vortex lattice and shifts the melting transition to _ lower _ fields . in this paper",
    "we attempt to provide a quantitative explanation to this observation .",
    "the case of point defects has been addressed in a recent paper by ertas and nelson @xcite using the cage - model approach which replaces the effect of vortex - vortex interactions by an harmonic potential felt by a single vortex . for columnar disorder",
    "the parabolic cage model was introduced by nelson and vinokur @xcite .",

    "the vortex line represents the polymer which is directed along the z - axis ( overhangs are neglected ) .",
    "the presence of impurities enhances the transverse wandering of the polymer .    for the case of columnar ( or correlated ) disorder , @xmath17 is independent of @xmath2 , and @xmath18 in this case we map the problem of a fl in a superconductor into that of a quantum particle in a random potential",

    "this length arises by equating the elastic energy and the cage potential energy of the fl . typically after it wanders a distance @xmath26 along the z - direction the fl",
    "is reflected back by the walls of the cage and restarts its transverse excursions .",
    "the near saturation of @xmath27 at @xmath28 will become evident from the analytical expressions derived in the following sections .",
    "we thus define the mean square displacement of the flux line by    @xmath29    the location of the melting line is determined by the lindemann criterion @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the phenomenological lindemann constant .",
    "this means that when the transverse excursion of a section of length @xmath32becomes comparable to a finite fraction of the interline separation @xmath33 , the melting of the flux solid occurs .",
    "we start with the case of point disorder that is simpler mathematically . in this case , the problem is equivalent to a directed polymer in a combination of a random potential and a fixed harmonic potential .",
    "the flux line plays the role of the polymer directed along the z - axis .",
    "the cage potential supplies the harmonic part of the potential and the defects , or impurities , the random part .",
    "the problem of directed polymers has been investigated extensively in the literature in the absence of the harmonic piece . here",
    "we follow the approach of mezard and parisi ( mp ) @xcite , who used the so called variational ( or hartree ) approximation .",

    "this temperature is below the bottom of the range plotted in the figures for columnar disorder .",
    "it is thus not necessary to include the rsb solution in the plot .",
    "the analytical expressions given in eqs .",
    "( [ bm ] ) , ( [ bmc ] ) , though quite simple , seem to capture the essential feature required to reproduce the position of the melting line . the qualitative agreement with experimental results is remarkable , especially the opposite effects of point and columnar disorder on the position of the melting line .",
    "the as grown experimental results are , as expected , corresponding to small amount of point disorder .",
    "the effect of point disorder is to increase the transverse excursions of the fl which seeking the best free - energetic configuration .",
    "this increase in the mean square fluctuations lowers the melting temperature for a given magnetic field . at low temperature ,",
    "the entanglement transition is associated in our formalism with rsb , and is a sort of a spin - glass transition in the sense that many minima of the random potential and hence free energy , compete with each other .",
    "this means that there are many possible deformations of the fl which are very close in energy , or free energy . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time the transition into the vortex glass is represented as a rsb transition .    for point disorder , in the limit of infinite cage ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "the variational approximation gives a wandering exponent of 1/2 for a random potential with short ranged correlations @xcite , whereas simulations give a value of 5/8 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy does not seem of importance with respect to the conclusions obtained in this paper since we always consider the case of finite @xmath34 ( which amount to a non - zero magnetic field ) and also consider distances of order @xmath26 in the z - direction .    for columnar disorder , the z - independence of",
    "the random potential tends to reduce the transverse fluctuations of the fl , thus shifting the melting transition to higher temperatures and magnetic fields .",
    "related to this point is the fact that columnar disorder is much more effective in shifting the position of the melting line as compared with point disorder for the range of parameters considered here .",
    "we have used a much weaker value of correlated disorder to achieve a similar or even larger shift of the melting line than for the case of point disorder .",
    "this is again related to the z - independence of the random potential in the columnar case , which help to enhance its effect on the excursions of the vortex lines .",
    "the experiments show that in the case of columnar disorder the transition into the vortex glass seems to be absent . in our model",
    "it corresponds to the fact that rsb does not occur in the temperature range of relevance to the experiments , but rather at significantly lower temperatures for the amount of disorder present .    concerning the apparent deviations of the theoretical curves from the experimental points at high temperatures , we should point out that our expressions are only valid far from @xmath168 which is @xmath16990k for bscco .",
    "close to @xmath0 the melting line can not behave as @xmath170 since it must terminate at @xmath171=0 , @xmath172 .",
    "this comes about because of the temperature dependence of the fundamental constants like the penetration and coherence lengths .",
    "@xcite used a detailed melting theory to obtain a behavior of @xmath173 near @xmath168 .",
    "other authors @xcitepredict a behavior like @xmath174 , which seems to better fit the experimental data for the system under consideration according to ref .",
    ". adding such a correction factor to our expression for @xmath100 can improve the fit at high temperatures .",
    "another point we should mention is that our model incorporates the disorder as depending on a single parameter like @xmath175 or @xmath132 , whereas experimentally there are two parameters which are the density of defects , which is varied experimentally , and their individual strength over which there is not much control .",
    "our model is valid in the limit of very weak impurities which are densely and uniformly distributed in space .",
    "this is quite reasonable for the case of point disorder , but for columnar disorder the experiments involve a rather low density of columnar defects which is smaller than the density of vortices .",
    "thus from the point of view of a single vortex the disorder is not uniformly distributed which may account for the apparent difference in curvature between theory and experiment .",
    "we have shown that the _ cage model _ together with the variational approximation reproduce the main feature of the experiments .",
    "effects of many body interaction between vortex lines which are not taken into account by the effective cage model seem to be of secondary importance .",
    "inclusion of such collective effects within the variational formalism remains a task for the future .",
    "these effects may be responsible for the apparent difference in curvature between the experimental and theoretical curves , for the case of columnar disorder .",
