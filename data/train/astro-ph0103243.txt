    "in paper i ( henden and munari 2000 ) we discussed the need for extended , accurate and homogeneous photometric sequences around symbiotic stars and how their lack has contributed to our currently poor photometric knowledge of these interacting binaries .",
    "we also reviewed the basic types of variability for symbiotic stars and their causes , and provided @xmath1 sequences for a first sample of 20 objects .",
    "this paper ii presents accurate photometric comparison sequences for an additional 20 symbiotic stars using observing strategies , reduction methodologies and presentation layouts strictly similar to those of paper i ( to which the reader is referred for all details ) .",
    "the sequences are intended to allow a general observer to capture on a single ccd frame or to have in the same eyepiece field of view when inspecting archival photographic plates : ( @xmath2 ) enough stars to cover the whole range of known or expected variability for the given symbiotic star , ( @xmath3 ) stars of enough different colors to be able to calibrate the instrumental color equations and therefore reduce to the standard @xmath1 system the collected data , and ( @xmath4 ) stars well separated from surrounding ones to avoid blending at all but the shortest telescope focal lengths . as for paper",
    "i , all observations have been made with the 1.0-m ritchey - chrtien telescope of the u. s. naval observatory , flagstaff station with a tektronix / site 1024x1024 thinned , backside  illuminated ccd and johnson _ ubv _ and kron  cousins _ ri _ filters .",

    "given their complex , non - periodic and usually slow photometric evolution with major outbursts appearing erratically and lasting for years or decades , the understanding of the symbiotic stars and their role in the general astrophysical context can not progress much without a detailed knowledge of their photometric histories and habits .",
    "the program symbiotic stars are listed in table  1 .",
    "an average of 11 stars around each program star have been selected to form the comparison sequences , which are given in table  2 .",
    "the stars included in the sequences have been chosen and ordered on the basis of the @xmath5 band magnitude , because the latter is the band closest to the @xmath6 of the historical photographic observations and is the better suited to investigate the variability of symbiotic stars ( cf .",

    "we have selected from the hipparcos / tycho catalogue suitable , nearby and non - variable stars to complement our comparison sequences .",
    "the selected hipparcos / tycho stars are listed in table  3 , where their @xmath10 magnitudes have been transformed to the standard johnson s _ ubv _ system following the transformation equations provided in the explanatory notes of the hipparcos / tycho catalogue : @xmath11 for sake of completeness we have also reported the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 values as estimated from the observed @xmath15 color using the extensively calibrated relations of caldwell et al .",
    "these transformation relations between colors in the @xmath1 system gives accurate results _ provided _ that the stars belong to the solar neighborhood population , the reddening is not large and the luminosity class is roughly known .",
    "we have assumed all the selected tycho objects to be nearby main sequence stars .",
    "thus , the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 magnitudes reported in the last three columns of table  3 may be considered as guidelines useful for estimating photographic plates .",
