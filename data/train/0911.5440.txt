    "in this paper we consider asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) type metrics on @xmath9-dimensional manifolds with boundary @xmath3 , @xmath10 .",
    "we recall the actual definition of ads space below , but for our purposes the most important feature is the asymptotic of the metric on these spaces , so we start by making a bold general definition . thus , an asymptotically ads type space is a manifold with boundary @xmath3 such that @xmath11 is equipped with a pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath12 of signature @xmath13 which near the boundary @xmath14 of @xmath3 is of the form @xmath15 @xmath16 a smooth symmetric 2-cotensor on @xmath3 such that with respect to some product decomposition of @xmath3 near @xmath14 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a section of @xmath19 ( rather than merely would have variable order , and the restrictions on @xmath6 that arise here , @xmath20 , would have to be modified . ]",
    "@xmath21 ) and is a lorentzian metric on @xmath14 ( with signature @xmath22 ) .",
    "note that @xmath14 is time - like with respect to the conformal metric @xmath23 i.e.  the dual metric @xmath24 of @xmath2 is negative definite on @xmath25 , i.e.  on @xmath26 , in contrast with the asymptotically de sitter - like setting studied in @xcite when the boundary is space - like .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 is _ not _ assumed to be compact ; indeed , under the assumption ( tf ) below , which is useful for global well - posedness of the wave equation , it never is .",
    "let the wave operator @xmath27 be the laplace - beltrami operator associated to this metric , and let @xmath28 be the klein - gordon operator , @xmath29 .",
    "the convention with the positive sign for the ` spectral parameter ' @xmath6 preserves the sign of @xmath6 relative to the @xmath30 component of the metric in both the riemannian conformally compact and the lorentzian de sitter - like cases , and hence is convenient when describing the asymptotics .",
    "we remark that if @xmath31 then up to a change of the ( overall ) sign of the metric , these spaces are asymptotically de sitter , hence the results of @xcite apply .",
    "however , some of the results are different even then , since in the two settings the role of the time variable is reversed , so the formulation of the results differs as the role of ` initial ' and ` boundary ' conditions changes .",
    "these asymptotically ads - metrics are also analogues of the riemannian ` conformally compact ' , or asymptotically hyperbolic , metrics , introduced by mazzeo and melrose @xcite in this form , which are of the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 smooth riemannian on @xmath3 , and @xmath18 is a section of @xmath19 .",
    "these have been studied extensively , in part due to the connection to ads metrics ( so some phenomena might be expected to be similar for ads and asymptotically hyperbolic metrics ) and their riemannian signature , which makes the analysis of related pde easier .",
    "we point out that hyperbolic space actually solves the riemannian version of einstein s equations , while de sitter and anti - de sitter space satisfy the actual hyperbolic einstein equations .",
    "we refer to the works of fefferman and graham @xcite , graham and lee @xcite and anderson @xcite among others for analysis on conformally compact spaces .",
    "we also refer to the works of witten @xcite , graham and witten @xcite and graham and zworski @xcite , and further references in these works , for results in the riemannian setting which are of physical relevance .",
    "there is also a large body of literature on asymptotically de sitter spaces . among others ,",
    "anderson and chruciel studied the geometry of asymptotically de sitter spaces @xcite , while in @xcite the asymptotics of solutions of the klein - gordon equation were obtained , and in @xcite the forward fundamental solution was constructed as a fourier integral operator .",
    "it should be pointed out that the de sitter - schwarzschild metric in fact has many similar features with asymptotically de sitter spaces ( in an appropriate sense , it simply has two de sitter - like ends ) .",
    "a weaker version of the asymptotics in this case is contained in the part of works of dafermos and rodnianski @xcite ( they also study a non - linear problem ) , and local energy decay was studied by bony and hfner @xcite , in part based on the stationary resonance analysis of s barreto and zworski @xcite ; stronger asymptotics ( exponential decay to constants ) was shown in a series of papers with antnio s barreto and richard melrose @xcite .    for the universal cover of ads space itself ,",
    "the klein - gordon equation was studied by breitenlohner and freedman @xcite , who showed its solvability for @xmath20 , @xmath34 , and uniqueness for @xmath35 , in our normalization .",
    "analogues of these results were extended to the dirac equation by bachelot @xcite ; and on exact ads space there is an explicit solution due to yagdjian and galstian @xcite . finally , for a class of perturbations of the universal cover of ads , which still possess a suitable killing vector field , holzegel @xcite recently showed well - posedness for @xmath20 by imposing a boundary condition , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  3.1 ) .",
    "he also obtained certain estimates on the derivatives of the solution , as well as pointwise bounds .",
    "below we consider solutions of @xmath36 , or indeed @xmath37 with @xmath38 given . before describing our results , first we recall a formulation of the conformal problem , namely @xmath39 , so @xmath2 is lorentzian smooth on @xmath3 , and @xmath14 is time - like  at the end of the introduction we give a full summary of basic results in the ` compact ' and ` conformally compact ' riemannian and lorentzian settings , with space - like as well as time - like boundaries in the latter case .",
    "let @xmath40 adding @xmath6 to the operator makes no difference in this case ( unlike for @xmath41 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 is a space - like hypersurface in @xmath3 intersecting @xmath14 ( automatically transversally ) .",
    "then the cauchy problem for the dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath43 @xmath38 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 given , @xmath46 a vector field transversal to @xmath42 , is locally well - posed ( in appropriate function spaces ) near @xmath42 . moreover , under a global condition on the generalized broken bicharacteristic ( or ) flow and @xmath42 , which we recall below in definition  [ def : gen - br - bich ] , the equation is globally well - posed .",
    "namely , the global geometric assumption is that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the bundle projection . in the above formulation of the problem",
    ", we would assume that @xmath42 is a level set , @xmath49  note that locally this is always true in view of the lorentzian nature of the metric and the conditions on @xmath14 and @xmath42 . as is often the case in the presence of boundaries , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  24.1.1 ) and the subsequent remark , it is convenient to consider the special case of the cauchy problem with vanishing initial data and @xmath38 supported to one side of @xmath42 , say in @xmath50 ; one can phrase this as solving @xmath51 this forward cauchy problem is globally well - posed for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the analogous statement also holds for the backward cauchy problem .",
    "here we use hrmander s notation @xmath54 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) , to avoid confusion with the ` zero sobolev spaces ' @xmath55 , which we recall momentarily .",
    "in addition , ( without any global assumptions ) singularities of solutions , as measured by the b - wave front set , @xmath56 , relative to either @xmath57 or @xmath58 , propagate along  as was shown by melrose , sjstrand and taylor @xcite , see also @xcite in the analytic setting . here recall that in @xmath11 , bicharacteristics are integral curves of the hamilton vector field @xmath59 ( on @xmath60 ) of the principal symbol @xmath61 inside the characteristic set , @xmath62 we also recall that the notion of a @xmath63 and an analytic  is somewhat different due to the behavior at diffractive points , with the analytic definition being more permissive ( i.e.  weaker ) . throughout this paper",
    "we use the analytic definition , which we now recall .",
    "first , we need the notion of the compressed characteristic set , @xmath64 of @xmath65 .",
    "this can be obtained by replacing , in @xmath66 , @xmath67 by its quotient @xmath68 , where @xmath25 is the conormal bundle of @xmath14 in @xmath3 .",
    "one denotes then by @xmath64 the image @xmath69 of @xmath70 in this quotient .",
    "one can give a topology to @xmath64 , making a set @xmath71 open if and only if @xmath72 is open in @xmath70 .",
    "this notion of the compressed characteristic set is rather intuitive , since working with the quotient encodes the law of reflection : points with the same tangential but different normal momentum at @xmath14 are identified , which , when combined with the conservation of kinetic energy ( i.e.  working on the characteristic set ) gives the standard law of reflection .",
    "however , it is very useful to introduce another ( equivalent ) definition already at this point since it arises from structures which we also need .",
    "the alternative point of view ( which is what one needs in the proofs ) is that the analysis of solutions of the wave equation takes place on the b - cotangent bundle , @xmath73 ( ` b ' stands for boundary ) , introduced by melrose .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a very detailed description , @xcite for a concise discussion .",
    "invariantly one can define @xmath73 as follows .",
    "first , let @xmath74 be the set of all @xmath63 vector fields on @xmath3 tangent to the boundary .",
    "if @xmath75 are local coordinates on @xmath3 , with @xmath5 defining @xmath14 , elements of @xmath74 have the form @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 smooth .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath74 is the set of all smooth sections of a vector bundle , @xmath79 : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , give local coordinates in terms of .",
    "then @xmath73 is defined as the dual bundle of @xmath79 .",
    "thus , points in the b - cotangent bundle , @xmath73 , of @xmath3 are of the form @xmath82 so @xmath83 give coordinates on @xmath73 .",
    "there is a natural map @xmath84 induced by the corresponding map between sections @xmath85 thus @xmath86 i.e.  @xmath87 , @xmath88 . over the interior of @xmath3 we can identify @xmath89 with @xmath90 , but",
    "this identification @xmath91 becomes singular ( no longer a diffeomorphism ) at @xmath14 .",
    "we denote the image of @xmath70 under @xmath91 by @xmath92 called the compressed characteristic set .",
    "thus , @xmath64 is a subset of the vector bundle @xmath73 , hence is equipped with a topology which is equivalent to the one define by the quotient , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) . the definition of _ analytic _  then becomes :    [ def : gen - br - bich ] _ generalized broken bicharacteristics , _ or , are continuous maps @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is an interval , satisfying that for all @xmath95 real valued , @xmath96    since the map @xmath97 is a derivation , @xmath98 at @xmath70 , so bicharacteristics are merely reparameterized if @xmath99 is replaced by a conformal multiple . in particular , if @xmath41 is the klein - gordon operator , @xmath100 , for an asymptotically ads - metric @xmath12 , the bicharacteristics over @xmath11 are , up to reparameterization , those of @xmath2 .",
    "we make this into our definition of .    the compressed characteristic set @xmath64 of @xmath41",
    "is that of @xmath101 .",
    "generalized broken bicharacteristics , or , of @xmath41 are  _ in the analytic sense _ of the smooth lorentzian metric @xmath2 .",
    "we now give a formulation for the global problem . for this purpose",
    "we need to recall one more class of differential operators in addition to @xmath74 ( which is the set of @xmath63 vector fields _ tangent to the boundary _ ) .",
    "namely , we denote the set of @xmath63 vector fields _ vanishing at the boundary _ by @xmath102 . in local",
    "coordinates @xmath103 , these have the form @xmath104 with @xmath105 ; cf .  .",
    "again , @xmath102 is the set of all @xmath63 sections of a vector bundle , @xmath106 , which over @xmath11 can be naturally identified with @xmath107 ; we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion of 0-geometry and analysis , and to @xcite for a summary .",
    "we then let @xmath108 , resp .",
    "@xmath109 , be the set of differential operators generated by @xmath74 , resp .",
    "@xmath102 , i.e  they are locally finite sums of products of these vector fields with @xmath110-coefficients . in particular ,",
    "@xmath111 which explains the relevance of @xmath109 .",
    "this can be seen easily from @xmath12 being in fact a non - degenerate smooth symmetric bilinear form on @xmath106 ; the conformal factor @xmath112 compensates for the vanishing factors of @xmath5 in , so in fact this is _ exactly _ the same statement as @xmath2 being lorentzian on @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 denote the zero - sobolev space relative to @xmath115 so if @xmath116 is an integer then @xmath117 negative values of @xmath118 give sobolev spaces by dualization .",
    "for our problem , we need a space of ` very nice ' functions corresponding to @xmath108 .",
    "we obtain this by replacing @xmath110 with the space of conormal functions to the boundary relative to a fixed space of functions , in this case @xmath114 , i.e.  functions @xmath119 such that @xmath120 for every @xmath121 ( of any order ) .",
    "the finite order regularity version of this is @xmath122 , which is given for @xmath123 integer by @xmath124 while for @xmath125 integer , @xmath126 if @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "thus , @xmath130 is the dual space of @xmath122 , relative to @xmath131 .",
    "note that in @xmath11 , there is no distinction between @xmath74 , @xmath102 , or indeed simply @xmath132 ( smooth vector fields on @xmath3 ) , so over compact subsets @xmath133 of @xmath11 , @xmath122 is the same as @xmath134 . on the other hand , at @xmath135 , @xmath122 distinguishes precisely between regularity relative to @xmath102 and @xmath74 .",
    "although the finite speed of propagation means that the wave equation has a local character in @xmath3 , and thus compactness of the slices @xmath49 is immaterial , it is convenient to assume @xmath136 even as stated , the propagation of singularities results ( which form the heart of the paper ) do not assume this , and the assumption is made elsewhere merely to make the formulation and proof of the energy estimates and existence slightly simpler , in that one does not have to localize in spatial slices this way .",
    "suppose @xmath20 .",
    "suppose @xmath137 we want to find @xmath138 such that @xmath139 we show that this is locally well - posed near @xmath42 .",

    "suppose @xmath20 . the forward dirichlet problem , , has a unique global solution @xmath138 , and for all compact @xmath140 there exists a compact @xmath141 and a constant @xmath142 such that for all @xmath38 as in , the solution @xmath143 satisfies @xmath144    in fact",

    "we define this notion in definition  [ def : wfb ] and discuss it there in more detail .",
    "however , we recall the definition of the standard wave front set @xmath150 on manifolds without boundary @xmath3 that immediately generalizes to the b - wave front set @xmath56 . thus , one says that @xmath151 is _ not _ in the wave front set of a distribution @xmath143 if there exists @xmath152 such @xmath153 is invertible and @xmath154 for all @xmath155  this is equivalent to @xmath156 by the sobolev embedding theorem . here",
    "@xmath157 can be replaced by @xmath158 instead , with @xmath159 arbitrary .",
    "moreover , @xmath160 can also be defined analogously : we require @xmath161 for @xmath162 elliptic at @xmath163 .",
    "thus , @xmath164 means that @xmath143 is ` microlocally @xmath63 at @xmath163 ' , while @xmath165 means that @xmath143 is ` microlocally @xmath166 at @xmath163 ' .    in order to microlocalize @xmath122 , we need pseudodifferential operators , here extending @xmath108 ( as that is how we measure regularity ) .",
    "these are the b - pseudodifferential operators @xmath167 introduced by melrose , their principal symbol @xmath168 is a homogeneous degree @xmath159 function on @xmath169 ; we again refer to @xcite .",
    "then we say that @xmath170 is _ not _ in @xmath171 if there exists @xmath172 with @xmath173 invertible and such that @xmath174 is @xmath175-conormal to the boundary .",

    "we refer to proposition  [ prop : elliptic ] and theorem  [ thm : prop - sing - im ] for details .",
    "these results indicate already that for @xmath193 there are many interesting questions to answer , and in particular that one can not think of @xmath6 as ` small ' ; this will be the focus of future work .    in particular , if @xmath38 is conormal relative to @xmath200 then @xmath201 .",
    "let @xmath202 denote the branch square root function on @xmath203 $ ] chosen so that takes positive values on @xmath204 .",
    "the simplest conormal functions are those in @xmath110 that vanish to infinite order ( i.e.  with all derivatives ) at the boundary ; the set of these is denoted by @xmath205 .",
    "if we assume @xmath206 then @xmath207 as we show in proposition  [ prop : asymp ] . since the indicial roots of @xmath100 are @xmath208 this explains the interpretation of this problem as a ` dirichlet problem ' , much like it was done in the riemannian conformally compact case by mazzeo and melrose @xcite : asymptotics corresponding to the growing indicial root , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , is ruled out .    for @xmath20 , one can then easily solve the problem with inhomogeneous ` dirichlet ' boundary condition , i.e.  given @xmath211 and @xmath206 , both supported in @xmath212 , @xmath213 if @xmath214 is not an integer .",
    "if @xmath215 is an integer , the same conclusion holds if we replace @xmath210 by @xmath216 ; see theorem  [ thm : inhomog - dirichlet ] .",
    "the operator @xmath217 is the analogue of the dirichlet - to - neumann map , or the scattering operator . in the de sitter",
    "setting the setup is somewhat different as both pieces of scattering data are specified either at past or future infinity , see @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , one expects that the result of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  7 ) , that the scattering operator is a fourier integral operator associated to the  relation can be extended to the present setting , at least if the boundary is totally geodesic with respect to the conformal metric @xmath2 , and the metric is even with respect to the boundary in an appropriate sense . indeed , in an ongoing project , baskin and the author are extending baskin s construction of the forward fundamental solution on asymptotically de sitter spaces , @xcite , to the even totally geodesic asymptotically ads setting . in addition , it is an interesting question what the ` best ' problem to pose is when @xmath193 ; the results of this paper suggest that the global problem ( rather than local , cauchy data versions ) is the best behaved .",
    "one virtue of the parametrix construction is that we expect to be able answer lorentzian analogues of questions related to the work of mazzeo and melrose @xcite , which would bring the lorentzian world of ads spaces significantly closer ( in terms of results ) to the riemannian world of conformally compact spaces .",

    "the @xmath1700 then arise from the theorem of duistermaat and hrmander , using that @xmath1701 implies that the backward  from @xmath1697 can not meet @xmath14 for some time @xmath1702 , uniform in @xmath9  this is essentially due to @xmath1308 being strictly increasing along  microlocally , and @xmath1308 vanishing at @xmath1703 , so as long as @xmath1308 is negative , the  can not hit the boundary .",

    "* proposition  vii.1 ) gives a very nice presentation , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of theorem  8.1 ) for an overview with more details .",
    "the rough idea for constructing the  @xmath1054 for is to define approximations to it using proposition  [ prop : tgt - prop ] .",
    "first , recall that in proposition  [ prop : tgt - prop ] , applied at @xmath1299 , @xmath1586 is the coordinate projection ( push forward ) of @xmath59 , evaluated at @xmath1049 , to @xmath1614 .",
    "thus , one should think of the point @xmath1705 in @xmath1614 as an @xmath1706 approximation of where a backward  should be after ` time ' ( i.e.  parameter value ) @xmath648 .",
    "this is used as follows : given @xmath624 , proposition  [ prop : tgt - prop ] gives the existence of a point @xmath1707 in @xmath1708 which is , roughly speaking , @xmath1706 from @xmath1709 , with @xmath1710 being @xmath1706 as well .",
    "then , from @xmath1707 , one can repeat this procedure ( replacing @xmath1299 by @xmath1707 in proposition  [ prop : tgt - prop ] )  there are some technical issues corresponding to @xmath1707 being in the boundary or not , and also whether in the former case the backward  hits the boundary in time @xmath648 .",
    "taking @xmath1711 , this gives @xmath1712 points @xmath1713 corresponding to the dyadic points on the parameter interval @xmath1714 $ ] .",
    "it is helpful to consider this as analogous to a discrete approximation of solving an ode without the presence of the boundary by taking steps of size @xmath1715 . defining @xmath1716 for only these dyadic values , one",
    "can then get a subsequence @xmath1717 which converges , as @xmath1240 , at @xmath1718 for all @xmath1719 and @xmath1720 integers .",
    "( note that @xmath1721 is defined for these values of @xmath1106 for @xmath118 sufficiently large ! )",
    "one then checks as in lebeau s proof that the result is the restriction of a  to dyadic parameter values .",
    "again , we refer to lebeau s paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  vii.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of theorem  8.1 ) for more detail .",

    "then an actual backward  can be constructed as in the works of melrose and sjstrand @xcite , and lebeau @xcite .",
    "this proposition reiterates the importance of the constraint on @xmath6 in that @xmath1730 for @xmath1731 ; for @xmath1732 , the growth or decay relative to @xmath149 does not distinguish between the two approximate solutions @xmath1733 , @xmath277 .    for the first part of the lemma , by lemma  [ lemma : wfb - infty - independence ] and the subsequent remark , under our assumptions we have @xmath1734 . by , @xmath1735 this is , up to a change in overall the sign of the second summand , @xmath1736 the same as the analogous expression in the de sitter setting , see the first line of the proof of lemma  4.13 of @xcite .",
    "thus , the proof of that lemma goes through without changes  the reader needs to keep in mind that @xmath1737 excludes one of the indicial roots from appearing in the argument of that lemma .",
