    "the present paper is rooted in the conviction that the basic property of an insulator is that it insulate .",
    "magnetic order is a secondary effect which , though it may be one of the appurtenances of insulating behavior , is not synonymous with it .",
    "this premise underlies our recent discussion of the phase diagram of the underdoped cuprate superconductors , where we relied upon the notion of an insulator as a vortex condensate@xcite .",
    "we would like , here , to elucidate and expand upon this paradigm . as a by - product of this approach",
    ", we find a precise distinction between spin - charge separated and confined insulators .",
    "since correlated insulators often exhibit magnetism , they are typically described by their magnetic order parameters .",
    "furthermore , in commensurate , weak coupling models , the development of magnetic order can be the mechanism by which a system becomes insulating .",
    "this has led to the conflation of magnetic order with insulating behavior . however , this state of affairs is both unsatisfying and incomplete since magnetic order can persist even when the system becomes conducting and , conversely , a system can be insulating even in the absence of magnetic order , as exemplified by the nodal liquid .",
    "hence , it would behoove us to seek an order parameter which is directly related to the electrical properties of an insulator .",
    "the difficulty in such a program is that an insulator seems more disordered than a conductor since most correlation functions in the charge sector are short - ranged .",
    "we interpret this as suggesting a ` dual ' approach based on a ` disorder ' parameter .",
    "distilling the key elements of our nodal liquid construction , we propose that the appearance of a non - zero expectation value for a ` disorder ' parameter signals insulating behavior .",
    "the relation between the conduction properties of a system and spontaneous symmetry breaking in a dual order parameter is perhaps most transparent in the field - theoretical formulation of duality.@xcite  in this version of the transformation , the dual theory is constructed to implement local charge continuity , which is a _ dynamical _ consequence of u(1 ) symmetry in the original hamiltonian , as a rigid _ constraint _ ( dynamics in the dual theory implies conservation of _ vorticity _ ) .",
    "this construction is quite familiar from the one - dimensional theory of luttinger liquids@xcite .",
    "there , the two - current can be written in terms of a phase field @xmath4 as @xmath5 in the alternative , but equivalent , dual description , the current can be written in terms of a dual field , @xmath6 : @xmath7 in a one - dimensional mott insulator , the @xmath8 field acquires a mass , implying a gap in the spectrum of charge excitations , and hence , experimentally , in the optical conductivity . note that massive dynamics for the _ phase _ field @xmath9 is inconsistent since it would violate charge conservation @xmath10 .",
    "the one - dimensional model has thus communicated an important lesson : insulating behavior occurs when a gap is acquired by the dual field representing the current operator .",
    "this description of mott insulators generalizes readily to two - dimensional _ bosons_.",
    "let us write the boson annihilation operator , @xmath11 , in terms of its amplitude and phase : @xmath12 .",
    "in the superfluid state , we fix @xmath13 and describe the system by its phase degree of freedom , @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 we can model the destruction of superfluidity by introducing a vortex field , @xmath16 ; effectively , we are reducing the amplitude degree of freedom to a vortex field which keeps track of the points at which it vanishes .",
    "we can represent the current , @xmath17 , as@xcite @xmath18 which is the natural extension of eq .",
    "[ thetafield ] to two - dimensions .",
    "this parameterization is highly redundant as a result of its invariance under the gauge symmetry : @xmath19 for an arbitrary function , @xmath20 .",
    "this gauge symmetry is enormously larger than the analogous global invariance in the one - dimensional luttinger liquid , @xmath21 .",
    "the vortices see the gauge field , @xmath22 , according to the magnus force law , so the dual lagrangian takes the form @xmath23 in the superfluid state , vortices are gapped and the bosons condense , while in the mott insulating state , the vortices condense and the bosons become gapped ( at the chemical potential ) .",
    "when the vortices condense , @xmath22 becomes massive by the anderson - higgs mechanism . as a consequence , the system is insulating .",
    "let us abstract away the archetypal features of this system .",
    "we can introduce the representation ( [ dualcurrent ] ) for any conserved current in two - dimensions , so we can certainly use it for the electrical current in the fermionic system of our choice . in order to carry the rest of this scheme over to electronic systems",
    ", we must find a way for the system to conspire to make @xmath22 massive .",
    "the only way that this can happen which is consistent with the gauge symmetry ( [ gauge ] ) , is via the anderson - higgs mechanism.@xcite  since the anderson - higgs phenomenon can only take place if there is a condensate which is coupled to @xmath22 according to the magnus force law ( eq .   [ dualbosons ] ) ,",
    "we are led to the following question : how do you define a vortex field in a fermionic system ?",
    "one possibility is to implement statistical transmutation to represent the fermions as bosons coupled to an auxiliary chern - simons gauge field@xcite .",
    "then , we can define vortices in the bosonic field .",
    "this approach is probably suitable for describing a conventional antiferromagnet , as discussed very briefly in section iv .",
    "but in this paper we pursue a different tack - using cooper pairs as the bosons .",
    "this is quite promising for the cuprates because it is tailor - made for insulators which contain the germ of superconductivity .",
    "a new question rears its head when we consider an insulator which descends in this way from a superconductor : do the finite - energy excitations inherit their quantum numbers from the superconducting state , or do they simply have the electron quantum numbers ?",
    "in particular , one can ask what is the energy of an isolated neutral spin-@xmath24 excitation . if this diverges with system size , then spin and charge are confined .",
    "if , on the other hand , it is finite , as it is in a superconductor , then the insulator exhibits spin - charge separation .",
    "a band insulator is , of course , a state of the former variety .",
    "as we show in the next section , it can be understood ( rather differently than in elementary textbooks ) as resulting from the condensation of flux @xmath2 vortices in a state with @xmath25-wave pairing .",
    "spin and charge are confined as a result of the aharonov - bohm phase which a spinful excitation acquires as it orbits an @xmath2 vortex ; an isolated spin-@xmath24 has logarithmically divergent energy in @xmath0 .",
    "this spin - charge confinement physics is also present in a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) insulator , which occurs for example in the negative @xmath26 ( extended ) hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "there , however , the @xmath2 vortex condensation leads to translational symmetry - breaking .",
    "in both instances the resulting insulating phase can be viewed as a  crystal \" of charge @xmath27  cooper \" pairs . for @xmath0 electronic systems at or near half - filling with strong on - site repulsion",
    ", however , such cdw order is physically unreasonable , and for the cuprate materials can be discarded on phenomenological grounds .",
    "for this reason we are led to consider the possibility of the condensation of double strength @xmath3 vortices in a superconducting pair field@xcite .",
    "the mott insulator which arises at half - filling upon condensation of @xmath3 vortices has a number of appealing and remarkable properties .",
    "the insulating phase is translationally invariant , in contrast to the cdw .",
    "moreover , since there are no aharonov - bohm phase factors when a spin @xmath24 is transported around an @xmath3 vortex , the resulting mott insulator exhibits _ spin - charge _ separation@xcite . for a d - wave superconductor appropriate to the cuprates , condensation of @xmath3 vortices leads directly to the _",
    "nodal liquid_. the nodal liquid indeed posseses _ gapless _ spin @xmath24 but charge neutral fermions - the nodons - which descend directly from the d - wave quasiparticles",
    ". as we shall see , there are also massive charge @xmath28 spinless boson excitations in the nodal liquid phase . these  holons \" are solitonic _ topological _ excitations in the underlying @xmath3 condensate , a dual analog of abrikosov flux tubes .",
    "the excitations in the nodal liquid have the same quantum numbers as in the spin - charge separated gauge theories@xcite , but are weakly interacting , rather than strongly coupled by a gauge field .",
    "a peculiar feature of the nodal liquid is that spin - charge separation survives the ordering of the nodal spins into a phase with long - ranged antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this novel phase - denoted af * - which has gapped nodons is distinct from the conventional nel antiferromagnet , af , which does not have neutral , spin @xmath24 excitations even at high energies@xcite .",
    "these two phases are physically very different , as may be seen from simple _ gedanken _ experiments which make the point that charge @xmath28 can be physically separated from spin @xmath24 with finite energy cost in the af * but not the af phase . however , in two - dimensions nodon - holon bound states form in the af * phase , so the spin - charge separation is not so easily found in the electron spectral function .",
    "our ultimate goal is to describe a novel spin - charge separated state , the nodal liquid , and an ordered state which can result from it , af*. along the way , however , we will re - examine a number of seemingly quotidian states such as the band insulator , the charge - density - wave , and the antiferromagnet . our broader framework will enable us to understand the physics of doping these insulators from the point of view of creating topological excitations in the ` disorder ' parameter @xcite .",
    "such a point of view naturally leads to a discussion of the possibility of spin - charge separation in these states . in sections",
    "ii and iiia , we will illustrate the physics of flux @xmath2 condensation in systems with attractive electron - electron interactions , where we expect the insulating states to be related to @xmath25-wave superconductivity . in the resulting states , the band insulator and the cdw , spin and charge",
    "are confined , as we discuss at length in section ii . in section iiib",
    ", we then consider flux @xmath3 vortex condensates in a @xmath29-wave superconductor , filling in a gap in our earlier paper .",
    "we introduce an effective lattice model in section iiic which incorporates this physics . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the spin - charge separated antiferromagnet , af * , and compare it to the conventional antiferromagnet , af .",
    "possible experimental signatures are analyzed .",
    "we conclude with some summary remarks in section v , relegating some supporting technical details to the appendix .",
    "in the absence of electron interactions , a band insulator with two electrons per unit cell corresponds to a filled valence band of non - interacting levels . provided the interactions",
    "are small compared to the energy gap to the conduction band this should provide a good description of the phase .",
    "but even with stronger interactions a band insulator can be adiabatically deformed ( without gap closure ) back to the non - interacting state . to obtain an order parameter for the band insulator , we will attempt to describe this phase as a  quantum disordered \" s - wave superconductor .    to this end , consider spinful electrons moving in the two - dimensional continuum . in the presence of a local attractive interaction",
    "the fermi surface is unstable , and presumed to form a spin - singlet s - wave superconducting phase , with energy gap @xmath30 .",
    "now imagine introducing a periodic potential with magnitude @xmath31 and a period corresponding to two electrons per unit cell .",
    "for @xmath31 much smaller than @xmath30 the superconducting phase should be stable , but with increasing @xmath31 one expects an eventual quantum transition into a band insulator .",
    "this transition can be described as a quantum vortex unbinding transition , analogous to the thermally driven kosterlitz - thouless transition . at zero temperature",
    "the vortices can condense , giving one an order parameter for the band insulator .    of particular interest",
    "is the nature of the gapped excitations in the two phases . as we shall discuss , in a superconductor it is possible to define charge neutral quasiparticles@xcite , which carry spin @xmath24 .",
    "in an s - wave superconductor these  spinon \" excitations are fully gapped@xcite , but can be gapless ( called nodons ) in a d - wave superconductor which we return to in section iv below . since the cooper pairs carry no spin in a singlet superconductor , the cooper pairs and spinons provide a natural spin - charge separated description of the superconducting phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitations in a band insulator are electrons which of course carry both spin and charge - the band insulator does _ not _ exhibit spin - charge separation .",
    "we would like to try and understand the mechanism whereby the separated spin and charge excitations in the superconductor become  confined \" upon entering the band insulator .    to address these issues",
    "it is convenient to consider a low energy effective theory for an s - wave superconductor in which both cooper pairs and the gapped quasiparticle states near the fermi surface are retained .",
    "the appropriate lagrangian takes the form : @xmath32 with @xmath33 c(x,\\tau )    , \\ ] ] @xmath34 @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes an electron with spin @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the phase of the pair field , with magnitude @xmath39 .",
    "integrating over high energy electron states well away from the fermi surface , will generate dynamics for the phase field .",
    "the appropriate form of @xmath40 at low energy is essentially determined by symmetry .",
    "here we have retained the leading order terms in a gradient expansion , with @xmath41 the compressibility and @xmath42 a superfluid stiffness .",
    "henceforth we will set the velocity @xmath43 .",
    "in general a berry s phase term@xcite of the form @xmath44 is allowed ( see section iii below ) but with one cooper pair ( two electrons ) per unit cell of the periodic potential @xmath45 and the berry s phase term can be dropped since @xmath46 .",
    "notice that the phase fluctuations are strongly coupled to the electron operators through @xmath47 . to decouple this interaction and to exhibit the spin - charge separation it is convenient to consider the change of variables : @xmath48",
    "the lagrangian becomes , @xmath49 with @xmath50 f_\\alpha +   |\\delta | f_\\uparrow(x ) f_\\downarrow(x ) + h.c .   , \\ ] ] and @xmath51 is a quasiparticle 3-current operator : @xmath52 this current is not conserved as a result of the anomalous term ( [ anom ] ) , but the spin currents , @xmath53 are conserved .",
    "here we have assumed that the phase field is slowly varying and have dropped terms involving two spatial gradients of @xmath38 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath54 can be diagonalized as usual by a bogoliubov transformation , and describes gapped quasiparticles .",
    "since the @xmath55 operators are electrically neutral but carry spin one - half , these excitations are  spinons \" .",
    "the spinons are coupled to the phase fluctuations via a doppler shift type term . in the superconducting phase",
    "these phase fluctuations are small , and will generate a weak interaction between the gapped spinon states .    to quantum disorder the superconducting phase and arrive at a description of the band insulator , we will need to allow for vortices in the phase of the pair field . in two - dimensions vortices are simply whorls of current swirling around a core region .",
    "the circulation of such vortices is _ quantized _ , since upon encircling the core the phase @xmath38 can only change by integer multiples of @xmath56 .",
    "elementary \" vortices have a phase winding of @xmath57 . since the cooper pairs have charge @xmath27 , in the presence of an applied magnetic field these vortices quantize flux in units of @xmath2 . inside the core of a vortex",
    "the _ magnitude _ of the complex order parameter @xmath58 vanishes , but is essentially constant outside . since the position of these  point - like \" vortices can change with time , their dynamics requires a quantum mechanical description . thus a collection of many vortices can be viewed as a many body system of  point - like \" particles . since positive ( @xmath59 ) and negative ( @xmath60 ) circulation vortices",
    "can annihilate and disappear they behave as  relativistic \" particles .",
    "there is a conserved vortex  charge \" in this process , namely the total circulation , and an associated current",
    ". a duality transformation can be implemented@xcite in which the phase @xmath38 is replaced by a dual field , @xmath8 , which is the phase of a vortex complex field , @xmath61 . in a hamiltonian description , @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be viewed as vortex quantum field operators - which destroy and create vortices .",
    "a crucial element in the duality transformation is the total electrical three - current , @xmath64 , which must be conserved even in the dual representation .",
    "this is achieved by expressing the current as a curl of a gauge field , @xmath22@xcite : @xmath65 which automatically implies the continuity equation @xmath66 .",
    "this representation also introduces a gauge symmetry into the problem , @xmath67 .",
    "it is this gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken in the band insulating state .    in ref .",
    "the duality transformation was implemented in the presence of the doppler - shift interaction between the cooper pairs and the spinons , giving a dual lagrangian of the form : @xmath68 with a vortex piece of the ginzburg - landau form , @xmath69 and @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath72 are dual  electric \" and  magnetic \" fields .",
    "the dual magnetic field @xmath73 is simply the total charge density ( in units of the cooper pair charge ) .",
    "the last term in @xmath74 is the only one coupling the spinons to the vortices .",
    "however , this dual lagrangian is not valid since it ignores a strong statistical gauge interaction between spinons and hc/2e vortices . to see this consider taking a spinon ( @xmath55 ) around a closed loop which encircles an hc/2e vortex . along this circuit",
    "the phase @xmath38 winds by @xmath75 . due to the @xmath24 in eqn .",
    "( [ nodondef ] ) this implies that the spinon @xmath55 must change sign upon completing this circuit .",
    "this can be formally implemented by introducing branch cuts emanating from each and every vortex , across which the fermion wavefunction must change sign .",
    "this represents a strong and long - ranged  statistical \" interaction between the spinons and hc/2e vortices .",
    "the presence of this long - ranged interaction clearly invalidates the form of the dual lagrangian .",
    "one is tempted to try and incorporate the branch cuts by introducing two new gauge fields coupled together by a chern - simons interaction@xcite .",
    "the most natural way of doing this is to introduce a coupling @xmath76 of the nodons to a gauge field @xmath77 which attaches half of a fictitious flux quantum to each vortex .",
    "however , such a coupling is not gauge invariant since the nodon current , @xmath51 is not conserved . to avoid this problem  but at the cost of breaking spin - rotational invariance ",
    "we couple @xmath77 to the @xmath78-component of the nodon spin current , which is conserved .",
    "specifically , let @xmath77 and @xmath79 denote statistical gauge fields coupled to the spinons and vortices , respectively , with a modified dual lagrangian : @xmath80 and a chern - simons interaction : @xmath81 the chern - simons term effectively attaches flux tubes with strength @xmath24 to each of the spinons and vortices .",
    "this follows from the equations of motion obtained from @xmath82 and @xmath83 which imply , respectively , @xmath84 and @xmath85 here , the vortex three - current is given by , @xmath86    .\\ ] ]    consider now trying to condense the hc/2e vortices . in the ground state the spinon ( @xmath55-fermions ) are gapped out with @xmath87 , so one can presumably set @xmath88 .",
    "setting @xmath89 corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry , and leads to an effective higgs lagrangian : @xmath90 . in terms of the dual ginzburg - landau theory",
    "this describes the  meissner state \" .",
    "but since the curl of @xmath22 corresponds to the total electrical current , this phase corresponds to an insulator - the band insulator - with a charge gap .",
    "if the dual ginzburg - landau theory is type ii it will exhibit topological excitations corresponding to penetrating quantized  dual \" flux tubes . in the electronic insulator these correspond to gapped charge @xmath91 spin - zero states , which are two - electron bound states .    but now consider an excited state in the insulator which carries spin @xmath24 .",
    "this can be created by adding a spinon at the origin by acting with @xmath92 .",
    "the presence of a spinon induces a statistical gauge field from the chern - simons term : @xmath93 since @xmath94 corresponds to an applied  magnetic field \" in the dual ginzburg - landau theory , adding a spinon is equivalent to the insertion of a solenoid carrying one - half of a ( dual ) flux quantum .",
    "being in the meissner state , the dual ginzburg - landau theory will tend to screen out this applied magnetic field by generating currents that induce an opposing internal field , @xmath95 .",
    "this follows readily from the energy in the meissner state which takes the form : @xmath96 where we have put @xmath97 . with both @xmath98 and @xmath99 the energy in the presence of the solenoid will diverge logarithmically with system size",
    "apparently , the energy of an isolated spinon diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "but in the presence of an induced internal magnetic field the energy will be finite provided the integrated flux is precisely one - half of the dual flux quantum : @xmath100    in physical terms this corresponds to an induced cloud of electric charge with magnitude @xmath28 .",
    "evidently , in the insulating phase an isolated @xmath101 excitation will bind charge @xmath28 to form a spin - up electron .",
    "the resulting excitation has finite energy .",
    "similarly , an isolated @xmath102 will bind charge @xmath103 to form a spin - down hole with the same energy as the spin - up electron .",
    "this mechanism for confinement of spin and charge is reminiscent of the confinement of charge and flux which occurs in the quantum hall effect . in the bosonic chern - simons formulation of the quantum hall effect",
    ", the confinement of charge and flux also arises via a higgs mechanism - in this case when the composite boson condenses .    for the above ginzburg - landau / chern - simons theory",
    "there is another finite energy configuration in the presence of a single @xmath101 - a @xmath56 winding in the phase @xmath8 of the vortex field together with an internal field of one - half quantum which _ aligns _ with the  applied flux \" ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this creates a finite energy excitation with spin one - half and charge @xmath103 , corresponding to a conventional spin - up hole . we can create a spin - down electron of equal energy in a similar manner . on physical grounds the energy of the @xmath105 states",
    "should clearly be degenerate .",
    "unfortunately , for the above ginzburg - landau / chern - simons theory while both energies are finite , they will in general be different , due to differences in the core energies ( eg .",
    "near the @xmath102 state with @xmath8 winding , it is necessary to suppress the magnitude of @xmath62 to zero ) .",
    "this signals a clear deficiency in the chern - simons formulation of the  statistical \" interaction between spinons and hc/2e vortices .",
    "since the vortices and spinons can sense the _ sign _ of the statistical flux ( that is @xmath106 flux quanta are _ not _ identical ) the chern - simons fields do not give a faithful representation of the branch cuts .",
    "the necessary evil of breaking spin - rotational symmetry is a consequence of this asymmetry in the chern - simons formulation .",
    "currently , we do not have a convenient formulation of interacting hc/2e vortices and spinons which correctly respects this symmetry .",
    "such a formulation would be particularly desirable for the case of a d - wave superconductor where the quasiparticles are gapless .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the chern - simons formulation does help elucidate the correct mechanism behind confinement of spin and charge upon condensation of hc/2e vortices .",
    "the preceding considerations dovetail naturally with the following approach to understanding spin - charge separation .",
    "consider the following _ gedanken _ experiment , for which we are indebted to b. i. halperin@xcite , which probes the existence of spin - charge separation .",
    "consider a totally gapped system which exhibits spin - charge separation , meaning that it has weakly - coupled neutral spin @xmath24 excitations  to which we ll liberally apply the term nodons ( even though the rest of our discussion applies also to systems which have nothing to do with @xmath29-wave superconductivity ) , following ref .",
    " and charge @xmath28 spin - less excitations  which we ll call holons , following ref .  .",

    "the perturbation favors localizing a charge @xmath28 _ without spin _ near @xmath112 and a spin @xmath24 _ without charge _ near @xmath113 .",
    "now imagine taking @xmath114 ( the lattice spacing ) , so that the points are well separated . for small",
    "@xmath115 , the ground state of the system will be unchanged , since there is a gap to all excitations . increasing @xmath115",
    "will ultimately induce a change in the ground state to take advantage of these perturbations .",
    "provided @xmath110 is taken larger than the size of the nodon and holon , these excitations can come into the system to lower its energy and will be localized in the wells .",
    "this change in the ground state will occur at finite @xmath115 , since the energy gap to the nodon and holon is finite , and indeed the critical @xmath115 will saturate as @xmath116 .",
    "one can interpret this critical @xmath117 as the minimum energy needed to produce an unbound nodon - holon pair .",
    "now imagine repeating the same experiment on a band insulator or any other state which does not exhibit spin - charge separation . in this case , the nodon and holon are not available to `` fill '' the local perturbations . instead the system must create a non - local superposition of elementary excitations , i.e. develop a polarization , to localize the desired charge @xmath28 or spin @xmath24 .",
    "consider for example the region around the point @xmath112 , in which a charge @xmath28 should localize .",
    "a simple and generic model for a band insulator is a collection of deep potential wells , each containing two electrons .",
    "for the low - energy states , the wells may be approximated as quadratic and , in the ground state , all electrons are in the lowest harmonic oscillator level .",
    "the lowest excited states which do not induce local spin textures are constructed simply by moving both electrons in one of the wells from the ground state to one of the first excited states with energy gap @xmath118 .",
    "a convenient basis for these states is the set @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the raising operator along the @xmath121 axis in space .",

    "the state @xmath125 represents a small displacement of the electrons , i.e. @xmath126 thus it possesses a dipole moment @xmath127 , and a local charge may be built up by polarizing the collection of all the electrons near the point @xmath112 ( i.e. forming a many body state which is a direct product of single - particle states with differing displacements on each site ) .",
    "we consider a slowly - varying displacement @xmath128 for which a continuum description is adequate ( although this is not a necessary restriction ) . far away from the point @xmath112 ,",
    "the induced charge density @xmath129 , and hence the charge in a given region @xmath130 is @xmath131 .",
    "the radially symmetric configuration @xmath132 thus carries a total charge @xmath28 .",
    "provided all the electrons are involved in the texture , there is no net spin polarization .",
    "this polarized state is not an eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian , but does couple favorably to the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : perturbations ] .",
    "we can however determine the expectation value of the ( unperturbed ) energy in this state .",
    "the result is essentially classical : @xmath133 . in two dimensions ,",
    "this integral is logarithmically divergent , @xmath134 .",
    "the isolated long - range polarization thus cost an _",
    "infinite _ energy . in the thought experiment",
    ", this divergence will be cut off by the finite distance between @xmath112 and @xmath135 , since we may localize an oppositely charged texture around the point @xmath135 in combination with an added electron with @xmath136 , thus satisfying both perturbations and rendering the energy finite . however , the critical @xmath117 will grow logarithmically as @xmath137 , and hence it becomes impossible to create the isolated holon and nodon in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this argument is appealing in that it agrees with the earlier chern - simons calculations which suggested logarithmic confinement of holons and spinons . as a means of distinguishing spin - charge",
    "separated from spin - charge confined phases , however , it is somewhat delicate . in particular",
    ", it fails for @xmath138 , where the polarization energy to create the charge @xmath28 texture becomes finite .",
    "it is also somewhat unsatisfying because the texture is not an eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "fortunately , the duality formalism allows the two phases to be distinguished instead by the dual order parameter @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath62 condenses , the statistical gauge interactions between nodons and the condensing vortices leads to spin - charge confinement in @xmath139 . in this sense @xmath62",

    ", we only mention a few salient points here .",
    "the difference between the cdw and the band insulator in the present approach is that the berry s phase term@xcite , @xmath140 can not be dropped . to appreciate the physics of this term",

    "[ lphi ] , together with the berry s phase term ( eq .  [ lberry ] ) , takes the form : @xmath141 here , @xmath142 is the cooper pair number operator which is canonically conjugate to @xmath38 . because , at half - filling , there is , on average , half a cooper pair per site",
    ", one has @xmath143 .",
    "implementing duality as before@xcite ( but now on the lattice ) gives a dual euclidean action which is the lattice analogue of eq .",
    "[ ldualv ]  and eq .  [ lduala ] , the only difference being that the maxwell term , @xmath144 , term is replaced by : @xmath145    the new feature , as compared to the last section , is the  off - set \" charge @xmath146 which results from the berry phase term ( [ lberry ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to an applied ",
    "magnetic \" field for the lattice ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the insulating cdw phase of the cooper pairs corresponds to an abrikosov flux lattice in this dual representation . as in the case of the band insulator",
    ", the vortex condensate leads to a charge gap and insulating behavior .",
    "generally , one expects that a condensation of @xmath2 vortices will lead to charge ordering with charge @xmath27 per unit cell .",
    "this follows from the underlying duality : @xmath2 vortices pick up a @xmath56 phase change upon encircling charge @xmath27 cooper pairs  the same phase accumulated when a cooper pair encircles such a vortex .",
    "thus , the liberation and condensation of @xmath2 vortices leads to a charge quantization in units of @xmath27 . for the model with attractive interactions and",
    "one electron per unit cell considered above , the resulting state is the ( charge @xmath27 ) cooper pair crystal .",
    "we now turn to the interesting problem of the quantum - disordered _ d - wave _ superconductor .",
    "d - wave superconductivity is thought to arise from the combination of strong on - site coulomb repulsion and some unspecified ( and controversial ) longer - range attraction on the scale of a few lattice spacings .",
    "certainly strong local repulsion is a key ingredient of the cuprates . for such systems ,",
    "the @xmath2 vortex condensation described above  which implies considerable double occupancy ( at least in a region near half - filling )  is physically unreasonable .",
    "it must also be discarded on phenomenological grounds , as the actual undoped antiferromagnet is a mott insulator without charge ordering .",
    "although @xmath2-flux vortex unbinding is untenable for this case , phase coherence must nevertheless still be destroyed to obtain an insulating state .",
    "charge uniformity and phase disruption can both be achieved together by unbinding bound _",
    "pairs _ of vortices with flux @xmath3 instead of isolated ones .",
    "we expect such a _ double - vortex condensate _ to appear in the dual description as a condensate with a doubled dual charge , and hence a halved dual flux quantum@xcite . at half - filling then",
    ", the dual lattice ginzburg - landau theory has a full @xmath56 flux per plaquette and thus , as desired , exhibits no translational symmetry breaking .    having motivated double - vortex condensation in the d - wave case",
    ", we now proceed to discuss its implementation .",
    "the calculations are significantly different because of an important additional physical ingredient in the d - wave superconductor : gapless fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "these excitations arise owing to the vanishing of the amplitude of the pair wavefunction at its nodes in momentum space .",
    "the presence of low - energy fermionic excitations necessitates a careful reinvestigation of the duality transformation and its implications .",
    "much of the necessary calculations and formalism was discussed in detail in ref .  , and is briefly recapitulated in the appendix .",
    "as for the s - wave case , the analysis of the interactions of vortices with quasiparticles is based on the neutralizing change of variables in eq .",
    ". the distinctive feature of the d - wave superconductor is that the neutral spin-@xmath24 particles are _ gapless _ , and can be described by a dirac hamiltonian . because in this case the spinons near the nodes can contribute to low - energy physics , we attribute to them special significance and the name _ nodons _ , signifying the low - energy spinons descended from the d - wave nodal quasiparticles .",
    "being gapless , they can be described by continuum field theory and a 4-component dirac spinor @xmath11 ( the analog of @xmath55 in sec .",
    "ii  see the appendix for a precise definition ) .",
    "having already argued that only @xmath3-flux vortices should be considered , we will focus primarily on this simpler case .",
    "it is however , appropriate at this point to reflect briefly on the consequences of these strong gauge interactions should single - strength vortices become important low - energy excitations . as above , @xmath2-vortex unbinding gives rise to strong gauge interactions of the spinons , now nodons .",
    "the gauge - theoretical arguments given in sec .",
    "ii can be again carried through , and we expect confinement of the nodons .",
    "unlike the s - wave case , however , because the nodons are gapless excitations , their presence or absence has definite consequences on the _ ground state _ correlations .",
    "for instance , in a pure d - wave superconductor , the gapless dirac excitations lead to static ( equal time ) power - law spin correlations and a @xmath147-linear magnetic susceptibility .",
    "it is natural to expect that the removal of the nodons from the low - energy spectrum in the insulator will be accompanied by the condensation of some pairing operator ( for example , spin - density - wave order is characterized by the order parameter @xmath148 ; other possibilities are legion ) , in most cases accompanied by a gap for the reconfined electrons.@xcite  the formation of such a paired - nodon state is analogous to _ chiral symmetry breaking _ in qcd , and in that context as well is generally believed to accompany confinement ( although the converse need not be true ) .",
    "one can imagine approaching such a state from the superconductor by continuously lowering the vortex `` mass '' to zero , at which point one has a theory in which gapless fermionic nodons interact with gapless bosonic vortices via strong gauge interactions .",
    "this putative critical point is a tempting starting point for future systematic studies of such instabilities .",
    "we now return to the problem of @xmath3 vortex condensation , which , although motivated on energetic grounds , has dramatic consequences for the elementary excitations .",
    "examining again eq .",
    "2.4  when only double - strength vortices are present , @xmath38 is defined modulo @xmath149 , and this transformation defines a single - valued neutral fermion .",
    "the nodons thus experience no statistical gauge interactions in this case .",
    "the results obtained in ref .  , which ignored gauge interactions , hence apply to the @xmath3 condensate , with the proviso that the fundamental vorticity must be doubled throughout the analysis .",
    "the salient result is that when gauge effects are absent , the nodons and vortices interact only via the two - fluid interaction lagrangian @xmath150 where @xmath51 is the electrical current carried by the quasiparticles , and is bilinear in the @xmath11 fields .",
    "[ eq : lint ]  can be understood as the doppler shift of the nodon energies in a superflow given by @xmath151 .",
    "this is a much weaker coupling than the statistical gauge interactions in the single - vortex condensate , and controlled analytic calculations are possible .",
    "detailed predictions for this quantum - disordered state , the _ nodal liquid _ ( nl ) , can be derived by writing a coarse - grained continuum theory for @xmath152 and @xmath22 , as in refs .  .",
    "the key conclusions are : ( 1 ) gapless nodons survive into the nl state , carrying spin but neither charge nor current at low frequencies ; ( 2 ) the nl has gapped charged excitations , the lowest - lying of which are expected to be ( spinless ) charge @xmath153 holons , which occur as vortices in the dual order parameter @xmath152 ; ( 3 ) the half - filled nl has uniform charge density , and upon ( hole ) doping charge is introduced as a spin - less wigner crystal with charge @xmath28 per unit cell ( but see sec .",
    "iv for a discussion of how this may be modified when antiferromagnetism is present ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that a connection has been made here between two apparently unrelated phenomena . by _",
    "assuming _ double - vortex condensation , characterized by the dual order parameters @xmath154 ( double vortices are condensed ) , @xmath155 ( single vortices are bound ) , we were led to the persistence of spin - charge deconfinement in the insulator .",
    "the single - vortex disorder parameter , @xmath62 ( which also distinguishes translational symmetry breaking at half - filling ) can thus be regarded as an _ order parameter for confinement_.      we conclude this section by describing a direct route to the nl at half - filling , by which most of its properties may be derived without the use of the duality mapping .",
    "to do so , consider the following lattice regularization , which forbids @xmath2-flux vortices from the outset : @xmath156 the @xmath157 term has been chosen to allow @xmath158 phase slips but not @xmath57 phase slips , hence `` confining '' single - strength vortices .",
    "further , we have made the apparently arbitrary choice of dividing the superconducting pair - field phase amongst neighboring sites .",
    "while this may seem unnatural , provided the continuum d - wave quasiparticle hamiltonian is an adequate low - energy description , _ any _ lattice regularization should reproduce identical low - wavelength behavior . finally , we have included a `` charging energy '' term coupling to the total ( cooper pair + quasiparticle ) charge .",
    "this model has particle - hole symmetry , and at zero chemical potential is thus automatically at half - filling . to determine the properties of the system , we begin by performing the lattice analog of eq .  [ nodondef ] : @xmath159 .",
    "simultaneously , to avoid non - trivial commutation relations between @xmath160 and @xmath161 , we let @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the @xmath55 fermion creates neutral , spin-@xmath24 quanta . in these variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath164 , with @xmath165 note that the nodon - phase coupling has been transferred from the pair - field interaction to the kinetic term by the operator transformation .",
    "an insulating state is obtained in the limit @xmath166 , where the charging energy dominates over both pair and single - particle hopping .",
    "this state can be studied perturbatively in @xmath167 and @xmath168 , expanding around the insulating state with @xmath169 _ exactly _ on each site . at @xmath170",
    ", however , the @xmath55-particle hamiltonian is still highly degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy is broken at second - order in @xmath167 and @xmath168 , giving the effective hamiltonian ( obtained , e.g. , by perturbatively integrating out @xmath171 and @xmath172 in a path - integral formulation ) @xmath173 with @xmath174 the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath175 is identical to the mean - field hamiltonian for d - wave quasiparticles , with a renormalized bandwidth @xmath176 .",
    "it therefore describes two sets of spin-@xmath24 dirac fermions at low energies .",
    "one thus recovers in this way the nl phase obtained previously via continuum duality .",
    "the interaction @xmath177 can be rewritten as a combination of antiferromagnetic exchange and contact repulsion of the @xmath55-particles . if both are weak ( as in the large @xmath178 limit ) , such four - fermion interactions are strongly irrelevant around the non - interacting nl fixed point , due to the linearly vanishing density of states of the dirac fermions .",
    "a slightly refined analysis including a physical external gauge field @xmath179 allows one to calculate explicitly the conductivity and show that the @xmath55-fermions carry no current in the nl state , so it is indeed an insulator@xcite .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , @xmath3-flux vortex condensation atop the d - wave superconductor yields the nl , an insulator with charge quantization ( charge @xmath28 per unit cell ) appropriate near the half - filled mott insulator . unlike the cdw obtained by @xmath2-flux vortex condensation or the conventional ( fully gapped `` short - range rvb '' ) spin liquid state,@xcite  the nl also contains low - lying gapless spin degrees of freedom , the nodons , which contain the germ of true antiferromagnetic order . as described in ref .",
    ", the phenomenology described above can be easily extended to include nel order .",
    "the description to this point has essentially neglected inter - nodon interactions .",
    "this approach is justified provided such interactions are weak , as all such terms are perturbatively irrelevant ( in the renormalization group sense ) in the dirac theory describing the nl.@xcite  however , perturbative irrelevance does not imply that _ strong _ interactions can not drive quantum phase transitions and hence a qualitative change in behavior .",
    "indeed , interacting dirac fermion models are known to undergo _ chiral symmetry breaking _ transitions as quartic couplings are increased.@xcite  the nature of the transition incurred depends upon the precise nature of the interactions , and various circumstances can induce antiferromagnetism , spin - peierls , charge density wave , and other types of ordering from the nl lagrangian .",
    "indeed , in the lattice model above we obtained an interaction ( eq .",
    "[ eq : he1 ] ) capable of driving a transition to an antiferromagnetic state if sufficiently large .    because of the uncertainties and pitfalls of attempting a microscopic justification of such interactions , however , we prefer to follow the strategy of ref .  and",
    "take a more phenomenological approach . for simplicity",
    "let us focus on the case of half - filling with particle / hole symmetry .",
    "since the cuprate materials are clearly antiferromagnetically ordered , we will _ assume _ the existence of a triplet collective mode with momentum @xmath180 .",
    "in the nl phase this magnon mode has a gap , and indeed we expect also a non - zero lifetime , as the triplet magnons can decay into pairs of nodons , so strictly speaking the magnons are not sharply defined elementary excitations in this case .",
    "nevertheless , we may imagine tuning a parameter ( e.g. reducing frustrating spin - spin interactions in a lattice model ) to reduce the magnon gap .",
    "ultimately when it vanishes the collective mode becomes sharp and condenses to form an antiferromagnetically ordered state . in the antiferromagnetic state ,",
    "the non - zero nel vector coherently mixes nodons with opposite quasi - momentum and opposite spin , halving the magnetic brillouin zone as is usual in spin - density - wave systems . as in those more conventional cases ,",
    "this has the effect of opening up a gap in the nodon spectrum .",
    "@xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the dirac `` velocities '' perpendicular and parallel to the putative fermi surface , @xmath184 is the momentum measured from a node , @xmath185 is the mean - field staggered magnetization , and @xmath186 is a phenomenological coupling constant . due to this mixing ,",
    "the only gapless degrees of freedom in the antiferromagnet are the collective spin - wave modes guaranteed by goldstone s theorem .    in this way",
    "we arrive at an effective low - energy field theory for an antiferromagnetic mott insulator , which we will denote ( for reasons which will become apparent ) as an af * phase . the antiferromagnetic spin order , featureless incompressible charge configuration , and gapless spin waves are qualitatively identical to those we would obtain in more conventional antiferromagnetic models , e.g. the nested spin - density - wave in the weakly - interacting half - filled hubbard model , or alternatively the @xmath187-like very large @xmath178 limit of the same hamiltonian .",
    "we stress , however , that although the nodons have been lifted away from zero energy , they are not confined by the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the af * phase , i.e. spin-@xmath24 neutral particles still exist as well - defined elementary excitations . for this reason",
    ", we believe that such a novel antiferromagnetic insulator ( af * ) is topologically distinct from ( i.e. can not be adiabatically deformed into ) a more conventional antiferromagnetic ( af ) state .",
    "this conviction is bolstered by the existence of the dual order parameter @xmath152 , which we have argued characterizes the nodal liquid and the af * phase . since @xmath152 creates @xmath3 vortices in a _ pair _",
    "field , the af * phase contains the germ of superconductivity .",
    "in contrast , construction of a dual order parameter for the conventional antiferromagnet probably requires the use of chern - simons ( charge @xmath28 ) bosons , obtained directly by statistical transmutation from the electrons .",
    "for example , condensing elementary @xmath3 vortices in the spin - up boson to form a charge @xmath28 crystal which lives on one sub - lattice , and similarly freezing the spin down particles onto the other sub - lattice , should suffice to describe the hidden order of the af phase .",
    "evidently , the dual order parameters in af and af * are very different . alternatively",
    ", one can distinguish af * and af by testing for the presence or absence of spin - charge separation employing the argument in section ii . to make the argument precise in this case",

    "but it is of more interest to address whether the af and af * phases can be distinguished _ experimentally _ ? to address this , we turn to a discussion of the electron spectral function in these two phases .      in standard many - body systems ,",
    "the existence of well - defined excitations is ascertained by examination of the relevant spectral function.@xciteunfortunately , a direct probe of spin - charge separation via spectral functions is not possible , since there are no local operators which separately create nodons and holons . on the other hand ,",

    "the @xmath189 in the af and af * phases are thus not qualitatively different , and can not strictly speaking be used to distinguish the phases .",
    "quantitatively , however , we expect the af * spectral function to exhibit a very small `` quasiparticle '' peak , with minimal separation from a nodon - spinon continuum carrying most of the spectral weight .",
    "if we assume that the holon gap greatly exceeds the gap for the nodons , then both features are expected to disperse in approximately d - wave fashion , though the cusp for angles near @xmath272 should be rounded by the nodon gap ( eq .  [ eq : nodongap ] ) . at non - zero temperatures ,",
    "thermally excited particles will scatter the injected electron and lead to broadening of even the threshold peak . in the af * case , where this feature is expected to lie close to the nodon - holon continuum and have small weight , such thermal broadening could well remove the quasiparticle peak completely at experimental temperatures .    for a system at half - filling but without particle - hole symmetry ,",
    "the neel ordering wavevector is not commensurate with the spacing between antipodal nodes . if this incommensurability is sufficiently large , it is possible for the nodons to remain gapless even in the presence of long - range antiferromagnetic order . in this unusual state , which we denote as af / nl , gapless spin @xmath24 nodons co - exist with the spin @xmath273 magnons .",
    "since the density of states for the gapless nodons vanishes linearly with energy , a weak interaction with the massive holons is _ not _ expected to result in a holon - nodon bound state .",
    "angle resolved photo - emission in the af / nl phase will thus have a number of notable features . specifically , since the electron will decay into the nodon - holon continuum , one does not expect _ any _ sharp features in the momentum resolved spectral function .",
    "the lowest energy spectral weight is expected at the nodes , with a threshold energy which disperses linearly away from the nodes as in the d - wave superconductor .",
    "the spectral weight should rise smoothly above threshold due to the nodon - holon continuum - with no delta function peaks .",
    "this behavior is in fact reminiscent of that observed in the undoped ca compound by shen et .",
    "al.,@xciteand is in marked contrast to the delta - function spectral features expected in a conventional antiferromagnetic .",
    "a small number of examples of condensed matter systems are generally agreed to exhibit exotic quantum numbers , i.e. particles which seem to require `` splitting '' the electron .",
    "both charge fractionalization@xcite and spin - charge separation are generic in one dimension@xcite . in the two - dimensional quantum hall effect , fractionally charged particles have been known to exist for some time,@xcite  and recently have been observed in dramatic shot - noise experiments.@xcitein both these examples , fractional charge is connected to topological excitations : solitons or domain walls in one dimension and vortices in two dimensions .    a third example ,",
    "less widely appreciated , is a superconductor in _ any _",
    "dimension.@xcite   for the superconductor the mechanism is different : _ pairing _ of electrons into singlets creates a gapless collective ( second ) sound mode that carries the charge .",
    "the sound mode can adjust almost instantaneously to a quasiparticle , effectively neutralizing it , leaving only a bare spin-@xmath24 .",
    "on the face of it this species of spin - charge separation appears considerably different from the other topological varieties .",
    "= 3.5 in [ pdfig ]    in this paper we have exploited a dual formulation to show that indeed isolated charges ( `` holons '' ) derived from the superconductor can be understood as topological excitations in a vortex condensate .",
    "further , we have described how spin - charge separation can occur in an insulating state which results from the quantum disordering of a superconductor .",
    "of course , propinquity to the superconducting state does nt guarantee the inheritance of spin - charge separation : it only occurs when flux @xmath3 vortices condense .",
    "the most interesting example of this phenomenon  from the point of view of high-@xmath274 phenomenology  is the nodal liquid , which we have discussed from this standpoint .",
    "the condensation of @xmath2 vortices , on the other hand , leads to the confinement of spin and charge .",
    "the band insulator and the cdw , for example , can be understood in this way .",
    "one striking consequence of the distinction between spin - charge separated and confined systems is that there are two distinct antiferromagnetic states : one , af , which is the ordinary antiferromagnet and another , af * , which is spin - charge separated .",
    "the latter results from ordering the nodons in a nodal liquid , so it has neutral , spin @xmath24 excitations .",
    "however , the distinction between the af and af * phases is experimentally rather elusive .",
    "the natural place to look is the electron spectral function , which can be probed through angle - resolved photo - emission experiments . under some conditions ( see sec .",
    "ivb ) , the unconventional antiferromagnet should exhibit _ only _ a nodon - holon continuum instead of a quasiparticle pole .",
    "unfortunately , the existence of nodon - holon bound states makes the distinction between the af and af * phases rather subtle . on the other hand , according to the paradigm presented here , spin - charge separation is a consequence of @xmath3 vortex condensation .",
    "thus , spin - charge separation could be indirectly evidenced by the observation of @xmath3 vortices near the quantum critical point at which superconductivity is destroyed .    the continuity of spin - charge separation that is embodied in the nodal liquid and its offspring af * state makes possible a simple phenomenological description of the evolution from the insulator to the superconductor , as espoused in ref .  .",
    "for example , the simplest ginzburg - landau formulation predicts the phase diagrams in fig .  2 .",
    "if , on the other hand , spin - charge separation is _ absent _ in the undoped insulator , there must be a confinement transition between @xmath275 and the superconductor .",
    "while we have argued that such a transition is driven by @xmath2 vortices , its nature and the phases which it connects are highly non - trivial .",
    "the relative simplicity and elegance of the nodal liquid scenario thus argues in favor of its relevance to the cuprates . despite numerous and interesting differences among different compounds , the phase diagrams of high - temperature superconductors enjoy a remarkable degree of universality .",
    "a number of theoretical works have attempted to understand the commonalities and variations amongst the topology of these phase diagrams phenomenologically.@xcite  at low temperatures , however , we believe classical phenomenology based only on conventional order parameters misses the important physics of gapless quasiparticles and spin - charge separation that are key in the vicinity of d - wave superconductor - insulator transitions . _",
    "any _ viable theory of the cuprates must at least address the issue of how spin and charge either remain separated or become confined on approaching the insulator .",
    "in addition to the search for a ` smoking gun ' experiment for spin - charge separation , there are a number of other interesting questions raised by this work .",
    "how do we implement the interaction between nodons and @xmath2 vortices in an @xmath276-invariant way ? how do these formulations of spin - charge separation apply to @xmath277 systems ?",
    "we are grateful to eugene demler , eduardo fradkin , steve girvin , courtney lannert , subir sachdev , doug scalapino and anirvan sengupta for clarifying discussions .",
    "we would particularly like to thank bert halperin for his insight on the importance of gapped spin - charge separated excitations as a means to distinguish quantum phases .",
