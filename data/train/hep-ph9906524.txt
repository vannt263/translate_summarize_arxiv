    "recent measurements @xcite have established the asymmetry in the distributions of up and down quarks in the nucleon sea , a result which can not be understood in terms of perturbative qcd .",
    "the presence of pions in the nucleon can naturally account for the excess of @xmath8 over @xmath9 .",
    "the role of mesons in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) was first investigated by sullivan @xcite .",
    "he suggested that some fraction of the nucleon s anti - quark sea distribution may be associated with the pion cloud of the nucleon .",
    "several works developed this idea and gave origin to the meson cloud model ( mcm ) @xcite .",
    "they are all based on the notion that the physical proton ( p ) may be expanded in a sum of virtual meson - baryon ( @xmath10 ) states .",
    "the probabilities of these states are not known apriori .",
    "they are commonly related to the probability of the splitting @xmath11 , which , in turn , is calculated with a simple feynman diagramm of meson emission . in these calculations",
    "the assumption is made that the proton is already an extended object and a form factor is assigned to the meson emission vertex .",
    "this form factor contains a cut - off parameter which must be adjusted by fitting experimental data . in some works",
    "it is adjusted to correctly reproduce the gottfried sum rule ( gsr ) violation .",
    "the most consistent procedure , however , is to fix the cut - off by simultaneously analyzing data on hadronic collisions and parton distribution functions .",
    "this is the atitude adopted , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the cut - off choices vary over a wide range according to the experimental source used in the determination procedure . in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed discussion of the subject is presented .    in a very recent analysis of the e866 data @xcite",
    ", the authors used the mcm to fit the @xmath12 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the dominant intermediate @xmath10 states are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the conclusion was that the cut - off associated with both states must be soft and also @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , with dipole form factor @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath16 .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in @xcite . with such choices it was possible to find `` nearly exact accord '' with experiment .",
    "this finding on one hand increases the confidence in the virtual meson - baryon picture but on the other hand imposes constraints on the mcm description of other high energy collision data . in many previous studies @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 were assumed to be roughly equal @xcite . shortly after the e866 analysis , melnitchouk , speth and thomas @xcite presented a new calculation of the @xmath20 asymmetry in the framework of the mcm , including @xmath4 and @xmath5 states and also pauli exclusion principle effects .",
    "their conclusion was that data can be reproduced with a dipole form factor if @xmath21 @xmath16 and @xmath22 @xmath16 .    in this work",
    "we address inclusive meson production at high energy proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "we concentrate on low @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and large @xmath0 ( @xmath25 ) where non - perturbative effects are dominant and the meson cloud is most relevant .",
    "more specifically we address the @xmath0 distributions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 produced in @xmath28 and @xmath29 collisions at @xmath30 .",
    "we present simultaneously a fit of the meson inclusive spectra and the analysis of the gsr including the recently measured @xmath31 distribution .",

    "assuming that in proton - proton collisions the proton behaves like a meson ( @xmath32 ) - baryon ( @xmath33 ) state , the possible reaction mechanisms for meson production at large @xmath0 and small @xmath23 are illustrated in fig .",

    "1c the meson in the cloud is already a @xmath26 or a @xmath27 which escapes",
    ". we shall refer to the first two processes as `` indirect production '' and to the last one as `` direct production '' .",
    "the first two are calculated with convolution formulas whereas the last one is given basically by the meson momentum distribution in the cloud initial @xmath34 state .",
    "direct production has been widely used in the context of the mcm and applied to study @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 production @xcite .",
    "indirect meson production has been considered previously in a simplified approach @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a process analogous to 1c , in which the baryon escapes was used to determine various cut - off parameters .",
    "the authors found values around @xmath38 for all of them .",
    "however the agreement between theory and experiment was poor .",
    "this suggests that the no - rescattering assumption is not appropriate . in @xcite the same type of process",
    "was considered but rescattering of the baryon with the target was included and absorptive corrections were calculated .",
    "this results in a reduction of about @xmath39 of the cross section at almost all values of the baryon fractional momentum ( @xmath40 ) except at @xmath41 where absorptive corrections are not important .",
    "the indirect mechanism has not been applied to baryon production because the sub - process @xmath42 is not experimentally well known . on the other hand we can study inclusive meson production with 1a ) since data on @xmath43 are available .",
    "as stated above , in the mcm the projectile proton is regarded as being a sum of virtual meson - baryon pairs and a proton - proton reaction can thus be viewed as reaction between the `` constituent '' mesons and baryons of one proton with the other proton .",
    "we shall decompose the proton in the following possible fock states : |p > & = & z [ |p_0 > + |p_0 ^0 > + |n ^+ > + |^0",

    "the state @xmath45 was also included but was found to be relevant only for production of large @xmath23 particles .",

    "the quantity @xmath71 is the baryon - proton cross section at cms energy @xmath72 and @xmath73 is an absorption factor .",
    "this cross section is energy ( @xmath74 ) dependent but in the energy range considered here its variation is very small and therefore we take it as a constant @xmath75 @xmath76 .",

    "of course this is a model dependent quantity .",
    "as stated above , the modest agreement of direct production calculations with data obtained in several works and the improvement obtained in @xcite ( with the inclusion of absorption effects ) strongly suggest that this factor is important and we shall keep it .",
    "once the `` splitting functions '' ( [ fpin ] ) and ( [ fpidel ] ) are known we can calculate the part of the antiquark distribution in the proton coming from the pion cloud with the convolution : q ( x)_f = _ x^1 f_m / mb ( y ) q^_f ( ) [ quark ] where @xmath79 is the flavour @xmath80 valence antiquark distribution in the pion . with the above formula we can compute the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions , their difference , @xmath81 , and calculate the gottfried integral : s_g = - _ 0 ^ 1 [ d ( x ) - u(x ) ] dx [ gottfried ]",
    "the invariant cross sections for the reactions @xmath82 and @xmath83 , appearing in the convolutions ( [ dsigmeson ] ) and ( [ dsigbaryon ] ) are listed in table i. those in the first column can be taken directly from experimental data@xcite .",
    "the unmeasured @xmath84 process was approximated by the average between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the same procedure was used for the process @xmath87 .    in making use of experimental cross sections we are treating the virtual mesons in the cloud as real particles . in our case",
    "this can be justified because the observed mesons both on the left hand side of ( [ sechoque ] ) and on the right hand side of ( [ dsigmeson ] ) and of ( [ dsigbaryon ] ) have very small tranverse momentum .",
    "consequently the involved cloud particles must also have small tranverse momentum , being therefore not far from the mass shell .",
    "the reactions in the second and third columns of table i are not measured .",
    "we expect them all to be of the same order of magnitude ( aditive quark model approximation ) .",

    "an extensive discussion concerning the appropriate value of the cut - off has been made , using exponential form factors .",
    "the conclusion of the authors was that , for exponential form factors , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "they find out that allowing the @xmath95 and @xmath96 vertices to be different improves the quality of their fits . on the strange sector ,",

    "@xcite the mcm was used to study baryon ( @xmath35 , @xmath97 and @xmath36 ) spectra in @xmath28 collisions and the resulting fits strongly suggest a universal cut off @xmath98 .",
    "the exponential form factor is , of course , not the only possible choice .",
    "one might use a monopole or dipole form as well .",
    "differences between the various forms are not particularly important and , besides , as it was pointed out by kumano @xcite it is possible to `` translate '' one form factor with its cut - off to another form factor with a correspondingly different cut - off , the overall results being approximately equivalent .",
    "the approximate relation between the exponential ( @xmath99 ) , dipole ( @xmath100 ) and monopole ( @xmath101 ) cut - offs is given by @xmath102 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , in dealing with decuplet splitting functions monopole form factors lead to divergencies . with an exponential form factor one",
    "avoids this problem but the calculations can only be done numerically . using the dipole form factor we can perform the integrations ( [ fpin ] ) and ( [ fpidel ] ) analytically .",
    "because of this advantage we choose the dipole form .",
    "once translated to the monopole form the cut - off values quoted above give values around @xmath103 which are still significantly smaller than old analyses performed with the bonn potential @xcite or the nijmegen @xcite potential which favour a harder cut - off ( @xmath104 ) but are close to values obtained in more recent analyses performed by the same group @xcite .    in view of all the works done so far on this subject",
    ", we may conclude that these cut - off parameters must be soft .",
    "the next question which is now under debate is : which cut - off is larger , @xmath105 or @xmath106 ? as pointed out in the introduction , the e866 analysis @xcite favours @xmath107 whereas melnitchouk , speth and thomas @xcite suggest that @xmath108",

    "because of eq.([fmb ] ) all these figures are symmetric and the meson momentum distributions ( always on the left part of each box ) are the `` mirror '' pictures of the corresponding baryon momentum distributions ( always on the right part of each box ) .",
    "the comparison between the upper pannels with the lower ones shows that at soft cut - off s there is a more distinct separation between baryons and mesons , the former peaking at higher values of @xmath53 and the latter at smaller @xmath53 s . at harder",

    "we see that the direct process dominates pion production up to @xmath132 . in the two lower figures ( harder cut - off parameters ) they are so important for all @xmath0 that one can neglect the @xmath32 and @xmath33 contributions . for soft cut - off choices",
    "the @xmath33 component becomes important too and even dominant at @xmath133 ( shaded area in figs .",

    "comparing the two shaded areas , we observe that with @xmath108 ( on the right ) the @xmath33 component starts earlier to dominate the pion @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "this component is the harder and flatter one and is essential to obtain a good description of data at large @xmath0 .",
    "the direct contribution alone would fall too fast and underestimate data . neglecting the direct contribution leads to a good fit only with the @xmath32 and @xmath33 components but at the expense of unrealist large ( dipole ) cut off choices : @xmath134 @xmath16 and @xmath135 @xmath16 . only with these large numbers",
    "we recover the normalization of the experimental spectrum .",
    "neglecting also the @xmath33 component leads to a good fit with the @xmath32 component alone and a cut - off @xmath136 @xmath16 . in short ,",
    "it is clear that we need all three components to describe data , the first one ( @xmath130 ) to get the proper normalization and the last two ( @xmath33 and @xmath32 ) to get the correct shape of the meson spectra . in this way we get also reasonable pion ( and also kaon ) multiplicities . for both cases ( i and ii ) we obtain @xmath137 , which is small enough to justify the use of the one- meson truncation of the fock decomposition .    in fig . 4a and",

    "the value reported by the nmc collaboration is @xmath146 .",
    "taken together , figs . 4 and 5 and the integral @xmath147 , it seems that choice i is better everywhere but fails badly in the @xmath148 ratio .",
    "choice ii , on the other hand , is never far from data points but gives a too large value for @xmath147 .",
