    "gro j1744 - 28 , a 2.1 hz x - ray pulsar with unusual bursting properties , was discovered on 2 december 1995 in the direction of the galactic center with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton  gamma  ray  observatory _",

    "the source initially bursted about every 3 minutes , then declined in frequency to about 30 per day for the first month , after which it increased in frequency to about 40 per day in the period 8 - 18 january 1996 ( fishman et al . 1996 ) .",

    ", we show that the observations are best explained by a neutron star accreting matter through roche lobe overflow from an evolved low - mass stellar companion .",
    "we derive values for the magnetic field stength and accretion luminosity by noting that the beat frequency model ( alpar & shaham 1985 ) for qpos and the accretion - torque model ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) for the pulsar spin - up rate separately imply relations between these two quantities .",
    "the size and temperature of the polar - cap hot spot are determined .",
    "the observed pulse fraction is used to constrain the orientation and geometry of the neutron star , and to derive the distance to the system from the calculated luminosity .",

    "such sizes greatly exceed the radii of main sequence stars with masses @xmath22 , which we also plot in figure 1 ( e.g. , mihalas & binney 1982 ) .",
    "accretion via roche lobe overflow can occur however if the companion star has evolved off the main sequence , which is possible within the lifetime of the galaxy for stars with initial masses @xmath28 .",
    "a companion with a current mass @xmath29 requires that the system be nearly face - on , with @xmath14 , but mass transfer to the neutron star could have decreased the companion s present mass even if its initial mass was @xmath30 .",
    "the evolved companion star must presently have a radius @xmath31 .",
    "the radii of evolved low - mass stars depend mainly on their helium core masses ( webbink , rappaport , & savonije 1983 ) .",
    "we can use the relations of webbink et al .",
    "( 1983 ) to place a lower limit on the present mass of the companion by requiring it to be larger than the helium core mass . in the inset to figure 1 , we plot the stellar radius of an evolved companion versus its helium core mass as well as the roche lobe radius versus stellar mass .",
    "we find that the smallest helium core mass which allows for roche - lobe overflow in gro j1744 - 28 is @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath33 and therefore @xmath34 .",
    "the chance probablity for viewing the system with this inclination is 1 in @xmath3520 . also shown in figure 1 is the no - eclipse condition assuming that @xmath36 .",
    "this restricts @xmath37 , which is less constraining than the above considerations .",
    "the alfvn radius for spherical accretion , obtained by balancing accretion and magnetic pressure , is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the pulsar luminosity in units of @xmath40 , @xmath41 g-@xmath42 is the neutron star magnetic moment ( @xmath43 is the surface equatorial field strength ) , and @xmath44 cm is the neutron star radius .",

    "the requirement that @xmath49 for acretion to take place yields @xmath50 . requiring magnetic confinement of the hot plasma in the accretion column sets a lower limit on the surface polar magnetic field strength @xmath51",

    "can be obtained by interpreting the measured qpo frequency using the beat frequency model of alpar & shaham ( 1985 ) , and the pulsar spin - up rate from the ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) accretion - torque model .",
    "zhang et al . ( 1996 ) report a qpo at frequency @xmath1 hz with integrated power ( uncorrected for deadtime ) under the 27 hz fwhm lorentzian equal to 5.6% of the total power .",
    "although the width of this qpo is somewhat larger than those typically measured in low mass x - ray binaries , with fwhm widths @xmath57 the centroid frequencies ( see , e.g. , van der klis 1995 ) , we still assume that @xmath58 can be interpreted as the beat frequency between the keplerian frequency @xmath59 at @xmath60 and the neutron star s rotation frequency @xmath61 ( alpar & shaham 1985 ) .",
    "less significant peaks in the power spectrum are also found at 20 and 60 hz , and we can not exclude that the 40 hz peak is a harmonic of the 20 hz peak but with larger amplitude .",
    "this implies @xmath62 and @xmath63 where we define @xmath64 .",
    "an expression for the period derivative of a disk - fed x - ray pulsar as a function of neutron star properties was derived by ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) . substituting equation ( 5 ) into their equation ( 15 )",
    "gives @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the neutron star moment of inertia in units of @xmath67-@xmath68 , and @xmath69 , proportional to the dimensionless torque function ( see ghosh & lamb 1979 ; wang 1995 ) , is a function of the fastness parameter @xmath70 . for gro j1744 - 28 , @xmath71 , implying @xmath72 . the observed period derivative is @xmath73 ( finger et al .",
    "1996b ) , which could however be different than the value at the epoch 18 - 19 january 1996 when _ rxte _ measured the 40 hz qpo . in terms of the eddington luminosity @xmath74 , we obtain a pulsar luminosity given by @xmath75 substituting equation ( 8) into ( 5 ) , we obtain @xmath76 the derived value for the magnetic field at the neutron star s equator depends only upon quantities intrinsic to the neutron star and details of the accretion process , and is bracketed by our estimates given above .",
    "we suggest a search with _",
    "rxte _ or _",
    "asca _ for cyclotron absorption features with a fundamental energy at @xmath77-@xmath78 kev ; note that a larger field is inferred if one assumes that the 20 hz peak in the power spectrum is the fundamental . the magnetic field given by equation ( 9 ) does not conflict with osse observations , which show no evidence for cyclotron features at @xmath79 kev ( strickman et al .",
    "equation ( 6 ) for the stopping radius yields a size of the polar - cap hot spot if we assume that its area is determined by the footprints of those magnetic field lines that cross the magnetic equator at @xmath80 . for an assumed dipolar magnetic field geometry , @xmath81 constant , where @xmath82 is the magnetic colatitude .",
    "thus for an aligned rotator @xmath83 \\cong 15^\\circ$ ] , although the hot spot size of an oblique rotator could be smaller if the matter does not accrete uniformly onto the polar cap . the hot - spot size and source luminosity from equation",
    "( 8) imply an effective temperature of @xmath84 kev .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the values of 6 and 14 kev for the blackbody temperature and e - folding energy reported by batse ( briggs et al .",
    "1996 ) and _ rxte _ ( swank et al . 1996 ) , respectively .",
    "batse reports a pulse fraction in the persistent emission of 40% in the 25 - 45 kev band ( finger et al .",
    "1996a ) , whereas smaller energy - dependent values are measured with _",
    "rxte _ for the band between 3 and 12 kev ( zhang 1996 ) .",
    "these pulsations are probably due to projection effects of the x - ray hot spots on the rotating neutron star .",
    "figure 2 shows the various orientations and obliquenesses that produce pulse fractions of 20 , 30 , and 40% calculated from a purely geometric model consisting of two identical uniformly - emitting polar caps .",
    "the large luminosities radiated from a small area may produce a fan - beam radiation pattern , but are not considered here .",
    "we include shadowing effects from the neutron star but not from the accretion column .",
    "a large range of angles are permitted for a given pulse fraction . during the bursting episodes , the flux increases by a factor of 2 - 8 whereas the spectrum remains nearly identical ( a relative excess below 3 - 4 kev is seen during outbursts by _ rxte _ ; zhang 1996 ) . interpreting the increase in flux as due to an increase in emitting area",
    ", we predict that the pulse fraction should decrease by an amount dependent on @xmath85 ( see inset to figure 2 ) . the energy - dependence of the pulse fraction could be a consequence of thermal stratification , with the hotter inner regions therefore showing a larger pulse fraction .    the 2 - 100 kev energy flux reported by",
    "_ rxte _ at epoch 18 - 19",
    "january 1996 ( swank et al . 1996 ) is @xmath86 ergs @xmath87 s@xmath88 for the persistent emission .",
    "the luminosity from equation ( 8) then implies a distance to gro j1744 - 28 of @xmath89 where the geometric factor @xmath90 depends on neutron - star parameters . by approximating the x - ray hot spot as a flat disk",
    ", we find @xmath91 in the limit @xmath92 where neutron shadowing effects are unimportant . for 2 - 3 magnitudes of extinction per kpc in the direction of the galactic center",
    ", we estimate that the brightest optical counterpart would be at @xmath93 for an m0 iii giant ( @xmath940.4 ) .",
    "gro j1744 - 28 shows characteristics of both x - ray bursters and x - ray pulsars .",
    "its intermediate magnetic field strength between the weak fields ( @xmath95 g ) thought to reside in low - mass x - ray binaries and the strong fields ( @xmath96 g ) found in x - ray pulsars suggests that its burst properties are related to those of x - ray bursters .",
    "but the relative fluences in the burst and persistent emissions probably rule out a thermonuclear origin in the initial bursting phase ( kouveliotou et al . 1996a ; strickman et al .",
    "1996 ) , although the energetics derived from _",
    "rxte _ observations ( swank et al . 1996 ) are favorable to such an interpretation .",
    "an accretion - disk instability seems implied by the similarity of the spectral shapes of the burst and persistent emission , since approximately equal energy per particle will be dissipated for an accretion - powered burst .",
    "we also note the similarities of the burst precursor and post - burst recovery period between the bursts from gro j1744 - 28 and the type ii bursts of the rapid burster ( compare dotani et al .",
    "1990 ; lubin et al .",
    "1992 ) , the latter of which are thought to be due to accretion instabilities .",
    "the beat - frequency model implies a testable relation between the persistent luminosity and the qpo centroid frequency given by equation ( 8) .",
    "the inferred persistent luminosity implies a super - eddington flux for the bursting episodes , since the burst flux is @xmath97 times as great as the persistent emission ( swank et al .",
    "the 3 - 5 minute recovery period following a burst observed by _ rxte _ could be due to radiation effects on the disk .",
    "the onset of detectable x - ray emission from this source can not be due to orbital effects as in the case of be x - ray binaries ( the system is nearly circular with eccentricity @xmath98 ; finger et al .",
    "we speculate that as the evolved companion expands and overflows its roche lobe , the increased x - ray illumination drives an enhanced fueling episode ( see tavani & london 1993 ) which ceases when the heated atmosphere no longer overflows the roche surface .",
    "the star then contracts to a quiescent phase after which it resumes its slow expansion leading to the onset of another episode of mass transfer and luminous x - ray emission .",
    "further calculations of evolution , accretion , and radiation will be required to yield a more complete understanding of this extraordinary system .",
