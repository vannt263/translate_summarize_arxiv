    "since the original paper by ising @xcite , magnetic models on a lattice have been extensively used over the years to investigate the statistical physics of interacting many - body systems . in particular , many generalizations of the ising model have been proposed . among them , also models with long - range interactions .",
    "the thermodynamics and the dynamics of systems of particles interacting with long - range forces are particularly interesting because display a series of anomalies with respect to systems with short - range interactions@xcite . by long - range interaction",
    "it is usually intended that the modulus of the potential energy decays , at large distance , not faster than the inverse of the distance to the power of the spatial dimension .",
    "the main reason of the observed anomalies is that systems with long - range forces in general violate _",
    "extensivity _ and _ additivity _ , two basic properties to derive the thermodynamics of a system .",
    "extensivity means that the thermodynamic potentials scale with the system size , i.e. that the specific thermodynamic potentials ( the thermodynamic potentials per particle ) do not diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "additivity means that if we divide the system into two macroscopic parts , the thermodynamic potentials of the whole system are , in the thermodynamic limit , the sum of those of the two components .",
    "though extensivity can be artificially restored by an ad - hoc introduction of a n - dependent coupling constant ( the so called kac s prescription @xcite ) in the interaction , the problem of non - additivity is still present @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of long - range magnetic systems on lattices can give insights on the statistical properties of long - range potentials , and is therefore useful to investigate the statistical mechanics and the dynamics of such systems .",
    "in this paper we study the @xmath0 model , a model of planar spins on a d - dimensional lattice with couplings that decay as the inverse of the distances between spins raised to the power @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath2 additivity does not hold and the system shows a series of anomalies .",
    "even ensemble equivalence , whose proof is based on the possibility of separating the energy of a subsystem from that of the whole , might not be guaranteed in that limit .",
    "in particular we focus on @xmath3 .",
    "in such a case the model reduces to a mean field model@xcite , since a spin interacts equally with all the others independently of their position on the lattice .",
    "this case is extremely important since it has been proved that all the cases with @xmath4 @xcite can be reduced to it .",
    "moreover the dynamical behavior of the model with @xmath3 is also a representative example of other nonextensive systems @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the equilibrium phase and the dynamical anomalies found in an energy region before the second - order critical point when one studies the relaxation towards equilibrium .",
    "the connections with tsallis generalized thermodynamics @xcite and with glassy systems@xcite will be also addressed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model in section 2 , the equilibrium thermodynamics is presented in section 3 , while the anomalous dynamical behavior and its possible theoretical interpretation is discussed in section 4 .",
    "conclusions and future prespectives are presented in section 5 .",
    "the @xmath5 model has been introduced in @xcite and describes a system of classical bidimensional spins ( xy spins ) with mass @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 spins are placed at the sites of a generic @xmath2-dimensional lattice , and each one is represented by the conjugate canonical pair @xmath10 , where the @xmath11 s are the momenta and the @xmath12 s @xmath13 are the angles of rotation on a family of parallel planes , each one defined at each lattice point .",
    "the interaction between rotators @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays as the inverse of their distance @xmath16 to the power @xmath17 .",
    "such hamiltonian is extensive if the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) @xmath18 of the canonical partition function @xmath19 exists and is finite .",
    "this is assured for each @xmath1 by the presence of the rescaling factor @xmath20 in front of the double sum of the potential energy .",
    "@xmath20 is a function of the lattice parameters @xmath21 which is proportional to the range @xmath22 of the interaction defined by @xcite : @xmath23 the sum is independent of the origin @xmath14 because of periodic conditions .",
    "then , for each @xmath1 , @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath25 , which we call here the _ short - range _ case , @xmath22 is finite in the tl @xcite , and things go as if each rotator interacted with a finite number of rotators , those within range @xmath22 . on the contrary when @xmath26 , which we consequently call the _ long - range _ case , @xmath22 diverges in the tl and the factor @xmath27 in ( [ hmfalpha ] ) compensates for this .",
    "+ in fig.1 we report temperature and magnetization vs the energy density .",
    "the full curves are the exact results obtained in the canonical ensemble , the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium .",
    "the numerical simulations ( symbols ) were performed at fixed total energy ( _ microcanonical _ molecular dynamics ) by starting the system close to the equilibrium , i.e. with an initial gaussian distribution of angles and velocities , and reproduce the theoretical curves .",
    "this is already true for small system sizes as @xmath78 , apart from some finite size effects in the homogeneous phase @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the next section the scenario is very different when the system is started with strong out - of - equilibrium initial conditions : in such a case the dynamics does have difficulties in reaching the bg equilibrium and shows a series of anomalies .",
    "the dynamics of each particle obeys the following pendulum equation of motion : @xmath79 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 have a non trivial time dependence , related to the motion of all the other particles in the system .",
    "equations  ( [ pend ] ) can be integrated numerically , see for example refs . @xcite for technical details . in this section",
    "we show that , in an energy range from @xmath80 up to @xmath81 , when the system is started with strong out - of - equilibrium initial conditions , the model has a non trivial dynamical relaxation to the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium .",
    "the class of out - of - equilibrium initial conditions we consider , called _ water bag _ initial conditions , consists in @xmath82 and the momenta uniformly distributed ( according to the total energy density @xmath83 ) . in fig.2 we report , for u=0.69 and n=500 , the time evolution of @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 denotes the time averaged kinetic energy ) , a quantity that coincides with the temperature t. as expected , the system does not relax immediately to the bg equilibrium , but rapidly reaches a quasi - stationary state ( qss ) corresponding to a temperature plateau situated below the canonical prediction ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the t vs u plot ( caloric curve ) , shown in inset ( c ) for the qss regime , confirms a large disagreement with the equilibrium prediction ( inset d ) .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the system remains trapped in such a state for a time that diverges with the size @xmath9 of the system @xcite .",
    "this means that , if the thermodynamic limit is performed before the infinite - time limit , the qss become stable and the system never relax to the bg equilibrium , exhibiting different equilibrium properties characterized by non - gaussian velocity distributions ( see inset a ) @xcite .",
    "such velocity distributions have been fitted in ref.@xcite and have been shown to be in agreement with the prediction of the tsallis generalized thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the latter is a theoretical formalism well suited to describe all those situations where long - range correlations , weak mixing and fractal structures in phase space are present @xcite , such as for example excited plasmas @xcite , turbulent fluids @xcite , maps at the edge of chaos @xcite , high energy nuclear reactions @xcite and cosmic rays fluxes@xcite .",
    "+ the characteristics of the qss have been studied in several papers : vanishing lyapunov spectrum @xcite , negative microcanonical specific heat@xcite , dynamical correlations in phase - space @xcite , lvy walks and anomalous diffusion@xcite .",
    "recently also the validity of the zeroth principle of thermodynamics has been numerically demonstrated for these metastable states@xcite .",
    "+ in the following of this paper we focus on the study of anomalous diffusion , long - range correlations and the spin - glass phase .",
    "the link between relaxation to the bg equilibrium , and anomalous diffusion was studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "notice that diffusion starts around @xmath102 when particles start to be evaporated from the main cluster @xcite .",
    "this result can be interpreted in the following way . when started with water - bag initial condition ( @xmath103 )",
    "the system immediately decays into the qss plateau with @xmath104 . in fig.2",
    "this initial part is not shown .",
    "then a very slow microscopic relaxation occurs since the force exerted on each single spin / particle is almost zero @xcite . during the slow relaxation process ,",
    "many small rotating clusters on the unitary circle are continuosly formed and compete each other by trapping the particles in order to reach a configuration compatible with the final bg equilibrium state .",
    "thus , particles remains trapped for a while in the clusters , until they finally succeed to escape again and so on . trapping times and escape times obey power - law decays with characteristic exponents that allow to relate anomalous diffusion with lvy walks .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "such a mechanism of trappings and lvy walks disappears when the system finally reaches equilibrium since at that time only one large cluster is present ( the system is below the critical point in the ferromagnetic phase ) .",
    "anomalous diffusion can be obtained within a generalized fokker - planck equation which generates tsallis distributions with an entropic index @xmath105 , see refs.@xcite .",
    "one can extract the following relationship between the exponent @xmath106 which characterizes anomalous diffusion and the entropic index @xmath105 of tsallis thermostatistics @xmath107 considering the value of @xmath108 observed in our case , we would expect then a value of the entropic index @xmath109 which should characterize the dynamical anomalies of the hmf model .",
    "actually , this is not the value found in ref.@xcite for the velocity pdfs , where we obtained only an effective entropic index .",
    "however this value is in good agreement to what has been found for the decay of the velocity correlation functions which will be examined in the next section .",
    "the global effects of the competition between magnetic clusters discussed in the previous subsection prevents the system from exploring all the available phase space .",
    "thus one observes a sort of _ dynamical frustration _ which suggests also an interesting connection with the _ weak - ergodicity breaking _",
    "scenario typical of glassy systems .",
    "such a scenario , introduced by bouchaud et al .",
    "@xcite , generally occurs when the phase - space of the system we consider is not _ a - priori _ broken into mutually inaccessible regions , but the system remains confined only into a restricted part of it : consequentely one finds slowly decaying correlation functions and aging , i.e. the presence of strong memory effects that depend on the history of the system .",
    "this is just what happens in the hmf model .",
    "+ the velocity autocorrelation functions in the qss regime have been studied in ref@xcite . in its simplest form",
    "the autocorrelation function of the particles velocity can be written as @xcite @xmath110 if we want to take into account several dynamical realizations ( events ) in order to obtain better averaged quantities , it is possible to use the following alternative definition of the autocorrelation function @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the n - component velocity vector and the brackets @xmath113 indicate the average over different events , while @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the standard deviations at time @xmath38 and at the initial time .",
    "such a function has been numerically evaluated @xcite in the qss region .",
    "the results are shown in fig.4 for the case @xmath100 and @xmath116 : a power - law tail is observed , this being a signature of long - range correlations .      to study the aging phenomenon we need to evaluate a two points correlation function : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the waiting time .",
    "this function has been evaluated in ref.@xcite . in the qss region ,",
    "one finds a strong dependence on the waiting time @xmath125 see fig.5 ( a ) for the case @xmath100 and @xmath116 .",
    "the curves obey a precise scaling as that one observed for glasses . rescaling the time of the various correlation curves by @xmath126 with @xmath127",
    ", we get a unique curve with a very interesting power - law tail , see fig.5 ( b ) . also in this case as in the previous figure",
    ", one can reproduce nicely the time evolution of the rescaled correlation function with a q - exponential curve .",
    "the best fit , reported in the figure , was obtained for case @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the q - logarithm is reported in panel ( c ) in order to compare the quality of the fit .",
    "notice that this value of @xmath105 is not very different from the one extracted from the decay of the autocorrelation function ( 22 ) and from that one extracted from the anomalous diffusion . a more detailed investigation in order to deduce analitically",
    "the predicted value of the entropic index from the observed anomalies is in progress .      in the long - range spin - glass models the aging phenomenon below a transition temperature",
    "is associated with the complex energy landscape characteristic of the frustrated models .",
    "the latter is rich of metastable states that play the role of dynamical traps which can confine the system for a long time and cause the observed history - dependent slow relaxation dynamics@xcite .",
    "the parallel with spin - glass systems can be made stronger by the introduction of a new order parameter for the qss plateau , the @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the polarization represents the temporal average ( over a time interval @xmath132 inside the qss plateau ) of the spin vectors , whose modulus is also averaged over the @xmath9 spins , i.e. @xmath133 such an order parameter allows to characterize in a quantitative way the dynamical freezing and frustration of the qss regime by interpreting the latter as a spin - glass phase .",
    "in fact , in analogy with the spin - glass phase of the long - range sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite , we have observed that , in the qss regime and in the thermodynamic limit , the magnetization vanishes as @xmath134 , but the polarization @xmath135 remains constant around a value equal to @xmath136 , see fig.2 of ref .",
    "therefore @xmath135 allows to distinguish between the disorderd qss glassy phase and the high temperature one .",
    "this result is very interesting because , at variance with standard glassy systems , neither disorder nor frustration are present _ a - priori _ in the elementary interactions of the hmf model . on the contrary , they emerge naturally as dynamical features of the model in qss region and , like the other features seen before , disappear when the system reaches finally the bg equilibrium .",
    "the introduction of the polarization order parameter , which connects the qss dynamical frustration with the edwards - anderson order parameter of the sk model , opens a new perspective to understand the true nature of metastability in long - range hamiltonian systems in terms of an emerging glassy behavior .",
    "in this paper we have briefly reviewed the dynamics and thermodynamics of the hamiltonian mean field model .",
    "this is a model that allows to study long - range interactions in many - body hamiltonian systems .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the hmf model can be derived analitically , though the model dynamics presents very interesting anomalies like metastability , superdiffusion , non - gaussian velocity pdfs , long - range correlations , vanishing lyapunov exponents and weak - ergodicity breaking in an energy region below the critical point .",
    "these anomalies are common to many long - range systems .",
    "recently it has been found that such anomalous regime can be characterized as a glassy phase .",
    "therefore the model represents also a very interesting bridge between nonextensive systems and glassy systems and in this respect it will deserve more detailed investigations in the future .",
    "the link with the nonextensive thermostatistics formalism proposed by constantino tsallis is also a very promising and intriguing line of research .",
    "all the anomalies point in that direction and the future years will be crucial in order to establish this connection in a firm and rigorous way as it has recently been done for example in unimodal maps .",
