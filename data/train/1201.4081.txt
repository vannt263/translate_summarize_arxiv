    "random destruction of combinatorial trees is an old topic which can be traced back more than 40 years ago to the work of meir and moon  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a rooted tree on a finite set of vertices .",
    "imagine that we pick a vertex uniformly at random and destroy it together with the entire subtree generated by that vertex .",
    "we iterate in an obvious way until the root is picked and are interested in the number @xmath3 of steps of this algorithm .",
    "the present paper has been motivated by the following result due to janson  @xcite who treated the case where @xmath0 is a large galton  watson tree .",
    "more precisely , consider the genealogical tree of a branching process having a critical reproduction law with finite variance @xmath4 , and let @xmath5 be a version of this tree conditioned to have exactly @xmath1 vertices , assuming implicitly that the probability of that event is positive .",
    "then janson established that @xmath6 converges weakly as @xmath2 to the rayleigh distribution which has density @xmath7 on @xmath8 .",
    "see also panholzer  @xcite for the same result in a less general setting , and abraham and delmas  @xcite for a recent contribution and further references .",
    "the following extension has been recently obtained in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be a uniform cayley tree with @xmath1 vertices ; it is well known that this corresponds to a special case of conditioned galton  watson trees , namely , when the reproduction law is poisson . given @xmath9 ,",
    "distinguish @xmath10 vertices uniformly at random , where @xmath10 is some fixed integer .",
    "then remove an edge uniformly at random and independently of the distinguished vertices .",
    "this disconnects @xmath9 into two subtrees .",
    "if one of these subtrees does not contain any of the distinguished vertices , then we destroy it entirely , else we keep the two subtrees .",
    "we iterate until each and every distinguished vertex has been isolated and denote by @xmath11 the number of steps .",
    "then , according to lemma 1 in  @xcite , @xmath12 converges weakly as @xmath2 to the chi distribution with parameter @xmath13 , which has density @xmath14 on @xmath8 .",
    "this result has also been very recently recovered by  @xcite using a different approach .",
    "the chi@xmath15 distribution occurs as the law of the length @xmath16 of a brownian continuum random tree ( crt ) @xmath17 reduced to @xmath10 leaves picked uniformly at random , as can be seen from aldous @xcite , lemma 21 .",
    "the appearance of the brownian crt in this framework should not come as a surprise since it is well known that if we assign length @xmath18 to each edge of @xmath9 , then the latter converges weakly to a brownian crt @xmath17 as @xmath2 .",
    "we stress , however , that the rescaled cayley tree @xmath19 and @xmath20 _ do not _",
    "converge jointly in distribution toward @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "the proof in  @xcite of the extension above of janson s result relies on three crucial features .",
    "first , the observation due to pitman @xcite that random deletion of edges in a uniform cayley tree yields a remarkable fragmentation process ; second , a general limit theorem due to haas and miermont  @xcite for so - called branching markov trees ; third , the characterization of the brownian fragmentation in  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the fragmentation process that results from the repeated deletion of edges in a uniform cayley tree can be represented by a markov branching tree whose law is explicitly known . in this",
    "setting , @xmath22 corresponds to the length of this markov branching tree reduced to @xmath10 leaves picked uniformly at random .",
    "thanks to the limit theorem of haas and miermont , one then checks that this markov branching tree with lengths rescaled by a factor @xmath18 converges weakly , and the limit can then be identified as another brownian crt , say @xmath23 , using the characterization of the fragmentation process at heights induced by the latter . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath24 converges weakly to @xmath25 and hence , to the chi@xmath15 law .",
    "unfortunately , this approach only works for cayley trees ; as for other conditioned galton  watson trees , random edge deletion does not yield , in general , a markov branching tree as above , and the entire structure of the proof collapses . nonetheless , the fact that janson s result is valid for any critical galton ",
    "watson tree with finite variance suggests that the same should also hold for its natural extension to @xmath10 vertices for @xmath26 .",
    "the first purpose of this work is to show that this is indeed the case . for the sake of convenience",
    ", we shall deal with a slightly modified model in which we distinguish edges rather than vertices , and which is easily seen to have the same asymptotic behavior as the former .",
    "the precise framework and result are presented in section [ sec12 ] below .",
    "our main goal , in the spirit of  @xcite , will be to prove a convergence result for the genealogy induced by the edge - deletion procedure , even though this process does not satisfy , in general , the markov branching property of  @xcite . in section  [ sec13 ] , we introduce the cut - tree of a finite tree , which roughly speaking records the genealogy of blocks in the edge - deletion process which consists of removing edges of that tree one after the other and in uniform random order . in section  [ sec14 ] , we define the cut - tree of a brownian crt @xmath17 , relying on a poissonian logging process on the skeleton of @xmath27 which has been constructed by aldous and pitman  @xcite to study the so - called standard additive coalescent .",
    "our main result claims the joint weak convergence of @xmath5 and its cut - tree suitably rescaled toward their continuous counterparts , namely , @xmath17 and @xmath28 ; it is stated in section  [ sec15 ] .",
    "after this long introduction , the rest of this paper will be organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] is devoted to preliminary results that will be used in the proof of theorem  [ t ] , and the latter is established in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to the proof of a technical bound , relying partly on an invariance property under random re - planting for galton  watson trees , which may be of independent interest .",
    "it will be convenient in the sequel to work with a slight modification of the trees under consideration .",
    "consider a ( rooted ) tree @xmath0 on a set of @xmath1 vertices , say @xmath29=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] ; we add a new vertex which we call the _ base _ and link it to the root of @xmath0 by a new edge .",
    "this gives a _ planted _ tree which we denote by @xmath30 .",
    "see figure  [ figplanting ] .",
    "the set @xmath31 of edges of @xmath30 is thus given by the set @xmath32 of edges of @xmath0 plus the new edge connecting the base to the root .",
    "we consider @xmath31 as a set of vertices , and endow it with a natural tree structure by declaring that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are neighbors in @xmath31 if and only if they are adjacent in @xmath30 .",
    "plainly , this yields a tree which is isomorphic to @xmath0 ; more precisely , the map @xmath35 $ ] that associates to an edge @xmath33 of @xmath30 , its extremity @xmath36 $ ] which is the farthest away from the base vertex in @xmath30 , is bijective and preserves the tree structures .",
    "any statement expressed in terms of the edges of @xmath30 can thus be rephrased in terms of the vertices of @xmath0 and vice versa . for a technical reason",
    ", it will be slightly simpler for us to work with the edge - version rather than the vertex - version of conditioned galton ",
    "watson trees .    as before ,",
    "we consider a critical reproduction law @xmath37 with finite variance @xmath4 .",
    "denote by @xmath38 the greatest common divisor of the support of @xmath37 ; and observe that when @xmath1 is a sufficiently large integer , the total population of a galton  watson process with reproduction law @xmath37 generated by a single ancestor equals @xmath1 with positive probability if and only if @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath5 denote a version of a galton  watson tree with reproduction law @xmath37 conditioned to have exactly @xmath1 vertices which are enumerated , for instance , in the breadth - first search order to yield a tree - structure on @xmath29 $ ] as required .",
    "of course , the vertex corresponding to the ancestor serves as the root .",
    "we shall implicitly restrict our attention to the case @xmath39 , so this conditioning makes sense provided that @xmath1 is large enough . recall that the associated planted tree is denoted by @xmath40 and has @xmath1 edges .",
    "next , for every integer @xmath41 , given @xmath40 , we distinguish @xmath10 edges in @xmath40 uniformly at random . conditionally on @xmath40 , we pick an edge uniformly at random and independently of these @xmath10 distinguished edges .",
    "we remove it from @xmath40 ; this disconnects @xmath40 into two subtrees .",
    "we then only consider subtrees that contain at least one of the distinguished edges , discarding , if necessary , those that contain no distinguished edge .",
    "we iterate until each and every distinguished edge has been removed , and write @xmath42 for the number of steps .",
    "we shall prove the following .",
    "[ p1 ] in the notation above , @xmath43 converges in distribution as @xmath2 to the chi distribution with parameter @xmath13 , that is , @xmath44     of a planted tree @xmath45 .",
    "the vertices are labeled in arabic numerals in breadth - first order for this planar representation of @xmath30 , while the order of deletion of the edges is indicated in lowercase roman numerals .",
    "each internal vertex in the tree to the right is naturally labeled by the set of leaves that lie in the subtree above this node . ]",
    "we can be more accurate by keeping track of the genealogy induced by the edge - deletion process depicted above .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath0 be a rooted tree with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath46 its planted version . recall that @xmath46 has @xmath1 edges which are naturally enumerated by the map @xmath47 $ ] described in the preceding section .",
    "then we entirely destroy @xmath45 by inductively removing its edges , uniformly at random one after the other . for @xmath48 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the label of the edge that is removed at the @xmath50th step , so @xmath51 is a uniform random permutation of  @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "we partly encode this edge - deletion process by another tree , which we denote by @xmath52 and construct as follows ( see figure  [ figcut ] ) .",
    "for every @xmath53 , let @xmath54 be the partition of @xmath55 obtained by specifying that two elements @xmath50 and @xmath56 in @xmath57 are in the same block of @xmath54 if and only if either @xmath58 or the edges with labels @xmath50 and @xmath56 are still connected in the forest obtained from @xmath45 by deletion of the @xmath59 first edges with labels @xmath60 .",
    "the family of the blocks ( without repetition ) of the partitions @xmath61 for @xmath62 forms the set of internal nodes of @xmath52 , the initial block @xmath29 $ ] of @xmath63 being seen as the root .",
    "the leaves of @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 ; we stress that a singleton @xmath66 may appear as an internal node of @xmath52 and should not be confused with the leaf @xmath67 .",
    "now consider the @xmath59th step at which the edge labeled @xmath68 is removed , and let @xmath69 denote the block of @xmath70 which contains @xmath68 .",
    "there are three possibilities .",
    "first , @xmath69 is reduced to the singleton @xmath71 ; in that case we draw a single edge between the internal node @xmath72 and the leaf @xmath68 .",
    "second , @xmath69 is not a singleton and @xmath73 is a block of @xmath54 ; then we draw an edge between the internal nodes @xmath69 and @xmath74 , and another edge between @xmath69 and the leaf @xmath68 . third , there are two distinct blocks @xmath74 and @xmath75 of @xmath54 which result from @xmath69 , that is , @xmath76",
    ". then we draw an edge between the internal nodes @xmath69 and @xmath74 , a second edge between the internal nodes @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath75 and a third edge between @xmath69 and the leaf @xmath68 . if @xmath0 is a random tree , we define @xmath52 by first conditioning on @xmath0 and then performing the above construction .    the main purpose of this work is to determine the asymptotic behavior ( in distribution ) of @xmath77 for a galton  watson tree @xmath5 with size @xmath1 , as @xmath2 . in this direction",
    ", it is appropriate to work in the framework of pointed metric measure spaces .",

    ".    it will be convenient to adopt a slightly different point of view for @xmath52 , by focusing on leaves rather than internal nodes .",

    "it is easily seen that @xmath52 , and in particular its combinatorial structure , can be recovered from @xmath78 ^ 0 , \\delta_n , \\mu_n)$ ] .",
    "we stress that in this framework , the root of the cut - tree ( which corresponds to the additional point @xmath82 in @xmath29 ^ 0 $ ] ) has a crucial role .",
    "indeed , the height ( distance to the root ) of the leaf @xmath67 in @xmath52 is precisely the total number of edge - removals from the successive blocks containing @xmath67 until the edge @xmath67 is finally removed .",
    "more generally , the number of internal nodes of the tree @xmath52 reduced to its root and @xmath10 leaves , say @xmath86 , coincides with the total number of edge - removals from the blocks which contain at least one of those @xmath10 leaves until each and every one of the edges with labels @xmath87 in @xmath45 have been removed .",
    "note also that this number differs from the total length of that reduced tree by , at most , @xmath10 units .",
    "for this reason , it will be important to recall that @xmath82 has been singled out in the metric space @xmath29 ^ 0 $ ] .",
    "[ seccut - tree - continuum ]    aldous and pitman  @xcite considered a cutting process on the brownian crt which bears obvious similarities with that defined in the preceding section for finite trees .",
    "we recall and develop some features in this setting that will be useful for our purpose .",
    "let us first recall some basic facts about topologies on metric measure spaces that we will need .",
    "a pointed metric measure space is a quadruple @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a complete metric space , @xmath90 and @xmath91 is a borel probability measure on @xmath89 .",
    "two such spaces @xmath88 and @xmath92 are called isometry - equivalent if there exists an isometry @xmath93 ( here @xmath94 is the topological support ) such that @xmath95 and the image of @xmath91 by @xmath96 is @xmath97 .",
    "this defines an equivalence relation between pointed metric measure spaces , and we note that the representatives @xmath88 of a given isometry - equivalence class can always be assumed to have @xmath98 .",
    "the set @xmath99 of ( isometry - equivalence classes of ) pointed metric measure spaces is a polish space when endowed with the so - called gromov ",
    "prokhorov topology .",
    "gromov s book  @xcite and the paper  @xcite are good references , although they deal with nonpointed spaces , which differs from our setting only in a minor way .",
    "recall that a sequence @xmath100 of pointed measure metric spaces converges in the gromov ",
    "prokhorov sense to @xmath101 if and only if the following holds : for @xmath102 , set @xmath103 and let @xmath104 be a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with law @xmath80 , then the vector @xmath105 converges in distribution to @xmath106 for every @xmath41",
    ".    now recall that @xmath17 denotes a brownian crt .",
    "it is endowed with the uniform probability `` mass '' measure @xmath91 and the usual distance @xmath107 , and also comes with a distinguished point called the root  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 is viewed as a random variable in @xmath99 .",
    "note that the root plays the same role as a @xmath91-randomly chosen point in @xmath17 , which is usually called the invariance property of @xmath17 under re - rooting .",
    "the distance @xmath107 induces an extra length measure @xmath108 , which is the unique @xmath109-finite measure assigning measure @xmath110 to the geodesic path between @xmath111 and @xmath112 in @xmath17 . roughly speaking , the probability measure @xmath91 is carried by the subset of leaves of @xmath17 while the length measure @xmath108 rather lives on the skeleton , that is , the complement of the set of leaves .    conditionally on @xmath17 , we introduce the family @xmath113 of the atoms of a poisson random measure with intensity @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a countable index set .",
    "we view these atoms as marks that are deposited along the skeleton of @xmath17 as time grows .",
    "let @xmath116 be the `` forest '' obtained by removing the points @xmath117 that are marked before time @xmath118 .",
    "for every @xmath119 we let @xmath120 be the @xmath91-mass of the component of @xmath116 that contains @xmath111 , where by convention we let @xmath121 if @xmath122 for some @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "aldous and pitman  @xcite have observed that if @xmath125 denotes a random point in @xmath17 distributed according to @xmath91 and independent of the poisson point process of marks on the skeleton , then the processes @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes the first - passage time process of a linear brownian motion .",
    "specializing results of  @xcite in this setting , we easily deduce that if we define @xmath128 then @xmath129 ( see section  [ sec32 ] below for details ) . as a consequence , @xmath130 a.s . for @xmath91-almost",
    "every @xmath111 .",
    "we next add to @xmath17 an extra point , denoted for simplicity by @xmath82 , and write @xmath131 ; @xmath82 serves , of course , as distinguished element of @xmath132 .",
    "we define a ( random ) function @xmath133 of two arguments in @xmath132 by setting @xmath134 where for @xmath135 with @xmath136 , @xmath137 denotes the ( a.s .",

    "note that @xmath137 is the first time where a mark appears on the geodesic from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , and as such it has an exponential distribution of parameter @xmath110 .",
    "observe also that @xmath138 a.s . since @xmath139 a.s . and that for every @xmath140 , @xmath141 a.s . since @xmath142 for all @xmath143 , a.s .",
    "let @xmath144 and @xmath145 be an i.i.d .",
    "sequence with law @xmath91 conditionally given @xmath17 .",
    "we will see in lemma  [ lem5 ] below that the two random semi - infinite matrices @xmath146 have the same distribution .",

    "a distance on the set @xmath147 , and @xmath148 can be understood as a _",
    "consistent family _ of random rooted trees with , respectively , @xmath10 leaves in the sense of aldous @xcite ; here , the spaces @xmath149 have @xmath150 elements while they should really be `` trees with edge - lengths '' in the context of aldous paper , but this is only a minor difference that does not affect our discussion .",
    "since @xmath17 satisfies the so - called _ leaf - tight property _ @xmath151 the family @xmath152 also satisfies this property with probability @xmath81 , even conditionally given @xmath17 and the poisson cuts @xmath153 . by theorem 3 in  @xcite , this shows that @xmath152 admits a representation as a continuum random tree , that we call @xmath28 .",
    "this means that , still given @xmath17 and the process of poisson marks , @xmath28 is a pointed metric measure space , with underlying distance function @xmath59 , root @xmath154 and probability measure @xmath155 , and that if @xmath156 is an infinite i.i.d .",
    "sequence with distribution @xmath155 , then the matrix @xmath157 has the same distribution as @xmath158 .",
    "up to performing this `` resampling , '' we thus see that @xmath159 can itself be seen as the matrix of mutual distances between the points of an i.i.d .",
    "sample of @xmath28 . in the previous discussion , we insisted on conditioning first on @xmath17 and @xmath153 so as to underline the fact that the random elements @xmath17 , @xmath153 and @xmath28 are defined on a common probability space .",
    "of course , the equality in distribution ( [ eqa1 ] ) entails that unconditionally , the random variable @xmath28 has the same distribution as @xmath17 .",
    "let us make a remark at this point .",
    "the reader might consider it more natural to define @xmath28 in a more `` concrete '' way , by first taking the quotient space of @xmath160 by the relation @xmath161 , and then taking a metric completion .",
    "this operation comes along with a natural mapping that first projects from @xmath132 onto the quotient space , and then injects in the completion .",
    "therefore , we could endow the space with the image measure of @xmath91 by this natural mapping .",
    "however , several measurability issues appear here : first , this mapping should be measurable in order that this construction makes sense , and second , it should be checked that the law of the resulting random metric measure space is indeed a measurable function of the tree  @xmath17 .",
    "these issues do not appear in our context because aldous construction defines @xmath28 only in terms of the sequence of random variables @xmath162 .",
    "we believe that these issues can be overcome , however , we are not going to consider them here to keep this work to a reasonable size .",
    "if @xmath163 is a pointed metric measure space and @xmath164 , we let @xmath165 be the same space with distances rescaled by the factor @xmath166 .",
    "[ t ] [ sectree - representation ] as @xmath2 , we have the following joint convergence in distribution in @xmath167 , endowed with the product topology ( @xmath99 having the gromov  prokhorov topology ) : @xmath168 moreover , @xmath28 has the same distribution as @xmath17",

    "[ t2 ] [ sectree - representation ] as @xmath2 , the following two weak convergences hold jointly in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions : @xmath174 and @xmath175    we conclude this introduction with three remarks .",
    "first , it follows from theorem  [ t ] that @xmath176 in particular , the total length @xmath177 of the cut - tree of @xmath5 reduced to @xmath10 leaves chosen uniformly at random , converges after renormalization by a factor @xmath178 to the total length of a brownian crt reduced to @xmath10 i.i.d .",
    "leaves picked according to the mass measure @xmath91 .",
    "since the latter is known to have the chi@xmath15-distribution and @xmath177 only differs from the number @xmath179 of edge - deletions which are needed to recover @xmath10 distinguished edges picked uniformly at random in @xmath180 by at most @xmath10 units , we thus see that proposition  [ p1 ] follows from theorem  [ t ] .",
    "second , we do not know whether the weak convergence stated in the theorem holds for stronger topologies of the gromov  hausdorff type , even though this is indeed the case when we only consider the first component .",
    "third , in order to ease the presentation , it has been convenient to work with trees on a set of labeled vertices , namely , @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "this induces a structure which is not relevant for our main results , as these could be stated in terms of graph - theoretic trees over a finite set of vertices considered up to graph isomorphisms .",
    "the labeling of the vertices comes naturally when considering galton  watson trees ; however , it could be ignored after the object is sampled .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t ] is rather long and relies on several intermediate results .      in this section @xmath1",
    "is fixed ; we consider an arbitrary tree @xmath0 on @xmath29 $ ] and write as usual @xmath45 for its planted version with @xmath1 edges .",
    "we shall define a modified distance on its cut - tree , which is both close to the rescaled initial distance on @xmath181 and resembles the distance defined in section  [ sec14 ] for the brownian crt .",
    "imagine that we mark each edge @xmath182 with rate @xmath18 , independently of the other edges .",
    "in particular , the first mark is assigned after an exponentially distributed time with mean @xmath18 , and the edge which is first marked is independent of that time and has the uniform distribution @xmath183 on the set @xmath184 of the @xmath1 edges of @xmath45 ( recall that the set of edges of the planted tree @xmath45 can be canonically identified with the set @xmath29 $ ] of vertices of @xmath0 , so that by a slight abuse , @xmath183 denotes indistinctively the uniform probability measure on the set of vertices of @xmath0 or on the set of edges of @xmath45 ) .",
    "if we remove the edge @xmath33 at the instant when it is marked , then we obtain a continuous time version of edge - deletion process described in section  [ sec13 ] .",

    "[ c2 ] in the preceding notation , we have @xmath405    for a vertex @xmath406 , let @xmath407 be the edge pointing down from @xmath408 to the base , and for an edge @xmath33 of @xmath409 , let @xmath410 be the vertex such that @xmath411 .",
    "let also @xmath412 be the graph distance in @xmath409 between the vertices @xmath413 .",
    "observe first that for every vertex @xmath406 , the edge @xmath407 counts in the enumeration of @xmath398 if and only if no edge on the path from @xmath407 to @xmath264 has been removed at time @xmath118 .",
    "conditionally given @xmath414 , and for a given vertex @xmath406 , this happens with probability @xmath415 if @xmath416 is an ancestor of @xmath408 , and with probability @xmath417 otherwise . by distinguishing the vertex @xmath416 , for which the first formula holds , from the other vertices",
    ", we thus have @xmath418 where the second identity follows from the fact that given @xmath409 , @xmath416 has the uniform law in @xmath419 .    next , notice that the set of pointed trees @xmath349 with exactly @xmath1 edges has @xmath351-measure equal to @xmath420 , a quantity which is strictly positive and finite by hypothesis .",
    "so the conditional law @xmath421 on the space of pointed trees with @xmath1 edges is well defined , and corresponds to the distribution of @xmath422 where given @xmath5 , @xmath423 is a uniformly chosen vertex in @xmath424 .    combining these observations",
    ", we deduce that @xmath425 by definition , the number of vertices @xmath426 at distance @xmath41 from the pointed vertex @xmath350 equals @xmath427",
    ". therefore , @xmath428 where in the second step we performed a change of index .",
    "we conclude that @xmath429 by proposition  [ secverif - hypoth - eqrefhy ] , we have on the one hand that @xmath430 on the other hand , we saw in the proof of proposition [ secverif - hypoth - eqrefhy ] that under @xmath351 , the trees @xmath431 and @xmath354 are independent , with @xmath354 having law @xmath432 . therefore , since @xmath433 , we have @xmath434 which completes the proof .",
    "lemma  [ lem3 ] now follows readily from the following result by janson ( see theorem  1.13 in  @xcite ) ; there exists some finite constant @xmath435 depending only on the offspring distribution @xmath37 , such that @xmath436 for every @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , we derive from corollary  [ c2 ] that for every @xmath437 , @xmath438",
