    "the higgs boson mass , 125  gev , suggests that the physics behind the electroweak symmetry breaking is weakly coupled , but it is not quite as light as the predictions of tev scale supersymmetry . in order to explain the higgs boson mass in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the superpartner masses especially the scalar top quarks needs to be above @xmath7  tev in a generic region of the parameter space @xcite .    in light of this situation ,",
    "models with @xmath8(pev ) scale rather than @xmath7  tev supersymmetry have been discussed quite extensively @xcite .",
    "( for earlier studies , see @xcite . ) the reason for this jump from tev to pev is based on the constraints from the flavor and cp violating processes @xcite",
    ". the flavor and cp constraints can be ( almost ) avoided by raising the susy scale to pev , while the dark matter of the universe can be explained by the thermal relic of the light gauginos , in particular the wino @xcite , whose masses can be suppressed by a one - loop factor ( and thus tev scale ) as in the anomaly mediation scenario @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is another natural framework with @xmath9  tev susy .",
    "since we need some mechanism to suppress large flavor and cp violations , the gravity - mediated contributions which generically break flavor and cp should be suppressed , i.e. , the gravitino should be much lighter than other susy particles . in this case",
    ", the gravitino can be a good candidate of the dark matter ; its abundance may be explained by the decay of other susy particles which are thermally produced @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the scenario where all susy breaking parameters except gaugino mass are set to be zero at the cut - off scale , and thus the severe flavor and cp constraints can be alleviated .",
    "such a set - up has been studied as the low energy effective theory of the gaugino mediation scenario @xcite or the no - scale supergravity lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the right - handed stau tends to be the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) and its decay into the gravitino may explain the observed dark matter abundance .",
    "however it is non - trivial whether the higgs boson mass and dark matter abundance can be explained simultaneously in this simple set - up .",
    "the large stau mass is required to avoid the severe constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) while stop masses are bounded from above according to the value of @xmath10 to explain the observed higgs boson mass .",
    "we discuss the running behavior of the higgs @xmath11 term carefully and find that a new parameter set with relatively small @xmath10 appears for a large susy breaking scale even with vanishing higgs @xmath11 term at the cut - off scale .",
    "this helps to solve the above - mentioned tension ; small @xmath10 enlarges the right - handed stau mass and also relax the upper bound on stop masses .",
    "the small gravity - mediated contributions can become the sources of flavor and cp violation in the model .",
    "however we find that , thanks to the small value of @xmath10 , the predicted electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) is marginal to the present experimental bound and should be checked in the near future experiments .",

    "since these contributions are proportional to gaugino masses , there appear no cp phases at the low energy scale as long as phases of three gaugino mass parameters are aligned .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of sfermion mass are also generated only radiatively through the ckm matrix , and the flavor constraints can become rather weak .",

    "non - thermally produced gravitinos can not be the main constituent of the cold dark matter .",
    "the gravitinos can be also produced thermally by scattering processes with particles in the thermal bath .",
    "the resultant abundance is approximately proportional to the reheating temperature after the inflation , @xmath143 , and it reads @xcite @xmath144 requiring the total gravitino abundance is smaller than the observed dark matter abundance , @xmath145 , we obtain the upper bounds on the reheating temperature .    in figure [",
    "fig : tr ] we show the upper bounds on the reheating temperatures in the @xmath146 plane for the scenario @xmath36 , @xmath38  and @xmath39 .",
    "gray shaded regions can not explain the higgs mass even if the top mass is chosen in the range of @xmath45 .",
    "the gravitino abundance exceeds the observed dark matter abundance in the blue regions .",
    "purple regions are excluded by the bbn constraints , which imply @xmath147 , and the correct ewsb minimum can not be obtained in the brown regions .",
    "yellow regions are disfavored by the electron edm constraint , assuming @xmath148 ( light yellow ) and @xmath149 ( dark yellow ) .",
    "apart from the calculation of the higgs mass we choose @xmath150 in this plot , and its precise value is less sensitive to the predictions of the reheating temperature and other constraints .",
    "we find that the gravitino mass should be less than about 10 gev in the scenario @xmath36  and @xmath38   to suppress the susy contributions to the electron edm . with this small gravitino mass",
    "the reheating temperature becomes relatively low , less than about @xmath151 gev . in the scenario @xmath39",
    "the constraint from the edm becomes weaker , and the upper bound on the reheating temperature is raised up to @xmath152 gev .",
    "= 0.45 = 0.45    = 0.45",
    "in this paper we have discussed a model where the susy breaking effects are mediated only to the gaugino mass terms at the leading order as a simple solution for the susy flavor and cp problems .",
    "the gravitino mass should be smaller than other susy breaking parameters to suppress the gravity - mediated contributions , which are the main sources of flavor and cp violation in our model .",
    "thus , in the presence of the r - parity conservation , the gravitino becomes a good candidate of the cold dark matter in our universe .",
    "we carefully examine the rg running of the @xmath11 parameter and find that the parameter region with small @xmath10 appears as the susy scale increases .",
    "thanks to the smallness of @xmath10 , the susy breaking scale to explain the higgs boson mass is pushed up , and especially the nlsp right - handed stau mass is increased .",
    "then , since the life - time of the nlsp staus is shorten in this parameter region , the whole of the observed dark matter abundance can be explained by the gravitinos produced by the decay of other susy particles without destroying the successful predictions of the standard bbn scenario .",
    "since the @xmath11 parameter is relatively small compared to other susy breaking parameter , it is affected by the small gravity - mediated contributions .",
    "thus we expect non - negligible susy contributions to the electron and nucleon edms .",
    "we find that the naively expected sizes of the electron edm are on the edge of the current experimental limit , and it should be checked in the near future experiments .",
    "especially the ratios of the nucleon edms to the electron edm become the key ingredients for the discrimination of our model with others .",
    "our model is very predictive and the whole of the susy mass spectrum is fixed if the top yukawa coupling is measured precisely and the theoretical errors in the higgs mass calculation are reduced .",
    "then it is important to measure the mass of the lightest mssm susy particle , right - handed stau , at the future collider experiments such as in the future @xmath153 hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "we expect that our model would be tested by the combination of the future collider and edm experiments .",
    "finally we comment on the uv theory of the model . in this analysis the @xmath1 term",
    "is assumed to be a fundamental parameter which is comparable to the susy scale and tuned to generate the correct electroweak scale . and also , the gravitino mass is treated as a free parameter . to understand the whole picture of our model , it is desirable to construct the uv model which explains the origin of @xmath1 term and predicts the preferable gravitino mass .    _ acknowledgements",
