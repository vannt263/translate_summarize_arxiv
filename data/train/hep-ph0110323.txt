    "it has been noted for a long time that the renormalization of the gauge coupling constant of supersymmetric yang - mills theories has special improved properties compared to usual gauge theories .",
    "these improved renormalization properties are reflected in the closed all - order expression for the gauge @xmath0 function @xcite .",
    "the improved renormalization property of the coupling constant which is not apparent in usual perturbation theory has been seen in connection with absence of two - loop and higher - order terms to the coupling constant in the wilsonian effective action @xcite .",

    "introduces a chiral and antichiral field multiplet and identifies their real part with the inverse of the square of the ( local ) gauge coupling . due to the construction the complex part of their lowest components couples to a total derivative , explicitly to the divergence of the axial current and to the topological term @xmath2 .",
    "this property can be formulated in form of a ward identity and yields holomorphicity of symmetric counterterms independent of the usage of a wilsonian effective action . in particular symmetric counterterms to the coupling are only present in one - loop order independent of the specific subtraction scheme one uses .",
    "as for the wilsonian approach also in the present construction naive applications of symmetries result in a purely one - loop @xmath0-function .",
    "however , when the coupling is extended to an external superfield , supersymmetry has an anomalous breaking in one - loop order @xcite .",
    "we have shown , that it is the anomalous breaking which generates the 2-loop coefficient of the gauge @xmath0-function . by this analysis the coefficient of the anomaly",
    "is implicitly determined by the scheme - independent value of the two - loop @xmath0-function .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to determine the anomaly coefficient explicitly in one - loop order . for this purpose",
    "we use a background gauge field and background gauge invariance . solving then the slavnov  taylor identity we find an expression for the anomaly coefficient in terms of convergent one - loop integrals . by explicit evaluation of the one - loop diagrams we find that the anomaly coefficient is determined by the feynman - gauge value of the one loop corrections to @xmath3 of background fields .",
    "hence , these contributions effect a supersymmetry breaking of super - yang - mills theories in the wess - zumino gauge .",

    "the extension of coupling constants to space - time dependent superfields has been seen to be a crucial step for the formulation and derivation of supersymmetric non - renormalization theorems in a scheme and gauge - independent framework @xcite . for gauge theories the extension to local couplings does not only include the non - renormalization theorems of the chiral vertices @xcite but also the generalized non - renormalization theorem of the gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "the latter property constitutes itself in absence of symmetric counterterms to the susy yang - mills part of the action in loop orders higher than one .",

    "the anomalous breaking is the supervariation of a field monomial depending on the logarithm of the local coupling and a such its coefficient has been shown to be scheme independent and gauge parameter independent .",
    "this anomalous breaking has been shown to induce the non - holomorphic dependence in the gauge @xmath0-function of pure super - yang - mills theories , whereas the matter contributions are induced by the adler - bardeen anomaly .    in the present paper",
    "we have determined the coefficient of the anomaly in a one - loop calculation .",
    "the computation has been carried out in a completely scheme and regularization independent framework .",
    "for this purpose we have first established the symmetry identities which determine the anomaly coefficient . from these identities",
    "all contributing one - loop vertex functions are fixed by symmetries and not by a scheme - dependent subtraction procedure .",
    "the analysis has been simplified by the use of a background gauge fixing which allows to exploit transversality of 2-point functions involving the background vector fields .",
    "evaluating the anomaly identities yields the anomaly coefficient in terms of convergent one - loop integrals .",
    "the explicit computation has been carried out in the feynman gauge . here",
    "the anomaly coefficient is directly determined by the vertex correction to the topological term @xmath172 at vanishing momenta .",
    "there are two terms which contribute to @xmath173 in one - loop order , these are diagrams with the insertion of the axial current of gluinos and with the insertion of the topological chern - simons current .",
    "the first diagram yields the local contributions known from the triangle anomaly , the second yields a non - local and in general even gauge dependent contribution . in the feynman gauge and at vanishing momenta the topological current yields a local contribution twice as large as the contribution of the axial current and with opposite sign .",
    "thus , they sum up to the non - vanishing anomaly coefficient of super - yang - mills with local gauge coupling .",
    "the result is valid also for @xmath174 super - yang - mills theories with matter , when the matter part is extended to local couplings as proposed in @xcite .",
    "this construction may be modified when one aims at the construction of @xmath175 and @xmath176 theories resulting in a higher symmetry and finally in a vanishing anomaly coefficient .    in the wilsonian approach",
    "the non - holomorphic dependence of the gauge @xmath0-function has been recently related to a rescaling anomaly , which appears due to the redefinition from the holomorphic to the canonical coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the present results are independent of the notion of a wilsonian coupling , and thus the relations of these findings to our results are not apparent at the first glance .    in earlier publications on the topic @xcite , however , a relation between the vertex corrections to @xmath177 and the two - loop coefficient of the gauge @xmath0-function has been already suggested , but the classical symmetry , to which @xmath177 contributes an anomalous breaking , could not be established .",
    "thus , the anomalous contributions have been identified by an infrared analysis claiming a similarity between the infrared renormalization of the axial current and the topological current @xcite .    for",
    "the present construction infrared effects do not play any role , but what is essential , is the extension to local coupling . with local coupling the gauge invariant counterterms to @xmath172",
    "are not a total derivative in higher orders and as such they are excluded from the present construction .",
    "hence , with a non - integrated local coupling transversality can be exploited to fix uniquely the local contributions , i.e. the divergent part of the vertex function , from convergent tensor integrals , finding a unique result also in the limit of constant coupling .    in this respect the construction may be also interesting for non - supersymmetric theories : renormalization of @xmath172 has to be considered for establishing the non - renormalization theorems @xcite of the adler - bardeen anomaly @xcite as a composite operator its definition is not unique as it stands , but its definition can been traced back to renormalization of a finite operator by the usage of descent equations @xcite .",
    "these difficulties can be circumvented by extending the gauge coupling to a space - time dependent field .",
    "then the renormalization of @xmath172 is unique and can be directly deduced from gauge invariance or more generally brs invariance and from its property as being a total derivative , in the same way as it was worked out in section 3 of the present paper .",
    "hence , the local and possibly divergent contribution to the anomaly is related to the superficially convergent tensor part stating the adler - bardeen non - renormalization theorem .",
