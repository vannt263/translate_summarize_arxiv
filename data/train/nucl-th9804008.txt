    "the main goal of the relativistic heavy - ion experiments at brookhaven and cern is to study the properties , e.g. the equation of state ( eos ) , of strongly interacting hot and dense hadronic matter produced in the course of nuclear collisions .",
    "a question of great importance in these studies is to determine the eos and whether local ( lte ) or even global thermodynamical equilibrium is reached in the system or not .",
    "this is a crucial point for a large group of models , widely used for data analysis .",
    "despite the long history of such investigations ( e.g. @xcite ) , this question remains still open .",
    "one can try to check the assumption of lte by analyzing the experimental particle number ratios and hadron momentum spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) . due to the time duration of chemical ( inelastic ) and",
    "kinetic ( elastic ) freeze - out of the system in a+a collisions @xcite , the answer is not conclusive .",
    "in contrast to the microscopic approaches @xcite , macroscopic models like hydrodynamical @xcite or thermal @xcite models adopt lte as ad hoc assumption , use the equation of state @xcite as a parametrization and apply usually an instantaneous freeze - out of hadrons , produced from many different space - time cells . the freeze - out conditions for these cells  temperatures , baryonic chemical potentials and collective velocities ",
    "are actually quite different and model dependent ( see e.g. @xcite ) . also note that the experimental particle spectra in elementary @xmath3 and hadron - hadron collisions at high energies already look `` thermalized '' @xcite .    because of these difficulties it is very promising to check the lte and to extract the eos at different stages of relativistic heavy ion reactions based on a detailed microscopic analysis . here , we employ for a such analysis the microscopic ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd ) @xcite .",
    "urqmd is a n - body transport model designed for describing heavy ion collisions in the laboratory energy range from several mev to several tev per nucleon .",
    "the detailed presentation of urqmd and underlying concepts together with a comparison with experimental data is now publically accessible @xcite .",
    "the model treats binary elastic and inelastic hadronic collisions and many - body resonance decays .",
    "the inelastic collisions and decays are the only source for changing the chemical composition of the system , while elastic collisions change only the momentum distributions of the hadrons .",
    "both processes drive the system towards thermodynamical equilibrium",
    ". however , the time scales may be too short in heavy ion collisions for actually achieving lte .",
    "the urqmd model is based on string and resonance excitation both in primary nucleon - nucleon collisions from projectile and target , some also in secondary hadronic collisions .",
    "there are 55 baryon and 32 meson states as discrete degrees of freedom in the model as well as their anti - particles and explicit isospin - projected states with masses up to 2.5 gev . from 1.5 gev",
    "the strings can be populated as continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "the experimental hadron cross sections and resonance decay widths are used when possible . at high energies a string mechanism",
    "is implemented to simulate soft hadronic interactions .",
    "hadrons , produced through the string decays , have non - zero formation time which depends on the four - momentum of the particle .",
    "newly produced particles can not interact during their formation time .",
    "leading hadrons ( containing the constituent quarks ) interact within their formation time , but with reduced cross sections , proportional to the number of original valence quarks .",
    "the pauli principle is applied to bb collisions by blocking the final state if the outgoing phase space is occupied .",
    "no bose effects for mesons are implemented in urqmd .",
    "now let us use the urqmd model to explore to which extent lte can be reached at least in a small cell around the origin of central ( b=0 fm ) au+au collisions at 10.7 agev .",
    "the formation of hot and dense hadronic matter is expected in this reaction , therefore the comparison of local system properties predicted by urqmd with those of the ideal hadron gas looks promising .    for our analysis",
    "we consider a cubic cell of volume @xmath4  @xmath5 centered around the origin of center - of - mass of au+au system .",
    "the collective velocity of this cell is equal to zero because the system geometry gives no preferable direction for the collective motion .",
    "the cell size should be small enough to avoid collective flow ( and streaming ) and not to underestimate densities inside the cell .",
    "on the other hand it should be large enough to contain enough particles inside the cell , which guarantees reasonably small fluctuations of particle observables in the cell . from our analysis",
    "( see below ) it appears that a cubic cell with a side of 5  fm satisfies simultaneously both above requirements for 200 au+au central collisions at ags energy .",
    "we start by analyzing the time evolution of different physical quantities in the au+au center - of - mass frame .",
    "time @xmath6 fm / c corresponds to the moment when the two lorentz contracted nuclei touch each other .",
    "the maximum overlap of the nuclei occurs at about 2.5  fm / c . at time",
    "@xmath75.5 fm / c the freely streaming nuclei would have passed through each other .    the reaction is dominated by strong momentum anisotropies for all particles inside the cell . during the entire high energy density phase , @xmath810  fm / c , the widths of the velocity distributions in the longitudinal ( @xmath9direction , @xmath10 , are much larger then the widths in the transverse ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) directions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for each hadron species .",
    "however , for @xmath110  fm / c the anisotropies inside the central cell disappear and the widths @xmath15 become approximately equal .",
    "the velocity component distributions of nucleons in the cell , shown in fig .  1 at two different times , confirm this result .",
    "the shapes of the velocity distributions are very different for @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath18=5  fm / c .",
    "they become very similar at @xmath18=10  fm / c .",
    "this approximate isotropy of hadronic velocity distributions in the central cell appears to be due to the escape of fast or non - scattered particles from the cell and as a result of many hadronic rescatterings . at @xmath1910  fm",
    "/ c the newly produced particles in the cell have undergone from 1.5 ( pions and @xmath20 ) to 5 ( k ) elastic collisions , while the baryons have suffered more than 20 strong interactions .",
    "2 shows the large difference between the hadrons containing original constituent quarks ( @xmath21 ) and newly bred mesons ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "there are still some collisions in the cell at @xmath2318 fm / c .",
    "3 shows that for @xmath2418  fm / c only a small fraction of the particles in the cell is frozen out before that time .",
    "the isotropy of the momentum distributions for all hadron species in the cell is a necessary prerequisite for lte .",
    "the next observation is that hadron energy spectra in the central cell at @xmath110 fm / c are nicely fitted by boltzmann distributions , @xmath25 , with rapidly falling @xmath26values vs. time . at each moment , however , all particle species  @xmath27 exhibit practically the same slope .",
    "the `` temperatures '' , @xmath28 , agree to within @xmath2910  mev .",
    "to study chemical equilibrium in detail , let us now compare the hadron spectra and yields in the cell , as predicted by urqmd model , with those of a statistical model of an ideal hadron gas ( sm ) @xcite . for this comparison of the urqmd results to the sm model the time interval from 10 to",
    "18  fm / c is chosen .",
    "the largest values of the energy density , @xmath30 , and baryonic density , @xmath31 , in the central reaction zone are reached earlier , at @xmath324 - 5  fm / c . at this time , however , the system of particles in the cell is not yet thermalized and still exhibits strong velocity anisotropy . at @xmath33  fm / c",
    "there is also a large fraction of non - formed and non - interacting particles in the cell , particularly mesons ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "hence , the physical interpretation of this early stage of the reaction should - in the present approach - not be carried forward in a sm model . for @xmath110  fm / c the fraction of non - formed particles goes to zero rapidly . on the other hand",
    "the total number of particles in the cell is small at @xmath34  fm / c and the system approaches its thermal freeze - out ( no collisions occur ) stage . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis of lte to the time interval between @xmath18=1018  fm / c .",
    "we do not discuss the `` initial '' stage with high energy density and the `` final '' kinetic stage of particle freeze - out .",
    "for a thermalized ideal gas the momentum spectrum of particle species `` i '' in the rest frame of the cell can be presented as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the volume of the cell , @xmath28 is the temperature of the system in the cell , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the degeneracy factor , the mass , the energy and the chemical potential of the hadron species `` i '' , correspondingly . here ,",
    "boltzmann distribution functions , @xmath41 , are used for all hadrons .",
    "quantum statistical effects are not included in the present analysis .    with the term thermodynamical equilibrium we specifically mean both kinetic and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the chemical potential of particle _",
    "i _ in lte can be represented as @xmath42 in terms of the baryonic- , @xmath43 , and strange- , @xmath44 , chemical potentials ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 are , respectively , the baryonic- and strange- charges of the particle species `` i '' ) .",
    "the electric chemical potential considered in @xcite is neglected .",
    "here , 200 au+au events , generated with urqmd , are analyzed using the following procedure .",
    "the average energy density , @xmath47 , baryonic density , @xmath48 , and net strangeness density , @xmath49 , in the cell are calculated for 10@xmath5018  fm / c .",
    "the contributions of both formed and not yet formed particles are included .",
    "the values of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are inserted in the l.h.s . of the following equations : @xmath51 here @xmath52 are the number- and energy density of particle species `` i '' predicted by the ideal gas model .",
    "the ideal gas model employs the same hadron species `` i '' as the urqmd model . solving the system of three equations ( 3 ) for the three unknown parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we find the results presented in table  1 .",
    "now we can turn to the predictions of the statistical model ( sm ) for the specific single particle spectra , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , by using the intensive parameters @xmath28 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , extracted from the average energy density , @xmath47 , baryon density , @xmath48 , and strangeness density , @xmath49 .",
    "also the pressure and the entropy can be calculated swiftly ( see below ) . the boltzmann energy spectra eq .",
    "( 1 ) predicted by the sm with @xmath53 values from table  1 and the spectra obtained in the urqmd model in the central cell for different particle species agree surprisingly well for all instants @xmath18 between 10 and 18  fm / c . fig .",
    "4 shows this comparison for @xmath18=13  fm / c . between 10 and 18 fm / c",
    "also the hadronic yields , obtained in the sm , are rather close to the urqmd data , see fig .",
    "these results seem to indicate that the lte is closely resembled for the hadronic matter in central cell of central au+au collisions at 10.7 agev at least for @xmath1910 to 18 fm / c .",
    "the statistical model parameters , i.e. the main thermodynamic characteristics of the cell change rapidly with time .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that a fireball type description of hadronic matter is inadequate .",
    "table 1 shows that during this time interval ( 10  18 fm / c ) the baryonic density and temperature in the cell change from @xmath54 to 0.3@xmath55 ( @xmath56  @xmath57 is the normal nuclear density ) and from @xmath58150  mev to 100  mev . the time evolution of the central cell in ( @xmath28 , @xmath59 ) plane is shown in fig .",
    "5 . it resembles closely an isentropic hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "let us develop this idea in detail .",
    "the hadron pressure is given in the statistical model by @xmath60 using eq .",
    "( 4 ) we find that the equation of state , @xmath61 , of the hadronic matter in the central region of au+au collisions at 10.7 agev is nearly linear with @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , @xmath62 is constant for the whole time interval @xmath18=1018  fm / c @xmath63 this constant corresponds to the square of the speed of sound in the medium , @xmath640.12 , which is very similar to that in a resonance gas , @xmath650.14 , obtained in @xcite .",
    "the constant behaviour of @xmath62 confirms that transport models like urqmd and rqmd do not predict any phase transition which would be manifest in the softest point of the eos , @xmath62 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "6 we compare the ideal gas pressure eq .",
    "( 4 ) with longitudinal , @xmath66 , and transverse , @xmath67 , pressures obtained in urqmd as @xcite : @xmath68 where v is volume of the cell , @xmath69 represents the particle momentum and the sum in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is taken over all hadrons @xmath70 in the cell .",
    "6 shows a strong difference between @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath810  fm / c . that this is due to the longitudinal flow in the cell at early times can be seen from the dashed curve , obtained for a cell with a shortened longitudinal side , @xmath73 fm .",
    "the difference between @xmath74 and @xmath75 vanishes already at @xmath196 fm / c , but at so early times there is still no equilibrium in the cell : the slopes of the energy spectra are quite different for different particle species . only at @xmath3210 fm",
    "/ c the hadronic matter in the cell becomes equilibrated . at this time the microscopic pressure eq.(6 ) in both cells also becomes nearly isotropic and approximately equal to the ideal gas one eq.(4 ) , @xmath76 .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the transverse and the longitudinal components of the pressure is also observed in three - fluid hydrodynamical model for the initial stages of central au+au collisions at ags @xcite .",
    "this finding is in stark contrast to the one - fluid hydrodynamical model , where the pressure is assumed to be locally isotropic at all times .",
    "corse graining problems inhibit the direct microscopic calculations of the entropy .",
    "however , the entropy density @xmath77 can be calculated from the ideal gas model ( using the microscopic @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 as input , see above ) by the thermodynamical identity @xmath78 the strange particle contribution is negligibly small ( @xmath79  mev maximally ) in comparison to the other terms which are of order 100 mev .",
    "the entropy per baryon in the cell is nearly constant and is equal to @xmath80 hence , the time evolution of the cell is nearly isentropic for times @xmath18=1018  fm / c and , therefore , similar to an ideal hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "quantum statistical effects in the ideal hadron gas are small for the temperatures and chemical potentials , @xmath28 and @xmath81 , from the table  1 .",
    "bose statistics gives the strongest effect for the pions  the bose pion number density at @xmath28= 100150  mev is about 10% larger than the boltzmann approximation .",
    "the quantum statistical effects are only 1 - 2% for other hadrons .",
    "to make a conclusion about lte in heavy ion collisions in a given microscopic model one has to perform a comparison not only to the statistical model , but also to an equilibrated infinite matter system within the same microscopic model .",
    "the energy spectra and the particle yields in the central cell of au+au collisions were compared to the equilibrated hadronic matter calculations obtained in a box with periodic boundary conditions by employing the urqmd model to such a closed system with the approximate microcanonical infinite matter .",
    "this closed box calculations must clearly be distinguished from the open system , off equilibrium , in the central cell of heavy ion collisions discussed before .",
    "the particle yields and energy spectra predicted in the urqmd box calculations @xcite for each set of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 values taken from table 1 for the different time steps are in a good agreement with the urqmd predictions in the central cell of au+au collisions ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "this additionally confirms that at the intermediate stage of the reaction @xmath191018 fm / c the hadronic matter in the cell is in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "this also means that the closed box calculations ( as well as sm ) can be used to describe - of course not to predict - the time evolution of locally equilibrated open system of the heavy ion collisions discussed above .",
    "the static box values agree approximately with the ideal gas hadron model .",
    "however , there are enhancements of the low - energy pion yields as compared to the ideal gas results observed in both the urqmd cell- and the box- calculations , seen in fig .  4 .",
    "the box calculations @xcite , at @xmath82 , show that this enhancement becomes even stronger with increasing energy density .",
    "this enhancement is due to the violation of the detailed balance conditions for string- and many - body resonance decays in microscopic models like urqmd @xcite .",
    "the additional pion production from many - body decay channels acts like a positive pion chemical potential .",
    "the bose enhancement of pions should therefore be more pronounced at higher energy densities @xcite .",
    "equilibration of hadronic matter produced in the central cell of au+au collisions at 10.7  agev has been studied in the microscopic urqmd model .",
    "it is found that    * there are large deviations from thermal equilibrium for the high density phase , @xmath810  fm / c . *",
    "local thermal and chemical equilibration seems to set in , in the central cell , for the expansion stage , @xmath18=1018  fm / c . * both the different particle yields and the energy spectra in the central cell change drastically with time .",
    "still , their instantaneous values agree , separately , for different time steps @xmath110  fm / c , with correspondingly adjusted ideal hadron gas model values . * the temperatures and baryonic densities extracted in the central cell drop rapidly from @xmath83150 to 100  mev and from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for @xmath1910 to 18 fm / c . *",
    "the entropy per baryon is nearly constant , @xmath86 , during the time interval @xmath191018 fm / c . *",
    "the equation of state of this complex mixture of different particle `` fluids '' has a very simple form @xmath87 for this range of @xmath88values . * a substantial enhancement of low - energy pions",
    "is observed in the urqmd calculations as compared to the ideal gas results .",
    "this effect increases at higher energy densities due to the string- and many - body decays of the resonances .",
    "* at @xmath18=1018  fm / c the spectra and hadron multiplicities in the central reaction cell are in agreement with those found for equilibrated infinite matter in urqmd calculations in a box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the time scale of the thermal and chemical equilibration is , however , much shorter in the present calculations for nuclear reactions in the cell than in the urqmd box calculations .",
    "it is the short - lived pre - equilibrium high density initial phase which prepares the extreme entropy densities forming doorway state to the quasi - isentropic expansion for @xmath110  fm / c .",
    "let us stress again that these studies support a picture of strong deviation from _ local _ thermodynamical equilibration in the central cell for @xmath810  fm / c in a+a collisions at ags energies .",
    "large collective streaming - through flow is found even in the central cell at early times .",
    "the whole system never reaches _ global _ thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , local equilibration is approached in central cell for the later times , @xmath110 fm / c .",
    "these flow effects are not large , however , at @xmath110 fm / c in the central cell , that is why it was chosen .",
    "the averaged squared velocities in the central cell at @xmath18=10  fm / c are @xmath89 and @xmath90 for all particle species .",
    "these values are much smaller than the thermal velocities of the various hadrons in the cell at that time . for nucleons",
    "one finds @xmath91 .",
    "thermal velocities for pions and kaons are even larger .",
    "our analysis neglects this small collective motion inside the central cell at @xmath18=1018  fm .",
    "more careful studies give corrections to this picture : in fig .",
    "4 one observes that the `` best fits '' to the particle spectra would give @xmath92 : small collective motion inside the cell can imitate slightly larger ( several percents ) effective temperatures for heavier particles in the ideal gas calculations .",
    "much larger flow velocities are found for all cells other than the central one .",
    "a similar analysis has been done at lower energies in @xcite .",
    "the next step is to study the approach to lte for the earlier phase of the evolution and at higher collision energies ( from the ags to the sps ) .",
    "this requires much smaller cell sizes and correspondingly larger samples of a+a events .",
