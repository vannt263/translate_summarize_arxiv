    "the stability of the splay - phase is interesting because in the mean field limit ( @xmath327 ) it has been shown to be unstable for inhibitory coupling @xcite . in the mean field limit for homogeneous neurons",
    ", the splay - phase state corresponds to an ` asynchronous ' state where the density of the firing times of the neurons is constant .",
    "we can see how this instability arises in our formalism . as more neurons",
    "are added , the synapse must rise faster for stability . in the limit of infinite numbers of neurons ,",
    "stability is not possible no matter how fast the synapse since @xmath328 . with weak heterogeneity ,",
    "a stable perturbed splay - phase state is possible as long as the rise time of the synapse is shorter than the smallest phase difference .",

    "these states have their counterparts for a network of n neurons as well .    if the heterogeneity is large then our analysis in sec .",
    "[ nsynch ] shows that stable synchrony can be broken .",
    "if the applied currents are very strong or the synapses are very weak then the period can become too short to support stable synchrony . in this case , the neurons will become effectively decoupled and fire asynchronously as in the two neuron case .",

    "the average density of neurons at a given phase need not be constant as in the homogeneous case .",
    "if the heterogeneity is very broad then it is possible that asynchrony and synchrony can coexist  @xcite .",
    "if the applied currents are weak and the synapses are strong then stable synchrony can again be broken .",
    "for inhibition , the possible outcomes are harmonic locking or suppression . here",
    "the slower neurons can not keep up with the faster ones .",
    "the dynamics will be similar to two self - inhibited neurons .",
    "the influence of the other neurons in the network with weakly heterogeneous applied currents acts like self - inhibition .",
    "if a neuron is too slow compared to a group of other neurons , then it can drop out of the rhythm .",
    "as the synaptic strength is increased , more and more neurons will drop out until only one remains .",
    "the condition for suppression can be estimated from the combined synaptic input the neuron receives over a period .",
    "similarly , complicated harmonic patterns can form where the slower neurons lock to sub harmonics of faster neurons . in this case",
    "a large set of coexistent patterns exist  @xcite .",
    "we have examined the existence and stability of phased - lock solutions in a network of neurons with heterogeneous intrinsic frequency . with mild heterogeneity , we have shown that stable phase - locking is possible but it is fairly fragile .",
    "when periodic phase - locking breaks , states of asynchrony , harmonic locking or suppression may arise . in accordance with previous work  @xcite , we have found that phase - locking tendencies are strongly determined by the type ( i or ii ) of the neuron model .",
    "we also distinguish between saturating and nonsaturating synaptic types and find that there can be differences in phase - locking properties . neurons with saturating synapses",
    "tolerate the effects of heterogeneity better .",
    "our analysis may clarify some of the apparent differences in previously derived conditions for synchronization with inhibition .",
    "we find that stable synchrony requires a nonzero rise time of the synaptic current as emphasized in refs .",
    "this was implicitly assumed in ref .",
    "we also find that it requires that the rise time not be too slow which was emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite and assumed in ref .",
    ". however , ref .",
    "@xcite also requires that the synaptic decay time not be too fast which was also observed in numerical simulations in ref .",
    ". this condition may be implicit in the behavior of the kernels .",
    "for some neuron models , the @xmath51 kernel may become negative if the synaptic decay time becomes too fast .",
    "for example , if the threshold of the integrate - and - fire model changes with the synapse then this condition may be present  @xcite .",
    "our results rely on the spike response method to characterize the dynamics of a threshold crossing variable in terms of a set of response kernels .",
    "the existence and stability of phase - locked solutions are then established by the time courses of these kernels .",
    "critical to our analysis is that the kernels exist and can be computed . for the integrate - and - fire model the kernels can be obtained explicitly . for more complicated models",
    ", they most likely must be obtained numerically  @xcite .",
    "however , we can still infer general properties on how they should behave .",
    "the neuron type ( i or ii ) governs the general characteristics of the synaptic kernels .",
    "for example , positive inputs always advance the firing of type i neurons .",
    "this implies that the synaptic kernel always remains positive . as noted previously",
    "@xcite , we find that type i and type ii synapses will greatly affect the phase - locking tendencies of the neurons . our formalism shows why this is the case from the shapes of the synaptic kernels . it should be noted that the expansion into kernels is not always guaranteed . in particular , the separation of a membrane kernel from a synaptic kernel may not always be possible if the neuron is strongly nonlinear .",
    "in such a case , an integral approximation can still to be obtained and linearizations around phase - locked solutions may be possible to examine stability .",
    "we emphasize that we have computed the local stability of the states .",
    "this is in contrast to previous strategies where the global stability is computed  @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the class of initial conditions that will approach a synchronous solution is found .",
    "an absorption criterion is used that assumes that once the oscillators are within a given phase of each other then they remain locked and no longer influence each other . in our formulation ,",
    "the synaptic coupling can still influence locked neurons and be enough to destabilize the dynamics if certain other criteria are not met . in the case of excitatory coupling",
    ", we find that although oscillators may approach each other globally they may not be locally stable .",
    "it had been previously assumed that the reasons for disparate results for the stability of synchronized pulse - coupled integrate - and - fire oscillators were a result of the singular nature of the delta - distribution synaptic coupling  @xcite .",
    "however , it is the assumptions regarding what constitutes a locked state that separates the conclusions .",
    "ideally , a combined analysis should be done where a global stability analysis is used to examine the class of initial conditions that approach a phase - locked solution and then a local stability analysis is performed to see if the locked state is sustainable .",
    "we only considered heterogeneity in the applied currents which is a very simple form of disorder because it is not necessary to average over different instances of the heterogeneity .",
    "for instance if we choose @xmath0 random current values from a fixed probability distribution and if @xmath0 is large enough , then a single instance is equivalent to any other instance .",
    "this is because the network is insensitive to rearrangements of the current values between the neurons .",
    "we can always relabel the neurons in the network .",
    "only the distribution of the gaps between current values are important and this is fixed for large enough @xmath0 .",
    "this property allowed us to gain insight into the @xmath0 neuron network from the two neuron network . on the other hand",
    "if the heterogeneity were to be included in the coupling strengths then a single instance of the heterogeneity may not give an accurate picture of what a typical random network will do .",
    "a rearrangement of the coupling strengths could greatly affect the network dynamics . here",
    ", an understanding of two heterogeneously coupled neurons may not give any insight into the behavior of a large network .",
    "one must average over the heterogeneity to get an idea of what a typical network will do . then one must probe the fluctuations around this average . for two neurons it seems that heterogeneity for synaptic strengths would have similar results to what we derived for heterogeneity in the applied current .",
    "phase - locked solutions would be shifted away from the homogeneous solutions .",
    "our stability results would then apply analogously .",
    "however , the behavior of large networks may be quite different from the behavior of two neurons .",
