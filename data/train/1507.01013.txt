    "various mechanisms , including ion and electron collisional collection and resulting secondary emission of ions or electrons , contribute to the charging of a dust grain in a plasma . since the collision of plasma particles with the grain occurs at random times , the net electric charge possessed by",
    "the grain fluctuates in time even if the plasma parameters such as temperature and number densities are fixed .",
    "this kind of fluctuations , which take place in systems with discrete particles , are known as _ intrinsic noise _ @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic noise can not be switched off as it is inherent in the actual physical mechanism , e.g. , electron or ion electron collision or emission in grain charging mechanism , which is responsible for the evolution of the system .",
    "intrinsic charge fluctuations refer to random variation of the grain charge by this intrinsic noise .",
    "description of intrinsic charge fluctuations of grains was the subject of a number of studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the fluctuations through a monte carlo approach and concluded that they are more important for smaller grains .",
    "the grain charge is correlated with the grain size so this conclusion is consistent with that the net elementary charge @xmath0 possessed by the grain should have fluctuations with @xmath1 , which suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed that the fluctuating charge of small grains could experience positive values .",
    "it is known that the grain mean charge at equilibrium is negative because in an average sense , the grain collects mobile electrons more than ions , as it approaches to an equilibrium charge .",
    "@xcite proposed a one - step process master equation  @xcite for the grain charge density function , then derived a fokker - planck equation for it and showed that if the condition @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the radius of the grain and @xmath4 is the electron temperature , is satisfied , the charge distribution at stationary states is gaussian with an average and variance correlated to the ion and electron currents to the grain . defining the system size as @xmath5",
    ", @xcite derived a gaussian solution at non - stationary states for the fokker - planck equation formulated through the system size expansion of the master equation @xcite . in the non - stationary state gaussian solution , the rate of the mean grain charge correlates with the rate of charge to the net current .",
    "this mean equation is the macroscopic equation @xcite of the grain charging system , and it is the same equation widely used for the grain charging with negligible fluctuations , which is the conservation of the grain charge .",
    "the rate of the grain charge variance is correlated with the currents and their derivatives evaluated at the charge mean . @xcite",
    "lately extended this model to include multi - component plasmas where there are various kinds of singly- or multiply - charged negative or positive ions and showed that the grain charge distribution still follows gaussianity when @xmath6 is sufficiently large .",
    "in all the references discussed above , collisional collections of electrons and ions were the only mechanism of charging .",
    "@xcite obtained an analytical solution for the pdf at stationary states for a master equation that included the effect of the electron detachment , e.g. , secondary electron emission ( see ) , assuming that the grain charge does not experience positive values , i.e , a half - infinite range assumption @xmath7 .",
    "this kind stationary - state solution is unique for the master equation of a general one - step process with a half - infinite or finite range of the variable whereas it is not unique for a range consisting of all integers @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite formulated an improved version of the master equation that they had originally proposed @xcite , relaxed the half - infinite range assumption , and derived an approximate analytical solution for the pdf at the stationary state .",
    "this approximation is not well justified for grains where the pdf varies substantially over a small range of charges .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of thermionic emission and uv irradiation , separately , while electron collisional collection was present .",
    "they concluded that @xmath1 is valid for these situations as well . lately , @xcite studied the fluctuations in multi - component plasma through a population balance equation resembling the master equation .",
    "they also included the influence of photoemission from dust through irradiation by laser light in their study .",
    "it is noted that all above but @xcite used markov approaches to describe grain charge fluctuations .",
    "the most well known effect of see on grain charging is a bifurcation phenomenon : two identical grains in an identical plasma environment may have two different stable charge values , one positive and one negative @xcite .",
    "thus , a small variation in the parameters may cause a rapid change from one equilibrium charge to another .",
    "interestingly , @xcite showed that in the spacecraft charging , the bifurcation phenomena caused by see could involve three stable equilibrium charge values .",
    "the experimental study of @xcite on charging of grains with energetic electrons that resulted in secondary electron emission , showed the distribution of grain charge could be bimodal .",
    "however , they asserted that the lack of a unique value may be due to fluctuations in the plasma parameters or small differences in the grains .",
    "the current study is on the influence of see on grain charge intrinsic fluctuations with a focus on bistability .",
    "bistability occurs in stochatic systems with two stable macrostates @xcite .",
    "the bistability of the grain charging system is associated with the bifurication phenomena described above .",
    "the fluctuations in a bistable system may be metastable @xcite , where the fluctuations are at one macrostate for a while and at a random time , a passage to the other macrostate takes place and at a random time , the system returns to the first macrostate and this cycle continues . whether grain charge fluctuations could be metastable",
    "is investigated in this work . in section [ sec : mathemticalformulation ] , first , a master equation describing the fluctuations of the grain charge in the presence of see mechanism is presented , and then currents of ions , primary electrons and secondary electrons of a maxwellian plasma and a non - maxwellian plasma are shown . in section [ sec : results ] , results are shown and discussed .",
    "conclusions are made in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "assuming that the charging of the grain undergoes a markov process , the following master equation can be formulated for the probability density function of the grain charge @xmath8 :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is an operator defined by @xmath11 for any integer number @xmath12 , @xmath13 indicates the number of secondary electrons emitted from the grain upon the impact of one primary electron , @xmath14 is the maximum number of secondary electrons that can be emitted , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the currents of ions and primary electrons to the grain , respectively , and @xmath17 is the probability distribution of emission of @xmath13 electrons in a single incident of a primary impact , i.e. , the fraction of primary electrons that result in the emission of @xmath13 secondary electrons in one single attachment incident .",
    "hence , the rate of the attachment of the primary electrons that do not cause secondary emission is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 indicate the rate of the attachment of the primary electrons that cause the emission of @xmath13 secondary electrons in one incident . the jump process associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : onestepmaster ] ) is regarded to that the attachment of a primary electron to the grain causes the emission of @xmath13 secondary electrons ; thus the net change of the grain charge is @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath21 , the charge of the grain at time @xmath22 , jumps to @xmath23 .",
    "it is noted that the master equation of @xcite is a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : onestepmaster ] ) with @xmath24 .",
    "also , two following special cases of the master equation  ( [ eq : onestepmaster ] ) regarded as one - step processes are worth noting :    * @xmath25 , which corresponds to a case where no see occurs , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 . in this case , the second term on the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ eq : onestepmaster ] ) can be derived through the system size expansion method  @xcite :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the net current to the grain , and @xmath39 is the see current to the grain . a solution of the macroscopic eq .  ( [ eq : macrostate ] ) is a time - dependent macrostate of the grain charging system while the solution of @xmath40 is a stationary macrostate of the system  @xcite .",
    "@xcite classifies the stable , bistable , and unstable stochastic systems through @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : macrostate ] ) : a stochastic system is stable when @xmath42 where @xmath43 ; it is bistable when there are two stable stationary macrostates , i.e. , there are two solutions for @xmath40 and at the vicinities of them , @xmath42 holds ; and it is unstable when @xmath44 .",
    "the bistability classification here is in harmony with the bifurcation phenomenon based on the roots of the net current , which is reviewed in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] .",
    "in other words , having neglected the fluctuations of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath45 , one obtains @xmath46 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : macrostate ] ) is readily simplified to @xmath47 , which can be used to find the time evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "if an initial @xmath0 is within the domain of attraction of a stable root of @xmath48 , then @xmath0 approaches it at the stationary state when there are no fluctuations .",
    "each root is associated with one stationary macrostate of the system and the system stability defined above can be likewise determined through the sign of @xmath49 . when the fluctuations of the grain charge are taken into account",
    ", there is a probability for a fluctuation to carry the charge from the domain of attraction of one root to another .",
    "this situation is investigated in next section .",
    "the see current is correlated with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and this correlation is found through the mean secondary electron yield defined by    @xmath50    in addition , @xmath51 is correlated with @xmath17 through the definition of the mean @xmath52 .",

    "the summation terms in this equation are zero .",
    "it is noted that @xmath66 is the electron net current to the grain so the charging process here is modeled as each primary electron impact incident causing no or one secondary electron emission at most . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : binomial ] ) , a sufficient condition for the positivity of @xmath17 is @xmath67 , which is equivalent to @xmath68 this inequality sets the requirement for the minimum @xmath14 according to variation of @xmath51 versus @xmath0 .",
    "following @xcite , who investigated the bifurcation phenomena associated with see , both maxwellian and non - maxwellian plasmas are considered here :    for maxwellian plasmas , it can be shown @xcite    @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the number density and temperature of ions , respectively .",

    "a master equation was formulated to include the effect of secondary electron emission in addition to collisional attachment of ions and electrons on the intrinsic charge fluctuations of a grain .",
    "grain charging in both maxwellian and non - maxwellian plasmas were considered . in both plasmas , the fluctuations could be bistable , as the system could have two stable macrostates . in the absence of see mechanism ,",
    "the bistabillity is not possible as the system always have a single macrostate .",
    "it was shown that if the system is bistable , the grain charge can be metastable .",

    "a switch from the macrostate associated with the negative stable root of the net current to the macrostate associate with the positive stable root of the net current is attributed to a sequence of incidents almost all of which increase the grain charge by one or two elementary charge . on the other hand ,",
