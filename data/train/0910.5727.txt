    "long duration gamma - ray bursts ( grb )  those lasting more than 2 s  are thought to be produced by a relativistic outflow ( or jet ) with a kinetic energy @xmath7 erg ( beaming effect corrected ) when a massive star collapses at the end of its nuclear burning life cycle ( see piran 1999 , 2005 ; mszros 2002 for reviews ) . the massive star origin of grbs are supported by two different observations : ( i ) grbs are found to be in actively star forming galaxies ( e.g. , christensen et al .",
    "2004 , castro cern et al . 2006 ) or in star ( especially massive ones ) forming regions of the host galaxies ( e.g. , paczyski 1998 ; bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2002 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ) ; ( ii ) for a subset of nearly a dozen of grbs , x - ray - rich grbs and x - ray flashes , supernova ( sna ) features  both temporally and spacially associated with the bursts ( woosley & bloom 2006 for a review )  were detected . for four of those : grb 980425 ( e.g. , galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , 030329 ( e.g. , hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ) , 021211 ( della valle et al .",
    "2003 ) and 031203 ( e.g. , malesani et al . , 2004 ) , the physically associated sne were not only photometrically but also spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "the others of the subset show a late - time ( @xmath8 10 days ) sna - like `` bump '' in the optical afterglows , with a simultaneous strong color evolution , e.g. , in grb 980326 ( bloom et al . 1999 ) and 011121 ( bloom et al .",
    "2002 ) , consistent with the hypothesis of an underlying sna .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite has recently unveiled a `` canonical '' behavior pattern in about two - thirds of grbs early x - ray afterglows : a rapid decline phase lasting for @xmath9 s is followed by a shallow decay phase lasting @xmath10 s , then by a `` normal '' power - law decay phase and finally by a possible jet break ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "in addition , x - ray flares are found in about 50% of all _ swift _ bursts ; they have been discovered in all of the above phases ( burrows et al . 2005 , 2007 ; chincarini et al .",
    "even long before _ swift _ , a late x - ray flare was detected by bepposax for grb 970508 ( piro et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in this work",
    "we investigate a scenario in which a late jet  responsible for producing the x - ray flares and possibly the shallow decay phase  interacts with other components of a long - grb stellar explosion .",
    "these components include a sna ejecta , if a sna explosion is accompanying the grb event , and a cocoon created by the passage of the main grb jet through the star ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 , matzner 2003 , zhang et al . 2004 ) .    in section [ sec : mul - com ]",
    "we argue for the existence of the late jet and multiple components of a grb explosion , and provide physical motivations of this work .",
    "we investigate the interactions of the late jet with the sna ejecta in section [ sec : jet - ejecta ] and with the cocoon in section [ sec : jet - cocoon ] and calculate their associated emissions .",
    "the predicted emissions and their detection prospects are confronted with current observational data in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the summary and implications are given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "two recently discovered grb features point to the emergence of a late outflow ( jet ) after the main @xmath11-ray producing outflow has died .",
    "the first is the x - ray flares observed at a few @xmath12 s ( as late as 10@xmath13 s in some cases ) after the prompt burst , with a fluence typically about one tenth of the fluence of the prompt @xmath11-rays ; in one case , grb 050502b , this ratio is @xmath8 1 ( falcone et al .",
    "lazzati , perna & begelman ( 2008 ) found that the mean flux of a flare declines with its occurrence time as @xmath14 .",
    "these flares are characterized by a large flux increase and by a very steep rise and decay .",
    "typical increase of the flux ranges from a factor of order unity to 10 and in some rare cases even a few hundred . the decay after the flare peak is as steep as @xmath15 , much steeper than the underlying afterglow decay ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the pulse width to the peak time ratio @xmath17 is much smaller than unity , typically @xmath18 ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ; chincarini et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the late flares can not be due to external - origin mechanisms such as , a density clump in the circumburst medium , or the energy injection into the afterglow blastwave by the trailing slower shells , because the decay slope after the rebrightening from these mechanisms always follows the standard afterglow model , and @xmath19 is always expected ( nakar , piran & granot 2003 ; nakar & granot 2007 ; lazzati & perna 2007 ) .",
    "they are also unlikely to arise from late collisions between two slow moving shells ejected at same time as the main @xmath11-ray producing shells , since the resultant internal shock is too weak to give rise to the significant emission observed in flares ( zhang 2006 ) .",
    "the most likely possibility for x - ray flares is the late activity of the central engine ( e.g. , fan & wei 2005 ) .",
    "such a late activity was proposed already in 1998 as an alternative origin of grb afterglow ( katz & piran 1998 , katz , piran & sari 1998 ) .",
    "the scenario involving the late engine activity can easily satisfy the constraint that @xmath20 .",
    "also in this scenario the late flare is physically separate from the `` background '' afterglow , so the large amplitude increase of the flux superposed on the decaying afterglow can be naturally explained .",
    "the second feature favoring the existence of a late jet is the shallowly decaying component in the overall x - ray light curve .",
    "this component starts at a few @xmath12 s and ends at @xmath21 s during which the flux decays slower than expected for standard decelerating blast - wave afterglow .",
    "one straightforward interpretation is that the shallowness is due to an long - lasting energy injection from a late outflow that catches up with the decelerated main outflow ( cohen & piran 1999 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; yu & dai 2007 ) , though there are other possible interpretations for this feature ( e.g. , granot & kumar 2006 ; granot , knigl & piran 2006 ; fan & piran 2006 , panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; kobayashi & zhang 2007 ; uhm & beloborodov 2007 ; genet et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in those cases where we do nt see a sna spectroscopically or photometrically in the optical band ,",
    "we can still hope to explore the existence and properties of the sna accompanying the grb by looking at the interaction of a late jet with the sna remnant and the emission from it .",
    "it is likely that every long - duration grb has a sna accompanying it but some extrinsic and/or intrinsic bias might have hindered the optical detection of the sna component(woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "a late jet provides a chance to test this picture in the cases where the ordinary sna features are not easy to detect .    given the evidences for the existence of a late jet and the physical association of sne and grbs ,",
    "one expects a number of different interactions between the following four components in a grb event ( see fig . [",
    "fig : jet - illus ] for an illustration ) : ( i ) a highly relativistic ( @xmath22 ) narrow jet along the rotation axis with an opening angle @xmath8 0.1 radian that produces the main grb event ; ( ii ) a nearly spherically symmetric sna ejecta moving with speed @xmath23 km s@xmath1 ; ( iii ) a cocoon fireball created by the passage of the main grb jet through the star ;",
    "( iv ) a late relativistic jet responsible for the late x - ray flares after the end of the main grb .",
    "see woosley & heger ( 2006 ) for a detailed version of the multi - component grb scenario . also see wheeler et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a similar but more detailed model which relates various energetic phenomena such as sna , grb and magnetar in a single stellar explosion .    in this work",
    "we investigate the interactions of a late jet which might have a similar lorentz factor and opening angle to those of the main grb jet , with the expanding sna ejecta and the cocoon .",
    "we assume that the sna ejecta and the main grb jet are launched from the central source at about the same time . 1 day ( e.g. , woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "sna explosion theories estimate that the sna shock breaks out at a few tens of seconds after the core rebounce ( e.g. , janka et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) ; this time scale is small compared to the delay of the late jet ( @xmath24 s ) . ]",
    "wheeler et al . ( 2002 ) described a similar stellar collapsing scenario where a delayed relativistic jet from the eventually formed black hole catches up and collides with an earlier proto - pulsar toroidal field generated mildly relativistic jet as an origin of the @xmath11-ray burst .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) firstly considered the collision between a jetted fireball from an intermittent grb central engine and a stationary cocoon as an alternative to the standard internal shock scenario , but with higher efficiency .",
    "here we are not attempting to explain how a relativistic jet is formed and a @xmath11-ray burst is produced from the relativistic jet or how an accompanying sna is generated , rather we are trying to constrain the physical properties of the late jet , sna ejecta and the cocoon by calculating the emissions from their interactions , and to verify the general picture of grb - sna connection .",
    "we will use the following fiducial values for a variety of model parameters . for the late jet , a total energy @xmath25 erg , opening angle @xmath26 0.1 radian ,",
    "lf @xmath27 100 , a delay respective to the launching of the main grb jet , cocoon and sna ejecta ( in our picture the three are launched at more or less the same time ) @xmath28 s , and a duration @xmath29 s ; for the sna ejecta , we use an isotropic - equivalent mass @xmath30 10 @xmath31 and speed @xmath32 cm s@xmath1 ; for the cocoon , we use an energy @xmath33 erg , a terminal lf @xmath34 10 and an opening angle @xmath35 0.6 radian .",
    "nevertheless an appropriate range of numerical values is assigned to each parameter in the real calculation ( e.g. , @xmath36 could be two orders of magnitude larger or smaller than the fiducial one , cocoon speed could be sub - relativistic and @xmath37 could be as large as @xmath21 s ) .",
    "the late jet will run into the sna ejecta first ( at a distance @xmath38 cm ; see fig . [",
    "fig : interact - illus]a ) , and then catches up and run into the cocoon  if it successfully crosses the ejecta  at a larger distance ( @xmath39 cm ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : interact - illus]b ) .        .",
    "the breakout of the `` late '' cocoon produces a short thermal emission lasting for @xmath2 s. * ( b ) * : schematic illustration of the late jet - cocoon interaction , at a somewhat later time than in ( a ) , when the late jet has completely emerged out of the sna ejecta and is colliding with the cocoon created by the main grb jet as it made its way through the progenitor star .",

    "note that the `` late '' cocoon has expanded and cooled down at this time.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] + * ( b ) * +",
    "since the late jet is highly relativistic and the sna ejecta is sub - relativistic , the late jet will catch up with the sna ejecta in a time roughly equal to the distance of the sna ejecta from the explosion center ( where the jet emerged ) , @xmath40 , divided by light speed @xmath41 . if the late jet is launched with a delay of @xmath37 , then @xmath42 cm ( hereafter we use the convention @xmath43 unless specifically notified ) . at this time",
    "the radial width of the ejecta is about the same size of the initial stellar envelope , @xmath44 cm .",
    "the ejecta has hardly moved from the initial position of the progenitor stellar envelope for a jet delay @xmath45 s. the particle density in the sna ejecta is @xmath46 @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is in units of the solar mass , and it is extremely optically thick . if there is any emission from the interaction between the late jet and the sn ejecta , that emission should be thermal .",
    "we recall that the main grb jet has already traversed the star and left a cavity in the polar region before the late jet comes . since the material enclosing the `` wall '' of the cavity was heated up by the passage of the main jet , it has tendency to refill the cavity . to find out whether the cavity in the sna ejecta has been filled up before the late - jet encounter",
    ", we estimate the time it takes for filling up the cavity .    when inside the star , the cocoon material has a relativistic temperature , i.e. , the local sound speed @xmath49 .",
    "thus the cocoon material may fill the cavity on a time scale of @xmath50 1 s , much shorter than the onset of the late jet @xmath37 .",
    "however the cocoon will also break out and flow away from the ejecta at that same speed in @xmath8 10 s , leaving behind a somewhat evacuated polar region .",
    "the filling of the polar cavity by the rest of the sn ejecta is uncertain .",
    "assuming a temperature @xmath51 k for the sna - shocked ejecta material , it has @xmath52 cm s@xmath1 , so the filling time would be @xmath53 s , comparable to @xmath37 . considering that the ejecta local temperature possibly decreases from inner parts to outer parts and the transverse size of the cavity gets bigger outward ,",
    "it is likely that when the late jet hits the ejecta the cavity is partly filled  the inner part is filled but the outer part is not . however , for a very late jet , e.g. , @xmath54 s , the cavity is surely filled before the late jet comes up ; and then the question that arises is whether the jet is powerful enough to cross the new refilled cavity .",
    "this issue will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the late jet comoving particle density is @xmath55 @xmath47 , where @xmath56 is the late jet luminosity . because @xmath57 , the late jet will be decelerated to a non - relativistic speed after it first hits the ejecta .",
    "it will undergo the same process as the grb main jet did when propagating through the progenitor star .",
    "a cocoon forms in the sna ejecta and makes a way for the jet head by pushing the ejecta material sideways . to distinguish it from the cocoon associated with the main grb jet ,",
    "let us call this cocoon associated with the late jet as the `` late cocoon '' ( see in figs .",
    "[ fig : jet - illus ] and [ fig : interact - illus]a ) .",
    "when the jet is moving inside the ejecta , the jet head has been slowed down to be at a sub - relativistic speed ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; matzner 2003 ) : @xmath58 @xmath59 note that if the sna ejecta width is constant then @xmath60 has no dependence on @xmath40 and therefore on @xmath37 ; but if the sna ejecta is uniformly distributed from the centre to the radius @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath61 , then @xmath60 increases with @xmath37 as @xmath62 .",
    "sna explosion simulations show the latter case , i.e. , @xmath61 , is the most probable one ( e.g. , tanaka et al . 2009 ) .    a constraint on the late jet property can be derived from the requirement that the duration @xmath63 of the jet must be larger than the time that the jet spends to cross the sna ejecta .",
    "thus @xmath64 implies @xmath65 .      the late cocoon  formed by the interaction of late jet with sna ejecta .",
    "]  will break out of the star immediately following the breakout of head of the late jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interact - illus]a ) .",
    "the luminosity of the thermal emission from the late cocoon breakout can be estimated from its temperature and transverse size .",
    "prior to its breakout , the late cocoon has a pressure @xmath66 and its leading head moves with the jet head at the same speed in the radial direction and expands transversely into the sna ejecta with a speed @xmath67 .",
    "the ram pressure balance at the lateral interface between the late cocoon and the ejecta material gives @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the ejecta mass density .",
    "the late cocoon contains an energy @xmath70 that is approximately equal to the jet luminosity @xmath56 times the shell crossing time @xmath71 , and it is radiation pressure dominated . the volume of the late cocoon just before the breakout is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the transverse size .",
    "so the pressure is @xmath74 combining with eq .",
    "( [ eq : p - lat ] ) gives @xmath75 and the thermal temperature is @xmath76 @xmath77 where eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_h ] ) is used . for a late jet with @xmath28 s",
    ", the typical thermal photon energy should be a few kev .",
    "@xmath78 becomes smaller for larger @xmath37 ; for instance , when the sn ejecta width @xmath79 is @xmath80 and , if @xmath81 ( lazzati et al . 2008 ) , we have @xmath82 .",
    "let us estimate the luminosity of the thermal emission from the late cocoon breakout .",
    "the late cocoon transverse expansion speed is @xmath83 @xmath84 the cocoon transverse size is @xmath85 notice that @xmath86 is almost @xmath87 for fiducial parameter values .",
    "however , the transverse size of the visible emitting region of the cocoon just at the breakout should be smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "this is because when the jet head moves near the outer surface of the ejecta , it probably accelerates due to the rapid density drop of the stellar materia there ; thus the lateral expansion of the cocoon s leading head immediately following the jet head should be suppressed .",
    "therefore at that time , the overall cocoon might be in an `` hourglass '' shape , as illustrated in ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and in our fig .",
    "[ fig : interact - illus]a , rather than a conic shape . at the breakout ,",
    "the hot cocoon material escapes and accelerates radially from a `` nozzle '' which has a transverse size on the same order of the jet s .",
    "thus , the transverse size of the visible emitting cocoon right at the breakout can be estimated as @xmath88 cm , while @xmath86 should be the transverse size of cocoon at its _ widest _ cross section .",
    "the luminosity of the black body radiation is @xmath89 @xmath90 using the fact that @xmath81 , one can find this thermal luminosity decreases with @xmath37 as @xmath91 if @xmath92 , or as @xmath93 if @xmath94 constant .",
    "thus , the radiation efficiency increases as @xmath95 for @xmath92 and as @xmath96 for @xmath94 constant , respectively , which is simply because the emitting transverse area increases with @xmath37 .",
    "this thermal transient will last for a time comparable to the time it takes for the bulk of the late cocoon to escape the ejecta .",
    "after that , the luminosity drops quickly due to adiabatic cooling .",
    "the late cocoon s outflow speed is @xmath97 , so the escape time is @xmath98 s. note that @xmath99 is large because all the jet power was deposited in the cocoon over a relatively long time ( ejecta crossing time @xmath9 s ) , and this energy is efficiently radiated away ( via black body radiation ) within a relatively short time , @xmath100 s.    an even stronger ( @xmath101 erg s@xmath1 ) thermal pulse is associated with the main grb jet break out .",
    "however , this thermal transient is short ( @xmath8 10 s ) , with spectral peak at x - rays , and it happens during the initial stage of the main `` burst '' @xmath11-ray emission when the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) is not pointing towards the burst . since this emission can be estimated to be one to two orders of magnitude dimmer than the emission of the burst itself , it is difficult to observe . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal transient due to the late cocoon breakout that we consider here arises later and at the time that the xrt is already pointing towards the burst .",
    "hence this transient should be easier to detect .",
    "the fact that we do nt observe such thermal transient , preceding flares during the afterglow is somewhat puzzling .",
    "if the late jet is fairly early ( say , @xmath102 s ) , the polar cavity in the sna ejecta left by the main grb jet was probably only partially filled , i.e. , only the inner part of the cavity is filled ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cavity - ejecta ] ) . in that case",
    ", the luminosity of the thermal emission would be much smaller than what we estimated above .",
    "the situation is more problematic for @xmath103 .",
    "we discuss further the observational prospects of this transient in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs - jet - sn ] .",
    "we now turn to the interaction of the late jet , after it has successfully crossed the sna ejecta , with the cocoon that was formed by the main grb jet ( see fig .",

    "the cocoon breaks out from the star at the same time when the main jet breaks out .",
    "then it accelerates to a mildly relativistic speed .",
    "the delay of the late jet with respect to the cocoon breakout is @xmath37 and the late jet catches up with the adiabatically cooled cocoon at @xmath104 , where @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) are the speed ( lfs ) of the late jet and the cocoon , respectively . when the cocoon speed is mildly relativistic , @xmath109 cm , which is much further than the late jet - sna ejecta interaction site . for a sub - relativistic cocoon",
    ", @xmath110 is close to but still outside the jet - sna ejecta interaction region .      at the breakout",
    ", the cocoon has an energy @xmath70 , and an energy - to - mass ratio @xmath111 .",
    "the cocoon opening angle @xmath112 is determined by its transverse expansion speed @xmath113 , thus @xmath114 . during the early stages of expansion ,",
    "the cocoon s radial width , @xmath115 , is approximately the width of the stellar envelope @xmath116 .",
    "later on , due to the radial expansion of a relativistically moving gas , @xmath117 asymptotically approaches @xmath118 in the lab frame ; this happens when @xmath119 .",
    "the cocoon s lf can be described as @xmath120 when @xmath121 , and @xmath122 when @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the saturation radius ( paczyski 1986 ; goodman 1986 ; shemi & piran 1990 ; piran , shemi & narayan 1993 ; mszros , laguna & rees 1993 ) .",
    "the evolution of the cocoon s comoving volume , @xmath125 , is described by @xmath126    the pressure evolution of the cocoon follows the adiabatic expansion law : @xmath127 .",
    "initially the radiation pressure dominates , so @xmath128 .",
    "when the cocoon s optical depth to thomson scattering decreases to below unity , the photons decouple from the matter and the radiation pressure drops exponentially ; then the gas pressure takes over the dominance of the pressure with @xmath129 .",
    "the transition happens at radius @xmath130^{1/2 } = 3.5\\times10^{14 } e_{c,51}^{1/2 } \\et_{c,1}^{-1/2}$ ] cm , where @xmath131 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "the initial pressure at the breakout is given by @xmath132 the evolution of the cocoon pressure is thus given by @xmath133    the comoving density of the cocoon is assumed to be homogeneous ; the same is for the late jet .",
    "the width of the late jet is determined by its duration and the radial expansion , so @xmath134 .",
    "the jet comoving density is @xmath135      there was also initially a cavity in the cocoon left by the passage of the main jet .",
    "here we estimate how quickly the cavity would be filled .",
    "the filling up process starts when the main jet dies off . for a typical duration of grb @xmath136 s ,",
    "the cocoon has moved to a radius @xmath137 cm . since @xmath138 , the cocoon gas is still relativistic , the sound speed is @xmath139 , and the time required for cavity to close is @xmath140 s which is @xmath141 .",
    "thus the cavity is securely filled when the late jet reaches the cocoon .",
    "now let us consider a possibility that there is a continuous low - level central engine activity ( a _ low - power _ jet ) following the end of the main grb jet and preceding the late jet .",
    "this low - power jet and the late jet more or less are the same phenomenon , only with different energy fluxes .",
    "the low - power jet might have too small radiation luminosity to have an observational imprint , however it might still be dynamically important for keeping open the polar cavity in the sna ejecta and the cocoon .    to keep the cavity open without significant energy dissipation from the jet and cocoon , the transverse pressure , i.e. , the thermal pressure , of the low - power jet should be greater than or equal to the cocoon s pressure at @xmath142 .",
    "though the low - power jet started with a high thermal pressure at a distance @xmath143 km from the explosion centre where it was launched , at @xmath142 its thermal pressure has dropped to be much smaller than the cocoon pressure because it has adiabatically expanded by a much larger factor than the cocoon does .",
    "thus , when this low - power jet entered the cavity left by the main grb jet , it will be squashed rapidly by the gas pressure in the cocoon .",
    "the ram pressure of the low power jet , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the jet luminosity , can help bore a cavity through the cocoon under suitable conditions . for a long - lasting , continuous jet ,",
    "the event that takes place after it has been squashed is as follows .",
    "if @xmath146 , then the residual , incoming jet will punch a new channel through the cocoon . in doing this , the jet is heated up by the reverse shock , so that the jet which is moving inside the channel could have an enhanced @xmath147 ( thermal pressure ) that is comparable to @xmath66 , and can keep the channel open . if we assume the low - power jet was launched at the end of the grb , i.e. , @xmath148 s , making the equality @xmath149 gives @xmath150 erg s@xmath1 , with other parameters at fiducial values .",
    "the same equality at later times gives the time dependence @xmath151 .",
    "so a decaying luminosity profile @xmath152 erg s@xmath1 for the low - power jet is required to keep the cavity open , i.e. , the minimum required total energy for a low - power jet to keep the cavity open is a few @xmath153 erg .",
    "note that at this minimal jet luminosity , the process of keeping the cavity open is _ not _ smooth and a fraction of jet energy is dissipated and it should have some radiation associated with it .    in conclusion , the polar cavity left by the main grb jet in the cocoon can fill up quickly  before the late jet reaches the cocoon .",
    "the presence of a continuous low - power jet can keep this cavity open , provided that the jet has a minimal total energy of a few @xmath153 erg . in the following calculation we consider the case when the cavity is filled up .",
    "clearly if the cavity is empty the late jet cocoon interaction is trivial .",
    "a schematic sketch of light curves due to emission from the late jet - cocoon interaction , superposed on the underlying external - shock afterglow component , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc - illus ] .",
    "the expected emission from late jet - cocoon interaction has the following features :    \\(1 ) _ peak flux density_. the peak flux has a broad distribution ( see fig . [",
    "fig : flux - peak ] ) . except for the cases of a very slow cocoon or a very low jet - to - cocoon energy ratio , the emission is fairly bright .",
    "for instance , the range of the calculated x - ray peak flux densities corresponds to a flux in the 0.310 kev band of @xmath336 erg s@xmath1 @xmath337 ( for a spectral index @xmath338 ) while the swfit / xrt sensitivity is @xmath339 erg s@xmath1 @xmath337 in @xmath340 s ( gehrels et al .",

    "we find that late jet - sna ejecta interaction produces a thermal transient due to the breakout of a `` late '' cocoon produced by the late jet crossing the sna ejecta .",

    ", spectral fit shows no compelling evidence for a thermal component ( falcone et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the non - detection of a thermal x - ray transient in grbs with flares indicates that the late jet - sna ejecta interaction is weak or non- existent .",
    "there are three possible reasons for the non - detection : ( i ) the cavity in the polar region of the progenitor star created by the main grb jet is still open , and in that case the interaction between the late jet and the partially filled cavity is weak resulting in a significantly lower signal than we have estimated in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - emi ] . the cavity can be kept open , either because the time was too short for the cavity to fill up , or due to a continuous , low - power jet that precedes the late jet .",
    "this low - power jet might also keep the cavity in the cocoon open ( see section [ sec : cavity - cocoon ] ) .",
    "( ii ) the cocoon that is in front of the `` late '' cocoon and the late jet could be optical thick , e.g. , @xmath335 ( also see figs . [",
    "fig : tau_e ] - [ fig : tau_fs ] ) , and block the thermal transient signal .",
    "( iii ) it is also possible that even though the grb was associated with the death of a massive star the stellar envelope collapsed producing no supernova at all . in the failed sn explosion the whole stellar envelope would collapse on a free - fall time scale of a couple of hundred seconds ( see , e.g. , kumar , narayan & johnson 2008 ) , form a torus and then be accreted .",
    "note that even in this extreme situation , the cocoon associated with the main jet should still exist because the cocoon is created when the head of the prompt grb jet passes through the stellar envelope , long before the envelope reacts to the core collapse .",
    "observations of x - ray flares in many grb afterglows suggest the existence of a late jet from a long - lived central engine of a grb at @xmath9 s but possibly @xmath346 s after the main grb event . adopting the collapsing massive star origin for long - duration grbs , and assuming that the supernova explosion to be at approximately the same time as the grb",
    ", we have investigated the interactions of this late jet with the sna ejecta and , with a cocoon that was left behind when the main grb jet traversed the progenitor star .",
    "we find that late jet - sna ejecta interaction should produce a thermal transient , lasting about @xmath2 s and with a peak photon energy at a few kev , that should precede or accompany the flare .",
    "the luminosity of this transient is proportional to the kinetic luminosity of the late jet and can be as high as a few @xmath347 erg s@xmath1 . the luminosity is smaller if the polar cavity created by the main grb jet is only partially filled .",
    "this thermal transient is similar to the one associated with the breakout of the main grb jet .",
    "although it has a lower luminosity , its later occurrence makes it easier to detect .",
    "the observation of this signal can provide another evidence for the massive - star origin of grbs and new information on the grb - sna association .",
    "the fact that no such thermal transient was observed so far implies that the late jet - sna ejecta interaction is suppressed .",
    "this could happen if the polar region of the ejecta was evacuated by the main grb jet and cavity has not sufficiently refilled itself , especially for a not - too - late jet , e.g. , @xmath28 s , or the cavity could be kept open by a continuous , low - power jet .",
    "a strong thermal transient signal can also be blocked by the optically thick cocoon , which would be the case if the cocoon is slowly moving .",
    "an alternative possibility is of a failed supernova scenario in which the entire stellar envelope collapses in a free fall time of a few @xmath348 s. in this case there is no supernova associated with the grb and the late jet , if it is late enough , does not have to cross the stellar envelope .",
    "the late jet interaction with the cocoon would cause a flare or rebrightening , superposed on the afterglow light curves , at both the optical and x - ray bands . this flare would have a pulse - width - to - time ratio @xmath349 ( the expected distribution of @xmath17 is similar to that for x - ray flares ) . depending on model parameters ,",
    "we find for a burst at a redshift @xmath350 that the peak flux density at optical @xmath313 ranges from 0.01 @xmath3jy to 0.1 jy ( @xmath351-band apparent magnitude 29 to 11.5 ) and at x - rays @xmath352 ranges from 0.001 @xmath3jy to 1 mjy .",
    "for typical parameters @xmath321 mjy ( @xmath351-band magnitude @xmath353 ) and @xmath322 @xmath3jy .",
    "observational identification of this emission would verify the existence of the cocoon produced when the grb jet traversed the progenitor star , thus it would be another confirmation of the collapsar model for long duration grbs ( e.g. , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; ramirez - ruiz et al . 2002 ; matzner 2003 ; zhang et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the late jet - cocoon interaction might have already been detected in four grb afterglows in which simultaneous x - ray and optical flares with @xmath20 were observed after the prompt emission has died off ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : obs - cand ] ) . from those candidate events",
    ", one can learn about the energetics of late jet and the cocoon by utilizing the emission calculation presented in this paper .",
    "let us consider the flare event in grb 050904 as an example .",
    "we find the most probable model parameters  for this burst at @xmath354 and with @xmath355 s  that produce the observed peak @xmath313 and @xmath352 ( data from bor et al .",
    "2006 ; cusumano et al . 2007 ; gou , fox & mszros 2007 ) to be @xmath356 erg , @xmath357 , @xmath358 erg and @xmath359 .",
    "those high energetics seem consistent with the very luminous nature of both the burst and the flare .",
    "there are three cases in which no optical flare was detected at the time of a strong x - ray flare , even though a number of optical telescopes have been observing these bursts at the time of the x - ray flares ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obs - non - cand ] ) .",
    "this shows that not all x - ray flares are due to the late jet - cocoon interaction .",
    "however , neither a late jet nor the cocoon can be ruled out in these cases .",
    "it is possible that a low - power jet preceding the late jet with a total energy of at least @xmath0 erg had kept the cavity in the cocoon open , so that the late jet - cocoon interaction was suppressed .",
    "if correct this implies a low level continuous emission from the central engine at the level of @xmath360 erg s@xmath1 lasting for @xmath361 s , assuming a radiation efficiency of @xmath315 .",
