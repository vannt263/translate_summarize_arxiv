    "the extent of these disks is not well established but agn unification schemes advocate a geometrically thick or warped thin disk that hides the nucleus when viewed edge - on and accounts for the observed differences between broad ( type 1 ) and narrow - line ( type 2 ) agn .",
    "theoretical work indicates that uv / x - ray radiation from the central engine can heat , ionize and evaporate gas on the inner edge of the torus@xmath7 and recent high angular resolution vlba radio observations of the archetypal seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc  1068 , have shown that emission from the flat - spectrum radio component ` s1 ' may be associated with the thermal gas on the inner , ionized edge of the torus@xmath8 .",
    "this discovery highlights the possibility of using the vlba to image the pc - scale disks or tori in other seyfert galaxies .",
    "flat - spectrum nuclei in radio galaxies and quasars often represent non - thermal synchrotron self - absorbed radio emission with a much higher brightness temperature ( @xmath910@xmath3 k ) than is characteristic of component s1 in ngc 1068 , so high resolution radio observations are required to distinguish between the two emission processes .",
    "four of five sources imaged with the vlba at 8.4 ghz were detected ( figure 1 ) and show compact , unresolved nuclei with brightness temperatures , @xmath11  @xmath9  10@xmath3 k , monochromatic luminosities @xmath010@xmath12 w hz@xmath13 and sizes less than @xmath01  pc . we conclude that the sub - pc scale radio emission in these sources is non - thermal and self absorbed , and hence dominated by the central engine .",
    "we find no significant evidence of thermal disk - like emission extended perpendicular to the collimation axis in these sources .",

    "10@xmath16  k is too low for synchrotron self absorption to be important and we propose a model in which the emission is optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung from a gas with electron temperature of @xmath17  @xmath9  10@xmath18  k and density @xmath19  @xmath9  1.6  @xmath14  10@xmath2  f  @xmath20  @xmath21 ( f is the volume filling factor ) .",
