    "the rigorous attempt to answering the question _ `` how many electrons can a nucleus bind ? '' _",
    "has received substantial attention in the literature over the last decades  @xcite .",
    "so far , the question was only addressed in a time - independent setting , that is , the absence of bound states was shown when the number of electrons in the atom is too large . in the present paper",
    "we shall rigorously formulate and provide an answer to a similar question in the time - dependent setting :  _ `` how many electrons can a nucleus keep in its neighborhood for a long time?''_.    our main purpose is therefore the rigorous understanding of the long - time behavior of atoms .",
    "we shall prove for instance that , in the hartree approximation , a nucleus of charge @xmath4 can not bind in a time - averaged sense more than @xmath1 electrons ( respectively @xmath2 in the radial case ) . in particular , we will recover some of the known time - independent results ( non - existence of bound states ) by different arguments , though .",
    "one key ingredient in our paper turns out to be a new commutator estimate leading to a novel monotonicity formula , which may be of independent interest for both linear and nonlinear schrdinger equations .    as a model for",
    "the quantum dynamics of an atom , let us first consider the time - dependent nonlinear hartree equation with an external coulomb potential : @xmath5 u(0,x)=u_0(x)\\in h^1({\\mathbb{r}}^3 ) .",
    "\\end{cases } \\label{eq : hartree - equation}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 describes the quantum state of the electrons ( which are treated as bosons for simplicity ) in an atom  @xcite .",
    "the terms in the parenthesis are respectively the kinetic energy operator of the electrons , the electrostatic attractive interaction with the nucleus of charge @xmath4 , and the mutual repulsion between the electrons themselves ( in units such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the total number of electrons in the system is a conserved quantity , which is given by @xmath9 in physical applications , the number @xmath10 is an integer but it is convenient to allow any positive real number here .",
    "note that , in section [ sec : extensions ] below , we will also consider the physically more accurate hartree ",
    "fock model as well as the full many - body schrdinger equation describing atoms .",
    "but for the time being , we deal with the hartree equation .",
    "the nonlinear equation   and many variations thereof have been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "the existence of a unique strong global - in - time solution to with an initial datum @xmath11 goes back to chadam and glassey  @xcite .",
    "their argument is based on a fixed point argument combined with the conservation of the hartree energy defined by @xmath12 in fact , the global well - posedness result for can be extended to initial data in @xmath13 ; see for instance  @xcite . however , in what follows , we will always assume that @xmath14 lies in the energy space @xmath15 so that its corresponding energy is well - defined .",
    "when @xmath16 , the solution @xmath17 to the hartree equation exhibits a purely dispersive behavior , which has been studied by many authors . here , some works were devoted to the understanding of the dispersive effects for any initial datum  @xcite , whereas several others dealt with the construction of ( modified ) scattering  @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in the physically more relevant case when @xmath18 holds , which corresponds to having an external attractive long - range potential due to the presence of a positively charged atomic nucleus .",
    "the electrons can ( and will ) now be bound by the nucleus , and the problem to understand the long - time behavior of solutions is much more delicate .",
    "for instance , it was already noticed by chadam and glassey in  ( * ? ? ? * thm .",
    "4.1 ) that the solution @xmath17 can not tend to zero in @xmath19 as @xmath20 for negative energies @xmath21 , which can occur if @xmath22 holds .",
    "when @xmath23 , there exists nonlinear bound states , which are solutions of equation   taking the simple form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 solves the nonlinear eigenvalue equation @xmath26 for any fixed @xmath27 , it is known that the equation   has infinitely many solutions such that @xmath28 . moreover , there is a unique positive solution , which minimizes the hartree energy  @xcite subject to @xmath10 fixed , and the other ( sign - changing ) solutions can be constructed by min - max methods  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the condition @xmath27 is that the atom is neutral ( if @xmath29 ) or positively ionized ( if @xmath30 ) . in this situation",
    ", it is not energetically favorable to send a positive fraction of @xmath31-mass @xmath32 , say , to spatial infinity , since the remaining charge is @xmath33 positive and thus attractive far away from the origin .",
    "a more precise mathematical statement is that the palais  smale sequences with a bounded morse index can not exhibit a lack of compactness when @xmath34 , and this implies the existence of infinitely many critical points  @xcite .",
    "it is known that there are bound states in the case of negative ionization , i.e.  when @xmath35 holds . by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 7.19 ) ( see also  @xcite ) , there is a minimizer of the hartree functional for @xmath10 slightly larger than @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is physically clear that there should not be any bound state when @xmath10 is too large compared to @xmath4 , because a given nucleus is not expected to bind too many electrons compared to its nuclear charge . in  @xcite",
    ", it was proved that there exists a universal critical constant @xmath36 such that the equation   has _ no solution _ for @xmath37 but has at least one for @xmath38 . that @xmath39 is independent of @xmath4 follows from a simple scaling argument .",
    "let us now collect some basic facts about the set of solutions of the time - independent problem .",
    "for any @xmath40 , the self - adjoint operator @xmath41 has no positive eigenvalue , by the kato ",
    "simon theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "xiii.58 ) .",
    "this shows that necessarily @xmath42 in equation  .",
    "furthermore , we can derive an upper bound on @xmath43 which only depends on @xmath4 as follows .",
    "if @xmath25 solves , then by taking then the scalar product with @xmath44 we find that @xmath45 here we have used the inequality @xmath46 which follows from the value of the hydrogen ground state energy , @xmath47 .",
    "we conclude that any solution @xmath25 to must satisfy the bound @xmath48 recalling that @xmath49 holds , we conclude that the set of all stationary states @xmath50 is bounded in @xmath15 .",
    "elementary arguments show that @xmath51 is weakly compact in @xmath15 .",
    "but we note that the set @xmath51 is not compact in the strong @xmath52-topology .",
    "supported by physical reasoning and rigorous results in linear scattering theory about asymptotic completeness ( see remark  [ rmk : linear ] below ) , it is common belief for infinite - dimensional hamiltonian systems such as that any of its solutions should behave for large times as a superposition of one or several states getting closer to the global attractor @xmath51 , plus a dispersive part .",
    "this is what has already been shown for @xmath16 , in which case @xmath53 .",
    "not much is known in this direction for nonlinear schrdinger equations  @xcite , and solving this problem ( a.k.a .",
    "soliton resolution ) constitutes a major mathematical challenge . for the hartree equation   studied in this paper ,",
    "the situation is even less clear because of possible modified scattering due to the long - range effects of the coulomb potential .",
    "we can , however , formulate a simpler ( but weaker ) conjecture as follows .",
    "[ conj : attractor ] let @xmath17 be the unique solution to the hartree equation   for some @xmath11 . take any sequence of times @xmath54 such that @xmath55 weakly in @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath56 .",
    "[ rmk : linear ] let us recall that the hartree equation   is a nonlinear approximation of the linear many - body schrdinger equation @xmath57 \\psi(0)=\\psi_0\\in h^1\\left(({\\mathbb{r}}^3)^n\\right ) \\end{cases } \\label{eq : many - body}\\ ] ] on the contrary to the hartree case where we can allow @xmath58 to take any positive real value , the number @xmath10 of electrons must of course be an integer for  .",
    "the hartree equation   is obtained by constraining the solution @xmath59 to stay on the manifold of product states of the form @xmath60 and using the dirac  frenkel principle .",
    "then @xmath61 solves  .",
    "let us remark that   can be rewritten after a simple rescaling as follows @xmath62 \\psi(0)=\\psi_0\\in h^1\\left(({\\mathbb{r}}^3)^n\\right ) \\end{cases } \\label{eq : many - body - scaled}\\ ] ] thus the limit of large @xmath63 with @xmath64 fixed corresponds to the usual mean - field limit .",
    "in this regime , hartree s theory is known to properly describe ( bosonic ) atoms , both for ground states  @xcite and in the time - dependent case  @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a review on mean - field limits and the hartree approximation .",
    "the many - body equation   looks complicated , but it has the advantage of being linear . in particular , the rage theorem tells us that the only possible non - zero weak limits of @xmath59 when @xmath20 are bounds states of the hamiltonian @xmath65 in the parenthesis  @xcite .",
    "this is not a very precise description of the solution for large times because if some particles stay close to the nucleus while other escape to infinity , we will always get @xmath66 weakly in @xmath67 , see  @xcite .",
    "however , asymptotic completeness is known to hold for the linear evolution equation .",
    "this exactly says that any solution @xmath59 is , in an appropriate sense , a superposition of bound states of the operators @xmath68 with @xmath69 and of scattering states  @xcite .",
    "because of the behavior of the underlying many - body system , it is reasonable to believe that the same should be true for the hartree equation  .",
    "a somewhat weaker property that would follow from conjecture  [ conj : attractor ] ( at least for  ) is that for large times , the local mass of any solution has to be smaller than @xmath70 .    [",
    "conj : mass ] let @xmath17 be the unique solution to the hartree equation   for some @xmath11",
    ". then @xmath71 and @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath74 is certainly not optimal here . in physical terms , the conjecture says that whatever the number of electrons we start with ( and whatever their kinetic energy ) , we will always end up with at most @xmath70 electrons having a universally bounded total kinetic energy .",
    "the other electrons have to scatter because the attraction of the nucleus with positive charge @xmath4 is not strong enough to keep all the electrons in its neighborhood .",
    "it could be that proving the weaker conjecture  [ conj : mass ] is not much easier than proving the stronger conjecture  [ conj : attractor ] .",
    "we actually have very little information on @xmath39 .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in conjecture  [ conj : mass ] .",
    "we will prove a time - averaged version of  , with @xmath39 replaced by @xmath75 in the radial case , and by @xmath76 in the general case .",
    "our main result is as follows .",
    "[ thm : hartree ] suppose @xmath18 , let @xmath14 be an arbitrary initial datum in @xmath15 , and denote by @xmath17 the unique solution of  .",
    "then , for any @xmath77 , we have the following estimate @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 in particular , we have @xmath81 for every @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , we have the following estimate on the local kinetic energy @xmath82 and therefore @xmath83 for every @xmath73 .",
    "if the initial datum @xmath84 is radial , then @xmath17 is radial for all times and the same estimate   holds true with @xmath1 replaced by @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the estimate holds true with @xmath85 replaced by @xmath86 .",
    "note that we do not exactly get that the limiting mass is @xmath87 for large times , but we only know it in the sense of _ time averages _ of the form @xmath88 .",
    "such a statement is reminiscent of the celebrated rage theorem  @xcite for linear time evolutions generated by self - adjoint operators .",
    "the constants in the error terms of   and   are probably not optimal at all , but they are displayed here to emphasize that our method can provide simple and explicit bounds . however , we have not tried to optimize these constants too much .    in the radial case , we are able to get the same numerical value of @xmath75 as the best known estimate on @xmath39 .",
    "however , we use a virial - type argument that seems to be quite different from lieb s celebrated proof in  @xcite in the stationary case ( which , for radial solutions , goes back to benguria  @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", our approach provides an alternative proof of the fact that @xmath89 in the stationary radial case .",
    "now , we explain the main ideas used in the proof of theorem  [ thm : hartree ] . to this end , we start by quickly recalling lieb s proof  @xcite that @xmath89 holds .",
    "his idea is to take the scalar product of the stationary hartree equation   with @xmath90 , leading to the estimate @xmath91 using that @xmath42 holds . to conclude",
    ", it suffices to notice that we have @xmath92 by hardy s inequality , and that @xmath93 by the triangle inequality . combining these estimates",
    ", we obtain that @xmath94 , which implies the bound @xmath95 for the stationary problem .",
    "( note that the inequality is strict , since there is no optimizer in hardy s inequality . )    in view of lieb s argument for the stationary problem , it appears to be a viable strategy in the time - dependent setting to consider the quantity @xmath96 ( or some spatially localized version thereof ) .",
    "indeed , if we take the second time derivative of @xmath97 , we are ( formally ) led to the well - known _ morawetz  lin  strauss estimate _ for nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nls ) , which has been proved of enormous value in the setting of nls with purely repulsive interactions . however , due to presence of the attractive term @xmath0 with @xmath22 in the hartree equation , the use of the classical morawetz  lin ",
    "strauss bounds does not yield any dispersive information about @xmath6 , even in the case when @xmath10 is large compared to @xmath4 .    in our situation",
    ", it turns out that it is more natural to study the time evolution of the third moment @xmath98 .",
    "if we compute its second time derivative , we obtain @xmath99u(t ) \\right\\rangle}}}+{{\\ensuremath{\\left\\langle u(t),i[v_u , a]u(t ) \\right\\rangle } } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this is the same as multiplying the time - dependent equation   by @xmath102 and taking the imaginary part .",
    "our key observation is the positivity of the commutator @xmath103=-\\frac13\\big[\\delta,\\big[\\delta,|x|^3\\big]\\big]{\\geqslant}0 \\label{eq : idea_positive_comm}\\ ] ] ( see also below ) , combined with the fact that @xmath104u(t ) \\right\\rangle } } }   & = -2\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^3}|x|x\\cdot\\nabla v_u(x ) |u(t , x)|^2\\\\ & = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^3}\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^3}(|x|x-|y|y)\\cdot\\frac{x - y}{|x - y|^3}|u(t , x)|^2|u(t , y)|^2dx\\,dy-2zn\\\\ & { \\geqslant}\\kappa\\ , n^2 - 2 zn,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 if @xmath17 is radial and @xmath106 otherwise ( see lemma  [ lem : estim_potential_x_3 ] below ) .",
    "hence , when @xmath107 , we deduce the lower bound @xmath108 therefore the quantity @xmath109 grows at least like @xmath110 for large @xmath111 and in particular @xmath112 is a monotone increasing quantity .",
    "this growth is a strong indication that some dispersion takes place and some particles have to escape to infinity .",
    "( a regularized version of the previous estimate will indeed show this claim for any @xmath52-solution . )",
    "note also that , in the time - independent case when @xmath44 is a nonlinear bound state ( and hence the left side in must be zero ) , this is also a new proof of lieb s inequality @xmath89 in the radial setting , since @xmath113 holds under this symmetry assumption .",
    "let us generally remark that virial or positive commutator arguments are very common in the literature  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath114 this leads to the famous morawetz inequalities  @xcite as already mentioned , whereas the case of @xmath115 gives the virial identity used by glassey in  @xcite to prove finite - time blowup for nls . in a recent work  @xcite ,",
    "tao advocated the use of @xmath116 for some nonlinear schrdinger equations in dimension @xmath117 , in order to get a universal bound on the mass of the solution .",
    "we are not aware of any use of the multiplier @xmath3 in the literature .",
    "in fact , using the cubic weight @xmath3 is rather natural from a dimensional point of view in our situation : if the potential term @xmath118 $ ] should be @xmath119 , then the virial function must behave like the third power of a length to compensate the laplacian and the coulomb potential .",
    "for the proof of our main result , we will in fact derive a whole class of double commutator estimates of the same kind as  , which we think is of independent interest too .",
    "in particular , we will show in   below that , in any dimension @xmath120 , we have the commutator bound @xmath121\\big]{\\geqslant}\\beta(\\beta+d-4)(d-\\beta)|x|^{\\beta-4 } , \\label{eq : general_dble_comm}\\ ] ] provided that @xmath122 .",
    "note that the right side is @xmath123 when @xmath124 . in spite of the fact that   turns out to be equivalent to a general version of hardy s inequality , we have not found it explicitly written ( let alone systematically treated ) in the literature .",
    "notice that the bound   contains the usual inequalities for @xmath125 , as well as tao s estimate for @xmath126 . in the present application",
    ", we shall use in dimension @xmath127 with @xmath128 , or rather a regularized version thereof . however , let us remark that the positivity of this commutator does not directly follow as in the `` classical '' cases when @xmath129 . to wit",
    "this , we note that , for @xmath130 , a calculation ( which will be detailed below ) yields the identity @xmath131 \\big ]   & = -\\delta \\delta |x|^3 - \\nabla \\cdot ( \\mathrm{hess}_{|x|^3 } ) \\nabla   \\\\ & = -\\frac{24}{|x| } - 12 \\nabla \\cdot   \\left [ |x| \\left ( 1 + \\omega_x \\omega_x^t \\right ) \\right ] \\nabla ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 denotes the unit vector in direction @xmath133 .",
    "obviously , the first term on the right side is negative definite . nevertheless ,",
    "when combined with the second term , the generalized hardy s inequality ( see below ) shows that we indeed have that the whole right - hand side is non negative , and hence the estimate follows in the particular case @xmath130 .",
    "ultimately , we are interested in general @xmath52-solutions @xmath17 without imposing any spatial weight condition .",
    "therefore , the strategy of proving theorem [ thm : hartree ] explained above needs to be further refined .",
    "in particular , the desired bound   on a ball of radius @xmath134 can not be obtained by only looking at the second derivative of the third moment as we have just explained . our method to extend   to any @xmath52-valued solution @xmath17 is to replace the function @xmath3 by a radial function @xmath135 which behaves like @xmath3 on the ball of radius @xmath134 and like @xmath114 at infinity .",
    "this will imply that @xmath136 $ ] defines a bounded operator on @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , we will need to derive a sufficiently good lower bound on the double commutator @xmath137 $ ] in order to imitate the previous argument on the ball only . in section [ sec : commutators ] , we explain how to do this for a general function @xmath138 .",
    "finally , the bound   on the local kinetic energy is itself obtained by considering another virial function @xmath139 which behaves like @xmath115 on the ball of radius @xmath134 and like @xmath114 at infinity .",
    "the complete proof of theorem  [ thm : hartree ] is given in section  [ sec : proof ] .      in physical reality , electrons are fermions , which means that the many - body wave function @xmath140 in   must be _ antisymmetric _ with respect to exchanges of its spatial variables @xmath141 .",
    "the hartree state @xmath142 is symmetric and it is therefore not allowed for physical electrons .",
    "this is why one speaks about _ bosonic _ atoms .",
    "the simplest product - like antisymmetric wave function is a _ hartree - fock state _ sometimes also called a slater determinant @xmath143 in section  [ sec : hartree - fock ] below , we extend theorem  [ thm : hartree ] to the corresponding time - dependent hartree - fock equations ; see theorem [ thm : hartree - fock ] for a precise statement .",
    "finally , we also consider the full many - body schrdinger equation   in section  [ sec : many - body ] below , where our findings are summarized in theorem [ thm : many - body ] .",
    "throughout this section , we use the convenient notation @xmath145 and in particular we have @xmath146 in what follows . in this section , we investigate how to get lower bounds for a double commutator of the form @xmath147 $ ] in general space dimensions @xmath148 .",
    "such a double commutator always arises when computing the second derivative of the expectation value of @xmath149 , in a non - relativistic system based on the laplacian .",
