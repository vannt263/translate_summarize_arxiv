    "the search for improved materials for magnetic recording and permanent magnets has been the driving force for research work in the area of magnetic condensed matter physics.@xcite artificially exchange - biased systems , like ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic ( fm - afm ) multilayers , have been widely studied , and they have been shown to provide large saturation magnetizations ( @xmath4 ) as well as high coercive fields ( @xmath5).@xcite however , the usually small exchange bias field ( @xmath6 ) is ultimately limited by the ability of the system to create an uncompensated magnetization at the antiferromagnet interface ( @xmath7).@xcite this interfacial magnetic moment induces a unidirectional anisotropy on the ferromagnet , and depends on a number of parameters including disorder , afm domain- and domain - wall - size , surface roughness , etc.@xcite a different kind of system , known as exchange - spring magnet was proposed by skomski and coey@xcite to provide a rather large exchange anisotropy energy . in two - phase nanocomposites ,",
    "small soft - fm inclusions adopt the anisotropy energy of a hard - fm matrix .",
    "such a case was observed in nd@xmath8fe@xmath9b/@xmath10-fe alloys.@xcite similarly , exchange anisotropy interactions have been studied in another large group of inhomogeneous materials presenting fm - afm interfaces , like fe / fe - oxide,@xcite co / coo,@xcite and ni / nio@xcite nanocomposites , spin glasses , etc.@xcite    in the heavily studied manganites , inhomogeneous magnetic phases are known to be at the root of the colossal magnetoresistance effect.@xcite considering the presence of fm - afm interfaces , exchange anisotropy interactions can also be expected in these materials .",

    ", we find that the surface exchange interaction is of afm nature , and its magnitude is similar to the bulk exchange interaction within the afm volume .",
    "finally , we also observe a training effect of the exchange bias , which is successfully analyzed using an existing relaxation model .",

    "the final sintering process was made at @xmath13 @xmath14c for 24 h , after which the sample was slowly cooled to room temperature .",

    "figure 1 presents data of @xmath21 as a function of temperature for the pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath22 manganite .",
    "the physical properties of this compound are mainly determined by the electrons on the mn ions .",
    "there is a mn core , where three electrons are strongly coupled to a total spin @xmath23 .",
    "the pr@xmath24/ca@xmath25 ratio introduces one doping electron for every three mn sites , responsible for the electrical transport .",
    "the peak of @xmath21 at @xmath26 k indicates the charge ordering transition of the material,@xcite where the double exchange interaction is suppressed due to the localization of the charge carriers , producing a large drop of the susceptibility . at a lower temperature ,",

    "1 was measured after cooling the sample from @xmath30 k to @xmath18 k with an applied cooling field @xmath31 koe .",
    "a more careful examination of these data reveals two notable features , namely a hysteresis ( coercivity ) and a shift of the @xmath28 curve from the origin , i.e. exchange bias .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the shift of the loops has the same magnitude but opposite sign when the cooling field is negative , confirming the existence of the exchange bias phenomenon . for @xmath32",

    "this fm component becomes evident in fig .",
    "2 , where we present the resulting magnetization ( @xmath33 ) after the afm moment is subtracted .",
    "this intrinsic coexistence of different magnetic phases is commonly found in many manganese perovskite compounds in the whole range of carrier doping , and is usually referred to as electronic phase separation.@xcite    ) vs @xmath16 loop , after subtracting the contribution of the afm matrix ( @xmath29 k , @xmath31 koe ) .",
    "inset : blow - up of the low - field region , showing the determination of the remanent moments @xmath34 and @xmath35.,height=234 ]    as the magnetic field is reduced from the maximum value @xmath17 koe , the ferromagnetic moment becomes negative at @xmath36 koe , while on the increasing branch of the loop @xmath33 changes sign at @xmath37 koe .",
    "these two fields define a coercive field @xmath38 koe and an exchange bias field @xmath39 koe . however , the values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 depend on the value of the susceptibility used to subtract the afm background , thus preventing a precise determination of @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively , the exchange bias behavior can be seen as a vertical shift of the @xmath42 loop , as evidenced by the positive remanent magnetization obtained even after recoil from a very negative reverse field ( @xmath43 koe ) .",
    "this effect is a manifestation of the presence of a unidirectional exchange anisotropy interaction , which drives the fm domains back to the original orientation when the magnetic field is removed .",
    "therefore , since for @xmath44 there is no contribution from the afm volume , we choose to quantify the exchange bias effect using the remanent magnetization .",
    "for this reason , we define the magnetization shift @xmath45 and the magnetic coercivity @xmath46 as the  vertical axis \" equivalents of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively . naming as @xmath34 and @xmath35 the remanent magnetizations on the field decreasing and increasing branches of the loop , respectively ( as in the inset of fig .",
    "2 ) , we define @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( for the data shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath49 gauss and @xmath50 gauss ) . with these definitions ,",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath45 are quantitative indications of coercivity and exchange bias , respectively . indeed , in the simplest model of single - domain fm particles ( that we assume in this work )",
    ", a relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath6 can be easily derived .",
    "considering the magnetic moments switching by thermal activation over the anisotropy barrier @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the anisotropy constant and @xmath53 the volume of the particles ) , the exchange bias field introduces an asymmetry in the activation energy for the backward and forward switching such that    @xmath54    where @xmath4 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath55 sec@xmath56 is the switching attempt frequency , @xmath57 sec is the typical measurement time , @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath59 is the magnetic moment of the fm particles . for a small enough magnetic energy ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "( [ mevshe ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath61    indicating a direct equivalence between @xmath45 and @xmath6 .",
    "our analysis in the next subsection shows that @xmath62 is always lower than 0.9 , justifying _ a posteriori _ the use of this relationship .",
    "the fact that reverse fields as high as @xmath43 koe are not able to produce a negative @xmath35 , indicates that the exchange interactions giving rise to the described effects must be of considerable strength .",
    "the origin of such exchange anisotropy is revealed by the temperature dependence of the magnetization shift , as presented in fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    ", the sample was cooled down from @xmath30 k to @xmath18 k with an applied field @xmath63 koe , and warmed back to the measuring temperature without removing the applied field . at the appropriate temperature , the magnetization loop was measured between @xmath64 and @xmath65 koe , from which @xmath45 and @xmath46 were calculated .",
    "it can be seen that , as the temperature increases , the magnetization shift vanishes right at the nel temperature of the afm background , @xmath66 k , while the coercivity remains present up to the temperature marked as @xmath67 , which is @xmath68 k higher than @xmath69 and indicates the onset of the fm component .     and",
    "@xmath46 , showing the onset of exchange bias and coercivity at @xmath69 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "inset : @xmath45 and the ratio @xmath70 at low temperatures . both quantities",
    "sharply increase below the freezing temperature , @xmath71 k.,height=234 ]    the temperature evolution shown in fig .",
    "3 is typical of exchange bias systems.@xcite as the sample is cooled through @xmath69 with an applied magnetic field , the exchange interaction between the afm phase and the polarized fm phase induces an interface magnetic moment on the antiferromagnet ( @xmath7 ) , which remains frozen at lower temperatures.@xcite in turn , below the freezing temperature @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath7 provides the necessary pinning forces ( exchange anisotropy ) to drive the ferromagnet back to a positive remanence on recoil .",
    "then , the exchange bias behavior , observed through the appearance of a distinctive magnetization shift , is induced by the interface exchange coupling between the fm domains and the charge - ordered afm background .",
    "although the magnetization shift first develops at @xmath74 k , it is useful to note that the main freezing temperature of the system is @xmath71 k. the inset of fig .",
    "3 shows the temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath70 , the magnetization of the material measured in fc and zfc processes , respectively .",
    "the increase of this ratio below @xmath72 is due to the enhancement of the magnetic irreversibility induced by the freezing of the surface spins .",
    "simultaneous with the upward turn of @xmath70 , @xmath45 also exhibits a steep increase of more than one order of magnitude below @xmath75 k. this indicates that a small number of interfaces start to freeze at @xmath69 , but the dominant contribution to the low temperature @xmath45 comes from domains with @xmath71 k. the existence of low-@xmath72 spins has been also observed in other systems,@xcite and have been attributed to glass - like phases occurring in spin - disordered surfaces around the ordered particles.@xcite indeed , the irreversibility shown by the ratio @xmath70 is a fingerprint of the glassy behavior in nanoparticles systems . in this context",
    ", a partial alignment of the glassy spins leads to the interface moment @xmath7 , and the temperature @xmath72 is a measure of the energy barriers separating multiple spin configurations of the glass - like phase .    in order to get some insight into the properties of this exchange biased system , we studied the cooling field dependence of @xmath45 . for each data point shown in fig .",
    "4 , the sample was cooled from @xmath30 k to @xmath18 k with the applied cooling field , and a hysteresis loop was measured between @xmath17 and @xmath43 koe . as shown in this figure",
    ", @xmath45 presents a smooth increasing dependence with @xmath76 , which saturates at high cooling fields .",
    "the exchange bias field is usually thought as the balance between the zeeman energy of the fm particles and the surface energy due to the interface exchange interaction,@xcite i.e. ,    @xmath77    @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the number of spins inside the fm volume and on the disordered afm shell , respectively , thus @xmath6 depends , as expected , on the surface - to - volume ratio .",
    "the surface exchange constant is represented by @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the gyromagnetic factor , and @xmath82 is the bohr magneton . from eq .",
    "( [ hevsmi ] ) , the usual meiklejohn - bean expression@xcite for fm - afm bilayers is easily recovered by making the appropriate replacements , e.g. @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the out - of - plane lattice parameter and @xmath85 the thickness of the fm layer .    .",
    "the solid line is a fit with an exchange interaction model between the fm domains and a disordered afm shell ( see text).,height=241 ]    for small cooling fields , the coupling of the interface moment to the fm volume dominates over the coupling of @xmath7 to @xmath76 , implying that the surface spin configuration minimizes the surface energy and @xmath86 , producing a negative @xmath6 .",
    "however , it has been shown that for afm couplings ( @xmath87 ) , a large enough cooling field could prevail and flip the interface moment , producing a positive @xmath7 at the freezing temperature and changing the sign of the exchange bias field.@xcite assuming 1-to-1 core - shell spin interactions , these competing energies can be described in an effective magnetic field acting on the interface moment during the freezing process as    @xmath88    with @xmath89 the magnetic moment per fm spin at the freezing temperature .",
    "for our small magnetic domains , we assume @xmath90 , where @xmath91 @xmath82 is the magnetic moment of the mn core spin , @xmath92 is the langevin function , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . at lower temperatures , because of the glassy behavior of the surface spins the interface moment @xmath7 ( @xmath95 ) remains frozen , inducing the exchange bias response .",
    "therefore , combining eqs .",
    "( [ mevshelinear ] ) , ( [ hevsmi ] ) , and ( [ hef ] ) we obtain    @xmath96 \\label{hcooldependence}\\ ] ]    in this equation , the competition between the exchange interaction and the cooling field becomes evident . for small",
    "@xmath76 the first term usually dominates , and @xmath6 ( @xmath97 ) depends on @xmath98 .",
    "however , for large cooling fields the second term ( @xmath99 ) becomes important , and for @xmath87 the absolute value of @xmath6 could decrease@xcite or even more , it could change sign , as observed in previous works.@xcite in fig .",
    "4 , the solid line corresponds to a fit to eq .",
    "( [ hcooldependence ] ) with @xmath80 and @xmath78 adjustable parameters , which indicates a quite good agreement of the experimental data with the simple model described above . moreover , the agreement is not only qualitative but also quantitative .",
    "the exchange constant obtained from the fit was @xmath100 mev .",
    "this coupling constant indicates an afm coupling between the fm domains and the afm host , explaining the tendency of @xmath101 towards a reduction at high @xmath76 .",
    "on top of this , a mean field estimation of the exchange interaction for an antiferromagnet with @xmath102 k gives @xmath103 mev , in excellent agreement with the value obtained .",
    "this indicates that the exchange interaction within the afm volume extends across the boundary with the fm domains without noticeable changes .",
    "further , the number of spins per fm droplet is @xmath104 ( @xmath105 @xmath82 ) , corresponding to a droplet diameter @xmath106  .",
    "this kind of fm nanodomain was already observed in the la@xmath107ca@xmath108mno@xmath22 manganite@xcite and in la@xmath109sr@xmath110mno@xmath22,@xcite where small angle neutron scattering experiments show the presence of fm droplets with the same characteristic size , and a density of domains @xmath111 @xmath112 . in our pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath22 sample ,",
    "an estimation of the density of fm droplets can be made from the saturation magnetization , which can be written as    @xmath113    with @xmath114 gauss obtained from fig .",
    "2 , we estimate @xmath115 @xmath112 , which is very similar to the mentioned neutron scattering results .",
    "this density of droplets implies that the fm phase occupies only around @xmath116 of the volume of the material , explaining the almost imperceptible fm signal that superposes on the afm magnetization .    at this point",
    "it is worth noting that , although in previous works the small interface moment @xmath7 has been detected by different techniques,@xcite in our case this moment is negligible as compared to @xmath45 . an estimation from eq .",
    "( [ hevsmi ] ) indicates that the maximum contribution of the interface is @xmath117 @xmath82 per surface spin .",
    "this represents only a @xmath118 of the maximum possible value ( @xmath119 @xmath82 ) , in coincidence with measurements in other different systems.@xcite this @xmath7 is indeed much smaller than the shift of the loops , which is @xmath120 @xmath82 per fm spin ( @xmath121 ) at the same cooling field .",
    "moreover , while @xmath7 is negative the measured @xmath45 is always positive .",
    "therefore , the magnetization shift measured in our system corresponds almost in its entirety to the remanence of the fm domains , as assumed in our analysis .",
    "the exchange bias phenomenon observed in our material would be similar to that taking place in artificially fabricated nanocomposites,@xcite where fm nanoparticles are surrounded by the afm oxide .",
    "this kind of core - shell interaction has been shown to provide quite strong magnetic anisotropies . in our case , using @xmath121 and @xmath122 koe ( for @xmath31 koe ) , from eq .",
    "( [ mevshe ] ) we can estimate an anisotropy constant @xmath123 erg/@xmath124 .",
    "this is a quite important magnetic anisotropy , two orders of magnitude larger than the usual magnetocrystalline anisotropy measured in bulk fm manganites.@xcite it is clear that this notable anisotropy constant is related to the particular magnetic configuration of the pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath22 compound . in spring - magnet materials , it has been shown that the exchange anisotropy increases when the soft - fm domain size decreases , acquiring the anisotropy energy of the hard - fm matrix.@xcite similarly , the exchange bias phenomenon is related to the surface exchange interaction between the fm and afm phases .",
    "therefore , it is widely accepted that , in nanocomposite materials , @xmath52 is proportional to the surface - to - volume ratio of the fm domains . in the case of our nanometric fm domains , where @xmath125 , the ratio @xmath126 is close to 1 , being compatible with the high anisotropy constant estimated .",
    "elastic effects in the charge - ordered phase tend to produce not spherical but elongated secondary phases,@xcite therefore a shape anisotropy energy could be also contributing to the anisotropy constant . from the structural point of view , the strength of the exchange anisotropy is influenced by the existence of surface strain and atomic displacement .",
    "this disorder modifies the interface exchange constant,@xcite and could be particularly relevant in nanocomposites where the constituents are structurally and chemically different .",
    "however , our manganite is an _ intrinsic nanocomposite _",
    ", where the fm droplets appear naturally embedded in the afm background and where structural and chemical differences should be less important . as a consequence ,",
    "the obtained interface exchange constant is as large as in the bulk of the material , favoring a high exchange anisotropy as well .",
    "koe.,height=249 ]    in exchange bias systems , a gradual decrease of the anisotropy interaction is commonly found as the material is continuously field - cycled ; the so - called training effect.@xcite as a result , the exchange bias and the coercive fields decrease with increasing loop index number . in our manganite , the training effect is also present , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . this figure presents the consecutive @xmath33-@xmath16 loops measured for fields between @xmath17 and @xmath43 koe , after the sample was field - cooled with @xmath31 koe ( only loops with index number @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 are shown ) .",
    "the relaxation of the magnetization shift is evident and , as shown by the evolution of @xmath45 with @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , this relaxation is particularly important between the first and second loops , where @xmath45 falls by @xmath132 .    )",
    "vs loop index number ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the solid triangles correspond to a fit with a recursive law , that results from a discretized relaxation model .",
    "inset : @xmath45 vs @xmath133 , showing the linear behavior usually obtained .",
    "the line is a least squares fit.,height=245 ]    the training effect has been explained in terms of the demagnetization of the afm surface moment @xmath7.@xcite as the fm domain switches back and forth under the influence of the applied field , a relaxation of the surface spin configuration towards the equilibrium is induced due to the _ surface drag _ of the exchange interaction .",
    "this is particularly relevant for glass - like phases , where multiple spin configurations are available .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that magnetic frustration and the existence of multiple easy axes orientations on the afm counterpart of the fm / afm interface are essential for the occurrence of training effects.@xcite    the usual experimentally observed relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath131 is given by    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the equilibrium magnetization shift .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "6 , this equation holds for @xmath136 , with @xmath137 gauss .",
    "however , as already stated in previous works@xcite this equation holds only for loop indices @xmath136 , and can not explain the steep relaxation between the first and second loops . in recent work binek,@xcite using a discretized relaxation model",
    "deduced a recursive formula that relates the @xmath138-th loop shift with the @xmath131-th one as    @xmath139    with @xmath140 a sample dependent constant determined by microscopic parameters like the spin damping constant . with this simple relationship , and using @xmath141 gauss@xmath142 and @xmath143 gauss , the whole set of data",
    "is reproduced ( solid triangles in fig .",
    "6 ) , including the large initial drop of @xmath45 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , the recursive law is recovered for @xmath144 , therefore explaining its applicability in this regime .",
    "in summary , we provide the first evidence of intrinsic interface exchange coupling in phase separated manganites .",
    "our magnetization measurements show the coexistence of a predominant charge - ordered afm phase and a minor fm component in the pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 compound . furthermore ,",
    "after cooling the sample through the nel temperature with an applied magnetic field this manganite presents exchange bias .",
    "this is clearly revealed by a distinctive magnetization shift ( @xmath45 ) in the remanence of the @xmath15-@xmath16 loops .",
    "the cooling field dependence of @xmath45 at low temperature was successfully analyzed in terms of a simple exchange interaction model between fm nanodroplets of @xmath3 @xmath145 in size and a disordered ( glassy - like ) afm shell .",
    "the observed training effect of the exchange bias can be described with the same relaxation model used for other classical exchange bias systems , indicating a similar mechanism for exchange anisotropy . moreover ,",
    "the anisotropy constant deduced , @xmath123 erg/@xmath124 , is two orders of magnitude larger than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of other common fm manganites .",
    "this large anisotropy energy opens a new possibility for the development of hard fm materials , where important exchange anisotropy interactions are introduced by intrinsic inhomogeneities that naturally occur in phase separated magnetic materials .",
