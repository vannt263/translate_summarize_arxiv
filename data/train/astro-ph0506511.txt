    "the bright 5.54  s x - ray pulsar  is the second example of a transient anomalous x - ray pulsar ( taxp ) and the first one confirmed by measuring a rapid spin - down rate .",
    "all of its observed and derived physical parameters are consistent with classification as an anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) , one that had an impulsive outburst sometime between 2002 november and 2003 january , when it was discovered serendipitously by @xcite using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "its flux was observed to be declining with an exponential time constant of @xmath6  days from a maximum of @xmath7 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 .",
    "the source was then localized precisely using two target of opportunity ( too ) observations with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) and @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "archival detections by several x - ray satellites indicate a long - lived quiescent baseline flux of @xmath10 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 lasting at least 13  years and possibly for 23  years prior to the outburst ( paper  i ) .",
    "fading of an ir source within the _ chandra _  error circle , similar to ones associated with other axps , confirmed its identification with @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectra and pulse profiles from three observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _  during the decline of the outburst were studied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "the short duty cycle of activity of  suggests the existence of a significant population of as - yet unrecognized , although not necessarily undetected , young neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "in this paper we present a new _ xmm - newton _  observation of .",
    "this data set , combined with previous _ xmm - newton _  observations acquired over the last year , allows us to characterize the spectral evolution of a transient axp .",
    "we show that the decay rates of the two fitted x - ray spectral components are distinct , and can be extrapolated in time to approach the previous quiescent spectrum .",
    "for consistency with papers i and ii , we express results in terms of a maximum distance of @xmath11  kpc to the pulsar . however , there is reason to believe that  is significantly closer than this , and we take into account a more realistic estimate of 2.5  kpc in our discussion of proposed physical models for the x - ray emission and outburst mechanism .",
    "a fourth _ xmm - newton _  observation of  was obtained on 2004 september 18 .",
    "the previous three observations are described in paper  ii .",
    "we use the data collected with the european photon imaging camera ( epic , @xcite ) which consist of three ccd imagers , the epic  pn and the two epic  moss , each sensitive to x - rays in the @xmath12  kev energy range . in the following we concentrate on data taken with the epic  pn detector , which provided a timing resolution of 48  ms in `` large window '' mode , for ease of comparison with the earlier data sets .",
    "the fast readout of this instrument ensures that its spectrum is not affected by photon pileup .",
    "data collected with the two epic  mos sensors used the `` small window '' mode and `` timing '' mode , providing a time resolution of 0.3  s and 1.5  ms , respectively .    for the new data set , we followed the reduction and analysis procedures used for the previous _ xmm - newton _  observations of , as outlined in paper ii . the new observation is mostly uncontaminated by flare events and the filtered data set resulted in a total of 26.5  ks of good epic pn exposure time ( 24.4  ks live time ) .",
    "we checked for timing anomalies that were evident in some previous epic  pn data sets and found none .",

    "these are derived from photons obtained with both the epic  pn and mos cameras , with the exception of the short 2003 october 12 observation for which only epic  pn data of sufficient time resolution is available .",
    "the errors are the 95% confidence level determined from the @xmath15 test . as shown in figure [ timing ] , the four period measurements can be fitted to yield a mean spin - down rate of @xmath16 s  s@xmath9 over the year - long interval .",
    "this implies a characteristic age @xmath17  yr , surface magnetic field @xmath18  g , and spin - down power @xmath19 erg  s@xmath9 , comparable to the earlier values ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper  ii ) . deviations from a constant @xmath20 are evident , however , since @xcite fitted values in the range @xmath21  s  s@xmath9 in the first 9 months of the outburst .",
    "as discussed in paper ii (  2.2 ) , timing glitches in axps can result in large increases in their period derivatives [ @xmath22 ; e.g. , 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite and 1rxs j170849.0400910 @xcite ] .",
    "accordingly , it is possible that  experienced a glitch and an increase in @xmath20 at the time of its outburst , and that @xmath20 is now relaxing to its long - term value .",
    "but since there is no prior ephemeris for  in its quiescent state , we do not know if its outburst was triggered by a glitch .",
    "alternatively , the spin - down torque could have been enhanced in the early stages of the outburst by an increase over the dipole value of the magnetic field strength at the speed - of - light cylinder @xcite , or by a particle wind and alfvn waves @xcite , effects that are expected to decline after the first few months .",

    "each of these two temperatures , which we refer to as `` warm '' and `` hot '' , respectively , remained essentially the same , nominally to within @xmath78 of that reported for the first _ xmm - newton _  observation ( see table  [ summary ] ) .",
    "however , the warm and hot blackbody luminosities declined by 33% and 70% , respectively , in one year . with the temperature of the hot component remaining essentially constant , its decline in luminosity is attributable to a decrease in its emitting area , @xmath79",
    "the most recent value , @xmath80  @xmath38 , is @xmath81 of the ns surface area . in the case of the warm component ,",
    "the decay in flux is modest , so that it is not yet possible to decide within the errors whether the temperature or the area is the primary variable .",
    "the most recent area measurement of the warm component , @xmath82  @xmath38 , is @xmath83 of the ns surface area .",

    "this is equivalent to determining the relative projected area of emission as a function of rotation phase .",
    "the fits are again found to be each statistically acceptable as a set , so no significant test can be made for variations in additional parameters such as the temperatures or column density .",
    "the results of the phase - resolved spectral fits are shown in figure  [ phase ] .",
    "comparison between the data sets taken a year apart shows that the modulation with phase of each blackbody component has remained steady to within the measurement errors .",
    "the phase alignment of the two temperature components has remained the same , and the pulses peak at the same phase .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of a small , hot region surrounded by a warm , concentric annulus that occupies @xmath84 the surface area of the star .",
    "neither component disappears at any rotation phase .",
    "in particular , if the hot component were completely eclipsed , the spectral decomposition in figure  [ specfig ] indicates that the light curves at @xmath85  kev should dip to zero ; clearly they do not .",
    "with the set of _ xmm - newton _  measurements spanning a year , a more accurate characterization of the x - ray flux decay of  is possible than that reported in the initial _ rxte _  study of @xcite .",
    "the bolometric flux over time , shown in figure  [ history ] , reveals a new and complex behavior . while the _ rxte _  data were consistent with an exponential decay of time constant @xmath86 days , the subsequent _ xmm - newton _  measurements show that the inferred bolometric luminosity of the two spectral components are not declining at the same rate . from the data presented in table  [ summary ] we find that the luminosity of the hotter temperature component falls exponentially with @xmath87  days , while the warm component decreases with @xmath2  days , which , although less reliably characterized , is clearly longer than @xmath88 .",
    "the shorter time constant is very close to the one describing the _ rxte _  data .",
    "furthermore , the _ rxte _  spectrum itself is fitted best by a single temperature blackbody of @xmath89  kev @xcite , without a power - law contribution , which is consistent with our interpretation of the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum . since _",
    "rxte_is sensitive only at energies @xmath90  kev where the hotter blackbody component dominates , the overall x - ray decay from the beginning of the outburst to the present appears consistent with separate exponential time constants corresponding to the two distinct thermal - spectrum components .",
    "we also note that it is not possible to fit an alternative power - law temporal decay to the hot blackbody flux ; such a model would require a decay index that steepens with time .    as shown in figure  [ history ] , we expect that the x - ray flux of  will return to its historic quiescent level by the year 2007 .",
    "if the quiescent spectrum is to match that observed before the current outburst , then it would likely resemble the _ rosat _  observation of 1992 march 7 .",
    "although of relatively poor quality , the _ rosat_spectrum can be reasonably well fitted with a single blackbody of @xmath91  kev covering @xmath92  @xmath38 and @xmath93  ergs  s@xmath9 ( paper i ) .",
    "this blackbody is significantly cooler and larger than the outburst warm component of @xmath94  kev and @xmath95  @xmath38 , so it should be present even now , although masked by the fading outburst emission .",
    "we estimate that the @xmath96  kev blackbody spectrum measured with _ rosat",
    "_  would contribute 30% of the latest ( 2004 september ) _ xmm - newton _",
    "measured flux at 0.5  kev .",
    "therefore , we expect that such a cooler component will begin to dominate the soft x - ray spectrum in late 2006 , consistent with the projection of the flux in figure  [ history ] .",
    "the energy - resolved folded light curves from the 2003 september 8 _ xmm - newton _  observation ( fig .",
    "[ pulse]a ) show that the pulse peak , in general , is somewhat narrower than a sinusoid , an effect that is more pronounced at higher energy .",
    "examination of the light curves measured one year later ( 2004 september 18 ; fig .",
    "[ pulse]d ) shows a clear energy - dependent change .",
    "this is easily seen by forming the ratio of the curves taken at the two epochs , normalized by their count - weighted mean .",
    "these ratio curves , presented in fig",
    ".  [ ratio ] , show changes in amplitude of up to 20% .",
    "specifically , the pulse shape of the lower - energy light curves has evolved to a smaller amplitude , more sinusoidal profile .",
    "this change is highly significant as determined by the reduced @xmath97 ( 24 degrees - of - freedom ) for the null hypothesis of a flat line ( see labels on fig .  [ ratio ] ) .",
    "in particular , the most pronounced variation is found in the 1.01.5  kev band with @xmath98 corresponding to an infinitesimal probability of the pulse shape being constant . in contrast , the pulse shape of the higher energy bins remained essentially unchanged , as evidence by their @xmath97 values near unity .",
    "this trend is reflected in the two intervening observations ( fig .",
    "[ pulse]c and [ pulse]d ) as well .",
    "0.1 in    the pulse profile must be made up of some combination of pulsed emission intrinsic to each of the two measured spectral components . in any given energy band ,",
    "the changing relative contribution of the soft and hard spectral components forces the combined pulse shapes to evolve in time .",
    "one way of quantifying this change is to define the pulsed fraction @xmath99 , the fraction of flux above the minimum in the light curve .",
    "this is found to increase smoothly with energy from 34% at less than 1  kev to @xmath100 above 5  kev at the earlier epoch ( see table  [ pulsefit ] and fig .",
    "[ pulse ] ) . at the latest epoch reported herein , the pulsed fraction in the lower energy band decreased to 26% while it remained essentially unchanged at the higher energy .",
    "the simplest hypothesis for modeling the light curve evolution is to assume that the intrinsic light curve of each spectral component is steady in time .",
    "if so , the pulsed fraction of the light curve at a given energy and epoch @xmath101 can be expressed as a linear combination of two light curves of fixed pulsed fractions @xmath102 and @xmath103 weighted by the ratio of counts from the respective spectral component @xmath104 and @xmath105 ,    @xmath106 + f_{bb2}\\,r(e , t ) } } , \\label{pf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath107 $ ] is the normalized flux ratio .",
    "this expression is only valid in the case that the minima of the two light curves coincide , as is evident for the  profiles .",
    "for an exponential decay of the component luminosities , the time - dependent model for the pulsed fraction is simply ,    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the flux ratio at time @xmath110 and @xmath111  d is the differential time constant .",
    "we can test this hypothesis directly by fitting for @xmath102 and @xmath103 using a joint least - squares fit to the set of 24 ( six energy bands at four epochs ) measured pulsed fractions @xmath101 given in table  [ pulsefit ] and the ratio @xmath112 for the double blackbody spectral model tabulated in table  [ specratio ] . treating the ratio @xmath112 as the independent variable , the best fit yields @xmath113 for the hotter component and @xmath114 for the cooler one .",
    "the fit statistic is @xmath115 for 22 degrees - of - freedom , corresponding to a probability @xmath116 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .  [ history ] shows the best fit model for the decay of the the 1.01.5  kev pulsed fraction over time and its extrapolation to an epoch dominated by the warm spectral component . on the other hand ,",
    "if we apply the blackbody plus power - law model , the corresponding values of @xmath112 , also listed in table  [ specratio ] , are completely different and the result is @xmath117 for 22 degrees - of - freedom , corresponding to a probability @xmath118 , 13 times less likely relative to the double blackbody model , for the assumption of fixed intrinsic pulsed fractions .",
    "evidently the pulsed fraction of the hotter component is much higher than for the cooler component .",
    "this difference would account for the gradual shift from a sharper , more triangular pulse shape found at higher energies , to a rounder and more symmetric sinusoidal light curve seen at lower energies .",
    "as was hypothesized above , the decrease in pulsed fraction with time at low energies follows from the fact that the hot spectral component is decaying more rapidly than the cooler one , and so its contribution to the pulsed fraction in the low - energy bin is declining . to the extent that we are not able to discern differences greater than @xmath119 , which represents the measurement uncertainty , the pulsed fractions @xmath102 and @xmath103 are individually independent of energy .",
    "however , we also can not rule out a model in which @xmath102 itself increases with increasing energy .",

    "even if such a sharp cutoff existed at the low end of the epic energy band , a model in which the power - law component is due to compton upscattering of thermal x - rays from the surface does not explain why most of the power - law photons have lower energy than the observed blackbody photons unless there is a larger source of seed photons at energies below 0.5  kev .",
    "however , such a seed source would have to be thermal emission from the neutron star . since the two - temperature model uses a large fraction of the surface area for the @xmath239  kev photons ,",
    "we prefer to regard the x - rays in this band as plausible seeds for , rather than as the product of , inverse compton scattering . supporting this assumption in the specific case of",
    "are the shapes of its pulse profiles .",
    "the smooth increase in pulsed fraction with energy , and the strict phase alignment at all energies , are unnatural under the hypothesis of two different emission mechanisms and locations .",
    "the evolving spectral shape and pulse profiles of  during its decline from outburst offer new and complementary evidence concerning the appropriate spectral decomposition .",
    "we find that the the pulsed fraction is declining with time at low energies , while remaining essentially constant at high energies .",
    "this fact is consistent with the changing contributions of fluxes in the two - temperature fit as the two components decline at different rates .",
    "the warm and hot components contribute significantly to the soft x - rays , whereas the hard x - rays are supplied entirely by the hot component .",
    "this is quantified in table  [ specratio ] , where it is seen that the hot blackbody component accounts for 3060% of the flux below 1.5 kev , and @xmath240 of the flux above 3  kev at all times . under this spectral decomposition , the pulsed fraction at energies above 3  kev is large and unchanging because one and only one spectral component is present at those energies , and it has the larger pulsed fraction of the two spectral components . in contrast , the pulsed fraction at low energies ( @xmath241 kev ) is understood to decrease in time because the hot component makes only a fractional contribution to its light curve , and its fraction decreases faster than the warm spectral component , which has the intrinsically smaller pulsed fraction .",
    "this effect is also illustrated in figure  [ history ] , where the modeled pulse fraction is compared to the data .",
    "0.15 in    0.15 in    0.05 in    in contrast , consider how the spectral components would contribute to the various energy bands in the power - law plus blackbody spectral model .",
    "table 3 shows that , unlike the two blackbody model , a fitted power - law component accounts for 79% of the soft ( @xmath241  kev ) x - rays at _ all _ epochs , while decreasing its contribution to the hard ( @xmath242  kev ) x - rays over time . in this model ,",
    "the pulsed fraction should remain constant at low energies because only the power law is present there , while at high energies the pulsed fraction should vary because both the blackbody and the power - law components are present , in varying proportions .",
    "this spectral decomposition would drive an evolution of the pulse shapes that is opposite of what is observed .",
    "thus , we find that the detailed evolution of the x - ray emission from  further supports the assumption of a purely thermal surface emission model , and leaves no evidence of a steep power law in the @xmath243  kev band , as is commonly fitted to individual observations of axps .",
    "our decomposition of the pulsed light curves is also consistent with the absence of modulation in the _ rosat _  observation of 1992 march 7 , to an observed upper limit of 24% in the @xmath244   kev pspc energy band .",
    "since the _ rosat _  spectrum is fitted by an even cooler blackbody of @xmath96  kev , it can be expected that the pulsed fraction in quiescence will fall below the 25% value fitted to the warm blackbody in _ xmm - newton _  data once that component fades away .      for consistency with papers i and ii",
    ", we have parameterized results here in terms of a distance of 5  kpc .",
    "however , this was considered an upper limit based on an absorption kinematic distance to the neighboring supernova remnant g11.2@xmath2450.3 @xcite and its x - ray measured column density @xmath246  @xmath8 @xcite . in comparison , the column density fitted to a power - law plus blackbody model for  was @xmath247  @xmath8 . since on physical grounds we strongly prefer the double blackbody model , which requires @xmath248  @xmath8 , it seems appropriate to reduce the distance estimate to one that is more compatible with the smaller @xmath23 value .",
    "we now assume that the distance to  is 2.5  kpc , and explore the consequences of this revision .",
    "the effect is to reduce the inferred x - ray luminosities and blackbody surface areas . for @xmath249  kpc ,",
    "the surface area emitting the warm blackbody component is @xmath250  @xmath8 at all times , which is less than 1/6 the area of a neutron star .",
    "this makes it easier to understand how the pulsed fraction of the softest x - rays can be as large as @xmath251 .",
    "we can also revise the estimate of the total energy emitted in the outburst . at a distance of 2.5  kpc ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity quoted in paper ii is @xmath252 ergs  s@xmath9 with respect to the initial time @xmath253 of the outburst observed by _",
    "rxte_@xcite , which corresponds to an extrapolated energy of @xmath254 ergs .",
    "since _ rxte _  is only sensitive to the hotter blackbody component , we should add another contribution from the _ xmm - newton _  measured warm component , which can be estimated as @xmath255 ergs  s@xmath9 .",
    "the extrapolation required to integrate the contribution of the warm component is less certain than for the hot component , but it corresponds to an energy of only @xmath256 ergs .",
    "the total estimated energy is then @xmath257 ergs , which is comparable to the amount of heat assumed to be deposited in the crust during a deep heating event @xcite , or the extra energy stored in an azimuthally twisted external magnetic field @xcite . in the following section , we discuss how the observations might probe the actual mechanism of the outburst .",
    "two mechanisms have been invoked to explain the late - time `` afterglow '' of an outburst of a magnetar .",
    "the first involves surface heating by long - lived currents flowing on closed but azimuthally twisted external magnetic field lines , and comptonization of the resulting surface x - ray emission by the same particles @xcite .",
    "the originating event could be a sudden fracture in the crust in response to twisting of the internal magnetic field , or a plastic deformation of the crust that gradually transfers internal magnetic twist to the external field .",
    "it is thought that the major outbursts of sgrs are magnetically trapped fireballs triggered by a sudden fracture , but this is not known to apply to  because no bursting behavior was seen , and no prior rotational ephemeris exists to test for a glitch . in any case , the extra energy above that of a pure dipole , @xmath258 , stored in a twisted magnetic field external to the star is ,    @xmath259    where @xmath260  rad is the azimuthal twist from north to south hemisphere @xcite .",
    "this is enough to account for the extrapolated @xmath261 ergs radiated if @xmath262 is a small fraction of a radian .    in this model ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is a combination of surface thermal emission , and compton scattering and cyclotron resonant scattering of the thermal x - rays .",
    "compton upscattered flux may result in power - law emission that dominates at high energies such as that reported above 10  kev for the axp in kes  73 @xcite .",
    "however , the flat power - law index ( @xmath263 ) does not contribute to the softer spectrum , in particular below 2  kev .",
    "so we consider that the potential power - law tail in the fainter  may no be detectable yet .",
    "the decay timescale is determined by the rate at which power is consumed by the magnetospheric currents , which is comparable to that needed to power the observed x - ray luminosities of axps in general and  in outburst .",
    "furthermore , it is the evolution of surface heating that basically determines the instantaneous x - ray luminosity and its decay , but more specific predictions of decay curves have not been made .    in the second picture , a deep crustal heating event , heat deposited suddenly by rearrangement of the magnetic field",
    "is gradually transferred by diffusion and radiation , and the radiated x - rays are purely thermal . while the originating event might have been a fracture of the crust as in the first scenario , an assumption that the heat is evenly distributed throughout the crust results in a particular decay curve from one - dimensional models of heat transfer @xcite . in this model , the heating is virtually instantaneous , within @xmath264  s , while it is the rate of conduction cooling that determines the observed decay curve .",
    "@xcite assumed a deposition of @xmath265 ergs  @xmath266 to a depth of 500  m , which is @xmath267 of the magnetic energy density at the surface . if occurring over the entire crust ,",
    "this is @xmath268 ergs , comparable to the total x - ray energy emitted during the decay of .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the resulting cooling luminosity would follow a @xmath269 power law , which is rather slow compared to the observed exponential decay of the hot component of , while 80% of the energy should be conducted into the neutron star core rather than radiated from the surface .",
    "it is not obvious if the behavior of  supports or excludes either of these models .",
    "one interesting possibility is that the slowly decaying warm component is the radiation from a deep heating event that affected a large fraction of the crust , while the hot component of the spectrum is powered by external surface heating at the foot - points of twisted magnetic field lines by magnetospheric currents that are decaying more rapidly .",
    "it is not yet clear if the flux decay of the warm component is primarily an effect of decreasing temperature or decreasing area , because the decay has so far been modest .",
    "it is possible that the decay of the warm component _ is _ consistent with a @xmath269 power law rather than an exponential of @xmath2  days .",
    "fits to @xmath270 as a function of time allows a power - law decay index in the range @xmath271 to @xmath272 .",
    "in contrast , because of its more rapid decay , it is evident that the hotter component is declining exponentially , in area rather than in temperature .",
    "this shrinking in area might be easier to understand as a decay of the currents or a rearrangement of the magnetic field lines that are channeling the heating on the surface .",
    "but there is no good evidence yet of an inverse compton scattered component from the particles responsible for that current , at least not at energies @xmath273  kev .",
    "perhaps the solid angle subtended by the twisted field lines in the magnetosphere is too small to scatter most of the thermal photons .",
    "each of the models is challenged in some aspect by the observations , but each may still have some applicability . observing the decay through to quiescence should help to clarify the situation .",
    "the pulsed light curves offer an additional diagnostic of the emission and viewing geometry . if we adopt the hypothesis that virtually all of the @xmath243  kev flux is surface thermal emission , then the symmetry of the light curves and their strict pulse - phase alignment as a function of energy argue for a concentric geometry in which a small hot spot is surrounded by a larger , warmer region . the large observed pulsed fractions are achievable in a realistically modeled ns atmosphere that accounts for the different opacities of the normal modes of polarization in a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "many geometries were modeled by @xcite , but only total pulsed fractions were reported rather than detailed light curves .",
    "it is important to model the pulse profiles completely , since the number of peaks and their phase relationship depend in detail on the surface and viewing geometry .",
    "in addition , the relative effects of fan versus pencil beaming , as regulated by the anisotropic opacity in a strong magnetic field , allow the number of peaks in the light curve to differ from the number of hot spots on the surface . whereas the pulsed fraction of the hot component in  is 53% , this is not high enough to require a single spot .",
    "it is possible that the flat interpulse region of the triangular , hard x - ray pulse is actually emission from an antipodal spot at large viewing angle .",
    "@xcite showed that for large magnetic fields , most of the flux would be in a broad fan beam , while @xcite argue that cyclotron resonant scattering in the magnetosphere can significantly reduce this effect .",
    "detailed physical modeling of the pulse profiles of  is needed before definite conclusions about the emission and viewing geometries can be drawn .",
    "four sets of _ xmm - newton _  observations of  spanning a year , clarify several new behaviors that might apply to other axps and axp - like objects :    * a two - temperature blackbody model is arguably preferred over the standard blackbody+power law model , * the components of the compound spectrum are decaying at rates that differ significantly , and * the component temperatures of the blackbody emission are nearly constant , implying that the area of emission is steadily decreasing .",
    "several outstanding questions remain that can be addressed by continuing x - ray observations of  over the next few years .",
    "will the current spectrum evolve into the prior quiescent one ? is the cool quiescent spectrum still present so that it will begin to dominate over the warm temperature component ? to what degree is the quiescent emission pulsed ? why do the temperatures hardly change with time , requiring the apparent decrease in area ?",
    "what is the emission geometry on the ns and what can we learn from it ?",
    "future observations will test our predictions for the flux decay and pulsed fractions and allow a better understanding of the relationship between the spectral components and the pulse profile .",
    "ultimately , the goal of this study is to disentangle the processes of thermal and non - thermal emission to which magnetars convert their energy , during outburst and quiescence .",
