    "this treatment was first applied with some success to @xmath41 @xcite and later to @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "although these two values are only marginally consistent within our model , the whole situation looks rather satisfactory if one takes into account the simplicity of our approach and the well known difficulties one has to face in scalar meson physics .",

    "the range of values for @xmath179 is thus considerably restricted regardless the expression adopted for the @xmath11 propagator .",
    "in turn , such small values for @xmath209 imply a large @xmath210 coupling which , in principle , should clearly manifest in the low part of the dipion mass spectrum .",
    "but this is not the case in a l@xmath211 m approach like ours where the @xmath3 contribution contains a @xmath212 coupling which is proportional to @xmath14 and thus almost vanishing .",
    "this depletion effect of the @xmath3 is somehow visible in the da@xmath7ne data which show very small values for @xmath213 in the @xmath214 mev region .",
    "indeed , the chiral - loop amplitude ( without scalar poles ) plus the vmd background are known to predict values @xcite which are two or three times larger than the data in this range of masses .",
    "this feature , namely , the prediction of small @xmath212 and large @xmath210 couplings ( because of their proportionality to @xmath14 and to @xmath215 , respectively ) is specific of our l@xmath211 m approach .",
    "it admits a crucial and simple test .",
    "contrary to what happens for @xmath33 around 500 mev in @xmath5 decays , data on @xmath216 dominated in this case by pion rather than kaon loops should show a non - suppressed @xmath15 contribution around @xmath217 mev @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the recently published data on @xmath5 decays can be reasonably described in a rather simple context based on the complementary between chpt and the l@xmath10 m .",
