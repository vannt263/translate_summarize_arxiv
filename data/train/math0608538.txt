    "a _ polyhedral map _ on a surface is a ( finite ) set of polygons ( with at least three sides ) , which are glued together ( topologically ) along edges to form the surface , such that there are no self - identifications on the boundaries of the polygons , and two polygons are either disjoint or intersect in exactly one edge or one vertex only .",
    "we thus can think of a polyhedral map as a combinatorial model for a surface .    for a given polyhedral map it is natural to try to visualize it as a _ polyhedron _ in three - space or in higherdimensional space @xmath5 , such that every polygon is the convex hull of its vertices and two polygons are either disjoint in @xmath5 , they intersect in a common edge and are not coplanar , or they intersect in a common vertex only .",
    "such a realization usually is called a _ geometric _ or _ polyhedral realization _ , with straight edges , plane polygons , and no non - trivial intersections ( with neighboring polygons being not coplanar ) .",

    "for example , _ simple polyhedral maps _",

    "a `` realization '' of this @xmath15-@xmath14-torus with flat , but non - convex @xmath15-gons was given by szilassi @xcite , the _ szilassi - torus_.    betke and gritzmann @xcite found a further combinatorial obstruction to geometric realizability : let @xmath17 be any subset of the set of odd valent vertices of a polyhedral map @xmath18 and let @xmath19 be the set of facets containing some vertex of @xmath17 . if @xmath20 , then @xmath18 is not realizable in any @xmath5 .",
    "again , the betke - gritzmann obstruction rules out realizability of @xmath15-@xmath14-equivelar maps on the torus , but the obstruction was also used by mcmullen , schulz , and wills @xcite to show non - realizability for other , non - simple families of equivelar maps .    in a _ simplicial map _ ( i.e. , a triangulation of a surface as a simplicial complex ) every triangle contains at most three odd valent vertices , from which it can be deduced that @xmath21 for every subset @xmath17 of odd valent vertices .",
    "thus , the betke - gritzmann obstruction can not be applied to simplicial maps to show non - realizability .",
    "grnbaum @xcite proposed in 1967 that every triangulated torus should be geometrically realizable in @xmath0 .",
    "his famous conjecture was open for 40 years and was proved in 2007 by archdeacon , bonnington , and ellis - monaghan @xcite . for the class of triangulations of the projective plane with one face removed geometric realizability in @xmath0 was proved in 2008 by bonnington and nakamoto @xcite .",
    "however , not every triangulated mbius strip needs to be realizable in @xmath0 , a  counterexample is due to by brehm @xcite .    until rather recently ,",
    "no computational tools were available _ to actually find realizations _ for simplicial surfaces .",
    "in the past 30 years the most promising approach to obtain a polyhedral realization in @xmath0 for a given triangulation was to try to _ build a physical model _",

    "very basic heuristic procedures for finding realizations in @xmath0 for larger classes of examples were used by fendrich @xcite ( to show that all triangulated tori with up to 11 vertices are realizable via embeddings in the @xmath6-skeleta of random @xmath22-polytopes ) and lutz @xcite ( to obtain realizations for triangulations of the orientable surface of genus @xmath6 via choosing coordinates randomly ) .",
    "these methods , although useful in processing larger numbers of examples , are less powerful than human imagination leading to a physical model .",
    "for example , @xmath23 of the @xmath24 vertex - minimal triangulations of the orientable surface of genus @xmath6 were realized with the random realization method in @xcite , with a total computation time of 30 cpu months .",
    "however , it was not possible to randomly realize the remaining example ( with the highest combinatorial symmetry of the 865 examples ) .",
    "the computer search was run unsuccessfully for more than a month before the example was realized within a day by bokowski @xcite with the rubber band method .    in this paper",
    ", we present a heuristic algorithm for finding polyhedral realizations for ( closed , orientable ) simplicial surfaces in @xmath0 , which , for the first time , surpasses the physical approach with respect to its processing time and its qualitative range of examples . in particular , we show that all vertex - minimal triangulations of the orientable surfaces of genus @xmath1 and @xmath2 are realizable .",
    "we also provide examples of vertex - minimal simplicial polyhedra of genus @xmath3 with @xmath4 vertices .",
    "in the following section we give a brief survey on realizability results for surfaces , vertex - minimal triangulations , and algorithmic aspects of deciding realizability .",

    "polyhedral surfaces that are obtained by projections ( of @xmath6-dimensional subcomplexes ) of higherdimensional polytopes together with obstructions to projectability are discussed by rrig , sanyal , and ziegler  @xcite .",

    "( i.e. , triangulations with the minimal possible number of vertices ) of the real projective plane @xmath56 with @xmath15 vertices and of the @xmath6-torus with @xmath16 vertices ( mbius torus @xcite ) were already known in the 19th century , but it took until 1955 to complete the construction of series of examples of vertex - minimal triangulations for all non - orientable surfaces ( ringel  @xcite ) and until 1980 for all orientable surfaces ( jungerman and ringel  @xcite ) .    if a given triangulation of an orientable surface is realizable in @xmath0 , then so are subdivisions of it that are obtained by successively subdividing edges and triangles .",
    "hence , vertex - minimal triangulations apparently are good candidates for non - realizable simplicial maps .",

    "theoretically , the second step can be done algorithmically ( for example , with collins _ cylindrical algebraic decomposition _ algorithm @xcite ) . in practice , however , there are no methods known that would work sufficiently fast to yield results even for small examples .",

    "the complexity of the realization problem restricted to simplicial maps is unknown .",
    "in fact , it was open for a long time , whether there are non - realizable examples at all .    in a major breakthrough , bokowski and guedes",
    "de oliveira @xcite showed in 2000 ( using 10 cpu years ) that one of the @xmath61 vertex - minimal @xmath4-vertex triangulations of the orientable surface of genus  @xmath15 has no compatible orientable matroid and therefore is not realizable .",
    "schewe @xcite substantially improved the enumeration of compatible orientable matroids and was able to verify that , in fact , all @xmath61 vertex - minimal @xmath4-vertex triangulations of the orientable surface of genus @xmath15 are non - realizable .",
    "moreover , he found three examples of non - realizable vertex - minimal @xmath4-vertex triangulations of the orientable surface of genus  @xmath3 . at  least for one of these examples it is possible to remove a triangle from the triangulation while maintaining non - realizability .",
    "connected sums with other triangulations then still are non - realizable .",
    "hence , for every orientable surface of genus @xmath62 there are triangulations that can not be realized geometrically in @xmath0 .",
    "apart from the approach via oriented matroids , non - realizability results ( for simplicial maps in @xmath0 ) seem to be difficult to achieve : novik @xcite associated an integer program with a given triangulation , which , if it has no solution , yields non - realizability .",
    "improved systems have been proposed by timmreck @xcite .",
    "so far , however , all tested systems for orientable surfaces either had solutions or turned out to be computationally intractable . in a different approach ,",
    "brehm @xcite used a linking number argument to show that there is a non - realizable triangulation of the mbius strip with @xmath63 vertices .",

    "@xmath22 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 vertices , respectively , were constructed _ by hand _ by brehm @xcite and bokowski and brehm @xcite .",
    "some of these examples were found by exploiting combinatorial symmetries of the triangulations , others with the _ rubber band technique _ of bokowski @xcite .    a simple computer heuristic ( _ by choosing coordinates randomly _ ) was used in  @xcite to show that @xmath23 of the @xmath24 examples of vertex - minimal triangulations of the orientable surface of genus @xmath6 are realizable .",

    "the conjecture holds for genus @xmath82 ( steinitz @xcite ) and for genus @xmath59 ( archdeacon , bonnington , and ellis - monaghan  @xcite ) .",
    "we also tried our program on some triangulations of tori with more vertices .",
    "it turned out that it still is possible to find realizations , although it takes much longer for every step of the local search process : there are @xmath83 pairs of triangles that have to be considered for the computation , respectively for the update , of the intersection segment functional .",

    "* section 12.2 ) ) allows to obtain corresponding realizations algorithmically via first constructing a planar equilibrium representation of the edge graph of a given map .",

    "we give a simple modification of our realization heuristic in order to obtain _ convex realizations _ of triangulated @xmath6-spheres .",

    "hence , by adding to the intersection segment functional the lengths of intersection segments for all pairs of triangles consisting of a triangle of the triangulation and a triangle that does not belong to the triangulation the resulting _ extended intersection segment functional _ can be used to obtain convex realizations for triangulated @xmath6-spheres . to be more precise :    if a triangulated @xmath6-sphere has no vertex of degree @xmath14 , then the extended intersection segment functional is zero if and only if a convex realization ( with vertices in general positions ) has been reached .",
    "for the other direction , assume that the functional is zero and that the vertices are in general position . in case",

    "the line segment the two triangles intersect in contributes a positive value to the extended intersection segment functional , contradiction . if @xmath80 has degree  @xmath22 , then there are two cases . if the star of the vertex @xmath80 contains a vertex different from @xmath92 , then again at least one of the triangles in the star of @xmath80 intersects some triangle of the boundary of the tetrahedron @xmath88 , contradiction .",
    "else , let @xmath93 be a vertex outside the convex hull of the vertices @xmath92",
    ". then @xmath80 lies in the convex hull of @xmath93 and some triangle @xmath94 of the tetrahedron @xmath88 .",
    "but then the vertex star of @xmath80 contains the vertex @xmath95 , which lies outside the tetrahedron spanned by the vertices @xmath96 .",
    "this again leads to a contradiction.@xmath97    in case a triangulation has vertices of degree @xmath14 , non - convex realizations of the triangulation can have vanishing extended intersection segment functional .",
    "the smallest such example is the bipyramid over a triangle with one apex pushed inside the convex hull of the other four vertices .",
    "nevertheless , we can recursively remove vertices of degree @xmath14 from a given triangulation .",
    "the resulting triangulation then either is the boundary of a tetrahedron or a triangulation with vertices all of degree at least four . after obtaining a realization for the simplified triangulation",
    ", the removed vertices can be added back by placing them suitably `` above '' the triangles which they subdivide .",
    "we successfully tested our approach for some small triangulations of @xmath7 : there are @xmath98 triangulations of @xmath7 with @xmath64 vertices of which @xmath4 examples have no vertices of degree @xmath14 .",
    "it took , on average , about @xmath3 minutes to obtain convex realizations for these @xmath4 triangulations .    _ remark : _ although our main focus in this paper was on the realization of closed , orientable triangulated surfaces , the intersection segment functional can , of course , also be used to search for realizations in three - space for other @xmath6-dimensional simplicial complexes .",
