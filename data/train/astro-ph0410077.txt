    "x - ray astronomy has come a long way since the first detection of x - ray emission from an extra - solar object in 1962@xcite . in the meantime ,",
    "x - ray astronomy has emerged as one of the drivers of modern astronomy , as evident from the award of the nobel prize in physics to x - ray pioneer riccardo giacconi in 2002 , and the existence of two major x - ray observatories , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , orbiting earth since 1999 .",
    "the most important results of x - ray astronomy have so far been obtained from observations in the `` soft '' x - ray band with photon energies between 0.1 kev and several kev . to mention several important milestones , the _ einstein _ observatory@xcite achieved in 1978 a first breakthrough in the 0.2 kev to 4 kev band by combining a grazing incidence mirror with position sensitive detectors .",
    "the observatory carried a `` high resolution imager '' ( hri ) , consisting of two cascaded micro channel plates ( mcp ) read out by a crossed - grid charge detector .",
    "another main instrument was the imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) , a 4 cm deep , 800 torr ar - xe - co@xmath2 proportional counter which achieved a modest energy resolution of between 50% and 100% .",
    "the grazing incidence mirror and the hri achieved an effective detection area of 10 @xmath3 . the mirror and the ipc had a detection area of 100 @xmath3 .",
    "the _ roentgen satellite ( rosat ) _ was launched in 1990 and used similar detectors as the _ einstein _ observatory .",
    "its hri and ipc cameras collected respectively 8 and 2.4 times more photons per unit time than their _ einstein _ counterparts@xcite .",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites are equipped with powerful x - ray grazing incidence mirrors and state - of - the - art photon detectors .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "satellite carries the _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis)_@xcite made of si - ccds with energy resolutions of between 2% and 10% over the energy range from 0.1 kev to 10 kev . the _ xmm - newton _",
    "satellite carries two conventional metal oxide semiconductor ( mos ) cameras , and a `` pn '' camera@xcite .",
    "the fully depleted @xmath4 ccds ( 280 micron deep depletion region ) can detect x - rays with energies up to 15 kev .",
    "chandra _ x - ray mirror and acis camera achieve a 1 kev detection area of 340 @xmath3 and an unique angular resolution of 0.5  .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ mirrors and ccd cameras have a combined 1 kev detection area of 2,100 @xmath3 and an angular resolution of 15  .",
    "compared to the soft x - ray band , the hard x - ray band ( @xmath0 20 - 200 kev ) has progressed more slowly .",
    "hard x - rays are more difficult to focus , scintillation detectors had only modest spatial and energy resolutions , and ge detectors required resource intensive cryogenic cooling",
    ". the _ high energy astrophysics observatory-1 ( heao-1 ) _ was equipped with a 1.4@xmath5 @xmath1 20@xmath5 fan collimator and 250  @xmath3 of nai scintillator , and scanned the hard x - ray sky in the years 1977 - 1979 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_@xcite launched in 1995 and _ satellite per astronomia x , `` beppo '' ( bepposax)_@xcite launched in 1996 used essentially the same detector technology with 1@xmath5 pencil beam collimators .",
    "the wide bandgap semiconductors cadmium telluride ( cdte ) and cadmium zinc telluride ( czt ) are now boosting the field of hard x - ray astronomy .",
    "the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral)_@xcite launched in 2002 carries the _ imager on board the integral satellite ( ibis ) _ that uses cdte detectors with a detector area of @xmath02,600 @xmath3 .",
    "the _ swift _",
    "satellite@xcite , to be launched in october 2004 , carries the _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) _ with a czt detection area of @xmath05,240 @xmath3 .",
    "the _ ibis _ and the _ bat _ use the approach of coded mask imaging . embedded in a collimator assembly ,",
    "the detectors see the sky through a patterned shadow mask .",
    "the detectors image the sum of all shadows cast by the x - ray sources in the field of view .",
    "a deconvolution algorithm is used to derive the x - ray surface brightness distribution from the detected image . in this approach ,",
    "the effective detection area is roughly half of the active detector area ( the other half of the detector area is covered by the coded mask ) , and is not given by the collection area of any focusing optics .    the congressionally approved beyond einstein program@xcite of nasa s `` structure and evolution of the universe '' theme plans for two major x - ray missions . in both missions , czt plays an important role .",
    "the constellation - x observatory @xcite will perform high throughput x - ray spectroscopy with high energy and angular resolution over the energy range from 0.25 kev to 10 kev employing x - ray gratings with si - ccds , as well as non - dispersive microcalorimeters .",
    "the design includes a hard x - ray telescope that uses czt detectors to cover the energy range from 6  kev to 40 kev or higher .",
    "constellation - x is currently receiving nasa funds for pre - phase a development , the `` advanced concepts '' phase .",
    "given the current budget plan , the mission will be launched in 2016@xcite . a second recommended mission is the `` black hole finder probe '' , a large field of view , hard x - ray telescope .",
    "the _ energetic x - ray imaging survey telescope ( exist ) _",
    "design@xcite proposes an assembly of coded mask imagers .",
    "hard x - rays are detected with @xmath00.5  cm thick czt detectors with a total detector area of @xmath080,000 @xmath3 .",
    "_ exist _ has been selected for a 2-year nasa concept study , along with the _ coded aperture survey telescope for energetic radiation ( caster)_@xcite , a competitor design which employs the new scintillators labr@xmath6 or lacl@xmath6 as primary detectors .",
    "there is no definitive time schedule for the black hole finder probe , as its funding is presently beyond the budgetary horizon of 2009@xcite . in this paper , we emphasize thick czt detectors and their application in _ exist_-type hard x - ray telescopes . in sect .",
    "[ requirements ] we will discuss key requirements for czt detectors in this application . in sect .",
    "[ standard ] we scrutinize the performance of in contacted standard detectors from imarad .",
    "furthermore , we present detailed detector simulations and compare simulated data with experimentally measured data . in sect .",
    "[ contacts ] we give first results of contacting the detectors with cr , ag , au , and pt . finally , in sect .",
    "[ summary ] , we summarize our findings and describe work in progress .",
    "presently , major vendors of czt substrates are ev products@xcite , imarad@xcite , and bicron@xcite .",
    "ev products and bicron use the high - pressure bridgman ( hpb ) process to grow the substrates , while imarad uses the modified high - pressure bridgman ( mhpb ) process . while hpb and mhpb czt achieve similar performances at high energies , mhpb detectors give poorer results at low energies .",
    "the latter can in part be explained by the higher resistivity of hpb crystals ( @xmath02@xmath7 ohm - cm ) compared to mhpb crystals ( @xmath0@xmath8 ohm - cm ) that results in lower leakage currents .",
    "an alternative to czt might be cdte@xcite .",
    "an advantage of cdte is that large uniform single crystals can be grown .",
    "although cdte detectors require cooling to temperatures of -20@xmath5c to achieve good performances , such temperatures can easily be maintained in space .      in the following ,",
    "we discuss the requirements for 0.5  cm thick czt detectors used for the detection of 10 kev to 600 kev photons in space - borne x - rays telescopes .",
    "+ _ photopeak efficiency : _ a crucial detector parameter is the photopeak efficiency @xmath9 .",
    "the detector area required to achieve a certain flux sensitivity scales with @xmath10 ; the mass and cost of the full satellite can depend even more strongly on @xmath9 . even in a fully depleted detector and after full depth of interaction ( doi ) correction , not all photo - effect events show up in the measured energy spectra .",
    "the main culprit is most probably `` dead detector regions '' .",
    "owing to non - negligible surface conductivity , not all electric field lines end at the anode pixels : some end in - between pixels@xcite .",
    "electron clouds drifting to the area between pixels induce less charge on the anode contacts than clouds drifting to the anode contacts themselves .",
    "while large pixels minimize the dead volume , they usually do not give ideal energy resolutions .",
    "the volume of the dead regions can be reduced by passivating the detectors after contact deposition .",
    "another approach is to use negatively biased steering contacts located between the anode contacts to steer the electrons toward the anode contacts .",
    "+ _ energy and spatial resolutions : _ the best reported energy resolutions of 0.5 mm thick czt detectors are about 3 kev at 59 kev and 7 kev at 662 kev@xcite .",
    "the _ exist _ design foresees pixellated detectors with a pixel pitch of about 1.25  mm to achieve an angular resolution of between 2 and 5. pixellated detectors are preferred , as they exhibit lower lead capacitance and lower leakage currents than strip detectors .",
    "doi resolution of 1% or better is required to assure that the anode signals can be corrected for any existing doi dependence .",
    "an important fact to notice is that energy resolutions below @xmath0100 kev are typically dominated by electronic noise ( produced by the detector itself ) and readout noise .",
    "the energy resolutions above @xmath0 100 kev are dominated by crystal inhomogeneities and the dependence of the induced charge on the location of the photon absorption .",
    "thus , a detector performing well at low energies does not necessarily perform well at high energies and vice versa . while present czt technology gives",
    "high - energy resolutions that are sufficient for most astrophysical applications , a substantial improvement of the low - energy resolution would be very welcomed .",
    "+ _ temperature range and mechanical ruggedness : _ in space , czt detectors can conveniently be operated at temperatures between -50@xmath5c and 0@xmath5c .",
    "most czt detectors show better performance at such low temperatures than at room temperatures .",
    "however , some imarad mhpb detectors equipped with blocking contacts basically stopped working at temperatures of about -10@xmath5c@xcite .",
    "the detectors should also be rugged enough to withstand vibrations during the launch of the spacecraft",
    ". +     test set - up for evaluation of the czt detector performance ( washington university ) .",
    "the hybrid read - out system consists of a low - noise asic readout for 16 pixels and a fast ( 100 mhz analog bandwidth ) readout for 3 pixels and the cathode ; pixels which are not read out are held at ground potential.,title=\"fig:\",width=476 ]    _ radiation hardness : _ space - borne detectors suffer year long exposures to trapped charged particles , cosmic rays , and neutrons that damage the detectors and make them radioactive .",
    "several groups have studied the radiation damage of czt detectors produced by high energy protons@xcite .",
    "a 200 mev proton dose of @xmath010@xmath11 @xmath12 decreases the electron @xmath13 product by 20% to 40% and reduces the charge yield by 10% to 20%@xcite .",
    "wong et al .",
    "( 1996)@xcite reported that annealing the detectors to about 100@xmath5c can be used to undo the damage .",
    "fraboni et al .",
    "( 2003)@xcite irradiated czt detectors with large doses of @xmath14-rays , electrons ( 9  mev ) , thermal ( @xmath01 ev ) and fast ( @xmath01 mev ) neutrons , and protons ( 2 mev ) .",
    "using photo induced current transient spectroscopy they find that the degradation of the detector performance ( increase in leakage current , loss of energy resolution , and shift of the photopeak to lower energies ) is linked to the appearance of very specific deep energy levels .",
    "+ _ activation : _ substrate activation is a serious concern for thick detectors . a number of background measurements have been made in several balloon flights@xcite .",
    "slavis et al .",
    "( 2000)@xcite monitored the background during a 21  hrs long 104,000 ft high balloon flight and used the data to derive upper limits on the activation of a czt detector .",
    "murakami et al .  ( 2003)@xcite activated a cdte detector with 155 mev protons and subsequently identified a large number of radio - active elements with a ge detector and the cdte detector itself .",
    "although several monte carlo studies of czt activation on different time scales have been published@xcite , there are no long - term activation data to test the simulations . the _ integral _ and _ swift _ missions will provide data sets to improve on this situation .",
    "in this section , we discuss the performance of standard imarad detectors .",
    "the 2@xmath12@xmath10.5  cm detectors are contacted with 8 @xmath1 8 in pixels on the anode side and a monolithic in cathode .",
    "the pixels have a diameter of 1.6  mm and the pixel pitch is 2.4 mm .",
    "the detectors have a conducting band around their perimeter .",
    "even when left floating , the band improves the photopeak efficiency and energy resolution of the outer pixels .",
    "we concentrate on the performance of central pixels .",

    "we mount the detectors using gold plated pogo - pin contacts on both , the anode and the cathode sides . the cathode is negatively biased , and the anode pixels are held at ground .",
    "we use a hybrid electronic readout ( see fig .  [ mounting ] ) .",
    "four channels ( 3 anode pixels plus the cathode ) are ac coupled and are amplified by a fast amptek 250 amplifier followed by a second amplifier stage .",
    "the amplified signals are digitized by a 500 mhz oscilloscope and transferred to a pc via ethernet .",
    "the time resolved readout enables us to measure the drift time of electrons through the detector to a resolution of 10 ns .",
    "we use a 16 channel asic from ev products@xcite to measure pulse height information for 16 additional pixels .",
