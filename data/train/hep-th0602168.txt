    "the inflationary scenario predicts the existence of a gravitational wave background produced quantum - mechanically  @xcite , in much the same way as the mechanism of generating density perturbations . detecting the inflationary gravitational wave background is a grand challenge for lisa  @xcite , bbo  @xcite , and other missions  @xcite .",
    "it will open up a new window into the very early universe , and thus in principle the possibility of recently proposed braneworld models  @xcite can be tested using the inflationary gravitational waves .    a number of studies have been done aiming at obtaining a clear picture of the generation and evolution of gravitational waves in the randall - sundrum braneworld  @xcite .",
    "de sitter inflation on the brane  @xcite is a special case where the perturbation equation is separable and exactly solvable .",
    "it predicts a flat primordial spectrum , as in four - dimensional general relativity , but the amplitude is enhanced at high energies . for more general inflation models",
    ", the tilted primordial spectrum can be calculated from the corresponding four - dimensional one by a mapping formula  @xcite .",
    "the late time evolution of gravitational wave perturbations at low energies is very close to that in conventional cosmology  @xcite , recovering four - dimensional general relativity when the relevant length scales are lager than the bulk curvature scale @xmath0 .",
    "what is much more interesting is the evolution of gravitational waves during the high energy regime , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter .",
    "in addition to the rather trivial effect of the unconventional background expansion rate , the nontrivial effect of mode mixing may not be negligible , converting a zero mode into a kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode and vice versa efficiently at high energies . to clarify the evolution of subhorizon modes during the high energy regime ,",
    "several numerical studies have been done with different numerical schemes  @xcite .",
    "most of them concentrated on the radiation - dominated phase after inflation , and very recently hiramatsu  @xcite investigated consequences of a different equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "all of the above papers consider very nave initial conditions , ignoring initial abundance of kk fluctuations .",
    "however , since the gravitational wave perturbations are of quantum - mechanical origin , the most plausible initial configuration of the perturbations during inflation should include vacuum fluctuations in kk modes .",
    "taking this point into account , in refs .",
    "@xcite kobayashi and tanaka have developed a numerical formulation using the wronskian , by which one can discuss the quantum - mechanical generation and subsequent evolution of gravitational waves .",
    "following the previous works  @xcite , in the present paper we revisit the spectrum of inflationary gravitational wave background in the braneworld , focusing in particular on the effect of initial abundance of the kk fluctuations .",

    "we will work in the randall - sundrum - type braneworld  @xcite , and the bulk metric is given by the five - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime @xmath4 where @xmath0 is the bulk curvature scale .",
    "a cosmological solution can be described by a moving brane in the above static coordinates .",
    "the scale factor @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of the location of the brane @xmath6 as @xmath7 , and it is governed by the modified friedmann equation  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the matter energy density on the brane and @xmath10 is the tension of the brane .",
    "the matter content is characterized by the equation of state parameter @xmath11 since the standard conservation law @xmath12 holds on the brane , we have @xmath13 when @xmath3 is constant . using this and eq .",
    "( [ friedmanneq ] ) we obtain the scale factor as a function of the proper time @xmath14 on the brane .",
    "the initial stage of the background model is assumed to be described by a de sitter brane with a constant expansion rate @xmath15 , and the final stage by a minkowski brane .",
    "the two stages are connected smoothly by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) brane with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we dub this phase as the `` frw phase '' .",
    "the connection to the minkowski phase is done at sufficiently low energies because we would like to focus on the possible high energy effects at the early stage of the frw phase just after inflation .",
    "the construction here allows us to discuss the quantum - mechanical generation of gravitational waves during inflation and their subsequent evolution during the frw phase , and to see the final amplitude of the well - defined zero mode . in the previous paper",
    "@xcite only the radiation - dominated stage ( @xmath16 ) was considered , but in the present paper we are interested in other various values of @xmath3 as well .",

    "we decompose it into the spatial fourier modes as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fundamental mass scale which is related to the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "the linearized einstein equations give the klein - gordon - type equation for @xmath23 : @xmath24 and the junction conditions at the brane read @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unit normal to the brane . from now on we suppress the subscript @xmath27 .    following the previous papers  @xcite we use the wronskian formulation to compute the spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "basic details of the formulation and numerical scheme are explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we make a slight improvement . since double null coordinates are convenient for numerical studies , our starting point is @xmath28 in this coordinate system , the trajectory of the brane can be specified arbitrarily by @xmath29 to simplify this boundary trajectory , we make a coordinate transformation @xmath30 and then the position of the brane is given by @xmath31 the following further coordinate transformation turns out to be useful for actual numerical calculations : @xmath32 note that by an appropriate choice of the origin of the time coordinate @xmath33 , we can always have @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the position of the brane is simply given by @xmath36 we will perform numerical computations with equal grid spacing @xmath37 in both @xmath38 and @xmath39 directions .",
    "the advantage of using these new coordinates is that it is easier to extend the computational domain far away from the brane in these coordinates than in the @xmath40 coordinates which were used in the previous studies .",
    "the step size @xmath41 in the @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) coordinate increases with increasing @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , but we will adjust @xmath37 so that the maximum of @xmath41 is not so different from the step size used in ref .",
    "thanks to this choice of @xmath37 , the @xmath46 coordinates will not cause any problems in the resolution of the numerical analysis .    now",
    "the bulk metric is written as @xmath47,\\cr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and a prime stands for a derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "the proper time @xmath14 and the scale factor @xmath49 on the brane are given respectively by @xmath50 and hence we have @xmath51 given the hubble parameter @xmath2 as a function of @xmath14 , one can integrate eqs .",

    "the necessary information that determines the amplitude of the final zero mode can be picked up by using the wronskian .",
    "our wronskian evaluated on a constant @xmath38 hypersurface is defined by @xmath56 which is independent of the choice of the hypersurface .    treating the graviton field @xmath53 as an operator , in the initial de sitter phase we expand it using the annihilation and creation operators , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and its complex conjugate @xmath61 are the mode functions in the de sitter phase ( @xmath62 for the zero mode and @xmath63 for the kk modes ) . these mode functions form a complete orthonormal basis with respect to the wronskian : @xmath64 the index @xmath65 is related to the kk mass @xmath66 as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , in the final minkowski phase we expand it as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72 are the mode functions in the minkowski phase , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively , of their corresponding modes .",
    "these mode functions also form a complete orthonormal basis with respect to the wronskian : @xmath75 the explicit form of the above mode functions is presented in appendix .    using the wronskian",
    ", we now explain how to compute the spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "we assume that initially the gravitons are in the de sitter invariant vacuum state annihilated by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 the expectation value of the squared amplitude of the zero mode in the final minkowski stage is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of created zero mode gravitons and we assumed that @xmath81 . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ cp  nf ] ) we used the commutation relation @xmath82=1 $ ] and the expression of the zero mode function  ( [ mink_zeromode ] ) .",
    "the final power spectrum is then given by @xmath83 note here that by multiplying the factor @xmath84 we obtained the squared amplitude of the metric fluctuation , rather than that of the canonically normalized field [ see the definition  ( [ fourier ] ) ] .",
    "in fact , particle production is suppressed , @xmath85 , for @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the scale factor at the end of inflation . in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the modes that exits the horizon during inflation , so that the relevant wavenumber is smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "the operator @xmath89 can be projected out by making use of the wronskian relations .",
    "noting that the wronskian is constant in time , we have @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a solution of the klein - gordon equation  ( [ kgintx ] ) whose final configuration is the zero mode function @xmath92 in the minkowski phase , and subscript @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote the quantities on the final and initial hypersurfaces , respectively .",
    "it is clear that final zero mode gravitons are created from the vacuum fluctuations both in the initial zero mode and in the kk modes : @xmath95 correspondingly , the power spectrum  ( [ def_ps ] ) can be written as a sum of the two contributions : @xmath96 where @xmath97 thus what we need to do is to solve the backward evolution of the field @xmath91 and to evaluate the wronskian on the initial hypersurface in the de sitter phase , which can be done numerically  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath98 be the primordial amplitude of gravitational waves from de sitter inflation , which is given by  @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter during inflation and the function @xmath100 is related to the normalization of the zero mode ( see appendix ) . after the end of inflation",
    "the brane universe is dominated by a perfect fluid whose equation of state parameter is @xmath3 , and the frw phase is connected to the minkowski phase when the energy scale of the universe becomes sufficiently low : @xmath101 . for the modes that reenter the horizon during the low energy regime , namely , for the long wavelength modes with @xmath102 where @xmath103 corrections to their evolution are very small , suppressed by @xmath104 and @xmath105  @xcite ;",
    "the mode mixing effect is inefficient and gravity on the brane is basically described by four - dimensional general relativity .",
    "hence , for such modes the spectrum of gravitational waves is expected to have the same spectrum as the four - dimensional one : @xmath106 with @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the wavenumber associated with the horizon scale at the end of the frw phase : @xmath109 . for the relatively short wavelength modes with @xmath110 , three non - trivial things should be considered : ( i ) the modified background expansion rate [ eq .",

    "if the gravitational waves propagating in the bulk are neglected , namely , if the effects ( ii ) and ( iii ) are neglected , one would obtain an enhanced spectrum for @xmath110 , @xmath112 with @xmath113 however , this evaluation will not be correct because of efficient mode mixing at high energies",
