    "[ intro ] the one - dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite is a system of particles which hop preferentially in one direction on a one - dimensional lattice with hard - core exclusion interaction .",
    "the asep has been studied extensively since it is one of the few models which show rich non - equilibrium behaviors and is exactly solvable @xcite . besides , the asep has applications to many interesting problems such as the hopping conductivity , growth processes and the traffic flows @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "we consider the stationary state of the asep with open boundary conditions .",
    "that is , the system is connected to particle resevoirs at boundaries .",
    "the case where particles can hop only in one direction , which we refer to as the `` totally asymmetric '' case in the sequel , was solved in @xcite .",
    "the current and the density profile were calculated exactly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the phase diagram for the current and the correlation length were identified .",
    "the system exhibits phase transitions depending on the parameters at the boundaries .",
    "recently the obtained phase diagram was discussed from the point of view of the domain wall dynamics @xcite .",
    "the partially asymmetric case with the open boundary conditions was partially solved in @xcite .",
    "the current was evaluated in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the phase diagram for the current was identified .",
    "it turned out to be the same as the one obtained by mean - field approximation @xcite or by employing a plausible assumption @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram for the correlaiton length was also obtained by assuming that the correlation length is given by the logarithm of the ratio of the largest and the second largest eigenvalue of a certain matrix which plays a similar role as a transfer matrix does in equilibrium statistical mechanical models .",
    "it was shown that the phase diagram has a richer structure than that for the totally asymmetric case .",
    "the average density profile was , however , not calculated in @xcite . in this sence",
    "the obtained phase diagram for the correlation length has remained a conjecture .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the confirmation of this phase diagram . by using the explicit formula for the poisson kernel of the @xmath0-hermite polynomials , the average density profile in the thermodynamic limit",
    "is calculated for the partially asymmetric case .",
    "it turns out that the phase diagram was correctly predicted in @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we only consider the case where hoppings of particles at the boundaries and those at the bulk part of the system are compatible .",
    "in other words , when we allow the particle input at the left boundary and the particle output at the right boundary , the hopping rate to the right is assumed to be larger than that to the left .",
    "when hoppings at the boundaries and those at bulk is imcompatible , the current becomes zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the situation seems to be similar to the closed boundary condition where particles can not enter or go out of the system @xcite .",
    "off course , when we consider the finite chain , the current remains to be positive .",
    "we remark that the asymptotic current for this case was evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the definition of the model is given in terms of the master equation .",
    "the so - called matrix product ansatz , which gives the stationary state in the form of matrix product , is also explained .",
    "some properties of the @xmath0-hermite polynomials and the relationship to the matrix product ansatz are explained in section [ q - h ] .",
    "the section [ density ] is the main section of this article .",
    "first , the one - point funciton is represented in the form of double integrals .",
    "second , the average density profile in the thermodynamic limit are summerlized whereas the evaluation of the integrals are relegated to appendices .",
    "the phase diagram for the correlation length is identified .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "the one - dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is defined as follows . during the infinitesimal time interval @xmath1 ,",
    "each particle jumps to the right nearest neighboring site with probability @xmath2 and to the left nearest neighboring site with probability @xmath3 .",
    "if the chosen site is already occupied , the particle does not move due to the exclusion rule .",
    "more than one particle can not be on the same site .",
    "each site can be either empty or occupied .",
    "the case where particles can hop only in one direction , i.e. , the case where either @xmath4 or @xmath5 is called the `` totally asymmetric '' case . the @xmath6 case is called the `` symmetric '' case whereas the case where particles hop in both directions with different rates will be referred to as the `` partially asymmetric '' case . in addition , we allow the particle input at the left end of the chain with rate @xmath7 and allow the particle output at the right end of the chain with rate @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "the length of the chain is denoted by @xmath9 . in this article",
    ", we restrict our attention to the partially asymmetric case since the totally asymmetric case and the symmetric case was already solved in @xcite and in @xcite respectively .",
    "the restrictions on the parameters are @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "more formally , the process is defined in terms of the master equation .",
    "each configuration of the system is indicated by @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 denotes the particle number at site @xmath15 .",
    "namely @xmath16 if the site @xmath15 is empty whereas @xmath17 if the site @xmath15 is occupied . let @xmath18 denote the probability that the system has the configulation @xmath19 at time @xmath20 .",
    "then the time evolution of the asep is described by the following master equation , @xmath21    \\notag    \\\\    & \\quad    +    \\beta ( 1 - 2\\tau_l ) p(\\tau_1,\\tau_2,\\ldots,\\tau_{l-1},1;t ) .",
    "\\label{mas - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for instance , the master equation for @xmath22 case reads @xmath23 one can confirm himself that the dynamics of the asep is correctly encoded in the master equation ( [ mas - eq ] ) .",
    "when time @xmath20 goes to infinity , the system is expected to reach the stationary state .",
    "the probability distribution in the stationary state will be denoted as @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , except for the normalization , the stationary state for @xmath22 case is the eigenvector of the @xmath25 matrix in the right hand side of ( [ mas - eq - l2 ] ) with the eigenvalue zero .",
    "explicitly , it reads @xmath26    in @xcite , it was shown that the probability distribution of the asep in the stationary state for general @xmath9 can be written in the form of the matrix product as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are square matrices and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are vectors satisfying following relations ,    @xmath32    here @xmath33 is an arbitrary number .",
    "if one defines the matrix @xmath34 by @xmath35 the normalization @xmath36 is given by @xmath37    here , for the case of @xmath22 , we check that the state ( [ originalmpa ] ) indeed gives the stationary state of the process by using the algebraic relations ( [ mat - cond1 ] ) and ( [ mat - cond2 ] ) . for @xmath22 , ( [ originalmpa ] )",
    "reads @xmath38 three components , @xmath39 can be calculated by simply using ( [ mat - cond2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "one computes @xmath40 first changing the order of matrices @xmath41 by ( [ mat - cond1 ] ) and then using ( [ mat - cond2 ] ) .",
    "hence we get @xmath42 one can compare this expression with ( [ stationary-2 ] ) to see that this expression indeed gives the stationary state for @xmath22 case .",
    "one also sees that the arbitrary parameter @xmath33 appears in the same way for all components , @xmath43 .",
    "changing the parameter @xmath33 only changes the normalization @xmath44 .",
    "this is true for general @xmath9 as well . in this article ,",
    "the proof that the state ( [ originalmpa ] ) gives the stationary state for general @xmath9 is not given .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we express several physical quantities in the form of matrix products .",
    "the one - point function @xmath45 is defined as the probability that the site @xmath15 is occupied . in other words",
    ", @xmath45 is the average density at site @xmath15 . the two - point function @xmath46 is defined as the probability that the sites @xmath15 and the site @xmath47 are both occupied .",
    "higher correlation functions are defined similarly . in the matrix language , they are computed by @xmath48 and so on .",
    "the current through the bond between site @xmath15 and site @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 in the steady state , the current is independent of @xmath15 and hence is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "it is given by @xmath52 once one finds a representation of these algebraic relations , by using the above formula , one can in principle calculate the physical quantities such as the particle current @xmath51 , the one - point function @xmath45 , the two - point function @xmath46 and the higher correlation functions .",
    "we note that the process has an obvious particle - hole symmetry .",
    "when we look at holes instead of particles , they tend to hop to the left with rate @xmath53 and to the right with rate @xmath54 with hard - core exclusion . in addition , they are injected at right end with rate @xmath8 and they are removed at the left end with rate @xmath7 . in other words , the process is invariant under the changes , @xmath55 due to this symmetry , it is sufficient to obtain the density for the right half of the system .",
    "the density for the left half of the system is obtained by using the above symmetry as @xmath56 where the dependence of @xmath45 on the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are eplicitly indicated .    before closing the section",
    ", we present some simulation results ( fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 ) . figure 2 shows the space - time diagrams for several choices of parameters .",
    "it is clear that the properties of the system crutially depend on the values of the boundary parameters .",
    "the differeces become more transparent when we consider the particle current or the the average density profile of the stationary state . in principle , the stationary state is achieved only in the infinite time limit .",
    "however , we see from fig .",
    "2 that the system practically goes into a stationary state after some transient time .",
    "hence if we average the density over a long time after the transient time , it would be regarded as the average density profile of the stationary state practically .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath7 is small and @xmath8 is large , the bulk density is low .",
    "it decays sharply near the right boundary .",
    "this is called the low density phase .",
    "conversely , when @xmath7 is large and @xmath8 is small , the bulk density is high .",
    "it decays sharply near the left boundary .",
    "this is called the high density phase . when @xmath57 is small , the low density region and the high density region coexist ( coexistence line ) .",
    "finally , when both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are large enough , the density takes the value @xmath58 at bulk and decays slowly near both the boundaries .",
    "this is called the maximal current phase .",
    "our main tasks in the following are to obtain the average density profiles in fig .",
    "4 exactly .",
    "[ q - h ] first we introduce some notations for later convenience .",
    "we introduce the @xmath0-number , @xmath59 and the @xmath0-shifted factorial ,    @xmath60    we also define @xmath61 for @xmath62 . since products of @xmath0-shifted factorials appear so often , we use the notations , @xmath63    next a representation of the algebraic relaiton ( [ mat - cond1 ] ) and ( [ mat - cond2 ] ) is given . if we define @xmath64 we see that these relations become    @xmath65    where we put @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 .    in this article , we take the following representation for the matrices @xmath70 and the vectors @xmath71 ,    @xmath72    the constant @xmath73 is takes as @xmath74 so that @xmath75 .",
    "it should be noticed that there exists another useful representaion of the algebraic relations ( [ mat - cond1 ] ) and ( [ mat - cond2 ] ) .",
    "it was first given in @xcite and was used to obtain the phase diagram of the correlation length in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the represetation ( [ de - qb ] ) and ( [ wv - qb ] ) is that the commutation relation of the matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 turns out to be a simple diagonal matrix .",
    "we have @xmath78 this fact will play an important role for the calculation of the average density profile in the next section .    next we list some properties of the continuous @xmath0-hermite polynomials .",
    "the proofs can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "the continuous @xmath0-hermite polynomials @xmath79 are defined by the three term recurrence relation , @xmath80 with the initial condition , @xmath81 they are explicitly given by the formula , @xmath82 the orthogonality relation reads @xmath83 the generating function is also known and is given by @xmath84 for @xmath85 . to calculate the average density profile",
    ", we also need the so - called poisson kernel , @xmath86 this formula is called @xmath0-mehler formula in the mathematics literature .    here",

    "4 , the average density is almost constant at bulk part except on the coexistence line .",
    "hence we are interested in the average bulk density and how the density decays near the boundaries .",

    "the relation ( [ ri - le ] ) enables us to know the average density profile near the left boundary . on the other hand",
