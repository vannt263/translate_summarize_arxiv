    "the laws of brownian motion crucially relies on the hypothesis that the steps for the diffusing particle are small ( with finite variance ) and uncorrelated .",
    "whenever these assumptions are violated , the standard diffusion picture breaks down and anomalous phenomena emerge @xcite .    in particular , transport processes where the step length distribution has a diverging variance have been theoretically studied in detail . among those ,",
    "one of the most interesting is the so - called lvy walks @xcite , in which particles perform independent steps @xmath1 at constant velocity , with a distribution @xmath2 following an algebraic tail @xmath3 .",
    "such a distribution is said to be heavy - tailed and it is known to have a diverging variance for @xmath4 . since transport is thereby dominated by very long steps , the mean square displacement increases faster than linearly with time , hence the name superdiffusion .    among the many possible experimental applications ,",
    "our work is motivated by the recent realization of materials termed _ lvy glasses _ , where light rays propagate through an assembly of transparent spheres embedded in a scattering medium @xcite .",
    "if the diameter of the spheres is power - law distributed , light can indeed perform anomalous diffusion .",
    "owing to their ease of fabrication and tunability , such a novel material offers an unprecedented opportunity to study anomalous transport processes in a systematic and controllable way .",
    "an important feature of the experimental samples is that the walk is correlated : light that has just crossed a large glass microsphere has a higher probability of being backscattered at the following step and thus to perform a jump of roughly the same length . while the case of uncorrelated jumps is well understood @xcite , the correlation effects , that are expected to deeply influence the diffusion properties @xcite , are still to be characterized .",
    "to this aim , quenched lvy processes have been studied on one dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , different aspects regarding the scaling properties of random - walk distributions , the relations between the dynamical exponents and the different average procedures have been discussed in a common framework @xcite .    in order to get a deeper insight on the effect of step - length correlations , a class of deterministic , one - dimensional models called _ cantor graphs _ has been introduced @xcite .",
    "random walks on these structures perform correlated long jumps induced by the underlying fractal topology . as the latter",
    "is generated by deterministic rules , diffusion properties can be studied in a simpler way than in the random case .",
    "here we extended to this deterministic topologies some of the results proved in @xcite for random structures .",
    "in particular , we introduce a geometric parameter @xmath0 which plays the same role as the exponent characterizing the step length distribution @xmath2 in random systems .",
    "three kinds of statistical averaging are introduced : ( i ) a local one , namely the average of all trajectories starting from a given initial site ( whose asymptotic behaviour being expected to be independent of the site choice ) ; ( ii ) an averaging over _ all _ possible initial sites of the graph and ( iii ) averages where _ only _ scattering sites are considered as initial conditions . in the random case ,",
    "the differences between such averaging procedures have been evidenced in @xcite .",
    "on determinisitc structures , average procedures ( i ) and ( ii ) have been discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we complete the picture studying the effect of averaging over scattering sites .",
    "we evidence that the behavior of the mean square displacement is similar to random case ; while the probability density displays a more complex structure being given by a non - trivial time - dependent superposition of step functions .",
    "we remark that , in experiments @xcite , light enters the sample with a scattering event and averages of type ( iii ) are the most physically sensible quantities to compare with .",
    "interestingly , in lvy processes the root of the mean square displacement and the characteristic length of the distributions may grow according to different power laws ; here , in particular , this strongly anomalous behavior characterizes average quantities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the directed cantor graphs and we define a simple random walk on these structures .",
    "we then discuss the relevant physical quantites and the average procedures .",
    "section 4 is devoted to discuss the scaling hypothesis and the single long jump approximation , which allows to evaluate the tails of the density distribution .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss our results evidencing differences among averaging procedures .",
    "in particular for the case ( i ) and ( ii ) we review the results presented in @xcite presenting new numerical data , while for the case of average over scattering sites , which has not been discussed so far for the deterministic structures , we provide a sketch of the derivation of the dynamical exponents within the single long jump approximation and we compare the result with numerical simulations . in general the new simulations evidence that the probability density presents different asymptotic behaviors depending on the average procedures , clearly supporting both the scaling hypothesis and the single long jump approach .",
    "moreover the asymptotic behavior of the mean square displacement have been tested for a wider range of @xmath0 s .",
    "in paper @xcite we have introduced a class of graphs , denoted as directed cantor graphs , as a one - dimensional , deterministic counterpart of the geometric structure of the lvy glass materials mentioned above @xcite .",
    "indeed , random walks on the cantor graphs display a superdiffusive lvy like motion analogous to the the one of light in such inhomogeneous glassy material .",
    "the class of graphs we will consider is defined by two parameters , denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and describing the growth of the fractal from generation @xmath7 to generation @xmath8 .",
    "in particular the fractal @xmath9 of generation @xmath8 is built connecting @xmath5 fractals of generation @xmath7 by @xmath10 unidirectional bubbles of length @xmath11 , as shown in figures [ cantor_walk_var ] and [ cantor_walk_nat ] .",
    "a simple random walk @xcite is naturally defined on these structures : undirected links connect sites in both directions while directed links have to be crossed only in the prescribed way . a site is called _ bidirectional _ if the walker placed on that site can move in both directions ( and the two possible moves are performed with probability @xmath12 ) .",
    "a site is instead called _ unidirectional _ if the walker is allowed to move only in one direction ( in this case the move is performed with probability one , i.e. ballistic motion ) .",
    "all the links have unitary length and are crossed at constant velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the number of bidirectional sites @xmath14 and unidirectional sites @xmath15 present at generation @xmath8 is given by : @xmath16 where we use the convention of counting only once the couple of sites of the bubbles at the same distance from the origin .",
    "the total number of sites at generation @xmath8 is hence @xmath17 . in the following , an important parameter for",
    "the description of the structure will be the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath19 , the graphs are called _ slim _ , as the fraction of bidirectional sites vanishes in the thermodinamic limit , i.e. @xmath20 . on the contrary , for @xmath21 graphs are called _ fat _ , since a finite fraction of bidirectional sites is present , and @xmath22 .     of the graph with @xmath23 , in the @xmath24 case.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     with @xmath25 and @xmath23.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "let @xmath26 be the probability of arriving at distance @xmath27 starting from @xmath28 in @xmath29 steps . in general",
    ", @xmath26 depends on the starting site @xmath28 . however for large enough space scales ( i.e. @xmath27 much larger than the distance between @xmath28 and an origin @xmath30 ) the asymptotic properties of @xmath26",
    "are expected to be site independent and hence to describe a property of the whole graph , i.e. @xmath31 . in particular",
    ", the asymptotic behaviour of the mean square displacement @xmath32 should be independent of @xmath28 .",
    "the integration cutoff in ( [ r2loc ] ) is provided by the fact that the walker covers at most a distance @xmath33 in a time @xmath29 ( @xmath34 in the following ) .",
    "another important quantity whose asymptotic behaviour depends only on the large scale topology of the structure is the resistivity @xmath35 i.e the number of bidirectional sites whose distance from @xmath28 is smaller than @xmath27 .    on inhomogeneous structures , average and local properties",
    "are in general different @xcite , and in structures characterized by long tails , different averaging procedures can yield different results as well @xcite .",
    "in particular , on cantor graphs one can distinguish between the average over all starting sites , i.e. : @xmath36 and the averages on processes beginning with a scattering event : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the set of the bidirectional sites belonging to graphs of generation @xmath8 .",
    "the same averaging procedures can be introduced also for different quantities .",
    "one can consider the average resistivity @xmath39 and @xmath40 and , as in ( [ r2loc ] ) , one can also define the average mean square distances @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "since the resistivity can be evaluated by simply counting the number of sites in a given generation , one obtain the following asymptotic behaviours : @xmath43    @xmath44    these results represent the deterministic analog of the expressions for the resistivity obtained in a random sample in @xcite .",
    "the most general scaling hypothesis for the probabilities @xmath45 is : @xmath46 with a convergence in probability @xmath47 the leading contribution to @xmath45 is hence @xmath48 which is significantly different from zero only for @xmath49 .",
    "the subleading term @xmath50 , with @xmath51 describes the behavior at larger distances , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "notice that , if @xmath50 does not vanish rapidly enough , it can nevertheless provide important contributions to @xmath53 .",
    "the same scaling ansatz should be valid also for the average probabilities @xmath54 and @xmath55 by introducing suitable averaged scaling length and scaling functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and suitable averaged long distance corrections @xmath58 , @xmath59 .    in @xcite it has been proved that the growth of the characteristic length can be directly related to the growth of the resistance .",
    "we define the exponent describing the growth of the correlation length as : @xmath60 so that in analogy with standard definition of random walks @xcite , we get @xmath61 . then using the scaling relations proved in @xcite we obtain @xmath62 analogous relations hold for the average quantities , in terms of the average scaling lengths . introducing the known results for the resistivity ( [ rloc],[rav ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the following behaviors for the scaling lenghts : @xmath63    @xmath64    let us now discuss the behaviour of the mean square displacements .",
    "when only lengths of order @xmath65 provide significant contributions to the integral ( [ r2loc ] ) , the standard relation @xmath66 holds and the asymptotic behaviour coincides with those given by ( [ elloc],[elav ] ) .",
    "however it is known that , in presence of long tailed distributions , anomalies with respect to this behaviour can be present . in particular",
    "it has been evidenced in @xcite that a key role is played by long jumps , leading the walker to a distance @xmath67 . in the random case",
    ", consideration of a single long jump actually accounts for the asymptotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "indeed , these processes can give rise to two different types of corrections to @xmath68 .",
    "first , they can produce a zero - measure function @xmath69 , providing a significant contribution to @xmath70 ; second , the scaling function @xmath71 can feature a long tail , breaking the proportionality between @xmath70 and @xmath72 . here",
    "we will evidence that these anomalies , originating from the single long jump , are also present in the deterministic graphs and they are deeply influenced by the averaging procedures .",
    "on the graph obtained with @xmath24 and @xmath73 . note the fast decay of the scaling function .",
    "the stepwise structure of the scaling function is due to the fractality of the graph.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    let us first consider the local properties .",
    "in this situation we can focus on processes starting from the origin @xmath30 of the graph . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath27 is much larger than the distance between @xmath28 and @xmath74 , we expect that @xmath26 should behave as @xmath45 and hence the asymptotic behaviour should be the same for any starting point .",
    "when starting from the origin , in a time @xmath29 the walker typically covers a distance @xmath75 and , in the deterministic graphs , within such distance there are no bubbles of length larger than @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , long jumps do not occur and @xmath76 .",
    "therefore @xcite @xmath77 figure [ dynscal ] reports , an example the probability density @xmath45 obtained by a montecarlo simulation .",
    "the data provide a clear evidence that the scaling function presents a fast decay confirming our hypothesis of no long jump . as explained in @xcite the fractal structure give rise to log - periodic oscillations which can be discarded considering peculiar sequence of times ( in this case @xmath78 ) , however , such oscillations do not change the general framework of the scaling hypothesis . the growth of @xmath79 is plotted in figure [ x2 ] , the continuous lines represent the expected behaviors ( [ msqloc ] ) .    .",
    "power - law fits give exponents in very good agreement with the theoretical values , in equation ( [ msqloc ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]      when averaging over all the sites , it has been evidenced @xcite that for @xmath19 the motion is always ballistic , while for @xmath21 the situation is much more complex , since the walker can perfom a single jump much larger than @xmath80 .",
    "tipically , such a long jump occurs at the first step because , with a random choice of the starting point , the probability of belonging to a large bubble is much larger at @xmath81 than during the rest of the evolution .",
    "in this situation , one can estimate the zero measure correction to @xmath54 obtaining @xmath82 , i.e. a peak associated with the ballistic motion of the particle , weighted by a factor @xmath83 representing the probability of belonging to a bubble larger than @xmath29 at the initial time .",
    "the behavior of @xmath68 is illustrated in the simulations of figure [ pscaling_73_medio ] evidencing the presence of a scaling regime for @xmath84 and of balistic peaks at large @xmath27 whose height evolves as @xmath85 ( dased line ) .",
    "even if @xmath58 provides a subleading contribution to @xmath54 , the integral in ( [ r2loc ] ) is dominated by @xmath58 for @xmath86 and by @xmath87 only when @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the behaviour of the mean square displacement is @xmath89 while the motion is purely ballistic for @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ x2_73_92 ] shows that the predicted exponents ( [ r2avg ] ) are well verified .     in the average case .",
    "the data refer to the case @xmath90 @xmath91 .",
    "ballistic peaks at @xmath92 scale as @xmath93 ( dashed line ) , while for @xmath84 the scaling hypothesis is well satisfied.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    ) in both the regimes @xmath86 and @xmath88.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in @xcite it has been shown that , for random systems , averages over bidirectional scattering sites can provide different results with respect to averages over all starting points and a scaling approach has been discussed , based on the single long jump approximation . here we introduce an analogous argument for the deterministic graph .     in the case of averages over bidirectional sites . here",
    "we plot the case @xmath94 and @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath95 the scaling hypothesis ( [ sal ] ) is very well verified with @xmath96 growing as indicate in ( [ elloc ] ) . for larger @xmath27",
    "the behaviour is much more complicated since the tails are composed by a superpositions of step functions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    ) given by the continuous lines .",
    "different values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are considered , showing that the predictions ( [ msqav ] ) are verified in the different regimes of @xmath0s.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the case of average over bidirectional sites , the single long jump does not occur necessarily at the first step .",
    "in particular for the deterministic graph the probability of performing a jump of length @xmath97 in a time @xmath29 is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of bidirectional sites visited by the walker in a time @xmath29 and @xmath100 is the probability that a bidirectional site belongs to a bubble of length @xmath101 . discarding this long jump , the distance crossed by the walker in a time @xmath29 is of order @xmath96 , and therefore , according to the behaviour of the resistivity described by equations [ rloc ] , @xmath102 for @xmath19 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "the main difference with respect to the random case is that now the only possible lengths of the long jumps are given by the sizes @xmath101 of the bubbles in the fractal .",
    "hence , for @xmath105 , @xmath55 is a complex step function where both integers @xmath6 and @xmath5 plays a non trivial role .",
    "however , the contribution to the mean square displacement can be evaluated as follows : @xmath106 where the first sum is related to the bubbles of length @xmath101 ( @xmath107 ) providing a contribution to the mean square displacements of order @xmath108 , while the second sum comes from the bubbles of length larger than @xmath29 , providing a contribution @xmath109 . expanding equation [ msqav1 ] for large times",
    "one obtains the asymptotic behaviours @xmath110 for @xmath19 and @xmath111 for @xmath21 .",
    "the first expression is always dominant with respect @xmath80 , while the second expression becomes subleading for @xmath112 .",
    "the overall behaviour of the mean square displacement is summarized as follows : @xmath113    equations ( [ msqav ] ) extend the results of the random case to the deterministic topology described by the directed cantor graphs . clearly",
    "the complex shape of the scaling function ( [ msqav1 ] ) determines the presence of logperiodic oscillations superimposed to ( [ msqav ] ) , which is a a typical behaviour of fractal structures @xcite .",
    "figure ( [ scalpmeansc ] ) evidences that the dymanical scaling is well verified for @xmath95 , while at larger distances @xmath55 is characterized by a superposition of slowly decaying step functions as predicted by ( [ msqav1 ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ r2meansc ] ) evidences by means of montecarlo simulations that equations ( [ msqav ] ) are well verified for large times in the whole range of @xmath0 s .",
