    "with the mosaic ccd imager on the 0.92 m telescope at kpno , we are able to cover an 1@xmath1 field in a single observation , and reach limiting fluxes corresponding to star formation rates ( sfrs ) of about 0.1 m@xmath2/yr for extended galaxies and @xmath30.01 m@xmath2/yr for compact emission - line galaxies",
    ". the broad goals of the survey are to construct a complete inventory of star forming galaxies in a well - defined volume limited sample , to characterize the demographics of the local star forming population , and to quantify the completeness of other methods for measuring the local sfr density .",
    "we are also carrying out a parallel survey of a local field sample , so we also will be able to study the influences of cluster environment on the sfrs .",
    "we have observed four clusters so far during an observing run in february 1999 .",
    "these clusters have been observed previously by moss , whittle , & pesce ( 1998 : mwp98 ) using an objective prism technique . in figure  1 , we show a flux distribution of h@xmath0-emitting galaxies in a1367 . also shown by shaded histograms are the distributions of the galaxies detected by mwp98 . although the analysis is still in the preliminary stage , the comparison between our data and those from mwp98 s prism survey suggests that @xmath4% of h@xmath0 flux is missing from the latter .",
    "this is due to a combination of insensitivity of the prism survey to low - luminosity emission - line galaxies and to brighter galaxies with weak extended h@xmath0 emission .",
    "in addition , we note that we have detected a large number h@xmath0-emitting galaxies without any velocity data .",
    "since membership is uncertain for these objects , we have not included them in any of the analysis .",
    "however , it is evident that the imaging survey has revealed the incompleteness in the detection of h@xmath0 fluxes in the previous prism surveys .",
    "while visually searching for emission - line galaxies in the central field of abell  1367 , we found a particularly interesting field around n3860 , cgcg  97 - 114 and cgcg  97 - 125 , scattered with emission - line dwarf knots .",
    "each `` knot '' is only a few arcsec in diameter , however , some are clustered in small groups that likely are par of dwarf galaxies . with the present data",
    ", we can not answer as to what triggered such widespread star formation in this particular region of the cluster .",
    "we have obtained spectra for some h@xmath0-emitting objects and they all coincide with those of cgcg97 - 114 and 97 - 125 ( @xmath5 km / s ) , confirming that they are associated with the larger galaxies in this group .",
    "( ngc  3860 is not in this group ; its velocity is @xmath6km / s ) .",
    "the star formation rates for these objects , calculated using kennicutt ( 1983 ) , vary from @xmath7 up to @xmath8m@xmath9/year ."
