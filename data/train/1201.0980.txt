    "at the time of this writing , agreement has yet to be reached over whether the non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) in solid @xmath0he at low temperature , first reported by kim and chan@xcite , marks the first actual observation of the long sought supersolid phase of matter .",
    "the sheer weakness of the superfluid signal , the predicted resilience of superfluidity ( sf ) in the metastable , overpressurized liquid@xcite , the ostensibly important role played by extended defects , as well as some puzzling experimental observations ( such as the concomitant occurrence of the ncri with stiffening of the crystal @xcite ) , have so far precluded a straightforward interpretation of the phenomenology in terms of any conventional framework of supersolidity .",
    "first principle numerical simulations of crystals of @xmath0he , have yielded rather strong evidence that superfluidity does not take place in a perfect crystal@xcite , and cast serious doubts on microscopic scenarios based on bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of point defects , such as vacancies or interstitials @xcite . +",
    "while there exist dissenting views@xcite , it seems fair to state that consensus is growing that the ground state of solid @xmath0he is commensurate , i.e. , free of point defects , and non - superfluid .",
    "indeed , mounting experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that , if supersolidity occurs at all in helium , its character is likely to deviate significantly from the physical picture laid out in the seminal works of andreev and lifshits@xcite , chester@xcite and leggett@xcite .",
    "in particular , extended defects such as grain boundaries@xcite or dislocations@xcite might play a significant role in the phenomenology@xcite .",
    "+ in order to make progress toward a more complete understanding of the physics of solid helium , and more generally of the supersolid phase , a useful first step seems to be the unequivocal identification of a simple physical system , whose supersolid character can be established unambiguously , by means of controlled measurements as well as reliable , first principle calculations .",
    "the investigation of such a system may shed light on yet poorly understood aspects of the supersolid phase , which could in turn help resolve the controversy over solid helium , as well as facilitate the detection of supersolid behavior in other systems .",
    "the question is , of course , which other physical system , besides helium , can be opined to feature a supersolid phase , in a region of its phase diagram accessible by current technology .",
    "+ among simple atomic or molecular condensed matter systems , helium has always been regarded as the ideal candidate to display supersolid behavior . due to the very low reactivity at ordinary conditions of temperature and pressure",
    ", helium atoms can be to an excellent approximation considered elementary particles ; for the most abundant isotope ( @xmath0he ) , these particles have spin zero , and thus obey bose statistics . on account of its low atomic mass , as well as of the weakness of the inter - atomic potential , liquid helium escapes crystallization at low temperature , under the pressure of its own vapor .",
    "solidification occurs if moderate pressure is applied , but atomic excursions away from lattice sites remain significant in the crystalline phase .",
    "+ the closest condensed matter system to helium , that may enjoy similar properties , is molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) , also an assembly of bose particles . actually , the mass of a parahydrogen molecule is half of that of a helium atom , which should lead to even greater quantum effects .",
    "however , the attractive well of the interaction between two such molecules is about three times deeper than that between two helium atoms . as a result ,",
    "liquid hydrogen crystallizes at a relatively high ( 14 k ) temperature , significantly above that at which bec and sf are expected to occur .",
    "albeit effects due to bose statistics are detectable in the momentum distribution of liquid parahydrogen near freezing@xcite , in general the behavior of condensed molecular hydrogen is much closer to that of a classical system than to helium . indeed , while some theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite evidence of superfluidity ( and even possible _",
    "supersolidity_@xcite ) in small clusters of parahydrogen ( comprising around twenty molecules ) has been reported , agreement is virtually unanimous that bulk condensed parahydrogen displays no superfluid behaviour@xcite . +",
    "as it turns out , the physics predicted for solid @xmath0he ( or , parahydrogen ) , as it emerges from first - principle quantum simulations , is essentially a direct consequence of the strong repulsive core of the interatomic potential at short distance ( less than @xmath2 2  ) .",
    "it is the repulsive core that determines most of the thermodynamic properties of helium and other quantum solids and liquids , witness the fact that a very simple model of bose hard spheres reproduces rather accurately the phase diagram of condensed helium @xcite .",
    "+ computer simulation studies of classical crystals , based on the lennard - jones potential ( also featuring a hard core ) , suggest that , much like in a highly quantal solid like helium@xcite , a uniform gas of point defects ( vacancies or interstitials ) is unstable against phase separation @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the basic physics of the crystals is dominated by the strong interaction among particles , and that quantum effects can not really alter it qualitatively ( unlike in the liquid phase ) .",
    "one is therefore naturally led to pose the following questions : can a supersolid phase of matter be underlain , in a many - body system , by a pair - wise interaction among elementary constituents featuring a  soft \" repulsive core at short distances ? and , if that is the case , do such physical systems exist in nature , or are they at least artificially realizable ?",
    "if one wishes to retain the simple picture of  elementary \" particles interacting via a static pair potential @xcite , spatially confined ultracold gases provide an alternative , in many respects more promising option to the controlled observation of the supersolid phase .",
    "it is now seventeen years since the first successful observation of bec in rubidium gas , cooled down to temperature in the nanokelvin range @xcite .",
    "impetuous scientific and technological progress has rendered the field of ultracold atoms the playground of choice , to which one can turn to address outstanding questions in condensed matter and many - body physics . + dilute assemblies of cold atoms represent almost a textbook many - body system , _ a _ ) virtually free from the imperfections and  background noise \" that often mask subtle physical effects in a sample of condensed matter , and _",
    "b _ ) affording a degree of control that no naturally occurring solid or liquid can match .",
    "last but not least , there exist a number of techniques whereby the interaction between atoms or molecules can be altered , making it virtually an adjustable parameter .",
    "the simplest example of such techniques , is the so - called _ feshbach resonance _",
    "@xcite , allowing one to vary the strength of the ( short - ranged ) interaction between two atoms or molecules , and even reverse its sign ( i.e. , turned from repulsive to attractive , or vice versa ) .",
    "but then , if novel artificial inter - particle potentials can be created , the field is wide open for the search for a specific type of interactions , or broad class thereof , for which supersolid ( or other yet unexplored ) phases may occur .      as mentioned above",
    ", the repulsive core of virtually _ any _ known interaction among atoms or molecules , is what prevents microscopic scenarios of supersolidity based on point defects from occurring , as such defects have the tendency to cluster together . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist theoretical predictions of supersolid behavior in two - dimensional systems wherein pair - wise interaction feature a slow decay at large inter - particle separations , e.g. , @xmath2 @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "+ the physical picture is radically different , in this case , from that based on bec of point defects , and it is based on the peculiar behavior of a purely repulsive dipolar system in the proximity of crystallization . in an ordinary first - order phase transition , there exists a finite range of density @xmath5 wherein no homogeneous phase is thermodynamically stable .",
    "rather , two phases of different density ( i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , coexist , separated by a macroscopic interface .",
    "it can be shown , however , that in the presence of long - ranged interactions ( such as the dipolar ) the energy associated to such an interface contains a negative term , diverging logarithmically in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . as a result",
    ", ordinary coexistence is energetically disfavoured .",
    "on approaching the transition from the low - density ( e.g. , the liquid ) phase , the system may lower its free energy by embedding sufficiently large solid domains ( i.e. , macroscopic  clusters \" ) inside the liquid . in the low temperature limit",
    ", two effects are predicted : the transition of the liquid to a superfluid , and the crystallization of solid bubbles into a lattice superstructure , resulting in a global supersolid phase ( in fact , a whole set of different such phases @xcite ) .",
    "a well - defined way of testing the above prediction in ultracold gases , makes use of atoms or molecules possessing a finite electric dipole moment .",
    "these particles can be confined to quasi two dimensions , by means of an external harmonic potential in the direction perpendicular to the motion ( the so - called  pancake \" geometry ) . upon aligning all dipoles in the direction perpendicular to the plane , by means of a strong external electric field",
    ", one can study a system of bosons interacting via a purely repulsive potential @xcite of the form @xmath8 .",
    "+ there is a subtle aspect in the derivation of the above predictions , however . for",
    ", the negative contribution to the surface tension is proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the droplet size .",
    "if the jump in density @xmath11 at the phase transition is small ( and quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite suggest that this may indeed be the case ) , the characteristic value of @xmath10 required to observe the above scenario may be exceedingly large , for practical purposes outside the reach of realistic experimental or even numerical setups .",
    "+ the remainder of this article focuses on a different class of interactions , featuring a soft - core potential at short inter - particle distance , one which does not grow arbitrarily , but plateaus to a finite value .",
    "below , we review theoretical predictions , based on first principle numerical simulations , of a system of such soft - core bosons , in two dimensions .",
    "the purpose is twofold : on the one hand , such a system can be shown to support a supersolid phase , whose physics turns out to be quite intuitive , arguably simpler than the scenarios that have been thus far considered for solid helium .",
    "secondly , because this type of interaction appears to be realizable in assemblies of cold atoms , by means of the so - called rydberg blockade , cold atoms may provide an entirely new , likely more direct pathway to the observation in the laboratory of a supersolid phase .      in order to understand how a pair - wise interaction featuring a soft repulsive core at short inter - particle separation can lead to the appearance of a supersolid phase , it is useful to elucidate first the nature of the classical crystalline phase that occurs in a system characterized by this kind of interaction .",
    "to this aim , we consider the simplest soft - core pair potential , i.e. , one that is equal to some energy @xmath12 if particles are less than a distance @xmath13 apart , zero otherwise .",
    "+ imagine lining up particles interacting via this potential in one dimension , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fm1 ] .     if the distance between two particles is less than their effective diameter @xmath13 , and zero if it is greater . as the distance between nearest neighboring particles approaches @xmath13 , arrangement shown in ( b )",

    "[ fm1](a ) , the potential energy per particle discontinuously goes from zero to @xmath14 , in correspondence to a classical crystal with lattice constant @xmath13 .",
    "however , the system can lower its energy by one half , by allowing each other particle to overlap in part with one of its neighbor ( on the left , for example ) , i.e. , effectively doubling the lattice constant of the crystal , as each unit cell contains now two particles . on increasing the density , the number of particles per unit cell increases , while the lattice constant remains unchanged .",
    "crucial to this effect , of course , is the finite energy  cost \" associated to particle overlap . +",
    "the subject of _ multiple occupation crystals _ ( or `` cluster crystals '' , as they are often referred to ) , has been extensively investigated in classical materials science , where they arise in the context of colloids and macromolecules @xcite .",
    "in particular , even though the qualitative argument offered above made use of the simple barrier potential , a quantitative criterion has been formulated , that allows one to predict the average number of particles @xmath15 in the unit cell of the cluster crystal , based on general features of the soft - core interaction@xcite .",
    "+ how does quantum mechanics alter this simple picture ?",
    "in two fundamental ways : _ a _ ) owing to quantum delocalization , particles can  hop \" to adjacent clusters , and _",
    "b _ ) an effective attraction among identical particles sets in in the case of bose statistics , as exchanges of identical particles results in a lower kinetic energy ( this is , of course , the same physics that gives rise to bose - einstein condensation ) .",
    "consider for definiteness a system of identical bose particles of mass @xmath16 , and let their interaction be described by a pair - wise potential , only depending on the relative distance of two particles , for which an effective range @xmath13 can be defined .",
    "if all distances are expressed in units of @xmath13 , and @xmath17 is the energy unit , the ( dimensionless ) many - body hamiltonian can be expressed as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance between @xmath20th and @xmath21th particles . the only requirement on @xmath22 ,",
    "is that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ( dimensionless ) mean inter - particle distance . in other words ,",
    "the energy barrier associated to the repulsive core of the interaction , should not be much greater than the characteristic kinetic energy@xcite .",
    "+ in order to render the discussion more quantitative , we now focus on the phase diagram of a specific model of soft - core bosons .",
    "we assume the simplest form of the pair potential , namely the  barrier \" one discussed above @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heaviside s function and the potential strength @xmath27 is expressed in units of @xmath28 .",
    "as it tuns out , this simple model embodies all the physics of interest that we wish to present here .",
    "we postpone therefore the discussion of more more realistic interactions , until after establishing the main physical results for the barrier potential .",
    "henceforth , we shall assume that the system is confined in two dimensions .",
    "+ the thermodynamic properties of a two - dimensional system of spin - zero bosons , interacting via a soft - disk pair potential , can be investigated by means of computer simulations , which have the advantage of being essentially _ exact _ , uncertainties being reducible in principle to arbitrary degree , given enough computer time .",
    "in particular , computer simulations based on the worm algorithm @xcite have emerged in recent years as a powerful methodology , affording both numerical accuracy as well as physical insight .",
    "it is particularly well suited to investigate bose superfluids , in that it affords the simultaneous , direct computation of the superfluid fraction , using the well - known _ winding number _ estimator of pollock and ceperley @xcite , as well as of the one - particle density matrix . +",

    "the system is an insulating droplet crystal ; thus , @xmath42 decays rapidly , falling to essentially unmeasurable values for @xmath43 , i.e. , outside the nominal inter - particle separation .",

    ", @xmath42 decays slowly at long distances , in conformity with the presence of a superfluid regime described by kosterlitz - thouless theory@xcite .",
    "concurrently , it displays marked oscillations , reflecting the underlying crystalline arrangement of the clusters .",
    "these oscillations arise microscopically from tunnelling of particles across adjacent clusters , and give rise to satellite peaks in the fourier transform of @xmath42 , namely the momentum distribution , which in cold atom assemblies lends itself to experimental imaging by means of time - of - flight measurements@xcite .",
    "thus , the supersolid character of the system could be experimentally ascertained in a rather straightforward way .",
    "the emergence of off - diagonal long - range order , coupled with the solidlike oscillations , is clearly shown by the temperature dependence of the @xmath42 , displayed in fig . [ fm4 ] .",

    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fm5 ] are consistent with a superfluid transition in the kosterlitz - thouless universality class @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the superfluid fraction does not saturate to a value of 100% in the @xmath45 limit , consistently with the prediction of leggett@xcite for a superfluid system breaking translational invariance .",
    "+ interestingly , it is possible to ascertain that , even in the insulating ( e.g. , non - superfluid ) droplet crystal phase , individual droplets are superfluid , as shown by the statistics of permutation exchange cycles@xcite .",
    "however , the transition of the system to a globally superfluid phase can only be established numerically in a well - defined range of values of @xmath27 , as tunnelling is exponentially depressed with increased @xmath27 . because the computational methodology adopted here is a _ finite - temperature _ one , we can not make a definitive prediction of a _ quantum phase transition _ at @xmath37=0 , driven by the parameter @xmath27 , between a supersolid and an insulating droplet crystal , based on the results of the simulation alone ; however , our results are certainly consistent with that conclusion . +",
    "the physical behavior of the supersolid droplet crystal phase is certainly reminiscent of that of a josephson junction array .",
    "futhermore , for a system of identical bosons , one is naturally led to think of this many - body system in tems of a lattice bose hubbard model ( bhm ) , which is known to display a superfluid ground state at low temperature@xcite .",
    "it is important to note , however , that in this case the lattice is _ self - assembled _ ,",
    "i.e. , not imposed mathematically through space discretization , or experimentally ( e.g. , by means of optical lattices ) .",
    "it is this crucial difference , that ultimately allows one to speak meaningfully of a _ supersolid _ phase in this context@xcite .",
    "the physics illustrated above would reain of merely  academic \" interest , were it not because a well - defined procedure exists to realize a soft - sphere type interaction in an assembly of ultracold atoms , by means of a procedure known as _ rydberg blockade _ ( rb ) .",
    "such a physical mechanism was initially introduced as a device to manipulate quantum information stored in collective states of mesoscopic ensembles @xcite , but it also has been recently proposed as a way to engineer a novel type of interaction potential between cold atoms . specifically , the modified interaction  flattens off \" , and remains essentially constant below some characteristic  cut - off \" distance @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "+ the soft sphere model should capture the main features of the interaction potential arising in the rb regime .",
    "however , it is necessary to assess the robustness of the main physical predictions illustrated above , by studying systems characterized by more realistic model interactions , closer to those which could be realized in practice . in particular , one need assess any possible dependence on the physics of interest on the detailed features of the potential near the cut - off distance , as well as any influence of a long - range tail of the interaction itself . +",
    "as it turns out , the main physical results , chiefly the presence of a supersolid phase , can be shown to be largely independent on details of the interaction , beyond the presence of a soft core .",
    "thus , the droplet crystal phase ought be observable under relatively broad experimental conditions .",
    "for example , in the original work in which the droplet crystal phase was first predicted@xcite , by means of computer simulations like the ones described above , it was found that the same physics takes place in a two - dimensional system of bosons interacting through the following potential : @xmath46 which also has a soft core at short distance , but a smooth behavior near the characteristic cut - off distance @xmath13 , as well as a dipole - like long - range tail .",
    "the potential ( [ pipo ] ) provides a realistic description of the specific type of interaction between pair of cold atoms that could be realized in the laboratory , via the rb @xcite .",
    "all of this constitutes  circumstantial \" evidence that the presence of a  plateau \" at sufficiently short distances , namely a range within which the potential energy of interaction is either constant or varies very slowly as two particles are brought closer together , is the crucial feature that enables the formation of the droplet crystal phase , which turns supersolid at low temperature .",
    "indeed , recent studies of two - dimensional bose systems in which particles interact via a repulsive yukawa potential show that no droplet crystal ( nor any other supersolid phases ) exist in that system@xcite .",
    "the yukawa potential has an infinitely strong repulsive core in the @xmath47 limit , which , despite its very slow growth , suffices to prevent the occurrence of the physics discussed here .",
    "indeed , the basic physics of solids made of yukawa bosons is the same as that of solid @xmath0he .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that no supersolid phase has also been thus far observed in numerical studies of purely repulsive dipolar systems in two dimensions .",
    "+ it has been recently conjectured@xcite , that a _ necessary _",
    "condition for the occurrence of a supersolid phase ( presumably of the  droplet crystal \" kind ) , may be that the fourier transform of the two - body potential go negative ( i.e. , that the potential become attractive ) in some range of @xmath48 .",
    "such a condition is _ not sufficient _ , as the purely repulsive soft - core interaction , whose fourier transform is oscillating and indeed goes negative for some values of @xmath48 , does _ not _ allow for a supersolid phase if the repulsive potential barrier is too high@xcite .",
    "+ now , obviously any realistic interaction displays a _",
    "hard _ core at sufficiently short distances , as electronic clouds of different atoms are prevented by pauli exclusion principle from spatially overlapping .",
    "therefore , the relevance of any soft - core model ultimately hinges on a substantial difference in scales between the characteristic radius of the region in which the repulsive part of the potential softens , and the ( much smaller ) radius of the hard core .",
    "because the softening of the potential at short distances is an artifical feature , arising from the rb , it seems conceivable that one may be able to tune the parameters in order to realize such a condition .",
    "+ on the other hand , the behavior of the potential at large inter - particle separation is irrelevant to the existence of the supersolid phase described above , which has been predicted in theoretical studies in which different power law decays of the long - range tail were considered@xcite .",
    "after decades of intense investigation , aimed at identifying a supersolid phase in solid helium , it now appears as if such a phase might be detected and explored more easily in a different context , namely in cold atom assemblies .",
    "besides providing the experimenter with a remarkably  clean \" and controllable many - body system , the existence of techniques capable of fashioning the desired inter - particle interactions pave the way to the observation of novel phases of matter , difficult to achieve or non - existent in ordinary condensed matter physics .",
    "+ in particular , a physical mchanism known as the rydberg blockade can give rise to pair - wise potentials between cold atoms , featuring a relatively  flat \" region at short inter - particle separations . as shown above",
    ", this spefici property can underlie a supersolid phase , consisting of a self - assembled crystal of superfluid droplets .",
    "tunnelling of particles among adjacent droplets can establish phase coeherence and give rise to a supersolid phase , whose most direct experimental signature are secondary peaks in the momentum distibution .",
    "+ computer simulations give evidence that such phase should be observable under relatively broad conditions , as it is insensitive to the detailed behavior of the inter - particle potential at long distances .",
    "the same physical behavior is also observed with different potentials featuring a flat region at short distance .",
    "hard core potentials , on the other hand , do not lead to a supersolid phase , even those whose growth at short distance is slow , like the yukawa potential .",
    "+ to our knowledge , no condensed matter system ( either experimentally known or even toy model ) has been predicted to display the supersolid phase illustrated here .",
    "the remarkable intuitiveness and simplicity of the supersolid droplet crystal phase makes it not only a promising candidate for a direct , unambiguous observation of the supersolid phenomenon , but also a potential convenient prototype supersolid , allowing one to explore aspects of this intriguing phase difficult to access experimentally in other systems , such as helium .",
    "this suggests that a system of soft - core bosons may warrant further investigations , aimed at exploring additional aspects of the supersolid phase , which could render its identification in other condensed matter systems .",
    "for instance , the study of the excitation spectrum of the supersolid phase , with particular attention to the presence of two separate modes , corresponding to the simultaneous breaking of translational and gauge symmetries , seems a worthwhile undertaking .",
    "+ also of interest would be the study of supersolid mixtures , which may display intriguing de - mixing properties , as well as the motion of impurities through a supersolid .",
