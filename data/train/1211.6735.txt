    "the charging and discharging of an ideal capacitor are ruled out by simple equations derived from the ohm law , the kirchhoff rule and the capacitance definition . the current decrease in the time _",
    "t _ of that capacitor , with capacitance _",
    "c _ , after the application of a voltage _ @xmath1 _ through a series resistance _",
    ", is described by the equation @xmath2 . during the discharge ,",
    "if we accurately measure the initial voltage , the capacitance , and the value of the applied resistor , we should be able to predict the voltage drop during the time with the same accuracy , but this is not the case for a real capacitor . the more the electrical resistance increases the more the discrepancy is magnified .",
    "it is known that a real capacitor retains more charge at the time _",
    "t _ than the theorised charge .",
    "a spectacularization of this behaviour is the resurfacing of some part of the initial charge at the electrodes if left open ( @xmath3@xmath4 @xmath5 ) after the discharge of the capacitor with a short ( @xmath3 @xmath4 0 ) .",
    "this re - emerging charge varies from about 0.01 to 10 @xmath6 of the previous applied one and depends on the kind of dielectric .",
    "the phenomenon was first described more than 150 years ago when , in 1854 , kohlrausch observed a long lasting relaxation in a leyden jar @xcite . since then",
    ", several different terms have been adopted to describe the same phenomenon : dielectric absorption , dielectric relaxation , soakage , voltage retention and so on .",
    "the nature of dielectric relaxation is not yet fully understood . to date , however , the charging current due to a voltage step application was substantially expressed by power or stretched exponential functions assuming the form of the curie - von schweidler law @xmath7 or @xmath8 $ ] where the prefactors _ a _ and _ b _ are temperature and applied voltage dependent , 0@xmath9@xmath10@xmath92 , 0@xmath9@xmath11@xmath91 ( both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are again more or less temperature dependent ) , and @xmath12 is a time constant .",
    "several studies were carried out on this subject , aimed at investigating both the physical mechanisms of the phenomenon and more practical possibilities of solving technical problems that the phenomenon involves , jeopardizing the performances of electronic devices .",
    "several physical models were suggested to describe the dielectric relaxation . in most of these ,",
    "tunneling and/or thermally activated processes play the role of the main actors : charge transition between two energetic sites , separated by a barrier @xcite ; charges ( e.g. protons ) fluctuating between double well potentials @xcite ; dipoles that respond to the applied field and mutually interacting @xcite .",
    "other modelled mechanisms deal with the space charge polarization @xcite , where the ions mobility depend on the layer blocking thickness and charges can remain attracted by their image for thin layers ( more details on these mechanisms can be found in the paper by kliem @xcite ) . from a more technical point of view , dielectric absorption ( relaxation ) can be attributed to a complex capacitance ( and impedance ) .",
    "herein , the main capacitance have to be intended as connected in parallel to a network of further capacitances with series resistances forming rc pairs with different time constants @xcite .",
    "an electrical short only discharges the main capacitor and , when it is removed , the network rc pairs recharge the capacitor .",
    "it is our opinion that the dielectric relaxation explains only a part of the complex phenomenon of the charge accumulation after the short in a capacitor , or in other words , that there is a superposition of different phenomena . in 1994 ,",
    "neagu and neagu @xcite showed dielectric behaviour of pet that diverges from the behaviour based on the curie - von schweidler law .",
    "the authors stressed that the discharge was characterized by a very slow decay or a current increase over time . in 2002 and 2007 , lambert et al .",
    "@xcite and vrublevsky et al .",
    "@xcite respectively showed that charges are embedded in @xmath13 during anodization and give a true permanent polarization of the layer . in their study ,",
    "lambert et al . also reported a comprehensive synthesis of the interpretations regarding the origin of these charges : incorporation of electrolytic ionic species during oxide formation @xcite ; hydration of the oxide @xcite ; electrons injected and trapped in the layer @xcite . in 2010 , dabramo @xcite modelled a spherical vacuum capacitor with the inner sphere coated by semiconductor material able to generate a difference of potential at the electrodes by thermo - charging action at room temperature . in 2012",
    "an experimental study @xcite carried out on industrial electrolytic capacitors with @xmath13 as dielectric showed that some samples loaded with a resistor retained an appreciable charge for more than three months .",
    "the study demonstrated the conductive nature of this current , that responds to the ohm laws , its dependence on temperature and leakage current , a characteristic related to the thickness and integrity of the dielectric layer .    when we consider some of these results we have immediately to deal with the second law of the thermodynamics .",
    "several studies have been carried out on the theoretical possibility of its violation : in a brownian quantum particle strongly interacting with a quantum thermal bath @xcite , in a superconducting loop with weak links @xcite , in modelled @xcite and experimental @xcite superconducting quantum interference devices or , more generally , regarding the different aspects of thermodynamic limits @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned references are to few to adequately represent the numerous studies on this matter during the past thirty years , and the reader can , for instance , consult the reference collection in the article by dabramo @xcite .    while the modellization and analysis of interfaces and devices that violate the second law formerlty appeared worthy of consideration by the scientific community , at present there is not widely accepted experimental confirmation of this dramatic possibility .",
    "one of the crucial obstacle is the quantum scale of the involved energies , often dominated by the noise , hence the need to transpose processes from a quantum or , in any case , a sub - picometric world to an easily measurable and comfortable classical scale .",
    "herein we consider the exotic properties of electrolytic capacitors characterized by a certain degree of @xmath13 layer dissolution due to ageing that reduces the insulating barrier and could promote tunneling phenomena of charges @xcite . based on previous observations @xcite regarding this behaviour",
    ", we report on a merely experimental application of what may be an easily repeatable embodiment which shows an apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "one of the lowest power consuming electronic oscillators was assembled and set up for the present experiment .",
    "the device is based on a monolithic quad enhancement mode n - channel mosfet , matched at the factory by using programmable cmos technology ( ald110804 , advanced linear device , inc . ) .",
    "the chip is suitable for use at very low operating voltage or very low power , in the order of nanowatt .",
    "although the quad mosfet used has a precision gate threshold voltage of + 0.40v , it can operate in a so called _ subthreshold _ region where the drain current drops , for example , to 1 na at vgate - source = -0.14v .",
    "three mosfet form a three stage rc oscillator with a feedback resistor , two resistors and a capacitor representing the network .",
    "the fourth amplifier acts as a buffer .",
    "the circuit , in its original configuration @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1:epsart ] ) , is expected ( by simulation ) to produce square - wave like oscillations at about 40 hz , if supplied with 0.14 v. the power required is 1.2 nw . in our application",
    "we used a larger capacitance ( 470 pf ) than that the suggested one ( 100 pf ) to obtain a lower oscillation frequency ( some resistor values were also slightly changed with respect to the original schematics ) . after assembling ,",
    "the circuit was tested to assess its electrical behaviour ( voltage , current and oscillation produced ) .",
    "forty - eight wet electrolytic capacitors manufactured in june 1997 with rated capacitance of 10 mf , and voltage of 10 v were selected to be a potential current generator able to supply the ultra - low power oscillator at room temperature ( 25 @xmath0c ) .",
    "it is expected that in so aged capacitors the alumina layer is naturally degraded because of the long storage time without current application that electrochemically regenerates the layer .",
    "scanning electron microscopy was used to compare the anode foil from an aged capacitor with that of an equivalent one , manufactured in december 2011 . in a previous study",
    "it was found @xcite that a single capacitor of 3.3 mf can generate a current of about 5 na with a voltage around 5 mv at the above mentioned temperature .",
    "the capacitors used in the present study are delivered by the vendor with a variable voltage depending on previous charges , storage duration and conditions , accidental short of the terminals , and on their intrinsic characteristics . with the aim of removing the residual charge ,",
    "the capacitors were conditioned before being connected to the oscillator .",
    "firstly , they were stored at 25 @xmath0c for 72 h and , then , gently discharged by loading the capacitors with a resistor of 991 @xmath14 for 30 s followed by a resistor of 9.91 @xmath14 for a further 30 s. during this operation , carried out by an automatic temporized device , the discharge curve was logged and used to measure the voltage before test ( bvt ) and calculate the dc capacitance ( dcc ) .",
    "other main electrical characteristics , such as the ac capacitance ( acc ) at 120 hz , the leakage current ( lc ) , the dissipation factor ( @xmath15 ) , and the equivalent series resistance ( esr ) , were measured to characterize the capacitors .",
    "so as not to inject additional charge in the capacitors , these last measurements were conducted on a sample from the same batch of capacitors .",
    "after the discharge by resistors , the terminals were finally shorted ( r@xmath40 ) and the capacitors stored for 48 h ; the short was then removed and the capacitors were stored again for the time necessary to regain a useful charge .",
    "all the storage operations were conducted in a pid controlled thermostatic chamber expected to maintain the temperature within 25 @xmath160.1 @xmath0c , and by placing the capacitors in a grounded metallic container .",
    "although the temperature has been proven to have a high influence on the conduction current @xcite , no temperature variations were imposed in the present experiment , because the equilibrium of such high capacitance could require very long time periods .",
    "two further capacitors from the same batch , previously submitted to the above mentioned conditioning procedure , were selected to monitor the voltage increase over time . for this purpose",
    "an automatic measurement apparatus was assembled and subsequently used for the supply oscillator main test .",
    "based on the data from these two capacitors , the storage was prolonged until the voltage at the terminals left open of the 48 capacitors was expected to be at least 80 mv .",
    "three branches of 16 capacitors in parallel were subsequently formed by choosing the single capacitors in a way that each branch has similar resulting total voltage and standard deviation .",
