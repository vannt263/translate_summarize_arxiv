    "in recent years , scattered light imaging at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths has revealed intriguing spiral - arm - like features in many protoplanetary disks , such as ab aur @xcite , mwc  758 @xcite , sao 206462 @xcite , hd 142527 @xcite , hd 100453 @xcite , hd 100546 @xcite , ak sco @xcite , lkh@xmath6 330 @xcite , and v1247 orionis @xcite .",
    "the leading hypothesis for the origin of spiral arms is that they are excited by planets embedded in disks .",
    "alternative explanations , such as gravitational instability(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radially bend shadows caused with finite photon travel time @xcite , have been investigated , but may not explain the observed arms so far .",
    "making quantitative predictions on the properties of the arm - driving planets is crucial to the study of planet formation .",
    "because these planets are still located in their formation environment , their masses , orbits , and ages provide immediate constraints on planet formation models . the first attempt in this direction",
    "was made for sao 206462 by @xcite , in which the linear theory of planet - induced density waves ( equation 44 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was applied to fit the shape of the two observed arms to derive possible locations of two arm - driving planets .",
    "this linear theory fitting scheme was subsequently adopted in many other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , explaining observed spiral arms with linear wave theory is questionable due to the following three problems",
    ".    1 .   in the linear theory ,",
    "one planet only excites one continuous spiral density wave ( an inner part + an outer part , e.g. , fig . 4 in @xcite ) . in several cases a pair of nearly symmetric arms",
    "are present ( e.g. , mwc 758 , sao 206462 , lkh@xmath6 330 ) , demanding two planets at symmetric locations , which triggers dynamical stability issues .",
    "2 .   in the linear theory ,",
    "once waves are exited by planets at lindblad resonance locations , they propagate as sound waves .",
    "therefore , their openness ( i.e. , pitch angles ) increases with an increasing ratio of sound speed @xmath10 to the local keplerian speed , or equivalently disk aspect ratio @xmath2 .",
    "many observed spiral arms are wide open , demanding unreasonably high disk temperature in order to fit them with the linear theory ( e.g. , mwc758 , * ? ? ?",
    "* requiring @xmath11 ) .",
    "3 .   the linear wave theory only applies to low mass companion ",
    "planets with masses @xmath1 much lower than the disk thermal mass @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of the central star .",
    "once @xmath1 approaches @xmath12 , nonlinear effects kick in and the linear theory breaks down @xcite . in the linear wave regime",
    ", the amplitude of the wave is required to be much lower than unity , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are perturbed and unperturbed ( initial ) surface density , respectively .",
    "the detectability of such weak waves was put into question by @xcite .    recently",
    ", numerical simulations of disks with a single massive companion ( @xmath18 , @xmath19jupiter mass or above ) have shown that multiple arms can be excited by one such companion @xcite .",
    "the excitation and propagation of these arms are fully nonlinear , and they are well detectable in nir imaging , with morphologies closely resembling the observed ones . the proof of concept of this giant - companion - multiple - arm scenario was provided by hd 100453 , in which the double - arm - driving companion is detected @xcite .",
    "additionally , these arms have been shown to have significantly larger pitch angles at a given @xmath2 than the linear theory prediction , resolving the above problem # 2 .",
    "the contrast of planet - induced density waves in surface density has been well studied both ( semi-)analytically and numerically .",
    "@xcite showed that in the linear regime ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the peak surface density on the wave at each radius , and @xmath23 is the radial distance from the planet s orbit .",
    "this result has been verified using sharing box simulations by @xcite , and using global simulations by @xcite . in the nonlinear regime ( @xmath18 ) , @xcite have shown that the contrast of the wave ( @xmath24 ) reaches order unity .",
    "quantitative connections between the arm morphology to the planet mass , a key quantity to planet formation theory but very hard to measure , was first made by @xcite , who linked the symmetry of arms excited by one planet to the planet s mass .",
    "what remains unknown is how the arm contrast ( or strength ) in scattered light , a direct observable , depends on the mass of an arm - driving planet . in general , the visibility of waves in scattered light is determined by the location and curvature of the disk surface at the waves locations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are subsequently determined by both the wave amplitude in surface density , and the distribution of material in the vertical direction .",
    "the latter is determined by balancing gravity , gas pressure , and vertical kinematic support .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out 3d global numerical hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations ( section  [ sec : setup ] ) to study the contrast of the arms as functions of planet mass and disk scale height ( section  [ sec : results ] ) ; based on which , we explore what kind of planets can drive visible arms , and comment on existing observed spiral arm systems ( section  [ sec : discussions ] ) . in particular , we ask one specific question : is it possible to explain the observed arms with low mass planets each responsible for one arm as describable by the linear theory ( section  [ sec : minimum ] ) ?",
    "this general topic has been previously touched by @xcite and @xcite , who found planets of tens of earth mass are not able to drive detectable density waves . however , in both works the hydro calculations were done in 2d .",
    "@xcite have shown that the vertical kinematics of the waves can significantly enhance their visibility in scattered light , thus 3d hydro simulations are needed .",
    "we further extend the @xcite results to low mass planet regime ( section  [ sec:2d3d ] ) .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the prospects of spiral arm imaging with next generation telescopes in section  [ sec : tmt ] , before we summarize the main take aways in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the 3d lagrangian - remap hydro code ` penguin ` @xcite to perform our hydro simulations in spherical coordinates .",
    "we denote @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 as the usual radial , azimuthal , and polar coordinates .",

    "we adopt a locally isothermal equation of state , such that @xmath38 , where @xmath10 is the local sound speed of the gas . in the frame of the star , and for a planet on a fixed , circular orbit , @xmath37 is : @xmath39 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the gravitational constant , @xmath41 the stellar mass , @xmath42 the smoothing length of the planet s potential , and @xmath43 denotes the azimuthal separation from the companion .",

    "we fix @xmath44 and vary @xmath1 .",
    "we choose @xmath42 to be @xmath45 of the planet s hill radius : @xmath46 .",
    "the planet is introduced into the simulation gradually over the first orbit .",

    "the sound speed profile reads : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the sound speed at the planet s radial position .",
    "the disk aspect ratio @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the keplerian speed .",
    "this choice of sound speed profile produces a flaring disk , since @xmath55 is increasing with @xmath28 .",
    "combining with equation [ eqn : rho_radial ] , we have a surface density profile that goes as : @xmath56 . because @xmath2 determines the thermal mass @xmath12 of the disk , we perform two sets of simulations using @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , evaluated at the planet s location , to investigate its effects .",
    "radiative transfer calculations show that in an externally irradiated disk around a typical herbig ae / be star with a stellar mass 2.5  @xmath61 , a stellar radius 2  @xmath62 , and a photosphere temperature @xmath63  k , the midplane temperature @xmath64 is about 65  k at 30  au , corresponding to @xmath65 ; while in a disk around a typical t tauri star with 0.5  @xmath61 , 2  @xmath62 , and @xmath66  k , @xmath64 is about 30  k and @xmath67 .",
    "the initial velocity field assumes hydrostatic equilibrium , and has zero radial and polar velocities .",
    "the orbital frequency @xmath68 is therefore : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the keplerian frequency .",
    "our simulation domain spans 0.3 to 2.0 @xmath71 in the radial direction , the full @xmath72 in azimuth , and from @xmath73 to @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) in the polar direction when @xmath76 , where @xmath73 is the disk midplane .",
    "this top polar boundary corresponds to 7 scale heights above the midplane at the planet s location , and is about twice as high as the disk scattering surface in our radiative transfer simulations ( section  [ sec : mcrt ] ) .",
    "the dimensions of our simulation grid is @xmath77 , where the radial cell sizes are logarithmic , and the azimuthal and polar cell sizes are uniform .",
    "both the inner and outer radial boundaries are fixed at their initial values . for the polar boundaries , we enforce symmetry at the midplane since we only simulate the upper half of the disk , and use a reflecting condition at the top to prevent mass from entering or leaving the simulation domain .",
    "it takes only a few orbits for the spirals waves to be fully established , since the sound crossing time is only about 3 ( 1.5 ) orbits when @xmath78 . with similar setups , in @xcite we simulated the spiral arms up to 100 orbits , and found the arm morphology and contrast change little between 10 and 100 orbits . in this paper",
    "we simulate all models up to 30 orbits . our main results",
    "( e.g. , the correlations in figure  [ fig : contrast_raw ] ) do not change between 10 orbits and 30 orbits . to minimize the effects of gap opening and",
    "emphasize the arms , we present results at 10 orbits . for massive planets ,",
    "gaps reach a substantial depth after tens of orbits but can only be fully opened over a much longer period than the timescale considered here .",
    "this may weaken the contrast of the arms , as part of the arms closer to the planet may be truncated , which only strengthens our conclusions about the minimum detectable planet masses ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_contrast ] shows the surface density perturbation in the arms at @xmath79  au for both @xmath2 series , where @xmath22 is the peak surface density and @xmath80 is the azimuthally averaged surface density . as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] ( eqn  [ eq : sigma_contrast ] ) , for @xmath81 , density perturbation ( @xmath82 ) is roughly proportional to planet mass , while for @xmath18 density perturbation saturate at order unit .",
    "the 3d hydro density grid is subsequently read into the @xcite 3d monte carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) code to produce synthetic polarized intensity ( pi ) images at @xmath83-band .",
    "this procedure is the same as in @xcite . for the central source",
    "we assume a @xmath84k and @xmath85 star , appropriate for a @xmath86 star at 1 myr @xcite .",
    "we scale the hydro grid so that the planet is at @xmath87 au ( thus the outer disk boundary is at 60 au ) . given the inner working angle in the latest scattered light observations by sphere and gpi ( @xmath88 or 14 au at 140 pc , the distance to taurus ) , this is about the closest that a planet can be and still make the inner arms observable .",
    "we note that where the planet is does not affect the relative contrast of the planet induced features in full resolution images ; its radial location only matters when convolving the images under a given angular resolution . in the radial direction @xmath25 ,",
    "the mcrt grid starts from the dust sublimation radius @xmath89 , where the disk temperature reaches 1600 k. the 3d mcrt grid is identical to the hydro grid , except in the inner region inside the hydro inner boundary , where we use the same hydro polar and azimuthal gridding , and logarithmic gridding in the radial direction with 50 grid points .",
    "3d hydro simulations produce gas volume density , while scattered light is determined by the distribution of small dust , generally sub - micron in size .",
    "such dust is dynamically well coupled with the gas , therefore we linearly scale the gas density @xmath90 to obtain dust density @xmath91 . between @xmath89 and the hydro inner boundary ( 9 au ) ,",
    "we assume an axisymmetric inner disk smoothly joining the outer hydro disk with @xmath92 .",
    "we assume interstellar medium ( ism ) dust @xcite for these nir scattering small dust , which have a power law size distribution @xmath93 between @xmath94 .",
    "grain growth in disks can convert smaller dust into bigger particles .",
    "if the maximum dust size grows to 1 mm , our assumed small dust population would account for @xmath192% of the total dust mass .",
    "their scattering properties are calculated using the mie theory .",
    "the total dust disk mass within 60 au is scaled to @xmath95",
    ". if the gas - to - dust - mass ratio is 100:1 and all the dust are in these small sub-@xmath96-sized dust .",
    "if dust have grown to a maximum size of 1 mm while maintaining the same power law size distribution and gas - to - dust - mass ratio , the corresponding total gas disk mass would be @xmath97 . ]",
    "we note that the specific ways of filling up the inner disk ( as long as it is axisymmetric and not casting a shadow ) , the detailed assumptions on the properties of the small grains , as well as the assumed dust mass @xmath98 one order of magnitude do not affect the relative contrast of the arms at face - on viewing angle ( dust scattering angle is @xmath99 everywhere ) .",
    "mcrt simulations produce raw images at `` full resolution '' , only limited by the finite pixel size . to compare with real data , we convolve these images by a gaussian point spread function ( psf ) to achieve an angular resolution of @xmath100 assuming the objects are at 140 pc , comparable with what sphere and gpi are doing at nir wavelengths .",
    "all images are produced using 4 billion photon packets , and all will be shown in linear stretch .",
    "we simulate in total 12 models with planet masses varied between 1 neptune mass and 3 jupiter masses , and @xmath2 at the planet s location of either @xmath101 or @xmath102 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "ten models are inviscid and two are viscous . to refer to these models , we denote @xmath103 ( `` mn '' ) as neptune mass , @xmath104 ( `` ms '' ) as saturn mass , @xmath105 ( `` mj '' ) as jupiter mass , and `` h5 '' and `` h10 '' as the @xmath57 and @xmath102 models respectively .",

    "we reserve the gray color scheme for surface density maps and red color scheme for polarized @xmath83-band images in all cases .",
    "* figures 18 & 19 ) showed that the non - linear spiral shocks excited by a massive companion ( @xmath110 ) in 3d hydro simulations are significantly different in scattered light images when compared to spirals shocks in 2d simulations with an assumed vertical hydrostatic density profile ( i.e. puffing up a 2d disk ) .",
    "here we show that the same is true in the linear / weakly - nonlinear regime ( @xmath111 ) as well .",
    "figure  [ fig:2d3d ] compares the image synthesized directly from a true 3d hydro simulation , and the image synthesized from puffing up a 2d hydro surface density map , for the 1ms - h10 model ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "clearly , the inner spiral arms are more prominent in the former .",
    "this is because 3d hydro simulations produce significantly different density structures in the vertical direction in the inner waves comparing with the vertical hydrostatic solution achieved in the background disk ( equation [ eqn : rho_vertical ] ) , due to the vertical kinematic support in the waves .",
    "this is consistent with previous 3d hydro simulations showing significant vertical motion in planet - perturbed disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in the bottom panel , at the inner arms 3d hydro density decreases slower with increasing distance from the midplane ; in other words , material is `` pushed '' up to raise the disk surface ; therefore the waves receive more starlight , and become more prominent . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer spiral arms are less prominent in the 3d than in the 2d simulation , suggesting a  suppression \" of vertical density structure . in the 3d simulation",
    "the outer arms are very weak , making them unlikely to be detectable .",
    "more detailed analysis of the kinematic support is deferred to a forthcoming paper .",
    "combining with the results in @xcite , the presence of vertical kinematic support necessitates 3d hydro simulations in studies of observational signatures of planet - driven spiral arms for all planet masses , including both the linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "multiple inner arms driven by a single companion have been robustly seen in the regime of @xmath18 . in this section",
    "we show that they can also be present in the weakly nonlinear regime where @xmath113 .",

    "a tertiary arm excited by a massive companion has been seen by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here it is clearly present in the @xmath121 and @xmath122 models . while both the primary and secondary arms in images become brighter with increasing @xmath1 , the strength of the tertiary varies . at @xmath121 , although it is only marginal in the surface density map , the tertiary achieves about the same strength as the primary and secondary in scattered light ; at @xmath122 , it is more recognizable in the surface density , but much weaker than the primary and secondary in scattered light .",
    "this variation is likely caused by varying kinematic support , poorly understood at the moment .",
    "additional features , which may be considered as a @xmath123 ( and more ) arm , can also be found in the @xmath117 and @xmath119 models .      in this section ,",
    "we study the contrast of the arms as functions of location , planet mass , and disk aspect ratio .",
    "we note that because we do not include viscosity , the wave amplitudes in our simulations are not affected by dissipation ( except from shocks ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : contrast_raw ] shows the global maximum of @xmath128 for the inner arms , denoted @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath1 for full resolution images .",
    "because waves are excited at lindblad resonances close to the planet and damp through shock dissipation at large distances , the peak contrast is expected to occur at some finite distance away from the planet s orbit .",

    "it does not directly reflect the physical role @xmath2 plays , and should not be over - interpreted in that sense . as @xmath143 is always a positive number , equation  [ eq : contrast ] does not apply to @xmath144 ( i.e. , very weak waves ) , although , our data points do show that it can go very close to this limit .",
    "the scaling relation [ eq : contrast ] appears robust , spanning more than two orders of magnitudes in scaled mass in our models .",
    "since the arm constrast in scattered light depends on a variety of factors in a complicated way , this tight correlation is remarkable .",
    "we note that the quantity inside the parenthesis in equation  [ eq : contrast ] is close to @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the total torque on one side of the disk exerted by the planet in the linear regime : @xmath147 thus , the scaling in equation  [ eq : contrast ] can also be described as @xmath148 .",
    "surprisingly , the scaling holds very well across @xmath149 , suggesting linearity may not be an important factor in arm contrast .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : contrast_conv ] shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 for the convolved images ( each radial profile in figure  [ fig : radial_max ] contributes a data point ) .",
    "@xmath0 falls from its value in the full resolution images ( figure  [ fig : contrast_raw ] ) , as psf convolution smears out spiral arms .",
    "it is possible to fit a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the convolved images , although the scaling is affected by the angular resolution , location of the planet , and distance to the source , so it generally requires a case by case treatment in real observations .",
    "in this paper we focus on near - face - on systems .",
    "inclined disks are more complicated for two reasons .",
    "first , the shape and strength of an arm can be dramatically affected by the disk inclination and the arm s position angle @xcite .",
    "second , a global `` azimuthally averaged '' surface brightness does not exist , as the surface brightness at a given deprojected radius varies with azimuthal angle even without any planet , mainly due to the variation in scattering angle .",
    "in general this effect is difficult to correct , due to unknown dust properties .",
    "therefore , equation  [ eq : contrast_r ] becomes illy defined , and one can only define local feature contrast by comparing features with their immediate surrounding .",
    "the azimuthal variation of surface brightness caused by inclination in disks with no planets provides an estimate of the minimum mass of planets that can drive distinguishable arms in inclined systems .",
    "if the inclination - induced variation matches or exceeds the brightness of the spirals , they will be difficult to detect .",
    "as an example , for our assumed dust properties ( ism dust ) , planet location , and angular resolution , the two horizontal dotted lines in figure  [ fig : contrast_conv ] mark the azimuthal variation caused by an inclination @xmath150 at a projected distance @xmath126 . in the @xmath57 series , this value is lower than the azimuthal variation caused by a @xmath116 planet at face - on angle , while in the @xmath59 series it is lower than the azimuthal variation caused by a @xmath118 planet .",
    "thus , arms driven by planets with @xmath151 may be difficult to detect in our disks at 40@xmath152 inclination .      in disks , viscous diffusion tends to smear sharp features such as density waves , therefore we expect arm contrast to drop as viscosity increases . in this section",
    "we quantify this effect using simulations with finite viscosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : viscosity ] compares the surface density and scattered light images of three models with @xmath153 , @xmath59 , and different viscosities ( @xmath47 , @xmath106 , and @xmath154 ) . in full resolution images , the peaks of the primary and secondary arms drop by less than 10% as @xmath6 increases from 0 to @xmath155 , while the additional arms become significantly weaker in both surface density and in scattered light .",
    "the location of the arms are not affected by viscosity .",
    "this can be more clearly seen in the azimuthal profiles of the arms ( figure  [ fig : viscosity_azimuthal ] ) .",
    "since the global arm contrast is mainly set by the primary / secondary arm , @xmath0 drops only weakly with increasing @xmath6 for @xmath156 : in full resolution images @xmath157 , 2.05 , and 1.84 for @xmath47 , @xmath107 , and @xmath155 , while in convolved images @xmath158 , 1.26 , and 1.26 for @xmath47 , @xmath107 , and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "although viscosity in protoplanetary disks has been difficult to constrain , recent advances in both theory and observation have hinted that many disks may have low viscosity with @xmath159 :    1 .",
    "alma observations have found that the mm continuum emission in a few transitional disks is lopsided , with most of the emission coming from an azimuthally confined region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "at the moment the most promising explanation for these disks is that the emission is from a vortex formed at the edge of a gap opened by a massive planet , generated by the rossby wave instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but also see @xcite ) . to realize this scenario , a key ingredient is a low viscosity",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath159 is required to form vortices at the gap edge .",
    "non - detections of non - thermal motions induced by disk turbulence in alma gas kinematics observations of a few systems suggest low viscosity .",
    "for example , based on alma co observations , @xcite determined the level of turbulence in hd  163296 is less than @xmath160 of the local sound speed , implying @xmath161 .",
    "the prime candidate for providing viscosity in disks is the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "the operation of mri requires the disk to be sufficiently ionized and well coupled to the magnetic field , otherwise mri can not be triggered and low viscosity is expected @xcite .",
    "recently magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations have shown than non - ideal mhd effects , in particular ambipolar diffusion , can significantly suppress mri in disks at tens of au , resulting in very low viscosity equivalent to @xmath161 at the bulk of the disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , in real disks the likely low level of viscosity ( @xmath159 ) will not affect the morphology and contrast of planet - induced arms .      in observations ,",
    "whether a feature is significantly detected or not is determined by its signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . in practice , the noise level in direct imaging of disks at low to mid inclinations can be estimated as the standard deviation of the polar coordinate stokes parameter @xmath162 @xcite , where @xmath26 is the position angle ( see @xcite for an example ) . for a given observation , the noise level in physical unit ( e.g. , mjy arcsec@xmath163 ) in a specific region depends on a variety of factors , including the instrument , the data reduction procedure , the total integration time , the brightness of the star , radial distance , and observing conditions . with today",
    "s nir capability the noise level can often get down to @xmath164  mjy arcsec@xmath163 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assessing the detectable planet mass limit generally requires a case by case effort .",
    "here we provide an example to show how this can be done . if we specify a @xmath165 detection threshold as 1 mjy arcsec@xmath163 at the location of our inner arms , figure  [ fig : azimuthal_conv ] shows that in convolved images , spiral arms driven by saturn mass planets in our models are marginally detectable ( convolved images of the 1ms - h5 model can be found in figure  [ fig : image_tmt ] ) .",
    "these detection thresholds are affected by several factors . a finer angular resolution ( or smaller source distance )",
    "improves the detection threshold by bringing the arm contrast in convolved images closer to in full resolution images .",
    "a brighter star on the other hand raises both the disk surface brightness and the noise level ; whether that improves or deteriorates s / n depends on the scaling . for planets at larger radii ,",
    "a smaller physical resolution under the same angular resolution makes the arms sharper ( higher contrast ) , but their intrinsic surface brightness drops due to larger distance from the star .",
    "case - by - case modeling is needed to derive the minimum detectable planet mass with different distance , angular resolution , disk @xmath2 , planet location , and stellar luminosity .      to date",
    ", a number of systems have been identified to have spiral arms in scattered light .",
    "two distinct classes exist :    a.   mwc  758 , sao  206462 , hd  100453 , and lkh@xmath6  330 , which show large scale arms in pairs with @xmath5 , azimuthal extension @xmath166 , and a near @xmath167 rotational symmetry .",
    "b.   hd 142527 and ab aur , which show half a dozen or more small scale arms with @xmath168 , azimuthal extension @xmath169 , and no obvious rotational symmetry .",
    "the exceptions are hd 100546 , which shows very complicated structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the two main arms possibly being part of a disk ring viewed at modest inclination as in ak sco , and v1247 , which shows only one but high contrast arm @xcite .    for both classes ,",
    "it is very unlikely that each arm originates from a different planet ; instead , the number of arms is likely larger than the number of arm - driving planets .",
    "our simulations show that even a 3 neptune mass planet in a hot disk ( @xmath59 ; left panel in figure  [ fig:3mn1mj3mj ] ) and a 1 neptune mass planet in a cold disk ( @xmath57 ; top row in figure  [ fig : image_tmt ] ) drive multiple arms . moreover , these arms are weak , with @xmath170 in full resolution images ( figure  [ fig : contrast_raw ] )",
    ". when convolved by psfs and with observational noises added , these arms will likely be either undetectable , or comparable to the weakest detected arms so far ( e.g. , ab aur ) . for a single planet to drive only one arm , the planet mass has to be lower than 1 - 3 neptune masses , and such arms are very unlikely to be detectable with current nir capability .",
    "based the @xcite study of the symmetry of the arms driven by one companion , the pairs of arms in class ( a ) are likely produced by a single massive perturber on the order of 10 @xmath105 or more outside the arms , while the arm - exciting planets in class ( b ) are likely to be on the order of jupiter mass .",
    "note that in the former cases , the predicted external perturbers would carve out detectable gaps around their orbits ( and if given a sufficiently long time the planets in class ( b ) systems may do so as well ) .",
    "furthermore , class ( a ) arms can not be fit with the linear density wave theory , as has often been assumed in the literature .",
    "figure  [ fig : contrast_raw ] shows that even in the limit of full resolution images ( i.e. maximum contrast ) , to reach @xmath171 , the planet mass still has to be @xmath149 in a hot disk ( @xmath59 ) , and several @xmath12 in a cold disk ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that with @xmath18 , planet - induced spiral arms are in the fully nonlinear regime and have larger pitch angle than predicted by the linear theory .",
    "lastly , we note that the arm directly imaged in the v1247 orionis system @xcite has an astonishingly high contrast ; @xmath0 at the project distance of the arm is at least a factor of @xmath172 .",
    "although this disk has a non - negligible inclination @xmath173 , our results still suggest that the perturber in this case is likely to be massive ( several jupiter mass or above ) .",
    "at least two arms are expected , while the second arm may be under the hiciao mask , because in inclined systems the arms excited by a single companion can be at quite different radial distances due to viewing angle effects @xcite .      as an application of our modeling results ,",
    "we examine the arms in the sao 206462 disk ( central star mass 1.7 @xmath4 ; distance 140 pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inclination of the system , @xmath174 constrained by mm observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is among the lowest in all spiral arm disks .",
    "the system is close enough to being face - on so that approximately our model results at @xmath175 apply . by modeling the sed and the mm dust continuum emission of the system , @xcite determined @xmath176 at 100 au in the disk with a flaring index of 0.15 .",
    "@xcite predicted that a planet , sao 206462 b , outside the two arms at @xmath177 au from the center , can explain the general morphology of the pair of arms .",
    "thus , by rescaling our @xmath59 models to put the planet at 100 au , we can constrain the mass of sao 206462 b based on its arm contrast .",
    "note that our models are more flared ( flaring index 0.25 ) than the @xcite fitting outcome .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect the arm contrast to be significantly different .",
    "figure  [ fig : sao ] shows the results .",
    "we measure @xmath128 in the vlt / naco @xmath178-band dataset @xcite based on equation  [ eq : contrast_r ] . for a planet at 100 au , @xmath128 is expected to peak around 6070 au . in reality , @xmath128 in sao 206462 stays within 1.82 in between 5372 au , before dropping toward smaller radius ( beyond @xmath179 au the disk is too faint to perform a robust @xmath128 measurement ) .",
    "we rescale our @xmath59 models to have @xmath71=100 au , and convolve the full resolution images to reach an angular resolution of @xmath180 to match the observation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath181 curve is shown on the right panel . comparing sao 206462 s arm contrast with models suggests @xmath182 , or @xmath183 given @xmath184 .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the estimate @xmath185 made by @xcite , based on the relation between the planet mass and the azimuthal separation of the two arms .",
    "several thirty meter class telescopes ( tmct for short ) are planned , such as the thirty meter telescope , the european extremely large telescope , and the giant magellan telescope . although it is still too early to know the science definitions of the imaging instruments that will be commissioned on these telescopes , one thing for certain is that they will greatly improve the angular resolution in direct imaging , governed by the @xmath186 law .",
    "a factor of 3 to 4 improvement the over current level achieved by gpi and sphere will dramatically push down the detectable mass limit of arm - driving planets .",
    "figure  [ fig : image_tmt ] compares synthetic images of arms driven by a neptune and a saturn mass planet at 30 au convolved by the currently available @xmath100 psf and a @xmath187 psf achievable by tmct .",
    "clearly , with @xmath100 psf the arms driven by a saturn mass planet are only marginally recognizable out to a distance of 140 pc , while the arms driven by a neptune planet are hopelessly too faint , but with the @xmath187 psf , even a neptune in a solar - nebular ( @xmath87 au ; @xmath188 ) drive clearly visible arms .",
    "using 3d hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations , we quantitatively examine the morphology and contrasts of planet - induced arms in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the range of planet mass in our models spans more than one order of magnitude above and blow the disk thermal mass .",
    "our main conclusions are ( the quotes on planet masses below assumes a @xmath86 central star ) :    1 .",
    "a numerical fitting function is obtained for the maximum arm - to - disk brightness contrast @xmath0 as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( equation  [ eq : contrast ] ) .",
    "the empirical relation suggests the arm contrast is a shallow power law of the planetary torque @xmath189 .",
    "2 .   with an angular resolution of @xmath100 and at 140 pc , the minimum mass of a planet at 30 au that drives detectable spiral arms in a disk around a 1 myr 1 @xmath4 star at face - on view is about saturn mass ( section  [ sec : minimum ] ) . with a factor of 4 improvement in angular resolution enabled by a thirty meter class telescope , the detection threshold may be pushed down to at least neptune mass ( section  [ sec : tmt ] ) .",

    "mwc  758 , sao  206462 , hd  100453 , lkh@xmath6  330 , hd 142527 , and ab aur ) , it is very unlikely that each arm originates from a different planet , because the planets that only drive one arm must be below several neptune masses , and their spirals arms are most likely not dectectable ( section [ sec : minimum ] ) .",
    "4 .   similarly",
    ", the prominent arms observed in mwc  758 , sao  206462 , and lkh@xmath6  330 can not be fit with the linear theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 44 ) , as commonly assumed , because the high contrasts of these arms ( as well as their symmetry ; @xcite ) suggest that the perturbers must have @xmath190 ( figure [ fig : contrast_raw ] ) , thus the wave excitation and propagation are in the fully nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "the contrast of the arms in the sao 206462 disk suggests that the perturber sao 206462 b at @xmath8 au is about @xmath9 in mass .",
    "this is consistent with the previous @xcite estimate based on arm morphology ( section  [ sec : sao ] ) .",
    "the contrast of the outer arms is lower than the inner arms except when @xmath191a few@xmath192 ( figure  [ fig : radial_max ] ) , consistent with what was found by @xcite .",
    "combining with the fact that the outer disk is intrinsically fainter , observed arms so far are most likely to be inward of the planet s orbit .",
    "we predict that at least one other arm , currently under the hiciao mask , should exist in the v1247 orionis system @xcite if the currently detected one is planet - induced , because the strength of the arm suggests a massive perturber .",
    "future imaging observations with smaller inner working angle may be able to detect it .",
    "we extend the previous work by @xcite to examine synthetic nir images of spiral arms produced by puffing up 2d hydro surface density maps , and compare them with synthetic images directly based on 3d hydro simulations .",
    "the inner arms in the formal are significantly weaker than in the latter , due to the missing of vertical kinematic support ( figure  [ fig:2d3d ] ) .",
    "thus , 3d hydro simulations are needed in order to study the morphology of planet - induced arms .",
