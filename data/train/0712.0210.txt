    "the hall effect is a fundamental transport phenomenon in solids that an applied electric current induces a transverse voltage drop , or an applied electric field produces a transverse current  @xcite . in conventional semiconductors and metals , this hall current linear in a weak magnetic field @xmath16 offers a mean to probe an effective carrier number through the normal hall coefficient @xmath17 . in contrast to this normal hall effect driven by the lorentz force , a spontaneous magnetization as well bears the hall effect in ferromagnets  @xcite , where the relativistic spin - orbit interaction is indispensable for connecting the spin polarization with the orbital motion of electrons .",
    "this phenomenon , i.e. , _ spontaneous or anomalous hall effect _",
    "@xcite , has been one of the most fundamental and intriguing issues in condensed - matter physics .",
    "early experimental works led an empirical relation of the hall resistivity @xmath18 to the _ weak _ applied magnetic field @xmath19 and the spontaneous magnetization @xmath20 both along the @xmath21 direction ; @xmath22 with @xmath23 being called the anomalous hall coefficient  @xcite .",
    "similar spontaneous or anomalous effects are also found in thermoelectric and thermal transport phenomena as the anomalous nernst - ettingshausen effect and the anomalous luduc - righi effect , respectively . in spite of the intensive and extensive studies for many decades  @xcite , a long standing debate on the mechanism",
    "has not been resolved yet .",
    "the keen issues are roles of scattering and the associated relaxation and dissipation .",
    "in particular , the intrinsic vs. extrinsic mechanisms and the associated scaling behaviors  @xcite of the anomalous hall effect have attracted revived interest because of the fundamental importance of the dissipationless and topological nature of the intrinsic mechanism , which penetrates the whole debates on this issue  @xcite .    in a recent letter  @xcite , we have presented a unified theory of the anomalous hall effect , fully taking account of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic contributions on an equal footing .",
    "now , main aims of this paper are ( i ) to provide a comprehensive description of the unified theory of the anomalous electric , thermoelectric , and thermal hall transport coefficients with some important details of the formalism and the calculation procedure , ( ii ) to explain key experimental observations in various ferromagnetic metals , including the magnitudes of @xmath6 and @xmath5 and their scaling relations , by means of the classification into three regimes revealed by the theory , and accordingly ( iii ) to resolve the long standing controversy on the mechanism .",
    "the dissipationless and topological nature involved in the hall effect has been highlighted by the discovery of quantum hall effect  @xcite in two - dimensional ( @xmath24 ) disordered electron systems under a _",
    "strong _ magnetic field . for the bloch electrons in perfect crystal ,",
    "the hall conductivity is expressed by the thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - nijs ( tknn ) formula  @xcite , @xmath25 with the electronic charge @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , the planck constant @xmath28 , the fermi distribution function @xmath29 , and the anti - symmetric tensor @xmath30 .",
    "we have introduced the eigenenergy @xmath31 , the berry - phase connection @xmath32 and the berry - phase curvature @xmath33 of the generalized bloch wave function @xmath34 with the band index @xmath35 and the bloch momentum @xmath36 .",
    "each band is characterized by a topological integer called the chern number @xmath37 the sum of @xmath38 over the occupied bands determines the integer @xmath39 ( chern number ) for the quantization of the hall conductivity @xmath40 .",
    "then , in ideal cases when the fermi level is located within an energy gap , the longitudinal conductivity @xmath6 vanishes and the hall conductivity @xmath5 is quantized in a unit of @xmath41 .",
    "this berry - phase effect has been incorporated into the adiabatic semi - classical wave - packet equations for the boltzmann transport theory  @xcite .",
    "historically , the dissipationless thermodynamic hall current was first discussed by karplus - luttinger  @xcite .",
    "they initiated an intrinsic mechanism of the anomalous hall effect in a band model for ferromagnetic metals with the spin - orbit interaction . recognizing that the inter - band matrix element of the current operator plays a key role , they derived a generic expression for the band - intrinsic contribution to the anomalous hall conductivity , which is independent of the scattering rate .",
    "this accounts for the experimentally observed scaling relation for the resistivity tensor @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 or equivalently , @xmath5 being constant .",
    "they also performed a perturbation expansion in @xmath44 and the spin - orbit coupling @xmath45 to derive the empirical law given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_xy ] ) . however , there are two drawbacks in the theory .",
    "firstly , the perturbation theory for @xmath5 in terms of the spin - orbit interaction energy @xmath46 , which is usually even small compared with the bandwidth or the fermi energy @xmath2 except in the @xmath47 electrons , can not capture a topological nature involved in the intrinsic anomalous hall effect .",
    "recently , it has been recognized that the karplus - luttinger s general expression for the band - intrinsic contribution actually coincides with the tknn formula given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tknn ] )  @xcite , and that each band contains a finite chern number  @xcite , as in the quantum hall systems . without the spin - orbit interaction , the hamiltonians describing the majority and minority spin bands are decoupled in the band theory .",
    "then , the fact that the hamiltonians and the bloch wavefunctions are real requires the accidental degeneracy of band dispersions in the three - dimensional brillouin zone  @xcite . turning on the spin - orbit interaction , this condition no longer holds and then the accidental band crossings are avoided , leaving a small energy separation of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "namely , the spin - orbit interaction plays a crucial role in avoiding a crossing of band dispersions at a certain momentum @xmath48 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : crossing ] ) .",
    "this avoided - crossing of band dispersions is accompanied by a transfer of chern numbers among the two - dimensional bands .",
    "this phenomenon called `` parity anomaly '' in @xmath49 dimensions has a non - perturbative nature  @xcite : @xmath5 exhibits a discontinuous jump by @xmath50 as @xmath51 continuously changes its sign .",
    "this points to an importance of the avoided - crossing of band dispersions near the chemical potential .",
    "therefore , the nontrivial topological structure in the bloch wave functions of ferromagnets is not captured by the perturbative treatment  @xcite of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath45 leading to the empirical law given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_xy ] ) with @xmath52 .",
    "this picture based on the `` parity anomally '' has been supported by recent first - principles calculations .",
    "when the fermi level is located around such an avoided - crossing of dispersions , as found in recent _ ab inito",
    "_ calculations for srruo@xmath53  @xcite , the bcc fe  @xcite , cucr@xmath54se@xmath55br@xmath56  @xcite , co  @xcite , and ni  @xcite , the magnitude of @xmath57 is resonantly enhanced ; @xmath58 with the lattice constant @xmath59    @xcite , which can be regarded as an nearly quantized @xmath5 in each two - dimensional momentum plane or @xmath60 .",
    "this resonant enhancement of @xmath5 without any small factor of @xmath46 means that the perturbation expansion in @xmath61 fails when the fermi level is located within the energy range of the avoided - crossing of band dispersions . in the metallic system , there appear many avoided - crossings and/or more complex structures near the fermi level , which may lead to a complex behavior of @xmath5 as a function of the chemical potential , the magnetization , and the crystal structure analogous to the quantum chaos , as actually found in first - principles calculations  @xcite .",
    "interference among the contributions from different bands and/or different momentum regions may often reduces the magnitude of @xmath5 , but its variation is of the order of @xmath62 in both calculations and experiments on srruo@xmath53  @xcite .     and ( b ) an avoided - crossing with a splitting of the dispersions by @xmath63 at this momentum region.,width=302 ]    secondly , scattering events extrinsic to the band structure were completely ignored in the karplus - luttinger s theory  @xcite .",
    "in fact , adiabatic semi - classical boltzmann transport analyses  @xcite , which have also been taken over to the extrinsic scenario for the spin hall effect  @xcite , have revealed that the spin - orbit interaction in the impurity potential produces the anomalous hall effect through the skew scattering or equivalently the mott scattering  @xcite and the side jump  @xcite .",
    "the skew - scattering contribution diverges in the clean limit ( @xmath64 ) as @xmath65 here , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is the skewness factor with the density of states @xmath9 , the fermi energy @xmath2 , and the impurity potential strength @xmath8 , respectively . accordingly ,",
    "luttinger reconsidered the issue by means of the expansions of @xmath5 in @xmath8  @xcite and the impurity concentration @xmath1  @xcite , or in @xmath68 with the relaxation time @xmath69 .",
    "then , the leading - order term is proportional to @xmath70 , which corresponds to the skew - scattering contribution  @xcite . the subleading - order term , which is of the zeroth order in @xmath8 and @xmath1 , includes the original karplus - luttinger s result  @xcite as well as some other terms that partiallly cancel the intrinsic contribution .",
    "the side - jump contribution has the form  @xcite @xmath71 in the clean limit , with the electron density @xmath72 and the relativistic aharonov - cacher coupling @xmath73 leading to an energy shift by @xmath74 due to the applied electric field @xmath75 .",
    "it is remarkable that this side - jump contribution is insensitive to the relaxation rate , leading to the scaling relation @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , it can be incorporated into the subleading term in the luttinger s expansion of @xmath5 .    in the conventional quantum transport theory given by luttinger  @xcite ,",
    "the anomalous hall conductivity is expanded in @xmath3 .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath76 is the only key expansion parameter .",

    "( [ eq : luttinger1 ] ) as a skew - scattering contribution is dominant over the other terms in the clean metal @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , it has been believed that the extrinsic skew - scattering mechanism is dominant  @xcite , as supported by some experiments around the ferromagnetic curie temperature  @xcite and in heavy - fermion compounds showing a large susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many experimental and theoretical works support the karplus - luttinger s scenario . at a fixed impurity potential strength @xmath8 , experimental results on fe- and ni - based dilute alloys  @xcite , cucr@xmath54se@xmath55br@xmath56  @xcite , and semiconducting helimagnets fe@xmath83co@xmath84si and fe@xmath83mn@xmath84si  @xcite appeared to be consistent with the karplus - luttinger s prediction @xmath85 .",

    "( [ eq : tknn ] ) also show large values of @xmath86 which agree with the experimentally observed values at low temperatures .",
    "the agreement is not consistent with a simple - minded perturbation expantion of the intrinsic contribution in @xmath61 , namely , the second term in the square bracket of eq .",
    "( [ eq : luttinger1 ] ) or ( [ eq : luttinger2 ] ) .",
    "this points to the importance of the resonat enhancement due to the topological nature and urges a reexamination of the intrinsic mechanism against the extrinsic one .",
    "theoretically , the two characters involved in the anomalous hall effect have not been seriously considered on an equal footing .",
    "a unified description of both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions is called for .",
    "it is also helpful to develop a theory of the anomalous thermoelectric hall ( nernst - eittingshausen ) effect and the anomalous thermal hall ( leduc - righi ) effect in the same theoretical framework . to provide",

    "a simple model that fully takes into account both the `` parity anomaly '' associated with the avoided - crossing of band dispersions and the impurity scattering can be obtained by expanding the hamiltonian at a fixed @xmath60 with respect to the momentum @xmath36 measured from the originally crossing point @xmath48 of two dispersions ;    @xmath87    [ eq : hs ]    with the position @xmath88 of electron , the pauli and identity matrices @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , and the unit vector @xmath91 in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the first term corresponds to the level splitting @xmath92 of two bands at the avoided - crossing momentum .",

    ". however , note the significant difference in the physical interpretation of the model parameters . in the present model for ferromagnetic metals",
    ", @xmath98 plays the role of the spin - orbit interaction that lifts the accidental degeneracy of two band dispersions with the velocity @xmath93 , while for semiconductors , @xmath93 is the spin - orbit coupling and @xmath99 is the zeeman splitting .    for simplicity , we also assume that the impurity potential has the @xmath100-functional form of the strength @xmath8 at random positions @xmath101 , since as we will show , this simple form bears the extrinsic skew - scattering and side - jump contributions .",
    "the generalization to long - range potential is straitforward but requires rather lengthy calculations . here ,",
    "note the sgnificant difference in the way of taking the impurity average .",
    "one might think that the conventional scheme of taking the average over the impurity positions , which we adopt , might be mimicked by taking the potential average in the white noise model or the random potential model . however , this is true only within the born approximation .",
    "in fact , the higher - order scattering proccesses , which are crucial for the skew - scattering contribution , can not be correctly reproduced by the random potential model .",
    "frist let us consider the model in the absence of the impurities .",
    "this model has two band dispersions @xmath102 separated by @xmath103 with @xmath104 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "henceforth , the bottom of the lower band in the absence of impurities is chosen as the origin of the energy and the bottom of the upper band denoted as @xmath105 is taken as an energy unit .",

    "therefore , the present model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hs ] ) , can be regarded as a minimal continuum model for a momentum region that gives a major contribution to the anomalous hall effect .    actually in the simplest case with the inversion and time - reversal symmetry",
    ", the massless dirac fermion structure may appear at high symmetry points in pair .",
    "they contain chern numbers with opposite signs as in the honeycomb lattice  @xcite for graphenes .",
    "then , the ferromagnetic moment along the @xmath21 direction , which breaks the time - reversal symmetry , together with the spin - orbit interaction avoids the crossing of band dispersions and introduces a energy gap separating two dispersions .",
    "this transfers the chern numbers among different band indices . in three dimensions",
    ", there occurs a transfer of the chern numbers among different values of the momentum component @xmath60 . in these cases with avoided - crossing of band dispersions ,",
    "a complete interference among the topological contribution to the hall conductivity does not occur in general .",
    "the transfer of the chern numbers can also occur along momentum curves , for instance , along the @xmath21 direction parallel to the magnetization . in this case , the two - dimensional massive dirac - fermion structures studied in the present paper appear at each @xmath60 , and @xmath98 continuously changes as a function of @xmath60 with or without a sign change .",
    "it is likely that there is at least one such structure across the fermi level , which is not accompanied by the sign change below the fermi level .",
    "then , even the integration of the two - dimensional anomalous hall conductivity over @xmath60 does not lead to a cancellation of the topological contribution , and hence it remains of the order of @xmath62 even for complicated band structures found in first - principles calcualtions  @xcite .",
    "we employ the nonequilibrium green s function method based on the keldysh formalism  @xcite , which has recently been reformulated in the gauge - covariant wigner representation for generic multi - component systems  @xcite . in the linear order in the electromagnetic field",

    "this automatically satisfies the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "this formalism also reveals that there appear two mathematically independent self - consistent equations for the linear deviation of quantum distribution function in the electric field , one for the fermi - surface contribution and the other for the quantum contribution .",
    "this is usually not easy to recognize in the integral equation for the vertex correction in the kubo formalism .",
    "following our previous paper  @xcite , we consider the green s functions @xmath115 and the self - energies @xmath116 under the _ constant _ applied electric field @xmath75 , which is taken along the @xmath117 direction in this paper , i.e. , @xmath118 . here , the superscripts @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 correspond to the retarded , the advanced and the lesser components , respectively .",

    "this gauge - covariant wigner representation is advantageous over the other choices , since it minimally reduces the arguments of the green s functions and the self - energies .",

    "<S> this theory becomes exact with a single impurity and is appropriate for treating the dilute limit of the impurity concentration @xmath1 . with the fermi energy @xmath2 and the spin - orbit interaction energy @xmath3 being fixed ( @xmath4 ) , three regimes and the associated two crossovers </S>",
    "<S> are found in the anomalous hall conductivity @xmath5 as a function of @xmath1 that controls the longitudinal conductivity @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) in the superclean case with the relaxation rate @xmath7 , the skew scattering arising from the vertex correction yields a dominant contribution that is inversely proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath8 is the impurity potential strength and @xmath9 is the density of states . with increasing @xmath10 , this extrinsic skew - scattering contribution rapidly decays . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) in the moderately dirty regime @xmath11 , @xmath5 becomes insensitive to the scattering strength because of the intrinsic dissipationless topological berry - phase contribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is resonantly enhanced to the order of the quantization unit of conductance , when an accidental degeneracy of band dispersions around the fermi level is lifted by the spin - orbit interaction . further increasing @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , another crossover occurs to ( iii ) the scaling regime of @xmath12 with @xmath13 , which has recently been verified by experiments on a wide class of ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> similar behaviors also appear in the temperature - linear coefficient of the themal hall conductivity @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the thermoelectric hall conductivity @xmath15 strongly diverges in the clean limit when the fermi level crosses edges of the avoided - crossing , which may be observed by careful experiments . with increasing @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , there occurs an interference beteween positive and negative contributions to @xmath15 , which often leads to a sign change and obscures similar crossovers in the anomalous nernst effect . </S>"
