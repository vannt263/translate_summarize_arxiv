    "high harmonic generation ( hhg ) is an extreme non linear optical up - conversion process driven with an intense ultra - short laser pulse , usually interacting with noble gas atoms @xcite .",
    "the up - converted light can easily reach the extreme uv portion of the spectrum and in certain cases can extend up to kev x - ray photon energies @xcite . at the single atom level",
    "the process of hhg is most simply described by the three step model @xcite consisting of electron ionization , laser - driven acceleration and recombination upon which excess kinetic energy is released in the form of a high energy photon .",
    "macroscopically , due to dispersion and geometric effects such as wave - guiding and focusing , the efficient build up of each harmonic order is limited to its coherence length @xmath0 which is the distance at which the accumulated phase difference between the pump beam and the harmonic emission is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "here , @xmath2 is the momentum phase mismatch - the difference between the waves vectors of the pump beam and the q order harmonic signal at the direction of propagation .",
    "perfect phase matching conditions , @xmath3 , can be achieved at low intensities ( low ionization rates ) and loose focusing @xcite . however ,",
    "when working with a strong pump beam , plasma dispersion becomes dominant and phase matching is not possible @xcite .",
    "thus , a different approach is required for achieving efficient build up of the emitted radiation .",
    "the solution comes in the form of an ordered modulation of a parameter relevant to the interaction , which allows the restrictive momentum conservation condition associated with perfect phase matching to be replaced with a less restrictive condition @xcite known as quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) @xcite . in particular using a periodic spatial modulation allows quasi - phase - matching when @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the period of the modulation .    to date ,",
    "most of the works applying qpm on hhg , did this by modulating the medium properties@xcite while others showed all optical qpm theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . while some of these works demonstrated tunability they were associated with mechanically moving components .",
    "in addition , although a relatively simple method for a co - propagating all optical qpm was suggested @xcite , the all - optical methods that were demonstrated experimentally involved counter - propagating geometries which led to relatively complicated front ends @xcite .    here",
    "we present an all - optical co - propagating scheme for qpm of hhg in a semi - infinite gas cell configuration , allowing for non - mechanical , on - the - fly and complete control of the parameters of a perturbing periodic standing - wave modulation .",
    "in particular , the period of the modulation , its overall length and the depth of the modulation are easily controlled . with this scheme",
    "we experimentally demonstrate tunable qpm of harmonic orders 25 to 39 , with enhancement of up to 30 fold .",
    "hhg in a so called semi - infinite gas cell @xcite is driven with a pump beam which is focused to a point at the vicinity of a small exit hole in a thin foil terminating a gas cell .",
    "vacuum conditions are established immediately after the cell . the phase mismatch for the generation of the q - th harmonic",
    "is given by : @xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the harmonic order , @xmath8 is the pump wave vector , @xmath9 is the q - th harmonic wave vector , @xmath10 is the gas pressure , @xmath11 is the ionization rate at time of emission of the harmonic radiation , @xmath12 is the pump wavelength , @xmath13 is the difference of refractive indices of neutral gas atoms between the pump and the harmonic radiation , @xmath14 is the number density of atoms at atmospheric pressure , @xmath15 is the classic electron radius , @xmath16 is the geometric phase and finally @xmath17 is the intrinsic phase of the atomic dipole which is proportional to the pump intensity @xcite .",
    "the two pressure - dependent terms in eq.[eq : deltak ] are due to gas and plasma dispersion respectively .",
    "the third term is the geometric wave vector mismatch which is usually approximated to depend only on the geometric variation of the pump phase and is mostly associated with either wave guiding effects or with focusing in free propagation ( contributing a gouy phase term ) . in the present case , the use of a structured pump beam made of the interference of a gaussian and a bessel beam would modulate both the geometric and the intrinsic phase terms .",
    "the spatial spectral decomposition of a bessel beam @xcite is made of a continuum of plane waves aligned on the surface of a cone with a half angle @xmath18 with respect to the propagation axis .",
    "the difference between the gaussian wave vector @xmath19 and the on - axis projection @xmath20 of the bessel wave vector , is denoted with @xmath21 ( see fig.[fig : deltak].(b ) ) .",
    "when the two beams are superposed coaxially to produce a structured pump beam , a periodic intensity and phase modulation , with an underlying period of @xmath22 , emerges on axis ( see fig.[fig : deltak].(c ) ) .    the on - axis intensity and geometric phase of the structured pump beam can be roughly estimated by :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the amplitude modulation depth ( amplitude ratio between the bessel and gaussian fields at the focus of the bessel beam ) , @xmath25 is the on - axis gouy phase of the gaussian beam where @xmath26 is the gaussian beam rayleigh range , @xmath27 is the total intensity of the superimposed beams , @xmath28 is the intensity of the gaussian beam and @xmath29 is the non - diffracting distance which is defined later in eq.[eq : l_nd ] .",
    "the intensity modulation acts on both the amplitude and on the phase components of the nonlinear polarization which has a tendency to oppose each other for emission buildup associated with qpm @xcite . in the current case , taking all modulation factors into account , the modulation depth of the amplitude and of the phase of the nonlinear polarization is different , thus the overall modulation can be used , as we verify here , to realize an efficient all - optical co - propagating qpm scheme .    in order to produce a superposition of a gaussian and a bessel beams at the interaction region ,",
    "we split a gaussian beam to two and modulate the spatial distribution of one part using a spatial light modulator ( slm ) .",
    "the modulated beam obtains the shape of a ring which is a fourier transform of a bessel beam @xcite . focusing the ring in a 2f configuration creates a bessel beam which is non - diffracting along a distance @xmath29 around the focus of the lens ( see fig.[fig : deltak].(a ) ) . using simple geometrical optics",
    "it can be shown that @xmath29 is dependent on the ring thickness @xmath30 , radius @xmath31 and the lens focal length @xmath32 : @xmath33    , generated by focusing a ring amplitude field distribution in a 2f geometry .",
    "( b ) the wave vectors of the interfering gaussian beam @xmath19 and the bessel beam @xmath20 .",
    "the on - axis difference between the wave vectors is @xmath21 .",
    "( c ) a volumetric representation of the intensity of the superposed gaussian and bessel beams ]    when the structured beam is used as a pump for hhg , quasi phase matching for the q - th harmonic order can be achieved when @xmath34 . for a given focal length @xmath32 ,",
    "the radius of the imaged ring , r , determines the angle @xmath18 of the bessel wave vectors and consequently determines the value of @xmath21 :    @xmath35    the number of periods within the modulation is given with @xmath36 where @xmath29 in turn is dependent on the thickness of the imaged ring ( see eq.[eq : l_nd ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath29 determines the effective phase - matching bandwidth @xmath37 which roughly behaves as @xmath38 .",
    "this follows from approximating the intensity buildup of the harmonic emission for a given modulation depth as proportional to @xmath39 @xcite with @xmath40 being any given value of the phase mismatch .",
    "however , it is important to note , that for an efficient use of the available number of periods ( as well as for the last approximation to be of any value ) it is essential that the effective interaction length , determined by the gaussian rayleigh range , is at least as long as @xmath29 .",
    "this is easily accomplished by using a shallower focusing for the gaussian beam than for the bessel beam .",
    "the depth of the modulation is determined by the ratio of the intensities of the two beams .",
    "using thinner rings increases @xmath29 but decreases the intensity of the bessel beam and so reduces the modulation depth .",
    "another factor that modifies the modulation depth is the ring radius - due to the gaussian profile of the beam reflecting of the slm , larger ring radius would decrease the intensity of the bessel beam .",
    "finally , the modulation depth can also be tuned by adjusting the overall transmission of any given ring , which is also controllable with the slm . in our experiment",
    "the rings transmission was set to its maximum value .    as the radius and width of the rings",
    "are controlled by the software operating the slm it is very easy to exert on - the - fly control on the geometric parameters of the quasi - phase - matching modulation - effectively changing the center of the phase - matching curve @xmath21 , its bandwidth @xmath37 and its modulation depth .      in the experiment an intense gaussian beam and a perturbing bessel beam",
    "are combined and focused together in a semi - infinite gas cell ( sigc ) .",
    "the exact parameters of the bessel beam are easily determined using a computer - controlled beam shaper based on a phase - only spatial light modulator ( slm ) set in amplitude configuration ( see methods ) . in the interaction region the beams interfere and form a periodic standing wave pattern ( see fig.[fig : deltak].(c ) ) .",
    "the rayleigh range of the gaussian beam that was used is 5 mm .",
    "the non - diffracting bessel region @xmath29 varies between 1.4 mm and 8.3 mm while the periodicity of the induced periodic modulation varies from 200@xmath41 m to 430@xmath41 m .",
    "thus the range of the number of periods in the modulation can vary between 3 to 41 .",
    "these ranges are determined by the slm area and by the imaging optics being used in the setup .        the hhg spectrum for harmonic orders 25 to 39 when only the gaussian beam is present and focused to 1.5 mm before the exit hole of the sigc ,",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : results ] ( in blue ) . at the absence of the modulation due to the interference with the bessel beam , the harmonic orders are not phase matched and",
    "therefore do not build - up efficiently .",
    "the addition of a bessel beam with a specific cone angle for generating a modulation with the appropriate periodicity needed to phase match the harmonic orders under scrutiny , led to a substantial enhancement of these harmonics .",
    "some of the harmonic orders that were nearly undetected before the addition of the bessel , due to poor phase matching condition , became significant .    the conditions at which the harmonic radiation is most efficient is a complicated function of the time - dependent intensity : higher intensity yields a stronger dipole moment , however it also increases the ionization rate which changes the phase mismatch .",
    "we assume that the applied periodic modulation which provides the highest enhancement of the harmonic radiation matches the actual phase mismatch .",
    "for example , applying a modulation of @xmath42 the strongest enhancement was observed for the 33 harmonic therefor we conclude that @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , this corresponds to ionization rate of @xmath44 when using eq.[eq : deltak ] , while the maximum ionization rate is 0.81 ( see methods ) .",
    "this suggests that the best conditions for the generation of this harmonic order are at the leading edge of the pulse and not at its maximum .",
    "increasing the frequency of the modulation @xmath21 , by modifying the radius of the ring on the slm ( for a fixed ring width , in which case the phase matching bandwidth is @xmath45 ) we clearly observe a displacement of the band of phase - matched harmonics to higher orders .",
    "this is easily seen for the integrated intensity enhancement shown in the inset in fig.[fig : results ] ( a ) .",
    "the enhancement was calculated by dividing the integrated intensity of each harmonic order by the integrated intensity of the same harmonic order produced by the unperturbed gaussian beam . the observed displacement is in accordance with the expected linear dependence of the phase mismatch on the harmonic order ( see eq.[eq : deltak ] ) .",
    "this verifies that the observed enhancement is due to quasi - phase - matching ( furthermore , we remind that the intensity of the perturbing bessel beam is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the gaussian beam and so the added intensity alone can not account for any observed enhancement ) . overall the most enhanced harmonic order is scanned from the 27th to the 37rd harmonic and enhancement of up to 23 times can be observed for this particular case of relative positions of the focus of both beams and the exit hole of the sigc .",
    "next we modify the phase - matching bandwidth @xmath37 by modifying the ring thickness on the slm , while keeping a constant value of @xmath46 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : results](b ) with the integrated enhancement presented in the inset .",
    "theoretically , according to the simplest qpm models @xcite , the phase matching bandwidth should grow linearly with @xmath37 . analyzing the results we find that the linear fit of the phase matching bandwidth to @xmath37 in our case has an @xmath47 fitting parameter of 0.81 .",
    "in addition we see a redshift of the phase matched bandwidth which is not accounted for by simple models .",
    "( other colors ) for a fixed phase matching bandwidth of @xmath45 .",
    "inset : the integrated intensity enhancement of each harmonic order for different @xmath21 .",
    "( b ) harmonic spectra produced by a gauss beam only ( blue ) and with a modulation caused by an addition of a co - propagating bessel beam with different @xmath37 ( other colors ) .",
    "inset : the integrated intensity enhancement of each harmonic order for different @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the radius of the bessel ring corresponded to @xmath48     is varied and the integrated harmonic enhancement is calculated . in all cases the focus of the bessel beam is fixed at 1 mm before the sigc exit .",
    "( a ) experimental results .",
    "( b ) numerical results ( normalized ) .",
    "modulation depth @xmath49 of the experiment ( c ) numerical results ( normalized ) .",
    "modulation depth @xmath44 of the experiment .",
    "neglecting geometric phase modulation . ]",
    "the above set of measurements was repeated for several different locations of the focus of the gaussian beam with respect to the output of the sigc , while keeping the position of the bessel focus constant . by doing so , the qpm process takes place at different positions with respect to the gaussian focus . the measured harmonics enhancement for the different cases",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : diffrdiffpos](a ) .",
    "the highest observed enhancement in this set of measurements is 30 fold . but more importantly - assuming that the frequency of the modulation upon phase matching is close to the phase mismatch without the modulation , it is obvious that in all cases the phase mismatch depends linearly on the harmonic order : @xmath50 with both @xmath51 and @xmath52 dependent on the position of the focus of the gaussian beam .",
    "the dependency of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 coefficients on the location upon the gaussian beam profile can easily be explained using eq.[eq : deltak ] .",
    "the phase mismatch terms that are influenced by the changing of the location upon the gaussian beam profile are the third and fourth terms ( assuming that the pressure drops significantly only after the exit hole of the sigc ) .",
    "the third term changes the proportionality factor in @xmath7 and so we can observe an increase in @xmath51 as the location gets nearer the focus of the gaussian beam . at the same time , the fourth term increases together with the gradient of the intensity profile - increasing b as a consequence .",
    "a basic , even simplistic , simulation ( see methods ) can capture the salient features of the observed results .",
    "we have fixed the geometric parameters of the simulations ( focal location of the beams ) according to the experiment .",
    "we explored a vast range of parameter space relating to the modulation depth of the perturbation , the ionization level , the intensity - proportionality factor of the intrinsic atomic phase , the ambient pressure , and the pressure gradient around the sigc exit . in all cases where the perturbation is small enough the same general behavior",
    "is observed as in the experiment .",
    "however we did had to choose a much smaller perturbation than estimated in the experiment or neglect the effect of the qpm modulation on the geometric phase ( see fig.[fig : diffrdiffpos ] ( b)-(c ) ) to get similar results to the experiment .",
    "otherwise the numerical result are much noisier .",
    "the form of the perturbation of both the modulated intrinsic phase ( proportional to the intensity ) and of the modulated geometric phase are similar in form ( behave as a sine function ) while the main difference between the two - is that the intrinsic phase sine - like modulation sits upon a gaussian background and the geometric phase upon an arctangent background ( the gouy phase ) , our simulations indicate that , for the 1d simplistic model , the combination of the sine - like modulation and the gouy background together is the main source for the deviation from the experimental results .",
    "a plausible explanation for the difference between the parameters of the experiment and the simulation ( to yield similar result ) is that experimentally we gather harmonic radiation integrated over some effective transverse area of an interaction which is missing in the 1d model .",
    "in addition , the temporal dynamics ( that is - the dependency of the dipole moment and of the phase mismatch on time ) are missing in the simplistic numerical model we used and their effect on the phase matching dynamics can be quite involved @xcite .",
    "still , in both the experiment and simulations the linear behavior of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath7 is apparent , while the behavior of the offset parameter @xmath52 as a function of the gaussian focus between the two is very similar .",
    "we have demonstrated experimentally driving of hhg using a structured pump beam made of the superposition of a gaussian and a tunable perturbing bessel beam .",
    "the structured beam is able to perform on - the - fly , tunable quasi - phase - matching of the harmonic spectra - with controlled band and bandwidth .",
    "we have demonstrated qpm of harmonics generated at different locations upon the main gaussian beam .",
    "the flexibility of this method and its relatively easy implementation would allow to use a more complicated structured beams in order to control further parameters of the emitted radiation . for example - use of aperiodic modulations could allow for phase matching several different bandwidths .",
    "it would also be very interesting to extend the use of structured pump beams to control other degrees of freedom of the harmonic emission , such as polarization states @xcite and orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "additionally , perturbedly structured beams might be helpful to analyze in - situ conditions ( such as ionization level , coherence length etc . ) at different locations during the process of hhg .",
    "finally , the all - optical technique presented here might also be applicable to perturbative nonlinear optical frequency conversion in nonlinear crystals @xcite .",
    "to attain a relatively long rayleigh range for the gaussian beam , and significant cone half angles @xmath18 for the bessel beam , different focusing conditions are required for the two beams . as such , the output beam of a 1khz , 35fs ti : sapphire amplifier ( coherent legend usx )",
    "is split into two paths ( see fig.[fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the first beam having 0.4mj per pulse , retains its spatial gaussian profile , and is used as the main pump beam .",
    "this intense beam also drills a through hole at the aluminum foil terminating the gas cell ( in a semi - infinite gas cell ( sigc ) configuration ) . the second beam with a typical peak intensity which is only about 1.5@xmath53 of the first beam ( when material dispersion and achromatic pulse front tilt due to focusing are taken into account @xcite )",
    ", undergoes an amplitude modulation using two perpendicularly oriented polarizers and a phase - only spatial - light - modulator ( slm , holoeye pluto ) in - between .",
    "this beam acquires a spatial distribution of a ring which is then imaged and focused to form a bessel beam ( see fig.[fig : deltak].(a ) ) .",
    "both beams are combined using a holed mirror and are focused close to the output of the sigc .",
    "the use of a holed mirror is possible because the bessel beam retain its ring shape before the focus . in the interaction region",
    "the beams interfere and form a periodic standing wave pattern ( see fig.[fig : deltak].(c ) ) .",
    "modifying the position of both focusing lenses ( lg and lb3 in fig.[fig : setup ] ) allows for a careful selection of both the location of the interaction region with respect to the aluminum foil and the relative focus of both beams .",
    "the backing pressure of the sigc was 15 torr .",
    "the power of the gaussian beam at the interaction region was 420 mw corresponding to a maximum ionization rate of 0.81 and to the hhg cutoff to correspond to the 187 harmonic order .",
    "the harmonic orders observed in the experiment are far below the cut - off .",
    "we have calculated using standard fresnel propagation the on - axis spatial component of the structured beam .",
    "then we approximated the behavior of the hhg field by integrating for each harmonic order the equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the density number of emitters and is proportional to the pressure @xmath10 , @xmath56 is the pressure - dependent power absorption coefficient of the @xmath7-th harmonic with @xmath2 calculated using eq.[eq : deltak ] where the geometric phase is taken from the pump field propagation calculation .",
    "the gas pressure gradient in the interaction region was calculated according to @xcite .",
    "we chose the power factor @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we assumed that only short trajectories are contributing to the emission by choosing the proportionality factor of the intrinsic atomic phase to the field intensity to be @xmath58 ( its actual value varies among various models @xcite ) .",
