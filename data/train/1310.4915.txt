    "parameterized algebraic surfaces are ubiquitous in geometric modeling because they are used to describe the boundary of 3-dimensional shapes . to manipulate them",
    ", it is very useful to have an implicit representation in addition to their given parametric representation .",
    "indeed , a parametric representation is for instance well adapted for drawing or sampling whereas an implicit representation allows significant improvements in intersection problems that are fundamental operations appearing in geometric processing for visualization , analysis and manufacturing of geometric models .",
    "thus , there exists a rich literature on the change of representation from a parametric to an implicit representation under the classical form of a polynomial implicit equation .",
    "although this problem can always be solved in principle , for instance via grbner basis computations , its practical implementation is not enough efficient to be useful in practical applications in geometric modeling for general parameterized surfaces .    in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "alternative implicit representations of parameterized surfaces under the form of a matrix have been considered .",
    "the first family of such representations comes from the resultant theory that produces a non - singular matrix whose determinant yields an implicit equation from a given surface parameterization . but the main advantage is also the main drawback of these resultant matrices : since they are universal with respect to the coefficients of the given surface parameterization , they are very easy to build in practice , but they are also very sensitive to the presence of base points . as a consequence ,",
    "a particular resultant matrix has to be designed for each given particular class of parameterized surfaces .",
    "a second family of implicit matrix representations is based on the syzygies of the coordinates of a surface parameterization .",
    "initiated by the geometric modeling community @xcite , these matrices have been deeply explored in a series of papers ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "compared to the resultant matrices , they are still very easy to build , although not universal , but their sensitivity to the presence of base points is much weaker .",
    "however , these matrices are in general singular matrices and the recovering of the classical implicit equation from them is more involved .",
    "therefore , to be useful these matrices have to be seen as implicit representations on their own , without relying on the more classical implicit equation . in this spirit",
    ", the use of these singular matrix representations has recently been explored for addressing the curve / surface and surface / surface intersection problems @xcite .    as a continuation ,",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the self - intersection locus of a surface parameterization through its matrix representations .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a parameterization from @xmath4 to @xmath2 of a rational algebraic surface @xmath5 and let @xmath6 be one of its matrix representations .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the drop of rank of @xmath6 at a given point @xmath7 is in relation with the fiber of the graph of @xmath0 over @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the fitting ideals attached to @xmath6 provide a filtration of the surface which is in correspondence with the degree and the dimension of the fibers of the graph of the parameterization @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that this kind of results have already been investigated for different purposes in the field of intersection theory under the name of multiple - point formulas .",
    "given a finite map of schemes @xmath9 of codimension one , its source and target double - point cycles have been extensively studied ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . moreover , in @xcite fitting ideals are used to give a scheme structure to the multiple - point loci . therefore , in the particular case where @xmath10 has no base point ( hence is a finite map ) , our results are partially contained in the above literature .",
    "thus , the main contribution of this paper is to extend these previous works to the case where @xmath0 is not necessarily a finite map under ubiquitous conditions .",
    "the theory in this article is thus applicable to most of the parameterizations that appear in applications .    in what follows",
    ", we will first briefly overview matrix representations and define some fitting ideals attached to them in section [ sec : def ] .",
    "the main result of this paper is then proved in section [ sec : main ] . section [ sec : comp ] is devoted to the computational aspects of our results . in section [ sec : link ]",
    "we will discuss on the link with multiple - points formulas developed in the field of intersection theory .",
    "finally , we will treat the case of parameterizations @xmath0 whose source is @xmath11 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "this type of parameterizations being widely used in geometric modeling ( see for instance @xcite for a detailed study of a special case ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be a field and @xmath12 be a rational map given by four homogeneous polynomials @xmath13 of degree @xmath14 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath1 the closure of its image .",

    "finally , define the ideal @xmath21 . in the sequel",
    ", we will assume that : @xmath22      the approximation complex of cycles associated to the sequence of polynomials @xmath13 is of the form ( see e.g.  @xcite for an introduction to these complexes in this context ) @xmath23 the map @xmath6 sends a 4-tuple @xmath24 to the form @xmath25 , with the condition that @xmath26 if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "the complex @xmath28 inherits a grading from the canonical grading of the polynomial ring @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the notation @xmath30 stands for the matrix in @xmath31 that corresponds to the degree @xmath32 part of @xmath6 .    under our hypothesis , the symmetric algebra @xmath33 of the ideal @xmath34 is projectively isomorphic to the rees algebra @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "the graph @xmath36 of the parameterization @xmath0 is scheme defined by @xmath37 . as a consequence ,",
    "the approximation complex of cycles @xmath28 can be used to determine an implicit representation of the closed image of @xmath0 , i.e.  the surface @xmath1 ( recall that @xmath38 ) .    under the assumptions , for all integer @xmath39 the matrix @xmath30 of the graded map of free @xmath40-modules @xmath41",
