    "majorana fermions ( mfs ) in condensed matter became the focus of many studies  @xcite , especially in connection with the future possibility of topologically - protected computation  @xcite .",
    "a necessary operation for such a computation is braiding , which could be performed  @xcite by tuning the pairwise interaction between the mfs (  non - topological \" qubit operations  @xcite were also discussed in the literature , refs .  ) .",
    "different structures have been proposed as possible hosts for mfs  @xcite .",
    "preliminary experimental hints of majorana states were observed in a nanowire with strong spin - orbit coupling on top of a superconductor  @xcite , in a ferromagnetic atoms chain  @xcite , and , most recently , in a topological insulator / superconductor ( ti / sc ) heterostructure  @xcite .    it is generally assumed that mfs localize at some heterogeneity separating media with different topological numbers , which may be a vortex core in a superconductor or superfluid , sample boundaries , interfaces in heterostructures , etc .",

    "the attachment of the mf to such a physical  defect \" may be disadvantageous for a number of reasons : the presence of physical inhomogeneities in the system requires additional efforts at the fabrication stage , it introduces extra disorder , and creates interfaces , whose properties are difficult to control",
    ". in particular , binding a mf to some point in space limits its control and manipulation options .    however , it is not a general law that mf must be localized near some  topological defect \" . below we consider two models of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological superconductor hosting a vortex .",
    "systems of this type have been studied experimentally  @xcite , and hints of a majorana state at the vortex core were reported  @xcite . from the theory standpoint , these models are particularly interesting , because , as it will be demonstrated below , they may serve as a platform where a confinement mechanism unrelated to a physical heterogeneity is realized .",
    "the mfs can arise only in pairs , since only a superposition of two mfs has a physical sense  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the well - studied mf at the core  @xcite , a second , exterior , majorana state can emerge  @xcite .",
    "the second mf is not necessarily pinned by some interface or sample edge .",
    "we show that it can be localized by a finite magnetic field . for a uniform field @xmath0 ,",
