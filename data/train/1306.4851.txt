    "<S> the nonlinear thermoelectric properties of serially coupled quantum dots ( scqds ) embedded in a nanowire connected to metallic electrodes are theoretically studied in the coulomb blockade regime . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the electron heat current of scqds exhibit a direction - dependent behavior ( heat rectification ) in an asymmetrical structure in which the electron coulomb interactions are significant . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon thermal conductivity of the nanowire is also calculated , which is used to estimate the phonon heat current . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how to reduce phonon heat current to allow observation of electron heat rectification behavior in the scqd junction system in low temperature regime ( @xmath0 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> transport properties of a single semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) or nanostructure have been experimentally and theoretically studied in the coulomb blockade regime for application as a single electron transistor due to its functionality of charge filtering.@xmath1 it has been proposed that the qd system can be used as a qubit for quantum computation.@xmath2 for the realization of solid state quantum computer , many experimental studies have been devoted to the tunneling current of serially coupled double quantum dots ( dqds).@xmath3 the serially coupled dqds can act as a spin filter when the the pauli spin blockade condition is met.@xmath4 recent experimental works have extended dqds to triple quantum dots ( tqds ) for studying multi electron spin blockade process and leakage current arising from phonon assisted tunneling.@xmath5 however , there has been little study on the energy transfer of such nanostructure junctions including dqds and tqds . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of energy transfer and heat extraction of the nanostructure junction is also crucial in the implementation of solid state quantum register , because the heat accumulation will degrade the performance of quantum computation .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from that , solid state coolers and power generators at nanoscale may be important in the integration of quantum device circuits.@xmath6 unlike electronic nanodevices , it is still a challenge to realize nanoscale solid state thermoelectric devices.@xmath6 up to date , several theoretical studies on the thermoelectric properties of nanostructures have been reported.@xmath7these studies have focused on the thermoelectric properties of qd junctions in the linear response regime rather than nonlinear response . to the best of our knowledge , the nonlinear electron heat transport properties of serially coupled qds ( scqds ) including dqds and tqds have not been reported . here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that dqds and tqds with asymmetrical structures can exhibit direction - dependent electron heat current in the absence of phonon heat current . </S>",
    "<S> such a rectification effect of electron heat current may be masked by the phonon heat current , since phonon carriers dominate the contribution of heat current in nanowires with large cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> thus , only for scqds embedded in a thin nanowire , such heat rectification effect may be realized .    here , we consider nanoscale semiconductor qds , in which the energy level separations are much larger than their on - site coulomb interactions and thermal energies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , only one energy level for each quantum dot needs to be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the extended hubbard model and anderson model are used to describe the scqd system connected to the metallic electrodes.@xmath8 using the keldysh - green s function technique [ 15,18 ] , the charge and heat currents of a dqd [ as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath20 denotes the transmission function , which can be calculated by evaluating the on - site retarded green s function ( gf ) and lesser gf [ 15 ] . the indices @xmath21 and j denote the @xmath21th qd and the @xmath22th qd , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> based on the equation of motion method , we can obtain analytical expressions of all gfs in the coulomb blockade regime . </S>",
    "<S> details are provided in ref . 15 . in the weak interdot limit </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the electron interdot hopping strength and on - site coulomb interaction , respectively ) the transmission function can be recast into a simple closed - form.@xmath26    to study the direction - dependent heat current , we let @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the average of equilibrium temperatures of two side electrodes and @xmath30 is the temperature difference across the junction . because the temperature gradient can induce a significant electrochemical potential difference @xmath31 , now denoted by @xmath32 ( the thermal voltage ) , it is important to take into account the shift of energy level ( @xmath33 ) in each dot according to the expression @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the fraction of voltage difference shared by qd @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath35 depends on the location , shape and dielectric constant of the qd . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath35 is determined solely by the qd location and the voltage difference is uniformly distributed among qds . this is a valid approximation when the dielectric constants of the qd and the surrounding material are similar , which leads to a uniform electric filed in the junction system . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath37 denotes the center position of qd @xmath36 with respect to the mid point of the junction and the separation of two electrodes is @xmath38 , then the electrostatic potential energy due to the uniform electric field seen by an electron in qd @xmath21 is simply @xmath39(-e\\delta v_{th}/d)$ ] ( @xmath40 is along the direction of transport ) . for weak field and symmetric wave function in each qd , the energy correction due to the linear @xmath41 term vanishes up to first order . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have @xmath42 . for the dqd junction , we assume @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    we have numerically solved eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for scqd junctions . </S>",

    "<S> once @xmath32 is solved , we then use eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) to compute the heat current . </S>",
    "<S> we have adopted the following physical parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 . if we adopted an energy unit @xmath51 , then @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .    </S>",

    "<S> the qd energy levels are @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - dot coulomb energy is @xmath59 . a nonlinear behavior of heat current is clearly seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , where the heat current in the forward temperature bias ( @xmath60 ) is much larger than that in the reversed temperature bias ( @xmath61 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this nonlinear behavior in heat current leads to significant thermal rectification effect for the dqd junction system , which depends strongly on @xmath55 . when @xmath62 , the electrochemical potential @xmath32 yielded by temperature bias will not shift the qd energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the thermal rectification effect disappears even though we have @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) shows the corresponding seebeck coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 denotes the seebeck coefficient in the linear response ( @xmath65 ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> a negative @xmath66 value implies that electrons of the hot side electrode diffuse to the cold side electrode via the energy levels @xmath33 above @xmath67.@xmath8 on the other hand , holes of the electrodes are the major diffusion carriers if we have a positive @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> holes are defined as the empty states which are below the fermi energy of electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> note that the relationship between the electron heat current and seebeck coefficient is highly nonlinear , it is hard to verify the electron heat rectification via the measurement of @xmath68 , even though @xmath68 is not influenced by the phonon heat current . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider configurations that lead to large electron heat current , which is in contrast to the pauli spin blockade configuration considered in refs . </S>",
    "<S> 7 and 15 .    to further clarify the rectification behavior shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , we show the heat current ( @xmath54 ) of the dqd junction for various interdot coulomb interactions ( @xmath69 ) in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 1(a ) for @xmath70 . with decreasing @xmath69 , the magnitude of @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> is seriously reduced for large forward temperature bias , and at the same time , the rectification behavior is seriously suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> once all electron coulomb interactions are excluded , the rectification behavior is very small ( not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the heat current rectification is directly related to the electron coulomb interactions , especially the interdot coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> note that there are eight configurations for a electron with spin @xmath71 to diffuse from the hot electrode to the cold electrode [ see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) of ref . </S>",
    "<S> 16 ] . to reveal which channel dominates the heat current @xmath72 , the curve labeled by @xmath73 ( which is calculated by including the @xmath73 configuration alone ) is also plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ( triangles line ) . in the reversed temperature bias , </S>",
    "<S> it matches very well with the solid line ( including eight configurations ) , whereas its magnitude is larger than that of solid line in the forward temperature bias . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly because the @xmath74 channel allows electrons of the cold electrode to transport heat to hot side . </S>",
    "<S> from the results of curve labeled @xmath73 , the heat current is determined by the joint density of states arising from two poles @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are separated by @xmath77 in the small @xmath24 limit . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the heat current in the forward temperature bias is much larger than that in the reversed temperature . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) shows the corresponding seebeck coefficients ( @xmath68 ) for various values of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath78 diminishes as the interdot coulomb interaction decreases , since the tunneling energy levels become closer to the fermi energy of electrodes and the contribution due to holes increases .    to design a good thermal rectifier , it is important to have large heat current and high rectification efficiency . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the rectification efficiency is suppressed when @xmath24 increases ( accompanying an increasing heat current ) . on the other hand </S>",

    "<S> our calculated results imply that it is difficult to verify the existence of electron thermal rectification in either the linear or nonlinear response regime via the measurement of @xmath68 due to unclear relationship between @xmath54 and @xmath68 .    </S>",

    "<S> it is essential to consider large number of coupled qds in the system in order to reduce thermal current arising from phonons.@xmath90 for simplicity , we consider the case of a tqd junction as shown in the inset of fig . 5 , similar to the structure considered in ref . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are still valid for the tqd junction , whereas we need to consider a more complicated transmission coefficient.@xmath91 the tqd junction has 32 configurations for an electron with spin @xmath71 to tunneling between two metallic electrodes.@xmath91 figure 5 shows the heat current ( @xmath54 ) , and heat rectification efficiency for different physical parameters in the tqd junction with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the heat current has a remarkable enhancement for @xmath95 and @xmath96 . if we adopt @xmath51 , then @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 . based on these physical parameters , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to fabricate a realistic tqd junction system to realize the heat rectification behavior as predicted theoretically . as an example , we have calculated the above physical parameters for an @xmath102 qd junction system within the effective mass approximation.@xmath103 for a disk - shaped qd with radius @xmath104 and height @xmath105 , the intradot coulomb interaction is @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> a barrier with width @xmath107 leads to @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . using these realistic physical parameters </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the heat current and heat rectification efficiency versus temperature for @xmath102 qd junction and show them as triangle marks in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . compared to the dotted line , the heat current is suppressed , whereas the rectification efficiency is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the heat current is not a monotonic increasing function of @xmath69 . </S>",
