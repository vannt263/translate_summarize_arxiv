    "<S> .5 in    neutrino astronomy provides a new window to the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly because , contrary to particles with electromagnetic interactions ( i.e. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and so on ) , neutrinos have very weak interaction and are very transparent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the cosmic - ray neutrino spectrum in the present universe contains various information about the production processes of energetic neutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the icecube experiment reported the result of their analysis on high - energy neutrino events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the icecube experiment observed @xmath5 high - energy neutrino events with @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 being the deposited electromagnetic - equivalent energy in detector ) , which is substantially larger than the number of events expected from the atmospheric backgrounds ( which is @xmath8 events ) . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the icecube experiment found two events with deposit energy of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , nicknamed as ernie and bert , respectively ) , while no event with larger @xmath7 has been observed .    </S>",
    "<S> icecube claims the existence of a source of high energy cosmic - ray neutrinos other than the atmospheric one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we may consider particle - physics or astrophysical origin of such high energy neutrinos , the former of which is the subject of our study . </S>",
    "<S> ( possible astrophysical origins include active galactic nuclei @xcite , @xmath4-ray burst @xcite , hypernova remnants @xcite , star - forming galaxies @xcite , galactic cosmic - rays @xcite , neutron - star mergers @xcite and cosmogenic neutrinos @xcite . for other astrophysical discussion , see also @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> although it is premature to make any conclusion , the negative observation of the events with larger energy deposit may indicate that the cosmic - ray neutrino spectrum has a cutoff at the energy around @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we also note that no event is observed in the energy bins between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it may be a consequence of a peak of the cosmic - ray electron neutrino spectrum at @xmath12 ; this is because , within experimental uncertainties , the deposited energy is equal to the energy of the initial - state neutrino for @xmath15 charged current events , while it is below the energy of the neutrino for other types of events .    from particle - physics point of view , the structure in the neutrino spectrum mentioned above may be realized with a new physics at the energy scale higher than @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider such a case in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study whether the decay of a new particle @xmath16 with its mass @xmath17 is responsible for the high - energy neutrino events observed by icecube . for example , if neutrinos are produced by the decay of a particle @xmath16 with @xmath18 in the present universe , a neutrino spectrum with the cutoff at @xmath12 may be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the case where the dark - matter particle plays the role of @xmath16 was considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( for early discussion about related issues , see @xcite . ) on the contrary , even if the mass of @xmath16 is much larger than @xmath12 , there still exists a possibility to produce present cosmic - ray neutrinos with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , if the decay of @xmath16 occurs earlier than the present epoch , the energy of the neutrino produced by the @xmath16 decay is redshifted .    in this letter , we study cosmic - ray neutrinos produced by a long - lived particle @xmath16 . we show that some of the high energy neutrino events observed by icecube can be due to neutrinos produced by the decay of @xmath16 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss that the peak in the cosmic - ray neutrino spectrum may show up at @xmath20 even with the mass of @xmath16 much larger than pev , if the lifetime of @xmath16 is shorter than the present age of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> for such a scenario to work , the decay of @xmath16 is required to occur at @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 being the redshift ) , which implies that the mass of @xmath16 can be as large as @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how the neutrino spectrum depends on the properties of @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> we start our discussion without assuming any particular model for the heavy particle @xmath16 . instead </S>",
    "<S> , we parametrize the properties of @xmath16 with the following three quantities : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mass and the lifetime of @xmath16 , respectively . in addition </S>",

    "<S> ( for our numerical study , we take @xmath34 and @xmath35 . ) because we are interested in electron neutrino , with which the peak in the icecube result may be explained , we assume that the decay of @xmath16 produces a sizable amount of @xmath15 ( after taking account of the effects of neutrino oscillation ) . with the monochromatic distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we will see that the peak in the cosmic - ray neutrino flux can be obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we discuss the flux of the cosmic - ray neutrinos produced by the decay of @xmath16 . in the total flux , there exist two contributions : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are contributions from cosmological distance and from our galaxy , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( the neutrino number density is given by @xmath39 . )    </S>",
    "<S> the flux of high energy neutrinos from the cosmological distance obeys the following boltzmann equation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath42 is the source term : @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the number density of @xmath16 , and @xmath45 is the scattering rate : @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the distribution function of the background ( target ) particle and @xmath48 the total scattering cross section of high energy neutrinos for the processes with the center - of - mass energy @xmath49 . by solving the boltzmann equation , </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino spectrum at the present epoch @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the scale factor and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath54 ,    \\label{d_nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 ( notice that the arguments of @xmath56 are chosen to be the present neutrino energy @xmath57 and the redshift at the time of the neutrino production @xmath22 . ) when the decay process produces monochromatic neutrino , we obtain @xmath58_{1+z(\\bar{t})=\\bar{e}_\\nu / e}.    \\label{phi_nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our analysis , the effects of secondary neutrinos produced by the scattering processes are not included . </S>",
    "<S> this can be justified as far as the damping factor @xmath59 is close to @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , we mostly consider such a case .    in the case of our interest , </S>",
    "<S> important scattering processes of the high energy neutrinos are with background neutrinos , and hence @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the neutrino temperature and is related to the temperature of the background radiation as @xmath63 . here </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the neutrino masses in the distribution function , since , as we will see later , the damping factor becomes effective only for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the scattering rate is given by @xmath66 for the calculation of the damping rate of @xmath67 , @xmath68 is obtained by taking account of the effects of the following processes :    * @xmath69 , * @xmath70 , * @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , * @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , * @xmath76 , with @xmath75 , * @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath78 , with @xmath75 ,    where @xmath79 denotes quarks and leptons , @xmath73 denotes charged leptons , and the subscript `` bg '' is for background neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> ( cross sections for these processes are given in appendix . ) as we will see , for a cosmic - ray neutrino whose present energy is @xmath20 , the damping becomes important only for @xmath80 , for which the typical center - of - mass energy of the scattering process is @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in our calculation of @xmath68 , we neglect the masses of leptons as well as those of first- and second - generation quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the damping factor @xmath56 is insensitive to the behavior of @xmath48 with @xmath82 a few gev .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.55    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : optdepth ] , we plot the damping factor defined in eq .   as a function of the redshift . for the present neutrino energy of @xmath83 , @xmath84 is significantly suppressed for @xmath85 . for example , @xmath86 for @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.95    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phinu_zdep ] , we plot @xmath88 given in eq .   for several values of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> ( hereafter , we concentrate on the flux at present , so we omit @xmath50 from the argument . ) the normalization of the spectrum in fig.[fig : phinu_zdep ] is arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily see a peak in the spectrum ; the position of the peak depends on the initial energy of the neutrino as well as on the lifetime of @xmath16 . if @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( for which the damping factor is negligible ) , the position of the peak is approximately given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 this behavior can easily be understood by using the fact that most of @xmath16 decays at the cosmic time of @xmath93 , and that the energy of the emitted neutrino is redshifted by the factor of @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> one can also see that , compared to the flux for @xmath95 , that for @xmath96 shows a significant suppression for @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the damping factor @xmath98 becomes extremely small for @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the flux for @xmath95 is almost unaffected by the damping . ) for @xmath96 , @xmath100 for @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> for smaller @xmath57 , secondary neutrinos produced by the scattering processes may also contribute and the flux may be affected . however , for such a redshift , the damping factor becomes close to @xmath60 for @xmath102 , so we believe that eq .   </S>",
    "<S> well describes the contribution from cosmological distance in the energy region of our interest . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the case of @xmath103 , the shape of the spectrum for @xmath104 is insensitive to @xmath26 as far as @xmath31 is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> we can also see that the shape of the spectrum for @xmath104 is quite different from that for @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath37 has a sharp edge at @xmath105 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider the contribution from the milky - way galaxy . because the galactic contribution is not isotropic , </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath106 where l.o.s .  </S>",
    "<S> stands for the line - of - sight integral , and @xmath107 denotes the direction of the line - of - sight . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the density of @xmath16 is proportional to that of dark matter : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the density parameters of @xmath16 and dark matter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath111 is the energy density of dark matter in the galaxy ; in our numerical calculation , we adopt the nfw density profile @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the distance from the galactic center , @xmath114 is the local halo density , @xmath115 is the core radius , and @xmath116 is the distance between the galactic center and the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> then , we define @xmath38 as the directional average of @xmath117 : @xmath118    now we are at the position to compare the predicted neutrino spectrum with the icecube result . in our analysis , we particularly pay attention to the fact that icecube has observed two events in the bin of @xmath119 while no event in @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we concentrate on the case where the spectrum of the neutrinos from @xmath16 decay , which is assumed to contain a sizable fraction of @xmath15 , becomes largest at @xmath9 . to make a comparison with the icecube result , we define the `` averaged '' neutrino spectrum for @xmath123 : @xmath124 and similar quantities @xmath125 and @xmath126 from @xmath127 and @xmath38 , respectively . for @xmath89 , @xmath126 is negligibly small . on the contrary , for @xmath104 , @xmath126 becomes more important than @xmath125 ( as far as @xmath128 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath129 , @xmath130 when @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> using the fact that icecube observed 2 events in the bin of @xmath131 within the live time of @xmath132 , we estimate @xmath133 where we assumed that the total energy deposit is ( almost ) equal to the energy of the initial - state neutrino , which is the case of the charged current events of @xmath15 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we used the effective area of @xmath134 @xcite as a reference value , although this value also includes the effects of neutral current . </S>",
    "<S> we take this flux as a canonical value for our study . </S>",
    "<S> we also note here that , with the present setup , high - energy cosmic - ray neutrino events with @xmath135 may also be induced by charged current interactions of neutrinos other than @xmath15 and by neutral current ones . for the excess of the events with @xmath135 </S>",
    "<S> , we may also consider non - monochromatic initial neutrino injection as another possibility @xcite .    as we have mentioned , the neutrino flux is proportional to the yield variable @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath27 which gives @xmath136 . for @xmath89 , </S>",
    "<S> for which @xmath137 is negligible , we choose @xmath25 so that @xmath138 ( which is close to the deposited energies of the most energetic events , i.e. , ernie and bert ) . then , the best - fit value of @xmath27 to realize eq . </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath139 notice that , for @xmath89 , the best - fit value is insensitive to the lifetime of @xmath16 . on the contrary , for @xmath104 , we choose @xmath140 and obtain @xmath141 in the case of @xmath104 , @xmath27 corresponds to the present yield value of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the present mass density of @xmath16 is estimated as @xmath142 . combining this relation with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that dark matter may play the role of @xmath16 if @xmath143 @xcite . on the contrary , scenarios with longer lifetime do not work because of the over - closure of the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.55    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phinuicecube ] , we show the neutrino spectrum for @xmath144 and @xmath145 ; the yield variable is determined so that @xmath146 is equal to @xmath147 given in eq .. we can see that the enhancement of the flux at @xmath20 is possible both for @xmath89 and @xmath104 .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the important check points of the present scenario , in particular for the case of @xmath89 , is the flux at the `` glashow resonance '' @xcite . for @xmath148 , the event rate of icecube for @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced because the center - of - mass energy hits the @xmath149-boson pole @xcite . indeed , the effective area of the icecube experiment for @xmath150 is about 40 times larger than that for @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> one might wonder if the present scenario is consistent with the negative observation of the events for such an energy region because , if @xmath89 , the spectrum is non - vanishing even at @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the flux for @xmath153 is exponentially suppressed because neutrinos with @xmath153 are produced when @xmath154 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the flux at @xmath155 is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath156 . with the position of the peak being fixed as @xmath157 , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath158 becomes smaller for larger value of @xmath156 ; this can be understood from the fact that @xmath159 is proportional to @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the time satisfying @xmath162 ( see eq .  ) . for the case where @xmath16 decays in radiation- and matter - dominated epochs , for example , </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is given by @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , with @xmath165 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) , @xmath158 is given by @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 ) for @xmath95 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> using the fact that icecube has not observed any event at around the glashow resonance , relatively large value of @xmath156 may be preferred . </S>",
    "<S> however , the statistics are still poor , and it is premature to exclude the possibility of small @xmath156 . with more data , icecube may see events at around @xmath150 in particular in the case with small @xmath156 .    here </S>",
    "<S> , let us comment on the possibilities to acquire information about the lifetime of @xmath16 in the present scenario . </S>",
    "<S> because the detailed shape of the spectrum depends on the lifetime , it may be possible to distinguish the cases with @xmath89 and @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see , the spectrum smoothly continues to @xmath176 if @xmath89 . on the contrary , for @xmath104 , </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino flux is dominated by the one originating in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> then , the spectrum is sharply peaked at @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the spectrum of the neutrinos is precisely determined in the future , it will provide important information about the lifetime of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to use the directional information about the high energy neutrinos . in the case of @xmath89 , </S>",
    "<S> high energy neutrinos originate in the decay of @xmath16 at high redshift so that they are isotropic . on the contrary , for the case of @xmath104 , a large fraction of the high energy neutrino events are galactic origin . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the neutrino flux is enhanced for the direction of the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath177 as the angle between the direction of the high - energy neutrino and that of the galactic center , with @xmath178 being the direction of the galactic center . then , we calculate @xmath179 and @xmath180 , which are angular - averaged neutrino fluxes in the regions of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively , for @xmath183 ( see eq .  ) . for @xmath104 , @xmath184 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , significant angular dependence is expected for @xmath104 , while the flux is isotropic for @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental determination of the directional distribution is important to distinguish the scenarios with @xmath89 and @xmath104 .    before closing this letter , </S>",
    "<S> several comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider a possible scenario to produce @xmath16 in the early universe . as we have seen , for @xmath185 , very small value of @xmath27 is required . in particular , if @xmath89 , @xmath186 is necessary , which is much smaller than the typical thermal relic abundance . even if we assume that @xmath16 is in the thermal bath , however , @xmath27 can be significantly suppressed with large entropy production . </S>",
    "<S> a mini inflation after the first inflation ( which is responsible for the density perturbation of the universe ) may be an example . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to introduce a field which has a very small branching ratio into @xmath16 ; if such a field is produced in the early universe , @xmath16 can be produced by its decay .    </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on possible constraints from high energy cosmic rays , in particular , @xmath4-ray . with the mass of @xmath16 as large as @xmath0 , electroweak gauge bosons and charged leptons </S>",
    "<S> are also produced by electroweak jet cascade even if @xmath16 dominantly decays into neutrinos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( if @xmath16 has decay modes into gauge bosons or into charged leptons , they also contribute . ) </S>",
    "<S> if too much @xmath4-ray is generated , the present scenario conflicts with the observations of extragalactic @xmath4-ray . in the present scenario , however , we expect that the flux is small enough by estimating the total amout of energy injection due to the decay of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the productions of electroweak gauge bosons and charged leptons are subdominant compared to the neutrino production , the energy density of radiation ( i.e. , @xmath4-ray ) from @xmath16 should be smaller than @xmath187 ( see eq .  ) . notice that , if the production process of @xmath4-ray is suppressed , the flux becomes smaller ; this is the case for the electroweak jet cascade processes . </S>",
    "<S> for the energy range for which the measurement of the extragalactic @xmath4-ray flux is available ( i.e. , @xmath188 ) , the @xmath4-ray flux in the present scenario is found to be smaller than the observed one ( which is @xmath189 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we believe that the present scenario is not excluded by the current measurements of high energy extragalactic @xmath4-ray flux . with future improvements of the measurements , signals of the decay of @xmath16 may be seen . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed understanding of the signals requires a precise calculation of the spectrum of @xmath4-ray , which is beyond the scope of this letter .    in summary , in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the cosmic - ray neutrinos produced by a long - lived particle @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the pev neutrino events observed by icecube may be due to the neutrinos produced by a heavy particle @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed that such a scenario works even with the mass of @xmath16 much higher than @xmath12 if the lifetime is shorter than the present cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> to make such a scenario viable , we have seen that the decay of @xmath16 should occur at @xmath21 , and that the scale of the new physics responsible for the icecube events can be as large as @xmath190 . </S>",
    "<S> detailed study of the propagation of neutrinos taking into account the effects of the secondary neutrinos is necessary to understand the case with @xmath191 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss particle - physics models which contain a long - lived particle decaying into neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> even assuming that @xmath16 is a neutral scalar particle , one may consider the case where @xmath16 is embedded into @xmath192 triplet ( with the hypercharge of @xmath193 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to introduce @xmath192 doublet boson ( with the hypercharge of @xmath194 ) other than ordinary higgs boson , which couples to lepton doublet and right - handed neutrino @xmath195 . </S>",
    "<S> then , identifying the neutral component of the doublet as @xmath16 , the decay process @xmath196 becomes possible if the neutrino mass is dirac type or the majorana mass of @xmath195 is small enough . </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have considered the case where @xmath16 is neutral . for the case of @xmath89 , however , @xmath16 may be charged ( or even colored ) because the constraints on stable superheavy charged particle ( in particular , those using sea water @xcite ) do not apply . from particle - physics point of view , there exist various beyond - standard - model physics which contain the candidate of @xmath16 , in particular when the scale of the new physics is around @xmath190 . </S>",
    "<S> one example is a fermion in peccei - quinn ( pq ) sector @xcite ( or its supersymmetric partner ) in hadronic axion model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pq ( s)fermion may be stable if it has no mixing with standard - model fermions . with introducing a very small mixing , the pq ( s)fermion decays into standard - model particles with a very long lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> similar argument holds for a messenger ( s)fermion in gauge - mediation supersymmetry breaking model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of those particles may play the role of @xmath16 if they decay into neutrinos at @xmath197 .    </S>",
