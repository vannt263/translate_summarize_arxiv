    "it is widely believed that an elementary particle of mass @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 is described by a field which transforms according to a particular representation of poincar group . in field theory ,",
    "formulated in minkowski space - time , mass can either be introduced by hand or via spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the spin-2 field @xmath2 is supposed to be relevant to gravity as it shares an important property of universality with einstein general relativity(gr ) _ a la weinberg theorem _ and gr can be thought as an interacting theory of @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore natural to first formulate the field theory of @xmath2 in minkowski space - time and then extend the concept to non - linear background .    the first formulation of a linear massive theory of gravity was given by fierz and pauli @xcite with a motivation to write down the consistent relativistic equations for higher spin fields including spin-2 field .",
    "the linear theory of fierz - pauli , however , suffers from van dam , veltman , zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite : in the zero - mass limit , the theory is at finite difference from gr .",
    "the underlying reason of the ( vdvz ) discontinuity is related to the fact the longitudinal degree of freedom of massive graviton does not decouple in the said limit ; it is rather coupled to the source with the strength of the universal coupling at par with the massless mode .",
    "it was pointed out by vainshtein that linear approximation in the neighborhood of a massive source breaks down below certain distance dubbed vainshtein radius and by incorporating non - linearities one could remove the discontinuity @xcite present in the linear theory .",
    "however , the sixth degree of freedom , suppressed in pauli - fierz theory , which is essentially a ghost known as boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost @xcite , becomes alive in the non - linear background .",
    "efforts were then made to find out the non - linear analog of fierz - pauli mass term requiring the ghost to be systematically removed .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite discovered a specific nonlinear extension of massive gravity ( @xmath3 ) that is bd - ghost free in the decoupling limit(see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "subsequently , it was demonstrated @xcite that the hamiltonian constraint is maintained at the non - linear order along with the associated secondary constraint , which implies the absence of the bd ghost .",
    "apart from the field theoretic interests of such a construction , there is a cosmological motivation to study massive gravity .",
    "this formulation provides a new class of ( infra - red ) gravity modification which can give rise to late - time cosmic acceleration and it is therefore not surprising that massive gravity has recently generated enormous interest in cosmology @xcite .    in spite of the the successes of the framework ,",
    "it has challenging problems to be resolved , namely , the model does not admit spatially flat flrw background whereas isotropic and homogeneous cosmological solutions ( @xmath4 ) are perturbatively unstable @xcite .",
    "the latter speaks of some inherent difficulty of @xmath3 .",
    "this led the authors of @xcite to abandon isotropy whereas in ref.@xcite , effort was made to address the problem by making the graviton mass a field dependent quantity through a more radical approach , namely by extending the theory to a varying graviton mass driven by a scalar field @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was followed in @xcite , where the framework of massive gravity was extended by introducing a quasi - dilaton field .",
    "it was pointed that the model could rise to a healthy cosmology in the flrw background .    in this work",
    "we carry out detailed dynamical investigations of cosmological behaviors in the aforementioned quasi - dilaton non - linear massive gravity .",
    "in particular , we perform dynamical analysis relevant to late time cosmic acceleration , and moreover we examine the realization of non - singular bouncing solutions .",
    "finally , we use observational data in order to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ model ] we review the quasi - dilaton non - linear massive gravity and its cosmological implications . in section [ dynamicalbehavior ] , we perform a detailed dynamical analysis and obtain the late - time stable solutions , while in section [ cosmological evolution ] we investigate the universe evolution focusing on bouncing and turnaround solutions . in section [ observations ]",
    "we use observations in order to constrain the model parameters and finally in section [ conclusions ] , we summarize the results of our analysis .",
    "in this section we briefly review the quasi - dilaton non - linear massive gravitational formulation following @xcite . in the first subsection we present the gravitational theory itself , while in the next subsection we examine its cosmological implications in presence of matter and radiation .",
    "let us consider the following action of non - linear massive gravity with dilaton @xmath5 with @xmath6 the usual einstein - hilbert action , @xmath7\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the action corresponding to non - linear massive term , along with the action of a massless dilaton @xmath8 @xmath9    in action ( [ actionmass ] ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are two arbitrary parameters and @xmath12 are specific polynomials of the matrix @xmath13 given by @xmath14 ^ 2-[\\mathcal{k}^2])\\\\ u_3 & = [ \\mathcal{k}]^3 - 3 [ \\mathcal{k } ] [ \\mathcal{k}^2]+2 [ \\mathcal{k}^3]\\\\ u_4 & = [ \\mathcal{k}]^4 - 6 [ \\mathcal{k}]^2 [ \\mathcal{k}^2]+3 [ \\mathcal{k}^2]^2 + 8 [ \\mathcal{k } ] [ \\mathcal{k}^3]-6 [ \\mathcal{k}^4].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ kdef ] ) , @xmath15 ( minkowski metric ) is a fiducial metric , and @xmath16 are the stckelberg scalars introduced to restore general covariance @xcite .",
    "in order to apply the above gravitational theory in cosmological frameworks , we also have to incorporate the matter and radiations sectors .",
    "thus , the total action we consider is as follows @xmath17 in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the standard matter and radiation actions , corresponding to ideal fluids with energy densities @xmath20 , @xmath21 and pressures @xmath22 , @xmath23 respectively . in summary",
    ", we consider a scenario of usual nonlinear massive gravity @xcite coupled with a dilaton field @xmath8 , where the coupling is introduced through ( [ kdef ] ) @xcite .",
    "next , we consider a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric of the form @xmath24 while for the stckelberg scalars we consider the ansatz @xmath25 in this case the actions ( [ actioneh])-([actiondila ] ) become : @xmath26\\\\ \\label{gravitonpart } \\mathcal{s}_{\\rm{mass}}&=3m^2 m_{pl}^2\\int { \\rm d}t a^3\\bigl[n g_1(\\xi)-\\dot f a g_2(\\xi)\\bigr]\\\\ \\mathcal{s}_\\sigma&=\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\int{\\rm d}t~ a^3 \\bigl [ \\frac{\\dot \\sigma^2}{n}\\bigr ] , \\label{actiondilaton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath27\\\\ \\label{g2def } g_2(\\xi ) & = \\xi ( 1-\\xi)\\bigl[1+\\frac{3}{4}\\alpha_3 ( 1-\\xi)+\\alpha_4 ( 1-\\xi)^2\\bigr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being functions of the introduced dilaton - variable @xmath28    variation with respect to @xmath29 gives the constraint equation ( as an essential feature of any model of non - linear massive gravity ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant of integration .",
    "variation with respect to the lapse function @xmath32 and setting @xmath33 at the end , leads to the first friedmann equation @xmath34 where primes in @xmath35 s denote derivatives with respect to their argument @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , variation with respect to @xmath8 provides the dilaton evolution equation @xmath37=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath38    finally , the evolution equations close by considering the continuity equations for matter and radiation , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .    before proceeding to the detailed analysis of the model ,",
    "let us make a few comments .",
    "firstly , as it was first noticed for a similar model in @xcite , the friedmann equation ( [ eq : fried ] ) can exhibit singularities when the denominator goes to zero .",
    "however , as we will show in the next section , these singularities separate the phase space in disconnected branches , that is the universe can not evolve from one to the other .    as a second remark we mention that in the case where @xmath41 , in the constraint equation ( [ eq : constraint ] ) it appears a function of @xmath42 which plays , in the early universe , a role similar to `` dark matter '' or `` dark radiation '' .",
    "in particular , when @xmath43 , in the early universe ( @xmath44 ) relation ( [ eq : xi ] ) gives @xmath45 .",
    "this implies @xmath46 leading the friedmann equation ( [ eq : fried ] ) to be @xmath47 that is an effective dark - matter term appears .",
    "similarly , when @xmath48 we acquire @xmath49 that is we get an effective dark radiation term .    finally , we mention that in the particular case @xmath50 , ( [ eq : constraint ] ) leads to a constant @xmath36 , and the friedmann equation ( [ eq : fried ] ) becomes @xmath51 where @xmath52 are constants .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this relation appears as a particular case of holographic models where the ir cut - off is fixed at the hubble scale .",
    "in fact in the aforementioned theories the number of degrees of freedom in a finite volume should be finite and related to the area of its boundary .",
    "this gives an upper bound on the entropy contained in the visible universe .",
    "following an idea suggested by @xcite where a long distance cut - off is related to a short distance cut - off , in @xcite it was suggested to take the largest distance as the hubble scale or the event horizon .",
    "later these models were dubbed holographic dark energy @xcite .",
    "all these particular cases reveal the richness and the capabilities of the scenario . in what follows",
    "we shall cast the evolution equations in the autonomous form and investigate their implications for late time cosmology .",
    "in this section we perform a dynamical analysis of the scenario at hand , which allows us to bypass the complexities of the equations and obtain information for the late - time , asymptotic , cosmological behavior @xcite .",
    "we mention here that in @xcite the authors investigated the cosmological implications in a specific setting allowing them to obtain simple analytical solutions .",
    "however , in this work we are interested in the full dynamical investigations of evolution equations .      in order to perform a phase - space analysis ,",
    "we first transform the involved cosmological equations into their autonomous form introducing suitable auxiliary variables .",
    "we extract the critical points of the dynamical system under consideration , perturb the system around them and analyze their stability by examining the eigenvalues of the corresponding perturbation matrix .",
    "let us first introduce the density parameters @xmath53 with which we can re - write the friedmann equation ( [ eq : fried ] ) as @xmath54 thus , we can now transform the above cosmological system into its autonomous form , using only the dimensionless variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath36 , while ( [ fr1b ] ) will be used to eliminate @xmath57 . doing so we obtain @xmath58 where the combination @xmath59 can be acquired differentiating the first friedmann equation ( [ eq : fried ] ) as @xmath60}{6-\\omega \\bigl[1 - 4\\frac{g_2}{\\xi g_2'}\\bigr]^2}. \\label{hdoth2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a comment about the role of dilaton in the scenario under consideration is in order .",
    "the dilaton role is twofold , first , it has an effect through its impact on the graviton mass , since in the above equations @xmath0 appears multiplied by a function of @xmath36 , that is of the exponential of the dilaton field .",
    "this is what we call @xmath56 .",
    "secondly , the dilaton has an effect through its kinetic term in ( [ actiondilaton ] ) , which is of course proportional to the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "this is what we call @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , in the present scenario the effective dark energy sector includes both @xmath56 and @xmath62 , since these two contributions can not be distinguished observationally ( we write them separately only for clarity ) .",
    "thus : @xmath63    finally , note that in terms of the auxiliary variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath36 , we can express the physically interesting observables such as the total ( effective ) equation - of - state parameter @xmath64 , the deceleration parameter @xmath65 and the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath66 respectively as @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 where the combination @xmath70 is given by ( [ hdoth2 ] ) .",
    "lastly , in the following for simplicity we focus on the usual cases of standard dust matter @xmath71 and standard radiation @xmath72",
    ".    the critical points of the above autonomous system are extracted setting the left hand sides of equations ( [ eqr])-([eqxi ] ) to zero .",
    "in particular , equation ( [ eqxi ] ) implies that at the critical points @xmath73 , which according to ( [ g2def ] ) gives @xmath74 and @xmath75 in order for the critical points to be physical they have to possess @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and of course @xmath79 .",
    "now , in order for @xmath80 we require @xmath81 while @xmath78 leads to the necessary conditions for @xmath82 s using ( [ xipm ] ) .       in order to incorporate type ia constraints we use the union2.1 data compilation @xcite of 580 data points .",
    "the relevant observable is the distance modulus @xmath83 which is defined as @xmath84 , where @xmath0 and @xmath85 are the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the supernovae , @xmath86 is the luminosity distance @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a nuisance parameter that should be marginalized .",
    "the corresponding @xmath89 writes as @xmath90 ^ 2 } { \\sigma_\\mu(z_i)^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 denotes the observed distance modulus while @xmath92 the theoretical one , and @xmath93 is the uncertainty in the distance modulus .",
    "additionally , @xmath94 denotes any parameter of the specific model at hand .",
    "finally , marginalizing @xmath95 following @xcite we obtain @xmath96 with @xmath97 ^ 2 } { \\sigma_\\mu(z_i)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath98    _ b. baryon acoustic oscillation constraints _ + we use bao data from @xcite , that is of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the decoupling time given by @xmath101 , the co - moving angular - diameter distance @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the dilation scale @xcite .",
