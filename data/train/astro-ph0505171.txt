    "lynds 1498 is a nearby molecular core ( @xmath17 pc ) located in the west - central portion of the taurus molecular cloud ( see cambrsy 1999 ) .",
    "l1498 was classified as a pre - protostellar core by its submillimeter dust emission and lack of an iras detection at 100   ( ward thompson et al .",
    "the relatively weak submillimeter dust emission indicated that l1498 was a low density core .",
    "l1498 has been extensively studied with molecular line observations and using theoretical chemical modeling ( rawlings et al 1992 , taylor et al 1996 ) .",
    "l1498 was initially identified kinematically as a core potentially on the verge of protostellar collapse ( zhou et al .",
    "subsequent molecular line observations have shown dramatic evidence for the freezing of gas phase molecules onto dust grains ( e.g. , h@xmath1co , cs , ccs , c@xmath18o ; wang 1994 ; lemme et al . 1995 ; kuiper , langer , & velusamy 1996 ; willacy , langer , & velusamy 1998 , tafalla et al .",
    "2004 ) ; as a result , many molecular species can not reliably trace the densities in the center of the core .",
    "prominent exceptions are the nitrogen - bearing molecules  and n@xmath1h@xmath2  which resist depletion ( flower , pineau des forts , & walmsley 2005 ) .",
    "even though  and n@xmath1h@xmath2  remain in the gas phase in cold , dense molecular cores , the optical depth , gas temperature , and abundance profile must be reliably determined in order to accurately calculate the density structure of the core .    optically thin dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths is a good tracer of temperature and density since the specific intensity is proportional to the integral of density , opacity , and planck function along a line - of - sight @xmath19 ( adams 1991 , shirley et al .",
    "knowledge of the temperature and density structure is essential to a correct interpretation of chemical and kinematic models of l1498 .",
    "previous dust continuum studies of ppcs used radiative transfer models to constrain the density and temperature structure of the cores ( e.g. evans et al .",

    "the density structures are well characterized by bonner - ebert spheres ( hereafter , be ) : pressure bounded , isothermal solutions to the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium that do not include the effects of magnetic fields or turbulence .",
    "a general picture of the initial stages of low - mass star formation involves the evolution of a be sphere from low central density to high central density , perhaps retarded by magnetic pressure , until a central hydrostatic core develops . if we wish to understand the beginning of this process , we must identify and study low density ppcs .",
    "in this paper we present deep submillimeter maps of l1498 (  2.1 ) with radiative transfer modeling which includes a more sophisticated treatment of the heating of the ppc (  3 ) .",
    "the results of dust continuum modeling are discussed in  4 .",
    "a comparison between the derived properties from dust continuum observations of ppcs that were observed with iso and scuba is discussed in  4.1.2 .",
    "we also present the highest resolution single - dish n@xmath1h@xmath2  and c@xmath5s   maps of l1498 (  2.2 , ",
    "2.3 ) with analysis of variations in the column density , abundance , and velocity (  4.2 ,  4.3 ) .",
    "l1498 was observed simultaneously at 850 and 450   with scuba on the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope during the nights of august 29 and 30 , 1998 .",
    "a total of fifty jiggle maps were made towards the source , each map consisting of four 64-point jiggle maps with 256s of on - source integration time .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 3.55 hours .",
    "previous spectral line maps showed that l1498 is extended in a se to nw direction ; therefore , the chop angle was set to a constant position angle of 20  with a 120  chop throw to chop perpendicular to the major axis of the core . non - azimuthal chopping results in a slight reduction in signal - to - noise in the map since a symmetrical chopping pattern does not lie at constant airmass . a preliminary map made in april",
    ", 1998 showed that the source was detected to the edge of a single 64-point jiggle map field - of - view ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore , the map was extended using three offset 5-pointing maps , each with 30  spacing ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "the five - pointing maps were centered at ( 0,0 ) , ( @xmath2130 , @xmath2230 ) , and ( @xmath2230,@xmath2130 ) from the central coordinates of j@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29  @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "the final maps spans @xmath32  in right ascension and declination .",
    "each map was reduced using the standard surf ( scuba user reduction facility ) reduction routines ( jenness & lightfoot 1997 ) .",
    "each 64-point jiggle map was flat - fielded and corrected for chop throw , extinction , and sky noise .",
    "the 450  images were reduced using a set intensity scale to ensure consistent identification of improper sky noise subtraction .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every hour .",
    "the largest pointing shift was @xmath33 ; therefore , the standard pointing offsets from the five - pointing maps were used to shift and add together the individual maps .",
    "skydips at 850  and 450  were performed every hour during both nights .",
    "these skydips are compared to the opacity measured every 10 minutes at 225 ghz ( @xmath34 ) and 350   from tippers located at the caltech submillimeter observatory .",
    "the @xmath34 data was only available for the night of august 30 . using the relationship derived by archibald et al .",
    "( 2002 ) between @xmath34 and the skydip - determined opacity at 850  ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 , we found excellent agreement between our skydips and the scaled 850  opacity ( figure 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we use the the scaled @xmath34 values to correct for the 850  opacity in individual jiggle maps on the night of august 30 .",
    "we linearly interpolated between 850  skydips for the night of august 29 .",
    "since the sky opacity at 350  and 450  is very sensitive to short term variations in atmospheric precipitable water vapor , we used the tipper opacity at 350  to monitor the variability of @xmath37 between the hourly skydips .",
    "we found an average ratio of @xmath37 skydips to @xmath38 of @xmath39 for both nights .",
    "the 450  opacity was corrected for each jiggle map using the scaled @xmath38 opacity interpolated from the tipper measurements bracketing each jiggle map .",
    "the reduced maps are shown in figure 1 .",
    "l1498 was detected at both wavelengths with a peak signal - to - noise of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the 850 and 450  maps , respectively .",
    "the contours are spaced by @xmath42 for both images .",
    "the submillimeter images are characterized by an amazingly flat intensity plateau .",
    "a 1200  continuum map , smoothed to 20  resolution ( tafalla et al .",
    "2004 ) , is also shown for comparison .",
    "the fwhm intensity contour of the 1200 , 850 , and 450  maps are very similar and well fitted by an ellipse with a major axis ( @xmath43 ) of 197 , minor axis ( @xmath44 ) of 108 , and position angle of 122 .",
    "the 850 and 450  ellipses have similar centroids ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) with an uncertainty of @xmath47  with respect to the pointing center (  2.1.1 )",
    ". the hwhm radius of the core , defined by the geometric mean of the major and minor axes ( @xmath48 ) , is 73 .",
    "while this radius may be used an a representative size of the core , it is important to realize that the fwhm contour is asymmetric with an aspect ratio ( @xmath49 ) of 1.8 .",
    "furthermore , the 1200  and 850  maps are non - axisymmetric with a sharper gradient in the intensity along the northeast edge compared to the southwest edge .    the iso map at 170  is also shown in figure 1b ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "this is the shortest wavelength at which the far - infrared emission has been observed to peak on the core ; iso 90  observations detect a more diffuse emission peak approximately 3  south of the submillimeter centroid .",
    "the scale of the 170  map is @xmath50 , twice the scale in the ( sub)-millimeter maps .",
    "the iso beam was very large ( @xmath51 ) at 170 ; therefore , the map does not show the non - axisymmetric structure observed on smaller scales at 850 and 1200 .",
    "the core is elongated , but with a slightly different position angle on larger scales ( pa @xmath52 ) .",
    "far - infrared emission is detected on very large scales , up to 300  ( 42,000 au ) from the centroid of the submillimeter emission .",
    "azimuthally - averaged , normalized radial profiles of the 850 , 450 , and 1200  maps were calculated .",
    "the images were re - binned to pixels with half beam spacing ( 7  at 850 microns and 3.5  at 450 ) corresponding to the nyquist sampling limit in the map .",
    "the centroid was chosen to be the average of the 850 and 450  centroids ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "the 1200  profile was binned at 10  since the image was smoothed by a 20  gaussian ( tafalla et al .",
    "the flat intensity plateau has the same extent in all of the profiles .",
    "since l1498 is a very elongated core , azimuthally averaged profiles will be weighted towards a flatter intensity profile ( see jrgensen et al .",
    "this effect may be quantified by considering the normalized profile within sectors centered on the major and minor axes . if the sector centered on the major axis is chosen with the opening angle given by , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ratio of the minor to major axes ( @xmath55 ) , then the areas of sectors are equal .",
    "the azimuthally averaged and sector - averaged profile will be modeled separately in  3 .",
    "uranus and afgl618 were observed on august 29 and 30 as flux calibrators and for beam profiles at 850 and 450 .",
    "the total flux of uranus was 74.0 jy at 850  and 195.5 jy at 450 .",
    "the apparent diameter of uranus was 37 effectively making uranus a point source at both wavelengths ( see shirley et al .",
    "2000 for an analysis of uranus finite size on the beam size ) .",
    "the flux of afgl618 was assumed to be @xmath56 jy / beam at 850  and @xmath57 jy / beam at 450  ( scuba secondary calibrator webpage ) . since we are interested in the total flux observed towards l1498 , we calibrated the flux in apertures of 40  and 120 . flux densities are calculated for an aperture diameter , @xmath58 , using @xmath59 , where @xmath60 was the voltage measured at wavelength @xmath61 in an aperture of diameter @xmath58 at airmass @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the calibration factor . the fluxes for l1498 are included in the source properties in table 1 .",
    "the uncertainty on the calibration factor was calculated by propagating the errors using , @xmath64\\ ] ] where  is the flux density ( jy ) , @xmath65 is the calibration factor ( jy / v ) , @xmath66 is the total voltage observed within the aperture ( v ) , and @xmath67 is the area of a pixel included within the aperture .",
    "the scuba beam profiles were determined using observations of uranus at 850 and 450 .",
    "uranus was observable only at the beginning of our observing shift and only at high airmass ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the uranus profile can not be traced beyond 60  at 850  and beyond 50  at 450 . unfortunately , afgl618 is not strong enough to be used for extended beam profiles ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the uranus profiles are very similar to the average uranus beam profile determined from maps made in april , 1998 ( shirley et al . 2000 ) .",
    "since all of our observation were made during the morning observing shift ( 1:30am hst - 9:30am hst ) , the dish should have cooled sufficiently such that the beam shape is stable .",
    "no significant trends were seen in the april 1998 beam maps observed during the morning observing shift ; therefore , we feel justified in using the uranus beam profile for all second shift observations .",
    "the sed was constructed from our scuba observations and a search of the literature ( table 1 ) .",

    "the average beamsize within the array is 178 at 93.17 ghz ( tatematsu et al .",

    "mass for @xmath309 k and @xmath310  is @xmath311  ( spitzer 1978 ) , while the @xmath164  be sphere has a mass of @xmath312   ( bonnor 1956 ) . the be mass is within a factor of 2 of the jeans mass , but @xmath313 .",
    "if we use the @xmath307  be sphere , then the mass is comparable to the jeans mass @xmath314 .",
    "this mass comparison is consistent with l1498 being a core that is marginally stable to gravitational collapse .",
    "while l1498 may be dynamically unevolved , it appears to be chemically evolved .",
    "species such as h@xmath1co , cs , ccs , and c@xmath5s  ( e.g. , willacy et al . 1998 , tafalla et al . 2004 , young et al .",
    "2004 ,  4.3 ) are depleted towards the center of the core .",
    "we can estimate the depletion timescale from the rate equation given in rawlings et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . for a depletion fraction , @xmath315 , the adsorption timescale of a neutral molecular species , @xmath316 ,",
    "is given by , @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the molecular mass in a.m.u .",
    "and @xmath319 is the sticking coefficient ( also see charnley , rodgers , & ehrenfreund 2001 ) .",
    "for example , h@xmath1co  has been observed to be severely depleted towards l1498 over a large spatial extent ( wang 1994 ; young et al .",
    "the adsorption timescale is @xmath320 years for @xmath321 , @xmath322 , and @xmath309 k in the absence of other formation or destruction mechanism . in reality",
    ", many chemical effects may affect this timescale .",
    "two of the first molecules to be depleted are ccs and c@xmath5s .",
    "comparisons with detailed coupled dynamical - chemical models indicate that the ccs becomes depleted on timescales of a few @xmath130 years ( e.g. , li et al .",
    "2002 , aikawa et al .",
    "2003 , lee et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "a chemical age of a few @xmath130 years is consistent with the observed abundance of n@xmath1h@xmath2  ( aikawa et al .",
    "2003 , lee et al .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2  is considered a `` late time '' species since it is primarily destroyed in the gas phase by co and its abundance increases after co is significantly adsorbed ( although dissociative recombination may also be important at low densities , see geppert et al .",
    "detailed chemical models indicate that this abundance increase occurs after @xmath323 years ( e.g. aikawa et al .",
    "clearly , l1498 must be have been in a stable or very slowly evolving configuration for at least @xmath130 years to display the extreme molecular depletion and modest n@xmath1h@xmath2  abundance that is observed .",
    "the dust opacities that best - fitted the l1498 sed were ossenkopf & henning opacities ( 1994 ) for grains that had coagulated for @xmath130 years and accreted ice mantles ( oh5 & oh8 ) .",
    "these opacities have also successfully fit the seds of low - mass embedded protostars ( e.g. , shirley et al .",
    "2002 ) and high - mass embedded protostars ( e.g. , mueller et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the oh opacities are qualitatively consistent with the observed molecular depletion and the chemical timescale for l1498 ; however , the coagulation simulation of oh5 and oh8 assumes a density of n@xmath324  sustained for @xmath130 years ( see ossenkopf 1993 ) .",
    "this density is substantially higher than the density derived from dust continuum models ; therefore , the oh5 and oh8 opacities may not be based on an accurate representation of fluffy aggregation of grains in low density ppcs .",
    "how do you create a dynamically young yet chemically evolved core ? if l1498 is in an unstable equilibrium , it can not have been in that state for a long period of time since the free - fall time for a @xmath8  be sphere , @xmath325 ( spitzer 1978 ) , is approximately @xmath326 years . clearly , l1498 has not yet collapsed and displays chemical differentiation that requires a similar timescale .",
    "l1498 must have been static or slowly collapsing for more than @xmath130 years . while magnetic fields may also play a significant role in cloud support and evolution for dynamically nascent ppcs ( e.g. mouschovias & spitzer 1976 , li et al .",
    "2002 ) , in the case of l1498 , they are not necessary for support of the cloud ( since @xmath327 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can estimate the strength of the b - field required for equipartition of magnetic , gravitational , and kinetic energy .",
    "the strength of this b - field is given by @xmath328 @xmath7 g ( lada et al .",
    "this is a small magnetic field compared with zeeman measurements of the ccs @xmath329 transition which provide a rough estimate of the line - of - sight field strength of @xmath330 @xmath7 g ( levin et al .",
    "if l1498 becomes massive enough to be unstable to gravitational collapse , then the magnetic field appears to be strong enough to support l1498 , in which case , the timescale for collapse is controlled by the ambi - polar diffusion timescale until the core becomes magnetically super - critical .",
    "recent molecular line studies of ppcs in the taurus - auriga molecular cloud have identified cores ( e.g. l1521b and l1521e ) that appear to be dynamically young and chemically young ( hirota et al .",
    "2002 ; tafalla & santiago 2004 ; hirota , maezawa , & yamamoto 2004 ) . the signature of chemical youth is strongly peaked sulfur - bearing carbon chain molecules ( e.g. , ccs and c@xmath5s ) , weak  and n@xmath1h@xmath2  emission , and low molecular depletion of c@xmath18o .",
    "confirmation of the chemical and dynamical youth of these cores requires a detailed comparison between submillimeter dust continuum emission and high - resolution observations of ccs or c@xmath5s .",
    "these objects , along with l1498 , l1512 ( @xmath331 ) , and l1544 ( @xmath332 ) may represent an evolutionary sequence in taurus - auriga where chemical maturity is reached first and then dynamical evolution occurs ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "an important caveat is that our 1d modeling has ignored the observed non - axisymmetry in l1498 .",
    "the dust continuum emission peaks along the north - east ridge and not at the fwhm centroid .",
    "this effect is most pronounced in the 1.2 mm but is also detected at 850 . other ppcs ( e.g. , l1544 and l63 ) also display clear non - axisymmetries .",
    "the spherical be model is limited and unable to describe this structure .",
    "a full 3d radiative transfer modeling is needed to probe the structure of the non - axisymmetry ( e.g. doty et al .",
    "also , since the 90 iso image ( ward - thompson et al . 2002 ) shows a clear gradient across the image , there is evidence that the isrf asymmetrically heats l1498 ( also see langer & willacy 2001 ) .",
    "3d models could explore triaxial , be - like model with a spatially varying isrf compared to fully non - axisymmetric density distributions ( see gonalves , galli , & walmsley 2004 ) .",
    "encouragingly , a comparison between 3d models and 1d models of l1544 indicate that the 1d models are an acceptable fit to the average physical structure ( doty et al .",
    "we have presented deep scuba observations , bears and cso n@xmath1h@xmath2  observations , and gbt c@xmath5s  observations of the pre - protostellar core , lynds 1498 .",
    "radiative transfer modeling of the submillimeter intensity profiles and the complete sed were performed .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "l1498 is characterized by a low density bonnor - ebert sphere with central density of @xmath8  and outer radius greater than @xmath156 au .",
    "the sed is best - fitted with ossenkopf & henning opacities for coagulated grains with thick and thin ice mantles ( oh8 and oh5 opacities ) .",
    "a more realistic treatment of the isrf was used that includes variations in the strength of the incident specific intensity and extinction due to dust grains at the outer radius of the core .",
    "l1498 is a potentially stable ( @xmath313 ) , magnetically sub - critical core that appears to be dynamically young .",
    "these results do not change if the 1.2 mm continuum peak is used for the radial intensity profiles instead of the scuba continuum centroid .",
    "observations of the depletion of species such as c@xmath5s  and h@xmath1co  indicate l1498 is chemically evolved ( t @xmath333 years ) .",
    "the modest n@xmath1h@xmath2  abundance is also consistent with a chemically evolved source .",
    "the best - fitted ossenkopf & henning opacities are consistent with this timescale , although the ossenkopf coagulation models assume a higher density than is observed toward l1498 .",
    "the n@xmath1h@xmath2  and c@xmath5s  linewidth do not vary significantly with radius out to 15,000 au .",
    "the n@xmath1h@xmath2  abundance also does not vary significantly with radius , while the c@xmath5s  abundance indicates significant depletion toward the center of l1498 .",
    "comparisons of l1498 with nearby ppcs that have also been observed at far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths indicate that l1498 is larger than average , less luminous than average , and less massive than average .",
    "the standard evolutionary indicators used for low - mass protostars ,  and , do not correlate for ppcs .",
    "all of the ppcs in this sample are characterized by  @xmath212 k and  @xmath213 .",
    "the temperature and density structure derived from 1d models may now be used in more realistic models of molecular line emission .",
    "future studies of ppcs require high resolution far - infrared observations coupled with 3d radiative transfer modeling of multiple wavelengths .",
    "instruments such as hawc on sofia and the launch of herschel will provide the needed high resolution far - infrared observations .",
    "since every nucleus in the n@xmath1h@xmath2  molecules has non - zero nuclear spin , n@xmath1h@xmath2  has a very rich hyperfine spectrum that can be exploited to probe the physical conditions in star - forming regions . in this appendix , we summarize the hyperfine splitting of the ground state rotational transition of n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "the hyperfine splitting ( in order of importance ) is due to : ( 1 ) an electric quadrupole interaction due to the outer nitrogen ; ( 2 ) an electric quadrupole interaction due to the inner nitrogen ; ( 3 ) a magnetic dipole interaction due to the outer nitrogen ; ( 4 ) a magnetic dipole interaction due to the inner nitrogen ; ( 5 ) a magnetic dipole interaction due to the hydrogen nucleus ; and ( 6 ) spin - spin interactions between the nuclei .",
    "the final two effects are ignored in calculations of hyperfine splitting for astronomical sources since the observed linewidth is @xmath334 km / s ( @xmath335 khz ) and the hyperfine coupling constants are small ( see caselli , myers , & thaddeus 1995 ) .",
    "there are 15 electric dipole allowed transitions for n@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath83 in the @xmath336 basis ( @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 ) .",
    "the 15 transitions are listed in table 5 ; however , since in practice the @xmath341 level is not split , degenerate transitions are collected together into the 7 observed transitions .",
    "we adopt the standard notation from caselli , myers , & thaddeus for the transition labels ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is convenient to calculate the ratio of relative strengths , @xmath247 , of the hyperfine levels for calculations of optical depth and column density (  4.2 ) .",
    "the relative strengths , @xmath342 , are determined using irreducible tensor methods ( gordy & cook 1984 , chapter 15 ) and are defined such that the sum of the relative strength of the electric dipole allowed transitions are equal to one ( see rudolph 1968 ) .",
    "the ratio of relative strengths for the n@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath83 transitions in the @xmath336 basis are given by @xmath343 where the 6-j symbols needed in equation a1 may be found in table 5 of edmonds ( 1974 ) .",
    "the ratios must be summed over the degenerate transitions from the same @xmath344 level ( table 5 ) .",
    "it is necessary to calculate the dependence of @xmath247 on the linewidth for closely spaced hyperfine lines ( see turner 2001 ) .",
    "we have performed this calculation for the n@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath83 transitions assuming each hyperfine component is gaussian , @xmath345 }             { \\sum_{j=1}^7   s_j \\exp \\left ( -4\\ln 2 \\frac{v_j^2}{\\delta v^2 } \\right ) } \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] the results are shown in figure 10 . for sources with @xmath346 km / s , the theoretical hyperfine ratios are sufficient .",
    "this is the case for l1498 .",
    "however , for n@xmath1h@xmath2  observations of sources with broader linewidths , the linewidth - corrected @xmath247 should be used .",
    "we wish to thank the staffs of the nro , jcmt , cso , and gbt for their excellent assistance .",
    "we are very grateful to mario tafalla and derek ward - thompson for providing us 1.2 mm and 170  images of l1498 , to luca dore for providing us his calculation of the n@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath88 hyperfine frequencies , and to antonio crapsi for providing iram 30 m spectra of the n@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath88 transition .",

    "<S> lynds 1498 is a pre - protostellar core ( ppc ) and was one of the initial objects toward which molecular depletion and differentiation was detected . despite the considerable scrutiny of l1498 , there has not been a extensive study of the density and temperature structure as derived from radiative transfer modeling of dust continuum observations . </S>",
    "<S> we present deep scuba observations of l1498 at 850 and 450 , high resolution bears maps of the n@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath3 transition , cso observations of the n@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath4 transition , and gbt observations of the c@xmath5s  @xmath6 transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a comparison of derived properties between l1498 and nearby ppcs that have been observed at far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the l1498 continuum emission is modeled using a one - dimensional radiative transfer code that self - consistently calculates the temperature distribution and calculates the sed and intensity profiles at 850 and 450 @xmath7 m . </S>",
    "<S> we present a more realistic treatment of ppc heating which varies the strength of the isrf , , and includes attenuation of the isrf due to dust grains at the outer radius of the core , . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fitted model consists of a bonner - ebert sphere with a central density of @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 pc , @xmath11 , a@xmath12 mag , and a nearly isothermal temperature profile of @xmath13 k for oh8 opacities . </S>",
    "<S> c@xmath5s  </S>",
    "<S> emission shows a central depletion hole while n@xmath1h@xmath2  emission is centrally peaked . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a mean n@xmath1h@xmath2  abundance of @xmath14 relative to h@xmath1 that is consistent with chemical models for a dynamically young yet chemically evolved source . </S>",
    "<S> the observed depletions of c@xmath5s  and h@xmath1co , the modest n@xmath1h@xmath2  abundance , and a central density that is an order of magnitude lower than other modeled ppcs suggests that l1498 may be a forming ppc . </S>",
    "<S> our derived temperature and density profile will improve modeling of molecular line observations that will explicate the core s kinematical and chemical state . </S>"
