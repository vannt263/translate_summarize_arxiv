    "the launch of the _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _  @xcite has brought considerable advancement to the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the rapid identification of grbs by _ swift _ burst alert telescope  ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , combined with its excellent position resolution , has allowed robotic automated ground based telescopes such as rotse - iii  @xcite , tarot  @xcite , raptor  @xcite , and rem  @xcite to respond promptly to grbs with regularity , often taking images contemporaneously with significant @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "furthermore , the _ swift _ x - ray telescope  ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectrometer provides soft x - ray coverage of the tail of the prompt event and the early afterglow .",
    "combined , these observations provide an unprecedented view into the fireball of the early grb afterglow .",
    "the `` fireball model '' of grb emission ( see @xcite for a review ) has been successful in predicting the gross behavior of the late burst afterglow .",
    "however , there are several inconsistencies between observations and modeling for individual bursts , especially at the earliest times .",
    "most early x - ray afterglows have a portion where the decay is significantly slower than predicted by the fireball model , and this has been interpreted as evidence for long - duration steady energy injection into the forward shock  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the cessation of early energy injection would be expected to produce an achromatic light curve break , which is not generally observed  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although interpretation of x - ray breaks is not always straightforward  @xcite .",
    "observations of individual bursts  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been interpreted in the context of various models .",
    "it is clear that for most early afterglows the `` closure relationships '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which compare the spectral index of the synchrotron emission to the temporal decay index , are often inconsistent with the fireball model for individual bursts .",
    "early optical observations can also provide insight into the nature of the fireball , especially by probing the onset of the afterglow , while the early x - ray emission is often dominated by the tail end of the prompt burst emission .",
    "however , very early optical detections have been difficult to obtain .",
    "the first optical flash observed contemporaneously from a grb was from grb  990123  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 magnitude optical flash was not correlated with the high energy @xmath1-ray emission , and its temporal structure was consistent with reverse shock emission . however , the optical temporal sampling of the light curve was very limited , which made detailed analysis impossible .",
    "other results from optical follow - up to batse bursts have shown that these bright optical flashes are rare , but contemporaneous optical detections of large numbers of bursts have not been possible until the _ swift _ era .",
    "the connection between the prompt optical and @xmath1-ray emission is still not clear . although grb  041219a  @xcite and grb  050820a  @xcite appear to have a correlation between these two components , this has not been seen for other bursts such as grb  050401  @xcite .",
    "@xcite have conducted a census of rotse - iii detections and deep non - detections of prompt optical counterparts , and have not observed a strong correlation between the prompt optical and @xmath1-ray emission for these bursts .",
    "although connecting the high energy @xmath1-ray emission with contemporaneous optical emission can be instructive , this requires a large extrapolation , from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . to study the full transition from the prompt emission of the internal shock to the external forward shock we require more complete wavelength coverage .",
    "the xrt instrument is ideal to help bridge the gap between the optical and @xmath1-ray bands .",
    "the x - ray band is much less affected by galactic and host absorption than uv or optical , yet the soft x - rays provide a useful probe of the local equivalent hydrogen column density .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of the xrt allows monitoring of the high energy afterglow spectrum for tens of thousands of seconds .",
    "however , the early x - ray afterglow often contains flaring activity  @xcite that appear to originate in late internal shocks  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , when it is bright enough to be detected at the early time , the optical emission might be more of a `` clean '' tracer of the external shock  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the robotic optical transient search experiment ( rotse - iii ) array is a worldwide network of 0.45  m robotic , automated telescopes , built for fast ( @xmath6 ) responses to grb triggers from satellites such as _ swift_. with four sites around the globe at siding spring observatory , australia ; mcdonald observatory , texas ; the h.e.s.s .",
    "site , namibia ; and the turkish national observatory , turkey , a rotse - iii telescope is often ready for a rapid response . the rotse - iii network commenced regularly responding to grb triggers from hete - ii  @xcite in 2003  @xcite .",
    "after the launch of _ swift _ in late 2004 , rotse - iii began to respond to a significant number of rapidly and well localized grbs .",
    "for @xmath7 of _ swift _ grb triggers , a rotse - iii telescope is open in good weather and dark skies , and is able to respond in under 1000  s. we thus have a unique set of early grb afterglow light curves that are uniformly sampled .",
    "we note that only a fraction ( @xmath8 ) of the bursts that are observed by rotse - iii are detected  @xcite , and thus rotse - iii is only able to probe the brighter afterglows .",
    "when the broad - band open - filter rotse - iii data are studied in conjunction with early xrt observations , we can gain a deeper understanding of the emission mechanisms of the early afterglow and its onset .",
    "we have taken a complete set of 12 rotse - iii afterglow light curves observed between march 2005 and june 2007 for which we have contemporary xrt data .",
    "these bursts are described in section  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "these are a complete census of rotse - iii optical afterglows in this time period with early ( @xmath9 ) optical observations ; xrt observations within @xmath10 ; and more than three significant optical detections .",
    "these selection criteria excludes a few bursts with only marginal rotse - iii detections .",
    "this collection of bursts have a median response time of @xmath0 after the start of @xmath1-ray emission ( @xmath11 after the gcn notice time ) , providing a unique look at the earliest phases of the optical afterglow . for eight of these bursts ,",
    "the rotse - iii photometry is being reported here for the first time ; for the remainder , the afterglow data have been published previously but have been re - analyzed here .    by studying these early afterglows as a set",
    ", we can discover the commonalities as well as the differences .",
    "specifically , we can determine if the spectral and temporal evolution of these afterglows is consistent with the fireball model and a common emission mechanism .",
    "for example , reverse shock emission has been postulated as the source of the prompt optical flash of grb  990123  @xcite and grb  021004  @xcite , but has not been observed in most early afterglows  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . by comparing the early optical and x - ray emission",
    ", we can also determine if the shallow decay typically observed in x - ray afterglows is consistent with continuous energy injection into the forward shock .",
    "we can also study which afterglow behaviors are part of a continuous distribution , and if any bursts appear to be true outliers .",
    "finally , we can use the unprecedented early optical coverage of many bursts to probe the onset of the afterglow .",
    "this can provide constraints on the bulk lorentz factor of the outflowing material  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in similar vein ,",
    "an analysis of 24 optical afterglows detected within 10 minutes of the burst event was performed on grb detections from the liverpool and faulkes telescopes  @xcite .",
    "they find a wide range of early afterglow behavior , and several afterglows that appear inconsistent with the fireball model .    in section  [ sec : observations ]",

    "this suggests that the optical and x - ray emission originate from different regions at the start of the burst : the x - ray emission is dominated by the internal shock emission which produced the grb itself , and the optical emission is dominated by the onset of the forward external shock .",

    "if this hypothesis were correct , we would expect that ( a ) the decay rate of the contemporaneous optical afterglow is significantly less steep than predicted in the basic fireball model and ( b ) at the cessation of the energy injection episode there will be an achromatic break observed in both optical and x - ray wavelengths .",

    "[ sec : spectra ] , the afterglows that are brighter in optical also tend to be brighter in x - rays . and , as discussed in ",

    "in the fireball model , the afterglow is produced by synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons .",

    "each of these points is addressed in turn .",
    "there are two primary reasons for the optical emission to be underluminous in figure  [ fig : fnuopt_fnux ] .",
    "first , there might be significant extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "for example , this appears to be the case for grb  050401  @xcite ; we discuss the effects of local extinction in more detail below .",
    "second , in the case of x - ray flares or the steep initial decline , the x - ray flux may be dominated by internal shock emission , and thus is not directly related to the optical flux .",
    "this is the most likely explanation for most of the underluminous optical detections in the lower - right corner of the figure .",
    "grb  060729 ( solid upward triangles ) and grb  060904b ( solid downward triangles ) each have very bright x - ray flares , and grb  050525a ( empty squares ) has a shallow flare .",
    "meanwhile , flaring is not observed in the mostly flat contemporaneous optical afterglows . excluding the duration where there are obvious x - ray flares , these afterglows have observations that are consistent with the main locus of points that falls within the range expected from a simple synchrotron spectrum . similarly , other afterglows that appear to be optically underluminous at the earliest times have early x - ray emission dominated by a steep decline ( e.g. grb  051109a , solid diamonds ) or prompt emission ( e.g. grb  060111b , solid squares ) .",
    "these are also consistent with a simple broadband spectrum at later times .",
    "this is another line of evidence that the steep x - ray decay and x - ray flares are caused by internal shock emission , and are not directly related to the external shock as traced by the optical afterglow .",
    "if the early optical light curve were caused by reverse shock emission  @xcite , the optical emission may be _",
    "overluminous_. a reverse shock",
    "is predicted to cause a prompt optical flash , which will significantly outshine the optical forward shock emission until the reverse shock crosses the ejecta shell .",
    "thus , if the contemporaneous x - ray emission traces the forward shock , the optical emission from the reverse shock will be brighter than an extrapolation of the forward shock synchrotron spectrum .",
    "a reverse shock has been hypothesized as the origin of early optical emission for only a few afterglows , notably grb  990123  @xcite .",
    "the primary evidence is the temporal evolution of the optical afterglow , which was consistent with predictions : a fast rise followed by a steep ( @xmath194 ) decay and a break to a shallower decay ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "however , a similar temporal profile has not been observed for the vast majority of bursts detected since grb  990123 , including the 12 bursts described in this paper . in addition , as shown in figure  [ fig : fnuopt_fnux ] , none of the bursts in this paper require a separate optical component in excess of the predictions of the external forward shock .",
    "the implication that reverse shock emission is not common has been noted by other authors  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we now investigate how the broadband spectral characteristics of the prompt optical flash of grb  990123 , detected by rotse - i , compare to the 12 afterglows in this paper .",

    "therefore , an extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum to the optical regime greatly _ underpredicts _ the optical flux  ( see fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "although the broadband spectral index ( @xmath199 ) of the prompt optical flash from grb  990123 does not look quantitatively different from the rotse - iii detected afterglows , in this case the optical emission is significantly in excess of an extrapolation of the x - ray emission .",
    "this extra optical emission component may be reverse shock emission , although other models have been sugested , such as large - angle burst emission  @xcite .",
    "we note that if the early x - ray observations are dominated by prompt emission , and not the forward shock , then this simple broadband spectral analysis might not hold .",
    "this is most likely the case for grb  060111b , where the rapidly fading optical counterpart was detected _",
    "prior _ to the second peak of the @xmath1-ray emission , and for grb  990123 , where the spectrum of the early x - ray emission was consistent with the grb model function measured in the @xmath1-rays .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that none of the optical afterglow detections in this paper , at any time , are significantly brighter than an extrapolation of the x - ray flux using a broadband power - law index @xmath200 .",
    "the afterglows which have multiple observations that intersect the dashed line in figure  [ fig : fnuopt_fnux ] merit particular attention .",

    "although local extinction has been posited as the explanation for the dim afterglow , using the typical milky way ( mw ) dust - to - gas ratio implies 20 - 30 mag of extinction , which results in an unphysically bright optical counterpart  @xcite . using well - measured multi - band observations of optical afterglows , @xcite determined that no single extinction law can plausibly explain the optical afterglow light curves , and some bursts are well explained by a `` gray '' ( flat ) extinction law , rather than a typical local extinction law . in an expanded analysis , @xcite used optical and x - ray afterglows that are in the same synchrotron regime to constrain the extinction law as well as the dust - to - gas ratio for each burst .",

    "three of the afterglows with no excess column density ( grb  050801 , grb  060605 , and grb  070611 ) have evidence for an absence of local optical extinction .",
    "the two afterglows with the largest excess column density ( grb  050401 and grb  051109a ) are consistent with the largest optical extinction .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these chromatic breaks are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the flat portion of the x - ray afterglow is caused by continuous energy injection : when the energy injection stops , we should see a break in all bands simultaneously .",
    "the magnitude of the breaks are also typically not consistent with the passage of @xmath179 , or with a change in density of the circumburst medium . using additional optical data , the study by @xcite documents unexplained chromatic breaks in three of the afterglows reported in this paper : grb  050319 , grb  050401 , and grb  059022c . on the other hand",

    "unfortunately , the rotse - iii telescopes are only able to detect afterglows for a limited duration , and there are orbital gaps inherent in the xrt coverage .",

    "we leave it to future work to integrate the rotse - iii light curves with later optical observations ( as had been done with grb  050319 and grb  050401 ) to better constrain the precise timing of the optical and x - ray breaks .",

    "the remarkably steep decay of grb  061007 with no indication of a late jet break ( or any other break ) has been interpreted as evidence for a strongly collimated jet ,  @xcite .",
    "we note that in our present analysis there is nothing significantly different between these afterglows at the early times except for the absolute value of the decay indices .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a coherent picture of the early afterglow emission , we must ( a ) posit a different emission model for each of these bursts individually , or ( b ) modify the afterglow modeling such that we can accommodate a standard spectral index and a wide range of temporal indices .",
    "we emphasize again that the early optical and x - ray afterglows , after excluding the steep decay phase and x - ray flares , appear to be probing the same emission region .",
    "furthermore , the behavior is roughly consistent with the model for the forward shock .",
    "we have assumed that the x - ray spectral index , which is common among the set of afterglows , is a more robust tracer of the underlying electron index .",
    "the absolute value of optical and x - ray decay indices shows much more variety , and depends much more strongly on the nature of the circumburst environment and posited long - duration energy injection .",
    "due to their rapid response capabilities and sensitivity to typical early afterglows , the rotse - iii telescopes are uniquely suited to measure the optical rise time of the typical grb optical counterpart .",

    "unlike in the case with the power - law fits in the decaying phase of the afterglow ( see   [ sec : plawfits ] ) , we can fit for @xmath207 due to the increased leverage in the rising and fading afterglow .",

    "there is significant structure in the early afterglow , with two sub - peaks at @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "furthermore , the initial optical decline is not quite a power - law , with substructure that is visible due to the relatively high precision photometry made possible by the brightness of the afterglow .",
    "although the model , which traces out the overall shape , suggests that the afterglow has a peak time of @xmath353 , we also consider the two observations with maximum brightness to be valid peaks .",
    "therefore , we have added a systematic error of @xmath354 to the quoted peak time .      under the assumption that the thin shell model approximations are valid",
    ", we can now estimate the initial bulk lorentz factors for the grbs .",
    "these are tabulated in table  [ tab : risetimes ] .",
    "for the bursts where the initial rotse observation was obtained after the afterglow was already fading , we obtain a lower limit in the bulk lorentz factor . for the remaining bursts ,",
    "we see a large range in initial lorentz factors , ranging from relatively slow jets in bursts such as grb  070611 ( @xmath355 ) to highly ultrarelativistic jets in burst such as grb  050401 ( @xmath356 ) .",
    "this latter burst is notable in that it has the largest @xmath314 in the set , combined with one of the most rapid implied optical rise times , after correcting for cosmological time dilation . in combination",
    ", this implies a very fast jet .",
    "we also note that in no case is the initial bulk lorentz factor estimated to be smaller than @xmath355 , which has been estimated as the minimum for which the @xmath1-ray production is possible  @xcite .    at this stage",
    ", it is worth exploring the validity of our assumptions for calculating the initial lorentz factor , especially as it applies to individual bursts .",
    "these include : that the optical afterglow traces the forward external shock ; the validity of the thin shell approximation ; and that we have used the proper start time , @xmath56 .",
    "we first address the assumption that the optical afterglow traces the forward external shock .",
    "as we have shown previously , the broadband early afterglow spectra are all consistent with forward shock emission , with the notable exception of the x - ray flares .",
    "the optical afterglow appears to be less contaminated by prompt ( internal shock ) emission than the x - ray afterglow , and thus is a better tracer of the forward shock .",
    "however , the unfiltered rotse - iii observations can not constrain the color evolution in the early afterglow ; in other afterglows detected by multi - band instruments , this color evolution appears to be modest or absent , consistent with the external shock hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to make any definitive statements about color evolution with our present rotse - iii data set , and therefore we can not rule out the possibility that the early afterglow does not have a significant reverse shock component .",
    "in addition , there are two afterglows , grb  060729 and grb  060904b , for which there appear to be two optical peaks . in each case",
    "there is a short - duration peak contemporaneous with the @xmath1-ray emission , and a smoother peak after the end of the @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to assume the latter optical peak traces the onset of the forward shock .    for the afterglows in which we detect the early rise , we can also check if the power - law index of the rise is consistent with predictions . as the forward shock expands into a homogeneous ism medium , the afterglow",
    "is expected to rise as @xmath357  @xcite .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the onset index of grb  070611 ( @xmath358 ) .",
    "however , the rise of grb  060605 ( @xmath359 ) and grb  060729 ( @xmath360 ) are shallower , and grb  061007 ( @xmath361 ) is significantly steeper . as with the afterglow decay",
    ", we find a large range of temporal indices , with a large scatter around the predicted value . here ,",
    "our conclusions are the same as reported at the end of   [ sec : plawcompare ] .",
    "since the broadband spectra are consistent with the onset of the forward shock , we attribute the large scatter in the temporal decay indices to the current simplicity of our model .",
    "we next address the validity of the thin shell approximation . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : risetimes ] , in all the cases except for grb  060111b and grb  061007 the optical peak comes after the end of significant @xmath1-ray emission as measured by @xmath14 . therefore , for the majority of bursts , and especially those with very short durations ( @xmath362 ) the thin shell approximation should be valid .",
    "grb  061007 requires careful attention . for this burst ,",
    "the optical peak occurs soon after the end of the main @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "thus , the modeling of this afterglow is certainly more complicated , as demonstrated by the structure in the optical light curve near its peak . due to the very smooth evolution of the later afterglow , which is consistent with the forward shock",
    ", we can infer that the broad outline of the optical peak traces the onset of the forward shock , perhaps with additional contribution from prompt emission near the optical peak . for grb  060111b",
    ", we do not have sufficient rotse - iii coverage to fully constrain the light curve evolution .",

    "we have assembled a complete set of 12 rotse - iii afterglow light curves observed between march 2005 and june 2007 with a significant number of early optical observations and simultaneous coverage with xrt . with a median response time of @xmath0 from the start of @xmath1-ray emission",

    ", we wish to determine the `` climate '' of grb afterglows , rather than simply looking at the `` weather '' . in general",
    ", we have a picture where the optical emission traces the forward shock . during the @xmath1-ray emission ,",

    "we have found the afterglows that fade rapidly in the optical also fade rapidly in the x - rays .",
    "the very slowly decaying grb  060729 ( figure  [ fig : combo3 ] ) and the rapidly decaying grb  061007 ( figure  [ fig : combo3 ] ) are very different temporally , yet have very similar spectral features , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fnuopt_fnux ] . in the case of the slowly decaying afterglows , we can posit some form of long - duration energy injection from the central engine to re - energize the blast wave , but this is somewhat ad - hoc , and does not explain the break times  @xcite .",
    "in addition , energy injection can not explain the rapidly decaying afterglows such as grb  061007 and grb  050525a .",
    "@xcite also noted that several afterglows are not consistent with the fireball model , even after accounting for energy injection .",
    "although the absolute value of the decay index is incorrectly predicted by the fireball model , the relative decay indices between the optical and x - rays is roughly consistent with the predictions for a forward shock expanding into a constant density medium .",
    "that is , for most afterglows , the optical decay is slightly shallower than the x - ray decay or is consistent with the same synchrotron regime .",
    "the failure of the fireball model to correctly predict the absolute value of the decay index , in light of the remarkably consistent x - ray and broadband spectra , remains the fundamental limitation of the model .",
    "@xcite have suggested a model in which the x - ray afterglow can be described as a simple combination of a rapidly decaying prompt component and the rise and fall of the forward shock . in broad strokes ,",
    "this is consistent with what we observe for most rotse - iii afterglows .",
    "notably , the x - ray afterglow of grb  060605 ( figure  [ fig : combo2 ] ) appears to a superposition of the tail of the prompt emission and the optical afterglow , which traces the onset of the forward shock .",
    "although this superposition model is able to explain the flat portion of the x - ray afterglow without positing long - duration energy injection , we observe a relatively steep optical and x - ray decay that is significantly more rapid than predicted by using the x - ray spectral index and standard fireball parameters .",
    "conversely , the extraordinarily long - lived shallow decay of the afterglow of grb  060729 also can not be described by this simple superposition model .",
    "thus , for many of the afterglows there remains an inconsistency between the spectral and temporal properties .",
    "in this paper we studied the relation between the early optical and x - ray afterglow , focusing on the onset of the forward shock .",
    "@xcite studied the correlation ( or lack thereof ) between the prompt optical and @xmath1-ray emission for these and other rotse - iii bursts .",
    "they found that there is no obvious correlation between the contemporaneous optical and @xmath1-ray emission at the earliest times . as is the case with the optical and x - ray comparisons in this paper , the vast majority of prompt optical detections and limits are significantly dimmer than an extrapolation of the @xmath1-ray spectrum to the optical regime",
    "however , before the onset of the forward shock , a small subset of prompt optical detections show excess emission .",
    "grb  990123  @xcite , grb  050820a  @xcite , grb  051111  @xcite , grb  061126  @xcite , and the `` naked - eye burst '' grb  080319  @xcite all had optical flashes with flux significantly in excess of an extrapolation of the contemporaneous @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "in some cases ( e.g. , grb  050820a , grb  080319 ) , the optical flux was correlated with the @xmath1-ray flux , and in other cases ( e.g. , grb  990123 ) , they were not correlated .",

    "* ) .    for the 12 rotse - iii bursts presented in this",
    "paper , none of the prompt optical detections are obviously correlated with the prompt @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "for example , optical afterglow of grb  060111b has maximum flux prior to the second @xmath1-ray peak , and does not appear to be correlated . on the other hand ,",
    "the single bright observation of grb  060729 may coincide with one of the @xmath1-ray peaks , but not the other .",
    "this was an exceptionally luminous grb , and the optical emission is significantly dimmer than an extrapolation of the @xmath1-ray spectrum . due to happenstance",
    ", none of the exceptionally bright optical afterglows has been observed by rotse - iii and xrt . instead , the present prompt detections are more akin to grb  061121  @xcite and xrf  071031  @xcite . in the case of grb  061121 , the second @xmath1-ray peak is observed in the x - rays , nuv , and rotse - iii band .",
    "notably , the peak is very blue , and although the peak is prominent in the nuv , it is not significantly observed in the @xmath59 filter .",
    "similarly , the high precision photometry of the late afterglow of xrt  071031 shows that x - ray flares may be visible in the optical , although they are also very blue in color .",
    "thus , the red sensitivity of rotse - iii may make it more difficult to see the contribution from the prompt emission except for the most luminous optical flashes .",
    "after the onset of self - similar evolution in the forward shock , we can use the peak time of the forward shock to estimate the initial bulk lorentz factor of the outflow , @xmath304 . through a broadband spectral analysis",
    "we have shown that the optical afterglow is a relatively clean tracer of the forward external shock , and thus we can use the optical peak time to estimate @xmath304 . for the 12 bursts in this paper , this covers a wide range , from @xmath406 for the low luminosity , late peaking grb  070611 , to @xmath407 for the high luminosity , early peaking grb  050401 . for no bursts",
    "do we estimate @xmath408 , which has been estimated as the minimum for which the creation of a non - thermal grb spectrum is possible  @xcite .",
    "the range of lorentz factors is consistent with that observed in other grbs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although we have shown that the fireball model is inadequate in predicting the absolute value of the temporal indices of the early afterglow , the time of the onset and the implied @xmath304 are both consistent with predictions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ swift _ satellite has opened a new era of grb observations , allowing prompt and early multi - wavelength observations of a large sample of bursts and afterglows . by combining rapid grb observations with the rotse - iii telescope network with xrt coverage , we have been able to peer into the fireball and constrain the initial bulk lorentz factor for a large number of grbs .",
    "although afterglows show common x - ray and broadband spectral properties that are consistent with the predictions of the fireball model , the temporal properties are quite different .",

    "<S> we report on a complete set of early optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) obtained with the rotse - iii telescope network from march 2005 through june 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> this set is comprised of 12 afterglows with early optical and _ swift_/xrt observations , with a median rotse - iii response time of @xmath0 after the start of @xmath1-ray emission ( 8  s after the gcn notice time ) . </S>",
    "<S> these afterglows span four orders of magnitude in optical luminosity , and the contemporaneous x - ray detections allow multi - wavelength spectral analysis . excluding x - ray flares , the broadband synchrotron spectra show that the optical and x - ray emission originate in a common region , consistent with predictions of the external forward shock in the fireball model . however , the fireball model is inadequate to predict the temporal decay indices of the early afterglows , even after accounting for possible long - duration continuous energy injection . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the optical afterglow is a clean tracer of the forward shock , and we use the peak time of the forward shock to estimate the initial bulk lorentz factor of the grb outflow , and find @xmath2 , consistent with expectations . </S>"
