    "single - wall nanotubes ( swnt ) show various useful characteristics as nanoelectronic devices.@xcite they can be either metallic or semiconducting , depending on their chirality . @xcite although a semiconducting swnt can act as a transistor by itself , @xcite we can increase nt device functionality by assembling swnts .",
    "for example , a junction between a metallic swnt and a semiconducting swnt can work as a schottky diode.@xcite the swnts can be connected by covalent bonds @xcite and interlayer interactions.@xcite double - wall nanotubes ( dwnts ) , multi - wall nanotubes ( mwnts ) , and nanotube bundles are all examples of swnts that can be naturally assembled through interlayer interactions .",
    "processing these naturally assembled swnts is one way of constructing higher - order structures for nt devices .",
    "one prototype higher - order structure is the telescoped double wall nanotube ( tdwnt ) , in which the inner tube is partially extracted from a dwnt , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . since the interlayer force is relatively small , the inner tube can be slid and rotated with respect to the outer tube by attached piezoelectric probes with a negligible change in intralayer bonding .",
    "@xcite in this way , we can realize various interlayer configurations in the tdwnt , unlike the case for bulk graphite .",
    "when a bias voltage is applied between the attached probes , the resulting current is significantly influenced by the interlayer configuration because a carrier from one probe must travel an interlayer path to reach the other probe .",
    "this sensitivity can be used in nanomechanical switches and nanodisplacement sensors . in addition , tdwnts enable us to measure the interlayer conductance more directly than un - telescoped dwnts.@xcite    among the reported theoretical work on tdwnts,@xcite , there are controversial results regarding the conductance of a tdwnt composed of ( 10,10 ) and ( 5,5 ) armchair nanotubes . compared to a quantum conductance @xmath6 , the maximum conductance was found to be @xmath7 based on tight binding ( tb ) model calculations , but only @xmath8 based on first - principles calculations.@xcite landauer s formula was used in these calculations , so the conductance in units of @xmath8 equals the sum of the transmission rates . in ref .",

    "the approximate formulas indicated that the disagreement comes from differences in the interlayer hamiltonian .",
