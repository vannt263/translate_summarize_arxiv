    "the violation of the product of the charge conjugation ( c ) and parity ( p ) symmetries , i.e. , cp violation ( cpv ) , is well established in the quark sector of the standard model ( sm ) . at present , there is clear evidence that the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is complex , even if one allows for the presence of new physics in the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath3 mixings . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the complex phase in the ckm matrix may arise from complex yukawa couplings and/or from a relative cp - violating phase in the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of higgs fields . in either case ,",
    "one expects an entirely analogous mechanism to arise in the lepton sector , leading to leptonic cp violation ( lcpv ) .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations provides evidence for nonvanishing neutrino masses and leptonic mixing .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to look for possible manifestations of cp violation in leptonic interactions .",
    "the ideal playground for such a program relies on the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations . at present",
    ", several experiments are being planned to pursue such a task , including long - baseline facilities , superbeams , and neutrino factories .",
    "hopefully , they will be able to measure the strength of cp violation and provide a knowledge of the leptonic mixing comparable to what is presently known about the quark sector .",
    "yet , it is crucial to look for alternative manifestations of cp violation outside neutrino oscillations . in particular",
    ", the effects of majorana - type phases may arise in neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath4 ) processes .",
    "the observation of such processes would establish the majorana nature of neutrinos and , possibly , provide some information on the majorana cp phases . in this review , we discuss the observable effects , which are manifest in the presence of leptonic cp violation .",
    "we present a short review of the neutrino oscillation formalism and summarize the prospects for the discovery of cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "the possibility of extracting information about majorana phases from @xmath4 decay processes is also discussed .",
    "the fact that neutrino masses are so small constitutes one of the most puzzling problems of modern particle physics . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the smallness of neutrino masses can be elegantly explained through the seesaw mechanism , which can be realized in several ways depending on the nature of the heavy states added to the sm particle content .",
    "one of the most popular variants is the one in which the tree - level exchange of heavy neutrino singlets mediates the process of neutrino mass generation .",
    "the mechanism can be equally implemented considering , for instance , heavy scalar or fermion triplets .",
    "we review some of the realizations of the seesaw mechanism and discuss different parametrizations , which are useful when establishing a bridge between low - energy and high - energy cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "this analysis will be relevant for the discussion of the connection between low - energy neutrino physics and leptogenesis , one of the most appealing scenarios for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "after the discovery of neutrino oscillations , several models have been put forward to offer an explanation for the pattern of neutrino masses and leptonic mixing .",
    "future data from several kinds of experiments , ranging from kinematical searches to cosmology , will probably shed some light on the ultimate structure of the neutrino mass and mixing . in this regard , there are still fundamental questions to be answered : are neutrinos dirac or majorana particles ? what is the absolute neutrino mass scale",
    "? how are neutrino masses ordered ?",
    "how large is the 1 - 3 leptonic mixing angle ?",
    "the explanation of the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in nature constitutes one of the greatest challenges for modern particle physics and cosmology .",
    "we have entered a new era marked by outstanding advances in experimental cosmology and an unprecedented precision in measuring several cosmological parameters . in particular , the seven - year data recently collected from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite have placed the observed baryon asymmetry in a rather narrow window .",
    "these measurements have also made it clear that the current state of the universe is very close to a critical density and that the primordial density perturbations that seeded large - scale structure formation in the universe are nearly scale invariant and gaussian , which is consistent with the inflationary paradigm . since any primordial asymmetry",
    "would have been exponentially diluted during inflation , a dynamical mechanism must have been operative after this period , in order to generate the baryon asymmetry that we observe today .",
    "the present review is not aimed at covering all the theoretical ideas on baryogenesis extensively developed over the last few years .",
    "instead , we focus our discussion on the simplest leptogenesis scenarios , putting the emphasis on the role that leptonic cp violation may have played in the origin of matter . after briefly reviewing the simplest seesaw leptogenesis mechanisms , we analyze the possibility of establishing a bridge between leptonic cp violation at high and low energies . as it turns out , there is no model - independent relation between cp violation in leptogenesis and the observable phases of the low - energy leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "such a link can only be established by restricting the number of free parameters in the leptonic flavor sector . from the model - building viewpoint ,",
    "these restrictions are also necessary to fully reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix from low - energy data measured in feasible experiments .    in the analysis of lepton flavor models , a useful approach when addressing",
    "the question of cp violation is the construction of the cp - odd weak basis ( wb ) invariants .",
    "independent of the basis choice and phase convention , any of these quantities should vanish if cp is an exact symmetry of the theory .",
    "thus , in cp - violating theories which contain several phases , invariants constitute a powerful tool to investigate whether a particular model leads to leptonic cp violation at high and/or low energies . in our review , we briefly present such an invariant approach , in an attempt at relating leptogenesis with low - energy leptonic mixing phases . finally , other interesting issues that we address here include the connection of leptogenesis with flavor symmetries and its viability under the hypothesis of minimal lepton flavor violation .",

    "[ sec4.1 ] , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec4.2 ] how high - energy and low - energy cp violation can be related in some specific cases .",
    "we then briefly comment on the relevant cp - odd wb invariants for leptogenesis in sec .  [ sec4.3 ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions and outlook are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "neutrinos are strictly massless in the sm .",
    "no dirac mass can be written since the right - handed neutrino field @xmath6 is not introduced , and no majorana mass term can be generated , either in higher orders of perturbation theory or by nonperturbative effects , due to an exact @xmath5 conservation .",
    "a majorana mass term has the form @xmath7 and violates @xmath5 by two units , so it is forbidden by the exact @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "because of the vanishing of neutrino masses , there is no leptonic mixing or leptonic cp violation in the sm .",
    "any mixing generated in the diagonalization of the charged - lepton masses can be  rotated away \" through a redefinition of the neutrino fields .",
    "therefore , the experimental discovery of neutrino oscillations , pointing to nonvanishing neutrino masses , is a clear indication of physics beyond the sm .",
    "we start by studying leptonic mixing and cp violation in an extension of the sm with neutrino masses generated by new physics which breaks @xmath5 .",
    "our analysis follows an effective theory approach , without relying on any particular mechanism that breaks @xmath5 and gives masses to neutrinos . later on we present several realizations in which the @xmath5-breaking occurs due to the decoupling of heavy states .",
    "we assume that the gauge symmetry breaking has taken place and charged - lepton masses have been generated through the yukawa couplings with the higgs doublet , while majorana neutrino masses arise from some unspecified @xmath5-breaking new physics .",
    "the lagrangian mass terms are @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the sm charged - lepton fields , @xmath10 are the left - handed neutrino fields , and @xmath11 are arbitrary complex matrices , being @xmath12 symmetric .    there is clear evidence in the quark sector that the ckm mixing matrix is complex , even if one allows for the presence of new physics  @xcite .",
    "so , in analogy , we assume the existence of leptonic cp violation arising from complex lepton masses .",
    "the mass matrices of eq .   are written in a weak basis , i.e. , a basis for the lepton fields with real and flavor diagonal charged currents , @xmath13 the lepton mass matrices @xmath14 and @xmath12 encode all information about lepton masses and mixing",
    ". however , there is a redundancy of free parameters in these matrices so that not all of them are physical .",
    "this redundancy stems from the fact that one has the freedom to make a unitary wb transformation , @xmath15 under which all gauge currents remain real and diagonal , but the matrices @xmath14 and @xmath12 transform in the following way : @xmath16    one may also use the freedom to make wb transformations to go to a basis where @xmath17 is real and diagonal . in this basis , one can still make the rephasing @xmath18 with @xmath19 . under this rephasing @xmath20 remains invariant , but @xmath12 transforms as @xmath21 since @xmath22 is an arbitrary complex symmetric matrix it has @xmath23 phases , where @xmath24 denotes the number of generations .",
    "one is still free to rephase eq .   and",
    "further eliminate @xmath24 phases .",
    "one is then left with @xmath25 physically meaningful phases .",
    "it will be shown in the sequel that these phases in general violate cp .",
    "note that the @xmath26 phases appear in a wb , prior to the diagonalization of both @xmath14 and @xmath12 , and the generation of the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "note also that @xmath26 coincides with the number of physical phases appearing in the leptonic mixing .    for three generations , @xmath27 , and",
    "one may use the rephasing of eq .   in order to make , for example , all the diagonal elements of @xmath12 real . for this choice ,",
    "the three cp - violating phases can be identified with @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "it is clear that the individual phases of @xmath31 do not have any physical meaning , since they are not invariant under the rephasing given in eq .  .",
    "one may , however , construct polynomials of @xmath31 which are rephasing invariant  @xcite , such as @xmath32      the lepton mass matrices in eq .",
    "are diagonalized by the unitary transformations @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are unitary matrices ; @xmath20 and @xmath36 are diagonal matrices . in terms of the lepton",
    "mass eigenstates , the charged current becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 is unitary , so it has @xmath40 parameters ; @xmath41 of these parameters can be used to define the @xmath42 rotation , while @xmath24 phases of @xmath39 can be removed through the rephasing of @xmath24 charged - lepton fields .",
    "thus , one is left with @xmath41 phases characterizing cp violation in @xmath39 . as mentioned , this number of phases coincides with the number of physical phases @xmath26 in the neutrino mass matrix , counted in a wb in which the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal and real .    for three generations ,",
    "the @xmath43 matrix @xmath39 is conveniently parametrized by  @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45 denoting the phases associated with the majorana character of neutrinos  @xcite , and the unitary matrix @xmath46 written , as in the case of the ckm quark mixing matrix , in terms of three mixing angles @xmath47 and one phase @xmath48 , @xmath49 hereafter , @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the mixing angles chosen to lie in the first quadrant , and @xmath48 is a dirac - type cp - violating phase .",
    "an alternative parametrization of the mixing matrix @xmath52 , which turns out to be more appropriate for the @xmath53 analysis , is given by @xmath54 in what follows , we also use the simplified notation @xmath55 to denote the matrix elements of @xmath39 .",
    "it is clear that the phase of a particular matrix element of @xmath39 does not have any physical meaning .",
    "this reflects the fact that under a rephasing of the charged - lepton fields @xmath56 the matrix @xmath39 transforms as @xmath57 this is entirely analogous to what one encounters in the quark sector .",
    "the novel feature in leptonic mixing with majorana neutrinos is that one can not rephase majorana neutrino phases since this would not leave invariant the neutrino mass terms .",
    "note that we consider real neutrino masses , which satisfy majorana conditions that do not contain phase factors .",
    "it should also be emphasized that rephasing invariance is a requirement for any physical quantity . in the quark sector ,",
    "the simplest rephasing invariant functions of the ckm matrix elements @xmath58 , apart from the trivial example of moduli , are the rephasing invariant quartets @xmath59 . in the lepton sector with majorana neutrinos ,",
    "the simplest rephasing invariant functions of the pmns matrix elements @xmath60 are the bilinears of the type @xmath61  @xcite , with @xmath62 and no summation over repeated indices",
    ". we then designate  majorana - type \" phases the following quantities : @xmath63 from their definition , one can readily see that in the case of three generations there are six independent majorana - type phases @xmath64 . using unitarity ,",
    "one can then reconstruct the full matrix @xmath39 from these six majorana - type phases  @xcite .      in a sm - like theory with an arbitrary number of generations",
    ", quark mixing is defined through the ckm matrix which is unitary by construction . for three standard generations",
    ", unitarity leads to various relations among the moduli of the ckm matrix and rephasing invariant angles .",
    "these relations provide a crucial test of the sm and its mechanism of mixing and cp violation .",
    "we assume , for the moment , that the pmns matrix @xmath39 is unitary . then one can construct six unitarity triangles from the orthogonality of the rows and columns of @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "these triangles are analogous to the ones used in the quark sector to study various manifestations of cp violation . however , in the case of majorana neutrinos there is an important difference . in the quark sector",
    ", the orientation of the unitarity triangles in the complex plane has no physical meaning , since under rephasing of the quark fields all triangles rotate .",
    "for example , one may choose in the quark sector , without loss of generality , any side of a given triangle to coincide with the real axis .    in the lepton sector with majorana neutrinos",
    "there are two types of unitarity triangles : dirac triangles that correspond to the orthogonality of rows , @xmath65 and majorana triangles that are defined by the orthogonality of columns , @xmath66 it is clear from eq .   that the orientation of dirac triangles has no physical meaning since under the rephasing of the charged - lepton fields these triangles rotate in the complex plane , @xmath67 , in accordance with eq .",
    ". on the contrary",
    ", the orientation of majorana triangles does have physical meaning since these triangles remain invariant under rephasing ( cf .",
    "[ fig21 ] ) .",
    "majorana unitarity triangle @xmath68 .",
    "the arrows indicate the orientation of the triangle , which is determined by the majorana phases and can not be rotated in the complex plane.,width=226 ]    leptonic cp violation with majorana neutrinos has some novel features , when compared to cp violation in the quark sector .",
    "in the latter case , there is cp violation if and only if the imaginary part of a rephasing invariant quartet of the ckm matrix elements does not vanish .",
    "it is an important consequence of the unitarity of the ckm matrix that the imaginary part of all invariant quartets have the same modulus .",
    "the only meaningful phases in the quark sector are the arguments of rephasing invariant quartets . in the lepton sector",
    ", one may have an entirely analogous cp violation from the nonvanishing of the imaginary part of an invariant quartet of @xmath39 . in the limit when @xmath39 is unitary , again the imaginary part of all invariant quartets",
    "have the same modulus .",
    "nevertheless , one may also have majorana - type cp violation associated with the majorana - type phases , identified as arguments of the rephasing invariant bilinears defined in eq .  .",
    "in order to understand some of the special features of leptonic cp violation with majorana neutrinos , it is instructive to study the limit of cp invariance .",
    "this case can be analyzed using the majorana unitarity triangles of eq .  , which provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for cp conservation :    * vanishing of their common area @xmath69 , with @xmath70 standing for any invariant quartet of @xmath39 ( no sum over repeated indices and @xmath71 ) ; * orientation of all majorana triangles along the direction of the real or imaginary axes .",
    "the first requirement eliminates the possibility of dirac - type cp violation while the second condition implies that majorana phases do not violate cp . in order to understand requirement  ( ii )",
    ", we assume that condition  ( i ) is satisfied , i.e. , all triangles collapse . if all majorana triangles @xmath72 collapse along the real axis then @xmath73 in eq .  .",
    "it is obvious that cp is conserved in this case and the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath39 is real .",
    "if one of the triangles @xmath72 collapse along the imaginary axis , this means that the mass eigenstates @xmath74 and @xmath75 have opposite cp parities , but no cp violation is implied .",
    "one can make the triangle @xmath72 , which collapsed in the imaginary axis to collapse in the real axis instead , by multiplying the majorana fields by @xmath76 and rendering the corresponding mass eigenstate negative .      in order to study cp violation in an extension of the sm with majorana masses for left - handed neutrinos , it is convenient to consider the lagrangian after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the relevant part of the lagrangian reads @xmath77    the cp transformation properties of the various fields are dictated by the part of the lagrangian which conserves cp , namely , the gauge interactions .",
    "one should keep in mind that gauge interactions in a wb do not distinguish the different generations of fermions and , consequently , the lagrangian of eq .",
    "conserves cp if and only if there is a cp transformation defined by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are unitary matrices acting in generation space .    often , in the literature , the transformations given in eqs .",
    "are referred to as generalized cp transformation .",
    "this is a misnomer , since the inclusion of the unitary matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 is mandatory for a correct definition the cp transformation , in view of the flavor symmetry of gauge interactions .",
    "the lepton fields @xmath81 and @xmath82 have to transform in the same way due to the presence of the left - handed charged - current interactions .",
    "then , the lagrangian of eq .",
    "conserves cp if and only if the lepton mass matrices @xmath12 and @xmath14 satisfy the following relations : @xmath83    the above cp conditions are wb independent in the sense that if there exist matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 that satisfy eq .   when @xmath12 and @xmath14 are written in a particular wb , they will also exist when the mass matrices are written in another wb",
    ". one can use this wb independence to study the cp restrictions in an appropriate wb .",
    "we perform this analysis in two different basis .",
    "we first consider the basis of real and diagonal charged - lepton mass matrix .",
    "at this stage , @xmath12 is an arbitrary complex symmetric matrix . while keeping @xmath14 diagonal , real , and positive",
    ", one can still make a wb transformation which renders the diagonal elements of @xmath12 real . in this basis , eq .",
    "constrains @xmath79 to be of the form @xmath84 substituting eq .   into eq .",
    ", one concludes that cp invariance constrains the elements of @xmath12 to be either real or purely imaginary .",
    "note , for instance , that the matrix @xmath85 does not lead to cp violation , since eqs .",
    "can be satisfied with @xmath86 .",
    "one could have also suspected that the matrix @xmath12 defined in eq .   would correspond to cp invariance since @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes the rephasing invariants given in eqs .  .",
    "we have seen that the existence of unitary matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 satisfying eqs .   is a necessary and sufficient condition for having cp invariance in the low - energy limit .",

    "the low - energy invariant is sensitive to the dirac - type phase @xmath48 and vanishes for @xmath95 .",

    "it is therefore interesting to find cp - odd invariants which could directly detect this type of cp violation , even in the limit when there is no dirac - type cp violation .",
    "an example of such an invariant is  @xcite @xmath106    the simplest way of verifying that @xmath107 is sensitive to majorana phases is by evaluating it for the particular case of two majorana neutrinos . in this situation , there is only one majorana - type phase and no dirac - type phase",

    "the special feature of the wb invariant of eq .   is the fact that , in general , it does not vanish , even in the limit of exact degeneracy of the three majorana neutrino masses .      in the sm ,",
    "quarks and charged fermions get masses through renormalizable yukawa couplings with the higgs doublet @xmath119 , and their corresponding mass terms break the @xmath120 gauge symmetry as doublets . in contrast , a majorana neutrino mass term , as the one given in eq .  , breaks @xmath120 as a triplet , and therefore it can not be generated in the same way .",
    "this term is most likely to arise from higher dimensional operators , such as the lepton number violating ( @xmath121 ) dimension - five operator @xmath122  @xcite , where @xmath123 is the sm lepton doublet .",

    "if we take for granted that inflation  @xcite took place in the early universe , any primordial cosmological charge asymmetry would have been exponentially wiped out during the inflationary period .",
    "thus , rather than being an initial accidental state , the observed dominance of matter over antimatter should be dynamically generated . in 1967 ,",
    "more than a decade before inflation was put forward and just three years after the discovery of cp violation in the @xmath241 decays , sakharov realized the need for generating the baryon asymmetry through a dynamical mechanism .",
    "three necessary ingredients to create a baryon asymmetry from an initial state with a baryon number equal to zero were formulated in his work  @xcite : ( i ) baryon number violation , ( ii ) c and cp violation , ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the need for b violation is somehow obvious .",
    "if b is conserved by the interactions , and our universe is initially symmetric ( @xmath242 ) , then no baryon production may take place . indeed , since the baryon number commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath243 , i.e. @xmath244=0 $ ] , at any time one has @xmath245\\,dt^\\prime=0 $ ] .",
    "thus , if b is conserved , the present asymmetry can only reflect asymmetric initial conditions . in grand unified theories , quarks and leptons are unified in the same multiplets , thus baryon number violation mediated by gauge bosons and scalars is natural . in the sm ,",
    "however , the baryon number and the lepton flavor numbers ( @xmath246 ) are accidentally conserved , and it is not possible to violate these symmetries at any perturbative level .",
    "nevertheless , due to the chiral anomaly , nonperturbative instanton effects may give rise to processes that violate @xmath247 while conserving @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "although exponentially suppressed at zero temperature , such configurations , often referred to as sphalerons  @xcite , are frequent in the early universe , at temperatures above the electroweak phase transition  @xcite .    the second sakharov condition , namely , the violation of c and cp symmetries , is more subtle .",
    "the baryon number operator , @xmath248 where @xmath249 denotes the quark field of flavor @xmath250 and the colons represent the normal ordering , is c odd and cp odd .",

    "one concludes @xmath259 therefore , a nonzero expectation value @xmath260 requires that the hamiltonian violates c. the same arguments apply to the cp symmetry .",

    "in other words , in thermal equilibrium the rate for a given process that produces an excess of baryons is equal to the rate of its corresponding inverse process , so that no net asymmetry can be generated since the inverse process destroys the baryon excess as fast as the direct process creates it .",
    "departure from thermal equilibrium is very common in the early universe , when interaction rates can not keep up with the expansion rate .",
    "a simple example is provided by the out - of - equilibrium decay of a heavy particle @xmath265 with a mass @xmath266 at time of decay . in this case , the rate of the direct process is of order @xmath253 , while the inverse decay rate is boltzmann suppressed @xmath267 .",

    "this value is nevertheless well below the present experimental lower bound @xmath277  gev  @xcite .",
    "thus , the explanation of the baryon asymmetry observed in our universe requires new physics beyond the sm .    among the several viable baryogenesis scenarios ,",
    "leptogenesis  @xcite is undoubtedly one of the simplest , most attractive , and well - motivated mechanisms .",
    "many aspects of leptogenesis have been widely discussed in the literature and there are excellent reviews on the subject [ see , for instance ,  @xcite ] . in its simplest realization ,",
    "new heavy ( bosonic or fermionic ) particles are introduced in the theory in such a way that the interactions relevant for leptogenesis are simultaneously responsible for the nonvanishing and smallness of the neutrinos masses via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the three sakharov conditions are naturally fulfilled in this framework : the seesaw mechanism requires lepton - number violation and sphalerons partially convert the lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry ; neutrino complex yukawa couplings provide the necessary source of cp violation ; and last , departure from thermal equilibrium is guaranteed by the out - of - equilibrium decays of the new heavy particles .",

    "there is , however , the possibility of generating the required cp asymmetry even for @xmath450 real . in this case ,",
    "additional cp - odd wb invariant conditions are required , since @xmath596 cease to be necessary and sufficient .",
    "a possible choice are the cp - odd wb invariant conditions obtained from @xmath596 through the substitution of @xmath450 by @xmath599 , and which are sensitive to the additional phases appearing in flavored leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "after almost 50 years since its discovery , cp violation is still at the core of particle physics and cosmology . in the quark sector , cpv has been established in both the kaon and @xmath600 meson sectors , and the results obtained so far are compatible with the standard complex ckm mixing picture . with the discovery of neutrino masses , the natural expectation is that cp is also broken in the lepton sector . indeed , in a unified description of fundamental particle physics , it is hard to imagine a scenario with cpv in the quark sector and not in the leptonic one .",
    "the prospects for discovering lcpv in neutrino oscillation experiments mainly depend on the value of the reactor neutrino mixing angle @xmath115 .",
    "the smaller this angle is , the longer we will have to wait until experiments become sensitive to cp violating effects . in the best - case scenario",
    ", cpv could be discovered in the near future by combining the data of reactor neutrino and superbeam experiments ( see sec .  [ sec3.2.4 ] ) , if @xmath115 is not too small .",
    "if this is not the case , then we will probably have to wait for upgraded superbeams , @xmath601 or electron - capture beams , or neutrino factories .",
    "the recent data from the t2k experiment in japan indicate the appearance of @xmath602 from the original @xmath603 neutrino beam with a number of observed @xmath604-like events , which exceed the expected ones .",
    "the probability of explaining the results with @xmath537 is less than @xmath605 and the obtained @xmath606  c.l .",
    "interval for @xmath607 is @xmath608 $ ] , with the numbers in parenthesis referring to the case in which @xmath609 .",
    "such an indication of a nonzero ( and not very small ) value of @xmath115 is a good omen for the prospects of discovering cp violation in the near future . with some luck , a hint for cpv",
    "could be provided by combining the data of superbeam ( no@xmath610a and t2k ) and reactor neutrino experiments ( double chooz , daya bay and reno ) . in any case ,",
    "upgraded superbeams , @xmath601 beams , or neutrino factories will be for sure necessary to confirm such a hint and measure the cp - violating phase @xmath48 .",
    "it has been advocated that @xmath53 decays could , in principle , provide some information about majorana - type cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "although this is true in theory , the task of extracting information about the majorana phases using @xmath53 results is nontrivial .",
    "this holds even in the simplest scenario in which @xmath53 is induced by the exchange of light majorana neutrinos . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3.3 ] , the main difficulty in the majorana phase determination from @xmath53 measurements resides on the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear matrix element determination .",
    "in particular , the precision required to make conclusive statements about majorana cp violation seems to be far from what can be achieved .",
    "the observation of @xmath53 would establish the majorana nature of neutrinos , and therefore would favor some neutrino mass generation mechanisms over others . in the near future , the experimental sensitivity of @xmath53 experiments will cover the region where @xmath609 , covering the ih and qd neutrino spectrum cases .",
    "the combined study of @xmath53 and @xmath601 decay , neutrino oscillations , and also cosmological data , will be crucial to improve the knowledge of neutrino fundamental parameters and test the minimal @xmath53 mechanism .",
    "if neutrino masses are generated at an energy scale not far from the electroweak scale , there is a hope to test the neutrino mass mechanism at high - energy colliders like the lhc .",
    "in such a case , it is straightforward to infer that the presence of cp violation in the neutrino sector would have an impact on the physical processes involving the neutrino mass mediators . in sec .",
    "[ sec3.4 ] and [ sec3.5 ] , we illustrated how the leptonic cp phases affect the rates of several lepton decays in the context of the type ii seesaw mechanism , in which neutrino masses are generated by the tree - level exchange of scalar triplets .",
    "the fact that the effective neutrino mass matrix is linear in the triplet - lepton - lepton couplings , allows one to write in a model - independent way the decay rates in terms of the low - energy neutrino parameters .",
    "in particular , we have seen that some decays are only sensitive to a particular set of cp phases .",
    "therefore the detection of such decays complemented with neutrino data could provide extra information on leptonic cpv .",
    "another important question to be answered by future experiments is whether cp violation in the lepton sector follows the traditional ckm - like form with a unitary lepton mixing matrix . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3.6 ] , deviations from unitarity in leptonic mixing appear in several extensions of the sm .",
    "therefore , the detection of such effects would definitely point towards nonstandard physics .",
    "nonunitarity effects are , in some cases , severely constrained by electroweak processes like radiative and three - body charged - lepton decays or leptonic @xmath611 and @xmath612 decays . in sec .",
    "[ sec3.6 ] , we reviewed the present constraints on the unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix in the context of the simple muv hypothesis . in this framework , deviations from the standard cp violation scenario can be observed in future neutrino oscillation experiments like neutrino factories .",
    "cp violation also plays a crucial role in cosmology , since the dynamical generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe requires that cp is violated .",
    "once the sm is augmented with heavy states which can explain the smallness of neutrino masses , leptogenesis arises as the most natural and appealing mechanism to generate the excess of matter over antimatter . the cp violation present in the decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos , not only gives rise to a leptonic asymmetry but it is also present in the effective neutrino mass matrix determined by the seesaw mechanism .",
    "thus , one would expect that a connection between cp violation at low energies and the one relevant for leptogenesis could be established .",
    "unfortunately , establishing this connection in a model - independent way is not possible . in general ,",
    "assumptions about the flavor structure of the neutrino couplings and/or masses have to be considered in order to make predictions . in sec .  [ sec4 ]",
    ", we showed a few examples in which a bridge between lcpv at low and high energies can be established .",
    "obviously , the ultimate goal would be to test the leptogenesis mechanism at low energies , but this would be only possible if the lepton asymmetry is generated in the decays of particles that could be produced in accelerators . for certain , this will not be the case in a conventional leptogenesis framework in which the decaying seesaw mediators have masses much larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "however , if the origin of lepton - number violation is related to physics within our reach , then there may be a hope to test the leptogenesis mechanism or , at least , get a hint for it .",
    "the answers to many of the open questions discussed in this review depend on the capability of future experiments to explore the unknown . in the neutrino sector",
    ", the milestones achieved in recent years have already excluded many theoretical ideas .",
    "still , there are important questions like the ones concerning leptonic cp violation which are waiting for answers .",
    "we hope to find them just around the corner .",
