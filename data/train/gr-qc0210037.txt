    "research on cosmological spacetimes has been in the realm of general relativity for a long time , establishing the standard cosmological models that are based on homogeneous ( and mostly isotropic ) solutions of einstein s laws of gravity for a continuous fluid .",
    "spatially homogeneous spacetimes are understood to a high degree , and cosmologies based upon them certainly lie in a well  charted terrain .",
    "the difficulties or better challenges arise , if we want to respect the actually present inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "newtonian continuum mechanics appears to be a simpler theory to model the inhomogeneous universe , usually restricted to the matter dominated epoch on subhorizon scales .",
    "indeed , most contemporary efforts for the modelling of inhomogeneities are based on newtonian cosmological models",
    ". there is , however , a drawback : newtonian continuum mechanics of a self  gravitating fluid is not a proper theory _ per se _",
    "@xcite , but has to be setup with suitable boundary conditions ; for the cosmological modelling it is practically restricted to setting up the physical variables relative to a homogeneous background , while the ( inhomogeneous ) deviations thereof have to be subjected to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "even though we may accept periodic boundary conditions as a necessary cornerstone of a newtonian model  hence , we view the universe as a caleidoscope of ever  repeating self  similar boxes that are supposed to supply a ` fair sample '  the introduction of a global reference background is essential to do so .",
    "this may be illustrated as follows .",
    "consider poisson s equation for the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "this potential can not be periodic as a whole ( e.g. for a homogeneous background it grows quadratically with distance from an origin ) .",
    "moreover , solutions of poisson s equation are only unique , if the spatial average of the source vanishes .",
    "both requirements , periodicity and uniqueness , can be accomplished only for fields defined as inhomogeneous deviations from a given reference background , e.g. the standard flrw models ( for details compare @xcite ) .",
    "note that most currently employed models including numerical n  body simulations rest on these assumptions .",
    "these `` forcing conditions '' must be considered a drawback for the following reason : we may consider the spatially averaged variables as replacing the former homogeneous variables , e.g. , the volume  averaged rate of expansion measuring the hubble law on a given averaging scale . this ( effective ) expansion rate does not obey the friedmann equations of the standard cosmological models , but the true equation features an additional source term due to kinematical fluctuations @xcite . as was first pointed out by ellis @xcite , this so  called `` backreaction effect '' is a result of the nonlinearity of the basic system of equations , if general relativity or newtonian theory , lying at the heart of the problem how we could compare and match the flrw standard model of cosmology with an averaged inhomogeneous model @xcite .",
    "it is here , were the restriction of using a newtonian model becomes evident : this extra source term is a full divergence of a vector field and , hence , consistently vanishes on the periodic boundary .",
    "it is , however , _ not _ a full ( three  dimensional ) divergence on non  euclidean spaces ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "hence , although it is commonly agreed that observables like hubble s `` constant '' or the mass density depend on the surveyed volume of space and must be intrinsically scale  dependent , the newtonian models have to introduce a `` largest scale '' where these observables assume a constant value that is determined by the homogeneous standard cosmology and , consequently , by initial conditions given on the largest scale only .",
    "_ by construction _ an averaged newtonian model features the characteristics of the standard homogeneous models . according to what has been said above",
    ", this scale appears artificial and we may not have such a scale where the averaged inhomogeneous model can be identified with or approximated _ for all times _ by the standard model .",
    "in other words , we may not find a global frame comoving with a standard hubble flow and at the same time providing the evolution on average .",
    "as an example we point out that the newtonian curvature parameter is determined by the initial data on the periodicity scale ( e.g. , a flat einstein ",
    "de sitter cosmology remains so during the evolution ) , while in general relativity the averaged scalar curvature is coupled to the backreaction of the inhomogeneities @xcite . since the dynamical evolution of the curvature parameter on scales smaller than the periodicity scale strongly depends on the inhomogeneities ( see @xcite for a quantitative investigation ) , we can expect that a generic averaged cosmology will not keep the global average curvature at this initial value ; it will , like any other variable , change in the coarse of evolution ( for further discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be remarked here that very often the argument is advanced that the backreaction term is negligible , because it is numerically small .",
    "on sufficiently large scales the latter is supported by some of the following investigations : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "still , a small perturbation can ( and as shown in @xcite ) will drive the dynamical system for the averaged fields into another `` basin of attraction '' implying drastic changes of the volume  averaged cosmological parameters _ although _ the backreaction term is numerically small .",
    "this `` kinematical backreaction '' representing , roughly speaking , the influence of fluctuations in the matter fields on the effective ( spatially averaged ) dynamical properties of a spatial region in the universe , does not comprise the whole story .",
    "even if we take the influence of fluctuations on the averaged variables into account , these variables themselves still depend on the bumpy geometry of the inhomogeneous averaging region .",
    "it turns out that this problem is quite subtle and lies at the heart of any interpretation of observables in terms of a cosmological model : observed average characteristics of a surveyed region are , by lack of better standards , taken as averages on a euclidean ( or constant curvature ) space section .",
    "any matter averaging program in relativistic cosmology is not complete unless we also devise a way to interprete the averages on an averaged geometry .",
    "the latter , however , is a tensorial entity for which unique procedures of averaging are not at hand . in the present paper",
    "we especially address this problem and propose a lagrangian smoothing of tensorial variables as opposed to their eulerian averaging .",
    "the present investigation will reveal a further shortcoming of newtonian cosmology : curvature fluctuations turn out to be crucial and may even outperform the effect of kinematical fluctuations quantitatively .    in summary we can state the following headline of our investigation of the averaging problem : since averaged scalar characteristics form an important set of parameters that respectively constrain or are determined by observations , it is a highly relevant task to develop a theoretical framework for averaging and scaling within which the currently collected datasets can be analyzed reliably and free of unphysical model assumptions .",
    "newtonian models are , due to their very architecture , not free of such assumptions . in light of this the modelling of cosmologies has to be lifted back on the stage of general relativity , leaving behind the newtonian `` toy universe models '' , which were helpful to understand basic properties of the formation of structure , but have reached a dead end where the euclidean periodic box is taken for real and every observational data `` fitted '' to its parameters .",
    "fortunately , the structure of the basic equations that govern the averages of observables in general relativity is so close to their newtonian counterparts , that it is evident to better work in the relativistic framework ( compare the formal equivalence of the effective expansion law in newtonian cosmology @xcite with that in general relativity @xcite ) .",
    "the challenge that we shall meet here , and the answer that we shall provide , concerns the interpretation of the average characteristics in a regional survey within a smoothed  out cosmological spacetime .",
    "let us now come to the content of this article and describe our approach before we formalize it .",
    "consider a three  dimensional manifold equipped with a riemannian metric @xmath6 .",
    "on such a hypersurface we may select a simply  connected spatial region and evaluate certain average properties of the physical ( scalar ) variables on that domain such as , e.g. , the volume  averaged density field , or the volume  averaged scalar curvature .",
    "these ( covariant ) average values are functionally dependent on position and the geometry of the chosen domain of averaging .",
    "let us now be more specific and relate the averages to scaling properties of the physical variables .",
    "it is then natural to identify the domain with a geodesic ball centred on a given position , and introduce the spatial scale via the geodesic radius of the ball .",
    "we may consider the variation of this radius and so explore the scaling properties of average characteristics on the whole manifold .",
    "it turns out that this scaling depends on the intrinsic geometry of the hypersurface , and we shall explicitly evaluate this dependence in the neighborhood of the domain of averaging . averaging regionally at every position chosen in the spatial slice at a fixed averaging scale , we arrive at averaged fields that , upon changing the scale , depend on the accidents of the regional geometry .",
    "we may call this point of view eulerian  and everybody would first think of this point of view  in the sense that the spatial manifold is explored _ passively _ by blowing up the geodesic balls covering larger and larger volumes with a larger amount of material mass . on the contrary ,",
    "the key idea of our approach consists in demonstrating that a corresponding _ active _ averaging procedure can be devised which is lagrangian : we hold the ball at a fixed ( lagrangian ) radius , and deform the dynamical variables ( actively ) inside the balls such that the deformation corresponds to the smoothing of the fields .",
    "the ( first ) variation with scale of , e.g. , the density field or the metric is then mirrored by one  parameter families of successively deformed density fields and metrics .",
    "we shall show that this deformation corresponds to a first variation of the metric along the ricci tensor , known as the ricci flow . since this flow has received great attention in the mathematical literature ",
    "major contributions are due to hamilton @xcite , @xcite  we shall so translate the averaging procedure into a well  studied deformation flow , and we shall do it much in the spirit of a renormalization group flow @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . as is common practice in the literature on the ricci flow , we adopt the normalization that this flow is globally volume  preserving .",
    "we prefer the lagrangian point of view also for reasons of the following wider perspective .",
    "suppose that the chosen hypersurface is a member of a given foliation of spacetime and , as an illustration , let the dynamical flow be geodesic .",
    "then , the einstein dynamics of , e.g. , the spatial metric @xmath7 is a first variation ( in proper time @xmath8 ) of the metric in the direction of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "evaluating the dynamical properties on spatial domains ( geodesic balls ) with fixed lagrangian radius amounts to following the motion of the collection of fluid elements inside the ball along their spacetime trajectories , thus keeping the number of fluid elements ( and hence their total mass ) fixed during the evolution .",
    "this program has been carried out for the matter models ` irrotational dust ' , ` irrotational perfect fluid ' and ` scalar field ' in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "complementary to this time  evolution picture ( in the direction of the extrinsic curvature ) , we shall here investigate a dalembertian `` virtual evolution '' ( first variation in the direction of the ricci tensor @xmath11 with variation parameter @xmath12 ) , where also in this case the material mass in the domain of averaging is kept constant .",
    "our headline of forthcoming work is to setup a renormalized effective dynamics that includes spatial and temporal variation simultaneously .",
    "addressing the issue of scaling in the newtonian framework , one thinks of scaling properties of the dependent and independent variables under a transformation of the spatial eulerian coordinates of the form @xmath13 ( and a suitable scaling for the time  variable ) , where @xmath14 is the parameter of the scale transformation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . such a transformation may be used as a dimensional analysis and for the purpose of constructing self  similar solutions of the euler  poisson system of equations . in general relativity",
    "we can not have such a naive rescaling structure .",
    "spacetime is a dynamic entity ; as we shall see , rescaling of the form @xmath15 must be replaced by a point ",
    "dependent functional rescaling , otherwise the scaled fields are strictly equivalent to the original fields .    in order to characterize the correct conceptual framework for addressing averaging and scaling properties in relativistic cosmology , let us first remark that in general relativity we basically have one scaling variable related to the unit of distance : we can express the unit of time in terms of the unit of distance using the speed of light .",
    "similarly , we can express the unit of mass through the unit of distance using newton s gravitational constant .",
    "this remark implies that the scaling properties of einstein s equations typically generate a mapping between distinct initial data sets , ( in this sense we are basically dealing with a spatial renormalization group transformation ) .",
    "as we shall see below in detail , a rigorous characterization of an averaging procedure in relativistic cosmology is indeed strictly connected to the scaling geometry of the initial data set for einstein s equations .",
    "an admissible set of initial data is propagated along the time  like vector field @xmath16 , with the lapse function @xmath17 scaling the unit normal @xmath18 at the given point and the shift vector field @xmath19 .",
    "the spacetime geometry is foliated into hypersurfaces @xmath20 , @xmath21 , on which we study scaling properties of the initial data set .",
    ", width=264 ]    thus , it seems appropriate to recall some of the properties of the arnowitt ",
    "misner formulation of einstein s equations .",

    "consider , in such a setting , the dynamics of a self  gravitating distribution of matter .",
    "in the adm formulation , the dynamics of such a distribution and the corresponding spacetime geometry @xmath32 are described by the evolution of an initial data set : @xmath33 where the riemannian metric @xmath7 and the triple of tensor fields @xmath34 ; we adopt the summation convention .",

    "both encode the deviations of the scalar curvature from a constant curvature model , e.g. , a flrw space section .",
    "we are now going to relate our findings to suitable _ cosmological parameters _ by moving to a notation that is familiar to cosmology and accessible to the interpretation of observations .",
    "in standard cosmology we are used to discuss cosmological parameters that are defined on the basis of a homogeneous  isotropic solution of einstein s or newton s equations for a self  gravitating distribution of matter .",
    "a refinement of the standard model has been suggested recently ( @xcite in newtonian cosmology , and @xcite , @xcite in general relativity ) , where the ( global ) homogeneous values of the relevant variables were replaced by their ( regional ) spatial volume  averages . for example , an averaged dust matter model in relativistic cosmology was found to obey a set of _ generalized friedmann equations _",
    "@xcite , from which we only need the averaged hamiltonian constraint here ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath525 where we have defined , on the averaging domain @xmath526 , the _ regional hubble parameter _ as @xmath527 of the spatially averaged rate of expansion @xmath528 : @xmath529 this form of the volume  averaged hamiltonian constraint has the merit to isolate an explicit source term ( the _ kinematical backreaction _ ) , which quantifies the deviations of the average model from the standard flrw model equation .",
    "it is composed of positive  definite fluctuation terms @xcite : @xmath530 here , @xmath531 and @xmath532 denote two of the three principal scalar invariants of the extrinsic curvature ; the latter equality features the corresponding kinematical invariants expansion rate @xmath533 , and rate of shear @xmath534 ( for irrotational flows ) .",
    "in contrast to the standard flrw cosmological parameters there are four players .",
    "in the former there is by definition no kinematical backreaction , @xmath535 .    _ regional cosmological parameters _",
    "furthermore , in the general model , we may define _ regional cosmological parameters _ as the following ( scale  dependent ) functionals @xcite : @xmath536 and , in addition to the standard parameters ( [ standardparameters ] ) , @xmath537 these `` parameters '' obey by construction : @xmath538 and they would all become @xmath231dependent functions under the smoothing flow .",
    "( [ omegaconstraint ] ) furnishes a way of writing the volume ",
    "averaged hamiltonian constraint that is best accessible to observational interpretations .    however , unlike in newtonian cosmology , where the corresponding equations have ( apart from the definitions of the curvature and backreaction parameters ) a similar form , it is not straightforward to compare the above relativistic average model parameters to observational parameters .",
    "the reason is that the volume ",
    "averages contain information on the actually present inhomogeneities in the geometry within the averaging domain .",
    "in contrast , the `` observer s universe '' is a euclidean or constant curvature model .",
    "consequently , the interpretation of observations within the set of the standard model parameters neglects the geometrical inhomogeneities that ( through the riemannian volume ",
    "average ) are hidden in the average parameters of the realistic cosmology .",
    "notwithstanding , we are now in position to relate the parameters interpreted within the standard model to the actual parameters by studying the smoothed cosmological model furnished by eq .",
    "( [ altra ] ) , which can be written in terms of the effective quantities @xmath539 , @xmath540 , and @xmath541 as follows : @xmath542 where we have defined the residual kinematical backreaction ( after smoothing ) by : @xmath543 thus , a `` friedmannian bias '' in modelling the real ( observed ) region of the universe with a smooth matter distribution evolving in a homogeneous and isotropic geometry , inevitably ` dresses ' the matter density @xmath544 , the hubble parameter @xmath539 , and the curvature @xmath541 with correction factors , even if the kinematical backreaction effect is respected .",
    "( note that the latter is expected on a regional domain due to cosmic variance of the variables ; see our discussion below ) .",
    "correspondingly , an observer with a `` friedmannian bias '' would interprete his measurements in terms of the ` dressed ' cosmological parameters : @xmath545 which again , by construction , obey : @xmath546    our subsequent analysis will be focussed on discussing the actual relevance of the geometrical correction terms .    _",
    "the relation between ` bare ' and ` dressed ' cosmological parameters _    following from our previous analysis , especially of the expansion and curvature fluctuations , we can collect the formulae in order to relate the ` bare ' and ` dressed ' cosmological parameters .    defining the fraction between the volume of the smoothed constant curvature region and the volume of the original bumby region , as well as the fraction of the corresponding hubble parameters , by @xmath547 we can formally write : @xmath548 where in the last equation for the fraction of the curvature parameters we introduced the dimensionless _",
    "regional curvature backreaction parameter _ @xmath549 .",
    "this set of equations furnishes a formal basis within which the results of this paper can be interpreted with respect to their relevance for observational cosmology . in the following discussion we comment on possible strategies for a quantitative analysis of the results .",
    "the above listed relations appear to provide a formal recipee to apply the results of this paper .",
    "however , it is clear that a quantitative estimate of the relations between ` bare ' and ` dressed ' cosmological parameters must be based on dynamical models and can not follow solely from geometrical consequences of the smoothing procedure on a given spatial hypersurface .",
    "dynamical estimates can be subtle in a relativistic setting , since realistic models for the evolution of structure are well  implemented only in the newtonian framework .",
    "recently , progress has been made in estimating the _ kinematical backreaction _",
    "parameter @xmath550 in newtonian cosmology .",
    "putting the key  results obtained by a realistic newtonian model for the evolution of structures into perspective ( @xcite , @xcite ) , it was found that , e.g. , on a sufficiently large expanding region ( of the order of several hundreds of megaparsecs ) , the kinematical backreaction parameter is quantitatively small , which is in conformity with other ( including relativistic ) estimates ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the surprising result , however , was that backreaction can have a large influence on the other ( standard ) cosmological parameters during the dynamical evolution .",
    "although the newtonian model requires that the backreaction vanishes on the global boundary , we may argue in the context of the present work that , on a given space section at a fixed time of observation , the kinematical backreaction is quantitatively less important than the standard parameters , and reflects _ cosmic variance _ of the measured variables , the presence of which is expected on a regional domain of the universe .",
    "especially the work @xcite has clearly shown , however , that the values of these parameters are not related to their initial values evolved by a flrw cosmology .    according to our analysis of the effect of smoothing , we found that a similar term can be identified : the _ curvature backreaction _ , which we expect to play an analogous role as the kinematical backreaction . in line of these thoughts",
    "we therefore suggest to concentrate further quantitative investigations on the following , albeit at this level formal , considerations .",
    "observe that together with the two generalized friedmann equations in the form ( [ omegaconstraint ] ) and ( [ omegaconstraintdressed ] ) for the average ( ` bare ' ) observables in the real manifold , and for the ` dressed ' observables in the smooth constant curvature model , @xmath551 we may consider fractions of various cosmological parameters in order to eliminate , say the fraction of the hubble parameters @xmath552 , and conclude on the values of the others . our goal is to relate observationally determined values of the ` dressed ' parameters ( i.e. , as interpreted with a `` friedmannian bias '' ) to the actual parameters of the average cosmological model .",
    "according to the above discussion of the effect of the kinematical backreaction , we are encouraged to consider a subcase in which the backreaction parameters are quantitatively negligible .",
    "( this is , e.g. , also true when the positive  definite fluctuation terms compensate each other : for the kinematical backreaction we would consider the compensation of shear fluctuations and expansion fluctuations ; for the curvature backreaction we would think of a compensation of fluctuations of metrical anisotropies with curvature amplitude fluctuations . )",
    "it should be emphasized that the following is an illustration and does not replace the necessity of a fully dynamical investigation . approximating",
    "the ` bare ' and ` dressed ' kinematical backreaction parameters by zero , we have : @xmath553 let us furthermore consider a region of the universe on scales of the order of @xmath554 gpc , where ( also in the same spirit possibly biassed ) observations of the first doppler peak in the cmb fluctuations at the `` friedmannian scale '' @xmath555mpc / h favour an approximately vanishing average curvature @xmath556 . if , again for simplicity , we approximate also the curvature backreaction parameter by zero , @xmath557 , in the sense that there are curvature fluctuations present , but the two positive  definite parts in the backreaction term compensate each other , we would have an approximately vanishing average curvature also in the actual cosmological model . then , the standard argument requires compensation of the actually observed matter content ( including dark baryonic and possibly dark nonbaryonic matter components ) , obeying the commonly agreed upper bound @xmath558 with a cosmological term @xmath559 . for the ` bare ' parameters we then obtain @xmath560 , which yields the estimate :",
    "@xmath561 this ( certainly oversimplified ) example shows that , instead of postulating the presence of a large cosmological term , the ` bare ' mass parameter could still acquire values close to one , if ` undressed ' , and if the volume fraction @xmath562 is substantially greater than 1 . the second relation in eq .",
    "( [ cosmologicalfractions ] ) then shows , that the actual hubble ",
    "parameter would be larger than the ` dressed ' hubble parameter .",
    "the estimation of @xmath562 itself is intimately connected with the estimation of curvature fluctuations , and a quantitative ( scale  dependent ) statement about this effect is beyond the scope of this paper : it requires dynamical considerations .",
    "a quantitative estimate that gives us an idea of the order of magnitude of such an effect has been worked out by hellaby @xcite . using spherically symmetric solutions he compares , on some spatial scale , the volume of a flrw space section with that given by a lematre  tolman ",
    "bondi solution ( see also the alternative comparison of volumes suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to our approach ( that compares the two models at equal material mass ) , hellaby uses `` volume matching '' as proposed by ellis and stoeger @xcite ( requiring the volumes to be equal ) .",
    "however , we expect the estimated effect to be of the same order which , for two realistic density profiles of a typical cluster of galaxies ( an over  density ) and a typical ` void ' ( an under  density ) , yields errors in the range @xmath563 % for these single objects , if , e.g. , the spatial averages of the density profiles are compared with the corresponding ( fitted ) flrw parameters",
