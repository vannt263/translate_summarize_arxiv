    "the investigation of collective phenomena in pair plasmas , consisting of two species with the same mass is gaining interest among the plasma physics community .",
    "there are several reasons for that : the first one is that electron - positron pair plasmas are present in many astrophysical contexts , such as the early universe , neutron stars and active galactic nuclei . on the other hand , recent experiments with fullerene pair plasmas @xcite have allowed the investigators to observe collective phenomena in the laboratory , something that was earlier impeded by the short annihilation times of electron - positron laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "but another explanation for the outstanding interest in pair plasmas is their relatively simple theoretical description , which makes them a particularly good subject of investigations for questions in fundamental plasma theory .",
    "this property of pair plasmas has been emphasized in earlier works that investigated the nonlinear instability and saturation of current - carrying plasmas @xcite . in these works",
    ", use was made of the equality of time - scales in the dynamics of both species to accelerate the onset and evolution of instability in a linearly stable regime .",
    "it was also found that , after a turbulent transient stage , the system reached a stable state in which phase - space structures were present coexisting with distribution functions one of which being characterized by a flat trapped particle distribution . kinetic structures in pair plasmas were on the other hand investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , two works on which the present article relies .",
    "however , in the first , analytical one the investigations were limited to small amplitude waves and a complete symmetry in the parameters describing the distribution functions of both species whereas in the second , numerical one only solitary phase - space holes were considered .",
    "both works did not consider current - carrying plasmas .",
    "it is thus appropiate to remove these restrictions in order to arrive at a more general theory of electrostatic trapping in pair plasmas , which is the purpose of the present article .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ theory ]",
    "we provide a theoretical background about the governing equations and the procedure to obtain finite amplitude equilibrium solutions .",
    "sections [ dl ] , [ holes ] and [ periodic ] are dedicated , respectively , to the study of double layers , phase - space holes and periodic solutions .",
    "finally , the results and conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "we consider a drifting collisionless pair plasma with equal temperatures for both particle species .",

    "@xcite . to find acceptable , physical solutions two conditions have to be imposed upon @xmath41 : a ) @xmath50 if @xmath51 and b ) @xmath52 .",
    "the second condition is usually referred to as the nonlinear dispersion relation ( ndr ) , as it links the amplitude of the structure to its phase speed .",
    "now we make use of the expressions presented in the previous section to obtain equilibrium solutions of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "first , we look for double layer ( dl ) solutions .",
    "double layers are configurations of phase - space which are associated with a monotonic step - like potentials @xcite .    in order to have a dl",
    ", the densities of both species must be equal as @xmath53 , which means @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "let us assume that the densities are unity at @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that @xmath57 and @xmath58 . under this assumption",
    ", the condition @xmath59 reduces to @xmath60 this equation has to be solved simultaneously with the ndr for the unknowns @xmath61 and @xmath30 in order to obtain valid solutions .      .",
    "note that for both cases two branches exist , called symmetric and asymmetric branches .",
    "note also that there are no asymmetric solutions in the propagating case if @xmath62 .",
    "[ dlnodrift ] ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of dls in pair plasmas was discussed .",
    "they were limited , however , to the small amplitude limit and with the further assumption of complete symmetry between positive and negative particles ( @xmath63 ) . here",
    "we show that , even if we drop such limitations , we can still find dl solutions .",
    "their existence curves are plotted in fig .",
    "[ dlnodrift ] .",
    "note that there are two different branches , labelled `` symmetric '' and `` asymmetric '' .",
    "the symmetric branch represents solutions for which @xmath63 .",
    "it exists only for @xmath64 and admits dls of arbitrary strength . in the limit @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) it corresponds to the solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite , which , for @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 . for finite amplitudes",
    "we observe that the relationship between the defining parameters is very well approximated by an expression of the form @xmath69 , where for standing dls ( @xmath67 ) we found @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "this implies that the dl becomes the stronger the more flat both trapped particle distributions are .",
    "the asymmetric branch , on the other side , represents solutions for which the complete symmetry between the species is broken .",
    "this branch contains also solutions for which @xmath72 . in the special case @xmath73 ,",
    "the distribution function of positive particles is flat in the trapped range while trapped negative particles form a dip .",
    "the most relevant physical difference between both branches is that , while solutions in the symmetric branch do not present a jump in the densities , this is not true for asymmetric solutions .      .",
    "the solid line represents standing dls while the dashed one stands for propagating dl with a phase speed @xmath74 .",
    "note that for both cases two branches exist , which are the degenerated form of the symmetric and asymmetric branches in the case @xmath75 .",
    "note also that the curves for @xmath76 , @xmath77 are equivalent to that of @xmath75 , @xmath78 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ dlnodrift ] ( see text ) .",
    "[ dldrift ] ]    the picture is changed when we look for double layers in a current - carrying plasma , a case which was not discussed in ref .",
    "the parameter curves representing possible solutions for @xmath79 are shown in fig .",
    "[ dldrift ] .",
    "first of all we note that the expressions for @xmath80 and @xmath81 do only depend on @xmath82 .",
    "therefore we can make a complete correspondence between standing structures in a current - carrying plasma ( @xmath83 ) and propagating structures in a non - current - carrying plasma ( @xmath84 ) just by interchanging @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this explains that the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ dldrift ] are the same as the dashed ones in fig .",
    "[ dlnodrift ] .",
    "note however that , although the location of solutions in parameter space are exactly the same , both represent very different kinds of solutions .",
    "nevertheless , if we look for propagating structures in current - carrying plasmas , the symmetry is broken and the correspondence is no longer valid .",
    "an example of the location in parameter space of propagating dls is given by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ dldrift ] .",
    "note that we still have two different branches but now , as @xmath87 imposes a further asymmetry , we do not have a family of solutions with @xmath63 .",
    "we can still call the two branches of solutions `` degenerated symmetric branch '' and `` degenerated asymmetric branch '' .",
    "the degenerated symmetric branch exists only for @xmath64 and requires increasing amplitudes as @xmath88 .",
    "here we find also a power law of the form @xmath89 where for @xmath79 , @xmath90 we obtain @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "as a function of the trapping parameter @xmath26 for different phase velocities .",
    "the drift between both species was @xmath79 and a flat trapped range is assumed in @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "[ ehdrift ] ]    the existence and properties of solitary holes in non - drifting pair plasmas was already studied in ref .",
    "therefore here we focus on the existence of solitary holes in current - carrying pair plasmas .",
    "as the symmetry arguments mentioned in the past section hold for holes as well as for dls , standing holes in a current - carrying plasma correspond one - to - one to propagating holes in a plasma with @xmath75 .    without loss of generality",
    ", we will consider here holes in @xmath95 , corresponding to bell - like electrostatic potentials , i.e. @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "we will also consider only the case of a flat trapped range in @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "there are several reasons to give special attention to these cases : a ) there are large numerical evidences that such configurations are more stable and therefore potential attractors of the dynamics . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the evolution of two colliding holes was simulated which resulted in a partially flat distribution function , and b ) recent simulations of nonlinear instability @xcite and the subsequent turbulence in current - carrying pair plasmas show that this turbulence decays towards a stable hole equilibrium in which one of the species presents a flat distribution in the resonant range .    in fig .",
    "[ ehdrift ] we present the curves in the @xmath26 , @xmath30 parameter space where solitary hole solutions exist in a plasma with @xmath79 for different values of the phase velocity @xmath98 .",
    "no solutions are possible with @xmath99 .",
    "note that even for large amplitudes , the curves can be approximated by a power law of the form @xmath100 , which is actually exact for small amplitudes .",
    "periodic structures can also appear in pair plasmas .",
    "this is important because they are excited in experiments such as ref .",
    "@xcite is usually periodical and also because most numerical codes impose periodic boundary conditions in space , giving preference to periodic structures .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a dispersion relation was found for harmonic waves that smoothly joined the limits of slow acoustic modes @xmath101 and plasma waves @xmath102 . to understand how the finite amplitude of the potential affects these results , we will use @xmath103 , which for small amplitudes gives raise to harmonic waves ( @xmath104 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ disprel ] shows the dispersion relation of these waves with different values of the amplitude of the electrostatic potential .",
    "there we notice that for large amplitude waves the minimum phase velocity , corresponding to the slow acoustic mode , is considerably smaller than the one corresponding to very small amplitudes ( @xmath105 when @xmath106 ) .",
    "this slowing effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ vpsi ] , where the velocity of the slow acoustic mode is plotted as a function of the amplitude of the electrostatic potential .     and several amplitudes of the electrostatic potential .",
    "the dashed curve represents the limit @xmath106 , as analytically found in ref .",
    "[ disprel ] ]    ]",
    "in this paper we investigated the existence of electrostatic structures in pair plasmas with a drift between the species due e.g. to an external electric field .",
    "this results extend and complement those of refs.@xcite and @xcite in several aspects : we do not restrict ourselves to the case of perfect symmetry between the species ( @xmath107 ) , we do not base the results in the small amplitude limit ( @xmath106 ) and , finally we do not consider only plasmas without a drift velocity between the species ( @xmath108 ) . by removing those limitations we have explored a wide range of possible structures .",
    "we have focused on some remarkable results that may help to interprete future experimental and numerical data .    as relevant outcome",
    ", we emphasize the existence of asymmetric double layers , that exhibit a jump in the densities , as well as the dependence between the velocity of the slow acoustic mode and the potential amplitude for periodic waves .",
    "this latter result can easily be compared with experimental data extracted from a laboratory setup like that of ref .",
    "@xcite , something that we propose here and that would yield interesting results .",
    "we would like also to underline that the results presented here are also connected with the studies about the nonlinear instability and saturation of pair plasmas , presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the connection is twofold : a ) in that reference it was shown that nonlinear stability is triggered by small amplitude phase - space holes and b ) the final stable equilibrium is indeed a structured equilibrium that should be studied with the tools presented here .",
