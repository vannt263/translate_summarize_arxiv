    "ferroelectric materials are endowed with a thermodynamic spontaneous electric dipole moment per unit volume @xmath0 at a minimum of the free energy per unit volume @xmath1 . both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , the polarization can be changed in direction via a dynamic _ switching _ process accompanied by hysteresis @xcite .",
    "some of the partially understood experimental properties of ferroelectric domains @xcite include the following : ( i ) no unique coercive field is evident during the hysteretic process of switching .",
    "@xcite ( ii ) when an alternating electric field is applied , a hysteretic loop is observed only within a limited frequency band and a limited range of the amplitude - frequency product.@xcite ( iii ) formation of multiple hysteresis loops @xcite are commonly observed .    from the thermodynamic viewpoint",
    ", one often assumes a phenomenological form for the free energy per unit volume @xmath1 and employs the thermodynamic law @xmath2 the thermodynamic electric field is given by @xmath3 the phenomenological free energies adequately describe the equilibrium experimental properties of ferroelectric materials .",
    "the dynamical hysteretic properties of the ferroelectric domains are less well studied from a theoretical viewpoint @xcite . in principle , a changing polarization is equivalent to a current density @xmath4 .",
    "one expects a current density to give rise to a non - equilibrium electric field @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an `` internal resistivity '' .",
    "the above argument leads to the landau - khalatnikov dynamical equation of motion @xcite , @xmath7    the landau - khalatnikov eq.(3 ) has been employed most often in the linearized form close to thermal equilibrium @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the isothermal electric susceptibility . from the linearized landau - khalatnikov eq.(4 ) , one may deduce the relaxation time @xmath10 while the relaxation time @xmath11 can be employed to estimate the switching time , it is evident that hysteretic loops are inherently non - linear .",
    "our purpose is to solve the non - linear landau - khalatnikov eq.(3 ) with a view towards a deeper theoretical understanding of ferroelectric hysteresis .",
    "the solutions to be discussed in the work which follows have been obtained numerically .",
    "the qualitative features deduced from the non - linear landau - khalatnikov eq.(3 ) are in satisfactory agreement with experiment .    in sec .",
    "ii , the landau - khalatnikov equation is considered for the case in which the driving electric field has the form @xmath12 .",
    "the numerically obtained hysteretic curves will be exhibited in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv the effects of thermal noise are explored using the fokker - planck physical kinetic equation @xcite for the probability distribution .",
    "the ferroelectric switching time is computed as a function of the applied electric field . in sec .",
    "v we present the lagrangian form of the equations of motion and extend the theory to include second derivative terms in the differential equation of motion .",
    "the quantum mechanical consequences of the lagrangian formulation of the physical kinetics are discussed in sec.vi .",
    "future prospects for theoretical extensions are discussed in the concluding sec .",
    "to measure hysteretic cycles one applies an electric field to the ferroelectric sample @xmath13 . the landau - khalatnikov equation",
    "@xmath14 then determines how the polarization @xmath15 responds in time . for a stable hysteretic curve ,",
    "one looks for a periodic solution @xmath16 if the polarization @xmath17 and the applied electric field @xmath18 are along an `` easy axis '' , then eq.(6 ) reads @xmath19 we choose for a model free energy , the landau phenomenological form @xmath20 where @xmath21and @xmath22 are , respectively , the polarization and electric susceptibility with a zero static electric field .    for the purpose of numerical integration of eqs.(8 ) and ( 9 ) , one may introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath23 also @xmath24 eqs.(8)-(11 ) now read @xmath25 to calculate a hysteretic loop one must numerically solve eq.(12 ) subject to an initial condition @xmath26 . after integrating eq.(12 ) over one period of @xmath27",
    ", one finds that @xmath28 the initial condition @xmath29 for a hysteretic loop @xmath30 must be a fixed point of the function @xmath31 ; i.e. @xmath32 such fixed points exist only for a limited region of values of the parameters @xmath33 .",
    "thus , only for finite ranges of frequency @xmath34 and driving electric field @xmath35 in eq.(8 ) will give rise to clean periodic hysteresis loops .",
    "for some regimes of frequency and driving electric field , the motion in the phase plane @xmath36 will be chaotic .",
    "the limited range of parameters @xmath33 for observing hysteretic periodic motions in the phase plane is in agreement with well known features observed in ferroelectric experiments .",
    "employing eqs.(1 ) and ( 9 ) , we find that the thermodynamic electric field implied by the model under consideration , @xmath37 obeys @xmath38 the purely thermodynamic eq.(16 ) gives rise to hysteretic behavior at a switching polarization of @xmath39 which occurs at a coercive electric field of @xmath40    when a cyclic process is numerically simulated for the case of finite frequency as in fig.2 , the resulting hysteretic loop looks qualitatively similar to the thermodynamic fig.1 .    however , there are quantitative features which depend on the magnitude of the frequency and the amplitude of the applied oscillating electric field .",
    "for example the dynamical `` coercive field '' deduced from the numerical simulations at finite frequency is quite different from the static thermodynamic `` coercive field '' .",
    "furthermore , the `` shape '' of the hysteretic loop depends strongly on the product of the frequency and the internal resistivity via @xmath41 .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "it is evident , that the dynamically induced coercive field ( for fixed frequency ) depends on the amplitude of the applied electric field .",
    "thus , the large ( outer ) hysteretic loop in fig.3 has a much larger dynamic coercive field than does the small ( inner ) hysteretic loop .",
    "it is not in general possible to deduce the thermodynamic coercive field of eq.(18 ) by the observation of a single dynamical hysteretic loop . from an experimental point of view , this ambiguity in determining the thermodynamic coercive field is a long standing problem .",
    "the existence of an internal resistivity @xmath42 in the landau - khalatnikov eq.(3 ) requires a thermally fluctuating electric field @xmath43 ; i.e. eq.(3 ) with the inclusion of electric field noise reads @xmath44 we have included `` white noise '' field fluctuations obeying @xmath45 if @xmath46 denotes the probability for @xmath47 , then the electric field noise in eqs.(19 ) and ( 20 ) give rise to the fokker - planck equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 in thermal equilibrium , the probability is determined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is determined by the total probability normalization @xmath52 if the polarization @xmath17 and the applied electric field @xmath18 are along an `` easy axis '' , then it is sufficient to use a one - dimensional probability @xmath53 for @xmath54 which obeys a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation @xmath55    the `` jump time '' associated with eq.(25 ) may be computed in a well known manner .",
    "suppose that the polarization at time zero is given by @xmath56 . with a final polarization @xmath57 ,",
    "let @xmath58 $ ] be the mean `` first passage time '' for the polarization to move from a region @xmath59 to the complimentary region @xmath60 .",
    "in detail , let @xmath61 be the smallest positive time for which @xmath62 .",
    "the mean first passage time is then @xmath63 .",
    "the closed form expression for the mean first passage time is well known to be @xmath64=\\left({\\omega \\rho \\over k_b t}\\right)\\times\\ ] ] @xmath65 in principle , it is possible to solve the equation @xmath66\\ ] ] for the final polarization @xmath67 eqs.(26 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) imply @xmath68 where @xmath69    in the limit of large single domains @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 so that eq.(29 ) becomes equivalent to the landau - khalatnikov eq.(3 ) . when @xmath72 , then the landau - khalatnikov equation is sufficiently accurate for computing first passage times",
    ". however , very near critical temperatures and or critical electric ( coercive ) fields , a finite domain can switch due to thermal noise .",
    "the integral in eq.(26 ) for the first passage time must then be evaluated .",
    "in order to understand the extended landau - khalatnikov - tani equation @xcite for ferroelectric single domains , let us first review the extended landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations @xcite for ferromagnetic single domains . for the ferromagnetic case , there exists a free energy per unit volume @xmath73 which obeys the thermodynamic law @xmath74 the thermodynamic magnetic intensity is given by @xmath75 for non - equilibrium situations in an applied magnetic intensity @xmath76 , there is an effective field @xmath77 the equation of motion for the magnetization then reads @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "for the case of a ferroelectric , eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) replace eqs.(31 ) and ( 32 ) , and the effective magnetic intensity eq.(33 ) is replaced by the effective electric field @xmath80 while in the landau - khalatnikov theory , the effective field @xmath81 is set to zero , the tani extension to the landau - khalatnikov theory includes an inertial term of the form @xmath82 let us consider eq.(36 ) in more detail .",
    "the dipole moment of @xmath83 charged particles in a volume @xmath84 is defined as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the position of the @xmath87 particle with charge @xmath88 . from the equation of motion for the @xmath87 particle with mass @xmath89 , @xmath90 and eq.(37 )",
    "one easily obtains eq.(36 ) wherein @xmath91 can be identified with the plasma frequency @xmath92 eqs.(35 ) and ( 36 ) yield the landau - khalatnikov - tani theory for ferroelectric domains ; i.e. @xmath93 eq.(40 ) may be written in terms of the effective lagrangian @xmath94 ; @xmath95 and the rayleigh dissipation function @xmath96 ; @xmath97 we have @xmath98 the canonical `` momentum '' @xmath99 conjugate to the polarization @xmath100 may be defined by @xmath101 employing the lagrangian viewpoint , one may quantize the single ferroelectric domain theory in the usual manner .",
    "in the fully quantum mechanical theory one expects the canonical commutation relation @xmath102=-i\\hbar { \\bf 1}\\ ] ] which may also be proved employing a microscopic view . from eq.(37 ) and ( 44 ) it follows ( with @xmath103 ) that @xmath104 from the microscopic commutation relation @xmath105= -\\left({i\\hbar \\delta_{ij}\\over m_j}\\right){\\bf 1},\\ ] ] together with eqs.(37 ) , ( 39 ) and ( 46 ) follows the macroscopic quantum mechanical commutator in eq.(45 ) .",
    "one representation of the quantum mechanical operator @xmath106 is defined by @xmath107 forming the hamiltonian from the lagrangian in the standard canonical formalism , @xmath108 yields the effective hamiltonian for a ferroelectric domain @xmath109 where eqs.(41 ) , ( 44 ) and ( 49 ) have been invoked .",
    "eqs.(48 ) and ( 50 ) describe a single domain ferroelectric grain in macroscopic quantum mechanical form .    from eqs.(9 ) , ( 48 ) and ( 50 ) one may compute the quasi - classical approximation for the quantum tunneling switching time . at zero electric field",
    "@xmath110 , the quantum transition rate per unit time to switch polarizations ( say @xmath111 ) is given by @xmath112 with a barrier factor given by @xmath113 and an attempt frequency of @xmath114 in eq.(53 ) , the barrier energy per unit volume is @xmath115 and @xmath116 thus @xmath117 quantum tunneling through the barrier will dominate classical thermal activation over the barrier if @xmath118 thus for temperatures small on the scale of @xmath119 quantum tunneling will dominate classical thermal activation . for typical laboratory samples",
    "@xmath120 so that the life - time of domains for very small volume domains is dominated by quantum mechanics",
    ". nevertheless , for large volume domains there is stability and the kinetics are well described by the landau - khalatnikov kinetic equation .",
    "we have shown that physical kinetics , via the landau - khalatnikov equation , adequately describes laboratory hysteretic behavior for large volume single domain ferroelectric materials .",
    "the important physical quantities include the amplitude and frequency dependence of the effective coercive electric field .",
    "the formalism describing thermal noise as well as quantum noise have been explored .",
    "both forms of noise are unimportant for large volume ferroelectric domains . in the small domain volume limit ,",
    "quantum noise effects dominate the classical thermal noise effects at laboratory temperatures substantially below the critical temperature .    the technical importance of ferroelectric switching times for small ferroelectric domain volumes",
    "is well documented @xcite .",
    "the computation of switching times requires mesoscopic quantum mechanical models .",
    "thus far , the theory of such quantum switches is in its infancy .",
