    "<S> are there any degrees of freedom on the black hole horizon ? using the ` membrane paradigm ' we can reproduce coarse - grained physics outside the hole by assuming a fictitious membrane just outside the horizon . but to solve the information puzzle we need ` real ' degrees of freedom at the horizon , which can modify hawking s evolution of quantum modes . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that recent results on gravitational microstates imply a set of real degrees of freedom just outside the horizon ; the state of the hole is a linear combination of rapidly oscillating gravitational solutions with support concentrated just outside the horizon radius . </S>",
    "<S> the collective behavior of these microstate solutions may give a realization of the membrane paradigm , with the fictitious membrane now replaced by real , explicit degrees of freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    = = = = = = = = ============= ==    =    =    membrane paradigm realized ? </S>",
    "<S> +   + department of physics , + the ohio state university , + columbus , oh 43210 , usa + .2 in mathur@mps.ohio-state.edu    1.0 true in    a longstanding puzzle in quantum gravity is the following : is there anything at the black hole horizon ?    </S>",
    "<S> there are many reasons to take the horizon seriously as a place where ` physics happens ' . </S>",
    "<S> the bekenstein entropy @xmath0 of the hole is proportional to the area of the horizon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that we attach one ` bit ' of information to each planck area of the horizon , and perhaps quantize the horizon area to give an integral number of bits @xcite . in loop quantum gravity </S>",
    "<S> the entropy arises from spin degrees of freedom on links that intersect the horizon @xcite . in the schwarzschild </S>",
    "<S> coordinate frame , all matter that ever fell towards the horizon appears to be frozen forever just outside the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this picture was concretized in the ` membrane paradigm ' @xcite , where one puts an artificial cutoff surface just outside the horizon , and finds boundary conditions at this surface which will reproduce correct mechanical and thermal effects in the region outside this surface . </S>",
    "<S> these boundary conditions can be summarized by imagining a fictitious membrane placed at this surface , with appropriate mechanical and thermal properties . in particular , there is a very high temperature near the membrane , </S>",
    "<S> so one might imagine that an infalling observer would get burnt up and eventually reradiated out to infinity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would be good , because to avoid the information paradox we need to have some way of returning the information in infalling objects back to infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> but there turns out to be a flaw in these attempts to assign genuine dynamics to the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the schwarzschild coordinate system fails at the horizon , and the regular coordinates there  the kruskal coordinates  show that _ nothing _ special happens at the horizon of the traditional black hole . </S>",
    "<S> nothing can ` stay ' at the horizon ; all matter must fall in towards the singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature in the schwarzschild frame disappears in the kruskal frame ; it is seen to be nothing but the rindler tempertaure observed in an accelerated system of coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> careful renormalization of the stress tensor shows that there is no energy density at the horizon @xcite ; the energy of rindler quanta is cancelled by vacuum polarization energy , since the physical vacuum at the horizon is naturally described in kruskal rather than schwarzschild coordinates .    what then , about the fate of information falling into the hole ? over the past decade , many physicists had settled down to the following set of beliefs ( i ) information is not lost ; it emerges in the hawking radiation from the hole ( ii ) nothing special happens at the horizon , because the kruskal description looks like the logical one ( iii ) the above two beliefs are consistent because we need only small delicate correlations among hawking quanta to carry the information , and subleading corrections to hawking s computation @xcite should be able to encode the required information in the quanta .    </S>",
    "<S> but if these beliefs were correct , one has to wonder why over the years no one produced a model showing how it was possible for information to get encoded in the radiation while preserving a near - semiclassical hamiltonian at the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this failure emerged last year , when it was proved that ( iii ) is in fact incorrect : it is _ not _ possible to make small corrections to hawking s leading order state and recover any significant information in the radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , if matrix elements of the hamiltonian for low energy modes are within @xmath1 of their semiclassical values , then no more than a fraction @xmath2 of the information can be encoded in the radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of this theorem used a well known inequality from quantum information theory called ` strong subadditivity ' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but no _ elementary _ proof of this inequality is known , so it is perhaps not surprising that its consequences were not built into our naive thinking about encoding of information in the radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> it would now seem that we are back to square one on the information puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> must we reconcile ourselves to information loss ? </S>",
    "<S> we will now argue that another set of results over the past few years gives us a picture of how there can be real dynamics at the horizon , which will lead to an escape of information in the radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> a black hole has given values of of its conserved quantum numbers : mass , charge and angular momentum . in earlier work , </S>",
    "<S> one assumed a simple ansatz for the metric . </S>",
    "<S> thus for the nonrotating hole , one assumed independence of the angular directions @xmath3 for all metric components . in a higher dimensional gravity theory , </S>",
    "<S> the extra directions have to be assumed compact , and the ansatz assumed no dependence of the metric on the compact coordinates @xmath4 either . </S>",
    "<S> einstein s equations then gave a unique solution , possessing a horizon and a singularity  the traditional black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> but it has been now recognized that there are @xmath5 $ ] _ different _ solutions of einstein s equations with the _ same _ quantum numbers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all are regular , with no horizon and no singularity . </S>",
    "<S> none of them are spherically symmetric , and all involve the compact directions in a nontrivial way . </S>",
    "<S> so it was the simplicity of our initial ansatz which led us to miss these solutions . </S>",
    "<S> further , string theory has allowed us to list all possible states for simple sets of quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the regular states mentioned above map in a one - to one and onto way onto the set of all allowed states , while the spherical solution with horizon and singularity is not realized at all .    </S>",
    "<S> this situation gives us an appealing way out of the information problem :    \\(a ) the region far from the hole has an infinite dimensional phase space due to its infinite volume . </S>",
    "<S> very close to the horizon , however , there is again a very large phase space @xcite , from the @xmath5 $ ] solutions  termed microstates  giving the entropy of the hole ( fig.[fone ] ) .        </S>",
    "<S> \\(b ) most of these solutions have nontrivial structure only very close to the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this is because rapid variation of the metric with position costs a lot of energy , and the large redshift near @xmath6 is needed to lower this to the given total energy @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed structure of the solutions can be inferred from the explicitly solutions which have been constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry has _ ergoregions _ , with the direction of frame dragging changing rapidly from place to place ( fig.[ftwo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid space - time time dependence is what keeps the geometrical structure from collapsing towards @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for an analogy , see fig.[fthree ] ; a circular elastic band shrinks to a point , but an rapidly vibrating band stays open with a nontrivial average radius . )            </S>",
    "<S> \\(c ) consider a spherically symmetric shell made of gravitational radiation , collapsing to make a hole . </S>",
    "<S> the motion upto @xmath9 is described by traditional dynamics in the schwarzschild frame ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> but at @xmath11 the wavefunction of the shell can spread over the @xmath5 $ ] alternative solutions of einstein s equations . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for this spread can be estimated by computing the _ tunneling _ </S>",
    "<S> amplitude between the shell and one of the microstate solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude @xmath12 $ ] is very _ small _ , since the involved objects are macroscopic and the classical action of tunneling @xmath13 is big . but </S>",
    "<S> the _ number _ of states that we can tunnel to very _ large _ </S>",
    "<S> , given by @xmath5 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that @xmath14 @xcite , so instead of making a long lived black hole , the shell state becomes a linear superposition of microstate solutions in a time which is much shorter than the hawking evaporation time @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(d ) it has been checked that ergoregion emission from the microstate solutions reproduces exactly the hawking radiation rate expected from those solutions @xcite . but this emission does not involve information loss , since there is no horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(e ) the further evolution of the collapsing shell is given by the evolution of the linear superposition of microstates into which it has tunneled . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible that the short time evolution of the collective modes of these complicated microstates can be mimicked by evolution in the interior of the traditional black hole geometry . </S>",
    "<S> this effective evolution would then corresponds to the interior of the black hole in the penrose diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note here that the typical microstate is not a classical solution in which infalling quanta scatter around in a zig - zag path . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the large phase space of fuzzball solutions creates a very large ` coordination number '  the number of states that can be reached from a given state by a small action @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this may make the black hole a ` fast scrambler ' @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> an infalling heavy object excites a linear combination of fuzzball states , similar to the ` fermi - golden rule ' absorption encountered when we have a closely spaced band of energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> different objects excite different degrees of freedom to leading order , since the number of excitable states is so large ; the small overlap between different sets of excited states gives the residual interaction that mimics the usual ( weak ) gravitational interaction between different quanta ( the dual cft description of this effect was noted in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the effective dynamics of absorption into fuzzballs gets related to motion in gently curved space , in a manner similar to absorption by the large number of open string degrees of freedom on a stack of d - branes : the infalling quantum excites these open strings , different quanta typically excite different strings ( due to the large number of these strings ) , and the small overlap between the set of excited strings generates the effective gravitational interactions between infalling quanta . </S>",
    "<S> thus in this picture we would think of both ads / cft duality @xcite and the above mentioned effective description of fuzzballs as arising from the same underlying physics : absorption into a dense set of levels with high coordination number .    </S>",
    "<S> with this picture we seem to have an explicit realization of the membrane paradigm . in several earlier works , effective gravitational dynamics or dual cft descriptions </S>",
    "<S> have been used to infer an imaginary ` membrane ' that may sit at the horizon @xcite . by contrast </S>",
    "<S> , we are now addressing how gravity manages to actually produce something at the horizon that is capable of sending information back out in the hawking radiation . in our description </S>",
    "<S> the membrane has real degrees of freedom on it , given by the rapidly oscillating solutions of einstein s equations that correspond to the black hole microstates </S>",
    "<S> . it would be exciting to explore if the collective dynamics of the microstates reproduces the very precise properties of the fictitious membrane of the membrane paradigm . </S>"
