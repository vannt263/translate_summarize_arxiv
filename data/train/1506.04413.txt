    "the concept of diquark was introduced by gell - mann in 1964 @xcite and soon afterwards the effective degrees of freedom of diquarks were used in order to describe baryons as bound states of a constituent quark and diquark @xcite .",
    "there are several phenomenological arguments in favor of diquark correlations @xcite .",
    "for example , it is known that the quark - diquark model does not predict the existence of the @xmath0 su@xmath1(6 ) multiplet , which on the contrary is predicted by three quarks constituent quark models . if one decomposes such su(6)@xmath1 multiplet in terms of su@xmath2(3 ) @xmath3 su@xmath4(2 ) , one gets a spin-@xmath5 flavor octet and a spin-@xmath6 flavor singlet : the absence of the spin-@xmath6 flavor singlet from pdg @xcite represents an argument in favour of quark - diquark models .",
    "there are also phenomenological indications , regarding the regge behavior of hadrons , the @xmath7 rule in weak nonleptonic decays @xcite , some regularities in parton distribution functions @xcite and in spin - dependent structure functions @xcite and in @xmath8 and @xmath9 fragmentation functions @xcite",
    ". moreover it is well known that any interaction , that is strong enough to bind @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons in the so called rainbow - ladder approximation of qcd s dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) , will also produce diquarks @xcite .",
    "furthermore indications for diquark confinement have also been provided @xcite .",
    "this makes plausibly enough to make diquarks a part of the baryon s wave function .",
    "other interesting approaches to baryon ( meson ) spectroscopy and structure , studied within other types of models and/or formalisms , can be found in refs .",
    "we assume that baryons are composed of a constituent diquark and quark",
    ". the effective degree of freedom of diquark describes two strongly correlated quarks , without internal spatial excitations ( thus in @xmath12 wave ) .",
    "the diquark has to be in the @xmath13 representation of su@xmath14(3 ) , since the baryon must be colorless .",
    "thus the possible su@xmath1(6 ) representations for the diquark are limited to the symmetric @xmath15 representation , that contains the @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] representations .",
    "the notation used here is @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 stands for the dimension of the su@xmath2(3 ) representation and @xmath20 for the spin of the diquark .",
    "if one calculates the quark - quark interaction due to one gluon exchange , the channel @xmath21 looks energetically favoured @xcite and thus such configuration , i.e. @xmath16 $ ] ( spin singlet , antisymmetric in flavor ) , is defined by wilczek @xcite and jaffe @xcite as `` good '' diquark ( or scalar diquark ) , while the other one , i.e. @xmath17 $ ] ( spin triplet , symmetric in flavor ) , is defined as `` bad '' diquark ( or axial - vector diquark ) .",
