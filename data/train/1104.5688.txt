    "kolmogorov stochasticity parameter approach has been used to quantify the degree of randomness of sequences of number theory or dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the stochasticity degree of the fractional parts of the arithmetical progressions has been analysed , including in comparison with geometrical progressions@xcite .",
    "the crucial aspect of the application of the method is the behavior of the stochasticity parameter .",
    "arnold studied the randomness for arithmetical progressions of the residues for the division by a real number and other sequences , using the uniform or the legendre - chebyshev distributions @xcite , mentioning also the problems for which still no solutions are known .    along with this",
    ", physical applications of this descriptor of the degree of randomness have been also undertaken .",
    "namely , astrophysical signals which contain several subsignals , i.e. contributions of radiation of different physical mechanisms , are of particular interest .",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation observational datasets do contain besides the cosmological signal , also contributions of galactic and other origins @xcite .",
    "it appears that the different degree of randomness quantified by kolmogorov distribution enables to distinguish the cosmological and non - cosmological signals @xcite .",
    "the fractions of the random and correlated gaussian components in the cmb overall signal have been obtained using that method @xcite .",
    "it was also efficient for the identification in the cmb maps obtained by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite of point sources @xcite , i.e. of radio , as well as gamma - ray sources observed by the fermi satellite .",
    "the properties of the cmb signal follow from primordial fluctuations which appear to be close to gaussian ones .",
    "this remarkable empirical fact is fortunate for our approach , since it unambiguously defines the theoretical cumulative distribution function required to compute the stochasticity parameter .",
    "although certain non - gaussian features have been observed in the cmb datasets ( see @xcite ) and they are studied by various descriptors , the gaussianity remains as one of the robust characteristics of cmb .",
    "however in other astrophysical signals , for example , for lyman - alpha forest , the mentioned distribution function can not be so well defined and therefore the problem of statistics becomes more complex .",
    "in such conditions , the numerical experiments are the means to explore the behavior of the stochasticity parameter vs the generated random and regular components of the signal .",
    "thus the universality of kolmogorov s theorem is elaborated in the numerical experiments .",
    "first , let us briefly review the method . consider @xmath0 independent values of the same real - valued random variable @xmath1 in growing order @xmath2 and let @xcite @xmath3 be a cumulative distribution function of @xmath1 .",
    "their empirical distribution function @xmath4 is defined as    @xmath5    kolmogorov s stochasticity parameter is @xmath6    kolmogorov theorem @xcite states that for any continuous @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 the convergence is uniform and kolmogorov s distribution @xmath11 is independent on @xmath7 .",
    "since the stochasticity parameter itself is a random quantity its probable values are defined by the distribution function @xmath11 , namely , the interval @xmath12 , where @xmath13 provides information on the degree of randomness .",
    "the sky map of the degree of randomness for cmb is shown in fig .",
    "1 : the map contains both the cosmological , as well as non - cosmological signals , e.g. the clearly visible galactic disk ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "below we will study more tiny appearances of the kolmogorov function vs the properties of the signals .",
    "for the full sky cosmic microwave background temperature data obtained by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe.,width=0 ]",
    "using the kolmogorov method we will study the properties of sequences of type @xmath14 where @xmath15 are random sequences and @xmath16 are regular sequences , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are mutually fixed prime numbers , both sequences within the interval @xmath19 and have uniform distribution , @xmath20 indicating the fraction of random and regular sequences .",
    "this representation is a more general case of random and regular sequences considered in @xcite .",
    "other techniques for dealing with astrophysical systems with random ( chaotic ) and regular behavior are discussed in @xcite .    when doing statistic with large number of sequences , each new sequence @xmath21 is taken as the continuation of the previous one from the same arithmetical progression .",
    "thus we have @xmath22 with a distribution function    @xmath23    we will analyze the stochastic properties of @xmath22 vs the parameter @xmath20 varying between @xmath24 and @xmath25 for different values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. corresponding from purely stochastic to purely regular sequences .    by fixing the values @xmath17 and @xmath18 , namely , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , we generated 100 different sequences @xmath22 for each value of @xmath20 within @xmath24 and @xmath25 by step @xmath28 , each sequence containing 10,000 elements .",
    "then , each sequence is divided into 50 subsequences and for each subsequence the parameter @xmath29 is calculated ( @xmath30 runs through values @xmath31 ) and the empirical distribution function @xmath32 of these numbers was constructed . in the case",
    "when the original sequences are random , this distribution should be uniform according to kolmogorov s theorem .",
    "therefore , in general case we calculated @xmath33 of the functions @xmath32 and @xmath34 to have an indicator for randomness .",
    "thus one parameter @xmath33 is calculated per each of @xmath35 sequence .",
    "grouping @xmath36 @xmath33 values per one value of @xmath20 , we constructed mean and error values for @xmath33 .",
    "so , for each pair of @xmath17 and @xmath18 we get one plot : dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath20 .",
    "two examples of such dependence are given in fig.[fig : chi_sq ] .",
    "for the kolmogorov s function for the sequence @xmath22 and of its subsequences vs @xmath20 indicating the contribution of the random and regular parts for the pair of indicated input parameters.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ] for the kolmogorov s function for the sequence @xmath22 and of its subsequences vs @xmath20 indicating the contribution of the random and regular parts for the pair of indicated input parameters.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]    fig.[fig : chi_sq ] shows the variation of @xmath33 vs @xmath20 varying from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , which corresponds to the gradual change of sequences @xmath22 from regular to random",
    ".    then we study the behavior of this relation from parameter @xmath17 for different values of @xmath18 .",
    "first we define a parameter @xmath37 which equals to the difference of two values in the above plots : maximal value of @xmath33 and minimal value in the range @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the place of the maximal value ; e.g. it is obvious that for the left plot @xmath40 and for the right one @xmath41 .",
    "the next step is to fix @xmath18 and for each value of @xmath42 calculate @xmath37 .",
    "this is done for several values of @xmath18 .",
    "vs the parameter @xmath17.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]   vs the parameter @xmath17.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]    fig.[fig : deltas ] shows strict mirror symmetry in the dependence of @xmath37 vs @xmath17 , although no periodicity has been found by fourier analysis .",
    "then we proceeded via two types of analysis .",
    "first , we studied the values and the distribution of @xmath37 and , the second , with the spacing between non - zero @xmath37 and their distribution .",
    "since obviously , most values of @xmath37 are the null ones , we skipped them , also due to the mirror symmetry each @xmath37 comes with its pair and therefore only one of each pair is taken into account .",
    "fig.[fig : y1 ] exhibits @xmath37s sorted in growing order , i.e. on the abscissa axis we have the number of non - zero @xmath37s from fig.[fig : deltas ] .",
    "the number of non - zero @xmath37s appear to be proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "s from fig.[fig : deltas].,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ] s from fig.[fig : deltas].,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]    using the same values of @xmath37s we calculated the frequency counts ( fig.[fig : y2 ] ) , which showed the decrease of the number of non - zero @xmath37s with the decrease of their values .     from fig.[fig :",
    "deltas].,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]   from fig.[fig : deltas].,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]    the analysis of the spacings was done in the following way .",
    "we collected the distances of all neighbour non - zero @xmath37s and constructed their frequency counts as shown in fig.[fig : x1 ] : smaller gaps are more common than larger ones .",
    "we also see the maximal gaps between non - zero @xmath37s to be @xmath43 , which do not change monotonically depending on @xmath20 .",
    "s.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ] s.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]    now let us follow for the features of signals formed as sum of many fluctuations each having the same standard deviation .",
    "we generated two type of sequences , again of 10,000 elements each .",
    "frequency counts for the set of random and regular sequences as compared with a gaussian function.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]   frequency counts for the set of random and regular sequences as compared with a gaussian function.,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]     for the sequences in fig.[fig : chi_dist].,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]   for the sequences in fig.[fig : chi_dist].,title=\"fig:\",width=227 ]     in fig.7 vs the number of the fluctuations.,width=323 ]    the first one is given as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 is compactified arithmetical sequence within the interval @xmath47 , with step @xmath48 .",
    "we call this a regular sequence",
    ".    the second sequence is @xmath49 which we denote as a random one .",
    "here we used the following notation : @xmath50 indicates multiples of @xmath51 from @xmath52 having the value within the range ( p , q ) .",
    "the comparison of the sequences is done by means of kolmogorov parameter with varying also the values of n.    the results for 10,000 random and regular sequences each in fig.[fig : chi_dist ] show the typical differences for @xmath33 when the number of the fluctuations vary from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the equal scales of @xmath33 shows that in both cases i.e. random and regular sequences , we deal with a guassian distribution , in accordance with the central limit theorem .",
    "that theorem states that for large enough values of @xmath55 , both sequences @xmath56 and @xmath57 tend to gaussian sequences with the same @xmath58 and @xmath59 not depending on @xmath55 .",
    "along with that , however , we see differences in the gaussians , namely , the standard deviations are larger for the regular case .    involving then the kolmogorov function @xmath11 , we see that although we have gaussians both in random and regular cases , the behavior of @xmath11 is quite different , as shown in fig.[fig : phi ] , i.e. it is close to a homogeneous function for random sequences and @xmath60 for regular ones .",
    "so , the kolmogorov s function enables to distinguish the superposition of random and regular sequences , although both are tending to gaussians .",
    "this analysis does not show any significant dependence on the length of the sequences , also dependence on the number of the fluctuations within @xmath61 is rather weak as seen in fig.[fig : n ] .",
    "the performed numerical analysis aimed to reveal the behavior of the kolmogorov distribution vs the randomness of generated signals . to describe astrophysical datasets which contain both regular and stochastic components , we considered sequences scaled by a single parameter @xmath20 , the ratio of those components .",
    "both qualitative signatures and their quantitative scalings have been observed at the numerical experiments .",
    "namely , the appearance of a critical value of @xmath20 has been shown , which defines the qualitative change in the behavior of the frequency count of the kolmogorov distribution : the monotonic decay is transformed to a function with extremum . then , the dependence of these features vs the @xmath20 reveals mirror properties in the amplitude and distribution of the frequency counts of the function @xmath11 .",
    "then , the behavior of the randomness for large number of subsignals has been also revealed , where the kolmogorov function acts as an informative descriptor .",
    "particularly , the descriptor is informative at large @xmath55 limit when the sum both of random and regular signals tends to a guassian , in accordance to the central limit theorem , with the larger variance for the regular subsignals . in the case of the cosmic microwave backgound , for example",
    ", the contributions to the overall detected signal , besides the cosmological one , typically are due to the galactic synchrotron and dust emissions , star forming galaxies , point sources ( quasars , blazars ) , instrumental noise , etc .",
    "the behaviors obtained at the numerical experiments due to the universality of the approach will serve as indicators in the study of various astrophysical signals , including in revealing the contributions of the regular and stochastic components ."
