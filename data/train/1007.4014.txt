    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs hereafter ) represent an important population among extragalactic objects . in particular ,",
    "spiral lsbgs are characterized by a disk surface brightness at least one order of magnitude lower than the canonical value of 21.65 mag arcsec@xmath5 proposed by @xcite .",
    "the central surface brightness of the disk in the @xmath6-band , @xmath7 , is the photometric parameter typically used to distinguish between the high and the low surface brightness regime of galaxies .",
    "the most common threshold values found in the literature are between 22 and 23 mag arcsec@xmath5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "although lsbgs share many of the properties also found in high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs ) , they also present a significant list of challenging observational features .",
    "just to mention the most intriguing ones ( some of them will be explained more extensively in the next paragraph ) , they have a very low stellar density ( which actually produces the low surface brightness ) , but exhibit astonishing flat rotation curves , reaching large radii from the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this implies that lsbgs are one of the most dark matter dominated systems in the universe , given their high m / l ratio @xcite .",
    "another striking feature in lsbgs is the richness of their stellar populations , which span the whole range of the hr - diagram @xcite , challenging the extraordinary deficit in molecular gas , as detected so far @xcite .",
    "finally , the low star formation rate ( sfr ) in combination with their rather isolated location in the cosmic web @xcite , as reported by several authors ( see below ) , give clues for the understanding of their formation and evolution . among the mentioned properties , we highlight three of them related with the purpose of this work .",
    "first , it seems that lsbgs evolve following a similar track of high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs ) , but with a significantly slower rate of star forming processes @xcite .",
    "second , systematic evidence shows that lsbgs are strongly dominated by dark matter @xcite .",
    "then , far from being fragile , simulations suggest that disks of lsbgs would be very stable against the propagation of gravitational instabilities which are typically generated by interactions with , for example , a close neighbor @xcite .",
    "finally , lsbgs would be more isolated than hsbgs at small scales ( less than 2 mpc ) , according to @xcite , and between 2 mpc and 5 mpc @xcite .",
    "these last results motivate the following question : is the isolation of lsbgs a requisite for their formation or for their subsequent evolution ?",
    "in other words , if the reaction of lsbgs to close interactions results in the enhancement of their star formation activity , as has been previously observed in hsbgs @xcite , then the lack of tidal encounters in a hubble time , because of their isolation , could explain the less evolved nature of lsbgs respect to hsbgs @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if lsbgs are strongly influenced by the interactions , then the isolation would indicate a fast transition from an lsb regime to the hsb regime in high density environments . in an effort to better understand the relationship between the spatial distribution of lsbgs and their star formation properties , we focus our attention in a carefully selected sample of this kind of galaxies extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 ( dr 4 ) @xcite , as well as in a similarly selected control sample of high surface brightness galaxies from the same catalog .",
    "along with the analysis of the degree of isolation of lsbgs , we will focus our attention on the possible relationship between the local density and their star - formation properties , including the behavior of lsbgs in pairs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sample ]",
    "we describe the galaxy selection from the sdss dr 4 and the corrections applied to such a selection , showing also some basic relationships ; in  [ density ] we define the density estimators to be used in the analysis , as well as the tools to define galaxy pairs . in  [ results ]",
    "we analyse the most important results regarding the environment and the star - formation properties of lsbgs , including an analysis of the lsb population exhibiting an agn .",
    "we discuss our results within the scope of the recent work by other authors in  [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the galaxies studied in this work were extracted from the main galaxy sample @xcite of the sdss data release 4 ( dr 4 ) . following a similar procedure to that presented by @xcite",
    ", we select preferentially late type galaxies ( @xmath8 ) with spectroscopically computed redshifts , nearly face - on to avoid serious extinction correction ( @xmath9 ) , not too nearby to avoid problems with peculiar velocities ( @xmath10 ) and , to avoid serious incompleteness effects , not too distant ( @xmath11 , see also rosenbaum et al .",
    "note that @xcite , using also the sdss , selected galaxies with @xmath12 . in spite",
    "that this last figure seems to be quite different than our selection criteria , we realize that most of the lsbgs included in our sample ( 86% ) do have @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that recently , @xcite did an excellent work selecting lsbgs from the same catalog ( dr 4 ) , and concluded that the sdss is biased to select two different kinds of galaxies in two different redshift intervals , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which span our redshift selection . in the first redshift range , most of the lsbgs are dwarf - type galaxies , lmc - like . in the second redshift range ,",
    "the majority of galaxies are massive , well defined spiral systems ( where in fact one can very well define a disk and bulge ) . with our luminosity profile selection ( @xmath15 ) we are only loosing some extreme lsbgs with a huge bulge component and very faint disks ( i.e. galaxies where the de vaucouleurs component contributes more than 90% of the total light ) . on the other hand , irregular galaxies enter in our catalog if an exponential light profile is possible to be fitted , which is the case for about 95% of the cases in the spectroscopic catalog .",
    "therefore , comparisons between this work and the one by @xcite can in principle be made .",
    "in fact , further in the text it is possible to conclude that our results regarding the large - scale distribution and the distribution of lsbgs in terms of the local density , agree well with rosenbaum et al ..    since the spectroscopic catalog of the sdss is a magnitude - limited survey ( @xmath16 mag ) , the observed populations of galaxies are not the same as the redshift increases .",
    "in fact , when going farther in redshift , a magnitude - limited selection introduces a strong bias selecting more luminous ( and massive ) galaxies .",
    "this prevents us to compare in a statistical way nearby galaxies with galaxies situated at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore , one has to define a redshift range ( i.e. a volume and a lower luminosity limit ) where the absolute magnitude distributions are the same for all the galaxy populations .",
    "a volume - limited catalog allows us to compare two populations of lsbgs and hsbgs having roughly the same absolute magnitude range and therefore with roughly the same mass cuts , as we show in furthers sections .",
    "another way to correct for the bias from a magnitude - limited catalog is to use the @xmath17 approach , which will also be used ( see the end of  [ volume_correction ] ) .",
    "since the criterion for lsb classification is done in the johnson @xmath6 band , and the sdss filters does not include it , we are forced to transform the sdss @xmath18 and @xmath19 magnitudes into @xmath6-johnson magnitudes . using information derived from the fit of a pure exponential profile included in the sdss data , we calculate the surface brightness in the @xmath18- and @xmath19-band . then , from the conversions of @xcite , we get the surface brightness in the @xmath6-band , which is computed as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the apparent magnitude in the @xmath6 band , the second factor is the area where the light is measured ( enclosing 90% of the light ) , the third factor is the inclination correction ( where @xmath22 is the semi - major axis , @xmath4 is the minor axis ) assuming a disk of uniform radiance , and the fourth factor is the surface brightness correction for the cosmological dimming ( the well - known @xmath23 factor ) .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath4 parameters are defined from the photometric exponential fit to the galaxy using a surface brightness cut value of @xmath24 mag arcsec@xmath5 , we select a sample of 9,421 lsbgs from the complete spectroscopic catalog of 567,486 galaxies , i.e. 1.66% of the galaxies of the total sample are lsbgs .",
    "these galaxies satisfy the surface brightness cut and also the redshift , inclination and morphology constraints specified in  [ selecting ] . applying the same redshift cuts and imposing the same spectroscopic flags as for the lsb sample , we select 30,000 hsb galaxies .",
    "in addition to the sloan spectroscopic information , we have added information from @xcite , which includes the star formation rate , the estimated stellar mass for each galaxy ( @xmath25 ) and the 4000    break index ( d@xmath264000 ) .",
    "also , with the aim to flag galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , we cross - correlate our catalog with that of @xcite .",
    "these galaxies have to be excluded from our analysis when studying the light and colors supposedly coming from canonical star forming processes . therefore ,",
    "if one excluded galaxies with agn , then the number of lsbgs is reduced to 8,926 and the number of hsbgs to 24,324 .",
    "specific studies of agn are presented in a forthcoming paper ( however , see  [ agn ] ) .      in order to correct the bias introduced from the differences in both the redshift and absolute magnitude distributions for the hsbgs and lsbgs , we weight the fractions and averages with the inverse of the maximum volume out to which each galaxy can be detected in the sdss ( i.e. we use the @xmath17 method , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ petro_abs ] shows the relationship between the absolute magnitude , the petrosian radius @xmath3-band . ] and the exponential scale - length , for hsbgs ( in black ) as well as for lsbgs ( in red ) .",
    "this figure clearly presents the combined bias resulting from two selection functions , namely , the strong dependence of the absolute magnitude vs. redshift in the sdss spectroscopic catalog ( a magnitude - limited catalog ) , and the trend of the absolute magnitude on the galaxy size . by weighting each galaxy for its accessible volume using the factor @xmath17 , we correct the effective fractions of galaxies , specially the few ones detected at faint absolute magnitudes ( the bottom edge in figure [ petro_abs ] ) . figure [ petro_abs ] clearly shows that for a given absolute magnitude , lsbgs are larger than hsbgs .",
    "note that our sample of galaxies also includes some irregular galaxies , but not the usually faint ones .",
    "these have small values of fracdev ( @xmath27 ) and faint absolute magnitudes ( usually @xmath28 , see figure [ petro_abs ] ) . given that our spectroscopic catalogue is a magnitude limited catalog with with @xmath29 mag , these galaxies are visible only up to @xmath30 , which is exactly the redshift we start to consider for this study .",
    "then we do not detect these faint irregulars .",
    "to have an idea about how many irregulars are we loosing up to such a redshift we first selected the total number of lsbgs and hsbgs up to @xmath31 , which gives 741 and 1099 respectively . from these , about 30% are galaxies of small petrosian radius ( smaller than 2 kpc ) .",
    "this fraction is about the same for the low surface brightness and the high surface brightness population , as shown by the solid and dashed lines of the histogram .",
    "if irregulars are represented by these galaxies , that means that we are loosing a 40% of the total sample , which is a significant fraction .",
    "however , only 30% of them are fainter than @xmath32 .",
    "also , it is well known that there are also lsbgs with small radius and not necessarily irregulars , for example dwarf galaxies that enter into our sample @xcite .",
    "so the fraction of irregulars is probably smaller than 40% . to be sure ,",
    "we have examined in detail the number of irregulars at @xmath33 that are included in the sample of 741 lsbgs up to @xmath34 .",
    "we found , _ by eye _ , that 127 ( 17% ) of these are clearly irregulars .",
    "a significant number of galaxies , about the same fraction , are dwarf systems with sizes @xmath35 kpc or smaller .",
    "figure [ gen_props ] shows the distribution of properties extracted from our sample of lsbgs and hsbgs , considering the @xmath17 weight",
    ". looking at the two upper histograms , we observe indeed that lsbgs ( in red ) and hsbgs ( in black ) do not have the same redshift and absolute magnitude distributions .",
    "this figure is consistent with figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "the middle panels in figure [ gen_props ] show the fractional histograms for the stellar mass and the star formation rate , for hsbgs and lsbgs , weighted by the @xmath17 factor .",
    "we see that lsbgs peak at slightly less massive objects compared to hsbgs , and also with a broader mass distribution .",
    "a similar result is observed for the sfr distribution ( right panel ) , where the lsbgs peak at about 0.9 m@xmath36/yr , compared to hsbgs , which in average form more stars per year , 1.8 m@xmath36/yr , as expected .",
    "the two bottom panels show the distributions of the birthrate parameter @xmath4 and the petrosian radius , respectively .",
    "the birthrate parameter is defined as    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the total stellar mass fraction which is ejected to the interstellar medium ( ism ) during the lifetime of the galaxy , @xmath39 is the hubble time , and the ratio @xmath40 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit of solar mass ( also called specific sfr ) .",
    "usually @xmath38 is set as 0.5 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , figure [ gen_props ] shows that lsbgs and hsbgs have the same birthrate parameter distribution , when corrected by the @xmath17 factor .",
    "also , the right histogram shows that lsbgs and hsbgs have clearly different petrosian radius @xmath3 distributions , both in range and peak values .",
    "all the distributions shown in figure [ gen_props ] are slightly modified if one directly uses a volume - limited sample of galaxies , instead of the @xmath17 weighted distributions .",
    "however , even though the absolute magnitude - redshift bias is eliminated , the number of galaxies is small .",
    "another drawback of having a volume - limited sample is that the catalog now includes preferentially bright galaxies , in our case galaxies brighter than @xmath41 mag .",
    "when this cut in absolute magnitude is used , the total number of lsbgs is reduced to 1,110 , and the corresponding number of hsbgs to 7,526 .",
    "figure [ gen_props_corrected ] shows the same histograms as figure [ gen_props ] but for the volume - limited sample .",
    "we see that most of them are consequently modified , especially the redshift and absolute magnitude distributions , as expected .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ gen_props_corrected ] shows that now the two populations do have more similar stellar mass distributions ( easily understood from the now similar absolute magnitude distribution ) , although lsbgs still have lower masses .    also , now the birthrate distributions for lsbgs and hsbgs",
    "are no longer the same .",
    "indeed as expected , lsbgs form in average , less solar masses per year , during their lifetime . that could be interpreted as the fact that although lsbgs and hsbgs could have the same stellar formation history , lsbgs form stars in a longer periods of time .",
    "finally , the right bottom panel indicate that the petrosian radius distributions are not only still different , as expected from the definition itself of low surface brightness , but are markedly different , both in peak values and in range .",
    "table [ stat_props ] shows the averaged quantities studied in figure [ gen_props ] and [ gen_props_corrected ] for lsbgs as well as for hsbgs .",
    "in average , lsbgs with the same average total absolute magnitudes of the hsb counterparts , have the same stellar mass , but form 8 times less solar masses per year , and are 1.5 times larger than hsbgs .",
    "note also that the average @xmath4 parameter is higher in hsbgs than in lsbgs , for the two ways of weighting galaxies . in particular , for the volume limited sample , lsbgs form almost 10 times less stars per unit mass than hsbgs .",
    "in this section we briefly define the density estimators that will be used to analyze the degree of isolation of our sample of lsbgs .",
    "we also define the parameters and criteria to define our sample of pairs .",
    "we use two methods to estimate the spatial density of galaxies : ( 1 ) the object counting in a fixed aperture over the sky , and ( 2 ) the distance to the n@xmath42-closest neighbor for a given galaxy . in both cases ,",
    "we only use the galaxies included in the volume - limited sample ( @xmath43 ) .    in the first method , also used by @xcite for 340 lsbgs , and recently by @xcite , we count the number of galaxies in cylinders of fixed height ( @xmath44 km / s ) and radii up to 5 mpc in steps of 0.25 mpc , to calculate the surface density of galaxies inside each cylinder . for a given galaxy",
    "the number of neighbors included in each cylinder allows to define a surface density of galaxies as a function of radius , which in turn can be used to define its local density .    in the second method ,",
    "we compute both the projected distance to the nearest neighbor @xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath46 ) within a velocity shell of @xmath44 km / s , and the projected distance to the fifth nearest neighbor @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , brighter than the k - corrected absolute magnitude m@xmath49 , and within a velocity range of @xmath50 km / s .",
    "this last estimator allows us to characterize the local environment around the target galaxy by means of the well - known surface density parameter @xmath51 @xcite defined by    @xmath52    where @xmath47 is the projected distance to the 5@xmath42-closest and brighter than @xmath41 mag neighbor .",
    "in this section we analyze the spatial distribution of the volume - limited sample of lsbgs and hsbgs , using the two estimators defined in  [ density ] .",
    "figure [ d1_d5 ] shows the cumulative distribution of @xmath45 ( left panel ) and @xmath47 ( right panel ) for both lsbgs ( red lines ) and hsbgs ( black lines ) .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that for both neighbor definitions , lsbgs are more isolated than hsbgs , specially at scales smaller than 5 mpc .",
    "indeed , at a fixed cumulative fraction , lsbgs tend to have the fifth nearest neighbor _ farther _ away than hsbgs , in the region @xmath53mpc for @xmath45 and almost the full range of scales shown for @xmath47 ( @xmath54mpc ) . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test rejects , with high level of confidence ( @xmath55 ) , the hypothesis that the distance distribution is the same for both samples of galaxies .",
    "this behavior is still more apparent for scales smaller than 2 mpc .",
    "note that we do not observe a significant degree of isolation in lsbgs at intermediate scales as described by @xcite , probably because we are using a volume - limited sample .",
    "when using the cylinder estimator one gets the same results as with the nearest first and fifth neighbor .",
    "a better estimator of the degree of isolation of galaxies , other than the pure cylinder counts , is the surface density of galaxies around a given target galaxy ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this estimator is shown in figure [ surface_density ] , where it is apparent that lsbgs ( red ) have a lower number of companions than hsbgs ( black ) , specially at scales smaller than 1.5 mpc .",
    "the percentage of galaxies without neighbors at @xmath56 mpc is @xmath57 for lsbgs and @xmath58 for hsbgs .",
    "note that high density environments are not exclusively inhabited by hsbgs .",
    "nearly @xmath59 of lsbgs have 8 or more neighbors at @xmath60 mpc , compared to @xmath61 for the hsb case .",
    "note that all the above indicators show that on average lsbgs are more isolated than hsbgs .",
    "however , it is worth noting that although the last affirmation is correct , it is also true that some lsbgs are also located in dense environments , in particular in groups and pairs , as will be discussed in  [ interactinglsbgs ] .    with the aim to characterize the extremes of the local density as populated by lsbgs , we follow the same convention as @xcite , who defined _ isolated _ galaxies as those having no neighbors up to a distance of 2 mpc . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies having 8 or more neighbors up to the same radius of 2 mpc , are defined as _",
    "populars_. using this criterion , 14%@xmath622% and 18%@xmath622% of lsbgs in our sample are classified as isolated and populars , respectively .",
    "interestingly , a similar fraction of isolated hsb galaxies is found ( 13%@xmath621% ) .",
    "however , the fraction of popular galaxies for hsbgs is clearly larger than for lsbgs : 23%@xmath621% .",
    "therefore , this approach indicates that lsbgs are not necessarily more isolated than hsbgs , but less `` sociable '' at scales smaller than 2 mpc .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with those early results by @xcite for their small sample of 340 lsbgs .      among the many issues regarding the formation and evolution of lsbgs ,",
    "their ( deficient ) star forming properties as a function of the environment is one of the most unexplored .",
    "the conclusion of  [ isolated ] could hold clues about the elusive connection between the local density and the star - formation properties of lsbgs . from table",
    "[ props_sfr ] , which includes averaged values for the absolute magnitude , color , the birthrate parameter @xmath4 and d@xmath264000 , we are unable to conclude that environment variations can produce a significant difference on the stellar formation activity between lsbgs and hsbgs , at least on the scales included in the table .",
    "it is worth to note that we have excluded agn galaxies from the analysis , using the agn catalog by ( see  [ agn ] ) .",
    "if the environment has a different influence on the stellar formation activity in lsbgs and hsbgs , such an influence should be seen at small scales , where interactions between galaxies take place .    to investigate the impact of interactions on the star forming properties on both lsbgs and hsbgs",
    ", we built a sample of pairs from the main lsb and hsb catalogs .",
    "the pairs sample is built using limits on the radial velocity differences ( @xmath63 ) between the central galaxy and its first neighbor , and the projected distance in mpc ( @xmath45 ) normalized by the galaxy radius ( here @xmath3 , in kpc in the @xmath19 band ) .",
    "this is the same approach as used in @xcite , and @xcite , allowing to measure the distance to the corresponding companion in terms of the influence radius of a galaxy .",
    "we note that the close neighbor of a given target lsb or hsb galaxy is extracted from the whole spectroscopic sdss database , not necessarily included in our constrained catalogs of lsbgs and hsbgs .",
    "this means that the neighbor can have any morphology , surface brightness , color or magnitude ( both apparent or absolute ) .",
    "the catalog of pairs is composed by galaxies that satisfy , along with the neighbor galaxy , only two constraints : @xmath64 km / s , and @xmath65 .",
    "the number of pairs selected for the sample without cuts in absolute magnitude turns out to be 268 and 868 for lsbgs and hsbgs , respectively .",
    "if we only consider galaxies with a cut in absolute magnitude ( i.e. galaxies with @xmath66 mag ) then the number of pairs where the target galaxy is an lsb decreases to only 67 pairs .",
    "this number is too small to extract statistical properties .",
    "therefore , for this analysis we use the complete sample of lsbgs and hsbgs , without any cut in absolute magnitude , but correcting statistically the counts by the @xmath17 weight .",
    "we also built control samples from the galaxies not included in the pair selection criteria , as counterparts for both the lsbgs and hsbgs pairs ; the control galaxies have the same absolute magnitude distribution as the those in pairs ( see figure [ abs_mag_pairs ] ) .",
    "now that we ensure that the population of lsb and hsb pairs are comparable , we can search for trends between the star - forming parameters and the environment properties , such as the local density .",
    "the upper panels of figures [ b ] and [ b_dn4_rp ] show the distributions of the birthrate parameter @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ b ] ) and the d@xmath264000 index ( fig .",
    "[ b_dn4_rp ] ) , for the sample of pairs and the control sample .",
    "both distributions are defined above ( respectively , below for fig .",
    "[ b_dn4_rp ] ) a threshold value from which we can naturally define those systems with a high star - forming activity ( respectively , very recently formed stars for fig .",
    "[ b_dn4_rp ] ) . in this case",
    "we choose pairs with @xmath67 and d@xmath264000 @xmath68 .",
    "these systems , clearly with star - forming processes and/or recently formed stars , are worth to be characterized in terms of the projected distance to the closest neighbor @xmath45 , normalized by the petrosian radius @xmath3 .",
    "results can be observed in lower panels of figures [ b ] and [ b_dn4_rp ] , where we plot the average birthrate parameter @xmath4 and the d@xmath264000 index as a function of the @xmath69 ratio .",
    "the blue dot - dashed lines represent the corresponding fractions and averages for the control sample for both groups of galaxies .",
    "note that in these two figures , both the fractions and averages are weighted by @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ b ] shows an increase in the stellar formation activity for hsbgs compared to the corresponding control sample .",
    "this is in agreement with previous works ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . regarding the lsbgs , both the control sample of lsbgs and the lsbgs with pairs , exhibit a significant fraction of galaxies with star forming processes ( around 30% )",
    "this increases even more for pairs with @xmath70 , where the fraction of star - forming galaxies doubles , to reach up to 60% , which represents a large value when compared to that for the control sample .",
    "note that for the average birthrate parameter @xmath4 , @xmath71 , we observe an increment in the first bin of @xmath69 , twice as large as the increment in the same bin observed for the lsbg pair sample .",
    "this behavior is mainly due to the fact that the @xmath4 distribution for the hsb galaxies dominates for @xmath72 , which _ is not _ the case for the lsb galaxies ( then the difference in the @xmath71 value for hsbgs and lsbgs ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the increase of the star formation signatures described above is consistent with the fraction of young stars from the d@xmath264000 index distribution ( figure [ b_dn4_rp ] ) .",
    "both samples of galaxies ( lsbgs and hsbgs ) , exhibit an increase in the fraction of galaxies having recent star formation episodes , when @xmath69 decreases , in comparison with the corresponding control samples ( the horizontal blue dot - dashed lines ) . the smaller average values of @xmath73d@xmath74 for lsbgs compared to hsbgs for @xmath75 , indicate that lsbgs in average have _ younger _ stellar populations than hsbgs at large separation scales .",
    "in fact , results show that in average , the fraction of young stars in lsbgs is roughly similar for all scales .",
    "note that for both lsbgs and hsbgs the average value for d@xmath264000 is smaller than the corresponding value for the control sample .",
    "there are several reasons for devoting special attention to the fraction of lsbgs which host agn activity .",
    "first , the evolution of an agn can alter the evolution of the entire galaxy ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "second , it has been claimed @xcite that the bulge size can be related to the metallicity , where smaller bulges are metal poor , favoring a secular evolution picture for the case of some barred spiral lsbgs and clearly appealing to the mass metallicity relationship in non - barred spirals @xcite .",
    "concerning the fraction of lsbgs hosting agns , @xcite found that _",
    "half _ of his sample of 10 giant lsbgs exhibit agns .",
    "the same fraction was also found by @xcite .",
    "these rather high fractions were challenged by @xcite , who found that only 5% of their lsb sample , selected from the automated plate measuring machine survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* apm ) , hosted agns .",
    "finally , @xcite , using 194 lsbgs from the spectroscopic catalog of @xcite , along with spectroscopic information from the sdss dr 5 , concluded that 10%-20% of the lsbgs host an agn , to be compared to the 40%-50% of hsbgs presenting an agn .",
    "the luminosity of the bulge has also an important role in the fraction of spirals with an agn .",
    "@xcite using a sample of galaxies with high hi emission concluded that the occurrence of agn was highest in systems with bulges , regardless of morphological type or mean surface brightness .",
    "however , the existence of a stellar population ( and the associated gravitational gradient ) appears to be a prerequisite for an active nuclear region .",
    "this evidence points to other results indicating that the bulge and disk evolution are decoupled and so whatever star formation processes produced the bulges did not affect the disks @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above , we devote attention to the hsbgs and lsbgs hosting an agn .",
    "the sample of galaxies hosting an agn , for both samples containing lsbgs and hsbgs , was obtained using the @xcite catalog , using the well - known bpt diagnosis diagram @xcite from the intensity of the [ oiii]@xmath765007 , h@xmath77 , [ nii]@xmath766583 and h@xmath78 lines . following the bpt diagram ,",

    "also exhibit an agn . in rough numbers",
    "then , 19% of the hsbgs present an agn , compared to the 5% of the lsbgs having an agn .",
    "figure [ histo_agn ] shows the fraction of hsbgs and lsbgs in our sample presenting agns , as a function of the redshift , the absolute magnitude in the @xmath19-band , the log of the stellar mass , and the petrosian radius @xmath3 in kpc .",
    "both in the hsb and lsb galaxies , we observe that the redshift distributions _ and _ the absolute magnitude distributions for both lsbgs and hsbgs are similar .",
    "this is expected since both agns and lsbgs are detected in the brightest portion of absolute magnitude range . a similar distribution is also observed in the stellar mass distribution for both the lsbgs and hsbgs having agns ( left bottom panel ) . where things are clearly different is in the size distribution of hsbgs and lsbgs having an agn ( right bottom panel ) .",
    "although both distributions are similar in shape , lsbgs hosting an agn are larger , in average , than the hsb counterparts .",
    "also , when comparing @xmath3 between figure [ histo_agn ] and figure [ gen_props ] ( or figure [ gen_props_corrected ] ) , it is worth noting that both lsbgs and hsbgs hosting an agn are _ smaller _ in average than the counterparts lacking an agn .",
    "we suggest that the presence of an agn could be responsible for this difference observed statistically . in figure [ color_ambas ]",
    "we compare the color properties of lsbgs and hsbgs with and without agn , via the @xmath80 vs. @xmath81 color - color diagram ( lsbgs in the left panel , and hsbgs in the right panel ) .",
    "black points represent the galaxies without agn and the green points represent galaxies hosting an agn . for both hsbgs and lsbgs ,",
    "galaxies having an agn are in average redder than their counterparts lacking an agn .",
    "the average values for lsbgs having an agn is @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this locates the lsbgs - agn galaxies in the space covered mainly by the red population of lsbgs ( delimited by the red line ) , a region first noted by @xcite , and reinforced by @xcite who show , using near - ir photometry , that a large fraction of lsbgs with high gas fractions host old and red stellar populations .",
    "the fraction of lsbgs and hsbgs with agn , as a function of the absolute magnitude and the log of the stellar mass , is shown in figure [ frac_agn ] .",
    "in agreement with the previous authors already cited , the fraction of lsbgs hosting an agn is always lower than the corresponding fraction of hsbgs also hosting an agn , regardless of the absolute magnitude and the stellar mass .",
    "it is not surprising that both parameters evolve in the same way ( larger fraction of agns for brighter objects and larger masses ) , since both quantities are related via the mass - luminosity relation . as this figure shows , the agn fraction is a steep function of the brightness ( and the mass ) of the galaxy , as observed by many authors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as it has been claimed , this is just another realization that the mass of the black hole ( and then the power of the agn ) , is related to the mass of the galaxy itself ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for the lowest covered masses ( @xmath84 m@xmath36 ) , the fraction of lsbgs hosting an agn is @xmath85 , roughly the same fraction observed for the hsbgs . however , for the larger masses covered by this statistics , the fraction of lsbgs hosting an agn reaches @xmath86 , which is 10% _ lower _ than the corresponding fraction of hsbgs hosting an agn .",
    "these fractions are quite similar when using the absolute magnitude .",
    "why , regardless the stellar mass of a galaxy , the fraction of lsbgs hosting an agn is lower than the fraction of hsbgs having agns ? this may be related to the star formation properties of lsbgs in different environments described in  [ interactinglsbgs ] , a subject we discuss in  [ discussion ] .",
    "regarding the bulge luminosity and the fraction of galaxies with agn , we obtain similar results for the two galaxy populations ( hsbgs and lsbgs ) .",
    "figure [ agn_bulge ] shows the fraction of lsbgs and hsbgs with agn as a function of the parameter used to define the luminosity contribution of the bulge ( i.e. the fracdev parameter ) , represented by a de vaucouleurs luminosity profile .",
    "both distributions are normalized by the total number of galaxies of the same population found in each bin of fracdev .",
    "the black and red lines show the trend for the hsbgs and the lsbgs , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that both fractions increase ( with almost the same slope ) as the bulge dominates the galaxy luminosity , a result in agreement with other works discussed here ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we see also that the hsbg population has a larger fraction of agn compared to lsbg counterparts , in agreement with the fact that the hsbgs host a larger fraction of agn than the lsbg counterparts ( 19% for the hsbgs and 5% for the lsbgs ) . in order to check the morphology of the galaxies with agn , we examined by eye the hsbgs and lsbgs hosting an agn .",
    "both populations show exclusively spiral galaxies with a visible bulge , the lsbgs - agn exhibiting bluer colors than the hsbg - agn population and less prominent bulges ( see figure [ color - agn ] ) . however , the lsbg - agn population has a larger fraction of small bulges .",
    "these galaxies have spectra with less prominent agn signatures compared to those with more luminous bulges .",
    "all this evidence is in agreement with the trend observed in other agns , where there is a close relationship between the bulge luminosity and the power of the agn , represented by the emission line diagnosis .",
    "as argued in the introduction , there is still a debate about the evolution of lsbgs when located in dense environments .",
    "are lsbgs destroyed in dense environments , or they just change their condition of lsbgs , turning into hsbgs ? given that these galaxies dominate the volume density of galaxies @xcite , then having clues to solve this issue is of fundamental importance .",
    "there are basically two different scenarios describing the evolution of an lsbg in dense environments , especially when an lsbg is subject to the direct influence of another galaxy .",
    "the first scenario establish that lsbg disks are unstable under perturbations ( given their low density ) , making lsbgs very sensitive to the local density and hence making them to populate only low density environments . a second scenario , also supported by models ( * ?",
    "* hereafter mmb model ) and observations @xcite , yields _ stable disks against interactions _ , for sufficiently _ low _ stellar mass densities ( @xmath87 ) and assuming large amounts of dark matter , as it is the case for lsbgs . in this picture , below a mass density threshold , perturbations generated by the interactions would be unable to be amplified , preventing the galaxy from being destroyed and/or producing significant star formation episodes .",
    "the net result is a much more stable galaxy against close interactions .",
    "such a stability would be represented , for example , by the lack of bars and the absence of flow of material which can form stars or even feed a central massive black hole ( activating an agn ) .",
    "therefore , the deficit of lsbgs hosting agns , compared to those found in hsbgs , could fit at least with the picture the mmb model presents .",
    "this last picture also fits well , but with a subtlety , with the values of the stellar formation indexes @xmath71 and @xmath73d@xmath264000@xmath88 as a function of the interacting distance @xmath69 , as found for both lsbgs and hsbgs ( figures [ b ] and [ b_dn4_rp ] ) .",
    "when comparing the fraction of lsbgs and hsbgs with the _ highest _ values of @xmath4 ( @xmath67 ) , we realize that these fractions are the same at all scales , for the whole range of @xmath69 ; i.e. , there is no distinction in the star forming properties between lsbgs and hsbgs , where the latter are actively forming stars .",
    "however , when looking at the complete range of @xmath4 , we discover that at smaller scales ( i.e. close interactions , @xmath89 ) , the fraction of hsbgs having stellar formation episodes _",
    "double _ that of lsbgs .",
    "these results could match the two scenarios described above . in one case ,",
    "the lack of lsbgs with high values of @xmath4 ( significant stellar formation episodes ) points to the possibility that such galaxies could no longer be lsbgs , having evolved to a higher surface brightness regime . on the other hand , following the mmb model , the difference in the interaction signature could be explained by the disk stability , preventing lsbgs from changing their star formation rate , as it is observed in hsbgs .",
    "thus , our results support the picture where lsbgs are more isolated than hsbgs at large scales , a result in agreement with those by @xcite",
    ". however , more than the local density value , are the interactions with close neighbors which actually make lsbgs evolve .",
    "interestingly , when this occurs , lsbgs seem to be more stable than hsbgs , preventing lsbgs to change significantly their stellar formation signatures as usually expected with respect to hsbgs with close companions .",
    "this last behavior , together with the lower fraction of lsbgs with agns compared to the fraction of hsbgs also hosting agns ( for the full mass range ) , could be explained by the difficulty shown by interacting lsbgs to form bars , lacking the natural bridge which transports material to the center of the galaxy , preventing the central black hole from being fueled , and then remaining the galaxy as a non - agn .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows .    * for a sample of 9,421 lsb galaxies selected from the sdss dr 4 ( 1.66% of a total of 567,486 galaxies ) , in the redshift range @xmath90 , the cumulative distributions of the distance to the nearest and the fifth closest neighbors , indicate that lsbgs are more isolated than high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs ) . also , lsbgs specially avoid high density environments , i.e. are almost completely _ unpopular _ , following the @xcite terminology .",
    "when describing the degree of isolation in terms of the surface density of galaxies , our results yield a deficit of neighbors for lsbgs at small scales ( @xmath731 mpc ) . for larger scales",
    "( @xmath91 mpc ) , we obtain consistent fractions of lsbgs and hsbgs .",
    "this is in fairly good agreement with results by @xcite .",
    "however , we do not detect a higher degree of isolation of lsbgs in the scale range 2 - 5 mpc as these authors do .",
    "this difference can be explained by the different galaxy selection criteria , as most of our galaxies are spirals , losing some spirals with extremely bright bulges _ and _ faint disks , as well as faint irregulars ( @xmath28 mag ) , and rosenbaum s low redshift ones are mostly dwarfs . *",
    "the fraction of lsbgs with high stellar formation signatures and/or a high population of recently formed stars , increases when galaxies are close to a neighbor ( @xmath70 ) , and is clearly larger when compared to a sample of isolated lsbgs .",
    "this behavior is similar in hsbgs also suffering interactions .",
    "however , when comparing the average value of the stellar formation signature ( e.g. the birthrate parameter @xmath4 ) , interacting hsbgs form _",
    "twice _ the stars as the interacting lsbgs .",
    "this last difference could be explained by models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mmp models ) , which show the difficulty of low density stellar disks ( i.e. low surface brightness disks ) surrounded by significant dark matter haloes , to amplify and propagate perturbations due to close companions . * the fraction of lsbgs hosting an agn is lower than the fraction of hsbgs with agns .",
    "5% of the lsbgs host an agn , compared to the 19% of the hsb systems .",
    "these two fractions are in agreement to those found by @xcite .",
    "this is systematic for the whole range of masses covered in this work ( i.e. for the whole range of absolute magnitudes of the volume - limited sample , @xmath92 ) .",
    "this could be explained by the difficulty of lsbgs to react under close companions ( mmp models ) , which would produce a deficit of bars and other structures in lsbgs capable to transport material to activate the massive central black hole , which when active , would generate an agn .",
    "another interesting result is obtained when the frequency of an agn is compared between the lsbg and hsbg populations , in terms of the bulge optical luminosity .",
    "we obtain that for both the hsbg and the lsbg populations , the fraction of agns increases with the bulge luminosity with almost the same slope , in agreement with other authors .",
