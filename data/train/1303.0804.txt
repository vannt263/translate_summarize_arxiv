    "since the successful fabricating of graphene in 2004 ,  @xcite its excellent transport properties ,  @xcite such as the exceptional electron and thermal transport properties at room temperature , have attracted a lot of research interest to apply it in making future electronic devices .",
    "@xcite many ideas and attempts have been going on .",
    "one of the most fundamental and revolutionary attempts is to control the valley degree of freedom to realize the signal s storage and transport.@xcite supposed an achievement of this idea in future , graphene will probably replace all semiconductors in conventional electronics and bring a new era in many fields . before the coming of the new era , there is a long way to improve the control over transport in graphene .    inspired by the crucial role of the doping in semiconductor ,",
    "many researchers have studied the effects related to disorder in graphene,@xcite which consists of adsorbed atoms ( or molecules ) , charged impurities , vacancies , or other topological defects .",
    "it is anticipated to modify the transport property of pristine graphene to fulfill the requirement .",
    "recently , a peculiar topological line - defect in graphene was reported experimentally by lahiri et al .",
    "@xcite this topological line - defect is created by alternating the stone - thrower - wales defect and divacancies , leading to a pattern of repeating paired pentagons and octagons , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in particular",
    ", it is found in this experiment that this line - defect has metallic characteristics .",
    "great attention has been attracted to the line - defect and further investigations manifest a variety of its promising applications.@xcite    although a lot of theoretic proposals are presented in graphene to realize the valley filter before , all of them are not realized till now due to the extreme difficulty in the experimental implementation . after the discover of line - defect , gunlycke and white  @xcite reported that a valley polarization near @xmath0 can be achieved by scattering off a line - defect.@xcite this original idea subsequently arouse physics community s intensive interests.@xcite as a new discovery",
    ", the extended line - defect is very promising to realize the valley polarization in graphene .",
    "however , because the @xmath0 valley polarization only maintains at a large incident angle in these reported results.@xcite a serious problem will be encountered in experiment that the electron must always follow the direction of the line - defect to maintain a high valley polarization .",
    "this transport characteristic is almost fatal to utilize efficiently the high valley polarization .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address a feasible approach to realize a @xmath0 valley polarization at a small incident angle by using a resonator , which consists of several paralleling line - defects .    given a high valley polarization by scattering off one line - defect , a question is putted forward naturally : what will happen in the presence of two or more line - defects ? motivated by finding an efficient realization of the high valley polarization , we therefore study the electron transmission coefficient in the presence of several line - defects .",
    "intriguingly , it is found that an obvious change happens to the transmission coefficients with varying the distance between two line - defects .",
    "in particular , for the electron with a definite momentum and incident angle , the transmission coefficients can reach to one at a definite distance between two line - defects .",
    "simple numerical analysis argues that the large transmission coefficients should be attributed to the standing wave structure due to the electron s quantum interference , which is also named as fabry - p@xmath1rot interference in optics .",
    "based on a further numerical simulation , an efficient device to realize a @xmath0 valley polarization is further proposed for six line - defect configuration at the end .",
    "this fascinating finding opens a way to realize the valley polarization by line - defects .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we introduce the hamiltonian in the tight - binding model and present the formula of the transmission coefficient . the numerical results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussions ] .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the tight - binding approximation , a single layer of graphene with a line - defect , sketched in fig .",
    "1(a ) , can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the electron annihilation operators on the graphene site @xmath5 and line - defect sites , respectively , and @xmath6 refers to the nearest neighboring sites .",
    "supposed a variation less than @xmath7 in the hopping terms @xmath8 and @xmath9,@xcite here we adopt @xmath10 .",
    "is from the fourier transformation along y axis . ]    because of the existence of line - defect , the translation symmetry along @xmath11 axis breaks down for a graphene system , as sketched in fig .",
    "however , the translation symmetry along @xmath12 axis still retains and therefore @xmath13 is a good quantum number , namely a conserved quantity . for the sake of the convenience in computing , we do the fourier transform only along @xmath12 axis as follows : @xmath14 @xmath15 represents the lattice constant in pristine graphene . after the fourier transformation , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) is decoupled into @xmath16 .",
    "note that here @xmath17 can be effectively represented by a quasi - one - dimensional lattice model , as shown in fig .",
    "readily , we can describe the hamiltonian @xmath17 as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 $ ] , and @xmath21 represents the unit length between the neighboring supercells at the graphene part . here",
    ", @xmath22 represent the position of a supercell , @xmath23 takes the integer number from 1 to 4 to denote the different columns in a supercell , and @xmath24 in @xmath25 corresponds to the up / down site in the same column in fig .",
    "1(c ) .     or @xmath26 dirac cone .",
    "( b ) the relationship between the electron s incident angle and momentums .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) manifest the transmission coefficient in @xmath27 and @xmath26 valleys . in this case , there is only one line - defect . here",
    ", the dotted line represents the approximate result in the low energy limit : @xmath28    according to the landauer - bttiker formula and the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) , the transmission coefficient of the line - defect system at zero temperature and low bias voltage can be represented as :  @xcite @xmath29},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the retarded / advanced green s function related to the line - defect hamiltonian and @xmath31 with the retarded / advanced self - energy @xmath32 .",
    "note that here the left / right lead is represented by a semi - infinite quasi - one - dimensional graphene lattice sketched in fig .",
    "1(c ) and the sample hamiltonian refers to the line - defect hamiltonian , namely @xmath33 .",
    "( b ) and @xmath26 ( c ) are mapped as a function of the incident angle @xmath23 in the presence of two line - defects . here",
    ", electron s energy is set as @xmath34 . ]",
    "it is worth noting that we can readily compute the transmission coefficients of the electron with a fixed incident angle @xmath23 in two dirac points , @xmath27 and @xmath26 , by using the above formula . as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , two dirac points @xmath27 and @xmath26 which are located at @xmath35 $ ] for a pristine graphene are now cast at @xmath36 and @xmath37 for a graphene with a line - defect , @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "therefore , an electron in two valleys satisfies the following relations : @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents electron s group velocity along the @xmath42 direction .",
    "combined with the dirac electron s linear dispersion relation @xmath43 , the transmission coefficients can be readily mapped as a function of the electron incident angle @xmath23,@xcite where @xmath44 . for simplicity in discussing",
    ", we will never distinguish the difference of the dirac points in two brillouin zones in the following and uniformly adopt @xmath27 and @xmath26 to represent the two nonequivalent dirac points .",
    "besides , some previous papers reported that in the vicinity of the dirac point , the transmission coefficient of low energy electron will obey the law : @xmath45 . in order to make this work essentially self - contained",
    ", we also confirm this conclusion and present the related derivations in appendix .",
    "even though the transmission coefficient in the vicinity of the dirac point was given by an approximated method in many references,@xcite to the best of our knowledge , the exact numerical calculation without any analytical approximations is not unambiguously shown before . given the realization of the valley polarization using the line - defect in future , what the transmission coefficient behaviors at a relatively large energy is a fundamental question .    in fig .",
    "2 , the transmission coefficient is mapped as a function of the electron s incident angle for different energies .",
    "it can be observed the line of @xmath46 ( red ) overlaps exactly with the dotted line , @xmath47 , which represents the transmission coefficient of low energy electron in the vicinity of the dirac point by an approximate method and is also given in appendix .",
    "one subtle difference between the numerical and approximate results is zero transmission probability nearby @xmath48 for exact numerical result .",
    "however , this physical observation is not manifested in the approximate result ( dotted line ) . a severe deviation from the dotted line",
    "is clearly seen for the lines with @xmath49 , which indicates that a excellent valley transmission can only be maintained at not very large energy .",
    "( left ) and @xmath26 ( right ) valleys . in this case",
    ", two line - defects are considered and the fixed distance between them is @xmath50 . ]",
    "the search of the valley polarization material or device attracts physics community greatly .",
    "although a proposal was given recently by scattering off a line - defect,@xcite it looks much difficult for graphene with only one line - defect to make electron leave away from the line - defect and finally reach the key device , and meanwhile maintain at a high valley polarization in this process .",
    "inspired by the valley polarization in the line - defect graphene , we expect this problem can be resolved by scattering off two or several line - defects .    in fig .",
    "3 , the transmission behavior is mapped as a function of the incident angle in the presence of two line - defects .",
    "3(a ) shows a lattice model of graphene with two line - defects and meanwhile presents a schematic interpretation of @xmath51 which represents the distance between two nearest neighbouring line - defects . using the formula ( 4 ) ,",
    "the transmission coefficients in the @xmath27 and @xmath26 valleys are mapped as a function of the incident angle in fig 3(b ) and 3(c ) .",
    "a mirror symmetry with respect to @xmath52 can be seen clearly between them . comparing to the case of one line - defect",
    ", there is almost no distinct change for the lines of @xmath53 both in fig .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) .",
    "however , the transmission coefficient starts varying for @xmath54 and in particular some transmission peaks can be observed obviously at small incident angles for the lines of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this exciting finding makes us fascinated to explore what happens to the two - line - defect graphene and why there is a high transmission probability at some incident angles .     which is exactly the green circle path in fig .",
    "4 . two lines ( blue and red ) correspond to that of @xmath27 and @xmath26 valleys , respectively . in this case , two line - defects are considered and the fixed distance between them is @xmath50 . ]    in order to demonstrate a whole physical picture , we map the transmission coefficient as the function of @xmath57 in fig .",
    "the left and right maps , which correspond to the @xmath27 and @xmath26 valleys , respectively , manifest a clear symmetry .",
    "intriguingly , two large transmission regions ( dark red ) can be observed both in the @xmath27 and @xmath26 valleys .",
    "note that the positive ( negative ) @xmath58 represents an incident electron along positive x direction ( negative x direction ) .",
    "these peaks remind us some quantum interferences occur in the presence of two line - defects , e.g. electron s resonant tunneling phenomena .",
    "to confirm the origin of the high transmission above , we plot two lines selectively in fig .",
    "these two lines which belong to @xmath27 and @xmath26 valleys respectively correspond to half circle of the green route in fig .",
    "4 , representing @xmath59 . obviously , the transmission peaks at @xmath60 and @xmath61 are from the intersection of the green circle route and the high transmission region ( dark red ) . when substituting @xmath62 and @xmath63 into the formula : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we find two quantities are equivalent within the physical error range .",
    "this is to say , the @xmath0 transmission does originate from the resonant tunneling , which is often observed in the system of quantum dot.@xcite     valley is given in the presence of several paralleling line - defects : ( a ) @xmath66 , ( b ) @xmath67 , ( c ) @xmath68 , and ( d ) @xmath69 .",
    "note that here @xmath70 represents the number of paralleling line - defects . in each case , four lines with differen @xmath71 , the distance of two nearest neighbouring line - defects , are manifested . here",
    ", electron s energy is set as @xmath34 ]    according to the quantum theory of wave - particle duality , the low energy electron in the vicinity of the dirac point is inclined to exhibit undulation characteristics . when scattering off two line - defects , a standing wave state between two line - defects helps electron resonantly tunnel through the barriers of the line - defects .",
    "consequently , we can observe this perfect transmission phenomenon in above figures .",
    "using the valley polarization formula @xmath73 , the @xmath0 valley polarization can not be realized at very small incident angle in the presence of two line - defects , e.g. at the positions of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 peaks .",
    "nevertheless , an exciting thing is that @xmath0 valley polarization can almost be reached when @xmath23 takes the value of @xmath74 $ ] , a relatively small incident angle . at least , the results argue that the high valley transmission at a small incident angle is feasible by scattering off two line - defects .",
    "( left ) and @xmath26 ( right ) valleys . in this case",
    ", six line - defects are considered and the fixed distance between arbitrary two neighboring line - defects is @xmath75 . ]      inspired by the above results , we expect an excellent case could occur to the graphene with several line - defects . in fig . 6 ,",
    "the transmission coefficient only in @xmath27 valley is shown in the presence of several paralleling line - defects : ( a ) @xmath66 , ( b ) @xmath67 , ( c ) @xmath68 , and ( d ) @xmath69 , where @xmath70 represents the number of paralleling line - defects . in fig .",
    "6(a ) with @xmath66 , almost no obvious change can be observed with comparison to the case of @xmath76 in fig .",
    "nevertheless , one extra transmission peak still appears in the line of @xmath55 ( red ) . without question",
    ", it should be attributed to the effect of multiple interference between line - defects . when setting @xmath67 in fig .",
    "6(b ) , except @xmath77 , the transmission coefficients of all other lines become active and manifest some peaks at some fixed incident angles . for the cases of @xmath68 in fig .",
    "6(c ) and @xmath69 in fig .",
    "6(d ) , more transmission peaks appears and overlap each other .",
    "however , the electron transmission coefficient in case of @xmath77 decreases gradually with increasing the number of paralleling line - defects .",
    "it is because at @xmath34 electron s wave length is considerably larger than the distance of two nearest neighbouring line - defects , @xmath77 .    for sake of concreteness",
    ", here we restrict to the case of six line - defects and make great efforts to manifest clearly a picture of a @xmath0 valley polarization . in fig .",
    "7 , the transmission coefficients in two valleys are mapped in the panel of @xmath78 .",
    "it is clearly shown that comparing to the case of two line - defects , more large transmission regions ( dark red ) exist in fig .",
    "7 , the case of six line - defects . as explained in fig . 4 and 5",
    ", these high transmission regions should likewise be from the resonant tunneling due to the quantum interference , which is also named as fabry - p@xmath1rot interference in optics .    in fig .",
    "8 , the transmission coefficient is plotted as a function of the incident angle @xmath23 , which follows half of the green path in fig .",
    "note that here the electron momentum @xmath79 is taken as @xmath80 .",
    "obviously , the marking a , b , and c transmission peaks should be attributed to the three intersections between the green path and the large transmission regions ( dark red ) in fig . 7 . here ,",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 illustrate that the a transmission peak is attributed to the intrinsic scattering property of a line - defect and the peaks at b and c are from the resonant tunneling of the positive and negative first standing waves , respectively .    much importantly ,",
    "not only a perfectly resonant transmission but also a @xmath0 polarization can be obtained at the @xmath84 resonant peak by the polarization formula : @xmath73 . in a conclusion , we predict that the perfect @xmath0 polarization can be achieved by scattering off many line - defects , which origins in the quantum resonant tunneling phenomenon . even though only exhibiting the cases of two and six line - defects here , in principle this high transmission and thus the @xmath0 polarization can be realized in graphene with arbitrary number of line - defects .",
    "this feature shed a light on constructing a feasible valley polarization resonator by using multiple line - defects .     which is exactly the green circle path in fig .",
    "two lines ( blue and red ) correspond to that of @xmath27 and @xmath27 valleys , respectively . in this case , six line - defects are considered and the fixed distance between arbitrary two neighboring line - defects is @xmath75 . ]",
    "in summary , we study the valley polarization in the presence of several paralleling line - defects .",
    "importantly , the valley polarization changes with varying the distance between the line - defects and the number of the line - defects .",
    "in particular , the valley polarization can reach to the maximum value of one , namely a 100@xmath85 polarization , at a small incident angle .",
    "further numerical calculations manifest that @xmath0 polarization should be attributed to the behavior of electron quantum interference , more precisely the phenomenon of the standing wave between the line - defects .",
    "the findings make us get rid of helplessness in the choose of the electron s incident angle and provides a reliable way to realize a controllable valley polarization in experiment . with the great advance in graphene related technologies , a valley polarization resonator and also a detector of a valley polarization , being the key components in valleytronics , are promising to be realized in the system of the line - defect graphene .    in the preparation of this paper",
    ", we notice a reference on two paralleling line - defect in recent@xcite and intriguingly , nearly a perfect perfect valley polarization is also observed .",
    "this report also illustrates that the valley filter of several paralleling line - defects should feasible in experiment .",

    "that can be solved by the surface green s function . in the following ,",
    "we firstly present an analytic method of obtaining the surface green s function @xmath91 and then derive the transmission coefficient of low energy electron in the vicinity of the dirac point .    based on the schematic representation in fig .",

    "note that the green s function must be diagonalized if all coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ a6 ] ) , namely all @xmath121 , can be diagonalized by this unitary transformation .",
    "there are many known mathematic method to calculate an inverse matrix of a tridiagonal matrix .",

    "<S> the electron transport of different conical valleys is investigated in graphene with extended line - defects . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the electron with a definite incident angle can be completely modulated into one conical valley by a resonator which consists of several paralleling line - defects . </S>",
    "<S> the related incident angle can be controlled easily by tuning the parameters of the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a controllable @xmath0 valley polarization , as well as the detection of the valley polarization , can be realized conveniently by tuning the number of line - defects and the distance between two nearest neighbouring line - defects . </S>",
    "<S> this fascinating finding opens a way to realize the valley polarization by line - defects . with the advancement of experimental technologies , this resonator is promising to be realized and thus plays a key role in graphene valleytronics . </S>"
