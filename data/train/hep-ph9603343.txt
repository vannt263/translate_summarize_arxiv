    "the standard model ( sm ) has been tested to an unprecedent degree of accuracy of @xmath4 in some of the physical observables at lep1 , with many implications to physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath5pole experiments are able to probe with great precision just the fermionic couplings to the vector bosons while furnishing very little information about the interaction between the gauge bosons and the higgs sector of the sm . in principle",
    ", it is conceivable that the interactions of the higgs boson , which is responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry and for generating fermion masses , are different from those prescribed by the sm . in this case",
    ", an effective lagrangian formalism can be used to describe possible anomalous interactions between the higgs boson and the vector bosons .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach is a convenient model ",
    "indepent parametrization of the low  energy effects of new physics beyond the sm that may show up at higher energies @xcite .",
    "effective lagrangians , employed to study processes at a typical energy scale @xmath6 , can be written as a power series in @xmath7 , where the scale @xmath8 is associated with the new particle masses belonging to the underlying theory .",
    "the coefficients of the different terms in the effective lagrangian arise from integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom that are characteristic of a particular model for new physics .",
    "invariant amplitudes , generated by such lagrangians , will be an expansion in @xmath9 , and in practice one can only consider the first few terms of the effective lagrangian , _",
    "e.g. _ dimension six operators , which are dominant for @xmath10 .",
    "the anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings have already been considered in @xmath5 and higgs decays @xcite , in @xmath11 collisions @xcite and at @xmath12 colliders @xcite . in this paper , we concentrate our analyses on the effect of anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings , described by a general effective lagrangian , on the process @xmath13 .",
    "this is a very interesting reaction since the sm contribution to @xmath14 , being a one loop process , is extremelly small , and the observation of any @xmath15 event at lep2 will be a clear signal of new physics .",
    "it may also be the only possibility of detecting a higgs boson with mass larger than @xmath16 gev at lep2 , provided that the anomalous couplings are sufficiently large . in our calculation , we include the dominant decay of the higgs boson into a pair of bottom and anti  bottom quarks in the framework of a complete tree  level calculation of the process @xmath17 involving both the sm and the anomalous higgs boson couplings . in this way",
    ", the irreducible sm background to the new physics is taken into account .",
    "furthermore , we employ the photon energy spectrum to identify the existence of the anomalous higgs boson or at least impose further bounds on its effective couplings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff ] , we review the use of effective lagrangians to study anomalous higgs boson couplings , including limits on these couplings arising from precision measurements . in sec .  [",
    "sec : pro ] , we study the process @xmath18 , and we present our results and trace our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : res : con ] .",
    "in order to define an effective lagrangian , it is necessary to specify the symmetry and the particle content of the low  energy theory . in our case , we require the effective lagrangian to be cp  conserving , invariant under the sm symmetry @xmath19 and to have as fundamental fields the same ones appearing in the sm spectrum .",
    "in particular , the higgs field will be manifest and the symmetry is realized linearly .",
    "there are eleven independent dimension - six operators @xcite of which only five are relevant for our discussions .",
    "following the notation of reference @xcite , we can write , @xmath20 \\ ; ,   \\label{eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the higgs field doublet , which in the unitary gauge assumes the form , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the field strength tensors of the respective @xmath26 and @xmath27 gauge fields .    this lagrangian gives rise to the following anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings , in the unitary gauge @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and the coupling constants @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are related to the coefficients of the operators appearing in ( [ lagr ] ) through , @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the electroweak coupling constant , and @xmath34 .    the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be related to triple vector boson anomalous couplings and are bounded , for instance , by the direct measurement of @xmath37 vertex at hadron colliders .",
    "however , more stringent bounds on the coefficients of the effective lagrangian ( [ eff ] ) come from the precision measurements of the electroweak parameters obtained at lep1 @xcite .",
    "typically one has that @xmath38 can be as large as @xmath39 tev@xmath40 , whereas @xmath41 should be at most @xmath42 tev@xmath40 .",
    "an interesting option to test the couplings described by ( [ h ] ) at lep2 is via the reaction @xmath44 , with the subsequent decay of the higgs boson into a @xmath45 pair . in the sm , at tree - level , there are eight feynman diagrams that contribute to the process @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]@xmath46  @xmath47 ) .    a sm higgs boson contribution to",
    "this process appears only at one  loop level , and is extremely small .",
    "for instance , the total cross setion for the process @xmath44 @xcite , at @xmath48 gev , varies from @xmath49 fb to @xmath50 fb , for the higgs mass in the range @xmath51 gev .",
    "therefore , with the expected lep2 luminosity , no such events should be seen . even in the minimal supersymmetric standard model",
    ", one can not expect an enhancement larger than a factor of @xmath52 with respect to the sm result @xcite . in this way",
    ", we neglect this loop contribution in our calculation .",
    "the bulk of the sm cross section comes from the @xmath5 boson contribution to the diagrams @xmath46 ",
    "@xmath53 when the @xmath5 boson is on - mass - shell , and the process is effectively a @xmath54-body one .",
    "this implies that the majority of the photons emitted are monochromatic , with energy given by @xmath55 .",
    "when we take into account the anomalous higgs boson couplings described above , two additional diagrams should be considered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](e ) ) .",
    "their contributions are dominated by the on  mass  shell @xmath56 production , with @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we can anticipate the existence of a a secondary peak in the photon energy spectrum , generated at an energy @xmath58 which would be a very clear signal for the higgs boson .    in order to evaluate the total cross section and kinematical distributions for the process",
    "@xmath18 , we have used the package madgraph @xcite coupled to dhelas , the double precision version of helas @xcite , for generating the tree ",
    "level sm amplitudes .",
    "we have written the relevant subroutines for the higgs anomalous couplings , and included in the madgraph generated file the two additional anomalous amplitudes . in this way",
    ", all interference effects between the sm and the anomalous amplitudes were taken into account .",
    "we checked for electromagnetic gauge invariance of the whole invariant amplitude , and incorporated a three  body phase space code , based on @xcite . since the higgs boson resonance is very narrow , @xmath59 mev , for @xmath60 gev , we make sure to use appropriate variables to take care of the higgs events close to the resonance peak . finally , we used vegas @xcite to perform the phase space integration .",
    "in our analyses we have assumed a center  of  mass energy of @xmath61 gev for the lep2 collider , with a luminosity of @xmath62 fb@xmath63 .",
    "our results were obtained using the following energy and angular cuts , @xmath64 ) is intended to reject the background from unresolved pair of photons from @xmath65 decays and assures , in principle , a sensitivity to @xmath66 up to @xmath3 gev .",
    "the cuts in @xmath67 and @xmath68 were introduced to reduce initial and final state radiation , respectively .",
    "our purpose is to determine the range of anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings that could be probed at lep2 by searching for a signal of the higgs boson in the process @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the higgs couplings to fermions are the standard ones , which makes the @xmath69 dominant in the range @xmath51 gev , for @xmath70 tev@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows our _ typical _ results for the photon energy distribution presented as a @xmath71 gev bin histogram .",
    "we have taken @xmath72 gev@xmath63 , @xmath73 and varied the higgs mass between 70 and 120 gev .",
    "we should point out that the general behavior of the energy distribution remains the same when we consider the other couplings , @xmath74 , different from zero .",
    "we can identify the @xmath5boson peak around @xmath75 gev and also the various secondary peaks due to the higgs boson at the energies given by ( [ ehiggs ] ) .",
    "we can notice that the smaller the higgs mass , the larger is its effect in the @xmath76 distribution .",
    "its detectability should rely on a careful analyses of the tail ( in the case where @xmath77 ) of the sm contribution to the photon energy spectrum in the process @xmath78 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , for the sake of comparison between the signal ( @xmath79 ) and background ( @xmath5 ) behavior , we present separately the normalized angular distribution for sm and anomalous contributions , for @xmath72 gev@xmath63 , and @xmath80 gev .",
    "we consider the angles between the electron beam and the final particles ( @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) , and also the ones between the final particles ( @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ) .",
    "we can see that the signal has a very small contribution at @xmath85 , due to the scalar nature of the higgs , whereas the events from the background yields some events from transversal @xmath5 s in the central region .",
    "the @xmath84 angular distribution shows that the produced quarks have a minimum angle between themselves , which dependes on the mass and energy of the parent particle , _ i.e. _ @xmath86 .",
    "this variable could be used to further increase the signal over background ratio .",
    "for instance , for @xmath87 , the cut @xmath88 is able to get ride of most of the @xmath89 events coming from the @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , at the z peak , the number of events is reduced by a factor of 3 when this cut is implemented for a higgs boson of 110 gev . on the other hand , for @xmath90 , a cut",
    "@xmath91 plays the same role .",
    "we should point out that there is no difference among the distributions coming from the three anomalous couplings ( [ g ] ) .",
    "therefore , it will be very difficult to make a distinction among these couplings based only on these kinematical distributions @xcite .    in order to estimate the reach of lep2 to disentangle the anomalous higgs boson couplings ,",
    "we have evaluated the significance ( @xmath92 ) of the signal based on the higgs boson peaks in the @xmath76 distribution , assuming a poisson distribution for both signal and background .",
    "we have scanned the parameter space for the three anomalous couplings keeping only one non ",
    "zero coupling in each run , for different values of the higgs boson mass .",
    "we took the coupling constants @xmath30 , @xmath93 in the range @xmath94 gev@xmath63 @xcite , and we assumed a @xmath95tagging efficiency of 68% @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we present the significance for each of these couplings , assuming four different values of the higgs boson mass @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 gev .",
    "we should notice that for @xmath100 gev the signifance is reduced due to the presence of the @xmath5 boson peak .    in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] , we show the values of the coupling constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 that corresponds to a @xmath101 effect in the 1 gev bin of the @xmath76 distribution around the higgs peaks , for different higgs boson masses .",
    "we also present the total number of signal and background events in these bins .",
    "for @xmath100 gev , a large numbers of events is needed due to the @xmath5 boson peak .",
    "since the signal increases with the square of the anomalous couplings , for some values of the coupling constants , we could expect to have a reliable signal for the anomalous higgs boson in less than one year of lep2 run .    in this study ,",
    "we have not taken into account initial state radiation , which would result in an energy degradation of the original @xmath11 beams , and we have not included a realistic simulation of the electromagnetic energy resolution .",
    "it is important to notice that an increase in the @xmath95tagging efficiency , and a good resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter can help to select the @xmath89 events , increasing the signal over background ratio and improving the resolution of the higgs boson peak in the photon energy distribution .    in conclusion ,",
    "searching for the anomalous higgs at lep2 provides a complementary way to the indirect precision measurements at lep1 in probing effective lagrangians that are the low  energy limit of physics beyond the sm .",
    "we have shown that the study of the process @xmath18 can be a very important tool in the search of these particles at lep2 .",
    "we found that anomalous couplings @xmath30 , @xmath102 gev@xmath63 are necessary for identifying an anomalous higgs of @xmath3 gev .",
    "however , for a lighter higgs boson , couplings as small as @xmath103 gev@xmath63 should suffice .    we would like to thank o.  j.  p.  boli for useful discussions .",
