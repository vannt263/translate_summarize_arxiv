    "the latest property implies that every @xmath683 is covered by a unique @xmath48 , and every @xmath684 is covered by a unique @xmath47 , so @xmath685 is 2-regular , on 9 vertices , we obtain the grid @xmath677 .    in the case of @xmath686 ,",
    "say @xmath687 and @xmath688 we have that @xmath689 is a singleton and it must be the same element as @xmath690 .",
    "taking into the account that @xmath685 is 3-partite we obtain that it is isomorphic to @xmath673 when @xmath627 and @xmath691 are disjoint , and it is isomorphic to @xmath672 when @xmath627 and @xmath691 meet .",
    "finally , in the case @xmath692 , say @xmath688 , the other four sets meet @xmath691 in exactly one element , so there is a vertex @xmath108 of @xmath691 of degree at least @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath693 then @xmath694 and @xmath695 covers @xmath696 and we could not finish because @xmath697 is 3-partite .",
    "similarly , if @xmath698 then @xmath699 must be covered by @xmath694 , a contradiction .",
    "so if the three configurations are avoided then @xmath18 is 3-union - free .    *",
    "proof of proposition  [ pr:10 ] .",
    "* the probabilistic lower bound from lemma [ le : erdos ] and the previous lemma imply the lower bound ( [ eq : u3 ] ) @xmath700    * proof of proposition  [ pr:16 ] . * here we prove ( [ eq : k3 ] ) claiming @xmath701 .",
    "the proof is a refined version of the previous proof .",
    "let @xmath18 be the three - partite complete hypergraph with parts @xmath702 , @xmath703 and @xmath704 where @xmath705 as before",
    ". split it into @xmath706 perfect matchings @xmath707 where the second coordinates are taken modulo @xmath32 .",
    "we also call these _",
    "parallel classes_.    choose independently each of the @xmath706 matchings with probability @xmath153 , @xmath153 will be defined as @xmath708 .",
    "call the obtained random hypergraph @xmath54 .",
    "count the expected number of the arising configurations @xmath709 , @xmath672 , @xmath673 , and @xmath677 , those we want to avoid .",
    "here we have to be more careful , because although each edge belongs to @xmath54 with probability @xmath153 ( so its expected size is @xmath710 ) the choices of edges are not independent .",
    "more precisely , the probability that a subhypergraph @xmath711 appears in @xmath54 is exactly @xmath712 , where @xmath713 is the number of different parallel classes in @xmath711 .",
    "intersecting triples always belong to different classes , so they are independent , so the expected number of @xmath57 s is @xmath714 and the expected number of @xmath672 s is @xmath715 .",
    "the expected number of grids in @xmath54 with independent hyperedges is @xmath716 and the expected number of @xmath673 s with independent edges is at most @xmath717 .",
    "a configuration @xmath673 might have only one pair of dependent triples , namely the disjoint pair @xmath718 , @xmath719 .",
    "the number of these configurations is at most @xmath720 ( first we chose the triple corresponding to @xmath718 in @xmath721 ways , then its parallel edge at most @xmath32 ways , and finally the 7th vertex at most @xmath722 ways ) .",
    "so the expected number of these is at most @xmath723 .",
    "consider , finally , the grids @xmath218 containing parallel triples . note that the parallel classes of @xmath711 and @xmath724 are distinct , because every @xmath47 meets every @xmath48 .",
    "the number of these configurations is @xmath725 ( like before , first we chose a triple in @xmath721 ways , then its parallel edge at most @xmath32 ways , and finally the three remaining vertices at most @xmath721 ways ) .",
    "so if the number of independent classes @xmath726 , then the expected number of these grids is bounded by @xmath717 .    if @xmath727 , then one of the three edges of the grid , say @xmath711 , consists of three parallel edges .",
    "the number of these configurations is at most @xmath728 , so we have an upper bound @xmath729 for the expected number of these whenever @xmath730 .    finally , if @xmath731 , then both @xmath711 and @xmath724 consists of parallel edges .",
    "the number of those systems is at most @xmath732 so we have an upper bound @xmath733 .    altogether the total expected number of configurations we want to avoid is bounded by a constant multiple of @xmath734 this is less than half of @xmath735 with our choice of @xmath153 .",
    "so we still have @xmath736 of the edges if we leave out an edge from each of the configurations we want to avoid , and thus we make the rest 3-union - free .",
    "moreover , conveniently , we can erase the unwanted edges together with all its parallels ( if @xmath711 is in @xmath18 then all of its shifted copy belongs to @xmath18 ) , so there is a random choice of @xmath18 where the remaining 3-union - free part is still large and union of matchings .",
    "dyachkov and rykov @xcite showed that there exists an optimal @xmath625-superimposed code ( i.e. , a regular graph ) with @xmath737 edges .",
    "it is easy to see , that there are @xmath240-regular @xmath32-vertex graphs for all @xmath738 ( for @xmath739 even ) . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath32 is even , and @xmath740 then , e.g. , by baranyai s theorem  @xcite the edge set of @xmath741 can be decomposed into @xmath742 perfect matchings .",
    "take @xmath240 of them . for odd @xmath32 ( and @xmath240 even ) @xmath741 can be decomposed into @xmath743 @xmath157-factors by a theorem of tutte .",
    "take @xmath744 of them .",
    "dyachkov and rykov  @xcite showed that there exist optimal 2-superimposed designs ( i.e. , a @xmath157-union - free , @xmath240-regular graphs ) for @xmath745 .",
    "this can be improved to @xmath746 indeed , such an optimal design is just a @xmath240-regular , triangle and @xmath747-free graph .",
    "such a graph can be constructed using  ( [ egyenes ] ) by taking a mod @xmath16 sidon set @xmath748 .",
    "the defined @xmath538 is the desired bipartite graph .",
    "we have an obvious upper bound @xmath749 .",
    "since @xmath750 by  @xcite we have an upper bound @xmath751 giving the right order of magnitude . to determine the coefficient of the @xmath752 seems to be a very difficult question .",
    "erds and simonovits  @xcite conjecture that @xmath753 they showed @xmath754 , i.e. , forbidding @xmath755 in magnitude is the same as forbidding all non - bipartite graphs .",
    "our main result is that the widely investigated transversal design @xmath538 ( see  ( [ egyenes ] ) ) with @xmath573 is @xmath49-free for @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath318 is @xmath1-sum - free then in addition @xmath538 has no triangles .",
