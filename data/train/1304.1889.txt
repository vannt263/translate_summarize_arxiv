    "generally galaxies host numerous x - ray sources .",
    "most off - nuclear , compact x - ray sources are believed to be x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) with a compact object  white dwarf , neutron star or a black hole .",
    "a few of the brightest x - ray sources at the high end of the point source luminosity function can exceed the eddington limit of even the most massive stellar mass black hole , sometimes by large factors .",
    "the nature of these sources , known as the ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , continues to remain an enigma since their dynamical mass measurements have not been possible .",
    "possible explanations for the high luminosities of ulxs include ( @xmath8 ) x - ray binaries with intermediate mass ( @xmath9 ) black holes ( imbh ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( @xmath10 ) x - ray binaries with anisotropic emission @xcite , ( @xmath11 ) beamed xrbs with relativistic jets directly pointing towards us i. e. , scaled down versions of blazars , and ( @xmath12 ) xrbs with super - eddington accretion rates @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of ulxs have shown a variety of spectral shapes e.g. , simple powerlaw similar to the low / hard state of bhbs @xcite and soft excess ( blackbody @xmath13 ) plus powerlaw component .",
    "the soft x - ray excess emission has been interpreted as optically thick emission from a thin accretion disk with temperatures in the range of @xmath14 , suggestive of an imbh accreting at sub - eddington ( @xmath15 ) rates @xcite .",
    "however , the cool disk plus powerlaw spectra of ulxs may not always correspond to the high / soft state of bhbs @xcite .",
    "high s / n _ xmm - newton _ observations of bright ulxs has revealed curvature or cut - offs in the spectra at high energies @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , it is not known if the x - ray spectrum actually has a cut - off or there is a deficit of emission near @xmath17 due to perhaps an absorption edge . observation of strong x - ray emission above @xmath18 will put strong constraints on the nature of ulxs .",
    "the presence of a strong hard x - ray powerlaw will establish ulxs to be either scaled - up bhbs or scaled - down versions of agns and the lack of emission near @xmath17 may then be explained as the blurred iron k - edge due to compton reflection arising from regions very close to a black hole . on the other hand , absence of such a strong hard x - ray component",
    "will make ulxs very different from bhbs or agns , probably accreting in a state that is not usually attained by them .",
    "_ suzaku _ observations have shown that the broadband spectrum of m82  x1 is slightly curved @xcite .",
    "however , m  82  x1 is in a crowded field and it is not clear if the contribution of nearby multiple unresolved sources both in the xis and pin fov can alter the broadband spectral shape .",
    "here we study the broadband spectral shape of two bright ulxs m81 x6 and holmberg ix x1 ( ho  ix  x1 ) located in the dwarf irregular galaxy holmberg ix , a companion of m81 .",

    "the ulx m81  x6 is @xmath25 away from the agn .",

    "this simple model resulted in a good fit , @xmath44 for @xmath45 degrees of freedom ( dof ) . to find any contribution from the nearby bright ulxs to the hxd / pin",
    ", we included an additional power - law component .",
    "we fixed the normalization of the second powerlaw component to zero for the xis and varied it for the pin data .",
    "this did not improve the fit and hence we calculated @xmath1 upper - limit on the @xmath2 flux by fixing the photon index @xmath46 at different values ranging from 1 to 2.5 .",
    "we find that the maximum possible contribution by the nearby ulxs is @xmath47 in the @xmath2 band .    to estimate the hard x - ray contribution from the ulxs , we fitted the xis spectra of ho  ix x1 and m81 x6 with absorbed power - law models and calculated the @xmath2 band fluxes by extrapolating the best - fit models .",
    "we found @xmath48(@xmath2)@xmath49 for ho  ix  x1 and @xmath50 for m81 x6 .",
    "thus , the estimated fluxes for the ulxs based on the extension of the simple power - law models are much higher than the @xmath1 upper - limit on the contribution by the nearby sources to the hxd / pin data .",
    "this implies that the ulxs lack significant hard x - ray emission and their spectra can not be described by a single power - law from soft - to - hard x - rays .",
    "this confirms the earlier results of a high energy cutoff in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of these ulxs @xcite .    to better constrain the broadband x - ray spectral shapes of the ulxs",
    ", we performed joint spectral analysis of the _ suzaku _ xis+pin spectra of the ulxs and the agn .",
    "for this purpose , we created isis fit functions which are a combination of models for the ulxs and the agn but a given model component is applied to a specific spectrum or a subset of spectra .",
    "first we fit the spectra obtained from the onaxis _ suzaku _ observation of the m81 agn .",
    "we used the combined xis fi spectra of the m81 ulx and the agn and the corresponding hxd / pin spectrum of the field .",
    "we did not use xis spectrum of ho ix x1 as it is not in the field of view .",
    "we also did not account for its contribution to the pn spectrum .",
    "this ulx is @xmath51 away from the agn in m81 .",
    "thus , given the triangular response of hxd / pin with an fwhm of @xmath52 , the ulx contributes @xmath53 of its actual flux to the pin data . as inferred above ,",
    "ho ix x1 generally lacks the hard x - ray emission and its contribution to the pin band is likely to be very small .",
    "we further deal with this issue below when we analyze the on - axis _ suzaku _ observation of ho  ix  x1 .    for the joint spectral analysis of the m81 ulx and the agn spectra , we used a joint model which is a combination of the model for the ulx ( wabs@xmath31(cutoffpl + gauss ) ) and the agn ( wabs@xmath31(powerlaw + gauss ) ) .",
    "we refer to this as model 1 .",
    "the ulx model only is applied to xis spectrum of m81 x6 and the agn model alone applied to the xis spectrum of the agn but both models are combined to fit to the pin data .",
    "as before , we excluded xis data below @xmath54 for the agn only and used a constant multiplicative factor of @xmath55 for the pin data .",
    "the model provided a statistically acceptable fit with @xmath56 and the best - fit parameters are listed in in table  [ tab1 ] while the unfolded spectral data and the best - fit model are shown in figure  [ jointfit ] .",
    "we also examined the continuation of the powerlaw in the hard band by fixing @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "the fit became worse with @xmath59 , ruling out the presence of such a powerlaw .",
    "further , we added an additional powerlaw component with @xmath60 to the best - fit ulx model 1 and estimated the @xmath1 upper - limit on the @xmath2 flux to be @xmath61 and the corresponding luminosity @xmath62 for an underlying power - law component .",
    "we also tested physical models that do not contribute significantly in the hard x - ray band .",
    "we replaced the cutoffpl in model 1 with the standard disk model diskbb which resulted in a good fit ( @xmath63 ) with @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "we also tested the p - free disk model diskpbb which allows the disk temperature to scale with radius as @xmath66 . for standard disk model , @xmath67 and lower values of @xmath68 may indicate a slim accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the p - free disk model resulted in a slightly better fit ( @xmath69 ) with @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the parameters of the agn model components remained similar for different ulx models cutoffpl , diskbb and the p - free disk .",
    "thus , we confirm that the m81 x6 spectrum cuts - off at high energies and does not contribute significantly to the hxd / pin band .",
    "moreover , any possible hard x - ray contribution by the ulx ho ix x1 ( which we show below is unlikely ) would further strengthen the result that m81 x6 is dim in hard x - rays .",
    "we next perform the joint spectral analysis of the onaxis _ suzaku _ observation of ho  ix  x1 .",
    "the ulx is well isolated spatially and its x - ray emission in the xis band is not contaminated by any other strong source ( see fig .  [ ulx_images ] ) .",
    "however , the pin data is obviously contaminated by the agn in m81 .",
    "we used a joint spectral model similar to the model 1 that combines the ulx model ( wabs@xmath31(bbody + cutoffpl + gauss ) and the agn model ( wabs@xmath31 ( powerlaw + gauss ) ) .",
    "we refer this as model 2 . as before we used a relative normalization of @xmath55 between the xis spectrum of ho  ix  x1 and its contribution to the pin spectrum .",
    "since there is no simultaneous xis spectrum of the agn , we used the agn xis spectrum from the onaxis observation of m81 .",
    "we used a variable relative normalization between the xis spectrum of the agn and its contribution to the pin band to allow for flux variability of the agn between the two _ suzaku _ observation .",
    "thus , the use of the xis agn spectrum in modeling the ulx spectrum is equivalent to assuming that the agn did not change its spectral shape .",
    "this is justified as the @xmath43 spectral shape of m81 agn is known to show very little variability if at all @xcite . as before we excluded the xis spectrum of agn below @xmath54 .",
    "the joint fit resulted in a statistically acceptable fit ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab1 ] while the unfolded spectrum and the best - fit models for the ulx and agn are shown in figure  [ jointfit ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the agn were similar to that obtained earlier ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "as expected from the earlier analysis , the spectrum of ho  ix  x1 cuts - off and makes very little contribution to the hxd / pin band .",
    "a weak iron line is detected for @xmath75 for two additional parameters i.e. , at a significance level of @xmath76 according to the f - test .",
    "the line width was not well constrained , therefore @xmath77 was fixed at its best - fit value .",
    "such a weak iron line was not detected in the long _ xmm - newton _",
    "observation @xcite and is most likely associated with the host galaxy .",
    "the relative normalization for the agn contribution to the pin data is @xmath78 .",
    "fixing the value to @xmath55 does not change the cutoff energy for the ulx and hence uncertainties in the agn flux does not effect the overall result .",
    "we further tested the reality of the spectral cut - off of ho  ix  x1 by fixing the cutoff energy at @xmath58 .",
    "this resulted in a poor fit ( @xmath79 for the loss of only one parameter ) .",
    "thus , the presence of spectral cut - off is highly significant .",
    "as before , we estimated @xmath1 upper limit on the @xmath2 flux of an underlying powerlaw component to be @xmath80 and the corresponding luminosity to be @xmath81 .",
    "we also tested the thermal comptonization model by replacing the cutoffpl in model 2 with the nthcomp and bbody with the diskbb component ( model 3 ) , the joint fit resulted in @xmath82 ) with @xmath83 . in this fit",
    ", we treated the diskbb component with @xmath84 to be the seed photon source for the comptonization .",
    "we calculated the flux of the diskbb and nthcomp components to be @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "using the broadband _ suzaku _ observations of the fields containing two bright ulxs , we measured x - ray luminosities of @xmath6 for m81 x6 and @xmath87 for ho  ix  x1 . with the joint spectral analysis of xis and pin spectra of the brightest sources in the field , we showed that the broadband spectra of m81  x6 and ho ix x1 cutoff at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "this conforms the high energy spectral curvature in these ulxs earlier found with the limited bandpass of _ xmm - newton _ @xcite . in addition , we do not find additional high energy spectral components similar to that observed from bhbs and agns .",
    "this demonstrates clearly that the two ulxs are in unusual spectral states that are distinctly different than that observed from bhbs and agns .",
    "the spectrum of m81  x6 is well described by the standard disk model with high temperature @xmath64 similar to that observed from bhbs but the inferred x - ray luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity of @xmath90 black hole .",
    "generally bhbs show standard disk spectra in their high / soft state with the relative accretion rate in the range of @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "thus , the observed x - ray luminosity of m81 x6 will correspond to @xmath92 .",
    "the temperature of the standard disk around such a large black hole is unlikely to exceed @xmath36 .",
    "thus , m81 x6 is not in the high / soft state generally observed in bhbs .",
    "the p - free disk fit showed that the temperature of disk ( @xmath93 ) at different radii is lower than that expected from a standard disk ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this suggests that the ulx m81 x6 likely hosts a slim accretion disk .",
    "we confirmed the soft excess from ho  ix  x1 and showed that the spectral downturn near @xmath89 earlier observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ continues in the hard x - ray band above @xmath18 .",
    "the soft excess and the spectral turnover is well described by a standard cool disk and cool comptonization as found earlier @xcite .",
    "based on the spectral analysis of high quality x - ray spectra of ulxs observed with _ xmm - newton _ , @xcite showed that most ulx spectra are best described by an outer cool disk and optically thick , cool comptonization .",
    "they termed such a spectral form as the ultraluminous state which is thought to represent spectral transition between eddington and super - eddington accretion flows .",
    "it is interesting to note that the luminosity of the soft excess component , described as diskbb , is @xmath95 corresponding to relative accretion of @xmath96 for a @xmath97 black hole .",
    "thus , if there is mild beaming of the comptonized component , a stellar mass black hole can explain the observed luminosity of ho  ix x1 .",
    "finally , we note that while many bhbs and agns show strong relativistically broadened iron line , we are yet to observe such lines from any ulx .",
    "@xcite explained the soft excess and drop near @xmath17 in the spectra of several ulx including m81 x6 and ho ix x1 in terms of relativistically blurred compton reflection from accretion disks .",
    "such a model requires strong continuum above @xmath98 .",
    "however , our finding of the spectral downturn and its continuation in the hard band above @xmath18 in ho x1 and m81 x6 imply the absence of a strong illuminating continuum .",
    "thus , our findings rule out the possibility of explaining the spectral downturn near @xmath17 as a blurred iron k - edge .",
    "the absence of a strong illuminating continuum is most likely the reason behind the non - detection of relativistically broadened iron lines from ulxs ."
