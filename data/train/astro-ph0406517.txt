    "dedicated searches for galaxies and clusters have been successful in recent years in narrowing the zoa , and obtaining redshifts , where possible , to map three dimensional large - scale structures at low galactic latitude ( see kraan - korteweg & lahav 2000 for an overview of the various multiwavelength campaigns in the zoa , and the many contributions in this volume . )",
    "results from the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) have produced an impressive narrowing of the zoa , particularly away from the galactic bulge region , and allowed appreciation of low - latitude large - scale structure traced by a homogeneous sample ( see contribution from huchra in this volume .",
    ") however , such methods fail in regions of heaviest obscuration , and highest foreground stellar surface density . fortunately",
    ", 21-cm searches for hi - bearing galaxies have been proven to succeed in obscured and confused areas ( eg .",

    "the multibeam receiver system on the parkes 64-m telescope , with its large footprint on the sky , allows a sensitive , wide area survey .",
    "the zoa accessible from parkes , covering @xmath1 , @xmath2  @xmath3  5@xmath4 , was observed to quite uniform sensitivity , due to the strategy of observing overlapping strips of constant galactic latitude ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1998 ; henning et al .",
    "2000 ; donley et al .",
    "the data were bandpass - corrected , doppler corrected , calibrated and gridded with resulting pixel and beam sizes of @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the observations were done over 27 fields of ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the effective integration time per beam was 2100 s [ compare with 450 s per beam integration time of the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; meyer et al .",
    "the correlator bandwidth of 64 mhz , set to cover the velocity range @xmath9 to 12700 km s@xmath0 , provides coverage in the third dimension , thus we speak of the _ datacubes _ , three - dimensional position - position - velocity representations of the survey data .",
    "because of the strong hi signal of the galaxy , which causes spectral ringing , the data were hanning smoothed , resulting in a velocity resolution of 27.0 km  s@xmath0 , a significant increase over the channel spacing of 13.2 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "strong continuum emission was subtracted , although some residual continuum baseline ripple remains where there was particularly strong continuum emission .      over most of the volume surveyed , away from small regions of strong continuum , the noise was about 6 mjy beam@xmath0 rms , which compares favorably to the hipass noise of 13 mjy beam@xmath0 .",
    "this noise of 6 mjy beam@xmath0 is equivalent to a 5@xmath10 hi mass detection limit of @xmath11 d@xmath12 m@xmath13 ( for a galaxy with a linewidth of 200 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "for instance , the survey was sensitive to galaxies with @xmath14 m@xmath13 at 60 mpc , and @xmath15 m@xmath13 at 100 mpc .",
    "thus , the survey was sensitive to normal spirals well beyond the great attractor region , and could detect some galaxies beyond 10,000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "it was also sensitive to very low mass local dwarfs , as well .",
    "the 27 datacubes were searched by members of the hi parkes zoa team .",
    "the cubes were searched by eye , because experimentation with automatic galaxy detection algorithms indicated that in the complicated region of the zoa , with regions of increased noise due to continuum sources and galactic hi , the human eye - brain system is enormously more effective at finding galaxies .",
    "each cube was searched by two , or sometimes three , independent searchers , using the visualization tool ` karma kview ` ( gooch 1995 ) , producing independent lists of galaxy candidates .",
    "figure 1 shows two slices through one of the datacubes , as a searcher would display and search the data .",
    "while the entire velocity range of the data was searched , confusion due to galactic hi generally prevented the recognition of galaxies within about @xmath16 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the higher noise at low latitudes near the galactic center creates a residual zoa , but even quite close to the galactic center direction we were able to detect galaxies ( fig .",
    "the datacubes have all been searched , and a list of over 1000 galaxy candidates has been produced . to generate a uniformly - selected catalog ,",
    "all galaxy candidates will be inspected by one person ( pah ) , who decides if a candidate is to be included in the final catalog . as of writing ( june 2004 ) , 16 of the 27 cubes have been inspected by the adjudicator , with 469 candidates accepted .",
    "the adjudication is complete over the longitude ranges of @xmath17 to @xmath18 , @xmath19 to @xmath20 , and other isolated longitudes . in the regions @xmath21 to @xmath18 and @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( the `` northern extension '' ) , the data are presented by donley et al .",
    "in figure 3 , the upper panel shows the distribution of galaxies in the literature ( selected from the leda database ) , and the outline of our survey region in the zoa .",
    "the traditional zoa is clearly visible as a paucity of galaxies at low galactic latitude . in the lower panel , with",
    "our confirmed galaxies and candidates added in , the zoa fills in remarkably well , and several large - scale structures are seen to cross the galactic plane . the great attractor region is seen as an overdensity at @xmath24 , the hydra - antlia filament at @xmath25 and the puppis filament crosses at @xmath26 .",
    "the local and sagittarius voids are visible as an underdensity of galaxies at @xmath27 .    in velocity space ,",
    "as shown in figure 4 , quite a number of structures become apparent .",
    "the broad overdensity of the great attractor is evident at velocity @xmath28 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "only a portion of this feature was known from higher - latitude catalogs , and is labelled as part of the norma supercluster in figure 5 .",
    "galaxies associated with the pks 1343 - 601 cluster are also labelled in figure 5 , as is the puppis cluster , and background void .",
    "the filament hinted at , at @xmath29 in figure 3 becomes clear in the wedge diagram , which we label `` hydra wall and monoceros extension '' in figure 5 .",
    "of the 469 confirmed hi galaxies ( most others will certainly be real , but the adjudication is not yet complete ) , there are 191 for which there is a nir source listed within 6 in the 2mass extended source catalog .",
    "we have not yet examined these nir sources to check if they are all galaxian , or if some are confused galactic objects , quite possible at low latitudes . in the longitude range @xmath19 to @xmath20",
    ", there are 186 hi detections , 131 of which have an extended 2mass counterpart ( 70% ) . as we continue to study the hi - selected galaxies",
    ", we can investigate the populations of zoa galaxies uncovered at 21 cm _ vs.  _ at nir wavelengths .",
    "one would expect the hi galaxies to be generally of later type , but this will be quantified better in the future .",
    "in contrast , in the galactic bulge region , @xmath30 to @xmath31 , only 6 of the 155 hi detections have a 2mass extended source within 6of the hi ( 4% ) .",
    "the poor performance of the nir survey in recovering the hi - selected galaxies is due to the extreme stellar confusion in the galactic bulge .",
    "the completeness of the 2mass survey is a function of stellar survey density , and drops even as far as @xmath32 from the galactic center near the galactic plane .",
    "to produce the final catalog of the hi parkes deep zoa survey , we are working to finish the adjudication of candidates .",
    "we then will measure hi parameters , and quantify the selection function _ a posteriori _",
    ", since this sample has been selected by human eyes . when the full sample is constructed , its hi properties , large - scale structures traced , and nir counterparts will be investigated . we are also extending the search region with new observations to higher latitudes in the galactic bulge area , since there the zoa extends further than @xmath33 from the plane ( see fig .  3 .",
    ") finally , we are exploring the possibility of using the new 21-cm multibeam receiver at the arecibo observatory to extend our map of hidden hi galaxies and large - scale structures further to the north .",
