    "m82 is the prototypical starburst galaxy , and at x - ray energies is a very complex source , with a superwind extending out of the plane of the galaxy for several kpc , and a luminous , point - like central x - ray source ( _ c.f._watson , stanger & griffiths 1984 ; moran & lehnert 1997 ) .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on point source emission from the central regions of m82 , rather than the diffuse superwind emission , which has been discussed elsewhere ( _ i.e._fabbiano 1988 ; strickland , ponman & stevens 1997 ) .",
    "there has been much speculation as to the nature of the central x - ray source in m82 , which is also variable ( collura _ et al._1994 ) .",
    "suggestions have included a low - luminosity agn ( tsuru _ et al._1997 ) , inverse compton emission ( moran & lehnert 1997 ) , an x - ray luminous supernova remnant ( terlevich 1994 ) , a collection of x - ray binaries ( ptak _ et al._1997 ) , a single luminous massive x - ray binary ( bregman , schulman & tomisaka 1995 ) , or emission analogous to the galactic ridge emission ( cappi _ et al._1999 ) .",
    "we note that hard x - ray point sources with comparable luminosities have been seen in other starburst galaxies , so that understanding the source in m82 may have more general applicability .",
    "our goal is to understand the x - ray emission by identifying probable radio counterparts to x - ray sources in the central regions .",
    "because the x - ray emission is complex , with diffuse and point - like emission , this requires careful analysis .",
    "we only analyse data from the  hri instrument , which has the best current spatial resolution ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we assume a distance to m82 of 3.63mpc ( freedman _ et al._1994 ) .",
    "m82 has been observed by the  hri on three occasions , for 53.1ksec , 24.6ksec and 9.5ksec ( see table [ tab : x1 ] ) .",
    "details of  and the hri instrument can be found in briel _",
    "et al._(1995 ) . to minimise the detector background",
    "we extract images from each hri observation selecting only channels 38 . for all datasets we extracted an image of the entire field , and used the _ asterix _",
    "point source searching ( _ pss _ ) package to detect sources away from the bright central regions .",
    "we cross - correlated the detected x - ray sources with the hst guide star catalogue and the digitized sky survey .",
    "the results were inconclusive , but did not suggest major pointing errors .",
    "the  @xmath1 pointing uncertainty is @xmath2 ( briel _ et al._1995 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] ) . the pointing errors associated with the centroid fitting with the _ pss _ package are typically smaller ( table  [ tab : x2 ] ) , and we adopt a @xmath2 error circle for the positions of the x - ray point - sources .",
    "the impact of the pointing uncertainty is discussed in section  3 .",
    "we also cross - correlated the point sources for the three x - ray observations , to align the x - ray images .",
    "next , we extracted high resolution x - ray images of the central kpc of m82 , with @xmath3 pixels , for detailed source searching in the central regions .",
    "it is vital to accurately account for the extended superwind emission in m82 in order to reliably identify point sources .",
    "to do so we adopted the following iterative procedure . for our initial background model we used the",
    "non - background subtracted image for each observation , smoothed with a gaussian ( @xmath4 fwhm ) .",
    "we source searched this image to identify the first set of point sources ( with a _",
    "@xmath5 ) . for the second iteration we improved the background model by removing any sources detected in the first iteration ( out to a radius of @xmath6 ) ,",
    "interpolated over the removed source regions and smoothed again .",
    "we then source searched again with this improved background model .",
    "we repeated this process until we had a stable number of sources .",
    "the point sources detected by this procedure are discussed below .    .",
    "hri observations of m82 used in this paper , listed in descending order of exposure time [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : x2 ]      41.95 + 57.5 is the brightest radio point source in m82 , and is believed to be a young snr .",
    "it is sufficiently radio luminous to qualify as a radio supernova  ( rsn , a type ii supernova exploding in a dense environment - van dyk _ et al._1993 ) .",
    "41.95 + 57.5 is a young shell - type sn , with a diameter of @xmath7 ( 0.4pc ; muxlow _ et al._1994 ) , corresponding to a characteristic age of only 70 years ( assuming a constant expansion velocity of @xmath8 ) .",
    "we note that this age will be in error if we are dealing with a strongly decelerating blast - wave in a dense medium .",
    "44.01 + 59.6 was considered a possible agn candidate on account of its peculiar radio spectra ( wills _ et al._1997 ) , which makes its detection as an x - ray source of particular note .",
    "44.01 + 59.6 was thought to have a positive radio spectral index , as inferred for advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) onto massive black - holes ( yi & boughn 1998 ) .",
    "recent evidence suggests that 44.01 + 59.6 is a young rsn , being radio luminous but showing a pronounced low frequency cut - off ( allen & kronberg 1998 ) .",
    "however , wills _",
    "et al._(1999a ) suggest that 44.01 + 59.6 may still contain an agn .",
    "the radio diameter is @xmath9 ( 0.9pc ; muxlow _ et al._1994 ) , corresponding to a characteristic age of 170 years ( assuming an expansion velocity of @xmath8 ) .",
    "both x - ray sources are associated with super star - clusters ( oconnell _ et al._1995 ) , to be expected as the progenitors were most likely massive stars .",
    "the hri instrument does not have any significant spectral capabilities , so to convert count - rates to fluxes we have to assume a spectral model .",
    "based on  results for the central x - ray source we assume a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( ptak _ et al._1997 ) .",
    "the broadband ( @xmath12 ) x - ray luminosities can be estimated using the source count - rates in the soft ( @xmath13 ) hri waveband , along with this spectral model .",
    "there are problems with determining the luminosity from the 53.1ksec observation , as the attitude solution seems to be in error , resulting in a blurring of the image . consequently , luminosity estimates assuming a point source and the hri psf results in an underestimate .",
    "using a larger gaussian psf ( @xmath14 fwhm ) results in a substantially higher luminosity - in line with that for the two other observations .",
    "following the same procedure for the other observations results in a slightly higher luminosity ( as might be expected ) , but the increase in luminosity with increasing gaussian size is much steeper for the 53.1ksec observation . while some variability is clearly seen from source x-2 ( ptak _ et al._1997 ) the satellite aspect error may result in an overestimate of the level of variability .",
    "for the two x - ray point sources with radio counterparts we derive x - ray luminosities ( @xmath12 , corrected for absorption ) of @xmath15 for source x-2 ( associated with 41.95 + 57.5 ) and @xmath16 for source x-3 ( associated with 44.01 + 59.6 ) .",
    "we shall discuss these luminosities in the context of x - ray luminous rsn later .",
    "for the other two x - ray point sources we find @xmath17 , levels attainable by normal massive x - ray binaries ( mxrbs ) , such as smcx-1 . in the absence of any discernible radio counterparts",
    "we conclude that these sources are likely to be mxrbs .",
    "we have identified 4 x - ray point sources in the central regions of m82 and the probable association between two x - ray sources and luminous rsn in m82 .",
    "these two rsn are amongst the youngest and luminous sn in m82 , and their association with the brightest x - ray sources is unlikely to be a coincidence .",
    "importantly , we can conclude that the bright central x - ray source in m82 is coincident with a bright rsn .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of sources x-2 and x-3 are consistent with this model ( see below ) .",
    "the recent discovery of several x - ray luminous rsn has fueled interest in their evolution .",
    "there exist x - ray observations of young rsn ( with ages @xmath18 years ; for example sn1978k , sn1979c , sn1980k , sn1986j , sn1993j , sn1988z - see schlegel 1995 , fabian & terlevich 1996 , immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ) , and older sn remnants ( ages @xmath19 years ) , but the intervening range , in which the two candidates in m82 probably fall , is poorly sampled . in fig .",
    "[ fig : x2 ] we plot @xmath20 versus age for the two m82 rsn as well as several other young rsn ( schlegel 1995 ) .",
    "we also include another example of an older x - ray luminous rsn , the x - ray source x-4 in ngc4449 , with @xmath21 , and a dynamical age of @xmath22years ( vogler & pietsch 1997 ) .    in most models of young sn the reverse shock dominates the x - ray emission ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "however , terlevich _ et al._(1992 ) suggested that the forward shock would dominate for a sn explosion in a dense environment .",
    "these objects have been termed compact snr ( csnr - terlevich 1994 ) .",
    "fabian & terlevich ( 1996 ) applied this model to investigate sn1988z , and we adopt this model here .",
    "we note that wills _",
    "et al._(1999b ) suggest that 41.95 + 57.5 is in a very unusual environment , with chimney  like features . assuming a @xmath23  ergs sn explosion in a constant density medium the broadband x - ray luminosity during the radiative phase will be ( fabian & terlevich 1996 )      with @xmath25 the time in units of 100 years , and @xmath26 the ambient density in units of @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : x2 ] we illustrate the evolution of such an sn , and see that the luminosities for the m82 sources are broadly consistent with the future evolution of an sn1988z like object . for sn1988z fabian & terlevich ( 1996 )",
    "estimated an @xmath28 assuming no local absorption .",
    "sn1986j , another x - ray luminous rsn , has a fitted column of @xmath29 ( houck _ et al._1998 ) , with the absorption mostly coming from dense shells of material associated with the sn .",
    "if such a column were applied to sn1988z this would imply a higher luminosity , with @xmath30 .",
    "a comment should be made about the radio properties of sn1988z as compared to the objects in m82 . according to van dyk _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) , at a time @xmath31 years after the sn explosion , the 6 cm flux from sn1988z was 1.7mjy and evolving as @xmath32 with @xmath33 . if sn1988z were at the distance of m82 , the flux at the same epoch would be 1.35jy , and and at an epoch @xmath34 years after the sn explosion the flux would be 30mjy , sufficiently close to the current observed value for 41.95 + 57.5 to add weight to the view that the x - ray sources in m82 are similar in nature to sn1988z , but somewhat older .",
    "the radio spectral indices of sn1988z and sn1986j are similar to that for 41.95 + 57.5 and 44.01 + 59.6 ( van dyk _",
    "et al._1993 ; allen & kronberg 1999 ) .",
    "et al._(1997 ) originally suggested 44.01 + 59.6 may be an agn on account of its radio spectrum . using the results of yi & boughn ( 1998 ) , the 2 cm radio and x - ray fluxes",
    "imply that if the source x-3 is an adaf then the accreting black - hole has a mass of @xmath35 . here",
    "we have assumed 44.01 + 59.6 is a rsn ( allen & kronberg 1998 , though see wills _",
    "et al._1999a ) .",
    "interestingly , the hardness of the spectrum of source x-2 is similar to that expected from an adaf , and this could pose a problem for the rsn model . the source spectra can be fitted with @xmath36(for a thermal model ) or alternatively a power - law with index @xmath37 ( moran & lehnert 1997 ) .",
    "terlevich _ et al._(1992 ) predicted that the evolution of shock temperature for a csnr will be @xmath38 .",
    "some rsn , younger than the sources in m82 , have measured x - ray temperatures already lower than that for source x-2 ( _ i.e._sn1978k - ryder _ et al._1993 ; sn1986j - bregman & pildis 1992 , though  observations of sn1986j find @xmath39 - houck _ et al._1998 ) .",
    "however , terlevich _ et al._(1992 ) and plewa ( 1995 ) suggest that the spectrum of a single csnr will be a power - law , with a slope similar to that observed for source x-2 .",
    "consequently , it is not clear whether the observed spectra of x-2 is at odds with that expected .",
    "however , we do mention the following possibility ; for older sn remnants the x - ray emission can be dominated by non - thermal emission ( _ i.e._sn1006 , koyama _ et al._1995 ) .",
    "et al._(1997 ) report on two hard x - ray emitting regions in the sn remnant ic443 , which they interpret as being due to non - thermal emission ( with power - law spectra with @xmath40 ) .",
    "they find that the non - thermal regions , which dominate the hard x - ray emission from the remnant , are located on the edges of the remnant , where the shock - wave is interacting with dense molecular gas .",
    "et al._(1997 ) discuss their results in terms of the sn shock / dense cloud interaction model of jones & kang ( 1993 ) , which predicts strong particle acceleration and non - thermal x - ray emission from such a situation .",
    "the scenario of a strong sn shock encountering dense gas ( either a molecular cloud or wind material from an earlier evolutionary phase ) is exactly what would be expected in the central regions of m82 .",
    "thus a strong sn shock / dense gas interaction will result in strong non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "in this situation we might also expect there to be significant variability , in line with what is seen for source x-2 .",
    "observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ will constrain whether the x - ray spectrum of 41.95 + 57.5 is thermal or non - thermal in nature .",
    "hard ( and variable ) point - like sources have been seen in the centres of other starbursts ( _ c.f._ptak _ et al._1997 ; dahlem , heckman & fabbiano 1995 ) .",
    "we speculate that x - ray luminous rsn could account for these sources , without resorting to a low - luminosity agn or mxrbs with extremely massive ( @xmath41 ) black - holes .",
    "ultimately it may prove to be difficult to determine whether the x - ray emission from the sources is due to an agn or a rsn on x - ray grounds .",
    "long - term variability will be important , with a long - term decline indicative of an rsn , while stochastic variability may favour an agn ( although short - timescale variability is also predicted in the csnr model , tenorio - tagle 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , from collura _",
    "et al._(1994 ) , source x-2 was about 50% fainter in  observations made in 1979 , as compared to  observations made in 1991 .",
    "source x-3 was also detected by the  hri ( watson _ et al._1984 ) .",
    "assuming the spectral model and distance to m82 adopted here we infer @xmath42 , somewhat above that measured by .",
    "the x - ray lightcurves shown in collura _",
    "et al._(1994 ) and ptak & griffiths ( 1999 ) appear stochastic on timescales of days and months and would seem to favour the agn model , although it must be stressed that there are no sufficiently detailed observations of the x - ray variability of rsn .",
    "if indeed the sn explodes in a clumpy environment such stochastic variability would be expected .    in summary , we find that the two brightest x - ray point sources in the central regions of m82 are likely associated with two bright radio objects ( 41.95 + 57.5 and 44.01 + 59.6 ) .",
    "while there is some pointing uncertainty in the  observations , the alignment between the brightest x - ray point sources and the most luminous rsn in m82 is unlikely to be a coincidence .",
    "both radio counterparts are believed to be young rsn with ages @xmath22 years .",
    "the x - ray emission could be dominated by non - thermal emission associated with a shock / cloud interaction , though verification of this will require more observations .",
    "these objects begin to fill an important gap in our understanding of sn evolution .",
    "_ chandra _ observations will be key in confirming their nature and monitoring their x - ray evolution ."
