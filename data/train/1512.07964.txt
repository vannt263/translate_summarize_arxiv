    "the low coordinated surface atoms of transition metal nano - clusters play a significant role in deciding their magnetic properties .",
    "surface adsorption of gaseous molecules directly affects the electronic properties of the surface atoms in clusters and influences their overall magnetic properties .",
    "chemisorption of gaseous molecules on the surface of transition metal nano - clusters and its effects , particularly on magnetic properties , has attracted attention in recent experimental as well as theoretical works .",
    "several studies have revealed spectacular variations of cluster magnetism depending on the types of chemical species and the nature of interactions between the surface atoms and the adsorbed species .",
    "for example , the molecular beam deflection experiment by knickelbein s group revealed enhanced magnetic moment for hydrogenated fe@xmath4 clusters as compared to pristine ones , for sizes ranging @xmath5 = 10 @xmath6 25.@xcite interestingly , this result is in contrast to those for larger iron nano - particles , as well as for thin films , in which quenching of magnetic moment has been found upon hydrogen absorption .",
    "similar trend of quenched magnetic moments upon chemisorption has also been found in the case of benzene - capped and co molecule coated co clusters,@xcite whereas mere chemisorption of oxygen does not affect the magnetization of co clusters at all.@xcite the adsorption induced magnetism for ni - clusters exhibits rather interesting variations . as for example , the full coverage of ni@xmath4 clusters by n@xmath7 molecules leads to the quenching of magnetic moment , but it survives at partial coverage.@xcite similarly , the quenching of magnetic moment results with a partial adsorption of nh@xmath8 molecules and a complete quenching occurs when the number of nh@xmath8 molecules adsorbed equals to the number of surface ni atoms .",
    "surprisingly , further adsorption leads to reappearance of magnetic moment as a consequence of the variation of ni - n distance with coverage of the absorbent.@xcite again , while the adsorptions of co and h@xmath7 on ni clusters decrease their magnetic moments,@xcite the adsorption of atomic o on the small ni@xmath4 clusters induces either enhanced or reduced magnetic moments depending on cluster size , an effect attributed to adsorption induced reconstruction of cluster structures.@xcite besides the 3@xmath9 late transition metal clusters , some limited studies of chemisorption on the clusters of 3@xmath9 early transition metal elements , have also been reported .",
    "like , adsorption of a single co molecule on sc@xmath4 clusters results quenching in magnetic moment depending on the size of clusters.@xcite in the case of v@xmath4 clusters , adsorption of n@xmath7 and no , o@xmath7 , c@xmath7h@xmath10 leads to oscillation or quenching / enhancement in magnetic moments.@xcite    cu atom has an electronic configuration of 3@xmath114@xmath12 among the 3@xmath9 transition metal series .",
    "it is therefore , characterized by a closed shell of @xmath9 electrons and one @xmath13 electron in the outermost atomic shell , similar to simple alkali metal atoms .",
    "cu clusters are , therefore , expected to share similar properties with alkali metal clusters and these properties are likely to be described by the shell model@xcite in a first attempt . on the other hand , the energy level separation between the valence @xmath13 and @xmath9 levels in a copper atom is small , giving rise to significant @xmath13-@xmath9 hybridization .",
    "in contrast to alkali metal clusters , this @xmath13-@xmath9 hybridization also plays important role for deciding many properties of cu .",
    "moreover , its role as a magnetic impurity in a semiconductor host , has attracted special attention for designing diluted magnetic semiconductors and spintronic systems because of its filled 3@xmath9 shell and therefore of intrinsic nonmagnetic character.@xcite recently , the possibility of ferromagnetism of cu - doped gan with a curie temperature above the room temperature , has been reported.@xcite however , the origin of this ferromagnetism is still being debated .    in this work ,",
    "we have studied the effect of n - capping as well as n mono - doping on the structural and magnetic properties of small cu@xmath4 clusters using first principles density functional theory ( dft ) based electronic structure calculations .",
    "we find that the effects of n - capping are remarkable with respect to magnetic applications of the capped systems as the n - capping induces giant magnetic moments to the capped cu@xmath4 clusters .",
    "our study reveals that this enhanced magnetic moment results from the fact that the n - capping first induces spin polarization to the cu - atoms through hybridization of the @xmath13-@xmath9 hybridized orbitals of cu atoms with the @xmath14 orbitals of the capping n atoms and couples all the atom - centered magnetic moments ferromagnetically .",
    "we also note that such mechanism of induced ferromagnetism of the capped cu clusters plays a major role in the observed ferromagnetism of the cu - doped gan semiconductors .",
    "in addition , we propose an endohedral doping mechanism to enhance the ferromagnetism of the n - capped systems and thereby using them as building blocks for constructing highly magnetic materials .",
    "a study of the effect of capping on the structural rearrangement of the parent cluster would be an important issue if we wish to examine the origin of the modified properties of the capped system with respect to its parent cluster.@xcite surprisingly , it may sometimes lead to the formation of cage - like hollow structures.@xcite with respect to such cage structures , an endohedral doping process _",
    "i.e. _ introducing dopants _ within _ the hollow cage , is considered to be another promising means of tailoring its intrinsic magnetic character .",
    "this can be seen in various cluster - fullerene systems , as well as for doped icosahedral - like structures of many metal clusters.@xcite it actually performs a synergistic role in most cases , where it helps to further stabilize the cage - like structure along with engineering its magnetic properties .",
    "for example , while there is no appreciable spin density on an empty cage of c@xmath15 fullerene , the cluster - fullerene gd@xmath8n@c@xmath15 forms a stable magnetic unit with high magnetic moment which is largely contributed by the localized @xmath16 electrons of the gd atoms.@xcite enhanced magnetic moments of a cage - like icosahedral m@xmath2 clusters ( m = metal atom ) upon appropriate substitution at the central site , has been examined extensively.@xcite since the n capped cu@xmath4 clusters are interesting for magnetic applications , it is essential to explore the possibilities of engineering its magnetic properties further .",
    "we have considered a case of cage - like icosahedral nitrogenated cu@xmath2 cluster and scrutinized the possibility of using endohedral doping by a cr atom for constructing materials with even higher magnetic moments .",
    "the interesting point of this study is that while the bare cu@xmath3cr cluster maintains an icosahedral structure and has overall zero net magnetic moment , both the capped systems - cu@xmath2n@xmath3 and cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 possess giant magnetic moments .",
    "the maximum value is obtained in case of the cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 cluster . in the following ,",
    "we have first given a brief outline of the background of applied methodology in the section [ methodology ] , then a detailed analysis of the results on stability and magnetism in terms of bonding characteristics and electronic properties in the section [ results ] .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion in the section [ conclu ] .",
    "the calculations reported in this study , were based on dft _ within _ the framework of pseudo - potential plane wave method , as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp).@xcite we used the projected augmented wave ( paw ) pseudo - potential @xcite coupled with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange correlation energy functional as formulated by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite the 3@xmath9 as well as 4@xmath13 electrons for cu / cr atoms and 2@xmath14 as well as 2@xmath13 electrons for n atoms were treated as valence electrons and the wave functions were expanded in the plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cut - off of 280 ev . the convergence of the energies with respect to the cut - off value were checked .",
    "reciprocal space integrations were carried out at the @xmath17 point .",
    "for the cluster calculations , a simple cubic super - cell was used with periodic boundary conditions , where two neighboring clusters were kept separated by around 12  vacuum space , which essentially makes the interaction between cluster images negligible .",
    "symmetry unrestricted geometry optimizations were performed using the conjugate gradient and the quasi - newtonian methods until all the force components were less than a threshold value of 0.001 ev /  . to determine the magnetic moment of the minimum - energy structure in spin polarized scalar relativistic calculations ,",
    "the geometry optimization was performed for all the possible spin multiplicities for each structure under the approximation of collinear atomic spin arrangements , as followed in our recent works.@xcite we also considered different spin arrangements among the atoms for a particular spin multiplicity .",
    "after all , special care has been taken to suppress the n - n interactions among the capping n atoms , in a similar manner of obtaining steric conformations for surface ligands in case of passivated quantum dots.@xcite",
    "we have first analyzed the optimized structures , stability and magnetic properties for the n - capped as well as n - monodoped cu@xmath4 clusters in the size range @xmath5 = 2@xmath66 in section [ capped ] .",
    "we have then considered a particular case of a cu@xmath2 cluster and examined both the effects of n - capping as well as endohedral cr - doping for further tuning the magnetic properties of the cu@xmath2 cluster .",
    "the results related to cu@xmath2 clusters have been discussed in the section [ endo ] .",
    "any theoretical study on the precise determination of the properties of an atomic cluster , first demands the determination of its minimum energy structure ( mes ) in complex potential energy surface .",
    "we have , therefore , first determined the mes for the pure cu@xmath4 clusters with @xmath18 2@xmath66 by relaxing the atomic positions and by minimizing both the total energy and spin .",
    "several most probable initial configurations were tried to ensure that the optimized structure does not correspond to a local minimum .",
    "our results indicate planar structures for each of the pure clusters in accordance with the previous reports.@xcite for example , the calculated mes of the cu@xmath8 cluster , has a triangular shape and this triangular unit constitutes the building block for the mes of the subsequent higher sized clusters .",
    "likewise , the cu@xmath10 cluster adopts a rectangular shape , consisting of two triangles , the cu@xmath19 cluster adopts a trapezoidal shape consisting of three triangles .",
    "finally , the pure cu@xmath1 cluster has an overall triangular shape , where two interpenetrating triangular cu@xmath8 clusters are clubbed together and therefore , the composite has four triangular building blocks . though bulk copper is nonmagnetic , small copper clusters are spin polarized and possess some week magnetic moments due to the presence of the low - coordinated surface atoms .",
    "we found that each of the even - numbered pure cu@xmath4 clusters has zero magnetic moment as all electrons are paired . on the other hand ,",
    "the odd - numbered pure cu@xmath4 clusters possess a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 each due to presence of a single unpaired electron .",
    "note that such odd - even alterations in the magnetic moments has also been reported previously for the small pure au@xmath4 and cu@xmath4 clusters.@xcite    unlike the pure clusters , the capped as well as mono - doped clusters show a structural transition from a 2d planar to 3d geometries with increasing size for the optimized systems .",
    "fig.[mes ] shows the mess for the n - caped as well as n - mono doped cu@xmath4 clusters for @xmath18 2@xmath66 . for the capped systems , the cu@xmath4 core adopts a planar geometry for @xmath182@xmath63 and it is of 3d geometry for @xmath204@xmath66 . as seen from the fig.[mes ] that the ground state structures for each of the cu@xmath10n@xmath10 , cu@xmath19n@xmath19 and cu@xmath1n@xmath1 clusters , contain a tetrahedral cu@xmath10 , triangular bi- pyramidal cu@xmath19 and tetragonal bi - pyramidal cu@xmath1 cores respectively .",
    "the first isomer of the cu@xmath10n@xmath10 cluster contains a rectangular cu@xmath10 core which lies 0.2 ev higher in energy from the ground state structure .",
    "likewise , the first isomers of the cu@xmath19n@xmath19 and cu@xmath1n@xmath1 clusters contain a square pyramidal cu@xmath19 core and a capped triangular bi - pyramidal cu@xmath1 core respectively .",
    "our calculated energy differences between the ground state and the first isomer of the cu@xmath19n@xmath19 and cu@xmath1n@xmath1 clusters , are 0.25 ev and 0.15 ev respectively .",
    "interestingly , the isomers having a planar cu@xmath4 core , are 0.8 ev and 1.02 ev above the corresponding ground states for the cu@xmath19n@xmath19 and cu@xmath1n@xmath1 clusters , respectively .",
    "table i provides more information about the structural parameters of the ground state and first isomer of the capped clusters .",
    "note that the preferred spin multiplicities of the first isomers are the same as that of the ground state structure in case of the cu@xmath10n@xmath10 , cu@xmath19n@xmath19 and cu@xmath1n@xmath1 clusters .",
    "for the case of n - mono - doped systems _",
    "i.e _ the cu@xmath4n clusters , the cu@xmath4 core adopts planar shape up to @xmath20 4 and it is of 3d square pyramidal and tetragonal bi - pyramidal shapes for the cu@xmath19n and cu@xmath1n clusters , respectively . for the later two mono - doped systems , the isomers having a planar cu@xmath4 core , are 0.4 ev and 0.89 ev higher in energy from the respective ground states .",
    "a detailed analysis of the ground state structures of the cu@xmath4n@xmath4 clusters , reveals that the average number of nearest neighbor cu atoms for a given cu atom , is varying as 1 , 2 , 3 , 3.6 and 4 for @xmath18 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "the average value of cu - cu - n angles also show interesting variations along the increasing size of the capped systems , such as @xmath21 = 150@xmath22 , 145@xmath22 , 140@xmath22 and 135@xmath22 for the optimal cu@xmath8n@xmath8 , cu@xmath10n@xmath10 , cu@xmath19n@xmath19 and cu@xmath1n@xmath1 clusters respectively .",
    "this uniform variation of @xmath21 angle establishes it as a guiding rule for the ground state geometries . on the other hand for the optimized structure of the n - monodoped clusters ,",
    "the average value of cu - n - cu angles varies around 90@xmath22 , such as @xmath23 = 91.5@xmath22 , 89.2@xmath22 , 81.7@xmath22 , 92.1@xmath22 and 84.9@xmath22 for the optimized cu@xmath7n , cu@xmath8n , cu@xmath10n , cu@xmath19n and cu@xmath1n clusters , respectively .",
    "we analyzed the energetics of the cu@xmath4n and cu@xmath4n@xmath4 clusters in terms of the total energies of the pure cu@xmath4 and capped / doped systems corresponding to their ground state structures .",
    "for the capped systems _",
    "i.e _ cu@xmath4n@xmath4 clusters , we have calculated the energy gain , @xmath24 in adding @xmath5 number of n - atoms to an existing cu@xmath4 cluster , as @xmath25 = -[e(cu@xmath4n@xmath4)-e(cu@xmath4)-@xmath5e(n ) ]",
    ". similarly , the energy gain @xmath26 for the mono doped systems corresponds to the energy gain for a single n atom doping .",
    "first , the energetics of the pure cu@xmath4 clusters have been revised by analyzing their binding energies which are calculated as @xmath27 = -[e(cu@xmath4)-@xmath5e(cu ) ] .",
    "our calculated binding energies for the optimized pure cu@xmath4 clusters are @xmath27 = 2.24 ev , 3.66 ev , 6.33 ev , 8.57 ev and 11.44 ev for @xmath18 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath24 and @xmath26 for the optimal structure of the respective capped and doped systems are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that @xmath24 values increase monotonically with increasing cluster size , which demonstrates increasing stability of the capped systems . on the other hand , the @xmath26 values for the n - mono doped systems ,",
    "show an overall decreasing trend with increasing cluster size .",
    "however , these values of @xmath26 are always @xmath28ve for all the mono doped systems , indicating mono dopings are also energetically favorable . in order to understand the enhancement in stability ,",
    "specially of the capped systems , we have analyzed the nature of the cu@xmath7 and cun dimers bonding as well as the overall variation in the average cu - cu and cu - n bond lengths in the optimized structures of the pure , mono - doped and capped systems as shown in fig .",
    "[ bl ] . in the atomic structure of a copper atom , the valence 3@xmath9 shell",
    "is completely filled with a single 4@xmath13 electron outside it .",
    "therefore , two cu atoms in a cu@xmath7 dimer , are coupled by week @xmath29 bond resulting in a larger bond length of 2.22 .",
    "note that the estimated bond length of the cu@xmath7 dimer is in excellent agreement with its experimental value.@xcite when a nitrogen atom is attached to form a cun dimer , the @xmath13-@xmath9 hybridized electrons of the copper atom interacts with the 2@xmath30 electrons of nitrogen atom resulting in a stronger bond and thereby a shorter bond length of 1.75 for a cun dimer .",
    "the charge density contour plot of the cu@xmath7 and cun dimers as shown in the fig .",
    "[ bl ] demonstrates this type of bonding .",
    "[ bl ] also shows that the average cu - cu bond lengths is larger in the mono - doped as well as capped systems compared to that in the pure cu@xmath4 clusters .",
    "it indicates that the cu - cu bond strength decreases upon the capping / doping .",
    "the enhanced stability of the capped systems , is therefore mainly caused by the enhanced stability of the cu - n bonds , as the number of cu - n bonds in the ground state structures of the capped systems , increases with increasing cluster size .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we address the the main issue of the magnetic behavior for the three different classes of systems . first , for the pure clusters , the magnetic moments show an even - odd alternation in accordance with the previous reports.@xcite for each of the even numbered cu@xmath4 clusters , all valence electrons are paired , giving a closed shell electronic structure which results in a zero net magnetic moment .",
    "conversely , each odd numbered cu@xmath4 cluster , has one unpaired electron , which attributes a net magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 .",
    "our calculated magnetic moments for the ground state structures of the n - capped as well as n - monodoped systems , are given in fig.[mes ] .",
    "it is seen that the magnetic moments of the mono - doped systems , also show an even - odd alteration , but with reversed period with respect to that of the corresponding pure systems . in other words ,",
    "a n@cu@xmath4 cluster has net magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 for the even values of @xmath5 and zero for the odd values of @xmath5 . considering the case of the ground state structure of the cu@xmath7n cluster ,",
    "there is some charge transfer from n to cu atoms due to hybridization between n-2@xmath14 and cu-@xmath31 orbitals .",
    "this results into net magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 which is solely contributed by the n atom .",
    "similarly for the mes of cu@xmath8n cluster , the @xmath13-electron of each cu atom gets paired with a @xmath14-electron of the n - atom as there is significant overlap between the cu and n atoms ( cf .",
    "[ mes ] ) , which now results into its zero net magnetic moment .",
    "the trend in the net magnetic moments in the subsequent cu@xmath4n clusters with @xmath32 3 , would be readily understandable .",
    "this is because of the fact that the systems having odd number of cu atoms in excess of 3 , such as for the cu@xmath10n and cu@xmath1n clusters , each also has one unpaired @xmath13 electron , which gives rise to 1 @xmath0 net magnetic moment .",
    "conversely , all the valence electrons are paired for a mono - doped system having even number of cu atoms in excess of 3 cu atoms such as cu@xmath19n cluster and it results again zero net magnetic moment .",
    "note this finding of the low magnetic moments of the n - monodoped cu@xmath4 clusters , is in direct contrast with the case of n - monodoped mn@xmath4 clusters , where giant magnetic moments have been predicted.@xcite    in contrast to the mono - doped systems , the optimal n - capped copper clusters show significantly enhanced magnetic moments . among the capped systems ,",
    "first the optimized cu@xmath7n@xmath7 cluster has a special structure where each cu atom is directly connected with both the n atoms and fulfills the perfect charge balance which results a zero net magnetic moment for it .",
    "however , the ground state structures of the other cu@xmath4n@xmath4 clusters have net magnetic moments of 8 @xmath0 , 10 @xmath0 , 12 @xmath0 and 14 @xmath0 respectively for @xmath18 3@xmath66 .",
    "we find that the enhanced magnetic moments of the capped systems , result from the ferromagnetic coupling among the all n - atoms as well as cu - atoms centered magnetic moments . in the n - capped cu@xmath4 clusters ,",
    "cu atoms become spin polarized because of charge transfer among the neighboring atoms .",
    "this spin polarization further magnetizes @xmath14-electrons of the n - atoms through @xmath14-@xmath9 hybridization .",
    "this hybridization in turn renders a ferromagnetic coupling state among all the constituent atoms . in order to understand the microscopic origin of the enhanced magnetic moments of the n - capped systems",
    ", we have performed the mullikan population analysis of spins.@xcite in table [ tab : bemag ] , we provide information on the magnetic moments at the cu and n sites for the ground state as well as first isomer of the n - capped clusters .",
    "we have also listed in table [ tab : bemag ] , their total spin , energy difference measured with respect to the ground state energy , values of @xmath33 bond - lengths and @xmath21 bond angles .",
    "the mullikan analysis yields an averaged spin magnetic moments of 0.3@xmath60.4 @xmath0 at the cu site and 1.3@xmath61.5 @xmath0 at the n - site .",
    "the important point to note is that the moments at cu - sites arise mainly from cu-@xmath9 orbital and from n-@xmath14 orbital in case of the n - sites .",
    "however , the major contribution to the enhanced magnetic moments of the n - capped clusters , arises from the n atoms .",
    "also note that the averaged magnetic moments at cu sites of the ground state structures of the capped clusters , though very small , show an overall decreasing trend with increasing cluster size .",
    "it , therefore , allows us to go one step forward in generalizing the net magnetic moments of the ground state structure of the four n - capped clusters by a formula 2@xmath282@xmath34 , where the first ` 2 ' denotes the magnetic moment contributed by the core of cu atoms , while ` 2@xmath34 ' is the magnetic moment contributed by the @xmath34 number of n atoms attached as capping .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation because the n - capping allows charge transfer from n - atoms to the cu - atoms and induces some magnetic moments to the cu atoms totaling around 2 @xmath0 for each capped system .",
    "for better understanding of magnetic coupling , we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ density ] the spin density surface corresponding to the ground state of the cu@xmath4n@xmath4 clusters in the upper panel and charge density contour plot corresponding to the ground state of the cu@xmath4n clusters in the lower panels for the size range @xmath18 3@xmath66 .",
    "it again clearly indicates the ferro magnetic coupling of the constituent atom - centered moments for the capped systems and enhanced hybridization tendency for the mono doped systems which results in their tiny net magnetic moments .",
    "we note that this enhanced ferromagnetism of the n - capped cu@xmath4 clusters , has a closed relevance to the observed ferromagnetism of a cu - doped gan system .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath14-@xmath9 hybridization mechanism is identified as the main factor for the ferromagnetic coupling of cu - dopants in gan.@xcite we have carried out separate studies of the magnetic coupling between two cu atoms in a gan crystal using a 32 atoms supercell .",
    "two cu atoms were substituted at different ga sites considering the various possibilities such as the near / far separation of the two dopants as well as their ferromagnetic / anti - ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "we found that in the mes of the 2cu@gan system , the coupling to be ferromagnetic with magnetic moments of 0.13 @xmath0 at each cu site .    in order to verify our gga - dft results discussed above ,",
    "we have also studied the small n - capped cu@xmath4 clusters using hybrid dft functional .",
    "we used a screened form of hybrid functional hse06 proposed by heyd , scuseria and ernzerhof with screening parameter 0.206.@xcite note that the hybrid hse06 functional has been used recently to correct gga - dft predictions of formation energy of transition metal oxide crystals@xcite as well as of magnetic interaction for transition metal clusters.@xcite we find that the overall trend of enhanced magnetic moments of the n - capped cu@xmath4 clusters persists as found in the case of pbe calculations . in hse calculations , we find that the n - atom centered magnetic moments get slightly increased and cu - atom centered magnetic moments decrease slightly .",
    "this is attributed to the less hybridization between n-@xmath14 and cu-@xmath9 orbitals .",
    "this is also reflected in slight increase of @xmath33 bond - lengths of the capped clusters in the hse calculations .",
    "it is thereby confirming that our result of the enhanced magnetic moments of the n - capped cu@xmath4 clusters is very robust irrespective of the choice of dft functionals .",
    "it is therefore , also very desirable to look for its experimental verification .",
    "recently , molecular beam deflection experiments have been employed to study magnetic moments of several capped transition metal clusters.@xcite such experiments would be useful in this respect .      to study the effect of endohedral doping in a n - capped cage - like cu cluster , we consider a particular case of a cu@xmath2 cluster .",
    "first , to determine the mes of a pure cu@xmath2 cluster , we have considered three most probable starting guessed structures , namely icosahedral ( ico ) , hexagonal bi - layered ( hbl ) and buckled bi - planar ( bbp ) structures . for the less symmetric hbl / bbp structures , all the 13 cu atoms lie on the surface , thereby forming a cage - like structure . the morphology of an icosahedral cu@xmath2 cluster can also be regarded as a cage of the twelve surface cu atoms , encapsulating another cu atom at the center of the cage .",
    "it is to be noted that previous works on small copper clusters indicate a rich variety of structures and the icosahedral symmetry based structure is predicted not to be the true ground state structure for a cu@xmath2 cluster.@xcite our calculated total binding energy and magnetic moment for the locally optimized three structures of the cu@xmath2 cluster , are 29.05 ev and 5 @xmath0 respectively for the optimal ico structure , 29.53 ev and 1 @xmath0 respectively for the optimal hbl structure and finally , 29.65 ev and 1 @xmath0 respectively for the optimal bbp structure .",
    "so it is the optimal bbp structure of a pure cu@xmath2 cluster which appears as its mes in our calculations .",
    "thereafter , each of the three structures was capped with n - atoms and we explored the potential energy surface to look for the mes of the n - capped cu@xmath2 cluster . to cap a hbl / bbp structure of the cu@xmath2 cluster ,",
    "total 13 n atoms have been used to bind with all its 13 surface cu atoms . on the other hand ,",
    "total 12 n atoms have been attached with its 12 surface cu atoms to cap the icosahedral cu@xmath2 cluster .",
    "then each structure of the n - capped cu@xmath2 cluster , has been optimized for all possible spin multiplicities . after structural optimization",
    ", it is seen that the estimated values of @xmath24/n - atoms are 1.81 ev , 1.64 ev and 1.65 ev for the optimal ico - cu@xmath2n@xmath3 , bbp - cu@xmath2n@xmath2 and hbl - cu@xmath2n@xmath2 clusters respectively .",
    "it is therefore , unambiguously showing that the n - capping to a cu@xmath2 cluster , favors an icosahedral cu@xmath2 core .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the optimized structure of the icosahedral cu@xmath2n@xmath3 cluster has a total magnetic moment of 29 @xmath0 which is very large compared to that of the pure optimal cu@xmath2 cluster and therefore , the sensitivity of enhanced magnetic moments of a n - capped cu@xmath4 cluster to cluster size , is beyond questionable .",
    "similar to the smaller n - capped cu@xmath4 clusters , the large magnetic moment of the cu@xmath2n@xmath3 cluster is contributed mainly by the spin polarized n atoms which carry in this case an average moment of around 1.4 @xmath0/n - atom .",
    "we note that there is a net charge transfer from the n atoms to the cu atoms , which creates partial occupancy in the 3@xmath9-orbital of the cu atoms and thereby , inducing spin polarization to them .",
    "mulliken population analysis shows that the n - capping in the icosahedral cu@xmath2 cluster creates a local magnetic moment of about 0.25 @xmath0/atom to the surface cu atoms . above all , the spin - polarized n atoms are ferromagnetically coupled among themselves and also with the cu - atom centered moments which results the giant net magnetic moment .",
    "the interesting point is that the magnetic moment of the cu@xmath2n@xmath3 cluster can be further improved by the substitution of the central cu atom by a cr atom .",
    "recently , the role of cr atom as an endohedral dopant for constructing molecular units of highly magnetic functionalized materials , has been investigated for hydrogenated si fullerenes.@xcite with this in view , we have explored the effects of cr substitution at one cu - site in the icosahedral cu@xmath2n@xmath3 cluster .",
    "we find that the optimized cr - doped cluster prefers to have the cr - substitution at the central site and it possesses a higher net magnetic moment of 34 @xmath0 along with a substantial energy gain of @xmath25 = 18.1 ev .",
    "it is also important to note that a optimized bare cu@xmath3cr cluster has zero net magnetic moment .",
    "therefore , the n - capped cr - encapsulated cu@xmath2 cluster shows significant improvement in magnetic moment as compared to that of the bare pure cu@xmath2 cluster as well as cu@xmath3cr cluster .",
    "though the magnetic moments of the cu and n atoms are enhanced after cr - substitution , it is the moment of the cr impurity which contributes the most to the extra magnetic moment of the cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 cluster as compared to that of the cu@xmath2n@xmath3 cluster .",
    "moreover , all the atomic moments are ferromagnetically aligned .",
    "[ pdos ] shows the spin density plots for the optimized structures of the cu@xmath2n@xmath3 and cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 clusters .",
    "it clearly indicates the ferromagnetic alignments of the constituents in the two systems .",
    "further , to understand the effects of n - cappings on the magnetic properties of the pure cu@xmath2 cluster and the endohedral cr - doped cu@xmath2 cluster , we have also plotted in the fig . [ pdos ] , the projected density of states ( pdos ) of the different species of atoms in the two systems .",
    "comparing the plot of the pdos of the optimized cu@xmath2n@xmath3 and cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 clusters , we see that there is hardly any changes in the cu - pdos and n - pdos between the two systems . for the cr - pdos of the cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 cluster ,",
    "there is , however , significant difference between its majority and minority spin channels , which indicates the large magnetic moment character of the cr atom .",
    "mulliken population analysis of spins shows that the unpaired electrons of the central cr - atom , indeed reside predominantly with it and do not appreciably hybridize with the cage atoms .",
    "this is also reflected in the lower value of @xmath25 for the optimal cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 cluster than that of the optimal cu@xmath2n@xmath3 cluster .",
    "the interaction of the central cr - atom with the cage - atoms seems largely mediated via the cr-4@xmath13 state , which is possibly also manifested by the observed symmetric position of the cr atom right at the center of the optimized cage .    to have a clear understanding of the nature of interactions of the central atom with the surrounding 12 cu atoms and",
    "also that of the capping agents , n atoms with the surface cu atoms , we have calculated the charge density difference , @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37cu@xmath3crn@xmath38 is the total charge density of the optimized cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 cluster and the rest are charge densities of the isolated atoms for each species .",
    "the @xmath28ve value of @xmath35 indicates accumulated charge and @xmath6ve value for the depleted charge .",
    "analysis of @xmath35 , therefore , gives us clues about the overall charge redistribution after introducing the cr atom at the central site .",
    "[ chg_transfer ] shows the plot of @xmath35 for the mess of the cu@xmath2n@xmath3 and cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 clusters .",
    "it clearly indicates more accumulation of charge at the central cr site of the cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 cluster , implying its high magnetic character and weak interaction with the surface cu - atoms .",
    "our mulliken population analysis shows that it results in a cr - atom - centered magnetic moment of around 3.2 @xmath0 and it is predominantly contributed by its @xmath9 orbital .",
    "in summary , n - capping is more promising than n - monodoping in inducing giant magnetic moment in a cu cluster .",
    "the n - capping is associated with enhanced hybridization of the valance @xmath14 orbitals of n atoms with the @xmath13-@xmath9 hybridized orbitals of the cu atoms and it induces spin polarization to the cu atoms .",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling among the constituent atoms gives rise to the giant magnetic moments for the capped systems .",
    "this study also shows that the magnetism of the n - capped cage - like structures of a cu cluster , can be enhanced further upon cr encapsulation .",
    "as the optimal cu@xmath3crn@xmath3 cluster possesses both enhanced hybridization among the valence orbitals of the constituent atoms as well as larger net magnetic moments , a cr - encapsulated cage - like structure of n - capped cu cluster , may be a better candidate for dilute magnetic semiconductors and experimental investigations in this direction would be exciting .",
