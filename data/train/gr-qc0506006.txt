    "the hawking radiation of black hole @xcite has got a deviation from thermal black - body spectrum of energy .",
    "a reason for such the grey - body spectrum is the quantum - mechanical rescattering of particle propagating from horizon to observer at infinity , by the gravitational potential of black hole .",
    "let us illustrate this point by the simplest case of schwarzschild black hole .",

    ", the action on a trajectory can be represented as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a conserved energy of massive particle , that defines the dimensionless integral of motion @xmath5 the hamilton ",

    "jacobi equation of ( [ u ] ) states the following : the total energy @xmath8 is the sum of kinetic term ( radial derivatives ) and potential term @xmath9 .",
    "the problem of radial motion is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ hpic1 ] , wherein we have depicted the ` potential ' and reflection of outgoing waves , which are shown schematically .        therefore , there is a nonzero coefficient of reflection , which causes the grey - body factors depending on the particle energy .",
    "the hawking radiation originates from vacuum fluctuations in vicinity of horizon .",
    "the virtual fluctuations are transformed to observed particles due to action of gravitational field .",
    "the pair of particles in fluctuation is separated by the field in the following way : the positive energy particle goes to infinity , while the negative energy particle falls behind the horizon diminishing the total mass of black hole in the exact balance with the radiated energy .    in actual analogy with reasons for the appearance of grey - body factors ,",
    "let us make the following question : can the rescattering of falling particle lead to its reflection by the black hole ?",
    "if such the reflection does exist , it could suppress the absorption of particle by the black hole , and , hence , particularly the hawking radiation , too .",
    "moreover , the total reflection would result in the complete stopping of hawking radiation .    in order to answer this question we use the quasi - classical thermal approach to the space - time behind the horizon as it was recently developed in @xcite .",
    "the introduction of such new framework is required by the consideration of trajectories completely confined behind the horizon .",
    "( [ u ] ) and fig .",
    "[ hpic1 ] clearly show that mentioned trajectories correspond to @xmath10 implying imaginary values of energy and time treated as the indication of statistical description .",
    "namely , the period of motion in imaginary time equals the inverse temperature of particles in thermal ensemble existing behind the horizon .",
    "the thermal equilibrium demanding the exact periodicity leads to the quasi - classical quantization the introduction of old bohr orbits for the particles confined behind the horizon . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the ground quantum state of schwarzschild black hole and its excitations in detail .",
    "we show how transitions between the excitations lead to the hawking radiation with the gibbs distribution in energy @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inverse temperature of black hole , and @xmath4 is the energy of radiation quantum .",
    "then we find the condition , when the hawking radiation is stopped : the black hole finishes to radiate , if all the excitations have transited to the ground state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we remind basic points in classifying the radial trajectories confined behind the horizon and develop the analysis by separating regular contributions described in @xcite and so - called `` mute '' terms , which are analogous to the dirac sea , since they are cancelled in the total energy and partition function .",
    "then we apply the energy conservation in order to describe excitations .",
    "the excitations are formed by energetic particles coupled with their `` antipodes '' , which have an opposite sign of euclidean energy . in section 3 we present the mechanism of particle absorption by the black hole and the limit of large quantum numbers for the hawking radiation , which , by derivation , obeys the gibbs distribution .",
    "the ground state of quantum black hole does not produce any hawking radiation .",
    "section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",

    "the examples of geodesics are shown in fig .",
    "[ hpic2 ] .    : the winding number equal to 4 is shown by solid arcs , the `` mute '' trajectory with the same @xmath21 is depicted by the dashed circle .",
    "the central point corresponds to the horizon at @xmath26 , while the solid circle is the singularity.,width=226 ]    however , due to the `` mute '' geodesics the particle can get a mixed regular - mute trajectories as shown in fig .",
    "[ hpic3 ] , since both geodesics are tangent at maximal distance from the singularity .",
    "we can say that the regular trajectory can adhere to the `` mute '' path at @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , one should determine a role of `` mute '' geodesics .        in this way ,",
    "let us , first , calculate the action on the mute trajectory ( @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 where the ` euclidean ' time is given by @xmath30 while @xmath31 is the ` euclidean ' energy , so that @xmath32",
    ". then , the action per period is @xmath33 emphasize , the `` mute '' action depends on the sign of energy @xmath34 .",
    "second , let us exploit the energy conservation . then , the total energy of black hole is its mass @xmath35 , which is a real number .",
    "the energy @xmath36 represents the imaginary contribution to the total energy .",
    "therefore , this contribution should be cancelled by opposite term .",
    "so , we * postulate * that for each particle on the `` mute '' geodesics there is the `` anti - mute '' particle with opposite energy .",
    "thus , the sum of actions will nullify : @xmath37 therefore , the `` mute''``anti - mute '' pair does not contribute to the total energy as well as to the partition function : the mute terms are cancelled .",
    "then , we can omit the mute part from the action in a full analogy with the dirac sea .",
    "however , `` mute '' pathes can contribute indirectly .",
    "indeed , for the regular term , the increment of action per cycle is given by @xmath38 note , it is independent on the sign of energy @xmath36",
    ". then , the action per period is determined by the increment and the number of cycles corrected by the phase belonging to the mute part , @xmath39 so that @xmath40 where we explicitly mark the maximal remoteness by the natural index of actual winding number in terms of @xmath41 : @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding term of mute path at the trajectory is given by @xmath43 by energy conservation , we * postulate * that the same trajectory with the opposite sign of energy should accompany the particle .",
    "for such the mirror trajectory , we call the `` antipode '' . then , the `` mute '' terms are cancelled again , while the regular contribution of particle ",
    "antipode pair is double : @xmath44 this postulate has two items .    _",

    "_ ii ) _ : :    excitations of ground level exist in the form of `` particle  antipode ''    pairs .    for definiteness , we have to fix the value of phase shift @xmath46 .",
    "a spectacular way is making use of correspondence principle : at large winding numbers the quasi - classical description has to match with the classical dynamics . in our case",
    "this principle implies the following :    the limit of @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "then , the phase increment is given by @xmath49 while @xmath50 therefore , @xmath51 where the positive energy of particle ",
    "antipode pair is defined by @xmath52 as we have demonstrated in @xcite , the action at such the trajectories with imaginary time contributes to the partition function in the standard way : @xmath53 which should restore the gibbs distribution in the classical limit of @xmath47 , @xmath54 then , the correspondence principle dictates @xmath55 where we remind that this prescription is valid for the excited levels , while at the ground level @xmath56 , since there are no `` mute '' trajectories for massive particles at @xmath26 ( the interval is exactly equal to zero ) .    at the moment , we can easily consider two limits in calculating the partition function .    1 .",
    "if all particles are at the ground level , then the sum of actions is reduced to the sum of particle masses @xmath57 where @xmath35 is the black hole mass : @xmath58 the thermodynamical function @xmath59 reproduces the correct value for the product of inverse temperature to the free energy @xmath60 @xmath61 2 .",

    ", the temperature is determined by the summed energy of other pairs , so that @xmath64 hence , the @xmath59 function is obtained by the integration @xmath65 which again reproduces the correct value",
    ".    one can easily recognize that the mixed situation can be described as a simple combination of two limits above .",
    "it is spectacular , that the mass of black hole is given by the sum of both masses for particles at the ground level and energies of particles and antipodes at excited levels .",

    "we start from the statement on the periodic motion @xmath67    in order to show the analogy with the quasi - classical quantization we can multiply by the winding number , so that @xmath68 this relation supports the interpretation of @xmath15 as the dynamical variable and @xmath69 as the canonically conjugated momentum of @xmath15 .",
    "next , we isolate the regular term , which is given by the integration over the distance , @xmath70 this regular term is a complete analogue of complex phase for the wavefunction in the quasi - classical approximation , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a dynamical variable , and @xmath73 is its momentum",

    "[ hpic1 ] shows that each reflection of trajectory at @xmath27 gives the additional phase equal to @xmath74 for the reflected wave with respect to the complex phase of wave falling to @xmath27 , and the additional phase equal to @xmath75 for the reflection at @xmath19 , since the potential wall at @xmath76 is infinitely high .",
    "the quasi - classical quantization by bohr  sommerfeld results in @xmath77 therefore , the true winding number at @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 the quantization by bohr ",
    "sommerfeld is quite accurate , if @xmath80 because of the following reason : in fact , we expect that the wavefunction should nullify at @xmath26 , which is possible , if both rising and falling exponents contribute at @xmath81 .",
    "however , we can neglect the rising exponent , which compensates the tail of falling exponent at @xmath26 , if @xmath82 . then",
    ", the rules applied are justified .",
    "the situation is slightly changed for the ground state , since the wavefunction should nullify at @xmath26 , which implies the complete reflection of wave at right return point .",
    "the corresponding phase between falling and reflected waves is equal to @xmath83 instead of @xmath74 .",
    "then , the regular equation for the winding number at the ground state is restored , @xmath84 in a full agreement with the consideration in @xcite .",
    "the above study supports the following representation of wavefunction at @xmath85 : @xmath86 @xmath87 which are identical at @xmath88 that restores the quantization rule .",
    "the modification for the ground state is transparent .",
    "this consideration provides us with the evidence for the reasonable treatment of quantum levels in the black hole .    in accordance with ( [ l5 ] ) , ( [ p5 ] ) and ( [ p6 ] ) , the quantum action per single particle takes discrete values shown in fig .",
    "[ pic4-corr ] , that slightly corrects naive fig . 5 of @xcite because of modified winding number .",
    "( 110,70 ) ( 10,0 ) ( 5,67)@xmath89 ( 110,0)@xmath69    thus , the quantum black hole is composed by the particles occupying the ground levels as well as the excited levels .",
    "the number of excitations depends on initial conditions before the collapse , which determine the mass of black hole .",
    "the spectrum of levels is discrete , though at high energy of excitation one could apply the classical description with the gibbs distribution .",
    "let us consider a change of state for the quantum black hole due to absorption of external particle falling behind the horizon .",

    "such the coherence could result in the holographic state @xcite : the state on the horizon sphere is equivalent to the quantum state of whole black hole .",
    "however , the strict statement requires an exact quantum theory of black holes , not the quasi - classical approximation , although we expect that the approximation used presents a rather valid qualitative picture for the quantum black hole .",
    "in short , we have described the inner quantum structure of schwarzschild black hole in the framework of quasi - classical thermal approach .",

    "what modifications have to be introduced , if we would involve neutral massless particles ?",
    "we expect that transitions of excited levels for massive particles to lower ones will produce the hawking radiation of such neutral massless particles , until all excitations decay to the ground level , again .",
    "then , the radiation will stop , since no energy can be extracted from the ground quantum state of black hole . in this way",
