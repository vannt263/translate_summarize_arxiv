    "with original motivation coming from physics @xcite , many authors investigated spacings and other statistical properties of various number - theoretic sequences , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . given a sequence @xmath5 equidistributed in the unit interval , the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution is obtained by ordering the first elements of the sequence @xmath6 , and then defining normalized spacings to be @xmath7 one can also consider next - to - nearest neighbor spacings or more generally , for any fixed @xmath8 , @xmath9 a function @xmath10 is called the limiting distribution function of @xmath11 as @xmath3 if , for any interval @xmath12 \\subset   [ 0,1)$ ] , @xmath13\\bigr\\ } = \\int_a^b p_\\ell(s)\\,ds.\\ ] ] if the points @xmath14 are independent uniformly distributed on @xmath15 $ ] random variables , we get the poisson model , with @xmath16 other widely used statistical measures are correlation functions .",
    "the pair correlation function for the sequence @xmath5 is defined by @xmath17 in the poisson model we have @xmath18 , as @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    ", we initiate a study of a similar problem for sequences arising from overlapping iterated function systems and non - standard digit expansions .",
    "for @xmath19 let @xmath20 we are interested in the randomness properties of these sets as @xmath3 .",
    "note that a point in @xmath21 may have more than one representation ; in other words , we may have `` coincidences . ''",
    "this will happen whenever @xmath4 is a zero of a polynomial with coefficients @xmath22 , which we call @xmath23 polynomials for short . in this case",
    "we take the point `` with multiplicity , '' so that our sequence always has size @xmath1 .",
    "consider the uniform measure @xmath24 on @xmath21 ; this is a discrete measure , with a point in @xmath21 having mass @xmath25 times the number of representations .",
    "it is well - known that for all @xmath4 , the measures @xmath24 converge vaguely to the infinite bernoulli convolution measure @xmath2 , defined as the distribution of the random series @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli random variables taking the values @xmath28 with equal probability .",
    "often @xmath29 are used as digits instead of @xmath28 ; this is just a linear change of variable .",
    "we also multiplied by @xmath30 , so that the measures are all supported on @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath31 is the interesting parameter range for this problem : for @xmath32 the measure @xmath2 is supported on a cantor set , and @xmath33 is just the set of binary rationals in @xmath34 with denominators less than @xmath1 ; also , for @xmath35 the ordering of @xmath21 agrees with the lexicographical ordering on @xmath36 .",
    "the measures @xmath2 , for @xmath19 , have been much studied , but are still rather mysterious , with many unsolved problems , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "besides mathematics , they come up in physics , information theory , and economics , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "briefly , it is known that @xmath2 is continuous for all @xmath4 , it is either purely absolutely continuous or purely singular , it is absolutely continuous for a.e .",
    "@xmath37 , and it is singular for pisot reciprocals ( see the definition below ) .",
    "it is an open problem whether these are the only exceptions .",
    "the only explicitly known @xmath4 for which @xmath2 is absolutely continuous are garsia reciprocals ( see the definition below ) , which include @xmath38 , for @xmath39 . moreover , the roots of @xmath40 are the only parameters for which the density is explicitly computable .",
    "( when we talk about `` density of @xmath2 '' in this paper , we mean the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath41 . )",
    "let @xmath42 be the ordering of @xmath21 , counting with multiplicity , so that @xmath43 spacing statistics provide a measure of randomness for the sequences @xmath44 approximating @xmath2 .",
    "numerical evidence seems to indicate that , for a typical @xmath4 , there exist level spacing distributions . however , we first need to rescale the sequence .",
    "let @xmath45 these sequences are uniformly distributed modulo one , in the sense that for any interval @xmath12 \\subset [ 0,1]$ ] , the number of points @xmath46 in @xmath12 $ ] divided by @xmath1 tends to @xmath47 .",
    "( this follows from the fact that @xmath2 is continuous , hence the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath48 converges to the cdf of @xmath2 everywhere . )    * conjecture 1 . * _ for almost every @xmath49 the rescaled sequences @xmath46 are distributed according to the poisson model .",
    "_    we have numerical evidence in support of this conjecture , however , proving it seems far beyond our reach .",
    "a key difficulty is that very few measures @xmath2 are known explicitly .",
    "therefore , we mostly focus on the pair correlation function for the non - rescaled sequences @xmath50 which provide information about the variance of average spacings .",
    "a more modest goal than proving conjecture 1 would be to verify the following    * conjecture 2 . * _ for almost every @xmath49 , there exist @xmath51 such that @xmath52 _",
    "this would mean that our sequences exhibit * no attraction * and * no repulsion*. our main results ( theorems 2.1 and 2.3 ) makes a step in this direction , but we have to do averaging over the parameter @xmath4 .    note that for certain @xmath4 the behavior of the spacings is definitely not poissonian .",
    "for example , let @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a pisot number , that is , an algebraic integer @xmath55 whose conjugates are all less than one in modulus . such @xmath2 , with @xmath49 , are the only singular infinite bernoulli convolutions known @xcite . in this case",
    ", garsia s lemma @xcite says that the spacings between distinct points in @xmath21 are all bounded below by @xmath56 , which implies that there are `` massive '' coincidences , since @xmath57 spacings are zeros .",
    "this is an extreme case of attraction .",
    "something similar happens for all zeros of @xmath23 polynomials .",
    "on the other hand , consider the case of `` garsia numbers . ''",
    "we say that @xmath54 is garsia if it is a zero of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients and constant term @xmath58 , whose conjugates are all greater than one in modulus .",
    "garsia reciprocals include @xmath38 for @xmath59 , but also many other numbers ( e.g.  the reciprocal of the positive root of @xmath60 , which is about @xmath61 , or the reciprocal of the positive root of @xmath62 , which is about @xmath63 ) .",
    "garsia reciprocals @xmath4 are the only _ specific _ ( as opposed to generic ) @xmath19 for which it is known that @xmath2 is absolutely continuous , and moreover , they have bounded density .",
    "again by garsia s lemma @xcite , it is known that the spacings between points in @xmath21 are bounded below by @xmath64 , and there are no coincidences .",
    "this is an extreme case of repulsion .",
    "it is interesting to compare our situation with that for sequences @xmath65 mod 1 , for irrational @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "it is conjectured that for @xmath66 badly approximable by rationals the spacing distribution is poissonian , and partial results in this direction are obtained in @xcite , in particular , for a.e .",
    "@xmath66 , the pair correlations converge to @xmath68 as @xmath3 . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "show that for some irrational @xmath66 the behavior of spacings is different . in our problem",
    ", we prove that for @xmath4 which are extremely well - approximable by zeros of @xmath23 polynomials , the pair correlation function @xmath69 exhibits some attraction ( theorem 2.2 ) .",
    "there are several difficulties in pushing our results further ; one of them is that the distribution of zeros of @xmath23 polynomials is not well - understood .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , we can not say anything about higher - order correlations ; this is related to hard open problems on bernoulli convolutions .",
    "a technical assumption which we have to make in some results is that the parameter @xmath4 belongs to the `` transversality interval , '' that is , an interval where @xmath23 power series can not have double zeros .",
    "transversality @xcite has been crucially important in the work on @xmath2 .",
    "we note that there are some features of our sequences which are `` non - random . '' in particular , some spacings tend to have very high multiplicity , in other words , the distribution of non - rescaled spacings sometimes exhibit `` spikes . ''",
    "this is explained by the fact that every spacing @xmath70 is a zero of a @xmath23 polynomial . for every such polynomial with @xmath71 zero coefficients ,",
    "the same difference between points in @xmath21 will be achieved @xmath72 times .",
    "if @xmath70 is a very small number , it is likely to be a spacing , and if @xmath73 is small , we will see a  spike . \"",
    "this irregularity should dissappear after rescaling by the cdf of @xmath2 .",
    "further , it turns out that the smallest spacing between points of @xmath21 , for a.e .",
    "@xmath4 in a transversality interval , is bounded below by @xmath74 , for infinitely many @xmath75 , for any @xmath76 ( follows from theorem 2.4 ) , which is much larger than @xmath77 which we would get if the points were sampled randomly and independently from the uniform distribution .    in figures 1 - 3",
    "we show the histogram of the distribution of nearest - neighbor spacings and also spacings with @xmath78 for the rescaled points @xmath79 , where @xmath80 was obtained from a random number generator , uniformly in the interval @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "it was chosen so as to be reasonably close to @xmath82 for which the cdf of the infinite bernoulli convolution measure is known precisely , and this cdf was used for the rescaling .",
