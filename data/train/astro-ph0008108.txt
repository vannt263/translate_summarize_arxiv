    "to clarify the mechanism of collapse - driven supernovae ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) necessitates understanding of the properties of matter under extreme conditions characterized by high densities and temperatures as well as of its interactions with electron neutrinos , which are produced by electron capture processes on the nuclei present during the collapse of an iron core of a massive star .",
    "diffusion of the neutrinos thus produced is controlled by their coherent scattering off the nuclei via neutral - current weak interactions @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that at densities above @xmath5 g @xmath6 , where the dynamical time scale of the collapse is small compared with the diffusion time scale , these neutrinos are trapped , forming an ultrarelativistic and degenerate fermi gas .",
    "this plays a role in establishing @xmath7 equilibrium in the system equilibrated material is referred to as supernova matter . ] and , until the core ceases to collapse and rebounds , in increasing the system temperature @xmath8 up to order or greater than 10 mev .",
    "the density region in which such a trapping occurs and the lepton fraction , i.e. , the number of the leptons of electron flavor present per nucleon locally in this region : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the nucleon , electron and electron - neutrino number densities , respectively , depend on the rates of the electron capture and of the neutrino scattering .",
    "these rates are in turn affected by changes in the states of supernova matter such as changes in the nuclear composition and a melting transition from the phase with the nuclei to the phase of uniform nuclear matter .    at subnuclear densities and at temperatures below the critical temperature of order 10 mev , nuclear matter is separated into a high - density liquid part , usually characterized by roughly spherical nuclei , and a low - density gas part , composed mostly of neutrons .",
    "when the density is close to the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath13 g @xmath6 , the system is expected to have rod - like and slab - like nuclei as well as rod - like and roughly spherical bubbles , as originally indicated by ravenhall et al .",
    "@xcite and hashimoto et al .",
    "@xcite using a liquid drop model in the zero - temperature approximation .",
    "these earliest investigations show that such non - spherical nuclei and bubbles , forming a coulomb lattice , arise from a delicate balance between the interfacial energy and the electrostatic energy including the lattice energy . with increasing density , a bcc lattice of spherical nuclei changes into a two - dimensional triangular lattice of rod - like nuclei and then into a one - dimensional layered lattice of slab - like nuclei , until the liquid part and the gas part begin to be replaced by each other .",
    "after further transformations to a two - dimensional triangular lattice of cylindrical bubbles and then to a bcc lattice of spherical bubbles , the system turns into uniform nuclear matter .",
    "this behavior was confirmed by lassaut et al .",
    "@xcite in their three - dimensional thomas - fermi calculations at finite @xmath14 and @xmath8 relevant to stellar collapse .",
    "those kinds of non - spherical nuclei and of bubbles are often referred to as nuclear `` pasta '' since they are similar in shape to spaghetti , lasagna , etc .",
    "the presence of non - spherical nuclei and of bubbles is expected to have consequence to the hydrodynamics and neutrino transport in supernova cores ; these are ingredients of a simulation study of stellar collapse , bounce and explosion ( for recent progress in this study , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "let us first note that the neutrino wavelengths , typically of order 20 fm , are comparable to or even greater than the internuclear spacing , leading to diffractive effects on the neutrino elastic scattering off such a periodic spatial structure of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "these effects , induced by the internuclear coulombic correlations , would act to reduce the scattering rates and hence the lepton fraction @xmath14 . for the bcc lattice of spherical nuclei ,",
    "such a reduction was examined by horowitz @xcite by calculating the associated static structure factor .",
    "as clarified by bruenn and mezzacappa @xcite in their numerical calculations of stellar collapse , however , the resultant window that allows low - energy neutrinos to diffuse away from the core during its collapse is too narrow to drastically suppress the degree of the neutrino degeneracy .",
    "it is also noteworthy that non - spherical nuclei and bubbles are elongated in specific direction . in such direction ,",
    "the neutrino scattering processes are no longer coherent , in contrast to the case of roughly spherical nuclei whose finiteness in any direction yields constructive interference in the scattering .",
    "the last point to be mentioned is that the changes in the nuclear shape are accompanied by discontinuities in the adiabatic index , denoting how hard the equation of state of the material is . as lassaut",
    "@xcite suggested , these discontinuities may influence the core hydrodynamics during the initial phase of the collapse .    for neutron star matter , which has vanishing neutrino degeneracy , we examined the density region in which the phases with non - spherical nuclei and with bubbles are preferred over the bcc phase of spherical nuclei and the homogeneous phase by generalizing a compressible liquid - drop model advanced by baym , bethe and pethick @xcite ( hereafter bbp ) so as to incorporate uncertainties in the nuclear surface tension @xmath1 and the proton chemical potential @xmath2 in the dripped neutron gas @xcite .",
    "we found that as @xmath1 decreases or @xmath2 increases , such a density region is enlarged appreciably .",
    "fortunately , those uncertainties are of less importance to supernova matter at subnuclear densities , which will be studied in the present paper .",
    "this is because after the onset of the neutrino trapping , the resultant neutrino degeneracy keeps the denser part of nuclear matter stable against further neutronization ; not only does the proton fraction @xmath15 in this part remain typically of order 0.3 , not far from the regime accessible to experiment , but also the dripped nucleon gas , arising mainly from thermal effects , is too low for the values of @xmath2 to make any essential difference in the density region occupied by nuclear `` pasta '' . to be taken into account in analyzing supernova matter , in addition to the nuclear model dependence of the stability of the `` pasta '' phases ,",
    "is its dependence on the trapped lepton fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 , depending on the sizes and shapes of the denser part which produces , scatters and absorbs electron neutrinos via weak interactions , exert feedback on the condition for the stability of the `` pasta '' phases .",
    "note , for example , that with increasing @xmath0 , the melting density @xmath16 approaches @xmath17 .",
    "this is due to the tendency @xcite that as the denser part is at larger neutron excess , the saturation density is lowered . by allowing for uncertainties in @xmath0 coming partly from such a feedback effect , we set a range of @xmath0 as @xmath18 , rather wider than the usually adopted values ranging 0.30.38 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the equilibrium phase diagrams of zero - temperature supernova matter are drawn for this range of @xmath0 ; we thus find that at typical values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 , the phases with rod - like and slab - like nuclei lie between the usual bcc phase and the uniform phase , as in the case of neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "for these two `` pasta '' phases , we evaluate thermally induced displacements of the nuclei from their elastic constants , which were described by pethick and potekhin @xcite in terms of the interfacial and electrostatic energies .",
    "they noted that the low - dimensional spatial order exhibited by the phases with cylindrical and planar nuclei is analogous to that of the liquid crystals , i.e. , columnar phases and smectics a , respectively . according to our previous analysis of neutron star matter @xcite",
    ", thermal fluctuations may melt the layered lattice of planar nuclei rather than the triangular lattice of cylindrical nuclei at temperatures appropriate to matter in neutron star crusts . in the case of supernova cores of interest here , as we shall see , not only the temperature scale but also the elastic constants are considerably large as compared with the case of neutron star crusts .",
    "the temperatures and elastic constants thus increased play a role in enhancing and suppressing the fluctuational displacements , respectively .",
    "the resultant rivalry between these two roles is finally examined .    in section 2 , a compressible liquid - drop model for nuclei and bubbles ,",
    "together with the associated equilibrium conditions , is designed to describe zero - temperature matter at subnuclear densities and various lepton fractions . in section 3",
    "we therefrom derive the equilibrium phase diagrams for changes in the nuclear conformation .",
    "properties of such conformation changes are discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we estimate displacements of rod - like and slab - like nuclei at finite temperatures .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we construct the free energy of supernova matter for densities near the melting density @xmath16 , and write down the conditions for its equilibrium .",
    "we concentrate on the influence of the lepton fraction @xmath0 on the free energy . since the finite - temperature effects on the free energy , i.e. , nuclear and electronic excitations , nucleon evaporation from the denser part of nuclear matter , multiple shapes and sizes of this part , etc . , are of less importance , the temperature @xmath8 is taken to be zero .",
    "all we bear in mind is thus to combine the bbp - type compressible liquid - drop model used by us @xcite for the description of zero - temperature , inhomogeneous nuclear matter embedded in a sea of electrons with the energy contribution of electron neutrinos . at @xmath19 , the less dense part of nuclear matter",
    "is composed entirely of the neutrons dripped out of the denser part .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider five phases characterized by the shapes of the denser part of nuclear matter , i.e. , sphere , cylinder , slab , cylindrical hole and spherical hole , respectively ; each phase is composed of a single species of nucleus or bubble at a given baryon density @xmath10 and lepton fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the wigner - seitz approximation is adopted in describing the energy of the respective coulomb lattice : a cell in the bcc lattice , including a spherical nucleus or bubble of radius @xmath20 , is replaced by a spherical wigner - seitz cell having the same center and radius @xmath21 ; a cell in the two - dimensional triangular lattice , including a cylindrical nucleus or bubble having an infinitely long axis and a circular section of radius @xmath20 , is replaced by a cylindrical wigner - seitz cell having the same axis and a circular section of radius @xmath21 ; a cell in the one - dimensional layered lattice , including a planar nucleus with width @xmath22 , is equivalent to a planar wigner - seitz cell having the same central plane and width @xmath23 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 for these phases are chosen so that each wigner - seitz cell may have zero net charge .",
    "let us now regard each species of leptons ( nucleons ) as uniformly distributed everywhere in the system ( inside and outside the nuclei or bubbles ) , and write down the total energy density @xmath24 of the system as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the energy of the nuclear matter region ( the region containing protons ) in a cell as divided by the cell volume ; @xmath27 is the lattice energy per unit volume as given for the nuclei or bubbles having nonzero @xmath20 ; @xmath28 is the number density of neutrons outside the nuclei or inside the bubbles ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energy densities of the neutron matter , of the electron gas and of the neutrino gas , respectively ; @xmath32 is the volume fraction occupied by the nuclei or bubbles .    in eq .",

    "this expression for @xmath26 includes three parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , associated with uncertainties in the proton chemical potential @xmath2 in pure neutron matter as contained in @xmath39 and those in the nuclear surface tension @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath47 determines the magnitude of @xmath2 ( not including the rest mass ) as ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath51 we basically set @xmath52 mev @xmath53 ; this case is consistent with the generally accepted behavior among recent literature as exhibited in fig .  1 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as the case may be , @xmath54 mev @xmath53 will be also taken for the sake of comparison .",
    "the other two parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined as ( eq .  ( 6 ) in @xcite ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the neutron chemical potential in the neutron gas ( not including the rest mass ) , and @xmath57 is the bbp - type surface tension ( eq .",

    "it is important to examine whether or not this tendency persists for the ground - state supernova matter ; in this case , the proton fraction @xmath15 of interest is considerably large relative to the case of @xmath58 in which it is confined to @xmath62 . when we still set @xmath60 and @xmath61 mev , as can be seen from fig .  1 , the surface tension calculated from the equilibrium conditions to be described in subsection 2.2 agrees fairly well with the rbp results for @xmath52 mev @xmath53 and @xmath63 . and for densities of interest here",

    "] such agreement has been confirmed also for @xmath54 mev @xmath53 and @xmath63 . in the present work ,",
    "we thus give @xmath49 a fixed value , 3.5 mev , and @xmath48 a range of values including unity , 0.013 .",
    "zero - temperature supernova matter with nuclei or bubbles of given shape , in its equilibrium , fulfills the conditions for stability of the nuclear matter region against change in the size , neutron drip , @xmath7-decay and pressurization , as in the case of neutron star matter ( see section 2.2 in ref .",

    "the solution for @xmath68 can then be written in terms of @xmath38 , @xmath15 , @xmath28 and @xmath20 by using the cardan s formula . for the rest of the process that allows us to find the equilibrium values of @xmath38 , @xmath15 , @xmath28 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and thus the minimum value of @xmath24",
    ", we can follow a line of argument of ref .",
    "@xcite .    at the same @xmath10 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the energy density of uniform nuclear matter in @xmath7-equilibrium with leptons has also been evaluated .",
    "the total energy density of this uniform system is written as @xmath73c^2 + e_{\\rm e}(n_{\\rm e})+e_{\\nu}(n_{\\nu})\\ , \\ ] ] where the presence of muons is ignored .",
    "we then minimize @xmath24 with respect to @xmath15 at fixed baryon density @xmath74 and lepton fraction @xmath0 as well as subject to charge neutrality , @xmath75 the resultant @xmath7-equilibrium condition , given by @xmath76 leads to the optimal value of @xmath15 and hence of @xmath24 . by comparing this value of @xmath24 with the values obtained for the five crystalline phases ,",
    "we have determined the phase giving the smallest energy density at various values of @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and thereby drawn the phase diagrams for the ground - state supernova matter , as plotted in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "let us first examine the @xmath2 and @xmath1 dependence of the density region of each phase ; such dependence can be typically seen from fig .",
    "2 that exhibits the phase diagram drawn at @xmath79 and @xmath80 mev @xmath81 over the @xmath10 versus @xmath48 plane .",
    "we have thus confirmed the feature as mentioned in section 1 that the density region where neither the usual bcc phase nor the uniform phase is stable is almost independent of @xmath2 because of negligibly small @xmath28 .",
    "we remark in passing that the melting density @xmath16 increases with increasing @xmath77 ( lowering @xmath2 ) , in contrast to the case of neutron star matter ( see fig .  3 in ref .",
    "this is because such a change in @xmath2 helps the nuclear matter region keep the protons within itself , rather than the neutron gas region share the protons .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence , on the other hand , is essentially the same as that obtained for neutron star matter : not only is the density region occupied by nuclear `` pasta '' reduced with increasing @xmath48 , but also the sequence of the nuclear shape for the lower @xmath1 ( @xmath82 ) , i.e. , sphere @xmath83 cylinder @xmath83 slab @xmath83 cylindrical hole @xmath83 spherical hole @xmath83 uniform matter ( with increasing @xmath84 ) , changes into sphere @xmath83 cylinder @xmath83 slab @xmath83 uniform matter for the typical @xmath1 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , it is to be recalled that uncertainties accompanying @xmath48 are smaller for supernova matter than for neutron star matter ( see section 1 ) .",
    "we proceed to consider the @xmath0 dependence of the phase diagrams by observing fig .  3 drawn for @xmath86 and for @xmath87 mev @xmath81 .",
    "for these values of @xmath0 , within the typical @xmath1 region ( @xmath88 ) , the phase with slab - like nuclei dissolves into uniform matter without undergoing a transition to the phase with cylindrical or spherical bubbles . the most viable situation in which at least one of the bubble phases is energetically favored for a finite range of density",
    "is expected in a rather hypothetical parameter region , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is interesting to note that as @xmath0 increases , the melting density @xmath16 goes up and becomes close to @xmath17 . as mentioned in section 1 , this is due to the proton fraction dependence of the saturation density ; for details , see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite that shows the bbp model for the energy of bulk nuclear matter underlying @xmath39 used here .",
    "we also find that the density region occupied by nuclear `` pasta '' is considerably larger than that displayed by fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite for neutron star matter having a lepton fraction of order 0.03 and a surface tension of order 0.1 mev @xmath91 .",
    "this is because such a density region is controlled by the tendency towards reduction in the total surface area , which is in turn determined by @xmath1 and hence by @xmath0 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this tendency communicates with the fact that for supernova matter , the energy difference between two successive phases is generally of order 1 - 10 kev per nucleon ( see fig .  4 ) ,",
    "an order of magnitude larger than that for neutron star matter ( see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we conclude this section by asking why the bubble phases do not appear in the equilibrium phase diagrams for our typical nuclear model ( @xmath87 mev @xmath81 and @xmath60 ) in contrast with the results obtained by lassaut et al .",
    "@xcite in their three - dimensional thomas - fermi calculations using a skyrme nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "as expected from a simple liquid - drop argument of the electrostatic and interfacial effects ignoring the bulk energy @xcite , they found that all the phases with non - spherical nuclei and with bubbles occur for a finite range of pressure ( or density ) .",
    "we ascribe this contrast primarily to the difference in the adopted properties of bulk nuclear matter at a proton fraction of about 0.3 ; description of these properties relies on interpolation between the fairly - well - determined properties of pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this ascription is supported by the speculation that the role of curvature corrections in stabilizing the phases with bubbles relative to the phases with nuclei , which was allowed for in ref .",
    "@xcite but has been disregarded in the present work , is not sufficient to cause the bubble phases to appear in the vicinity of @xmath92 on the phase diagrams .",
    "such insufficiency can be viewed from fig .",
    "5 , in which the curvature energy gain per nucleon for spherical bubbles over for planar nuclei and the difference in energy per nucleon between the phases with spherical bubbles and with planar nuclei have been compared for @xmath79 , @xmath87 mev @xmath81 and @xmath60 . , the phase with cylindrical bubbles is less favorable than that with spherical bubbles even in the absence of the curvature corrections which lower the energy for the spherical - bubble phase further than that for the cylindrical - bubble phase . ]",
    "the curvature energy for given conformation is expressed per nucleon as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the curvature thermodynamic potential per unit length .",
    "we have set the values of @xmath94 , which have yet to be determined well even at proton fractions near @xmath95 , as @xmath96 mev @xmath97 by reference to the estimates , @xmath980.2 mev @xmath97 at @xmath99 , made by kolehmainen et al .",
    "@xcite in the thomas - fermi theory with skyrme interactions .",
    "figure 5 indicates that for the typical parameter set leading to @xmath99 , the value of @xmath94 required by the presence of the bubble phases is at least @xmath100 mev @xmath97 , considerably larger than the estimates referred to . for @xmath1010.2 mev @xmath97",
    ", all the curvature corrections contribute to the vicinity of @xmath92 on the phase diagrams is to lower the transition density from sphere to cylinder and that from cylinder to slab by several tens percent and to accordingly enlarge the density region surrounded by the bcc phase and the uniform phase .",
    "at a pressure at which the transition between one nuclear shape and another occurs , various quantities such as @xmath10 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath38 , @xmath15 and @xmath28 are more or less discontinuous because of the dependence of the interfacial and electrostatic energies on the dimensionality @xmath43 ( see eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 8) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as can be derived from fig .  4 by implementing the double - tangent constructions denoting the coexistence of the two neighbouring phases , the discontinuity in @xmath10 amounts to of order 1% . due to such a weak first - order nature of the transition , the transition point , properly characterized by a constant pressure ,",
    "is well described by a constant density determined by the comparison between the total energy densities for the respective phases .",
    "let us then examine the changes in the sizes of the nucleus or bubble and of the wigner - seitz cell , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , associated with the structural transitions . in fig .",
    "6 we have plotted the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 evaluated as functions of @xmath10 for @xmath79 , @xmath87 mev @xmath81 and @xmath102 .",
    "discontinuities in @xmath20 and @xmath21 at the transition points have been thus clarified . in the case of @xmath103",
    "in which all the five crystalline phases appear , we observe the same dimensionality dependence of @xmath21 as observed for neutron star matter ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , it is largest for @xmath46 ( spheres and cylindrical holes ) and smallest for @xmath44 ( slabs ) .",
    "we finally address the question of how the neutron densities outside and inside the nuclear matter region change as the system melts into uniform nuclear matter .",
    "comparison of these densities with the one for the uniform phase has been made in fig .",
    "7 for @xmath0=0.3 , @xmath77=400 mev @xmath81 and @xmath104 .",
    "we can observe from this figure that for densities up to the melting point , the density of the dripped neutron gas remains negligibly small compared with the neutron density inside the nuclear matter region .",
    "this behavior , which stems from the neutrino trapping ( see section 1 ) and manifests itself for the other values of @xmath0 and @xmath77 , is consistent with the results obtained by ogasawara and sato @xcite in their thomas - fermi calculations at various values of @xmath0 and zero temperature .",
    "we also find from the comparison of fig .  7 with fig .  6 in ref .",
    "@xcite that the difference in the neutron density profiles between the crystalline and uniform phases at the melting point is remarkable in contrast with the case of neutron star matter , in which the neutron density profile is fairly levelled just below the melting point . in supernova matter , in which neighbouring nuclei ( or bubbles )",
    "appear to touch and fuse each other at the melting point , neutrino elastic scattering off nuclear `` pasta '' is thus expected to take effect until it becomes uniform .",
    "given occurrence of the phases with rod - like and slab - like nuclei as expected for typical values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 from the zero - temperature phase diagrams exhibited in the previous section , we turn to the estimates of thermally induced displacements of these nuclei from their equilibrium positions . in making such estimates , we utilize the expressions for such displacements that were written in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the elastic constants @xcite controlling small deformation of the nuclei . for the layered lattice of slab - like nuclei ,",
    "the mean square of the displacement @xmath105 of layers in their normal direction reads ( eq .  ( 36 ) in ref .",

    "( 28 ) and ( 29 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively , and the length scale @xmath111 of the lattice is assumed to be far larger than @xmath21 .",
    "for the two - dimensional triangular lattice of rod - like nuclei , the mean square of the displacement vector @xmath112 of cylinders in a plane perpendicular to their elongated direction is expressed as ( eq .  ( 37 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath109 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the elastic constants given by eqs .",
    "( 31 ) , ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively , @xmath117 is the lattice constant for hexagonal cells , and the linear dimension of the lattice in the plane including @xmath112 is assumed to be much larger than @xmath21 and to be much smaller than the length of the nuclei .",
    "it is important to notice that all the elastic constants , derived by pethick and potekhin @xcite from the calculations of the electrostatic and interfacial energy increase due to the nuclear deformation , are proportional to the electrostatic energy density , @xmath118 , given by eq .",
    "( 8) in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath118 in turn behaves as @xmath119 , the non - spherical nuclei in supernova cores are more difficult to deform than those in neutron star crusts .",
    "as was noted in @xcite concerning the crossover temperature @xmath120 from the quantum - fluctuation to the thermal - fluctuation regime , expressions ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) hold for @xmath121 but underestimate the displacements for @xmath122 . in the case of supernova matter considered here , @xmath120 can be roughly estimated to be of order @xmath123 k for planar nuclei and of order @xmath124 k for cylindrical nuclei .",
    "let us then ask how large the root - mean - square displacement @xmath125 of a planar or cylindrical nucleus is relative to the shortest distance , @xmath126 , between the surface of the nucleus in its equilibrium position and the boundary of the cell containing it .",
    "the ratio of these two lengths for the planar ( cylindrical ) nucleus has been plotted in fig .",
    "8 ( 9 ) at @xmath127 mev and @xmath128 km , appropriate to the subnuclear density regime inside supernova cores ; the @xmath111 dependence of the displacement , which is logarithmic , makes little differences .",
    "we can find from these figures the dominance of the relative displacement of the planar nucleus over that of the cylindrical nucleus , yielded by the logarithmic factor appearing in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , as well as the suppression of the relative displacements by @xmath1 , which were obtained also for neutron star crusts ( see figs .  7 and 8 in ref .",
    "this @xmath1 dependence then communicates with the suppression of the relative displacements by @xmath14 as exhibited in figs .",
    "8 and 9 via the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath14 shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in examining the competition between the influences of temperature and of elasticity as pointed out in section 1 , it is noteworthy that the relative displacements thus obtained are larger than those obtained for neutron star crusts by less than a factor of ten .",
    "this is because the influence of the difference in the typical temperature by two orders - of - magnitude surpasses that of the above - mentioned difference in the elasticity of the nucleus . in case we set the melting condition as @xmath129 , the enhanced relative displacements in supernova cores",
    "do not modify our previous conclusion @xcite obtained for neutron star crusts that the triangular lattice of rod - like nuclei is stable against thermal fluctuations for our typical nuclear model , but change the conclusion about the layered lattice of slab - like nuclei from its marginal instability @xcite depending on the nuclear models to its instability almost independent of them .",
    "given uncertainties in the temperature profile of the core , it is useful to estimate the critical temperature @xmath130 at which the relative displacements become unity ; the results for @xmath130 have been plotted in figs .  10 and 11 for the layered lattice and the triangular lattice , respectively .",
    "the dependence on the lepton fraction @xmath0 of the phase diagrams associated with the changes in the nuclear shape has been studied for zero - temperature supernova matter at subnuclear densities .",
    "we have found that with increasing @xmath0 , the density region occupied by the `` pasta '' phases , i.e. , the phases with non - spherical nuclei and with bubbles , becomes larger . despite the considerable increase in the lepton fraction from neutron star matter , leading to enhancement of the proton fraction in the nuclear matter region and suppression of the density of the dripped neutron gas , not only the sequence of the nuclear shape ( sphere @xmath83 cylinder @xmath83 slab @xmath83 uniform with increasing density ) obtained for the typical nuclear model but also",
    "the effectiveness of thermal fluctuations at the dissolution of slab - like nuclei has been shown to be analogous to the case of neutron star matter .",
    "the actual presence of nuclear `` pasta '' in supernova cores depends on how the uncertain properties of bulk nuclear matter having a proton fraction of order 0.3 affect the stability of the `` pasta '' and on whether or not the time needed to form the `` pasta '' is small compared with the time scale of stellar collapse .",
    "if future work about these questions were in favor of the occurrence of the `` pasta '' , it would be significant to calculate the finite - temperature equation of state and neutrino transport in the presence of the `` pasta '' phases and to incorporate them into a supernova simulation with a neutrino radiation hydrodynamics code .",
    "this would clarify the influence of the `` pasta '' on the lepton fraction at the onset of the neutrino trapping .",
