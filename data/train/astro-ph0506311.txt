    "gliese86 ( thereafter gl86 ) is a k1 dwarf located at a distance of 10.9@xmath20.08pc ( hipparcos , esa 1997 ) .",
    "queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a 15.8day periodical variation of its radial velocity . because gl86 does not show any chromospheric activity or photometric variability they concluded that the variation of the radial velocity is induced by an exoplanet with a minimum mass of 4@xmath3 on an almost circular orbit ( e=0.046 , a=0.11au ) .",
    "furthermore they reported a long - term linear trend in the radial velocity data ( 0.5 m s@xmath4 d@xmath4 ) observed over a time span of 20 years in the coravel program and also confirmed by coralie measurements ( 0.36 m s@xmath4 d@xmath4 ) .",
    "this is a clear signature of a further stellar companion in the gl86 system with a period longer than 100yr ( a@xmath520au ) .",
    "els et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found a faint companion 2arcsec east of gl86 which clearly shares common proper motion .",
    "they also obtained near infrared photometry ( j=14.7@xmath20.2 , h=14.4@xmath20.2 , and k=13.7@xmath20.2 ) and from the derived color ( j - k@xmath01 ) they concluded that gl86b must be substellar with a spectral type between late l to early t. however a substellar companion ( m@xmath678@xmath3 ) can not explain the detected long term trend in the radial velocity of the exoplanet host star .    at the begin of 2005 we started a search for faint substellar companions of all exoplanet host stars known to harbor several substellar companions , i.e. several planets or as in the case of gl86 one planet and a reported brown dwarf companion ( see els et al .",
    "our goal is to detect additional companions .",
    "we carry out our observations with naco / vlt and its new simultaneous differential imaging device sdi which is particular sensitive for faint cool substellar companions exhibiting strong methane absorption features ( t dwarfs ) , yielding a much higher contrast than standard ao imaging with naco alone .",
    "all our targets are main - sequence stars with ages in the range of 1 to 10gyrs . from theoretical models ( baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) we expected that most of the substellar companions of our targets are t dwarfs cooler 1400k , which are detectable with naco / sdi close to the primary stars .    in section 2 we describe our sdi observations , the obtained astrometry and photometry in detail . with the achieved high contrast sdi imaging we furthermore proof that their is no further companion in the system which could induce the reported long term trend in the radial velocity of gl86a ( queloz et al .",
    "spectra of gl86b were taken with naco and were retrieved from the eso public archive , yielding the surprising result that this companion is a white dwarf companion .",
    "we presented the spectroscopy in section 3 .",
    "finally section 4 summarizes and discusses all results of this letter .",
    "detection of faint objects close to a much brighter source is the main challenge in the direct imaging search for substellar companions ( brown dwarfs or planets ) of stars . within 1arcsec of the bright central source the field",
    "is filled with speckles which are residuals from the none perfect adaptive optics correction of the incoming disturbed wavefront . the achievable signal to noise in this speckle - noise limited region",
    "does not increases with integration time , hence only a subtraction of the speckle pattern can improve the detection limit close to a bright source .    at the eso / vlt the simultaneous differential imager ( sdi ) is offered for the ao - system naco ( lenzen et al .",
    "therein a double wollaston prism splits the beam , coming from the ao system , into 4 beams which pass then through three different narrow band filters with central wavelengths 1.575 , 1.600 and 1.625@xmath7 m and a bandwidth of 25 nm bandwidth each .",
    "the resulting speckle pattern of the four images is almost identical .",
    "since cool ( t@xmath61400k ) objects exhibit a strong methane absorption band at 1.62@xmath7 m they appear much fainter in the 1.625@xmath7 m filter than in the 1.575@xmath7 m filter while the bright star and therefore also the speckle pattern has roughly equal brightness in all images . subtracting the 1.625@xmath7 m sdi image from the image taken through the 1.575@xmath7 m sdi filter",
    "will effectively cancel out the speckle pattern of the star while the signal from the cool companion remains ( see e.g. biller et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we observed gl86 on 12 .",
    "jan 2005 with sdi ( see fig.[sdia ] ) . due to the small sdi field of view ( 5x5arcsec , tilted by 45@xmath8 ) , jittering can not be used for background substraction .",
    "however we apply a small jitter with a box width of only 0.2arcsec ( 10 sdi pixel ) to correct for bad pixels . per jitter",
    "cycle 5 object frames are taken , each is the average of 60 exposures of 2s each .",
    "we always adjust the individual integration time so that only the central 9 sdi pixel of the primary point spread function are saturated .",
    "this improves the detection limit for faint companions at larger separations to the primary . at the end of each jitter cycle a sky - frame ( 10arcsec offset from the target in ra and dec ) is taken which is then subtracted from the 5 object frames to cancel out the bright infrared sky background .",
    "the sky - frames are taken in the same way as the the target - frames , i.e. 60 times 2s integrations .",
    "the jitter cycle is repeated 4 times which yields a total on source integration time of 40min . to distinguish between faint companions and any residual speckles we observe each target at the detector position angles 0 and 33@xmath8 , i.e. 2x40min integration time in total .    for infrared data - reduction",
    "we use the eso _ eclipse _ package .",
    "after flatfielding , we extract the four sdi quadrants ( left - top 1.6@xmath7 m , right - top 1.575@xmath7 m , bottom both quadrants 1.625@xmath7 m ) and apply image - registration , shifting , and final averaging on all individual frames . because the radial position of the speckles is proportional to the wavelength all sdi images must be spatially rescaled .",
    "finally the images are aligned , and their flux is adjusted to eliminate any differences in the quantum efficiency .",
    "the 1.575@xmath7 m and the 1.625@xmath7 m images ( top - right and bottom - left quadrant ) follow the same path through the sdi instrument , i.e. they provide very similar speckle pattern and yield the best contrast for methane rich companions .",
    "we therefore subtract these two sdi images .",
    "the difference frame taken at position angle 0@xmath8 is then subtracted from the difference frame taken at position angle 33@xmath8 . to filter out low spatial frequencies",
    "all frames are unsharp masked ( see fig.[sdib ] ) .",
    "the resulting difference frame compared to the image taken at 1.575@xmath7 m is shown in fig.[sdib ] .",
    "the speckle pattern is effectively subtracted and a detection limit of 12.8mag is reached at a separation of 0.5arcsec .    .",
    "gl86b is well detected in our sdi images and is shown as a black square .",
    "[ sdib ]    for astrometrical calibration of the sdi camera we observed the binary hip9487 .",
    "this system is listed in the hipparcos catalogue ( @xmath9=1.876@xmath20.001arcsec and @xmath10=278.500@xmath20.001@xmath8 at epoch 1991.25 ) and accurate astrometry is available for both components . therefore the binary separation and position angle can be computed for the given observing epoch ( 12 jan .",
    "we derive a pixelscale of 17.210@xmath20.087mas per pixel .",
    "the true north is slightly rotated to the east by 0.33@xmath20.24@xmath8 .    due to the large proper and parallactic motion of gl86 ( @xmath11=2092.59@xmath20.56mas / yr ,",

    "2001 ) already proved that gl86a and b form a common proper motion pair , a result which is significantly ( 263@xmath14 in separation and 279@xmath14 in position angle ) confirmed with our sdi observations ( see fig.[astro ] ) .",
    "gl86b is located 1.93@xmath20.01arcsec at a position angle of 104.0@xmath20.3@xmath8 .",
    "fig.[astro ] illustrates the astrometry from els et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and our astrometric results .",
    "the expected change of separation and position angle is calculated assuming that only gl86a is moving and gl86b is an unrelated background star ( see dashed lines in fig.[astro ] ) .    by comparing our astrometry with data from els et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we find a significant change in position angle of @xmath150.5@xmath8 and + 0.196@xmath20.024arcsec in separation for the given epoch difference .",
    "this is a clear evidence for orbital motion .",
    "the expected orbital motion for a companion at a separation of 21au is shown with dotted lines in fig.[astro ] ( 0.090arcsec / yr and 4.2@xmath8/yr , see also section4 ) .    with the j , h and k infrared magnitudes of gl86b given by els et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the hipparcos parallax of gl86a we derive the absolute magnitudes of gl86b : @xmath16=14.5@xmath20.2mag , @xmath17=14.2@xmath20.2mag , @xmath18=13.5@xmath20.2mag .",
    "if we assume that gl86b is a brown dwarf companion these absolute magnitudes are consistent with a spectral type l7 to t5 ( see vrba et al . 2004 ) .",
    "in our sdi images gl86b is comparable bright in all three filter .",
    "we measure flux - ratios @xmath19=1.11@xmath20.04 .",
    "this clearly rules out spectral types later than t3 , because for theses spectral types @xmath20 due to methane absorption .",
    "infrared spectra of gl86b were taken in eso observing program 070.c-0173(a ) ( extracted by us from the public archive )",
    ". 8 spectra ( 120s each ) were taken in spectroscopic mode s27-sk-3 using the 86mas slit , which yields a resolving power @xmath21=1400 .",
    "for background subtraction , 8arcsec nodding was applied along the slit . to avoid that the bright primary is located on or close to the slit ( saturation ) the slit was orientated perpendicular to the position vector of gl86b relative to the primary .",
    "all images are flatfielded ( lamp flats ) and the spectra are extracted , wavelength calibrated ( with argon lines ) and finally averaged , with standard routines in iraf .",
    "the resulting spectrum is flux calibrated with the photometric standard hip020677 ( g2v ) .",
    "figure[mltspectra ] shows the flux calibrated naco spectrum of gl86b , together with spectra of m1 , l5 , and t5 dwarfs from cushing et al .",
    "for the given spectral range the achieved signal to noise is @xmath040 .",
    "neither characteristic molecular nor atomic absorption features are visible and the continuum is clearly different to those of l and t dwarfs .",
    "the spectrum is even steeper than the m1v reference spectrum which points to an effective temperature hotter than 3700k .",
    "however , in the k - band , the gradient of the continuum is only slightly varying for effective temperatures higher than 4000k , so that we can only give a low temperature limit for gl86b .",
    "therefore we conclude that gl86b is a cool white dwarf companion ( see fig.[wdspectra ] ) . due to its high surface gravity ( @xmath227 )",
    "all absorption line are strongly broadened and therefore hardly detectable ( see e.g. br@xmath23 absorption line at 2.17@xmath7 m , in dobbie et al .",
    "we compare the absolute infrared photometry of gl86b with data from bergeron et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who carried out a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of cool white dwarfs , and derive an effective temperature of 5000@xmath2500k .",
    "we confirmed common proper motion of gl86b to its primary and detected its orbital motion .",
    "this is a clear evidence that gl86b is a bound companion of the exoplanet host star with a projected separation of 21au ( 1.93@xmath20.01arcsec ) . with the achieved high contrast sdi detection limit we can rule out any further stellar companions beyond 0.1arcsec up to 2.1arcsec , i.e. 1au to 23au in projected separation .",
    "t dwarf companions ( t@xmath241400k ) can be detected beyond 0.2.arcsecs ( 2au ) and we are sensitive for faint substellar companions down to 35@xmath25 .",
    "the naco spectrum of gl86b is clearly different to the expected spectral type between l5 and t5 derived from infrared photometry .",
    "gl86b is faint but its spectrum implies that it is even hotter than 3700k ( m1 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that gl86b is a cool white dwarf companion .",
    "queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report a long - term trend in the radial - velocity data of gl86a ( 0.5ms@xmath4d@xmath4 ) .",
    "this is a clear hint on a further stellar companion in the gl86 system .",
    "we compute that with a separation of 21au , the mass of gl86b must be 0.55@xmath26 to induces this trend in the radial velocity .",
    "the derived mass is well consistent with a white dwarf companion .",
    "santos et al . ( 2004 ) determined the mass of gl86a to be 0.7@xmath26 , hence the total mass of the system is 1.25@xmath26 and with a binary semi - major axis of 21au , the expected orbital time is 86yr .",
    "this yields an orbital motion of 0.090arcsec / yr and 4.2@xmath8/yr , assuming a circular orbit , which is also consistent with the measured orbital motion ( see fig.[astro ] ) .",
    "if we assume that both components of the binary have the same age , the white dwarf progenitor must be more massive than gl86a ( 0.7@xmath26 ) to be observable today as a white dwarf companion . according to weidemann ( 2000 ) a 0.55@xmath26 white dwarf is the remnant of 1@xmath26 star . with the white dwarf models presented by richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the derived effective temperature of gl86b ( 5000@xmath2500k ) we can approximate a cooling timescale between 3 and 6gyr , i.e. the binary system should be 13 to 16gyrs old . for more massive white dwarf progenitors ( 2 - 4@xmath26 )",
    "the system age ranges between 2 to 8gyr .",
    "gl86b is the first confirmed white dwarf companion to an exoplanet host star .",
    "theoretically , planets may or may not survive the red giant and asymptotic giant branch phases of stellar evolution .",
    "planets which are located outside the red giant s envelope , which reaches about a few hundred solar radii will survive .",
    "closer companions will be either destroyed or migrate inward and become a close companion to the white dwarf remnant . according to burleigh et al .",
    "( 2002 ) it seems likely that distant planets ( a@xmath275au ) survive the late stages of stellar evolution of main - sequence stars with masses in the range between 1 and 8@xmath28 , i.e. all white dwarf progenitors . in particular in the gl86 system",
    "the separation between the white dwarf and the exoplanet ( 21au ) is large enough that it seems very well possible that the planet can survive the post main sequence phase of a f or g dwarf .",
    "furthermore we should mention that gl86 is one of the closest binaries known today to harbor an exoplanet .",
    "only two other systems @xmath23ceph ( a@xmath019au , e@xmath00.36 , see hatzes et al .",
    "2003 ) and hd41004 ( 23au see zucker et al .",
    "2004 ) have comparable separations . in such close binary systems",
    "the dynamical stability of planets is limited to a small region around the planet host star .",
    "according to holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) the critical semi - major axis a@xmath29 for planets around gl86a is only 6.2au assuming a circular binary orbit ( m=0.55@xmath26 and a=21au ) .",
    "due to mass loss during the post main sequence phase of the white dwarf progenitor , the binary separation was even smaller before ( m@xmath30a = const @xmath31 a@xmath32=15.4au ) , i.e. a@xmath29=3.7au .",
    "we calculate critical semi - major axis also for the two other close binaries and get a@xmath29=7.5au for hd41004 and a@xmath29=4.0au for @xmath23ceph .",
    "we should mention that all exoplanets detected in these close binary systems actually reside within the proposed long - time stable regions .",
    "however it would be of particular interest to search for further substellar companions in theses close binaries to verify with observational results the published theoretical constraints of planet stability in binary systems .",
