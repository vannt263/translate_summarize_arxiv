    "the successful start of the rhic spin program marks a new era in spin physics .",
    "very inelastic @xmath1 collisions at high energies open up unequaled possibilities to thoroughly address many interesting questions , most importantly perhaps those concerning the still unknown role of polarized gluons @xcite .",
    "qcd analyses of upcoming high-@xmath0 prompt photon , jet , heavy flavor , inclusive - hadron , and @xmath2 boson production data will greatly deepen and enrich the understanding of the nucleon and of qcd that we had gained previously from polarized deeply - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons off nucleons .",
    "investigations of interactions between polarized leptons and nucleons will , however , continue to play a vital role in spin physics . besides the many observables of dis , _ photoproduction _ processes are particularly interesting . they give access to the parton content of circularly polarized photons , due to the presence of contributions to the cross section where the photon `` resolves '' into its parton content , for instance , by fluctuating into a vector meson of the same quantum numbers , prior to the hard qcd interaction .",
    "such contributions compete with the `` direct '' part , for which the photon simply interacts as an elementary pointlike particle .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that at lower ( fixed - target ) energies , the direct component tends to dominate over the resolved one . only at collider energies",
    "do resolved contributions become important .",
    "extensive studies in the unpolarized case at the hera and lep colliders have firmly established the concept of photonic parton densities @xcite and shown that resolved photon processes contribute a sizable fraction of photoproduction events in certain kinematic regions .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 and @xmath4 data can be universally described by the same set of photonic parton densities marks an important test and success of qcd .",
    "it has not yet been possible to observe resolved contributions for _ polarized _ photons , due to the fact that only fixed - target lepton - nucleon experiments have been performed so far in the polarized case . in this context , an exciting possibility would be to have a polarized lepton - proton _ collider _ such as the planned erhic project at bnl @xcite , which is currently under discussion .",
    "motivated by this prospect , we present in this paper a study for photoproduction of single - inclusive high-@xmath0 hadrons at a future lepton - proton collider with longitudinally polarized beams , and investigate the sensitivity of this reaction to the contribution from resolved photons . we had made first exploratory studies of this , and related , reactions in @xcite .",
    "our present study goes beyond the results of @xcite in that we now consistently include both the direct and the resolved photon processes in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of qcd .",
    "this is crucial for reliable quantitative analyses in the future as theoretical uncertainties are expected to be under much better control beyond the lowest order ( lo ) approximation of qcd . for the resolved contribution , the nlo corrections",
    "to polarized qcd hard - scattering have become available only recently in @xcite . for the polarized direct component , the corresponding cross sections",
    "were already calculated some time ago in @xcite .",
    "we have rederived the expressions and agree with the published results .",
    "in addition to extending our study to nlo , we also tailor our phenomenological results to the erhic situation .    in the next section we sketch the technical framework for the description of polarized photoproduction reactions .",
    "section iii is devoted to numerical studies for the erhic .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "we consider the spin - dependent photoproduction cross section for the reaction @xmath5 , where the hadron @xmath6 is at high transverse momentum @xmath0 , ensuring a large momentum transfer .",
    "we may then write the differential cross section in a factorized form : @xmath7   \\nonumber \\\\[3 mm ] & = & \\frac{2p_t}{s } \\sum_{a , b , c } \\int^1_{1-v+vw }   \\frac{dz}{z^2 } \\int_{vw / z}^{1-(1-v)/z}\\!\\!\\!\\frac{dv}{v(1-v ) }   \\int^1_{vw / vz}\\!\\!\\frac{dw}{w}\\delta f^l_a(x_l,\\mu_f ) \\delta f^p_b(x_p,\\mu_f )   d_c^{h}(z,\\mu_f ' )    \\nonumber \\\\[3 mm ] & \\times &   \\,\\left [   \\frac{d\\delta \\hat{\\sigma}^{(0)}_{ab\\rightarrow cx}(s , v)}{dv }   \\delta ( 1-w ) + \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_r)}{\\pi } \\",

    "the relations between parton - level and hadron - level variables are @xmath35    as we mentioned earlier , it is a main feature of our paper that for the first time we include both the direct and the resolved contributions to the polarized cross section at nlo , as indicated by the first - order corrections @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) .",
    "the actual calculation of these corrections is generally a formidable task . since later on we",
    "will mainly consider spin asymmetries , we also need the corresponding spin - averaged partonic cross sections .",
    "let us go through the various ingredients that we need in a little more detail .",
    "the resolved contribution is technically equivalent to a hadroproduction cross section such as @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath18 may therefore be immediately adopted from our recent calculation @xcite for this case . in that reference",
    ", we also re - derived the ( previously known @xcite ) expressions for the unpolarized case .",
    "there are in total 16 different partonic channels .",
    "the nlo contributions to the direct - photon component have been calculated in @xcite and @xcite for the unpolarized and polarized cases , respectively .",
    "having the techniques available that we used in @xcite , it was a straightforward , though tedious , work to check the old results from the scratch . for the polarized case we fully agree with @xcite , at an analytical level . in the unpolarized case , we were able to identify some minor mistakes ( beyond those noted in @xcite ) in the computer code of @xcite ; apart from those we agree with that calculation as well .",
    "the technical details of the nlo calculation for the direct part may be found in @xcite .",
    "we will not repeat these here , but will only recall an important aspect of photoproduction cross sections beyond the lo : writing the cross section as the sum of the direct and the resolved photon contributions , @xmath37 we emphasize that neither @xmath38 nor @xmath39 are _ individually _ physical , i.e. , experimentally measurable .",
    "this can be easily seen by noticing that the @xmath40 contributions to the direct cross section have singular configurations arising from a collinear splitting of the incoming photon into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "these contributions are absorbed , according to the factorization theorem , into the so - called `` pointlike '' part of the nlo photonic parton densities and thus into the _ resolved _ component .",
    "the subtraction of the singular part is unique only up to finite pieces , and the ensuing ambiguity ( i.e. , the choice of `` factorization scheme '' ) cancels only when the direct and resolved parts are combined .    as an example ,",
    "when using dimensional regularization ( @xmath41 ) , the appropriate `` counter cross section '' that cancels the @xmath42 collinear singularity in the subprocess @xmath43 is schematically given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the polarized born cross section for the reaction @xmath46 in @xmath47 dimensions , and ( @xmath48 denotes the quark charge ) @xmath49\\ , \\left ( \\frac{s}{\\mu_f^2 } \\right)^\\varepsilon + \\delta h_{q\\gamma}(x)\\;\\;. \\label{eq : eq10}\\ ] ] the freedom in the choice of the factorization prescription is reflected by the arbitrary finite piece @xmath50 which may be subtracted alongside the singular @xmath51 contribution .",

    "the photonic wilson coefficient @xmath56 in the nlo expression for @xmath55 is absorbed into the definition of the quark distributions of the photon .",
    "a similar scheme can be set up in the polarized case as well @xcite by subtracting the corresponding polarized coefficient function @xmath57 in the structure function @xmath58 .",
    "the photonic parton densities in the @xmath59 and @xmath54 schemes are then related in the following way @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61\\ ; , \\\\",

    "the @xmath65 are the appropriate lo partonic cross sections . for the resolved cross section",
    "all partonic cross sections remain unaffected by this transformation .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the scheme transformation indeed leaves the physical cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq8 ] ) invariant .",
    "our explicit analytical expressions for the polarized nlo subprocess cross sections for the direct and resolved cases are too lengthy to be given here , but can be found in our computer code which is available upon request .",
    "let us now turn to a first numerical application of our analytical results . instead of presenting a full - fledged phenomenological study of single - inclusive hadron production in polarized @xmath66 collisions , we only focus on the most interesting questions : the importance of the nlo corrections , the dependence on unphysical scales , and the sensitivity to the yet unmeasured parton densities of circularly polarized photons .    for all our calculations we choose a c.m.s",
    "energy of @xmath67 as planned for polarized electron - proton collisions at erhic .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of neutral pions ( @xmath68 ) ; extension to other hadrons would be straightforward .",
    "we will always perform the nlo ( lo ) calculations using nlo ( lo ) parton distribution functions , fragmentation functions , and the two - loop ( one - loop ) expression for @xmath69 .",
    "the value for @xmath69 is taken according to our choice of proton parton distributions , which is cteq5 @xcite for the unpolarized case and grsv @xcite for the polarized one .    in the equivalent photon spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq6 ] ) we use similar parameters as the h1 and zeus experiments at hera .",
    "we employ @xmath70 and take the photon momentum fraction to be within @xmath71 .",
    "the fragmentation functions for neutral pions , @xmath72 , have been determined with some accuracy from analyses of data for pion production in @xmath3 collisions @xcite . even though our knowledge of the @xmath73 certainly still needs improvement",
    ", we assume for this study that the fragmentation functions will be well known by the time experiments at a future polarized lepton - proton collider are carried out . for our analysis",
    "we take the lo and nlo sets of ref .",
    "@xcite which also yield good agreement with recent high-@xmath0 data for @xmath74 at @xmath75 by the phenix collaboration @xcite .",
    "since the parton distributions @xmath76 of circularly polarized photons are completely unmeasured so far , we have to invoke some model for them .",
    "two extreme scenarios were considered in @xcite , with `` maximal '' [ @xmath77 and `` minimal '' [ @xmath78 saturation of the `` positivity constraint '' @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 denotes the scale where the boundary conditions @xcite for the evolution are specified . for the spin - averaged densities @xmath81 the phenomenologically successful grv photon distributions @xcite were used .",
    "we employ these two extreme sets for the @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq7 ] ) , along with appropriate lo @xcite and nlo @xcite boundary conditions and evolution equations . our default choice for the numerical studies will be the `` maximal '' set .",
    "as we already pointed out in previous lo studies @xcite , for single - inclusive measurements rapidity differential cross sections are particularly suited for extracting the resolved contributions and hence the polarized photonic parton distributions .",
    "this can be easily understood by looking at the momentum fractions of the photon and proton distributions as a function of rapidity .",
    "as we count positive rapidity in the proton s forward direction , large @xmath82 are probed at large negative rapidities .",
    "here one expects no difference between the two photon scenarios since the cross section is dominated by the direct photon contribution sitting strictly at @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , in the region @xmath84 the @xmath76 are dominated by the `` pointlike '' part which only depends on the starting scale @xmath80 but not on the details of the hadronic input . on the other hand , for large and positive rapidities small @xmath85 values are probed , and the resolved contribution is expected to dominate more and more .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows our results for the unpolarized and polarized photoproduction cross sections for neutral pions at lo and nlo at @xmath86 as functions of the laboratory - frame pseudorapidity @xmath87 . for the asymmetric erhic kinematics ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) , @xmath87 is related to the c.m.s .",
    "frame rapidity via @xmath90 we have integrated over the transverse momentum @xmath91 of the produced pion .",
    "all scales have been set equal : @xmath92 .",
    "the lower part of the figure displays the so - called `` @xmath93-factor '' @xmath94 one can see that in the unpolarized case the corrections are roughly constant , of size @xmath95 over most of the @xmath87 region considered . in the polarized case , we find generally much smaller corrections , at least for the above choice of scales . only for negative @xmath87 where the cross section changes sign are the corrections large .",
    "an important reason why inclusion of the nlo corrections is generally vital is that they are expected to considerably reduce the dependence of the cross sections on the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "this improvement in scale dependence when going from lo to nlo is a measure of the impact of the nlo corrections , the residual scale dependence at nlo perhaps providing a rough estimate of the relevance of even higher order qcd corrections .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the scale dependence of the spin - dependent cross section at lo and nlo . in each case",
    "the shaded bands indicate the uncertainties from varying the unphysical scales in the range @xmath96 .",
    "the solid lines are for the choice where all scales are set to @xmath0 .",
    "one can see that the scale dependence indeed becomes much smaller at nlo and that the lowest order approximation may capture the main features of the process but will not provide a satisfactory quantitative understanding .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] demonstrates , as discussed in section ii , that the direct and resolved contributions individually depend on the choice of the factorization scheme , but that the physical , i.e. , experimentally accessible , cross section does not . to make this point , we transform the polarized cross sections from the @xmath52 to the @xmath54 scheme as described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq11])-([eq : eq13 ] )",
    ".    a first determination of the parton content of circularly polarized photons could be one of the key physics goals of the spin physics program at a future lepton - proton collider .",

    "the spin asymmetry shows the expected dependence on the choice of the polarized photon densities . in order to be able to judge whether a future measurement can resolve such a difference we also give in figure [ fig : fig5 ] an estimate for the expected statistical errors : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the polarization of the lepton and proton beam , respectively",
    ", @xmath102 denotes the integrated luminosity of the collisions , and @xmath103 is the unpolarized cross section integrated over bins in @xmath87 .",
    "we have used @xmath104 and @xmath105/fb , which are targets for erhic .",
    "it should be noted that an integrated luminosity of @xmath105/fb is expected to be accumulated after only a few weeks of running so that the statistical accuracy may eventually be much better than the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .    to demonstrate that the sensitivity to @xmath76 is not masked by the dependence on the spin - dependent _ proton _ densities , we show in fig .",

    "it is evident that at large positive rapidities the asymmetry is indeed mainly determined by the polarized photon structure . in the region of @xmath107 a measurement of @xmath108 would be also an excellent source of information on the polarized gluon density in the nucleon .",
    "we note that , in any case , by the time erhic is commissioned we expect the spin structure of the nucleon to be known with much better accuracy than at present",
    ".    figure  [ fig : fig6 ] illustrates how different partonic scatterings @xmath109 contribute to the nlo ( @xmath59 ) polarized resolved cross section , versus rapidity .",
    "recall that parton `` @xmath20 '' emerges from the photon and parton `` @xmath31 '' from the proton .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for the `` minimal '' photon scenario and hence not shown here .",
    "in this paper we have presented the first complete nlo calculation for the spin - dependent photoproduction of inclusive high-@xmath0 hadrons , consistently including the direct and resolved photon contributions at nlo .",
    "our results are relevant for future polarized lepton - proton collider projects like erhic , to which we have tailored our numerical results .",
    "the spin asymmetry for this process is a promising tool for a first determination of the spin structure of circularly polarized photons .",
    "we found that the qcd corrections to the polarized cross section are under good control .",
    "the polarized cross section shows a significant reduction of scale dependence when going from lo to nlo .",
    "we finally note that a single process alone , like pion photoproduction , will allow to establish the very existence of a polarized resolved - photon contribution and may perhaps point towards one of the two scenarios discussed above .",
    "it will , however , not be sufficient to fully disentangle the various quark flavor distributions and the gluon density of the polarized photon .",
    "this will require , as for the nucleon ( spin ) structure , a multitude of processes , combined in a global qcd analysis .",
    "of course , at erhic other photoproduction processes , like jets , di - jets , or heavy flavors , will add further valuable information .",
