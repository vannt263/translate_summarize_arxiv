    "the current standard cosmological model is the @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) scenario , which includes two elements whose components have unknown nature : the dark matter and the dark energy .",
    "this simple model fits quite well the observed behavior of our universe @xcite@xcite at least from the matter - dominated epoch , where structures formation starts .",
    "however , the nature of both the dark components is still elusive and it is matter of intense debate , see , e.g. , @xcite for a broad overview .",
    "while part of the literature approaches the study of this topic by keeping the dark sector divided into two separate components , efforts have been put also into unifying the effect of both dark energy and dark matter under the same mechanism , for example through the modified chaplygin gas models ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . along the same lines , in @xcite",
    "a scalar field potential was introduced , dubbed unified dark matter ( udm ) , which is able to act both as dark matter and dark energy and has been a subject of detailed analysis since then @xcite .",
    "+ here we revisit the dynamical aspect of the udm cosmology first addressed in @xcite , where such scalar field was studied in the background of a spatially curved friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime .",
    "the resulting cosmological model was recast as a hamiltonian system of two coupled oscillators and studied as such .",
    "the phase space of the system was unbounded and allowed trajectories to escape to infinity .",
    "moreover , in the case of a positive spatial curvature indications of chaotic behavior were found for some sets of initial conditions .",
    "these indications were based on transient features of the characteristic lyapunov number and of a similar chaotic indicator , so the chaotic behavior was called chaotic scattering instead of chaos . in general ,",
    "when one addresses the issue of whether a dynamical system suffering escapes exhibits chaos or not , lyapunov - like indicators should be used with caution , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper we mainly address the study of the same cosmological model as in @xcite , but we introduce a different parametrization of the dynamical variables .",
    "this new parametrization confine the system `` in a box '' , i.e. in a bounded variable space .",
    "such reparametrization has been widely used in previous works on cosmological dynamical systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and it is especially useful in treating cosmological models with spatial positive curvature , where the possibility of recollapsing universes has to be taken into account . in fact , in such models , the usual definition of _ expansion - normalized variables _ is doomed to present singular behavior in the turning points of the scale factor .",
    "+ such reparametrization allows us to uncover new information regarding the dynamics of the system . on one hand",
    "it allows us to study the specific features of the cosmological model encoded in the critical points . on the other hand it allows us to have a new perspective on the dynamics of the system .",
    "namely , in the box version of the udm model we have sinks , and every orbit will end up in one of these sinks .",
    "thus , by studying the structure of the basins of attraction of these sinks we can tell whether the system is chaotic or not . if a system is chaotic , then the sensitivity on initial condition will be represented by a fractal structure of the basins of attraction , see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "our analysis shows that the basins of attraction have not a fractal structure , so the orbital dynamics of the udm model should not be chaotic .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the current findings and the ones of @xcite could have resulted from the fact that our new parametrization -widely adopted in cosmology - renders the system non - hamiltonian . + the paper is structured as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : thean ] we present and analyze the udm cosmological model ; we first briefly review the hamiltonian formulation and then provide the bounded dynamical system ; the latter is analyzed in detail from both mathematical and cosmological perspectives . in sec .",
    "[ sec : orbital ] we focus on the analysis of some representative orbits of the variable space , providing their interpretation in cosmological terms ; moreover , we address the problem of the lack of chaos in the system by inspecting the basins of attraction of the sinks .",
    "eventually , sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] summarizes of the main results . in this work",
    "the geometric units are employed .",
    "we consider a cosmological model described by the homogeneous and isotropic frw metric @xmath1 \\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the scale factor . open , flat and closed spatial geometries correspond respectively to @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we will be interested in the spatially closed case , which allows for recollapsing cosmological scenarios . as a source in einstein s field equations we consider the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 of a massive scalar field , uniquely described by its energy density and its pressure given respectively by @xmath6 where @xmath7 indicates the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath8 .",
    "hereafter , we assume an effective barotropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath9 for the scalar field .",
    "the potential @xmath10 in @xcite was chosen to have the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real constants . in order for the field to have a real non - negative mass ,",
    "such constants are required to satisfy the conditions @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "as already stated before , this kind of scalar fluid has been considered as a possible candidate for unifying the effect of the whole dark sector .",
    "+ an alternative form of potential @xcite reads @xmath16 in appendix [ appen ] we discuss briefly the case @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 which is a particular case of a potential already introduced in @xcite .    by implementing metric and source , into einstein s field equations and explicating the covariant conservation of energy - momentum ,",
    "the following system is obtained @xmath19 where we employed the hubble expansion parameter @xmath20 .      in @xcite the udm cosmology",
    "was expressed in terms of two coupled oscillators . to achieve that the variables were changed from @xmath21 to @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this transformation results in a hamiltonian function @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[3^{4/3 } k ( y^2-x^2)^{1/3}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 denote the canonical momenta .",
    "the hamiltonian   describes two coupled oscillators , which makes the udm analysis more dynamically intuitive .",
    "however , since @xmath15 , the constant @xmath13 can be negative and one of the oscillators offers hyperbolic solutions ; this implies the presence of trajectories escaping to infinity @xmath27 even if @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , a closed universe implies also possibility of recollapsing models @xmath28 . since in this coupled oscillators formalism",
    "the system suffers from escapes to infinity and recollapses , the phase space is not bounded ( see @xcite for details ) , and this brings along certain difficulties in performing the dynamical study of the udm cosmology @xcite . in the following section we overcome the unboundedness by performing a novel reparametrization .      in constructing a cosmological dynamical system with flat or negative curvature ,",
    "it is usually sufficient to define dimensionless variables by normalizing the relevant dynamical quantities over the expansion @xmath29 .",
    "however , as we are are considering geometries with @xmath4 ( which is consistent with observations @xcite ) , such choice includes recollapsing solutions .",
    "recollapsing can lead to singular behaviors in the turning points of the scale factor where @xmath30 .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by noting that , while @xmath29 alone can vanish during the evolution , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "instead is always positive .",
    "hence , one can define new variables by normalizing over the quantity @xmath31 the dimensionless variables obtained with such choice are the following @xmath32 the definitions and are inspired by the quantities used in the study of cosmological tracking solutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath33 has to be included in order to close the system , but we stress the fact that it does not act as an independent variable . in fact , knowing in principle the dependence of the potential on the field , one could invert eq .   and obtain @xmath34 , which could then be plugged into eq .   to obtain @xmath35 . in the specific case of potential eq .",
    ", one can see that the function @xmath36 is invertible in the whole range of @xmath37 only if @xmath38 ; however , if @xmath39 the inversion can be carried out only piecewise because the function is not monotonic anymore . here , we focus our attention to the range @xmath40 which , apart from including physically relevant situations , allows for a quite general description , as the features of the critical elements of the variable space turn out to be effectively independent of the specific value of @xmath41 . hence , if @xmath40 , the function @xmath36 is monotonic in @xmath37 and bounded .",
    "it is then straightforward to find @xmath37 as function of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath42\\ ,    % \\quad,\\ ] ] as a consequence of the boundedness of @xmath36 , which is defined in the range @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "expression   can be plugged into eq .   in order to express it as a function of @xmath36 , that is @xmath44 + with regard to other variables  - , it is easy to check that they are bounded as well .",
    "first of all , by recasting eq .   in terms of the normalized variables one obtains @xmath45 given that @xmath46 , then @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "finally , the variable @xmath49 is clearly defined in the interval @xmath50 $ ] ; moreover , we notice that this variable is positive / negative iff the universe is expanding / collapsing .",
    "+ in order to build the dynamical system , it will be useful to write both eq .   and the evolution equation of the quantity @xmath51 in terms of the new variables @xmath52 defining the new `` time '' derivative @xmath53 , the autonomous dynamical system is constructed by taking the prime derivative of the normalized variables - .",
    "then , by implementing eq .   and eqs",
    ".  - , the system takes the following form @xmath54 where f is the function of @xmath36 previously defined , which in terms of the parameters of the potential reads @xmath55 by building the system in this way we decouple the evolution of @xmath51 from the rest of the variables and , through the constraint  , we can disregard the evolution of @xmath56 .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath33 are known in cosmology as the _ slow - roll parameters _ , @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively",
    "; this means that an exponential behavior of the scale factor is an expected feature whenever @xmath60",
    ". would be relevant for the primordial inflationary era , as it determines the duration , or @xmath61-folds , of the exponential expansion . ]",
    "the critical points of the system are those values of the variables @xmath63 for which @xmath64 is satisfied .",
    "the stability of critical points is then analyzed by inspecting the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix evaluated at the points themselves .",
    "if the real part of all the eigenvalues is negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) then the critical point is a sink ( resp .",
    "a source ) , while if the sign of the eigenvalues is mixed then the critical point is a saddle ; in the latter case , the stable eigendirections are given by the eigenvectors corresponding to the negative eigenvalues .",
    "for the system  - we list the critical points , their stability and cosmological interpretation in table [ tab1 ] , while their location inside the invariant subsets are shown in figs.[xh_inv]-[xdu_inv ] for the specific choice @xmath65 .",
    "in such plots we specify with dots the locations of sources ( blue ) , sinks ( green ) and saddles ( black ) .",
    "it is worth noting that both the location and the stability of the critical points are independent of the values of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 as long as their ratio @xmath66 , so that the situations portrayed are easily generalizable .",
    "here we discuss in detail the cosmological interpretation of the critical points .",
    "this can be done by calculating the _ deceleration parameter _ @xmath67 and the _ effective eos parameter _",
    "@xmath68 , which are given respectively by @xmath69 eventually , one can calculate the cosmic time - dependent scale factor of the models by integrating eqs .  ,   in the critical points .",
