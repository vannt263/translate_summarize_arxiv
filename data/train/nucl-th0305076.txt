    "the existence of a near - threshold state can induce dramatic consequences , for instance on fusion probabilities @xcite .",
    "a pair of charmed mesons is presumably near the border separating stability from spontaneous dissociation @xcite .",
    "atoms such as @xmath2 were for a long time believed to be unable to merge into a molecule .",
    "recent studies indicates a tiny binding of the order of @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "however , if one replaces one of the @xmath2 by an atom containing the lighter isotope @xmath5 , then the @xmath6 is unbound .",

    "an intriguing question is whether it is easier to bind three or more components than to form a mere two - body bound state .",
    "an answer is provided by the study of halo nuclei , which contain peripheral neutrons .",
    "consider for instance the @xmath8 nucleus .",
    "it is stable against any dissociation , while the lighter @xmath9he spontaneously decays into a neutron and a @xmath10he . in the ( reasonable ) approximation where the structure of the core is neglected",
    ", this means that the @xmath11 three - body system is bound , while neither @xmath12 nor @xmath13 have a discrete spectrum .",
    "this property of 3-body binding without 2-body binding was astutely named _ borromean _",
    "@xcite , after the borromean rings , which are interlaced in a subtle topological way ( see fig .  [ borrofig ] ) such that if any one of them is removed , the two other become unlocked .     borromean rings ]    the adjective _ borromean _ is nowadays broadly accepted in the field of quantum few - body systems .",
    "borromean binding is intimately related to two other fascinating properties of few - body quantum systems .",
    "the efimov effect @xcite indicates that when the two - body energy vanishes ( e.g. , by tuning the strength of the potential ) , a myriad of weakly - bound states show up in the three - body spectrum .",
    "this implies that the three - body ground - state already exists at this point . slightly above the onset of two - body binding ,",
    "the ratio @xmath14 of two - body to three - body binding energies is very small . by rescaling",
    ", one can reach a situation with a finite 2-body energy , and a 3-body energy that becomes infinite when the range of the potential is made shorter and shorter : this is the thomas collapse @xcite .",
    "this review is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ se : hp ] , the hall - post inequalities are briefly recalled .",
    "they are applied in sec .",
    "[ se : borrob ] to constraint the domain of coupling constants leading to borromean binding for bosons interacting through short - range forces .",
    "the difficulties arising in the case of fermions are described in sec .",
    "[ se : hpf ] .",
    "borromean binding with coulomb forces is the subject of sec .",
    "[ se : borroc ] , before the conclusions .",
    "a number of inequalities can be written down for binding energies in quantum mechanics if one splits the hamiltonian into pieces ( each piece being hermitian ) .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath15 in an obvious notation where @xmath16 is the ground - state energy of @xmath17 .",
    "saturation is obtained if @xmath18 , @xmath19 , etc .",
    ", reach their minimum simultaneously .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath20 describes the motion of a particle feeling both a coulomb and an harmonic potential , then @xmath21 , corresponding to an equal share of the kinetic energy .",
    "a slight improvement is obtained by writing @xmath22+\\left[(1-\\alpha)\\vec{p}^2+r^2/2\\right]$ ] , and optimising @xmath23 .",
    "the reasoning can be applied to obtain a lower bound on 3-body energies in terms of 2-body energies .",
    "this has been discovered independently by several authors working on the stability of matter @xcite or baryon spectroscopy in simple quark models @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 be the hamiltonian describing a system of @xmath0 identical particles interacting with pairwise forces , and @xmath25 be its ground state energy . from the identity @xmath26 where @xmath27 does not include particle @xmath28 ,",
    "one derives @xmath29 which can supplement any upper bound provided by a variational method , to frame the exact energy .",
    "the generalisation to unequal masses or different potentials among the pairs is straightforward .",
    "for instance , @xmath30+\\cdots\\ ] ]    numerical investigations show that the lower bound ( [ hp1 ] ) is not very accurate and never reaches saturation .",
    "the relative wave function of particles 1 and 2 is of course modified by the presence of the third particle , and thus the three - body wave function does not describe optimally the ( 1,2 ) subsystem .",
    "however , this is a small effect which even disappears for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the main source of inaccuracy in ( [ hp1 ] ) is that the contribution of the ( 1,2 ) subsystem is replaced by the _",
    "rest _ energy of an isolated ( 1,2 ) pair , although the ( 1,2 ) pair is not at rest in the whole system .    to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "a better decomposition was written down by hall and post @xcite , and rediscovered in ref .",
    "it involves the translation - invariant part @xmath31 @xmath32 of each hamiltonian @xmath33 and reads @xmath34 this leads to the new inequality @xmath35 which is necessarily better than ( [ hp1 ] ) since , @xmath36 for @xmath37 , and for a given potential , the binding energy is a decreasing function of the constituent mass .",
    "this inequality is optimal in the sense that it can be saturated : this occurs for the harmonic oscillator and only in this case .",
    "the inequality ( [ hp2 ] ) also holds for the variational approximation @xmath38 to the binding energy @xmath39 , provided the sets of trial functions @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are consistent . in particular , one gets saturation , @xmath43 if each variational energy is calculated with a single harmonic - oscillator function @xmath44 .",
    "this is a rather frequent pattern that ( with minimal restrictions ) variational solutions share the properties of the exact ones . for the virial theorem",
    "this was underlined by fock and rediscovered by many authors @xcite .",
    "the case of particles with unequal masses has revealed some surprises .",
    "the simple extension ( here for @xmath42 ) of the decomposition ( [ decom-2 ] ) @xmath45= \\alpha_{12}\\left({m_1 \\vec{p}_2-m_2 \\vec{p}_1\\over m_1+m_2}\\right)^2+v_{12 } + \\cdots~,\\ ] ] does not always give saturation for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the remedy was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath42 particles and extended in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath46 : one should introduce more freedom in the decomposition of the hamiltonian and find the optimal choice by suitable adjustment .    for @xmath42 ,",
    "the decomposition is written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the identification gives the irrelevant vector @xmath49 and the inverse masses @xmath50 in terms of the free parameters @xmath51 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath52 is expressed as a sum of 2-body energies .",
    "it depends on these @xmath51 and is maximised by varying these parameters , for each given set of potentials @xmath53 . in the case of the harmonic oscillator with unequal masses and even unequal strength factors ,",
    "saturation is reached , i.e. , the exact energy always coincides with the lower bound .    for @xmath46 , one should go a step further , and write the decomposition as @xmath54 the momentum @xmath55 is constrained by translation invariance , and @xmath56 , to make it conjugate to @xmath57 .",
    "this leaves two free parameters for each pair , which are adjusted to optimise the lower bound",
    ".    refs .",
    "@xcite contain several examples , where the three- or four - body energy is computed and compared to the above lower bounds . for confining potentials ,",
    "one is not too far from the limiting case of the harmonic oscillator for which the inequality is saturated , and the inequalities ( [ hp2 ] ) provide a very good approximation to the exact energy .",
    "the quality of the approximation deteriorates for short - range or coulomb forces .",
    "the hall  post decomposition was used in the previous section to obtain inequalities on energies at given coupling constant @xmath58 .",
    "they can also be used to provide relations between coupling constants at given energy @xmath59 . in particular for @xmath60 , one can derive inequalities on the critical couplings @xmath61 , where @xmath61 is the minimal strength required to achieve @xmath0-body binding . in one- or two - dimensional quantum mechanics ,",
    "any attractive potential supports at least one bound state @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xmath62 if the integral @xmath63 is negative . for @xmath64 dimensions , the problem is more subtle @xcite .",
    "an attractive potential with short range , say @xmath65 , requires a minimal strength @xmath66 to achieve binding of two constituents of unit mass , and @xmath67 for constituents with mass @xmath68 . a classic paper by blatt and jackson @xcite gives estimates of @xmath69 for simple potentials such as yukawa .    in this context",
    ", the phenomenon of borromean binding is expressed by the property that the critical coupling @xmath70 required to bind three bosons is _ smaller _ than @xmath69 .",
    "more generally , @xmath71 .",
    "several questions can be raised : what is the typical range of values for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , etc .",
    "? are there rigorous constraints on these ratios ?",
    "are these constraints saturated for particular potentials ?",
    "what can be said in the limit of large @xmath0 ?",
    "some results are given in refs .",
    "@xcite , which contain references to earlier papers .",
    "in particular , the decomposition ( [ decom-2 ] ) @xmath74 implies that @xmath33 hardly explores the domain of binding with negative expectation values , if all @xmath75 remain positive .",
    "thus @xmath76 for simple monotonic potentials , one gets @xmath77 , well above the rigorous bound @xmath78 . still , there is a remarkable window of about @xmath79 in the coupling constant , where three - body systems are bound without two - body binding .",
    "one also gets @xmath80 , typically , which , when compared to @xmath77 , reveals a window of about @xmath81 for four - body binding without three - body binding .    for bosons ,",
    "the situation is rather simple . if a potential does not succeed in binding a pair of bosons , but is predominantly attractive , that is to say has a negative scattering length , it will bind a sufficiently large number of bosons .    we have seen that hall  post inequalities are saturated for harmonic potentials .",
    "a pure @xmath82 does not give borromean binding , as @xmath83 would confine even for @xmath84 .",
    "but a potential like @xmath85 in the domain of the relevant wave functions , and vanishing at very large distances @xmath86 , would give @xmath87 , i.e. , nearly saturate the bound  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an attractive potential with an external barrier .",
    "more important for physical applications are potentials with an internal repulsive core .",
    "their wave functions significantly depart from those of the harmonic oscillator and the ratio @xmath72 become closer to 1 .",
    "examples are given in @xcite .",
    "in general , an inequality such as ( [ hp2 ] ) , though remaining valid , is of little interest for fermions .",
    "the ground state @xmath88 corresponds to a symmetric orbital wave function , with , for instance , the spins arranged in a singlet state to fulfil the antisymmetry requirement . on the other hand , three or more electrons can never be in a fully - symmetric orbital wave function .",
    "thus the actual @xmath89 , @xmath37 , will be an excited level of the @xmath89 entering the inequality ( [ hp2 ] ) .    a minimal knowledge of the structure of the wave function",
    "is thus needed to write down an useful inequality .",
    "consider for instance three spin 1/2 fermions in a symmetric spin ( or spin  isospin , or spin  isospin  colour ) state .",
    "then the space wave function of the ground state should be a @xmath90 antisymmetric wave function , a prototype being the harmonic oscillator state @xmath91 $ ] in terms of jacobi coordinates @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the two - body subsystems are in an antisymmetric state with orbital momentum @xmath94",
    ". then @xmath95 results from the identity @xmath96 applied in the subspace of antisymmetric wave functions .    for more than @xmath42 fermions , or other spin states of @xmath42 ,",
    "the problem is more complicated but still , some rigorous results can be obtained .",
    "the basis is the decomposition of @xmath0-particle representations of the permutation group in terms of @xmath97 states @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a spin @xmath98 state of three electrons a given pair is half of the time in a singlet state , and half of time in a triplet state .",
    "this means a proper bound on @xmath52 involves , for @xmath88 , and average over the @xmath99 and the @xmath94 ground state . for other cases",
    ", one needs some group theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "this gives nice _ local _ constraints , i.e. , links from @xmath89 to @xmath100 ( see also the improvements proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . but",
    "this approach fails when extrapolated from @xmath88 to the large-@xmath0 limit of @xmath89 .",
    "this means that much progress remains to be made .",
    "checking the constraints with exactly solvable potentials @xcite gives valuable insight into the problem .",
    "note that the question of writing inequalities for fermion energies is rather old .",
    "in the course of the pioneering papers on the stability of matter , a very clever decomposition was written down @xmath101 where the superscript in @xmath102 indicates that particle @xmath28 is omitted .",
    "each @xmath103 is an independent - particle hamiltonian with ground - state energy @xmath104 , in terms of one - particle energies @xmath105 , properly piled up as explained in textbooks of elementary chemistry ( 2 particles in 1s , 6 in 2p , etc . ) , to ensure antisymmetry .",
    "however , the recoil of , e.g. , the @xmath106 subsystem against the first particle is not taken into account . as a consequence , the inequality is never saturated .",
    "significant progress was achieved by basdevant and martin @xcite , who used sophisticated convexity inequalities to derive a bound for power - law potentials , that becomes saturated in the limit of harmonic forces .",
    "borromean binding as described in sec .",
    "[ se : borrob ] seems at first hardly conceivable for a coulomb potential , since changing the strength by an overall factor @xmath58 simply results in a mere rescaling by @xmath107 of all binding energies @xmath89 .",
    "however , if the stability of ions and molecules does not depend on the overall strength of the interaction , it relies on an adequate balance between attraction and repulsion , and , for a given set of charges , on the ratios of the constituent masses which are involved .    consider for instance a set of three masses @xmath108 carrying charges @xmath109 , ( times an overall factor ) .",
    "systems with identical or nearly identical inverse masses @xmath110 and @xmath111 , such as @xmath112 , @xmath113 or @xmath114 , or neighbouring configurations , are stable , while less symmetric systems such as @xmath115 or @xmath116 spontaneously decay into an atom and an isolated charge @xcite .",
    "note that the stable systems with three unit charges are not borromean , since there are always two stable atoms among the subsystems , @xmath117 and @xmath118 in our notation .",
    "this means that one can construct each stable system step by step : two charges form a stable atom , which attracts the third charge .    for @xmath46 unit charges @xmath119 , there are new possibilities .",
    "the most familiar cases are the following :    * unstable configurations , such as @xmath120 , which spontaneously splits into a protonium and a positronium , * stable systems , the simplest being the @xmath121 molecule @xmath122 , whose all three - body subsystems @xmath123 are stable , * less stable systems , such as the positronium hydride @xmath124 , which can be viewed as a stable @xmath125 fixing a positron , or a stable @xmath126 attached to a proton , or , more interestingly , as an unstable @xmath127 stabilised by the addition of a second electron .",
    "more recently , a new category of four unit - charge systems was revealed @xcite .",
    "they are stable , but _ all _ three- body subsystems are unstable .",
    "hence , they are borromean , in the sense that they can not be built by adding the constituents one by one .",
    "an example is @xmath128 , with a proton , a deuteron and their antiparticles .",
    "indeed , a study by mitroy @xcite , who uses varga s stochastic variational method @xcite , indicates that asymmetric ions @xmath129 are stable in the range @xmath130 while other studies , by bressanini et al .",
    "@xcite , who use a diffusion monte - carlo approach , or varga @xcite with a stochastic search of the range coefficients of a gaussian parametrisation , have established that @xmath131 remain stable for @xmath132 then , for @xmath133 , and for neighbouring configurations @xmath134 , the four - body system is stable while none of its three - body subsystems is stable .",
    "in molecular , nuclear , or hadronic physics , there are fragile and subtle quantum states , whose stability relies on the joint efforts of many subsystems , which by themselves do not contain enough attraction to be stable .",
    "it is of course tempting to extend to political or sociological situations : _",
    "lunion fait la force _ , as it is said in a popular french proverb .",
    "i would like to thank my collaborators on the subjects evoked here : jean - louis basdevant , sonia fleck , jrme goy , olivier juillet , avinash khare , ali krikeb , andr martin , kalman varga , steve moszkowski , tai t.  wu , as well as sami zouzou and his colleagues of constantine .",
