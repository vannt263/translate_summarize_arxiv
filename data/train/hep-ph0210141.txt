    "the interpretation and understanding of polarized structure functions seem to be much more difficult than in the case of unpolarized ones . actually , until now it is not clear how the nucleon spin is generated from the spins and orbital momenta of the quarks and gluons . for the present status and perspectives of the nucleon spin physics",

    "the basic requirement was a consistently covariant formulation of the task for the system of fermions , which are not static , being characterized by some momenta distribution in the frame of their center of mass . in the present paper",
