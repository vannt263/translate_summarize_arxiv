    "both solid and liquid results are shown . in the solid ,",
    "si atoms are bounded by the octahedra formed by the o atoms , and each octahedron is then surrounded by 8 mg atoms . hence mg atoms are expected to have a larger vibrational amplitude then that of the other species , and si atoms are expected to have the smallest vibrational amplitude ( fig .",

    "the slopes of the mean square displacements of each species is close to that of each other .",
    "this suggests the self - diffusion rate of each species is almost the same .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the three types of atoms diffuse like a single molecule , which has to be examined carefully .",
    "however , as the diffusion mechanism is beyond the scope of this work , it will be the subject of further studies .",
    "at 3500 k , the density of crystalline mgsio@xmath0 in the perovskite structure is 5% greater than the liquid at 88 gpa , and this density excess is 2.9% at 120 gpa and 5000 k. the transformation to a post - perovskite phase would further enhance this density contrast .",
    "thus , we find that liquid mgsio@xmath0 is always less dense than the corresponding solid under conditions encountered in earth s mantle .",
    "this implies that stability of melts in the deep lower mantle requires in addition compositional differences between melt and solid .",
    "it is well known on the basis of mineral - melt partitioning data for perovskite that fe is preferentially partitioned into the melt .",
    "hence , in addition to the volume of fusion , fe enrichment in the melt must be considered when evaluating the stability of melts in an idealized ( mg , fe)sio@xmath0 lower mantle  @xcite .",
    "the effect of fe on densities in crystalline and liquid ( mg , fe)sio@xmath0 perovskites can be calculated using known thermoelastic parameters  @xcite and assuming the effect of fe on density in the liquid is similar to its effect on the solid . for solid ( mg , fe)sio@xmath0 compositions with mg/(mg+fe ) ratios of 0.90 to 0.95 , the solid - liquid fe partition coefficients required to be in equilibrium with neutrally buoyant melt at 120 gpa and 5000 k range from 0.31 to 0.48 .",
    "these are within the wide range of reported experimental partition coefficients for perovskite compositions at lower mantle pressures ( 0.12 - 0.57 )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the combination of the small , positive volume change of fusion determined here with fe partitioning constraints from experiment suggest that negative or neutrally buoyant melts are plausible in the d `` and ulvz layers at least with respect to perovskite structure solids .",
    "partition coefficients within the experimentally measured range ( 0.2 - 0.34 ) also produce neutrally buoyant melts at 88 gpa and 3500 k. thus , these results suggest that small amounts of neutrally buoyant partial melt in the deep lower mantle could also contribute to the anomalous @xmath2 observed in this region  @xcite .",
    "negative buoyancy under these conditions could instead lead to melt pooling in d '' and the ulvz  @xcite .",
    "better constraints on fe partition coefficients under deep mantle conditions are needed to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "extrapolation of the trend in fig .",
    "[ vol_3500_120 g ] indicates that mgsio@xmath0 liquid and crystal densities will become equal near 180 gpa .",
    "there are few experimental constraints on densities in mgsio@xmath0 liquids under these extreme conditions .",
    "the density change along the hugoniot in mg@xmath17sio@xmath18 upon shock melting at 150 gpa is small and there is a suggestion of enhanced compressibility in the melt  @xcite .",
    "more recent shock experiments on mgsio@xmath0 compositions have suggested that the density of the melt becomes comparable to that of the solid near 120 gpa , and at 170 gpa the melt density exceeds the solid density  @xcite .",
    "however , the shock data near 120 gpa ( which are directly comparable to our simulations ) have uncertainties that allow melt densities to be as much as several percent less than the solid , and thus they are not necessarily inconsistent with the present results .",
    "the viscosities of silicate liquids have been investigated experimentally using a wide variety of techniques at ambient and low pressures  @xcite . however , there are few constraints on the behavior of silica poor and relatively depolymerized melts that are relevant to melting in the deep earth .",
