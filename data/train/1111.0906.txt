    "the detailed study of the recently discovered high critical temperature superconductivity ( htcs ) in the iron - based pnictides and chalcogenides@xcite continues providing important information to understand the still puzzling mechanism that drives this remarkable phenomenon .",
    "experiments indicate that these fe - based materials share many properties with the high @xmath9 cuprates,@xcite such as magnetically ordered parent compounds@xcite and superconducting states stabilized by either electron or hole doping.@xcite however , there are also remarkable differences , such as the fact that the parent compounds , at least for the pnictides , are ( bad ) metals rather than mott insulators",
    ". moreover , several of the iron @xmath10-orbitals are active at the fermi surface ( fs ) as opposed to the case of the cuprates where just the copper @xmath11 orbital plays the major role .",
    "while it has been clearly established that the superconducting pairing operator has @xmath10-wave symmetry in the case of the hole - doped cuprates,@xcite the symmetry of the pairing operator in the pnictides is still controversial : surface - sensitive angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) studies  @xcite indicate that full nearly - momentum - independent gaps open on all fs pockets , compatible with the @xmath12 state .",
    "@xcite however , several other experiments testing bulk properties provide results compatible with nodal superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    reliable theoretical studies are difficult to implement for the complex multi - orbital models needed for these materials without making explicit assumptions about the ground state properties or about the mechanism and strength of the pairing interactions . under the assumption of a magnetically driven superconducting instability , the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "is often applied in this context providing indications that several pairing channels , mostly @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are in competition in this type of compounds.@xcite however , rpa relies on a particular subset of feynman diagrams and it is a weak - coupling approach . on the opposite extreme , strong coupling studies have also been performed . depending on the particular model used , some authors have found evidence of pairing with @xmath5 symmetry @xcite while others have found a variety of competing states.@xcite a complementary approach to these previous investigations is to perform an exact diagonalization ( ed ) of the model hamiltonians , allowing to solve the problem exactly for any value of the interaction .",
    "however , since the hilbert space grows exponentially with the system size , this method can be implemented only in very small clusters and with a reduced number of active fe orbitals .",
    "this ed approach has been recently applied by the authors and collaborators to the study of an electron - doped two - orbital hubbard model and in that effort the presence of competing pairing states was observed as the strength of the coupling parameters was varied.@xcite    an important characteristic of the widely studied hubbard models for the pnictides / chalcogenides is that they are not particle - hole symmetric . on the experimental side ,",
    "superconductivity has been found both upon electron and hole doping , but it seems that hole - doped materials belonging to the 122 family are more suitable for the use of surface - sensitive techniques , while electron - doped materials belonging to the 1111 family are more easily studied with bulk techniques.@xcite then , it is natural to wonder whether a potential source of the differences in the experimental results regarding the pairing symmetries may arise from the nature of the dopants . for this reason it is important to study theoretically the properties of multi - orbital hubbard models both under electron and hole doping .",
    "previously , such a comparative analysis has been performed employing the rpa method applied to a five - orbital hubbard model.@xcite for the parameter range studied in that case ( weak coupling ) , a pairing state with @xmath3 symmetry was observed in both cases .",
    "the state found has nodes on the electron pockets in the electron - doped case , but upon hole - doping an extra hole pocket at the @xmath13 point in the brillouin zone leads to the removal of the nodes and the development of a nodeless @xmath12 state.@xcite    the goal of the present publication is to study the most favorable pairing channels of a two - orbital hubbard model using small - cluster exact diagonalization techniques ( namely , the lanczos algorithm ) for the case of hole doping , and to contrast the results against those found for the case of electron - doping of the same model that have been recently reported.@xcite to reduce the severe constraints imposed by the small size of the clusters that can be diagonalized in present day computers , a simple generalization of the hubbard model for the pnictides , previously introduced for the study of the electron doped case,@xcite will be here applied .",
    "for this purpose , heisenberg `` @xmath2 '' terms will be added to the original hubbard model to enhance spin order and pairing tendencies , but without projecting out doubly occupied sites and charge fluctuations .",
    "these terms help to establish tightly bound - states upon doping that can be studied with lanczos methods on the small clusters currently accessible with state - of - the - art computers .",
    "comparisons with rpa results for the five - orbital model and with experimental data will be performed .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the model and the method are reviewed in section  [ sec : model ] , the main results for hole doping are presented in section  [ results ] , while section  [ conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the model studied here is based on the well - known and widely used two - orbital hubbard model  @xcite that employs the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) fe orbitals .",
    "these orbitals provide the largest contribution to the pnictides band structure at the fs .",
    "@xcite the reduction in the actual number of active orbitals in the pnictides is necessary in order to perform the present lanczos studies .",
    "calculations with more orbitals for the same cluster studied here are simply not possible at present .",
    "the parameters of the electronic hopping terms of the model were previously chosen to provide a close agreement with the band structure calculations obtained with density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite in addition to the hopping terms , the model also includes the on - site coulomb interaction consisting of intra- and inter - orbital coulomb repulsions with couplings @xmath1 and @xmath18 , the hund s rule coupling @xmath19 , and the pair - hopping term with strength @xmath20 .",
    "while @xmath1 can in principle depend on the particular orbital due to different screening effects for each orbital , this is not the case for the @xmath14 and @xmath16 orbitals that form a degenerate @xmath21 doublet , implying that the relations @xmath18=@xmath22 , and @xmath20=@xmath19 are fulfilled for symmetry reasons .",
    "@xcite this hamiltonian , with the kinetic - energy hopping and onsite - interaction terms above mentioned , has been studied in detail previously .",
    "@xcite moreover , in a recent investigation of the electron - doped case ,  @xcite the model was supplemented by a heisenberg interactions to amplify the strength of the magnetic state and , consequently , the pairing strength as well .",
    "naively , it may seem that selecting a stronger on - site hubbard interaction would stabilize a stronger antiferromagnetic state .",
    "however , this procedure also induces an insulator , and actually the strength of the effective coupling between the fe - spins decreases as @xmath23 with increasing @xmath1 . to avoid this problem , in early studies of the one - band @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model  @xcite and in a recent study of the electron - doped two - orbital model ,  @xcite heisenberg terms",
    "have been added and shown to enhance pairing tendencies .",
    "since our aim is to investigate the symmetries of the cooper pairs , the additional magnetic interactions must have the same symmetries as the original hamiltonian . to make sure that the symmetries are properly handled , the additional heisenberg interaction is given by the operatorial form that corresponds to the superexchange terms derived from the strong - coupling ( large-@xmath1 ) limit . in the case of the one - band hubbard model ,",
    "this is a heisenberg term with spin @xmath24 . in the case of a multi - orbital model away from half - filling",
    ", the corresponding superexchange contains an orbital degree of freedom in addition to the spin and it is of a kugel - khomskii type .",
    "@xcite    in the present case of a half - filled two - orbital model , the low - energy hilbert space for the strong - coupling limit , with both @xmath1 and @xmath19 large , is given by doubly occupied sites with singly occupied orbitals .",
    "due to the hund s coupling , the two electrons per site form a triplet state , with an energy @xmath25 , compared to @xmath26 and @xmath27 for inter- and intra - orbital singlet states .",
    "the low - energy hilbert space is , thus , given by a spin @xmath28 at each site .",
    "the interaction between these spins can be obtained by second - order perturbation theory in an analogous manner as the well - known derivation of the heisenberg model from the one - orbital hubbard model .",
    "the calculation for the two orbitals is the most easily carried out when the hopping term preserves orbital flavor , because the first hopping process , which creates a virtual excitation with energy @xmath29 , then has to involve the same orbital as the second , which goes back to the low - energy hilbert subspace . by this procedure",
    "it can be shown that the result is the isotropic heisenberg interaction for @xmath28 with a coupling @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the hopping parameters corresponding to the two orbitals . with the notation @xmath33 ,  @xcite",
    "the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) coupling @xmath34 can be derived . for a next - nearest  neighbor ( nnn ) coupling , which is natural since in the original hubbard model the hoppings involve both nn and nnn fe atoms , it is convenient to transform to a rotated orbital basis @xmath35 , where the hoppings are diagonal in orbital space and given by @xmath36 , leading to @xmath37 similarly as in the previous investigation of ref .   and to avoid the proliferation of parameters ,",
    "the ratio @xmath38 is kept fixed to 0.93 , which is the value that results from @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41.@xcite for the electron - doped case , the results were found to be not sensitive to changes in this ratio as long as the model remains in the regime with @xmath42/@xmath43 magnetic order.@xcite    the extended two - orbital hubbard hamiltonian is exactly investigated using the lanczos algorithm@xcite on a tilted @xmath44 cluster , as done in previous studies .",
    "@xcite in spite of the small size of the cluster , this still requires substantial computational resources . more specifically , even exploiting the hamiltonian symmetries the calculation of the undoped - limit ground state of",
    "the eight - sites cluster still requires a basis with @xmath45 - 20 m states ( slightly more demanding than a 16-site cluster one - band hubbard model ) , depending on the subspace explored . runs applying",
    "the lanczos technique had to be performed for all the allowed momenta @xmath46 of the cluster , and for all the quantum numbers under rotations and reflections ( i.e. all the irreducible representations @xmath3 , @xmath47 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath48 of the @xmath49 symmetry group  @xcite ) , and also for all the @xmath50-axis total spin projections .",
    "in addition , the computation of binding energies for the case of hole doping requires calculations for a number of electrons @xmath51 equal to 14 , 15 , and 16 , varying @xmath1 , @xmath19 , and @xmath34 using a fine grid . for these reasons ,",
    "the overall effort amounted to @xmath52 diagonalizations of the cluster , supplemented also by calculations of dynamical properties , using a penguin 128 gb altus 3600 computer .",
    "it is important to remind the readers that the most commonly used models for the pnictides are usually defined in the so - called unfolded brillouin zone.@xcite due to the symmetry of the fe - as planes,@xcite it is possible to describe the pnictides using fe - only effective models where the as atoms merely provide a bridge for the electronic hopping between the irons . under this approximation",
    "only one fe atom is left per unit cell to describe these materials.@xcite as a result of these considerations , the number of orbitals to be considered is reduced by half , which is a computational advantage , and the size of the brillouin zone ( bz ) is doubled . for this reason , the momentum in the unfolded zone is dubbed `` pseudocrystal '' momentum.@xcite in order to relate the model results to experiments addressing the bz corresponding to two fe atoms , it is necessary to `` fold '' the extended bz in such a way that the pseudocrystal momentum @xmath6 is folded onto momentum @xmath53 . the physical difference between states with @xmath7 and @xmath54",
    "is that the first indicates a bonding and the second an antibonding combination of the @xmath10-orbitals in the two fe atoms in the two - atoms unit cell . in the presentation of our results below",
    ", @xmath46 will stand for pseudocrystal momentum .      the relative symmetry between the undoped ( @xmath55 ) ground state ( gs ) and the @xmath56 gs has been studied with the lanczos technique varying @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the undoped gs was found to have momentum @xmath7 and it transforms according to the @xmath3 representation of the @xmath49 group , for all the values of @xmath19 and @xmath1 studied here , in agreement with previous results .",
    "@xcite however , a surprising result found in the present study of the hole - doped extended two - orbital model is the presence of many competing low - energy states not only with different symmetries as in the electron doped case,@xcite but also with different pseudocrystal momenta @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , low lying states with both @xmath7 and @xmath54 were found in our lanczos investigation .",

    "in addition , the susceptibilities indicate that while nn pairs are favored in the electron doped case , nnn have larger susceptibilities upon hole doping for @xmath3 and @xmath5 symmetries .",
    "the properties of a recently introduced two - orbital extended hubbard model for the pnictides have been studied upon hole doping with the help of the lanczos method .",
    "the results were contrasted with the previously studied electron - doped case.@xcite due to the lack of particle - hole symmetry in the hamiltonian , the results , as expected , are quantitatively different in both cases . however , an additional surprising characteristic of the hole - doped ground state is that it has pseudocrystal momentum @xmath54 . in the reduced brillouin zone representation corresponding to the physical two fe - atoms per unit cell description of the pnictides , having a nonzero pseudocrystal momentum means that the ground state is characterized by antibonding rather than bonding combinations of the orbitals of the two fe atoms in the unit cell . in terms of the pairing operators that are favored ,",
    "it means that the pairs would arise from hole carriers located at the hole pockets at @xmath128 and at @xmath8 in the unfolded brillouin zone .",
    "interestingly , the five - orbital model for the pnictides@xcite shows that upon hole doping a hole pocket , absent in the electron - doped case , develops around @xmath8 and the role of this pocket plays an important role in the properties of the hole - doped materials.@xcite our results may indicate that a simple toy model , such as the two - orbital model , could be used to study the role that a hole - pocket at @xmath8 plays when multiorbital hubbard models are hole - doped .    in spite of this difference in the pseudocrystal momentum quantum number ,",
    "there are several commonalities between the hole- and electron - doped two - orbital hubbard models .",
    "the most important feature is that there are several low - lying states with different symmetries close to the undoped ground state .",
    "for this reason , the symmetry of the doped states is strongly dependent on the actual values of the interaction parameters .",
    "spin - singlet states that transform according to the irreducible representations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 were obtained both for hole and for electron doping .",
    "the richness of the phase diagrams unveiled here , and in the cited previous investigations , suggests that the symmetry of the pairing state in the pnictides is likely to depend on the material as well as on the type of doped carriers ( electrons or holes ) and on the density of dopants .",
