    "on - line social networks ( osns ) such as facebook , myspace , twitter , and flickr have become increasingly popular in recent years . in osns",
    ", nodes represent people on - line , and edges correspond to a friendship relation between them . in these complex real - world networks with sometimes millions of nodes and edges , new nodes and edges dynamically appear over time .",
    "parallel with their popularity among the general public is an increasing interest in the mathematical and general scientific community on the properties of on - line social networks , in both gathering data and statistics about the networks , and finding models simulating their evolution .",
    "data about social interactions in on - line networks is more readily accessible and measurable than in off - line social networks , which suggests a need for rigorous models capturing their evolutionary properties .",
    "the small world property of social networks , introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite , is a central notion in the study of complex networks , and has roots in the work of milgram @xcite on short paths of friends connecting strangers .",
    "the small world property posits low average distance ( or diameter ) and high clustering , and has been observed in a wide variety of complex networks .",
    "an increasing number of studies have focused on the small world and other complex network properties in osns .",
    "adamic et al .",
    "@xcite provided an early study of an on - line social network at stanford university , and found that the network has the small world property .",
    "correlation between friendship and geographic location was found by liben - nowell et al .  @xcite using data from livejournal .",
    "kumar et al .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the on - line networks flickr and yahoo!360 .",
    "they found ( among other things ) that the average distance between users actually decreases over time , and that these networks exhibit power - law degree distributions .",
    "golder et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the facebook network by studying the messaging pattern between friends with a sample of 4.2 million users .",
    "they also found a power law degree distribution and the small world property .",
    "similar results were found in @xcite which studied cyworld , myspace , and orkut , and in @xcite which examined data collected from four on - line social networks : flickr , youtube , livejournal , and orkut .",
    "power laws for both the in- and out - degree distributions , low diameter , and high clustering coefficient were reported in the twitter friendship graph by java et al .  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", geographic growth patterns and distinct classes of users were investigated in twitter . for further background on complex networks and their models ,",
    "see the books @xcite .",
    "recent work by leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite underscores the importance of two additional properties of complex networks above and beyond more traditionally studied phenomena such as the small world property .",
    "a graph @xmath3with @xmath4 edges and @xmath5 nodes satisfies a _ densification power law _",
    "if there is a constant @xmath6 such that @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath7 in particular , the average degree grows to infinity with the order of the network ( in contrast to say the preferential attachment model , which generates graphs with constant average degree ) . in @xcite ,",
    "densification power laws were reported in several real - world networks such as a physics citation graph and the internet graph at the level of autonomous systems .",
    "another striking property found in such networks ( and also in on - line social networks ; see @xcite ) is that distances in the networks ( measured by either diameter or average distance ) decreases with time . the usual models such as preferential attachment or copying models have logarithmically or sublogarithmically growing diameters and average distances with time .",
    "various models ( such as the forest fire @xcite and kronecker multiplication @xcite models ) were proposed simulating power law degree distribution , densification power laws , and decreasing distances .",
    "we present a new model , called _ iterated local transitivity _ ( ilt ) , for osns and other complex networks which dynamically simulates many of their properties .",
    "the present article is the full version of the proceedings paper @xcite .",
    "although modelling has been done extensively for other complex networks such as the web graph ( see @xcite ) , models of osns have only recently been introduced ( such as those in @xcite ) .",
    "the central idea behind the ilt model is what sociologists call _ transitivity _ : if @xmath8 is a friend of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a friend of @xmath11 then @xmath8 is a friend of @xmath12 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in its simplest form ,",
    "transitivity gives rise to the notion of _ cloning _ , where @xmath8 is joined to all of the neighbours of @xmath9 . in the ilt model , given some initial graph as a starting point , nodes are repeatedly added over time which clone _ each _ node , so that the new nodes form an independent set .",
    "the ilt model not only incorporates transitivity , but uses only local knowledge in its evolution , in that a new node only joins to neighbours of an existing node .",
    "local knowledge is an important feature of social and complex networks , where nodes have only limited influence on the network topology .",
    "we stress that our approach is mathematical rather than empirical ; indeed , the ilt model ( apart from its potential use by computer and social scientists as a simplified model for osns ) should be of theoretical interest in its own right",
    ".    variants of cloning were considered earlier in duplication models for protein - protein interactions @xcite , and in copying models for the web graph @xcite .",
    "there are several differences between the duplication and copying models and the ilt model .",
    "for one , duplication models are difficult to analyze due to their rich dependence structure .",
    "while the ilt model displays a dependency structure , determinism makes it more amenable to analysis .",
    "the ilt model may be viewed as simplified snapshot of the duplication model , where _ all _ nodes are cloned in a given time - step , rather than duplicating nodes one - by - one over time .",
    "cloning all nodes at each time - step as in the ilt model leads to densification and high clustering , along with bad expansion properties ( as we describe in subsection  [ results ] ) .",
    "we finish the introduction with some asymptotic notation .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be functions whose domain is some fixed subset of @xmath15 .",
    "we write @xmath16 if @xmath17exists and is finite .",
    "we will abuse notation and write @xmath18 .",
    "we write @xmath19 if @xmath20 , and @xmath21 if @xmath18 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 then @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) .",
    "so if @xmath26 then @xmath13 tends to @xmath27      we now give a precise formulation of the model .",
    "the ilt model generates finite , simple , undirected graphs @xmath28 _ time - step _",
    "@xmath29 , for @xmath30 , is defined to be the transition between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( note that a directed graph model will be considered in the sequel .",
    "see also section  3 . )",
    "the only parameter of the model is the initial graph @xmath33 which is any fixed finite _ connected _ graph .",
    "assume that for a fixed @xmath34 the graph @xmath35 has been constructed .",
    "to form @xmath36 for each node @xmath37 add its _ clone _ @xmath38 such that @xmath39 is joined to @xmath0 and all of its neighbours at time @xmath40 note that the set of new nodes at time @xmath41 form an independent set of cardinality @xmath42 see figure  1 for the graphs generated from the @xmath43-cycle over the time - steps @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we write @xmath48 for the degree of a node at time @xmath49 @xmath5 for the order of @xmath50 and @xmath4 for its number of edges .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath51 . given a node @xmath0 at time @xmath49 let @xmath39 be its clone .",
    "the elementary but important recurrences governing the degrees of nodes are given as    @xmath52      we state our main results on the ilt model , with proofs deferred to the next section .",
    "we give rigorous proofs that the ilt model generates graphs satisfying a densification power law and in many cases decreasing average distance ( properties shared by the forest fire @xcite and kronecker multiplication @xcite models ) .",
    "a randomized version of the ilt model is introduced with tuneable densification power law exponent .",
    "properties of the ilt model not shown in the models of @xcite are higher clustering than in random graphs with the same average degree , and smaller spectral gaps for both their normalized laplacian and adjacency matrices than in random graphs .",
    "further , the cop and domination numbers are shown to remain the same as the graph from the initial graph @xmath2 , and the automorphism group of @xmath2 is a subgroup of the automorphism group of graphs generated at all later times .",
    "the ilt model does not , however ( unlike the models of @xcite ) generate graphs with a power law degree distribution .",
    "the number of nodes in the ilt model grows exponentially with time ( as in the kronecker multiplication model , but unlike in the forest fire model ) .",
    "we first demonstrate that the model exhibits a densification power law .",
    "define the _ volume _ of @xmath35 by @xmath53    [ adeg]for @xmath54 the average degree of @xmath55 equals @xmath56    note that theorem  [ adeg ] supplies a densification power law with exponent @xmath57 we think that the densification power law makes the ilt model realistic , especially in light of real - world data mined from complex networks ( see @xcite ) .",

    "note that the ultimate average distance is a new graph parameter .",
    "we provide an exact value for @xmath62 and compute the ultimate average distance for any initial graph @xmath63    [ adist ] @xmath64 +    1 .   for @xmath54 @xmath65 2 .   for @xmath54 @xmath66 3 .   for all graphs @xmath33 @xmath67",

    "further , the condition in ( 3 ) for @xmath72 holds for large cycles and paths .",
    "hence , for many initial graphs @xmath33 the average distance decreases , a property observed in osns and other complex networks ( see @xcite ) .",

    "social networks often organize into separate clusters in which the intra - cluster links are significantly higher than the number of inter - cluster links .",
    "in particular , social networks contain communities ( characteristic of social organization ) , where tightly knit groups correspond to the clusters @xcite . as a result ,",
    "social networks possess bad expansion properties realized by small gaps between their first and second eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "we find that the ilt model has bad expansion properties as indicated by the spectral gap of both its normalized laplacian and adjacency matrices .    for regular graphs ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix are related to several important graph properties , such as in the expander mixing lemma .",
