    "a function @xmath7 is said to be hyperbolically completely monotone ( hcm ) if for every @xmath8 , the function @xmath9 is completely monotone ( cm ) as a function of the variable @xmath10 .",
    "this class coincides with that of functions of the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 or pointwise limits thereof .",
    "a positive random variable @xmath14 is called hcm if it has a density which is @xmath15 .",
    "the hcm class is closed with respect to multiplication and division of independent random variables .",
    "moreover , if @xmath14 is @xmath15 then @xmath16 is @xmath15 for every @xmath17 .",
    "this class was introduced by o. thorin and l. bondesson and is closely connected to the class of generalized gamma convolutions ( ggc ) .",
    "we say that the distribution of a positive random variable @xmath14 is a @xmath18 if its laplace transform reads @xmath19 for some @xmath20 called the drift coefficient and some positive measure @xmath21 called the thorin measure , which is such that @xmath22 the ggc class is a subclass of the positive self - decomposable ( sd ) distributions , and in particular all ggc distributions are infinitely divisible ( i d ) . in @xcite bondesson proved the inclusion @xmath23 , which allows to show the ggc property and hence the infinite divisibility of many positive distributions whose laplace transforms are not explicit enough . as a genuine example , in @xcite o. thorin proves the infinite divisibility of powers of a gamma random variable at order @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "this is also an easy consequence to the fact that gamma densities are @xmath15 .",
    "in fact thorin uses the hcm - idea in a primitive form in his paper .",
    "another link between the two above classes is that a random variable @xmath14 is ggc if and only if its laplace transform is @xmath15 .",
    "this characterization , which is also due to bondesson , can be used to show both ggc and hcm properties , and it will play some role in the proof of the main result of this paper .",
    "we refer to the monograph @xcite for an account on these topics , including the proof of all above properties .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive @xmath26-stable random variable , @xmath27 , normalized such that its laplace transform reads @xmath28 observe that this laplace tranform is of the form ( [ ggc ] ) , so that all positive @xmath26-stable distributions are ggc . in this paper",

    "last , a positive answer to the if part for @xmath41\\cup [ 1/3,1/2]$ ] has been recently announced in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the random variable @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "it is well - known ( see @xcite or exercise 4.21 in @xcite ) that @xmath3 has an explicit density which is that of a drifted cauchy random variable conditioned to be positive , viz .",
    "it is given by @xmath44 when @xmath45 , the above random variable is the half - cauchy , whose infinite divisibility has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "this result has been refined into self - decomposability in @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is shown in @xcite that @xmath3 has never a ggc distribution , and in particular does not have an hcm density .",
    "our main result shows that this property holds when taking sufficiently high power transformations .    the power transformation @xmath4 has a @xmath15 density if and only if @xmath5 and @xmath46 .",
    "whereas the only if part of this theorem is a direct consequence of known analytical properties of hcm functions , the if part is more involved and relies on laplace inversion and a pick function characterization .",
    "this result shows that the explicit density of @xmath4 is the pointwise limit of functions of the type ( [ prodhcm ] ) as soon as @xmath5 and @xmath47 but we could not find any constructive argument for that .",
    "the main interest of our theorem is to propose a refined version of bondesson s conjecture , from the point of view of power transformations .",
    "it is indeed natural to raise the further    the density of @xmath48 is @xmath15 if and only if @xmath5 and @xmath49    observe that our result shows already the only if part . some partial results for the if part are also given in @xcite where it is shown that @xmath48 is sd when @xmath5 and @xmath50  see proposition 1 in @xcite , and the whole section 3 therein where the critical power exponent @xmath51 appears naturally . in general , this conjecture on the power transformations of @xmath0 seems hard to solve , even when @xmath26 is the reciprocal of an integer .",
    "in this paper we briefly handle the explicit case @xmath45 which is immediate , and the case @xmath52 which relies on a certain product formula for the modified bessel function .",
    "this formula leads to another conjecture on the independent product of two gamma random variables .",
