    "the golden code was proposed in @xcite as a full rate and full diversity code for @xmath0 multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems with _ non - vanishing minimum determinant _ ( nvd ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite how this property guarantees to achieve the diversity - multiplexing gain trade - off . in order to enhance the coding gain , a first attempt to concatenate the golden code with an outer trellis code",
    "was made in @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting _ ad hoc _ scheme suffered from a high trellis complexity .    in @xcite , a golden space - time trellis coded modulation ( gst - tcm )",
    "scheme was designed for slow fading channels .",
    "the nvd property of the inner golden code is essential for a tcm scheme .",
    "this property guarantees that the code will not suffer from a reduction of the minimum determinant , when a constellation expansion is required @xcite . the systematic design proposed in @xcite ,",

    ", we analyze performance of the gst - tcm scheme in _ block fading _ channels @xcite .",
    "the block fading channel is a simple and powerful model to describe a variety of wireless fading channels ranging from fast to slow .",
    "for example , in ofdm based systems over frequency selective fading channels it can model various channel delay profiles . in particular , low delay spread channels correspond to small frequency selectivity , i.e. , many adjacent subcarriers experience similar fading coefficients . on the contrary ,",
    "channels with long delays profiles correspond to large frequency selectivity , i.e. , the fading coefficients vary significantly among adjacent subcarriers .    in practice , it is not useful to design a gst - tcm for specific block fading channel parameters and a robust solution is preferable .",
    "we therefore analyze the performance of known gst - tcm , designed for slow fading , over arbitrary block fading channels .",
    "the impact of the block fading channel on the code performance is estimated analytically using a two - term truncated union bound ( ub ) .",

    "the ub gives an upper bound to the performance of the stbc , while a truncated ub gives an asymptotic approximation @xcite .",
    "the dominant term in the ub is the pep that depends on the _ minimum determinant _ of the codeword distance matrix @xmath56 where the superscript @xmath57 denotes the slow fading case .",
    "the traditional code design criterion for space - time codes in @xcite is based on the minimization of the dominant term in the ub , which in turn depends on the _ diversity gain _ @xmath58 and the _ coding gain _",
    "@xmath59 .    in this letter",
    ", we will consider the truncated ub with two terms @xmath60 where the @xmath61 are the two largest peps of the two dominating events depending on and @xmath62 the corresponding multiplicities .",

    "the above performance metric @xmath74 could hard to exploit , due to the non - additive nature of the determinant metric in ( [ determinant ] ) .",
    "since @xmath75 are positive definite matrices , we resort to the following determinant inequality @xcite @xmath76 and use the simpler lower bound : @xmath77 we can see that the @xmath78 is not only determined by the code structure , but also by the block fading channel parameters @xmath79 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath80 coincides with the @xmath81 defined in @xcite , when @xmath45 ( slow fading ) .",

    "in this section we show the specific analysis concerning gst - tcm @xcite .",
    "the design of gst - tcm for slow fading ( @xmath45 ) was based on :    * the design of a trellis code that maximizes the number of non - zero @xmath82 in ( [ detfl ] ) * the design of partitions of the golden code with increasing values of @xmath82    in particular , the trellis design focused on the _ shortest simple error event _ , i.e. , a path diverging from the zero state and remerging into the zero state in the trellis diagram .",
    "we will show here how the length @xmath83 of such event influences the performance of the code over a block fading channel .",
    "a gst - tcm of length @xmath84 can have @xmath85 shortest simple error events . @xmath86    * proof *  the shortest simple error events with length @xmath83 can only start in a position @xmath87 , thereby we obtain @xmath88.@xmath86    since the codeword spans @xmath89 independent fading blocks of length @xmath40 , the simple error events will affect different blocks depending on their starting position and length .",

    "if @xmath95 then it will either cross @xmath90 or @xmath96 concecutive blocks .",
    "for example , if @xmath97 over a block fading channel where @xmath98 and @xmath99 , as shown in fig .",

    "now , let us define a _ group _ as @xmath106 consecutive blocks . hence",
    ", a group has length @xmath107 and contains @xmath108 distinct shortest simple error events .",
    "since there are @xmath109 distict groups , we have @xmath110 shortest simple error events of case 1 .",
    "the other case directly derives from the identity @xmath111 . @xmath86    using the same example illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : enumsee ] with @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , it is shown that we have @xmath112 simple error events crossing @xmath113 consecutive block ( case 1 ) and @xmath114 simple error events crossing @xmath115 consecutive blocks ( case 2 ) .    in order to evaluate the two dominant terms in ( [ eq : truncub ] ) we look at the contribution of the simple error events in the trellis together with their multiplicity .",
    "we get @xmath116 terms with the corresponding minimum determinant @xmath117 and @xmath118 terms with the corresponding minimum determinant @xmath119 depending on the length and structure of the simple error events , the @xmath120 and @xmath121 , together with their multiplicity @xmath122 , will dominate the performance of the coding scheme .",
    "even if we have @xmath121 smaller than @xmath120 its contribution to the overall performance can be mitigated by the fact that @xmath123 .",
    "we will see in the following section how the @xmath124s are affected by the trellis code structure .",
    "in this section we show the performance of different gst - tcm schemes over block fading channels .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio per bit is defined as @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the energy per bit and @xmath127 denotes the number of information bits per qam symbol of energy @xmath128 .",
    "we consider two types of gst - tcm based on the two and three level partitions @xmath129 and @xmath130 in @xcite .",
    "for each case we consider trellises with 4 or 16 states and 16 or 64 states , respectively .",
    "the length of the simple error events is @xmath131 for 4,16 and 64 state trellises , respectively .",
    "we assume the codeword length is @xmath132 and the block fading channels are characterized by @xmath133 .",
    "the gst - tcm were optimized in @xcite for the slow fading channel , i.e. , for @xmath134 ( or @xmath45 ) .    in figures [ fig :",
    "comparetcm4stvaryblocke8]-[fig : comparetcm64stvaryblockl8 ] we can see that the best performance is obtained in the slow fading case ( @xmath134 ) , for which the codes were explicitly optimized .",
    "the worst performance appears in the fast fading case ( @xmath46 ) , although the difference is about 1.5 - 2db at fer of @xmath135 and only about 1db at fer of @xmath136 .",
    "note that the slow and fast fading curves will eventually cross , since the fast fading exhibits a higher diversity order .",
    "the intermediate cases of block fading exhibit a performance between the fast and slow , which degrades as @xmath40 decreases .",
    "let us analyze these simulation results using the truncated ub ( [ eq : truncub ] ) .",
    "the sequences of values of @xmath137 in the shortest simple error events of the gst - tcms in figs .",
    "[ fig : comparetcm4stvaryblocke8 ] to [ fig : comparetcm64stvaryblockl8 ] are given in table i , where @xmath138 is the minimum determinant of the golden code .",
    "tables ii - iii show all the code parameters . when @xmath46 or @xmath134 , the term @xmath120 and its multiplicity @xmath116 dominate the performance .",
    "we see that @xmath120 for @xmath134 is always greater than that for @xmath46 , provided @xmath138 and a fixed @xmath116 .",
    "this results in a better performance when @xmath134 .",
    "the same observation can be found for 64-state gst - tcm when @xmath139 .    for the remaining cases , we note that @xmath121 is always smaller than @xmath120 since @xmath138 . as @xmath40 increases the multiplicity @xmath118 of the @xmath121 term decreases , while @xmath116 of the @xmath120 term increases , which results in a better performance .",
    "this analysis qualitatively agrees with the actual performance of the codes .",
    "in this letter , we analyzed the impact of a block fading channel on the performance of gst - tcm by using a truncated ub technique .",
    "the analysis shows that the performance of the gst - tcm designed for slow fading channel varies slightly if the channel condition varies from slow to fast .",
    "it is further demonstrated by simulation that the performance degrades at most 1 db at the fer of @xmath136 , when block fading varies from slow to fast .",
    "this robust coding scheme can be particularly beneficial for high rate transmission in wlans using ofdm to combat widely variable multipath fading .",
