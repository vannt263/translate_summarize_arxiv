    "states in manifolds with non - trivial topologies and entanglement involving such states have close implications to quantum information @xcite and quantum computing @xcite . more specifically , generation of coherent states and their superpositions ( cat states ) @xcite or and ther entanglement ( as epr states @xcite ) in intricate geometrical or topological configurations can give rise to interesting effects .",
    "recent developments of topological qubits @xcite , quantum optics in curved space - time @xcite , topological defects @xcite , graphene and topological isulators @xcite have increased the interest in systems with non - trivial topologies . here",
    "we concentrate on torus and mbius topologies .",
    "different from the known coherent state elaborations for quantum optics @xcite , in non - trivial manifolds , coherent states acquire topological properties , with consequences that affect periodicity and normalization .",
    "this is the case of non - trivial manifolds with topologies of torus @xcite and mobius strip @xcite .",
    "we remark that there is no general method for a construction of coherent states for a particle on an arbitrary manifold , specially when the space is described in a non - trivial topology @xcite .",
    "a general algorithm was introduced by perelomov @xcite for construction of coherent states for homogeneous spaces @xmath0 which are quotients @xmath1 of a lie - group manifold @xmath2 and the stability subgroup @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , in many interesting cases for physics as a particle on a circle , sphere or torus , the phase space whose points should label the coherent states , more precisely a cotangent bundle @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the configuration space , is not a homogeneous space . a general theory of coherent states",
    "when the configuration space has non - trivial topology is far from complete . in view of the lack of the general method for the construction of coherent states one",
    "is forced to study each case of a particle on a concrete manifold separately .",
    "it is worth to point out that coherent states for a quantum particle on circle , sphere and torus have been introduced very recently @xcite . in such cases different constructions of the coherent states ( cs ) in the boson case",
    "are practically straightforward , and a simple addition by hand of @xmath6 to the angular momentum operator @xmath7 for the fermionic case into the corresponding cs remains obscure and non - natural .",
    "the question that naturally arises is if there exists any geometry for the phase space in which the cs construction leads precisely to a fermionic quantization condition . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated the positive answer to this question showing that the cs for a quantum particle on the mobius strip geometry is the natural candidate to describe fermions exactly as the cylinder geometry for bosons .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the entanglement of coherent states on a torus , mobius strip and torus - mobius , i.e. , in the case where two - particle states , one in the torus and other in mobius , are entangled in the intersection of the two manifolds .",
    "taking into account the consistent operators acting in each space and their action on states , we consider the generation of entangled states and non - orthogonal projective measurements , a generalization of von - neumann type measurement , to quantify entanglement .",
    "we also consider the topological and geometrical consequences associated to cs in torus and mobius and the relations of the toroidal operators and entangled torus states to @xmath8 .",
    "we can start with a revision of the quantum mechanics on a torus . such situation , in principle ,",
    "can be identified with product of two circles , this implies , following @xcite , that we can define the algebra @xmath10&=&\\delta_{ij}u_{j } , \\\\",

    "the antiunitary operator of time inversion @xmath25 can be also defined by means of the relations @xmath26 this operator is symmetric and the action on @xmath17 is given by @xmath27 as a consequence @xmath28 can take only four possible values @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 in the coordinate representation of the states on a torus , the following eigenvalue equation is satisfied @xmath36where @xmath37 now , let us define the following operator @xmath38 that mixes operators @xmath39 and @xmath25 , @xmath40the action of this operator on @xmath33 will generate superposition states of the form @xmath41@xmath42as a consequence the even exponents of @xmath38 are eigenvectors of @xmath33 , @xmath43we have then @xmath44",
    "we have been seen in previous references , the action of the creation and annihilation operators corresponding to the generators of the heisenberg - weyl algebra with the basic coherent states of the non - compact oscillator is given as follows @xmath46and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the corresponding eigenvalue of the coherent state .",
    "the importance of such construction is because it describes a unitary representation of the @xmath49 group that is of infinite dimension .",
    "this representattion was used in the case of coherent states in noncompact oscilatrs and also in supergravity models and strings.this specific action of the operators @xmath50over the basic states @xmath51 is clearly isomorphous with the action of the@xmath52 operators defined on the torus making the identification@xmath53and also 2@xmath54 this operator @xmath55 make a cross over from a compact to a non compact structure of the of the geometry of the configuration space .",
    "this point is extreamely important to explain topologically and geometrically speaking the metal / superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "there exists , for instance , a clear possibility to map the sugra ( supergravity ) model @xcite into the torus due the specific action of the operators @xmath55",
    ". a concrete adaptation of the model to metal isulator - transition and sugra - torus correspondence will be the scope of a future work @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "let us first propose an entangled state based on such states @xmath56 we will show that there is an explicit operator capable of realize the building of such state .    here we can only analyse the following properties .",
    "the change under the action of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 has the same action of the operator @xmath59 , is the following @xmath60then , the state is invariant under @xmath57 .",

    "the coherent states on a torus are defined from the relation @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the relation to the states @xmath33 is given by @xmath69 the coherent states can be explicitly written in terms of @xmath70 , using @xmath71 , by means of @xmath72that can also be written as @xmath73 the normalization conditions of ( [ z ] ) are product of jacobi theta functions , here we consider only the case @xmath29 , that is given by @xmath74now , we define two - mode coherent states by means of the product state @xmath75where @xmath76",

    "the coherent states can be reduced from the torus to mobius strip by means of a constraint between the angle variables @xmath84 we will describe this more appropriatelly in a section below .",
    "once we have the a mobius strip parametrization , a deformation can be applied by means of following transformation @xmath85that does not change the topological properties of the mobius strip . in this way a coherent state associated to the mobius strip @xcite is defined by means of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 acts in the @xmath89 mode of @xmath90 and @xmath91",

    "this state is built in a consistent way from the state @xmath97 by means of the action of the operator @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , the operators @xmath59 and @xmath58 discussed previously are in fact actions of the operator @xmath99 that in appropriate conditions leave the state invariant , i.e. , in the forms @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "such operators are important when we search operators that leave a bipartite entangled state invariant @xcite .",
    "now , let us consider the bipartite coherent state for a torus , @xmath100 this can be written as @xmath101 the case where @xmath102 , we can write @xmath103it is interesting to observe that the states @xmath104 and @xmath105 are not equivalents , since @xmath106 and @xmath107 , what implies that the above state is in fact a entangled state .            note that the state ( [ eqlera ] ) with ( [ eq1er ] ) can be associated to the state of photons with orbital angular momentum states",

    "in this section we arise to the question about if the topology of a manifold is sufficient to give a correct description of the physical states living there . in the reference @xcite",
    ", we show the reduction of the toroidal geometry to the mobius strip due the use of suitable projection operators , starting from the torus as the original quantum phase space .    a position point in a mobius strip geometry",
    "can be parameterized by means of specific points @xmath112 and @xmath113 given by @xmath114 where the coordinates of @xmath112 describe a central cylinder , generated from a invariant fiber in the middle of the strip weight , i.e. , @xmath115 this is the topological invariant of the geometry under study . here",
    "@xmath116 is the polar angle , measured from the axis z , and @xmath117 the azimuthal angle .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath113 , the boundaries of the mbius band , are of @xmath118 , the cylinder , plus @xmath119 the band has weight @xmath120 .",
    "this mbius strip configuration has a deep relation with the torus and it is a result of a reduction that changes both topology and geometry by means of a constraint @xmath121 on the torus geometry ( figure [ figtorus ] ) described by        @xmath122    an important point to enphasize is that the angles are no more independent in the case of the mbius strip , leading to a special embedding from the torus .",
    "in such situation , the geometry turns to be an unnoriented surface and the topological properties are also altered .",
    "the consideration @xmath123 implies that the generated mbius strip lives inside the torus .",
    "the parametrization associated to the mbius strip ( figure [ figmobius])is then given by taking @xmath124 and inserting ( 5 ) into ( 4 ) we obtain the parametrization of the band @xmath125",
    "taking the parametrization of the torus we can build the corresponding lagrangean@xmath126 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{m}{2}\\left ( r\\overset{.}{\\theta } \\right ) ^{2}-mr\\ \\sin\\theta \\",

    "the hamiltonian for the torus is easily computed from ( @xmath128 ) @xmath129 where we have @xmath130 this will lead to the following hamiltonian @xmath131 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the insertion of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , the torus reduces to a mobius strip , by legendre transform @xmath127 , we arrive at the above with eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , the hamiltonian for mobius @xmath132 .",
    "the quantized version of both hamiltonians then describe quantum particles on a torus and mobius .",
    "such description has a geometrical base .",
    "the deformation of particles turning around on such surfaces will not alter the topological structure .",
    "the inclusion of the constraint in the torus , eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , reduces the geometrically to a mobius strip inside the torus .",
    "the deformation of the mobius leads to an intersection , but from the topological point of view the topological properties are preserved @xcite .",
    "in order to study the coherent states ( cs ) associated to the mobius strip , we analyse again the cs torus . as we saw previously , in the torus case , the coordinates @xmath133 and @xmath134 are absolutely independent .",
    "thus , we assume two cylinder type parametrizations , one for @xmath135 @xmath136 cylinder with angular variable @xmath134 and other one with finite @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "the above expression correspond to a geometrical factorization , leading to a physical decomposition for @xmath141 that is useful for our proposal is the following @xmath142 @xmath143 i.e. , the mobius strip has its portion splited from the the toroidal space @xmath144 this implies in geometrical and topological changes .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although the topology of the torus is considered as the product of two cilinders , the introduction of the parameter @xmath145 involving the @xmath146 coordinate makes that the torus becames the product of one cilinder with infinity longitude and other with longitude @xmath147 .",
    "the link between geometrical description of the torus and its topological equivalence to two cilinders is given by the following equivalent form for @xmath148 @xmath149 with this we can perform the projection from torus phase space to the mobius phase space by means of @xmath150 @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "it is important to note that we can proceed other time performing the projection from the mobius geometry to the circle straighforwardly obtaining the cs for the bose case .",
    "then the procedure of projections can be sinthetized in the following scheme @xmath153 this in fact connects the aceptions of that the coherent states on mobius topology as fermions and in the circle topology as bosons @xcite",
    ". a periodic circular trajectory of @xmath147 on torus ( figure [ trajtorus ] ) has a bosonic behaviour that can be deformed topologically without losing such characteristic .",
    "the mobius the periodic trajectory of @xmath154 ( figure [ trajmobius ] ) has a fermionic behaviour and can also be deformed without alter the topological properties .",
    "such behaviours in qubits operations acting with deformations that preserve topology .",
    "by considering the coherent states @xmath155 on the mbius strip , we see that their normalization is given in terms of jacobi theta functions , as in the case of a torus @xmath156 taking the approximation formula for theta functions , @xmath157 then , the the projections relations for coherent states on a mobius strip can be written as @xmath158 where the variables with tilde correspond to the coherent state @xmath159 .    on a period in the mobius strip",
    ", the state turns to the same initial state .",
    "in fact , this property for coherent states defined on a mobius strip is a characteristic of the topology associated to this surface .",
    "taking @xmath160 and @xmath161 using the projection in the form ( [ projection ] ) , we can write in a more simplified form @xmath162 but as @xmath163 , we have that the state with a difference in the phase @xmath134 corresponding to the period of a mobius will be the same @xmath164 , as expected from the topology . consequently",
    ", under a period of @xmath154 the state turns to the same .",
    "such behaviour is a characteristic of fermion spin variables and the entanglement and in fact can be associated to entanglements for fermionic systems .",
    "now let us consider the action of the operators restricted to the mobius strip @xmath165 as a consequence the action on the state @xmath166 will be @xmath167 and the state is invariant under the time inversion operator @xmath25 @xmath168 now let us consider the operators @xmath169acting on @xmath170",

    "the mobius is obtained by means of a reduction from the torus by means of a constraint in the angular variables .",

    "we have shown that the entangled state generated in the torus has a characteristic of the experimentally verified photon entanglement by orbital angular momentum , such that the states on torus behave like bosons as a special case .",
    "this is an important fact , since we can associate the entanglement in a torus to a photon entanglement by orbital angular momentum as a special case . on the other hand ,",
    "the entanglement states associated to mobius strip have the periodicity associated to fermions @xmath154 and can be more appropriate to describe the entanglement in fermionic systems .",
    "we also have considered the entanglement between torus and mobius in the intersection of torus and mobius with the action of operators defined in the intersection .",
    "such situation can be originated in the case of an entanglement by spin - orbit coupling . by derive non - orthogonal measurements ,",

    "the periodic trajectories on torus ( @xmath147 ) and mobius ( @xmath154 ) surfaces can be deformed topologically without alter the typical behaviours .",
    "such behaviours are also reflected in the entangled states for torus and mobius and are important when we consider deformation operations .",
