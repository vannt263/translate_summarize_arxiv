    "accretion disk outflows are an important part of the quasar phenomenon .",
    "they are known to be present in at least 50% of optically - selected quasars @xcite .",
    "they might play a critical role in the accretion physics and in the observational properties of quasars , and they might expel enough metal - rich gas and kinetic energy to have a major impact on star formation and galaxy evolution in their surroundings @xcite .",
    "the outflows appear most conspicuously in quasar spectra as broad absorption lines ( bals ) , which typically have velocity widths of 500020,000 km s@xmath2 . however , there is also a variety of weaker and narrower outflow lines that are just as common as bals .",
    "these include the so - called `` mini''-bals , which appear at velocities from near 0 to @xmath30.2@xmath9 with profile widths from the bal range down to a few hundred km s@xmath2 .",
    "understanding the relationships between the various outflow lines is fundamental to our understanding of the outflows themselves .",
    "for example , in one scenario , the different line types represent different manifestations of a single outflow phenomenon viewed at different angles @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they might represent an evolutionary sequence , where weak mini - bals appear near the beginning or end of a more powerful bal outflow phase @xcite .",
    "variability studies can help test these ideas by providing constraints on the outflow dynamics , stability , location and basic physical properties .",
    "recent studies have shown , for example , that mini - bals tend to be more variable than the broader and stronger bals @xcite .",
    "approximately half of mini - bals show significant variations on time scales from a few years to few months in the quasar rest - frame . in rare cases ,",
    "weak mini - bals become much stronger and broader like bals , or they disappear altogether . following",
    "the emergence of a quasar outflow would be particularly valuable , but we know almost nothing about such occurances because variability programs start with quasars that are already known to have outflow lines .",
    "the only known case of an emerging bal outflow was in a narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy at redshift @xmath30.03 @xcite .",
    "the dramatic appearance of bals in this object is surprising because it is much less luminous ( by a factor of @xmath10100 ) than typical bal quasars .    in this paper , we report the first discovery of an emerging high - velocity bal - like outflow in a luminous quasar , j105400.40 + 034801.2 at redshift @xmath32.1 . we observed this quasar as part of a program to study metal - strong damped ly@xmath11 ( dla ) absorption systems @xcite .",
    "those data showed the new appearance of broad outflow lines compared to spectra obtained several years earlier by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . in the sections below",
    "we discuss the observations (  2 ) , the measured properties of the outflow lines (  3 ) , and some theoretical implications of our results (  4 ) .",
    "the sloan digitial sky survey ( sdss ) obtained the first high - quality spectrum of j105400.40 + 034801.2 on 5 march 2002 ( 2002.18 ) .",
    "we retrieved the fully reduced spectrum from the sdss archives , data release 6 .",
    "this spectrum covers wavelengths from 3805   to 9210   at resolution @xmath12 ( 150 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the absolute fluxes measured through through a @xmath33@xmath13 aperture fiber are expected to be accurate to within a few percent @xcite .",
    "the emission line redshift and the blue and red magnitudes reported by the sdss are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we also note that this quasar is radio - quiet based on a non - detection in the first radio survey @xcite .",
    "we observed j105400.40 + 034801.2 on 16 december 2006 ( 2006.96 ) using the multi - mirrored telescope ( mmt ) spectrograph in the blue channel with the 800 groove / mm grating .",
    "combined with a 1.5@xmath13 wide slit , this setup provided wavelength coverage from 3090   to 5095   at resolution @xmath17 ( 220 km s@xmath2 ) . the exposure time was 720 s. after noticing the broad outflow lines in the mmt data , we obtained another spectrum on 30 may 2008 ( 2008.48 ) using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) at the keck observatory . in this case , a 600 groove / mm grating blazed at 6000   and a 1@xmath13 entrance slit provided wavelength coverage from 3105   to 5600   at resolution @xmath18 ( 300 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the total exposure time was 400 s. the observations at the mmt and keck were both performed with the slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "the spectra were extracted and processed by standard techniques using the low redux pipelinexavier / lowredux / index.html ] software package .",
    "the relative fluxes were calibrated using spectrophotometric standards observed on the same night .",
    "the absolute fluxes have uncertainties up to 50% .",
    "figure 1 shows the three spectra obtained in 2002.18 ( sdss ) , 2006.96 ( mmt ) and 2008.41 ( keck ) .",
    "the wavelengths in the quasar rest frame are based on @xmath14 reported by the sdss .",
    "the vertical flux scale in the figure applies to the sdss spectrum .",
    "the other spectra are scaled vertically to match the sdss fluxes at continuum wavelengths .",
    "the sdss and mmt spectra are shown after smoothing for easier display",
    ". this smoothing has no effect on the appearance of broad features like the outflow lines and the broad emission lines ( bels ) .",
    "broad high - velocity outflow lines are clearly present in  @xmath19@xmath191394,1403 and  @xmath19@xmath191548,1551 in the 2006.96 and 2008.48 spectra",
    ". they appeared in @xmath201.54 yr ( rest frame ) between the 2002.18 and 2006.96 observations , and then they weakened again 0.47 years later in the 2008.48 measurement .",
    "meanwhile , the bel profiles and equivalent widths ( including ly@xmath11 and ] @xmath191909 not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) varied by @xmath45% .",
    "the discovery spectrum of j105400.40 + 034801.2 obtained in 1988.15 @xcite is much noisier and has a lower resolution ( @xmath21 ) than the data shown in figure 1 .",
    "outflow lines like the ones measured in 2006.96 would probably not be detectable in those data .",
    "however , the 1988.15 spectrum does rule out the presence of broad absorption features with @xmath32 or more times the strength of the lines in 2006.96 .",
    "no other outflow lines in the broad outflow system are detected in any of the data .",
    "the 2006.96 and 2008.48 spectra both have a depression at the position of  @xmath19@xmath191239,1243 that is consistent with the broad absorption in  and .",
    "however , we can not confirm the reality of this feature because the spectra at those wavelengths are severely contaminated by ly@xmath11 forest lines .    to measure the outflow lines quantitatively",
    ", we define a  pseudo \"-",
    "continuum across the true quasar continuum and the tops of the bels .",
    "this pseudo - continuum matches the 2008.48 spectrum except at the wavelengths of the broad absorption , where it follows the 2002.18 data .",
    "the result is shown in the top panel of figure 2 .",
    "notice that the pseudo - continuum ignores the bump in the 2002.18 sdss spectrum around 3900   ( 1260   rest ) .",
    "we attribute this bump to an anomaly in the sdss flux calibration . our experience with many similar sdss spectra indicates that anomalies like this do sometimes occur near the blue edge of the sdss wavelength coverage . in any case ,",
    "this feature is not related to the  outflow line because it has no analog near the  feature .",
    "the bottom panel in figure 2 shows the 2006.96 and 2008.48 spectra normalized by the pseudo - continuum .",
    "we fit the broad  and  absorption lines in these normalized spectra using gaussian optical depth profiles .",
    "the  and  transitions are doublets with velocity separations of @xmath3500 km s@xmath2  and @xmath31930 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "our fits include one gaussian per doublet member , with the redshifts and doppler velocities tied together .",
    "we assume that the doublet members have equal strengths based on the evidence for line saturation described in  4.1 . in our fitting procedure , this means forcing the optical depths within the doublets to be equal even though their actual ratios based on oscillator strengths should be 2:1 .",
    "the fits assume implicitly that the absorbing gas fully covers the quasar emission regions .",
    "we will discuss the effects of partial covering and line saturation in  4.1 below .",
    "figure 2 shows the final fits to the broad outflow lines .",
    "table 1 lists some of the derived results , including the rest equivalent width ( rew ) of the entire blended doublet , and the absorption redshift ( @xmath22 ) , the velocity shift ( @xmath23 measured from @xmath24 ) , the full width at half minimum ( fwhm ) of the individual doublet lines , and the logarithmic ionic column density ( @xmath25 ) derived from the weaker doublet members .",
    "note that the column densities are lower limits because of probable saturation effects (  4.1 ) .",
    "@lccccc@ line & rew & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & fhwm & @xmath25 + & (  ) & & ( km s@xmath2 ) & ( km s@xmath2 ) & ( @xmath26 ) +   + si iv & 6.21 & 1.833 & 26,430 & 4830 & @xmath2714.84 + c iv & 4.83 & 1.835 & 26,270 & 3660 & @xmath2715.08 +   + si iv & 4.07 & 1.838 & 25,900 & 4330 & @xmath2714.66 + c iv & 2.54 & 1.830 & 26,810 & 3160 & @xmath2714.80 +    the broad outflow lines in 2006.96 had velocity shifts @xmath1 km s@xmath2  and deblended fwhms near @xmath34000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the actual measured width of the  blend was fwhm @xmath3 4320 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these features are strong and broad enough to be considered bals .",
    "however , their large velocity shifts lead to a balnicity index of zero , which excludes them from the standard bal definition @xcite",
    ". their appearance in 2006.96 corresponds to strengthening by at least a factor of @xmath35 compared to the 2002.18 observation .",
    "then they became roughly @xmath340% weaker and 10% to 15% narrower by 2008.48 .",
    "the uncertainties in our measured results are difficult to assess .",
    "the  data should be more reliable than  because the spectra at the  wavelengths are less noisy and there is less blending with underlying bels .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for the different fwhms and velocity shifts reported for  and  lines in table 1 in terms of our fits to the lines or the pseudo - continuum .",
    "these differences might be real , or they might be indications of the true measurement uncertainties , mostly in the  line .",
    "if the outflow gas does not fully cover the background emission regions , then our line fits in  3 will underestimate the true optical depths and column densities .",
    "partial covering appears to be common in bals and it is well documented in many narrow - line outflow systems where resolved doublets provide direct measures of the covering fractions and true optical depths @xcite .",
    "the net result can be shallow optically thick lines whose strengths and profiles are controlled by a velocity - dependent covering fraction .    in the j105400.40 + 034801.2 outflow",
    ", we can not constrain the true optical depths based on resolved doublet ratios . however , standard photoionization models applied to quasar outflows predict that the optical depth in  should be at least 5 times larger than  if the si / c abundance is roughly solar and the degree of ionization favors si@xmath28 and c@xmath28 over other ions @xcite . the observed /   absorption ratio near unity in weak lines",
    "strongly suggests that both features are saturated .",
    "their measured line depths then imply that the covering fraction was @xmath320% ( at line center ) in 2006.96 .",
    "in addition , the velocity shift of the outflow lines leads to little or no absorption at the bel wavelengths ( figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath320% covering fraction applies to the background continuum source .",
    "we can place some interesting constraints on the outflow physical properties by making a few reasonable assumptions .",
    "for example , in the photoionization calculations just mentioned , our lower limit on the si@xmath28 column density in 2006.96 ( table 1 ) corresponds to a total hydrogen column of @xmath29 if the si / h abundance is roughly solar . in the more likely event",
    "that the  line is saturated with line - center optical depth @xmath30 (  4.1 ) , the total column density in the absorber would be @xmath6 .",
    "partial covering of the quasar continuum source (  4.1 ) implies that the absorbing region is small . the radius of the accretion disk continuum source at 1550   is expected to be roughly @xmath31 cm in luminous quasars like j105400.40 + 034801.2 ergs s@xmath2 based on the observed sdss flux at 1450   ( rest ) , a cosmology with @xmath32 km s@xmath2  mpc , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and a standard bolometric correction factor @xmath35 .",
    "this implies characteristic radii for the continuum source at 1550   of @xmath31 cm and for the  bel region of @xmath36 cm @xcite . ] . in simple geometries",
    ", the 20% covering fraction indicates a characteristic absorber radius of @xmath3@xmath5 cm .",
    "( we do not consider the possibility of continuum flux scattered from some larger region because the @xmath320% covering fraction would require that @xmath1080% of the observed continuum is scattered light . )",
    "comparing this size to the minimum column density above indicates further that the average volume density is @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the outflow dynamical times are interesting for comparison to the observed variabilities .",
    "bal - like outflows are believed to be launched from a rotating accretion disk , and the  absorption lines might form at radii just beyond the  bel region @xcite .",
    "a characteristic flow time in this situation would be @xmath37 yr , where @xmath1 km s@xmath2  is the flow speed and @xmath38 is the civ bel region radius@xmath39 .",
    "the transit time for absorbing clouds crossing the 1550   continuum source depends on the transverse velocities in the flow ( i.e. , perpendicular to our lines of sight ) .",
    "if the transverse velocities in the  and  absorbing gas are similar to the disk rotation speed just beyond @xmath38 , roughly @xmath40 km s@xmath2 , then the transit time would be @xmath41 yr . thus it appears that the transit time is more compatible with the observations than the overall flow time .",
    "did a new bal - like outflow emerge from a situation where there was previously no outflow at all ?",
    "we can not answer that question except to note that there were no indications of structural changes in the accretion disk that might signal the onset of an outflow .",
    "in particular , the bels and near - uv spectral slope did not change significantly during the absorption line variability period , and we can rule out large ( factor of @xmath102 ) changes in the near - uv flux .",
    "there are also no clear signs of acceleration .",
    "if a new outflow did emerge in j105400.40 + 034801.2 , it probably appeared in our line of sight as si@xmath28 and c@xmath28 after the acceleration to @xmath1 km s@xmath2   had already occurred .",
    "the emergence of outflow lines might have been caused by changes in the ionization or by the movement of gas across our lines of sight .",
    "changes in the ionization are an unlikely explanation for several reasons .",
    "first , the  and  bels did not vary .",
    "their ionization is controlled by the same far - uv flux that controls the  and  absorption lines .",
    "changes in quasar continuum fluxes are known to cause changes in the bels after a time lag related to the light travel time between the continuum source and the bel region .",
    "the lag time for the  bel in j105400.40 + 034801.2 should be about half a year in the rest frame@xmath39 .",
    "therefore , substantial changes in the far - uv flux should have been evident in the civ bel .",
    "second , weak  and  absorption lines affected by changes in the ionization should exhibit measurable changes in the /  line ratio ( see the photoionization calculations mentioned in  4.1 ) .",
    "this did not occur in j105400.40 + 034801.2 because the lines are optically thick .",
    "their strengths depend on the covering fraction much more than the degree of ionization .",
    "we conclude that the outflow line variations were caused by changes in the covering fraction related to the movement of gas across our line of sight ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our crude estimate of the crossing time , @xmath31 yr (  4.2 ) , is broadly consistent with this conclusion .",
    "instabilities might also play a role by producing transient flow structures capable of  and  absorption .",
    "however , instabilities might be expected evolve on roughly a flow time , @xmath37 yr (  4.2 ) , which is perhaps too slow to explain the observations .",
    "better assessments of the origins of the variability will require detailed hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we have described the first known case of an emerging broad - line outflow in a luminous high - redshift quasar , j105400.40 + 034801.2 .",
    "the outflow is evident in  and  absorption lines having fwhm @xmath42 km s@xmath2  and velocity shifts @xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these features are not technically bals because their large velocity shifts lead to a balnicity index of zero .",
    "nonetheless , they represent a powerful outflow with @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the outflow lines appeared between two observations 1.54 yr apart in the quasar rest frame .",
    "a third observation 0.47 yr later shows the lines becoming weaker again by @xmath340% .",
    "we attribute this behavior to a substantial flow structure crossing our line of sight to the continuum source .",
    "overall , the outflow lines discussed here are similar to high - velocity mini - bals observed in other quasars @xcite .",
    "these features are characteristically narrower , weaker and more variable than the classic strong bals .",
    "one possible explanation for these outflow lines is that they form along the ragged edge of the main bal outflow , where the flow structures could be naturally smaller and more volatile . if bal outflows are typically clumpy or filamentary @xcite , then perhaps the mini - bals represent individual clumps or filaments along the edges of these flows .",
    "another possibility is that mini - bals and other similar outflow lines represent the sputtering beginning or end stages of a bal evolutionary phase",
    ". continued monitoring of quasars like j105400.40 + 034801.2 , e.g. , with multi - wavelength measurements to get better constraints on the ionization and column densities , will help to test these theoretical ideas .",
