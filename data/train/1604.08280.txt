    "symmetry and topology are two foundational principles that shape our understanding of matter . in the last decade , our understanding of their interplay has led to dramatic progress in our understanding of topological electronic phases .",
    "a hallmark of this development is the topological insulator .",
    "insulating states with time reversal symmetry fall into two distinct topological phases that are separated by a topological quantum critical point@xcite . for non - interacting systems described by the band theory ,",
    "our understanding of such topological phenomena is highly developed , and there are many well understood examples of topological states protected by different types of symmetry , such as time - reversal symmetry@xcite , particle - hole symmetry@xcite , spin rotation symmetry@xcite , as well as crystal symmetries@xcite .",
    "a current frontier is to develop a similar understanding of symmetry protected topological phenomena in strongly interacting systems@xcite .",
    "since the general many - body problem is notoriously difficult , a promising approach is to consider the simplest version of a strongly interacting symmetry protected topological state : one which occurs in a @xmath9 dimensional quantum impurity problem .",
    "the archetypal quantum impurity problem is the kondo problem@xcite , along with its multichannel variants@xcite .",
    "previous works have explored the kondo physics in closely related problems , such as resonant tunneling in non - abelian quantum hall states coupled to a quantum dot@xcite , fractional quantum hall / normal - metal junctions in the strongly coupling regime@xcite and resonant tunneling through a weak link in an interacting one dimensional electron gas - or a luttinger liquid @xcite .    in this paper , we revisit the resonant tunneling problem in a luttinger liquid .",
    "this problem was studied extensively in the 1990s@xcite , where it was found that for spinless electrons with repulsive interactions ( described by a luttinger parameter @xmath10 with @xmath11 ) an arbitrarily weak barrier leads to an insulating behavior in the limit of zero temperature . however , for @xmath12 it is possible , by tuning two parameters , to achieve a resonance with perfect conductance at zero temperature . at small but finite temperature ,",
    "the line shape of the resonance is described by a universal crossover scaling function that connects two renormalization group fixed points : the perfectly transmitting ( small barrier ) fixed point and the perfectly reflecting ( large barrier ) fixed point .",
    "it was further observed that for symmetric barriers , a perfect resonance could be achieved by tuning only a _ single",
    "_ parameter . here",
    "we observe that this is an example of symmetry protected topological critical point separating two topologically distinct symmetry protected insulating states . in the presence of inversion symmetry a one dimensional insulator",
    "is characterized by a quantized polarization , which takes two values : @xmath13 mod @xmath14 or @xmath15 mod @xmath14@xcite .",
    "likewise , for our resonant tunneling problem , we can define a polarization @xmath16 mod @xmath14 to distinguish different symmetry protected topological phases .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of charges transferred across the infinite barrier in the large - barrier limit . without an inversion symmetric barrier , @xmath16 can take any continous value . with an inversion symmetric barrier , in the large barrier limit , @xmath17 or @xmath18 mod @xmath14 , which characterizes two insulating phases .",
    "these insulating states are topologically distinct : one can not go smoothly from one phase to the other without going through a topological quantum critical point - the perfectly transmitting fixed point . for @xmath12 ,",
    "this critical point has only a single relevant operator in the presence of inversion symmetry .",
    "for the special value @xmath19 , this fixed point can also be identified with the non - fermi liquid fixed point of the two - channel kondo problem , described by a @xmath20 conformal field theory@xcite .",
    "armed with this insight we consider resonances in a spinful luttinger liquid , which will lead us to a class of symmetry protected resonance fixed points that was not studied in detail in the early work . a spinful luttinger liquid",
    "is characterized by two luttinger parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath5 spin symmetry fixing @xmath23 . and",

    ", the system can achieve perfect resonance by tuning a single parameter for @xmath25 .",
    "this resonance , which is controlled by the perfectly transmitting fixed point , corresponds to a transition between insulating phases characterized by a polarization @xmath26 .",
    "this polarization reflects whether or not a pair of electrons with opposite spins is transferred across the infinite barrier in the large - barrier limit . with inversion and time - reversal symmetry ,",
    "the only possible values of @xmath26 are @xmath27 or @xmath14 mod @xmath28 . when @xmath29 , the perfectly transmitting fixed point becomes unstable even on resonance .",
    "in that case a new kind of insulating phase emerges characterized by @xmath30 mod @xmath28 .",
    "even though , like the other two insulating phases , the new phase is charge insulating , with time - reversal symmetry , the spin degree of freedom in this phase is not completed locked due to the fact that an unpaired spin can be transferred across resulting in a finite conductance for spin .",
    "transitions between these insulating states are governed by a quantum critical point that can not be described by a free luttinger liquid fixed point .",
    "rather , it is an _ intermediate _",
    "fixed point@xcite , which could only be described in certain perturbative limits . here",
    "we will show that like the spinless case there is a special value of @xmath31 for which the nontrivial fixed point maps to a two - channel @xmath3 kondo problem , described by a @xmath4 conformal field theory@xcite . this analysis allows us to compute the nontrivial on - resonance conductance , as well as the scaling behavior of the width of the resonance as a function of temperature , which is determined by the dimension of the leading relevant operators at the nontrivial fixed point .",

    "insight into the relationships between the resonant tunneling problem and the kondo problem is provided by mapping both problems to a quantum brownian motion model@xcite . in the case of a spinful luttinger liquid , the single impurity problem maps to a quantum brownian motion on a two dimensional lattice .",

    "lattice , when they are tuned to an appropriate toulouse limit@xcite .",
    "we will show that this , in turn is closely related to the quantum brownian motion on a _ honeycomb _ lattice , which was shown earlier to be related to the three - channel @xmath5 kondo problem .",

    "ii , we review symmetry protected topological phases for both the spinless and spinful luttinger liquid . in section iii , we analyze our resonant tunneling problem which maps to a quantum brownian motion model on a kagome lattice at the toulouse limit . from the quantum brownian motion model , an intermediate fixed point",
    "is identified .",
    "then we show how our resonant tunneling problem maps to a two - channel @xmath3 kondo problem which comes handy for later analysis of the same fixed point . in section iv , utilizing the boundary conformal field theory , we calculate the on - resonance conductance and by identifying the  knob \" controlling resonance we determine the critical exponent determining the scaling of the resonance line - shape with temperature . in section",
    "v , we show that the quantum brownian motion on both the honeycomb lattice and the kagome lattice flows to the same fixed point characterized by its mobility which manifests the so called level - rank duality .",
    "we also point out some generalizations .",
    "let us first take a look at the resonant tunneling problem in a spinless luttinger liquid@xcite",

    "scattering of electrons from coupling to a potential @xmath45 adds @xmath46 to the hamiltonian .",
    "assuming @xmath47 varies slowly on the scale of the potential and @xmath45 is nonzero only near @xmath48 , integrating out fluctuations in @xmath47 away from zero , the effective action becomes @xmath49 plus an extra term corresponding to the effect of the potential : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are fourier components of @xmath45 at momenta @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the matsubara frequency .",
    "the extra term serves as the effective weak pinning potential for our resonant tunneling problem and we denote it as @xmath54 $ ] . to leading order in the backscattering , the rg flow equations are @xmath55 notice that for @xmath12",
    ", the only relevant perturbation is the backscattering term at @xmath56 : @xmath57 in general , the system achieves resonance by tuning the two coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 . with inversion symmetric barrier ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "@xmath61 is a real number and therefore only one parameter needs to be tuned .    at the opposite limit - the large - barrier limit , it is not hard to see that a convenient representation of the action should be in @xmath36 variables since @xmath35s must be locked in the minimum of cosine potential and can not change continuously .",
    "any perturbation away from this limit can be represented as hopping processes of electrons across the infinite barrier .",
    "we denote the strength of hopping as @xmath62 .",
    "is the gate voltage on the quantum dot one can tune to achieve resonance at @xmath63.,width=288 ]    from fig .",
    "2 , we see there are two inversion symmetry protected topological insulating phases for @xmath12 when the system flows into the large - barrier limit and they are separated by the perfect transmitting fixed point . if we choose the center of inversion as our origin , then for one insulating phase ( @xmath64 ) , with the infinite barrier , we must have @xmath54 $ ] pinned in the potential minimum which is at @xmath65 .",

    "the two phases are topologically robust since the transition between them is only possible by tuning the system through resonance(tuning @xmath61 through 0 ) . on resonance",
    ", we know the system is perfectly transmitting and electrons move freely .",
    "therefore , our transition is analogous to the transition from a topological insulator to an ordinary insulator@xcite .",
    "both transitions go from one insulating phase to another insulating phase via a conducting state .",
    "of course the conducting state for topological / ordinary insulator transition refers to the familiar band gap closure .    the resonant problem in a spinless luttinger liquid provides the simplest example of a @xmath69 system with symmetry protected topological phases .",
    "the paradigm here is to recognize the perfect resonance fixed point as the symmetry - protected quantum critical point separating symmetry - protected topological phases .    adopting this new interpretation ,",
    "let us now move on to the resonant problem in a spinful luttinger liquid . for electrons with spin , we have two luttinger parameters , the dimensionless conductance @xmath21 and the dimensionless  spin conductance \" @xmath22 which describes the spin - current response to a magnetic field .",
    "for each spin @xmath70 , there are two bosonic fields @xmath71 .",
    "it is convenient to separate them into charge and spin degrees of freedom : @xmath72 in the small - barrier limit , there are two competing perturbation terms in the action which are most relevant for @xmath73 and @xmath74@xcite @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the process that backscatters an electron and @xmath78 is the process that backscatters an up - spin and also a down - spin electron .",
