    "[ [ section ] ]    the basic problem considered in this paper is the following .",
    "let @xmath1 be a locally finite subset of @xmath2 and @xmath3 be a positive  valued function on @xmath1 with finite moments : @xmath4    fix a positive integer @xmath5 ( the number of particles ) and consider the probability measure on all @xmath5-point subsets of @xmath1 given by @xmath6 we are interested in the distribution of @xmath7 with respect to this measure .",
    "the problem is motivated by random matrix theory on one side , and by combinatorial and representation theoretic models on the other one .    in random matrix theory , probability measures of the form @xmath8 on @xmath5-point subsets of @xmath2 , with @xmath9 being a smooth function on a subinterval of @xmath2 ,",
    "play a prominent role .",
    "most computations for such models are conveniently done by means of the orthogonal polynomials associated with the weight function @xmath9 . on this ground , these measures are often called _ orthogonal polynomial ensembles_. see @xcite , @xcite and references therein for a further discussion .",
    "the problem of describing the distribution of the @xmath10 in the continuous setting for the classical weights has been solved in the following sense : the distribution function was explicitly written in terms of a specific solution of one of the six ( 2nd order nonlinear ordinary differential ) painlev equations .",
    "it was done in @xcite for the hermite weight @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and for the laguerre weight @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; in @xcite , @xcite for the jacobi weight @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; and in @xcite , @xcite for the quasi - jacobi weight @xmath17 , @xmath12 .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask what would be an analog of these results when we take @xmath18 to be a classical _ discrete _ weight function .    on the other hand , in recent years the random variable @xmath10 with",
    "@xmath19 s distributed according to ( [ ] ) 1 with certain specific weights , came up as the main quantity of interest in a number of problems originating in combinatorics , first - passage percolation , representation theory , and growth processes , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "[ [ assumps ] ]    in order to state our first result we need to introduce more notation .",
    "let us denote the points of @xmath1 by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 or @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 may be finite or infinite .",
    "we use the following two basic assumptions :    * there exists an affine transformation @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "* there exist polynomials @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the orthogonality data for a number ( but not all ) hypergeometric polynomials of the askey scheme satisfy these assumptions , see ",

    "is not locally finite .",
    "we extend our results to those cases , see  [ s : fredholm ] below . ]",
    "we prove that under the two conditions above , there exists a certain recurrence procedure which computes the _ gap probability _",
    "@xmath33 with @xmath19 s distributed according to ( [ ] ) 1 .",
    "in fact , the recurrence procedure produces a sequence @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a nilpotent 2 by 2 matrix and @xmath36 is a matrix polynomial @xmath37 of degree @xmath38 .",
    "the elementary step of the recurrence is provided by the equality @xmath39 it is not hard to see that if @xmath40 ( which is always the case in our setting ) then ( [ ] ) 2 defines @xmath41 uniquely provided that we know @xmath42 . however , the existence of @xmath41 is not obvious and needs to be proved .",
    "are rational functions of @xmath43 . ] again , in our setting it always holds .",
    "we then show that the ratio @xmath44 is an explicit rational function of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    since @xmath47 is nonzero only if @xmath48 ( recall that @xmath5 is the number of @xmath19 s in ( [ ] ) 1 ) ,",
    "it is enough to provide the initial conditions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 in order to be able to compute @xmath52 for arbitrary @xmath27 .",
    "these initial conditions are readily expressed in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , see ",
    "[ s : initial ] below .    for certain classical weights",
    "@xmath18 the recurrence relation ( [ ] ) 2 can be substantially simplified .",
    "to illustrate the situation , let us consider @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a parameter .",
    "this weight function corresponds to the charlier orthogonal polynomials .    in this case",
    ", @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be parameterized by three scalar sequences @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 as follows : @xmath61 then the equality ( [ ] ) 2 leads to the following recurrence relations : @xmath62 the connection of these sequences and the distribution @xmath52 is given by @xmath63 the corresponding initial conditions can be found in subsection [ ss : charlier ] .    under the change of variables",
    "@xmath64 ( [ ] ) 4-([])5 turn into @xmath65 this recurrence is immediately identified with the difference painlev iv equation ( dpiv ) of @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    it turns out that the situation for the charlier weight described above is rather typical .",
    "we are also able to reduce ( [ ] ) 2 to scalar rational recurrence relations for the weight functions corresponding to meixner , krawtchouk , q - charlier , alternative q - charlier , little q - laguerre / wall , little q - jacobi , and q - krawtchouk orthogonal polynomials . in the appropriate variables , meixner and krawtchouk cases lead to dpv of @xcite , little q - jacobi and q - krawtchouk lead to q - pvi of @xcite , @xcite , and q - charlier and little q - laguerre yield a certain degeneration of q - pvi .",
    "it is remarkable that in almost all the cases we can solve explicitly , we end up with one of the equations of sakai s hierarchy which was constructed out of purely algebraic geometric considerations , see @xcite .",
    "( we were not able to see such a reduction in the alternative q - charlier case , but we do not claim that there is none . )",
    "so far we have not found a conceptual explanation for this fact .",
    "one can notice , however , that recurrence relations originating from ( [ ] ) 2 must have some kind of singularity confinement property .",
    "( this property was the starting point of sakai s work . ) for example , the parameterization ( [ ] ) 3 does not make much sense if , say , @xmath35 has a zero ( 2,1 ) element .",
    "then the values of @xmath58 and @xmath60 are not well  defined . in terms of the recurrence relations",
    ", this is reflected by vanishing of one of the denominators in ( [ ] ) 4-([])6 .",
    "however , the matrix sequence @xmath66 does not feel this singularity , which means that the sequences @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 can be `` continued through '' their singular values .",
    "of course , all sakai s equations have this kind of singularity confinement by construction .",
    "let us also point out that it is not clear at this point whether the weights of higher hypergeometric polynomials of the askey scheme will also lead to one of sakai s equations .",
    "all the cases that we were able to solve explicitly have _ linear _ matrices @xmath36 in ( [ ] ) 2 , while , say , for the hahn weight @xmath36 is quadratic .",
    "handling such cases seems to be a problem of the next level of difficulty .",
    "it remains an interesting open problem to derive explicit rational recurrence relations for @xmath70 .    for charlier and meixner weights ,",
    "@xmath52 can also be written as toeplitz determinants with symbols @xmath71 respectively , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here @xmath72 are parameters . among previous results on the subject",
    "let us mention    * the derivation of dpii for toeplitz determinants with the symbol @xmath73 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( note also the derivation of the same equation for the quantity closely related to these toeplitz determinants in @xcite , @xcite ) ; * derivation of dpv for toeplitz determinants with symbol @xmath74 and @xmath5 being not necessarily integral in @xcite ; * derivation of rational recurrence relations for toeplitz determinants with symbols of the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are polynomials with @xmath78 , @xmath79 are constants , see @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , for the symbols ( [ ] ) 7 , which are special cases of ( [ ] ) 8 , the relations of @xcite do not seem to have much in common with those of @xcite and the present paper .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the methods used in this paper are based on the formalism of discrete integrable operators and discrete riemann  hilbert problem ( drhp ) developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first step is to represent @xmath52 as a fredholm determinant of an integrable operator : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an operator in @xmath82 with the kernel @xmath83 here @xmath84 and @xmath85 are monic @xmath5th and @xmath86st orthogonal polynomials on @xmath1 with respect to the weight function @xmath18 . using the results of @xcite , @xcite , the computation of such a fredholm determinant",
    "can be reduced to solving a drhp on @xmath87 with a jump matrix easily expressible in terms of @xmath18 .",
