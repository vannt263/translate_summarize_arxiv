    "a class of interaction potentials in quantum mechanics characterized by the hamiltonian , @xmath0\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , have found widespread applications in many areas of atomic , molecular , nuclear physics and are often referred as the spiked harmonic oscillators ( sho ) . here @xmath2 formally denotes the simple harmonic oscillator hamiltonian ; the coupling parameter @xmath3 determines the strength of the perturbative potential and the positive constant @xmath4 represents the type of singularity at the origin .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath3 , the higher the singularity .",
    "there has been an upsurge of interest [ 1 - 20 ] to calculate the sho eigenvalues over the past three decades and it continues to grow .",
    "an interesting feature of this potential is that once the perturbation @xmath5 is switched on , complete turn - off is impossible ; vestigial effects of the interaction persists leading to the so called  klauder phenomenon \" [ 1,2 ] . from a purely mathematical viewpoint , on the other hand",
    ", this poses considerable challenges to some of the well - established and widely used mathematical theories . for example , the commonly used rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series diverges [ 3 ] according to the relation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the order of the perturbation term .",
    "consequently , a singular perturbation theory was to be specially devised to treat these potentials .",
    "these potentials also exhibit the phenomenon of _ supersingularity _ [ 1 ] in the region of @xmath8 i.e. , every matrix element of the potential is infinite",
    ". the numerical solutions of the pertinent schrdinger equations are notoriously difficult as well ; especially those involving the finite - difference ( fd ) schemes and often require special care .    several analytical ( both variational and perturbative ) methodologies [ 3 - 20 ] are available for the exact and approximate calculation of these systems .",
    "for example , the modified ( nonpower ) perturbation series [ 3 ] to finite order for the ground - state eigenenergies valid for small values of @xmath3 and arbitrary values of @xmath4 , a large coupling perturbative expansion [ 5 ] for the approximate estimates of the same for large positive values of @xmath3 , the weak coupling expansion expressions of the nonsingular ( @xmath9 ) sho through the resummation technique for @xmath10 [ 6 ] and for @xmath11 [ 10 ] , the exact and approximate ( variational ) solutions [ 8 ] for some particular values of the parameters in the interaction potential , a modified wkb treatment [ 11 ] , etc . besides",
    ", the upper and lower bounds of ground and excited states [ 12 - 16 ] of the sho as well as the generalized sho , the analytical pseudoperturbation shifted-@xmath12 expansion technique ( pslet ) [ 19,20 ] have also been developed .",
    "the extensions to n - dimensions are reported lately [ 14,20 ] . on the numerical side , the fd methods [ 21,22 ] through richardson extrapolation , integration of the schrdinger equation [ 23 ] using a lanczos grid method for the cases of @xmath13 for small values of the ( @xmath14 ) , the analytic continuation method [ 24 ] for ground and excited states",
    "have been reported .",
    "despite all these attempts , a general prescription which can accurately and reliably calculate the bound states of these potentials in a uniform and simple way for a general set of potential parameters with the promise of furnishing ground and excited states with equal ease , would be highly desirable .",
    "this is because physically meaningful and good accuracy results are obtainable only by some of these methods .",
    "additionally some of these methods can give satisfactory results for a certain type of parameters while perform rather poorly in other cases .",
    "much attention has been paid to the ground states ; excited states are reported less frequently and definitively , presumably because of the greater challenges compared to the ground states . moreover ,",
    "much work has been devoted to the eigenvalues ; only few results are available for the _ eigenfunctions_[15 ] . also some of these methodologies are often fraught with rather tedious and cumbersome mathematical complexities .",
    "this work proposes a simple methodology to study these systems by using the gps scheme which has shown considerable promise for a variety of atomic and molecular processes including both static and dynamic situations in recent years ( see , for example [ 25 - 29 ] and the references therein ) .",
    "this formalism helps alleviate some of the well - known discomfitures of the fd schemes widely used and discussed in the literature [ 5,21,22,30 ] , e.g. , the necessity of significantly larger spatial grid points to deal with the singularity at the origin .",
    "the gps method essentially works in a _",
    "nonuniform _ and _ optimal _ spatial grid ; thus a much smaller number of points suffices to achieve good accuracy .",
    "however its applicability has been so far restricted to the cases of coulomb singularities ; no attempts have been made to deal with the other singularities characterizing many physical systems .",
    "the objective of this letter is two - fold : ( a ) to extend the regions of applicability and judge the performance of it on the shos , ( b ) to calculate accurately the bound - state spectra of these systems .",
    "comparison with the literature data has been made wherever possible .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows .",
    "section ii presents an overview of the basic formalism .",
    "section iii makes a discussion of the results while a few concluding remarks are made in section iv .",
    "in this section , we present the gps formalism used to solve the radial eigenvalue problem with the sho potentials .",
    "a detailed account of the gps method can be found in the references [ 25 - 29 ] .",
    "the time - independent radial schrdinger equation to be solved can be written in the usual way ( atomic units employed unless otherwise mentioned ) , @xmath15 \\psi_{n,\\ell}(\\mathrm{r})=e_{n,\\ell}\\ \\psi_{n,\\ell}(\\mathrm{r})\\ ] ] where v(r ) is the sho potential given by , @xmath16/2.\\ ] ] the 1/2 factor is introduced here only for easy comparison with the literature and @xmath12 signifies the usual angular momentum quantum number .",
    "the gps formalism facilitates the use of a denser mesh at small r regions and a relatively coarser mesh at the large r regions while preserving the similar accuracy at both the regions .",
    "the key step in this formalism is to approximate a function @xmath17 defined in the interval @xmath18 $ ] by an n - th order polynomial @xmath19 _ exactly _ at the discrete collocation points @xmath20 as in the following , @xmath21 @xmath22 within the legendre pseudospectral method that the current work uses , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 can be determined from the roots of the first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath26 with respect to @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 the @xmath29s in eq .",
    "( 4 ) are the cardinal functions expressed as , @xmath30 satisfying the relation @xmath31 . at this stage",
    ", we use a transformation @xmath32 to map the semi - infinite domain @xmath33 $ ] onto the finite domain @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "one can make use of the following algebraic nonlinear mapping , @xmath34 where l and @xmath35 are the mapping parameters",
    ". finally introduction of the following relation , @xmath36 in conjunction with a symmetrization procedure gives the following transformed hamiltonian @xmath37 the advantage of this is that one ends up with a _",
    "matrix eigenvalue problem which can be solved readily and efficiently to give accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by using standard routines .",

    "thorough checks are made on the variation of the energies with respect to the mapping parameters for large ranges of the interaction parameters in the potential available in the literature .",
    "after a series of such calculations , a choice has been made at the point where the results changed negligibly with any variation . in this way , a consistent and uniform set of parameters ( @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) has been used .",
    "before considering the general case of relatively stronger spikes , _ viz . , _",
    "@xmath46 , it is worthwhile to study the simpler special case of @xmath45 .",
    "this does not exhibit supersingularity and the hamiltonian takes the simplified confined coulomb potential type form .",
    "it has been pointed out [ 31 ] that this possesses an infinite set of _ elementary _ solutions .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] displays such elementary solutions calculated by the present method along with the exact analytical results .",
    "note that @xmath47 is a trivial solution corresponding to @xmath48 , i.e. , the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the other @xmath3s in this table are taken from the solutions of the polynomial equation [ 31 ] .",
    "it may be noted that all the calculated results in this table and throughout the article are _ truncated _ and therefore all the digits in the reported numbers should be considered as correct .",
    "it is seen that for all values of @xmath3 , our results match excellently up to a 12 digit accuracy with the exact values .",
