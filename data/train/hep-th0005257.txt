    "when calculating the ground state energy of a quantum field ( the casimir energy ) the main problem is to single out a finite part of the vacuum energy which is initially divergent .",
    "usually for this purpose a subtraction procedure is used with preliminary regularization of the divergent expressions ( for example , by introducing ultraviolet cutoff ) .",
    "however in quantum field theory treated with allowance for nontrivial boundary conditions or in the space - time with curvature , a complete renormalization procedure is not formulated explicitly . therefore , for any specific problem",
    "the subtraction procedure should be invented anew . as a result ,",
    "one succeeds in calculating the casimir energy only in the problems with known spectra or at least implicitly known spectra .",
    "practically it implies the boundary conditions of high symmetry  @xcite ( parallel plates , sphere , cylinder ) .    in studies of the casimir energy",
    "it is wildly used the zeta function technique  @xcite which is also referred to as the zeta regularization or zeta renormalization .",
    "in fact , the use of the zeta functions , as well as other regularizations , gives only regularized quantities for ground state energy , for effective potential and so on .",
    "the necessity to renormalize the expressions obtained in this way certainly remains .",
    "however , in some problems the zeta technique gives at once a finite result .",
    "usually the latter is considered to be a renormalized physical answer though generally it is not the case.@xcite    when using the zeta regularization in one or another problem , it is desirable to know beforehand whether the finite result can be obtained in this way . in order to answer this question the general analysis of the divergences in the problem at hand should be accomplished .",
    "this can be done by calculating the heat kernel coefficients@xcite depending on the geometry of the manifold under consideration . for a large class of situations",
    "these coefficients have been obtained.@xcite however there is a number of problems ( for example , boundaries with edges or corners ) for which no general results regarding the heat trace are known .",
    "in this situation it is undoubtedly worth carrying out , in the framework of the zeta function technique , the calculations of the casimir energy for new configurations , both the cases being interesting with finite result and with pole contributions left in the final expression for the vacuum energy .    in the present paper",
    "we address the calculation of the casimir energy for boundaries with edges , more precisely , the vacuum energy of electromagnetic field will be calculated for a semi - circular cylindrical shell by making use of the relevant zeta functions .",
    "this shell is obtained by crossing an infinite circular cylindrical shell by a plane passing through the symmetry axes of the cylinder .",
    "all the surfaces , including the infinite cutting plane , are assumed to be perfectly conducting .",
    "obviously it is sufficient to consider only a half of this configuration ( left or right ) which we shall refer to as a semi - circular cylindrical shell or , for sake of shortening , as a semi - circular cylinder .",
    "the internal boundary value problem for this configuration is nothing else as a semi - cylindrical waveguide . in the theory of",
    "waveguides@xcite it is well known that a semi - circular waveguide has the same eigenfrequencies as the cylindrical one but without degeneracy ( without doubling ) and safe for one frequency series ( see below ) . notwithstanding the very close spectra , the zeta function technique does not give a finite result for a semi - circular cylinder unlike for a circular one .",
    "first the casimir energy of an infinite perfectly conducting cylindrical shell has been calculated in ref . by introducing ultraviolet cutoff and recently this result",
    "was derived by zeta function technique@xcite ( see also refs . ) . as far as we know the asymmetric boundaries such as a semi - circular cylinder have not been considered in the casimir problem .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the electromagnetic spectra are considered in details for cylindrical and semi - cylindrical shells .",
    "the general solution of the maxwell equations for boundary conditions chosen is expressed in terms of two scalar functions , longitudinal components of the electric and magnetic hertz vectors .",
    "these scalar functions are the eigenfunctions of the two - dimensional transverse laplace operator and obey the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on the conducting surfaces . in sec .",
    "iii the spectral zeta function is constructed for the dirichlet boundary value problem . to this end , the technique is used which has been elaborated before for representing the spectral zeta function , with given eigenfrequency equations , in terms of contour integral . when carrying out the analytic continuation of the zeta function into the physical region , the uniform asymptotic expansion for the modified bessel functions is used . in the same way , in sec .",
    "iv the zeta function is constructed for a scalar field obeying the neumann boundary conditions given on the surface of a semi - circular cylindrical shell .",
    "the section v is concerned with the complete zeta function for electromagnetic field with boundary conditions on the semi - circular cylinder .",
    "transition to the relevant two - dimensional problem is also considered here . in the conclusion ( sec .",
    "vi ) the results obtained are summarized , and the origin of the pole singularities of the zeta functions at hand and their relation to the respective boundary value problem are briefly discussed .",
    "the construction of the solutions to the maxwell equations with boundary conditions given on closed surfaces proves to be nontrivial problem .",
    "mainly it is due to the vector character of the electromagnetic field @xcite . in the case of cylindrical symmetry",
    "the electric @xmath0 and magnetic @xmath1 fields are expressed in terms of the electric ( @xmath2 ) and magnetic ( @xmath3 ) hertz vectors having only one non - zero component @xmath4 here the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath5 is used with @xmath6 axes directed along the cylinder axes . the common time ",
    "dependent factor @xmath7 is dropped .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the eigenfunctions of the two  dimensional transverse laplace operator and meet , respectively , the dirichlet and neumann conditions on the boundary @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the transverse part of the laplace operator @xmath14 and @xmath15    first we consider a cylindrical shell . in this case the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 should be @xmath16-periodic in angular variable @xmath17 . as a result the dirichlet boundary value problem ( [ d ] ) has the following unnormalized eigenfunctions ( @xmath18-modes ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cylinder radius , @xmath21 are the bessel functions , @xmath22 are the hankel functions of the first kind , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 stand for the roots of the frequency equations @xmath25    for the neumann boundary value problem ( [ n ] ) we have the @xmath26-modes @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the roots of the equations @xmath30 as usual , it is assumed that for @xmath31 the eigenfunctions should satisfy the radiation condition .",
    "it is important to note that each root @xmath32 is doubly degenerate since , according to eqs .",
    "( [ efd ] ) , ( [ efn ] ) , there are two eigenfunctions which are proportional to either @xmath33 or @xmath34 . the frequencies with @xmath35 @xmath36 are independent on @xmath17 , and",
    "the degeneracy disappears .    for given hertz vectors",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 the electric and magnetic fields are constructed by the formulas @xmath39 it has been proved @xcite that the superposition of these modes gives the general solution to the maxwell equations in the problem under consideration .",
    "an essential merit of using the hertz polarization vectors is that in this approach the necessity to satisfy the gauge conditions does not arise .",
    "let us consider a waveguide which is obtained by cutting the infinite cylindrical shell by a plane passing through the symmetry axes of the cylinder ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "all the surfaces are assumed to be perfectly conducting . in this case",
    "the boundary value problems ( [ d ] ) and ( [ n ] ) for the hertz electric ( @xmath37 ) and magnetic ( @xmath38 ) vectors have the following eigenfunctions @xmath40 and @xmath41 the frequencies @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath29 are determined by the same equations ( [ fed ] ) and ( [ fen ] ) .",
    "however the new spectral problem has two essential distinctions : i ) the frequencies ( [ dr ] ) are now nondegenerate , and ii ) two series of eigenfrequencies @xmath45 are absent . at first sight",
    "one could expect that such a change of the spectrum can not influence drastically on the ultraviolet behaviour of the relevant spectral density .",
    "however , as it will be shown below , the zeta function for a semi - circular cylinder , unlike for a circular one , does not provide a finite answer for the casimir energy in the problem in question .    in view of all",
    "above - mentioned the zeta function for electromagnetic field obeying the boundary conditions on the surface of the semi - circular cylinder is the sum of two zeta functions for scalar massless fields satisfying the dirichlet and neumann conditions on the lateral of this cylinder .",
    "first we consider the dirichlet boundary conditions",
    ". we shall proceed from the following representation for the zeta function in terms of a contour integral for given frequency equations ( [ fed ] ) with @xmath46 @xmath47 the contour @xmath48 consists of the imaginary axis @xmath49 and a semi - circle of an infinite radius in the right half - plane of a complex variable @xmath50 .",

    "it is essential that for the zeta functions @xmath150 the exact formulas are derived which determine these functions in a finite region of the complex variable @xmath65 but not at the vicinity of one point @xmath54 .",
    "this allowed one to get in a straightforward way the zeta functions for the two dimensional ( plane ) version of the boundary value problem at hand , i.e. the zeta functions for scalar fields defined on a half - plane and obeying the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on a semi - circle . in this case",
    "the final expression for the vacuum energy contains the pole contributions also .",
    "notwithstanding the spectrum of a semi - circular cylinder is very close to the spectrum of circular one , the zeta function technique does not give a finite value for vacuum energy in the first case and does for the second configuration .",
    "in a recent paper@xcite the divergences found in our consideration are attributed to the existence of edges or corners in the boundaries under investigation .",
