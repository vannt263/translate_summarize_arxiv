    "does a gravitational collapse always lead to formation of a black hole ? what kind of black holes can exist in nature ? can realistic black holes be well described by stationary solutions ?",
    "these are among the most important problems in general relativity and have been studied for long time . although we do not have a definite answer to the first question related to the cosmic censorship yet , we have rather well established answers to the second and third questions , which are summarised as the uniqueness and stability of asymptotically flat stationary regular black hole solutions .    in local astrophysical problems in the present universe , the assumption of the asymptotic flatness will be a good approximation .",
    "however , the success of the inflationary universe model implies that the cosmological constant can not be neglected even locally in the early universe .",
    "further , recent developments in unifying theories suggest the possibility that the universe has dimensions higher than four on microscopic scales and that mini black holes might be produced in elementary particle processes in colliders as well as in high energy cosmic shower events . therefore , it is a quite important problem whether the uniqueness and stability of regular black hole solutions also hold in the non - vanishing cosmological constant case and/or in higher dimensions .    in this article",
    ", we briefly overview the present status of the investigations of this problem and discuss what kind of new information can be obtained by the linear perturbation theory .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , we now have an almost complete list of regular stationary black hole solutions for the asymptotically flat einstein - maxwell system ( for historical references , see the reviews refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    what has played",
    "the most important role in this classification problem is the rigidity theorem , which asserts that for the einstein - maxwell system , an asymptotically flat stationary regular analytic black hole solution whose horizon is an analytic submanifold is axisymmetric if it is rotating , i.e. , the killing vector that represents the time translation at infinity is not parallel to the null generators on the horizon@xcite .",
    "the first full proof of this theorem was given in the textbook by hawking and ellis under the assumption that the horizon is connected and non - degenerate , i.e. , the surface gravity of the horizon does not vanish .",
    "incompleteness of their proof concerning the claims that the domain of outer communication is simply connected and the black hole surface has @xmath0 topology was later removed by chruciel and wald .",
    "further , the theorem was extended by chruciel@xcite to include the case in which the horizon has multiple components and/or is degenerate . at about the same time",
    ", it was proved by rcz and wald that a non - rotating regular black hole solution is static if the horizon is non - degenerate .",
    "thus , the classification problem of asymptotically flat stationary ( regular analytic ) black hole solutions was reduced to that of static black holes and axisymmetric black holes . for neutral static black holes and",
    "charged static black holes with non - degenerate horizon , this classification problem is completely solved : the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solution are the only regular black hole solutions , as is well - known . in contrast ,",
    "in the charged degenerate case , there exists in addition the family of the majumdar - papapetrou multiple black hole solutions , which was recently shown to exhaust all regular solutions with multiple black holes if the charges of all black holes have the same sign@xcite .",
    "next , in the rotating case , the kerr - newman solution is the only asymptotically flat regular solution , if the horizon is connected .",
    "concerning multiple black hole solutions , weinstein classified solutions that are regular except on the symmetry axis and found that for any positive integer @xmath1 , there exist families of @xmath1 black hole solutions , with parallel spins aligned on the symmetry axis , which has @xmath2 parameters for the vacuum case@xcite and @xmath3 parameters for the electro - vacuum case@xcite . at present , it is not known whether these families contains a completely regular solution without a strut singularity .",
    "uniqueness theorems are also proved for some asymptotically flat systems with other types of matter .",
    "for example , the only regular static black hole solutions with non - degenerate horizon are given by the gibbons - maeda solutions for the einstein - maxwell - dilaton system , and by the reissner - nordstrm solution for the einstein - maxwell - dirac system .",
    "further , it is also shown that the only regular stationary black hole solutions with non - degenerate horizon is the kerr solution when the matter is described by a harmonic scalar@xcite .",
    "note that in this result , the rigidity theorem is assumed for the rotating case .",
    "in the meantime , it is now known that the uniqueness theorem is not universal and does not hold for some systems .",
    "for example , for the einstein - yang - mills system , it is shown that there exist a family of spherically symmetric regular soliton solutions and regular black hole solutions different from schwarzschild solutions .",
    "although these additional solutions are shown to be unstable , the einstein - skyrme system allows of a spherically symmetric regular black hole solution with a skyrme hair that is stable .",
    "the investigation of the classification of black hole solutions had been mainly concerned with the asymptotically flat case for a long time .",
    "this was because basic tools used to prove the uniqueness theorems for the asymptotically flat case do not work for systems with non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "recently , however , anderson has worked out a new approach which leads to a new type of rigidity theorem and enables us to study the classification problem of static spacetimes with negative cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "utilising this approach , anderson , chruciel and delay showed that an asymptotically anti - de sitter and static vacuum solution containing one non - degenerate regular black hole is unique and given by the schwarzschild - ads black hole solution if it has a @xmath4 conformal spatial completion .",
    "unfortunately , their method can not be applied to the rotating case or to the case of positive cosmological constant .",
    "as far as the author knows , no uniqueness theorem with sufficient generality has been proved in the case of positive cosmological constant .",
    "later , we will show that in a perturbative sense , the uniqueness of black hole solutions can be proved even for this positive cosmological constant case .",
    "the uniqueness of black holes does not necessarily imply their stability .",
    "in particular , if the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) does not hold , a regular stationary black hole solution will be unstable against a generic perturbation , because formation of naked singularity must be generic@xcite .",
    "in reality , many of the standard black hole solutions are known to be perturbatively stable , supporting cch . for example , both schwarzschild black holes and non - degenerate reissner - nordstrm black holes are proved to be stable .",
    "recently , the kottler black holes , i.e. , the spherically symmetric black holes in spacetimes with non - vanishing cosmological constant , were also shown to be stable by the author and ishibashi .",
    "in contrast to static black holes , the stability of rotating black holes are established only for the kerr black holes@xcite .",
    "we do not discuss the stability of these rotating black holes in this article .    in the proofs of the stability of these black holes , a key role",
    "was played by the fact that the basic equations for perturbations can be reduced to a single second - order ode ( ordinary differential equation ) of the schrdinger type , which is often called a master equation .",
    "now , we explain how such a master equation is derived and how the stability is proved in terms of it .      in spacetimes of dimension",
    "@xmath5 , the linearisation of the einstein equations yields the following equations for the metric perturbation @xmath6 : where @xmath7 is the lichinerowicz operator defined by in order to analyse the behaviour of perturbations on the basis of these equations , the following two technical problems have to be resolved .",
    "firstly , the perturbation variables @xmath8 contain unphysical gauge degrees of freedom that should be eliminated .",
    "second , these perturbation equations are a coupled system of a large number of equations and are quite hard to solve directly .    in the case of our interest in which the unperturbed background spacetime is spherically symmetric , these problems can be resolved with the help of the tensorial decomposition and the gauge - invariant formulation .",
    "first , the metric of a spherically symmetric black hole solution to the vacuum or electro - vacuum system in @xmath5 dimensions is written as where @xmath9 is the metric of a two - dimensional orbit space @xmath10 , which can be written as @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the metric of the unit sphere @xmath13 . on this background",
    ", the basic perturbation variables @xmath8 can be grouped into three sets , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , according to their tensorial transformation behaviour on @xmath13 . among these",
    ", @xmath15 can be further decomposed into the gradient part @xmath17 and the divergence - free part @xmath18 as where @xmath19 is the covariant derivative with respective to the metric @xmath20 on @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 can be decomposed into the trace part and trace - free part as and the trace - free part @xmath21 can be further decomposed into the scalar part @xmath22 , the divergence - free vector part @xmath23 and the divergence - free and trace - free part @xmath24 as by this decomposition , the linearised einstein equations are decomposed into three decoupled sets of equations , each of which contains only variables belonging to one of the three sets of variables , the scalar - type variables @xmath25 , vector - type variables @xmath26 , and tensor - type variables @xmath27 .",
    "further , since the covariant derivative @xmath19 always appears in the combination @xmath28 in the perturbation equations due to spherical symmetry , the expansion coefficients of these variables in terms of harmonic tensors on @xmath13 , which are denoted as @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the scalar - type , vector - type and tensor - type variables , respectively , are mutually coupled among only those corresponding to the same harmonic tensor ( see ref . for details of this harmonic expansion ) .",
    "thus , the perturbation equations can be reduced to sets of equations on the two - dimensional orbit space @xmath10 with small number of entries independent of the spacetime dimension .",
    "in addition , after this harmonic expansion , we can easily construct a basis for gauge - invariant variables by taking appropriate linear combinations of these two - dimensional variables and their derivatives with respect to the coordinates @xmath32 of @xmath10 , and the linearised einstein equations can be written as differential equations for these gauge - invariant variables .",
    "thus , we can essentially resolve the two technical problems mentioned at the beginning of this subsection .      by applying the above arguments to four - dimensional spherically symmetric black holes , we obtain two decoupled sets of equations for the scalar - type and vector - type perturbations , which are often called the even modes ( or the polar perturbation ) and the odd modes ( or the axial perturbation ) , respectively .",
    "the tensor - type perturbation does not exist because there is no trace - free and divergence - free symmetric tensor on @xmath0 .",
    "since the background is static , by the fourier transformation with respect to the time coordinate @xmath33 , these equations can be further reduced to sets of odes for functions of @xmath34 .    for the vector - type perturbation in the schwarzschild background with @xmath35 ,",
    "the corresponding set of equations can be easily reduced to a single second - order ode of the shcrdinger type , as first shown by regge and wheeler .",
    "it was shown by zerilli later that a similar reduction is possible for the scalar - type perturbation of the schwarzschild black hole as well@xcite .",
    "although these authors derived these master equations by the gauge - fixing method , the master variable @xmath36 can be written in terms of gauge - invariant variables .",
    "thus , the linear stability of the schwarzschild black hole is determined by the behaviour of the effective potential @xmath37 for each mode .",
    "the explicit expressions for the effective potentials are given by for the vector perturbation and for the scalar perturbation .",
    "here , @xmath38 is written in terms of the eigenvalue of the harmonic scalar @xmath39 as @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to see that the effective potentials @xmath43 and @xmath44 are positive outside the horizon @xmath45 .",
    "because @xmath46 runs in the range @xmath47 , this implies that the master equation for @xmath36 has no regular and normalizable solution for @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the 4d schwarzschild black hole is perturbatively stable@xcite .      for charged static black holes , metric perturbations couple perturbations of electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , by taking appropriate combinations of perturbation variables , the perturbation equations for each type can be reduced to two decoupled odes as where @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the electromagnetic and gravitational modes , respectively@xcite .",
    "the effective potentials @xmath51 can be shown to be positive outside the horizon .",
    "hence , the reissner - nordstm black hole is perturbatively stable outside the ( outer killing ) horizon , although it is unstable even against spherically symmetric perturbations inside the outer horizon ( mass inflation ) .",
    "recently , cardoso and lemos found that the perturbation equations for 4d schwarzschild - ds and -ads black holes can be also reduced to a single master equation of the schrdinger type(see also ref . ) .",
    "first , the effective potential for the scalar perturbation is given by where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and clearly , @xmath44 is positive definite outside the horizon ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "hence , there exists no normalizable mode with @xmath48 .",
    "next , the effective potential for the vector perturbation is given by this effective potential is positive definite outside the horizon for @xmath55 . however , for @xmath56 it becomes negative in a neighbourhood of the horizon if @xmath57 is large .",
    "nevertheless , we can show that there exists no normalizable @xmath48 mode for vector perturbations as well .",
    "one way to show this is to utilise the scalar - vector correspondence explained next .",
    "solutions @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the same frequency @xmath60 to two odes of the schrdinger equation type are related by where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are functions of @xmath34 that do not depend on @xmath60 , if and only if the effective potentials @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the two equations are expressed in terms of a single function @xmath65 as for some constant @xmath66 .",
    "such functions exist for the regge - wheeler and zerilli potentials .",
    "this scalar - vector correspondence also holds for the schwarzschild - ds and -ads black holes .",
    "hence , we can conclude that there exists no normalizable vector perturbation with @xmath48 from the above result for scalar perturbations .",
    "we can obtain some information about the uniqueness problem of black holes by the perturbation analysis .",
    "this is because there must exist a bounded regular solution with @xmath67 to the perturbation equations if there were a continuous family of stationary regular black hole solutions that contains a spherically symmetric solution .",
    "for example , by a method called _ @xmath68-deformation _ , which is explained later , we can show that there exists no bounded regular solution with @xmath69 outside the horizon for neutral as well as charged spherically symmetric static black holes , except for stationary vector perturbations with @xmath70 .",
    "these stationary solutions can be parametrised by three parameters that can be interpreted as the angular momentum of perturbations .",
    "hence , we can conclude that 4d asymptotically ds or ads static regular black hole solutions are unique in a perturbative sense under the conditions that the spacetime is static and contains a single black hole .",
    "this argument also suggests that the extensions of the kerr solution to the non - vanishing cosmological constant case , which are described by the neutral carter solutions with vanishing nut parameter@xcite , are the only asymptotically ds or ads stationary regular solutions with a connected horizon , in a vicinity of their static and spherically symmetric limit .",
    "it is quite easy to find the higher - dimensional counter - parts of 4d spherically symmetric black holes , such as the tangherlini - schwarzschild solution@xcite . in reality , it is also possible to find slightly more general family of solutions for the einstein - maxwell system with cosmological constant @xmath71 by requiring that the spacetime metric and the electromagnetic tensor @xmath72 can be expressed in the form where @xmath9 is a metric of a two - dimensional space @xmath10 , and @xmath73 is a metric of an einstein space @xmath74 satisfying with @xmath75 .",
    "the einstein equations and maxwell equations determine the two - dimensional metric @xmath76 and the electric field @xmath77 as where in the special case in which @xmath74 is the unit sphere @xmath13 , the spacetime becomes static and spherically symmetric .",
    "in particular , for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , this solution coincides with the tangherlini - schwarzschild solution , and for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , it gives an higher - dimensional counter - part of the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "more generally , when @xmath74 is a constant curvature space , the solution is invariant under @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 , respectively .            in general , this solution have a naked singularity or does not have a horizon . as shown in ref .",
    ", it gives a regular black hole spacetime only when the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 are in the special regions depicted in fig.[fig : bhcondition ] . in this case",
    ", the einstein space @xmath74 describes a spatial section of the black hole horizon and at the same time the spatial infinity .      in the static case with @xmath81 , the uniqueness of asymptotically flat regular black holes",
    "is now established in higher dimensions as well : all regular solutions are exhausted by the tangherlini - schwarzschild solution for the vacuum system and by the higher - dimensional reissner - norsdtrm solution given by and with @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the non - degenerate case and the higher - dimensional majumdar - papapetrou solutions in the degenerate case for the einstein - maxwell system@xcite .",
    "further , it is also proved that the gibbons - maeda solution and the tangherlini - schwarzschild solution are the only asymptotically flat regular black hole solutions for the einstein - maxwell - dilaton system and for the einstein - harmonic - scalar system , respectively . however , for @xmath88 , nothing is known about the uniqueness , although it was pointed out in ref . that the approach developed by anderson may also apply to higher - dimensional cases with @xmath89 .    in the rotating case , the higher - dimensional counter - part of the kerr solution is also known .",
    "it is given by the myers - perry solution , which has a spherical horizon and is asymptotically flat .",
    "in contrast to the static case , however , this is not the unique asymptotically flat rotating regular solutions in higher dimensions , although the uniqueness holds for supersymmetric black holes in the 5-dimensional @xmath90 minimal supergravity model@xcite .",
    "this is because the horizon topology need not be given by the sphere in higher - dimensions as discussed in ref . .",
    "in fact , emparan and reall found an asymptotically flat and rotating regular black hole solution in five dimensions whose black hole surface is homeomorphic to @xmath91 .",
    "thus , at present , we have two different families of asymptotically flat rotating regular solutions with different horizon topologies . since more complicated horizon topology is allowed in dimensions greater than 5 , it is highly probable that other families of regular solutions exist .",
    "however , near the static and spherically symmetric limit , it is likely that a uniqueness theorem holds , as we will see later .",
    "recently , the author and ishibashi have shown that for a static charge black hole in higher dimensions represented by and , perturbation equations can be also reduced to decoupled 2nd - order master equations of the schrdinger type , as in four dimensions .",
    "these master equations in higher dimensions , however , have some new features .",
    "first , the effective potential @xmath92 is not positive definite in general .",
    "hence , there may exist an unstable mode .",
    "second , there exists no simple relation between vector and scalar perturbations like the scalar - vector correspondence in four dimensions , for @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that stabilities for scalar and vector perturbations should be studied separately .",
    "third , there exist tensor perturbations for @xmath93 .",
    "now , let us see how these new features affect the stability of static black holes in higher dimensions .",
    "when @xmath74 is a generic einstein space , the @xmath74-coordinates appear in perturbation equations only through the lichnerowicz operator hence , by expanding tensor perturbations in terms of the eigentensors of @xmath94 , we obtain a single decoupled equation for @xmath31 , which can be easily put into the form .    in the special case",
    "in which @xmath74 is a constant curvature space , @xmath95 is expressed as @xmath96 .",
    "hence , the expansion by @xmath97 is identical to harmonic expansion , and the eigenvalue @xmath98 is related to the eigenvalue @xmath99 with respect to @xmath100 by @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath99 is always non - negative and takes the discrete value @xmath102 for @xmath103 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "for neutral black holes , the effective potential for tensor perturbations reads when @xmath74 is maximally symmetric , @xmath104 outside the horizon since @xmath105 .",
    "hence , the black hole is stable for a tensor perturbation .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath74 is a generic einstein space , no general lower bound for @xmath106 is known , and generalised static black holes can be unstable against a tensor perturbation .",
    "next for charged black holes , since em field perturbations are not coupled to tensor perturbations of the metric , the master equation is again given by a single equation .",
    "the effective potential is given by we can show that this potential is positive definite outside the horizon if @xmath107 .",
    "hence , when @xmath74 is maximally symmetric , the black hole is stable against tensor perturbations for @xmath108 .",
    "however , for @xmath109 ( @xmath56 ) , the potential becomes negative near the horizon if @xmath87 is close to the lower limit @xmath110 in fig.[fig : bhcondition ] .",
    "hence , the black hole might be unstable in this case even when @xmath74 is maximally symmetric .      for scalar and vector perturbations",
    ", we can expand perturbation variables by scalar harmonics @xmath111 and vector harmonics @xmath112 on @xmath74 satisfying @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "for each harmonic , there appear two modes of perturbations , an electromagnetic mode @xmath49 and a gravitational mode @xmath50 .",
    "they obey two decoupled equations of the form , as in the case of 4d reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "however , @xmath51 is not positive definite when @xmath115 is large , even for spherically symmetric black hole . in order to study the stability for such a system",
    ", we utilised the following method that we call _ the @xmath68-deformation method_.    let @xmath116 be the range of @xmath46 corresponding to the regular region outside of the horizon , @xmath117 . here",
    ", @xmath118 is @xmath119 for @xmath55 , but is finite for @xmath56 .",
    "then , in the space @xmath120 of smooth functions with compact support , the operator is symmetric .",
    "we assume that @xmath121 is extended to a self - adjoint operator in @xmath122 by the friedrichs extension .",
    "then , the lower bound for the spectrum of @xmath121 coincides with the lower bound of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) . here , for any regular function @xmath125 on @xmath116",
    ", we have where hence , if we can show that @xmath126 is non - negative for an appropriate @xmath68 , we can conclude that @xmath127 , i.e. , the stability of the system .     for @xmath79.,height=188 ]     for @xmath79.,height=188 ]      the effective potentials for vector perturbations are given by where these potentials are not positive definite when @xmath115 is large as illustrated in fig.[fig : v_v ] .",
    "nevertheless , we can show that there exists no unstable mode for most cases , by using the @xmath68-deformation method .",
    "in fact , for @xmath128 , the @xmath68-deformation yields where @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath130 , @xmath131 is positive definite .",
    "hence , the em mode of a vector perturbation is always stable .",
    "further , for @xmath108 , we can also show that @xmath132 is positive definite .",
    "hence , we can conclude that black holes with @xmath108 are stable against vector perturbations .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath109 ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath132 becomes negative near the horizon when @xmath87 is close to the critical value @xmath110 .",
    "in this case , we can not prove the stability by this method .",
    ", width=151 ]    , width=188 ]      the explicit expressions of the effective potentials @xmath133 for scalar perturbations are quite long .",
    "so , we only give the graphs of them for some special parameter values in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_s ] . as these figures show , either of @xmath134 and @xmath135 is not positive definite in general .",
    "however , by the @xmath68-deformation method again , we can show that the black hole is always stable for the em mode perturbation .",
    "we can also show that asymptotically flat neutral black holes in arbitrary dimensions and asymptotically ds and ads neutral black holes in four dimensions are stable .",
    "however , the stability of charged black holes has been proved only for special cases .",
    "the present status of the perturbative analysis of generalised static black holes is summarised in table [ tbl : stability ] .",
    ".stability of generalised static black holes [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as explained in  [ perturbativeuniqueness:4d ]",
    ", we can study the perturbative uniqueness of black holes near the static limit by looking for bounded stationary solutions to the perturbation equations .",
    "actually , we can establish a kind of perturbative uniqueness theorem by this approach .",
    "for the limitation of space , we only give an outline of the argument here .",
    "the detail will be given in another paper@xcite .",
    "first of all , note that there exist such solutions with @xmath70 for the vector perturbation equation in the spherically symmetric case ( @xmath80 ) as shown in ref .. to be precise , vector harmonics on @xmath13 are in one - to - one correspondence to killing vectors of @xmath13 , and for each harmonic there exists one stationary solution to the vector perturbation equation . a killing vector on @xmath13 is further in one - to - one correspondence to an antisymmetric matrix of rank @xmath136 , and the conjugate class of this matrix is classified by its @xmath1 eigenvalues , where @xmath137 $ ] is the rank of @xmath82 .",
    "hence , these stationary solutions exactly correspond to the angular momentum freedom of the myers - perry solution .    in the asymptotically flat case",
    ", we can show that there exists no other stationary solution for which @xmath138 are bounded everywhere .",
    "hence , the myers - perry solution is the unique regular solution near the static limit . in the asymptotically de sitter case",
    ", we can obtain the same result for the tensor and vector perturbations by using the s - deformation technique . the perturbative uniqueness for the scalar perturbation",
    "can also be proved in arbitrary dimensions by applying a similar argument to a master equation that holds only for stationary perturbations .",
    "in contrast , the asymptotically anti - de sitter case is more subtle . in this case , there exist infinitely many solutions with bounded @xmath138 in addition to the @xmath70 vector perturbations , in accordance with the general result in the four dimensional case .",
    "however , if we require the stronger but natural asymptotic condition that every component of the metric perturbation with respect to an background orthonormal basis vanishes at @xmath139 , these extra solutions are excluded .",
    "in this article , we have overviewed the present status of the uniqueness and stability issue of black holes in four and higher dimensions .",
    "we have seen that the uniqueness and stability are well established for asymptotically flat neutral and static black holes in arbitrary dimensions and for asymptotically flat stationary black holes in four dimensions , but the situation concerning the other cases is quite unsatisfactory . in particular , the classification and stability analysis of rotating black holes and asymptotically de sitter or anti - de sitter black holes in higher dimensions are important open problems , although the perturbative analysis can give some useful information as we have shown . in order to solve these problems in the nonperturbative framework , it will be necessary to find a higher - dimensional extension of the rigidity theorem .",
