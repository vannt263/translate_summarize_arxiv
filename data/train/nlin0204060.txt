    "controlling chaos , or stabilization of instable periodic orbits of chaotic systems , has matured to a field of large interest in theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "most of these techniques are applied to dissipative systems , but with respect to applications as suppression of transport in plasmas , there has been recent interest also in controlling chaos in hamiltonian systems @xcite and in the stability of periodic orbits in multidimensional systems @xcite .",
    "control of chaos in general , however , does not rely on the existence of a hamiltonian , so the system can be given as any dynamical system described by a set of differential equations , or can be an experimental system .",
    "the aim of chaos control is the stabilization of unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) , or modes in spatial systems .",
    "the central idea of the hbler and ott - grebogi - yorke approaches to the control of chaos is to utilize the sensitive dependence on initial conditions , be it _ system variables _",
    "@xcite , or _ system parameters _ @xcite to steer the trajectory on an ( otherwise unstable ) periodic orbit of the system . to accomplish this task ,",
    "a feedback is applied to the system at each crossing of a suitably chosen poincar plane , where the feedback is set proportional to the actual deviation of the desired trajectory .",
    "contrary to pyragas control @xcite , where control is calculated quasi continuously at a high sampling rate , here the approach is to stabilize by a feedback calculated at each poincar section , which reduces the control problem to stabilization of an unstable fixed point of an iterated map .",
    "the feedback can be chosen proportional to the distance to the desired fixed point ( ogy scheme ) , or proportional to the _ difference _ in phase space position between actual and last but one poincar section .",
    "this latter method , _ difference control _ @xcite , or bielawski - derozier - glorieux control , being a time - discrete counterpart of the pyragas approach @xcite , allows for stabilization of inaccurately known fixed points , and can be extended by a memory term @xcite to improve stability and to allow for tracking @xcite of drifting fixed points @xcite .    in this paper the stability of perturbations @xmath0 around an unstable periodic orbit being subject to a poincar - based control scheme is analyzed by means of floquet theory @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to investigate viewpoints that have not been accessible by considering only the iteration dynamics between the poincar sections , as measurement delays and variable impulse lengths .",
    "the impulse length is , both in ogy and difference control , usually a fixed ( quasi invisible ) parameter ; and the iterated dynamics is uniquely definded only as long as this impulse length is not varied .",
    "the influence of the impulse length has not been point of consideration before ; if mentioned at all , usually a relative length of approximately 1/3 is chosen without any reported sensitivity . whereas for the pyragas control method ( in which the delayed state feedback enforces a time - continuous description ) a floquet stability analysis is known @xcite , here the focus is on the time - discrete control .",
    "the linearized differential equations of both schemes are invariant under translation in time , @xmath1 .",
    "herby , we assume that the system under control is not explicitely time - dependent . according to the theory of delay - differential equations @xcite , a stability condition can be derived from a simple eigenvalue analysis of floquet modes .",
    "the floquet ansatz expands the solutions after periodic solutions @xmath2 according to @xmath3 the necessary condition on the floquet multiplier @xmath4 of an orbit of duration @xmath5 for stability of the solution is re@xmath6 ; and @xmath7 refers to motion along the orbit . in poincar - based control",
    "the effective motion can be transformed into the unstable eigenspace , see e.g.  app .",
    "a in @xcite ; the stability is governed by the motion therein . for the case of one unstable lyapunov exponent , this subspace is one - dimensional .",
    "the method proposed by ott , grebogi and yorke",
    "@xcite applies a control amplitude @xmath8 , in vicinity of a fixed point @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is a ( possibly time - dependent ) feedback gain parameter , and @xmath11 is the position of the last poincare crossing . without loss of generality , we can place the fixed point at @xmath12 , so that the ogy feedback scheme becomes @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the time of the last poincare crossing .",
    "now one considers the linearized motion in vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit ( which is a stable periodic orbit of a successfully controlled system ) .",
    "the poincar crossing reduces the dimensionality from @xmath15 to @xmath16 dimensions , in the lowest - dimensional case from 3 to 2 . in this case",
    "it is sufficient to consider a linearized one - dimensional time - continuous motion around the orbit , @xmath17 , which now can be complex - valued to account for flip motion around the orbit @xcite , i.e. , one has the dynamical system @xmath18 without control ( @xmath19 ) , the time evolution of this system is simply @xmath20 and the ljapunov exponent of the uncontrolled system is @xmath21 . here it must be emphasized that assuming constant @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a quite crude approximation , so only qualitative results can be concluded .",
    "now we see  a central observation  that no delay - differential equation @xcite is obtained : as the `` delay '' term always refers to the last poincar crossing , this type of dynamics can be integrated piecewise . in the first time interval between @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "the differential equation reads @xmath26 integration of this differential equation yields @xmath27 this gives us an iterated dynamics ( here we label the begin of the time period again with @xmath28 ) @xmath29 this equation allows to determine the floquet modes @xmath30 by inspection .",
    "the floquet multiplier @xmath4 of an orbit , assuming an impulse duration of full orbit length , therefore is given by @xmath31 the remainder of the paper investigates , both for ogy and difference control , how the floquet multiplier is modified for different impulse lengths .",
    "the time - discrete viewpoint now allows to investigate the influence of timing questions on control .",
    "first we consider the case that the control impulse is applied timely in the poincar section , but only for a finite period @xmath32 within the orbit period ( @xmath33 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ schemaps]a ) .",
    "this situation is described by the differential equation @xmath34 here @xmath35 is a step function ( @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 elsewhere ) . in the first time interval between @xmath24 and @xmath39",
    "the differential equation reads @xmath40 integration of this differential equation yields @xmath41 in the second interval between @xmath39 and @xmath25 the differential equation is the same as without control , @xmath42 from this one has immediately @xmath43 and the floquet multiplier of an orbit is given by @xmath44 the consequences are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : floq_ogyhyperbel2d ] .",
    "one finds that in zero order the `` strength '' of control is given by the product @xmath45 ; in fact there is a weak linear correction in @xmath46 .",
    "this analysis reproduces well the experimental results of mausbach @xcite . for @xmath47 one",
    "i.e.  the condition of a constant strength of control reads @xmath49 the result is : apart from a weak linear correction for ogy control the length of the impulse can be chosen arbitrarily , and the `` strength '' of control in zero order is given by the time integral over the control impulse .    for the case",
    "where the system can only be measured delayed  by a delay time of the orbit length and longer  stability borders @xcite and improved control schemes have been given in @xcite and successfully applied experimentally @xcite . in experimental situations",
    "one often has the intermediate case that there is a measurement delay @xmath50 that is not neglectable , but within the orbit length . to keep the case general",
    ", we again consider a finite impulse length @xmath32 with @xmath33 und @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "[ schemaps]b .",
    "again we can integrate piecewise , and the floquet multiplier is given by @xmath52 and ( [ eq : floquet_ogy_impulslaenge ] ) is included as the special case of @xmath53 .",
    "now we analyze the difference control scheme @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the times of last and last but one poincar crossing , respectively . again",
    "the starting point is the linearized equation of motion around the periodic orbit when control is applied . for difference control now there is a dependency on two past time steps , @xmath57 although the right hand side of ( [ eq : difkont_kont_dyn ] ) depends on @xmath58 at three different times , it can be nevertheless integrated exactly , which is mainly due to the fact that the two past times ( of the two last poincar crossings ) have a fixed time difference being equal to the orbit length .",
    "this allows not only for an exact solution , but also offers a correspondence to the time - discrete dynamics and the matrix picture used in time - delayed coordinates .",
    "now also for difference control the experimentally more common situation of a finite but small measurement delay @xmath50 is considered , together with a finite impulse length @xmath50 ( here @xmath33 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "an analogeous calculation @xcite as for the ogy case can also be performed as follows .",
    "piecewise integration in the first interval @xmath59 , where the differential equation reads @xmath60 , yields again @xmath61 . in the second interval @xmath62",
    "the differential equation reads @xmath63 integration yields @xmath64 for the third interval again there is no control , thus @xmath65 collecting together , we find for @xmath66 @xmath67 or , in time - delayed coordinates of the last and last but one poincar crossing @xmath68 if we identify with the coefficients of the time - discrete case , and @xmath69 , the dynamics in the poincar iteration @xmath70 becomes identical with the pure discrete description ; this again illustrates the power of the concept of the poincar map . in principle , due to the low degree of the characteristic polynomial , one could explicitely diagonalize the iteration matrix , allowing for a closed expression for the @xmath71-th power of the iteration matrix .",
    "however , for the stability analysis only the eigenvalues are needed . for the floquet multiplier",
    "one has @xmath72 this quadratic equation yields two floquet multipliers , @xmath73 figures [ fig : floq_diff_pre.eps ] and [ fig : floq_diffkont_keil.eps ] show , by example of re@xmath74 , ( resp .",
    "re@xmath75 ) that at im@xmath76 for @xmath77 ( resp @xmath78 ) there exists an island of stability , whose width decreases to zero for @xmath79 . here",
    "explicitely the influence of the impulse length can be seen . the maximal value of @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : floq_diffkont_pmax ] .",
    "the quantitative analysis given above was based on the model assumption that one has a constant local ljapunov exponent around the orbit  a condition that will almost never be fulfilled exactly for a typical orbit of a chaotic system . to test whether this assumption is crucial",
    ", the stability can be investigated for ogy control by assuming @xmath22 to be time - dependent along the orbit . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the exemplaric case shown in fig .",
    "[ schemael ] that @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 , generalizing the case @xmath85 already sketched in @xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath86 , we have for the ogy case , @xmath87 using @xmath88 , the floquet multiplier reads now @xmath89 in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ eq : floquet_ogy_impulslaenge ] ) .",
    "again in zero order the `` strength '' of control is given by the product @xmath90 ; in first order @xmath91 again the weak linear dependence on @xmath46 applies , @xmath92 i.e. for a constant `` strength '' of control , one has to fulfill @xmath93 thus , the value of @xmath94 , i.e.  here , the deviation of @xmath95 from its average value @xmath96 during the control impulse , only contributes in first order .",
    "more complicated cases can be tackled likewise , giving corrections for the quantitative @xmath46-dependence of the optimal control gain @xmath97 , but preserving the qualitative behaviour discussed above .      while a short impulse is the experimentally more feasible case , for completeness , also the @xmath98 shown in fig .",
    "[ schemaellong ] can be investigated in this manner .",
    "here we have two time intervals where the control is active ; and in the second one the initial condition @xmath99 has to be distinguished from the position @xmath100 at the last poincar crossing , from which the control value is calculated and which determines the inhomogenity of the ode .",
    "integration over the three time intervals yields @xmath101 so that we arrive at @xmath102.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      as @xmath98 , and @xmath103 is a fixed value for the given system , a discussion of @xmath104 can no longer be based on the @xmath105 case .",
    "as @xmath46 is of order 1 , an expansion as above is meaningful only for the case where @xmath106 , i.e. , we derive an approximation for those upos which have an only marginally positive floquet multiplier . for @xmath85",
    "we now explicitely discuss this `` weakly nonlinear '' case @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 \\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\nonumber & = & x(0 ) { \\rm{}e}^{\\bar{\\lambda}t } \\left[1-\\frac{\\mu\\varepsilon t}{2 } \\big(1-\\lambda_1 t ( p-\\frac{1}{4 } ) + o(\\lambda_1 ^ 2,\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 , \\lambda_2 ^ 2 ) \\big ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , control is kept constant in lowest order for @xmath110 for orbits sharing the same value of @xmath96 .      for completeness , now also the case of difference control is considered .",
    "as has been shown before , for the case of a constant ljapunov exponent , impulse lengths of @xmath111 do not lead to stable control ; therefore the case @xmath98 is completely irrelevant , and only the case @xmath86 has to be be considered . in the first interval",
    ", @xmath94 is active and integration yields @xmath112\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the subsequent intervals have the control switched off , @xmath113.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again we use the average value @xmath114 to simplify the expressions , and the coordinates in the poincar countings @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "we have @xmath118 which leads to the characteristic equation for the two floquet multipliers",
    "@xmath119 @xmath120 this generalizes the discussion of difference control to the case of nonconstant @xmath22 .",
    "to summarize , a new time - continuous stability analysis of poincar - based control methods was introduced .",
    "this general and novel approach allows to investigate timing questions of poincar based control schemes that can not be analyzed within the picture of the poincar iteration . for both ogy and difference control",
    "it has been possible for a homogeneous case to integrate the dynamics exactly .",
    "while for ogy control the impulse length turns out not to be crucial , for difference control it is , and the impulse has to be shorter than a critical fraction of the period , which is of the order of half of the period and decreases for larger ljapunov exponents . such timing dependence is not completely uncommon in feedback systems with delay ; in time - continuous feeedback control , a half - period feedback resulted in an enlarged stability range @xcite .",
    "techniques of chaos control , be it poincar - based , following the pyragas technique , or open - loop @xcite have been of great interest not only in technical systems , but also in biologically , especially neural systems and excitable media @xcite . besides the approach of controlling pathological neural subsystems directly , the intact brain already bears implementations of feedback control @xcite , implying that the failure of the respective circuits eventually results in migraine or stroke . also the human gait system , as virtually any perception - motor system , performs control of a bio - mechanical system with delays ; and disturbances of the delay loops as well as the cortical control may result in tremor and related movement disorders @xcite . in the thalamocortical system ,",
    "a designated impulse shape , formed by the so - called slow waves that emerge in the cortex during s2 sleep , has been shown to act as an open - loop controller of thalamic oscillator networks @xcite .",
    "this offers further possibilities to influence human sleep in the case of sleep disturbances : recent control techniques by transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation @xcite have been demonstrated to influence human sleep as well as to affect memory consolidation during sleep . in",
    "most of these techniques , the impulse shape and relative duration of the control impulse has significant impact on the results , thus different control goals may become accessible within the same setup . for the systematic understanding",
    "how such control techniques influence the brain , detailed models are of likewise importance as the methodical understanding of the theoretically possible control methods .",
