    "differential rotation , until it becomes suppressed by viscosity or strong enough magnetic fields @xcite , might play an important role in the evolution of a newly born neutron star .",
    "( for a typical neutron star it takes between 10 - 100 years to become uniformly rotating @xcite . )",
    "the equilibrium stellar models representing neutron star s differential rotation were explored in some older papers @xcite , and the oscillation frequencies for some types of fluid modes were calculated later in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the evolution of linear perturbations in a slowly rotating neutron star with a polytropic equation of state .",
    "moreover , the rotation profile of the star represents a first order deviation from the uniform rotation .",
    "we generalize the old semi - analytical results of hartle for the uniformly rotating equilibrium model @xcite to a small deviation from the uniform rotation following the relativistic j - constant law .",
    "in particular we show that under a first order deviation from the slow uniform rotation one can still separate spherical harmonics and obtain only a very small number of non - zero terms in their expansion .",
    "furthermore , similar to the uniformly rotating case @xcite , one can find an exact analytic solution for the metric dragging function outside the star .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] of this paper we use the consistency conditions imposed by the equilibrium model to constrain the value of the parameter representing the differential rotation , ( for the given equilibrium parameters of the star ) . such a relatively simple equilibrium model with the constrained value of the differential rotation parameter",
    "is then used in section [ sec : perturb ] , in the cowling approximation , to explore the various types of fluid modes . to obtain numerical results for the modes , in section [ sec : numerics ] we evolve the initial perturbation in time using a 2d lax - wendroff scheme @xcite .",
    "our choice of a time evolution treatment is motivated by the co - rotation problem that affects the usual eigenvalue approach for obtaining the mode frequencies .",
    "the f - modes were computed for the slow rotation case in @xcite and we compare our results with the results from those papers , further constraining the domain of validity of the differential rotation parameter .",
    "in addition to the results of @xcite , we explore in more detail the behavior of the f - modes as a function of small values of the differential rotation parameter and we also find numerical values for some of the r - mode frequencies .",
    "( as can be seen in @xcite the r - modes excite differential rotation in the stellar fluid . )",
    "also , the f - mode eigenfunctions are extracted by using a pointwise discrete fourier transform ( dft ) on the evolution data .",
    "as the equilibrium stars have slow rotation with a low degree of differential rotation , the eigenmodes extracted show small change from their non - rotating counterpart . in section [ sec : gw ] , by using a quadrupole estimate of gravitational emission timescale , we see a tendency that the differential rotation slightly suppresses the gravitational emission .",
    "these results are consistent with the results of @xcite for the rapidly rotating stars .",
    "finally , we finish with our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "consider the background spacetime of a slowly rotating star : @xmath0^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the frame dragging function .",
    "we will use a polytropic equation of state @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure and @xmath7 is the rest mass energy density of the star .",
    "the fluid rotation is described by the 4-velocity @xmath8 further , we consider that the rotation of the fluid , @xmath9 , obeys the @xmath10-constant law : @xmath11 the @xmath12 parameter in the equation describes the level of the differential rotation of the star",
    ". then the tov equations remain unchanged under the slow rotation ( in the linear order in @xmath9 ) , and the frame dragging parameter @xmath13 has to be a solution of the equation :      furthermore , take the differential rotation to be also small , representing only a linear order perturbation from the uniform rotation case : @xmath15",
    ". then one can expand @xmath13 in the @xmath12 parameter as : @xmath16 here @xmath17 corresponds to the case of uniform rotation and as we know from @xcite , it depends only on @xmath3 .",
    "( in the zeroth order expansion of in @xmath12 we obtain hartle s equation for the uniform rotation problem @xcite . ) now , let us write the first order equation ( in @xmath12 ) , which represents a correction due to a small differential rotation modifying the uniform rotation problem .",
    "this will be :      due to the fact that @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath19 , one can simplify the problem by decomposing the terms in the equation into the vector spherical harmonics and one obtains ( symbol ``  @xmath20  '' means @xmath3-derivative ) :      here @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a @xmath24 coefficient of the decomposition of @xmath25 into vector spherical harmonics .",
    "one can express the decomposition as @xmath26 and thus the only two non - zero coefficients @xmath23 of the decomposintion are  @xmath27  and   @xmath28 .",
    "the two linearly independent solutions of the equation behave for @xmath29 , both close to zero and at infinity , as @xmath30 the @xmath31 case shows the same behavior at the infinity , but close to zero one has to be more careful : one can try to taylor expand the solutions at the origin , proving that only one of the solutions is analytic around zero .",
    "then one can naturally expect , that also in the case @xmath31 one of the solutions is singular at zero .",
    "( for more details see [ regularity ] . )",
    "it can be easily shown that in case @xmath32 ,  @xmath29 , the regular behavior of the solution at the infinity can not be matched with the regular behavior at zero ( see again appendix [ regularity ] ) .",
    "this means for @xmath32 _ no _ non - trivial relevant solutions exist . on the other hand , for @xmath33 we can ,",
    "through the green function , construct everywhere regular non - trivial solutions .",

    "( this is because the equation can be rewritten outside the star into the form of the hypergeometric equation . )",

    "( all the terms with powers higher than @xmath45 cancel out .",
    "the derivation of the solutions and their asymptotic behavior is left for the appendix [ frame dragging ] . )",
    "let us also add that the physical meaning of the constants @xmath46 is the following : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the angular momentum of the star .",
    "the procedure for numerically computing the frame dragging @xmath13 is the following : first we numerically determine @xmath49 by solving eq .",

    "then , due to the fact that the first derivative of @xmath168 vanishes at @xmath169 the equation can be written as : @xmath170_{r_{e}}=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\ e^{\\lambda}~j~r_{e}^{2}\\left[\\ell(\\ell+1)-2 + 16\\pi r_{e}^{2}(\\epsilon+p)\\right]\\omega_{1\\ell}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but this equation can not be fulfilled for a very simple reason : in case of a local maximum @xmath171 , and thus the left side of the equation must be negative , whereas the right side of the equation has always the same sign as @xmath168 , and @xmath168 is at the local maximum positive .",
    "( as we said before the local maximum is taken to be such that @xmath168 is at the local maximum positive . ) in case of local minimum the opposite holds : @xmath172 and thus the left side of the equation must be positive , whereas the right side of the equation must be negative , because @xmath168 is at the local minimum negative .",
    "this argumentation means that @xmath168 for any @xmath173 must be represented by a trivial , zero solution .",
    "but what about  @xmath174   and  @xmath175 ?",
    "( with @xmath174 regularity is not an issue , but one still requires that it shall have zero at infinity . ) here the situation is very different , since on the right side of the equation appears another term proportional to @xmath176 and this prevents us from determining the sign of the right side of the equation at the extremum of @xmath177 .",
    "this means both  @xmath178   are in the game , and one has to proceed further in the analysis .",
    "let us analyse the solutions in case @xmath31 near zero . for @xmath31",
    "the equation turns close to 0 to a more complicated equation : @xmath179 with @xmath180 $ ] .",
    "this equation seems not to have analytic solution , but one can verify that one and only one of the solutions is regular at 0 by decomposing @xmath55 into mclaurin series ( or taylor series at zero ) @xmath181 and after doing this one obtains      this means there is only one solution that can be decomposed close to 0 to mclaurin series and that strongly indicates that the other solution is singular at 0 .",
    "thus qualitatively the case @xmath31 is the same than other , @xmath29 cases .",
    "take the equation outside the star .",
    "consider that outside the star holds ( @xmath42 being the mass of the star ) : @xmath184 then the equation can be rewritten outside the star in the form @xmath185\\omega_{1\\ell}=0.\\ ] ] after redefining the variable  @xmath186   and some algebras one can rewrite the equation in the following form : @xmath187\\omega_{1\\ell}=0.\\ ] ] by `` @xmath20 ''",
    "we mean here a @xmath129-derivative .",
    "now consider that is a hypergeometric equation with coefficients that can be chosen as :      ( note that @xmath191 are in fact minus exponents in the asymptotic formula . ) unfortunately , due to the fact that @xmath192 is an integer , can not be solved by a linear combination of 2 - 1 type hypergeometric functions ( multiplied by powers of @xmath129 ) , which is a generic solution for hypergeometric equation .",
    "although this can not be done , let us proceed further : the only relevant @xmath193 are @xmath194 , for @xmath31 we already know the general solution and this is : @xmath195 for @xmath196 the equation becomes @xmath197 the software mathematica found to the equation the following analytic solution :      we can see that the first term is the @xmath199 divergent term .",
    "it is slightly less obvious that the other term is actually the convergent part of the solution behaving as @xmath200 .",
    "one has to substitute @xmath201 and take the mclaurin series expansion of @xmath202 then if one expresses the second solution term in @xmath7 :              m. d. duez , y. t. liu , s. l. shapiro , m. shibata and b. c. stephens , `` evolution of magnetized , differentially rotating neutron stars : simulations in full general relativity '' , phys.rev . d*73 * ( 2006 ) 104015 , arxiv : astro - ph/0605331              s. yoshida , l. rezzolla , s. karino and y. eriguchi , `` frequencies of f - modes in differentially rotating relativistic stars and secular stability limits '' , astrophys.j . *",

    "<S> newly born neutron stars can present differential rotation , even if later it should be suppressed by viscosity or a sufficiently strong magnetic field . and in this early stage of its life , a neutron star is expected to have a strong emission of gravitational waves , which could be influenced by the differential rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a new formalism for modelling differentially rotating neutron stars : working on the slow rotation approximation and assuming a small degree of differential rotation , we show that it is possible to separate variables in the einstein field equations . </S>",
    "<S> the dragging of inertial frames is determined by solving three decoupled odes . </S>",
    "<S> after we establish our equilibrium model , we explore the influence of the differential rotation on the f and r - modes of oscillation of the neutron star in the cowling approximation , and we also analyze an effect of the differential rotation on the emission of gravitational radiation from the f - modes . we see that the gravitational radiation from the f - modes is slightly suppressed by introducing differential rotation to the equilibrium stars . </S>"
