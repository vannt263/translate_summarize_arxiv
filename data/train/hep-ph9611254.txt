    "the building blocks of the standard model  @xcite of particle physics are listed in table 1 .",
    "the fundamental electromagnetic , weak , strong and gravitational forces are carried by the photon @xmath0 , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the gluon and ( we firmly believe ) the graviton , respectively . of these ,",
    "the @xmath0 , gluon and graviton are thought to be massless , whilst the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 are as heavy as medium - sized nuclei : @xmath3 and @xmath4 gev , respectively  @xcite , leading to the very short @xmath5 cm range of the weak forces , as opposed to the very large and probably infinite ranges of the electromagnetic forces .",
    "one of the greatest issues in particle physics - which will be discussed extensively in this talk - is to understand why the @xmath1 and @xmath2 intermediate bosons behave so differently from their peers , although their basic properties , such as spins and couplings to matter particles , seem so similar .",
    ".particles in the standard model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another effect first surfaced as variations in the lep energy during fills , which diminished during the night  @xcite .",
    "these were eventually traced to nearby electric trains : see the passage of a tgv in fig .",
    "the explanation is that some of the return current passes through the earth , and in particular through lep ( which is a relatively good conductor ) . since the lep beam energy shifted during the course of each fill , and",
    "since the beam was calibrated at the ends of the fills , there was a systematic correction to the beam energy and hence @xmath6 of a few mev , which has now been taken into account in the value quoted in table  2  @xcite .",
    ".3 cm .3 cm    turning now to some of the other measurements in table  2 , the relative beam energy calibrations are also important for the determination of @xmath7 , but the tgv effect is not so important , since it tends to move all the beam energies by similar amounts .",
    "last year , measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath9 appeared to come into significant disagreement with the standard model predictions , but this anomaly now seem to have evaporated , as we discuss in section 5 . in the previous year , there had been some concern about the compatibility of the lep and slc measurements of the electroweak mixing angle sin@xmath10 , but this no longer seems to be a significant discrepancy  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "finally , note the accuracy with which the effective number of light @xmath11 species has now been measured  @xcite : @xmath12 i had always hoped @xmath13 would turn out to be non - integer , say @xmath14 or , even better , @xmath15 , but this was not to be .",
    "even so , the measurement ( [ nnu ] ) is a useful constraint on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , as we discuss later .",
    "what use are the precise numbers in table  2 ?",
    "one answer is provided by their sensitivity to the masses of unseen particles , via quantum ( radiative ) corrections .",
    "for example , at one loop : @xmath16 and the correction @xmath17 is sensitive to the masses of the top quark and the higgs boson . in the case of the top ,",
    "the sensitivity is quadratic  @xcite : @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "this sensitivity enables precision data to be used to a theoretical prediction for @xmath20 . in the case of the higgs boson ,",
    "the sensitivity is unfortunately only logarithmic at the one - loop level  @xcite : @xmath21 \\label{mhdep}\\ ] ] making the use of precision data to predict @xmath22 much more delicate .",
    "if just one quantum correction is determined , e.g. , @xmath17 from measurements of @xmath23  ( [ deltar ] ) , a trade - off between the values of @xmath20 and @xmath22 is possible , but these can both be determined if enough quantum corrections are pinned down  @xcite .",
    "our latest prediction of @xmath20 , based on a @xmath24 analysis of the available precision electroweak data shown is  @xcite @xmath25 including the error associated with leaving @xmath22 a free parameter .",
    "this prediction of @xmath20 is compatible with the latest fermilab measurement  @xcite : @xmath26 the consistency between ( [ mtpred ] ) and ( [ mtmeas ] ) is a non - trivial check of the standard model at the quantum level .",
    "the agreement between ( [ mtpred ] ) and ( [ mtmeas ] ) also means that they can legitimately be combined to yield  @xcite @xmath27 which is the current best estimate of @xmath20 within the standard model .",
    "let us now address in more detail the central issue of the origin of mass : how come the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are massive , whereas the @xmath0 and gluon are massless ?",
    "the core of this problem lies in the fact that a massless spin-@xmath28 particle has only two polarization states with helicities @xmath29 , whereas a massive spin-@xmath28 particle has three polarization states : @xmath30 .",
    "the suggestion is that the primordially massless @xmath1 and @xmath2 combine with extra spin-@xmath31 particles which provides their third polarization states , enabling them to become massive . as we shall discuss in more detail shortly",
    ", realistic electroweak models require there to exist at least one physical scalar , in addition to the spin-@xmath31 degrees of freedom ` eaten ' by the massive @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there is no direct experimental evidence for such a higgs boson , and searches at lep have established the lower limit @xmath32 there are , however , theoretical arguments based on unitarity , which suggest that  @xcite @xmath33 and hence that the higgs boson may lie within the reach of the next generation of accelerators , such as the lhc discussed in section 7 .    at a more theoretical level , the problem of mass can be seen as requiring a ` breakdown ' of the electroweak gauge symmetry . to avoid non - renormalizability problems in higher - order calculations , this ` breakdown ' should only be spontaneous , i.e.",
    ", it should be due to the condensation in the electroweak vacuum of some field @xmath34 with non - zero electroweak isospin : @xmath35 the numerical values of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses indicate a particular ratio @xmath36 which corresponds to the simplest choice @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "this is what is required also to give masses to the quarks and leptons , and was the choice of weinberg and salam when they originally wrote down the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the next big question is whether this field @xmath34 sitting in the vacuum is elementary ( as weinberg and salam postulated ) or composite .",
    "the latter possibility may be appealing to many of you from a condensed - matter background , who are familiar with the role of cooper pairs in superconductivity and pairing in superfluid @xmath38he , and could also be reminiscent of quark condensation in qcd : @xmath39 .",
    "composite higgs models have included @xmath40 condensate models  @xcite - but these initially wanted @xmath41 gev , and are now looking for epicycles - and so - called technicolour models  @xcite , which postulate new fermions bound by new interactions that become strong on an energy scale around @xmath28 tev .",
    "at least the simplest versions of such models seem to be disfavoured by a @xmath24 analysis of the precision electroweak measurements  @xcite , as seen in fig .  2 , and variations in these models are now also being explored .",
    "2.5 cm    in the absence so far of a credible composite alternative , we are led to examine more closely the elementary possibility .",
    "if there is just a single @xmath42 higgs doublet , consisting of two complex fields , the three degrees of freedom eaten by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 leave behind a single physical higgs boson to be detected .",
    "a @xmath24 analysis of precision electroweak data within the minimal standard model with just this one physical elementary higgs boson leads to the estimate  @xcite , see also  @xcite : @xmath43 figure 3 displays @xmath44 contours in the @xmath45 plane , for a fit  @xcite to the precision electroweak data which includes the direct cdf and d0 measurements of @xmath20 .",
    "these results are quite consistent with the idea of a weakly - coupled elementary higgs boson within reach of planned accelerators .",
    "there are , however , theoretical problems with such a simple possibility , associated with the gross disparities in the known mass scales in physics .",
    "the only candidate we have for a fundamental mass scale is the planck mass , related to newton s constant : @xmath46 .",
    "why is @xmath47 ?",
    "this is commonly known as the hierarchy problem  @xcite , which can be rephrased as : why is @xmath48 ? some atomic and condensed - matter physicists may consider this question remote from their concerns , but it is equivalent to the question : why is the coulomb potential in an atom so much smaller than the newtonian potential , i.e. , why is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a typical particle mass ?",
    "these questions are particularly worrying for models with an elementary higgs boson , because its mass is subject to large quantum corrections , meaning that the small physical value ( [ uppermh ] ) can be obtained only at the expense of extreme fine tuning .",
    "one usually prefers that quantum corrections to a measurable quantity not be much larger than its physical value , since otherwise its value would seem unnatural  @xcite .",
    "an example of a physical quantity with naturally small quantum corrections is a fermion mass : @xmath51 which is not much greater than @xmath52 for any plausible value of the cutoff @xmath53 .",
    "the same can not be said for quantum corrections to the mass of an elementary higgs boson , which are quadratically divergent : @xmath54 if one inserts a guess for the cutoff @xmath55 or @xmath56 up to which the standard model may be valid , one gets a correction which is many orders of magnitude greater than the possible physical value of @xmath22 .",
    "this unpleasant conclusion can be avoided by observing that the fermion and boson loops have opposite signs : @xmath57 the leading quadratic divergences will therefore cancel if there are equal numbers of bosons and fermions : @xmath58 , and if their couplings are identical : @xmath59 .",
    "these are the conditions that a field theory manifest supersymmetry  @xcite . after the cancellation which it enforces ,",
    "the remainder @xmath60 will be small , rendering the hierarchy natural , if @xmath61 it is this squared - mass difference that should be interpreted as the cut off @xmath62 at which new physics modifies the standard model .",
    "although there are other arguments for supersymmetry , such as its intrinsic beauty and its necessity for the consistency of string theory , this is the only argument to indicate that supersymmetry should appear at an accessible mass scale .",
    "it should be emphasized that this argument is , nevertheless , qualitative and a matter of taste : even an unnatural theory may be renormalizable .",
    "mathematically , all one needs for renormalizability is that all @xmath63 cutoff dependence can be absorbed by a finite set of bare parameters : _ a priori _ there is no need for the bare parameters and the quantum corrections to be comparable , as is implied by the naturalness argument .",
    "the latter is a physical argument motivated by the absence of fine tuning , not a precise mathematical requirement .",
    "the first question you might ask is whether any of the known fermions ( quarks , leptons ) could be the supersymmetric partners of any of the known bosons ( @xmath64 , higgs , gluon ) .",
    "the answer is no  @xcite , because the fermions and bosons have different internal quantum numbers , and hence different couplings .",
    "for example , quarks are in triplets * 3 * of colour , whereas the the known bosons are singlets or octets * 8 * of colour , and leptons are the only particles that carry lepton number l. one is therefore led to introduce supersymmetric partners for all the known particles , as shown in table 3 .",
    "supersymmetry is not economical in particles , though it is economical in principle !",

    "completing these searches will be the task of future accelerators , such as the lhc discussed in section 7 .",
    "of particular interest is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , denoted by @xmath81 , which is expected to be stable in many models , and is therefore a good candidate for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) believed to constitute most of the matter in the universe .",
    "4(a ) shows the experimental lower limit on its mass , @xmath82 obtained by the aleph collaboration  @xcite by combining searches at lep @xmath28 and @xmath83 , and assuming large slepton masses . as discussed in  @xcite , this and other loopholes in the aleph analysis that may be filled by additional theoretical and cosmological inputs , and , as also seen in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the bound ( [ aleph ] ) may be strengthened  ) be strengthened to about @xmath84 gev without additional assumptions  @xcite . ] to @xmath85 as can be seen in fig .",
    "4(b ) , in many models the lsp @xmath81 has a relic cosmological density in the range of interest for cosmological cdm  @xcite , and there are reasonable prospects that it could be detected either directly or indirectly  @xcite .",
    "3.5 cm +    in view of all the experimental disappointments to date , are there any experimental reasons for believing in supersymmetry ?",
    "in my view , there are two encouraging tentative indications .",
    "one is the apparent lightness ( [ mhest ] ) of the higgs boson favoured by the precision electroweak data  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model can be calculated  @xcite , and it comes out below @xmath86 gev or so , in high consistency with ( [ mhest ] ) .",
    "the second tentative indication is furnished by the consistency of lep and other measurements of the standard model gauge coupling strengths @xmath87 with the prediction of a minimal supersymmetric gut  @xcite . as seen in the left - hand part of fig .  5 , guts both with and without supersymmetry are in good qualitative agreement with the measurements .",
    "however , when we blow up the vertical scale , as shown in the other two parts of fig .  5 , we see that the non - supersymmetric gut prediction disagrees with the data , whereas the minimal supersymmetric gut is very close .",
    "plausible variations in the supersymmetric gut model - building can bring the prediction into perfect agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "several possible experimental anomalies have been under active discussion during the past few months , and here are updates and opinions on two of them .",
    "* @xmath88 ` crisis ' at lep * : this is the disagreement between the standard model prediction for these two @xmath2 decay branching ratios ( [ rb ] ) mentioned previously , which was simmering at the @xmath89 level until a new round of preliminary measurements announced in 1995 escalated the apparent discrepancies to @xmath90 for @xmath8 and @xmath91 for @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "it should be remembered that these are among the most difficult and complex lep measurements , with large systematic errors associated with the modelling of complicated hadronic final states .",
    "one suggestion was that some misunderstanding of these problems might responsible for the apparent anomalies .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested that the discrepancies might be due to some new physics beyond the standard model , such as supersymmetry  @xcite or a new @xmath92 boson  @xcite .",
    "we studied  @xcite the former possibility , constraining possible supersymmetric models using all the available phenomenological limits on their parameters , including those from unsuccessful sparticle searches at lep and fermilab , the experimental lower limit on the mass of the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson , and the measured rate of @xmath93 decay .",
    "particularly important was the lower limit on the chargino mass from lep @xmath83 .",
    "out of over @xmath94 parameter choices with tan@xmath95 and sparticle mass parameters below @xmath96 gev , we found none that yielded a contribution to @xmath8 greater than 0.0017 , which was too small to make a significant contribution to the resolution of the @xmath8 discrepancy .",
    "we concluded that  ... it may be necessary to review carefully the calculation and simulation of the standard model contributions to @xmath8 ... \"  @xcite .",
    "considerable new effort has now been put into the simulation of @xmath97 and @xmath98 decays , and several significant new measurements of @xmath8 have been announced in the summer of 1996 , notably by the aleph , delphi and sld collaborations  @xcite .",
    "none of the new measurements disagrees significantly with the standard model .",
    "there is still some question how to combine these new results with the previous ones , but it seems that the @xmath88 anomaly is on the way to resolution within the standard model  @xcite .    * high-@xmath99 jet spectrum * : this excited considerable attention in january 1996 , when the cdf collaboration revealed their spectrum of high-@xmath99 jets at the fermilab @xmath78 collider , which exhibited for @xmath100 gev an apparent excess above standard model calculations made with the distributions of partons inside protons proposed previously  @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation within the standard model was that of modifying these model parton distributions  @xcite,@xcite , which can not be calculated accurately from first principles .",
    "possible explanations beyond the standard model included the suggestion that the parton distributions should not be altered , but that the strong coupling @xmath101 might decrease more slowly than expected in standard qcd , because of the appearance of new strongly - interacting degrees of freedom such as squarks and gluinos  @xcite .",
    "another suggestion was to keep the usual parton distributions and leave qcd unscathed , but postulate an extra interaction between quarks , due to the exchange of a new electroweak boson @xmath92 , which might also resolve the @xmath88 ` crisis ' mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "finally , the most radical interpretation was that mentioned by the cdf collaboration  @xcite , namely that quarks might be composite objects .",
    "we analyzed in detail  @xcite the possible effects of a sparticle threshold on the jet spectrum , via their quantum corrections to parton - parton scattering cross sections .",
    "the maximum effect that we found was just a few @xmath102 in a narrow region around the sparticle threshold , as seen in fig .  6 , and we found that previous calculations  @xcite far above and below threshold were unreliable guides .     +    meanwhile , uncertainties in the parton distributions have been studied carefully by two groups : one concluded that modifications in the distributions of quarks inside protons could not explain away the cdf anomaly  @xcite , whereas the other group found that it could be removed by possible modifications in the gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "this group also found that the cdf and d0 large-@xmath99 date could be reconciled once the different angular acceptances of the two experiments were taken into account , as seen in fig .",
    "it seems , therefore , that this anomaly has also found an interpretation within the standard model .",
    "we have already seen how the measurements of the different gauge couplings from lep and elsewhere are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of guts , particularly those with supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "this is fine , but what one would really like to see is some evidence for one of the novel phenomena predicted by guts , such as proton decay or neutrino masses .",
    "the start - up of the superkamiokande detector will enable existing lower limits on the proton lifetime to be improved by an order of magnitude or more  @xcite .",
    "there is no guarantee that this will be sufficient , but at least different gut models such as minimal supersymmetric @xmath103 , missing - partner @xmath103 models and flipped @xmath103 make characteristic predictions for the favoured decay modes  @xcite .",
    "thus , if proton decay is seen , models will be distinguishable .",
    "the available upper limits on neutrino masses are shown in table  1 : these are so far below the masses of the corresponding charged leptons that one might wonder whether they might vanish entirely",
    ". however , theoretically there is no good reason , such as an exact gauge symmetry , why neutrino masses should be strictly zero .",
    "indeed , the consensus among gut models is that neutrinos should have masses , though the precise form of their mass matrix is very model - dependent .",
    "one favoured possibility is the see - saw mass matrix  @xcite : ( _ l,|_r )  ( )  ( ) [ seesaw ] where @xmath104 denote the usual electroweak doublet left- and singlet right - handed neutrinos , respectively .",
    "diagonalizing ( [ seesaw ] ) leads to very light ( very nearly ) left - handed neutrinos with masses : @xmath105 by analogy with the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing of the @xmath1 couplings to the quarks , one also expects mixing between the different neutrino species , which leads in general to neutrino oscillations .",
    "neutrino oscillations rank among the possible interpretations of three anomalous phenomena in neutrino experiments .",
    "foremost among these is the * solar neutrino deficit * now seen in five experiments  @xcite .",
    "these results can not be explained away by _ ad hoc _ modifications of the standard solar model , e.g. , by simply postulating a reduction in the central temperature of the sun , without running into trouble with ( for example ) helioseismological observations  @xcite . on the other hand , there are three candidate neutrino - oscillation interpretations : in terms of matter - enhanced mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein  @xcite oscillations with a small mixing angle @xmath106 : @xmath107 or with a large mixing angle : @xmath108 or non - enhanced oscillations _ in vacuo _ : @xmath109 these different interpretations may be distinguished by new experiments now starting to take data and in preparation , notably the superkamiokande , sno and borexino experiments  @xcite",
    ".    of the three interpretations presented above , ( [ mswsmall ] ) seems the most plausible from the point of view of the see - saw mechanism ( [ seesaw ] ) , with @xmath110 furthermore , if one scales ( [ elessmu ] ) up to the @xmath111 mass as in ( [ numass ] ) , this interpretation carries with it the intriguing speculation that @xmath112 in which case the @xmath111 could provide the hot dark matter of interest to cosmologists  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath113 is in the range ( [ nutaumass ] ) , @xmath114 oscillations might be within reach of accelerator neutrino experiments .",
    "two suitable experiments are now taking data at cern  @xcite , and another is planned at fermilab  @xcite .    an * atmospheric neutrino deficit * in the ratio of @xmath115- to @xmath116-induced events has been reported by some underground detectors , notably the kamiokande and imb experiments  @xcite . however , this has not been confirmed by other experiments using different techniques , and requires further confirmation .    also in need of confirmation is the suggestion of @xmath117 oscillations by the * lsnd experiment *  @xcite , which may be forthcoming from the karmen experiment  @xcite at the rutherford - appleton laboratory .",
    "some of the best prospects for addressing key current issues in the phenomenology of particle physics will be provided by the lhc accelerator , which has been approved for construction at cern .",
    "this is planned to collide protons at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath118 tev with a luminosity of @xmath119 @xmath120s@xmath121 , and lead ions at @xmath122 pevin the centre of mass with a luminosity of @xmath123 @xmath120s@xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath124 option is primarily intended to address the issue of mass , by producing and detecting the higgs boson and supersymmetric particles , if they exist , whereas the lead - lead option is aimed at the production and detection of the quark - gluon plasma .    as seen in fig .",
    "8 , it is believed that experiments at the lhc can detect the higgs boson of the standard model if it weighs above @xmath125 gev , thus dovetailing nicely with lep @xmath126",
    ". the @xmath127 decay mode should be detectable if @xmath128 gev , and higgs decay into two real or virtual @xmath129 or @xmath130 bosons if @xmath131 tev . as seen in fig .",
    "9 , the higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model should be detectable over essentially all of the model s parameter space  @xcite .",
    "intense efforts are now underway to evaluate precisely the ability of the lhc experiments to detect the strongly - interacting squarks and gluinos .",
    "some recent results  @xcite are displayed in fig .",
    "10 : the missing - energy signature for sparticle decay stands out above the total standard model background and possible detector effects .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that experiments at the lhc can detect squarks and gluinos weighing up to @xmath132 tev  @xcite , covering the entire range ( [ susynear ] ) suggested by the naturalness of the mass hierarchy .",
    "it also seems that the lhc may be able to provide us with some precision measurements of sparticle masses  @xcite",
    "we have seen in previous sections that there are good theoretical reasons to expect new physics beyond the standard model , and that there are some tentative experimental indications that may point towards the way to go .",
    "i attach particular significance to the indications from precision electroweak measurements at lep and elsewhere that the higgs boson may be relatively light as suggested by supersymmetric models , the agreement between the measurements of gauge couplings and the predictions of simple supersymmetric guts , and the apparent solar neutrino deficit . in my view , these are pointers towards supersymmetry and guts .",
    "we are fortunate that experiments now starting to take data should be able to explore broad domains of parameter space .",
    "specifically , i have in mind the chorus and nomad neutrino oscillation experiments at cern  @xcite , lep @xmath126 , and the superkamiokande underground detector  @xcite . beyond these",
    ", we have in prospect many further neutrino oscillation experiments and the lhc to spearhead our search for new physics .",
    "ever since the establishment of the standard model , we have been waiting in vain for physics beyond the standard model to appear .",
