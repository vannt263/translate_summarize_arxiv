    "the availability of an explicit statistical characterization of the output of a wireless channel , impaired by additive and multiplicative random disturbance , is of paramount importance to communication- and information - theoretic purposes .",

    "the main difference between the two papers is in the assumption on the fading duration .",

    "the diagonal matrix of the power allocation is characterized by the eigenvalues of a matrix - variate beta joint distribution of the entries @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider both the input models described above , and derive closed form expressions of the output pdf in presence of a multiple - antenna channel affected by additive noise and block - fading . in particular , in the case of i.i.d .",
