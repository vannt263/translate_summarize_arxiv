    "in past years , the spectroscopy of heavy flavor quarkonium has seen great progress , particularly the charmonium spectrum . many charmonium - like states ( such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and so on ) with remarkable and unexpected properties",
    "have been reported .",
    "these exotic states present great challenges to our understanding of the structure of heavy flavor quarkonium and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energy , for a review , see refs.@xcite . on the other hand , many bottomonium states have been reported as well . in 2008 ,",
    "the spin - singlet pseudoscalar partner @xmath7 was found by the babar collaboration with mass @xmath8 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 was discovered in 2010 in the @xmath10 final state with mass @xmath11 mev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the babar collaboration reported the p - wave spin - singlet @xmath12 via its radiative decay into @xmath13 with mass @xmath14 mev @xcite .",
    "this state is confirmed by the belle collaboration @xcite , and its mass is measured to be @xmath15 mev .",
    "meanwhile , the radial excitation state @xmath16 was also found by the belle collaboration with mass @xmath17 mev @xcite .",
    "recently the atlas collaboration has reported the discovery of the @xmath4 state through reconstruction of the radiative decay modes of @xmath18 , and its mass barycenter is measured to be @xmath19 gev @xcite . in particular , the belle collaboration has observed an enhancement in the production process @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the fit using a breit - wigner resonance shape yields a peak mass of @xmath21 $ ] mev and a width of @xmath22 $ ] mev . in the following , we shall denote this state as @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the babar collaboration measured the @xmath24 cross section between 10.54 gev and 11.20 gev @xcite , the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 states , which are candidates of @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , were observed .",
    "their masses and widths are fitted to be @xmath29 gev , @xmath30 mev , @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 mev , which are different from the previously measured values . in particular ,",
    "two charged narrow structures at 10610 mev and 10650 mev in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 have been reported recently @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the current experimental data indicate that there may be exotic bottomonium - like structures similar to the charmonium sector .",
    "furthermore , lhcb has begun to run @xcite , belle will be updated to belle ii and a new superb factory will be built in italy @xcite , we expect that more heavy bottomonium states including the possible exotic extensions will be observed in the future .    motivated by the above exciting experimental progress in @xmath0 states",
    ", we shall carry out a careful , detailed study of bottomonium spectroscopy in this work , notably the poorly understood higher - mass @xmath0 levels .",
    "thus , we can determine whether future observed bottomonium - like states could be accommodated as canonical @xmath0 states by comparing their masses with the mass spectrum predicted in this work .",
    "it is well - known that simple potential models , which incorporate a color coulomb term at short distances , a linear scalar confining term at large distances , and a gaussian - smeared one - gluon exchange spin - spin hyperfine interactions , have been frequently used to describe both the charmonium and bottomonium spectrums .",
    "generally , the mixture between the quark model @xmath0 basis states and the two - meson continuum has been neglected in these models , which are called  quenched \" quark models .",
    "the effects of the  unquenched quark model \" including virtual hadronic loops have been studied extensively in the framework of the coupled - channel method @xcite .",
    "the hadronic loop has turned out to be highly non - trivial , it can give rise to mass shifts to the bare hadron states and contribute continuum components to the physical hadron states .",
    "the possibility that loop effects may be responsible for the anomalously low masses of the new narrow charm - strange states @xmath35 and @xmath36 has been suggested by several groups @xcite . the hadronic loop in charmonium has been explored as well , and the mass shifts and continuum mixing due to loops of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 meson pairs have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "both the mass shifts and the two - meson continuum components of the physical charmonium states were found to be rather large . in particular , a @xmath41 state with mass about 3872 mev",
    "could possibly be generated dynamically .",
    "inspired by the large physical effects of hadronic loops in both the @xmath42 and charmonium states , we expect that the virtual hadronic loop should also play an important role in bottomonium spectroscopy . in this work",
    ", we shall study the bottomonium spectrum in detail , and take the hadronic loop effects into account .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the framework of the coupled - channel analysis in section ii .",
    "the non - relativistic potential model is outlined in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the numerical results for the masses of the bottomonium states with and without hadronic loop effects , as well as phenomenological implications .",
    "we present our conclusions and discussion in section v.",
    "coupling of @xmath43 states to the @xmath44 mesons loop.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in bottomonium , the process @xmath45 via light quark pair @xmath46 creation would induce the hadronic loop shown in fig.[figcc ] , where the initial bottomonium decays into intermediate virtual @xmath44 states and then reforms the original bottomonium state . here",
    "@xmath47 denotes a general @xmath47 meson , it can be @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 , the same convention will be used henceforth without speci?cation . since the open - flavor decay couplings of bottomonium states to two - body @xmath44 final states are large , the resulting loop effects should be important .",
    "this kind of virtual hadronic loop is universal , but it is not usually included in quark potential models and is only partially present in the quenched lattice qcd .",
    "the coupled - channel model is an appropriate framework for analyzing these hadronic loop effects @xcite . in the simplest version of the coupled - channel model @xcite ,",
    "the full hadronic state is represented as @xmath51 .",
