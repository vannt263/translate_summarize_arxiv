    "the current knowledge and main ideas of the structure , formation , evolution of the milky way bulge are under debate and in rapid development , mainly due to the recent large amount of new observations of kinematics , photometry , and abundances of bulge stars , as well as sophisticated modelling and interpretation .",
    "the milky way bulge or bulge / bar can nowadays be seen upon as the inner structure of the bar @xcite and is certainly a complex environment .",
    "it might be a composite system with a mixture of different populations , similarly to many bulges at low redshift @xcite . for recent reviews of the milky way bulge ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "originally , it was thought that the milky way bulge was a classical bulge formed by an initial collapse , with an early , rapid , and intense star formation , in an inside - out formation scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or through accretion of substructures and/or large violent merger events in the @xmath8cdm scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the observational evidence for a classical bulge has weakened and the classical contribution seems to be small @xcite , see however the discussions in @xcite and @xcite .    at present , a range of observations points toward a complex situation which may be consistent with multiple components / populations or gradients within populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the one hand , kinematic surveys , e.g. @xcite and @xcite are strongly consistent with the bar / x - structure being the predominant population by mass ( see also * ? ? ? * )",
    ". however , there are strong correlations observed between abundances and kinematics , which pose challenges to any unified picture ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the chemical evolution models of @xcite , the modelled spheroidal component formed rapidly on a short timescale via an intense burst of star formation in a classical gravitational gas collapse , and the component created by bar evolution formed later on a longer time scale .",
    "note , however , that much of the metal - rich component has elevated alphas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also this work ) .",
    "the nature of these components are not certain ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and associating them with specific formation scenarios should be done with caution @xcite .",
    "important diagnostics for discriminating between models of bulge formation and evolution are _",
    "( i ) _ @xmath0-abundance trends with metallicity , and _",
    "( ii ) _ spatial abundance - gradients in the bulge :    _ ( i ) _ abundance trends can set constraints on the formation time - scales of the different components @xcite .",
    "the dynamics and abundance trends of bulge stars from the metal - poor component ( even though there are differences , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) point to similarities especially with the ( local ) thick disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite show that from a chemical point of view , an inside - out formation , modelled with a initial collapse , be it a due to an early star burst in a disk , a classical bulge , or a thick disk , fits the chemical data .",
    "large samples with chemistry and dynamics are needed in order to constrain the formation in detail . _",
    "( ii ) _ abundance gradients are important outcomes of formation models .",
    "there is observational evidence that there is a metallicity gradient from @xmath9 to @xmath10 latitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the origin of this is debated .",
    "it could either reflect varying relative proportions of the different components @xcite or it could reflect an intrinsic metallicity gradient produced by the bar due to an original disk gradient @xcite . within @xmath11 , only a few investigations of the metallicity distribution based on stellar spectra at medium- and high resolutions exist . the galactic centre ( gc ) and the region defined by the inner few hundred parsecs have escaped detailed study of stellar abundances and abundance gradients from giants , due to the extreme optical obscuration , resulting in only a handful studies in the literature .",
    "@xcite provide evidence for a break in the gradient , being absent with a narrow metallicity distribution at [ fe / h]@xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 to the south of the galactic centre .",
    "these studies are based on @xmath15 spectroscopy of 50 giants observed in the h band .",
    "recently , @xcite found a double - peaked distribution with peaks at slightly sub - solar and super - solar metallicities at a northern latitude of @xmath16 , based on medium - resolution spectra of 112 stars in the field . @xcite and @xcite obtained k - band spectra of the supergiant population in the galactic center , finding [ fe / h]@xmath17 , with a narrow dispersion .",
    "recently , @xcite also find a metallicity peak in the galactic centre at [ fe / h]@xmath18 , but with a slightly larger spread , also from k - band spectra .",
    "all these galactic centre studies are based on approximately 10 stars each , so caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions .",
    "recently , @xcite determined metallicities of 83 giants within the inner 1 pc of the galactic center , based on low - resolution ifu spectra ( @xmath19 ) , and found an surprisingly large dispersion ( @xmath20[fe / h]@xmath21 ) .",
    "high - resolution spectra are needed to validate these results .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss these issues for the inner bulge , within a projected distance of 300 pc ( @xmath22 ) from the center of the galaxy . to overcome the extreme optical extinction in these regions , we observe all our stars at @xmath23@xmath2 .",
    "the extinction in the k band is a factor of 10 lower that in the v band @xcite .",
    "the large crowding of stars can be dealt with thanks to adaptive optics .",
    "to ensure a detailed abundance analysis , we record our spectra with high spectral resolution .",
    "we will be able to link the galactic center and the bulge by analysing similar stars and using the same analysis techniques including the same spectral region and high spectral resolution , which to our knowledge has not really been done before .",
    "the luminosity and temperature ranges of our stars in the galactic center and the other two fields is similar as well . as presented in @xcite",
    ", we also argue that this population is at least 1 gyr old , with no substantial membership from the youngest 10 myr stars .",

    "we do not know the cause for the difference in the high - metallicity end .",
    "one possibility is the large difficulty in measuring metallicities , due to the increased number of blends , known and unknown .",
    "not taking these into account will systematically lead to too high metallicities .",

    "we thus find that the metal - poor component seems to disappear at the galactic centre .",
    "this could either reflect a true absence of metal - poor stars or it could be due to a selection bias .",
    "the interstellar extinction in the galactic centre is extreme and variable and its estimates are not accurate enough , which means that it is very difficult to define an metallicity - unbiased sample of stars . due to this and due to the low number of stars",
    "we , therefore , do not want to draw too much conclusions from this fact .",
    "@xcite find that the metal - rich component is more concentrated to the plane and progressively disappears with increasing latitude , whereas the metal - poor component shows the same trends and distributions , and kinematics at all the regions investigated , namely @xmath126 .",

    "before , discussing the metallicity gradients in the inner bulge further , we will discuss our galactic chemical evolution modelling of the inner bulge .",

    "we assume a very efficient star formation ( with efficiency larger than a factor of 20 relative to the solar vicinity ) , an imf with more massive stars than normally adopted for the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that the bulk of bulge stars formed during a fast episode of gas infall occurring on a timescale of @xmath131 gyr .",
    "the adopted stellar yields are the same as in @xcite for massive , low- and intermediate mass stars and supernovae type ia .",
    "these yields have been tested on solar neighbourhood stars and can well reproduce the observed [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] trends in those stars .    in figure [ vale ]",
    "we show the predictions of this model for the inner 500 pc relative to the abundance ratios [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] .",
    "we report two curves where the only difference are the yields of mg and si from massive stars .",
    "one curve represents the best model of @xcite where the yields of mg and si from massive stars are taken from @xcite , whereas the other curve represents a model where the kobayashi et al .",
    "yields of mg and si have been decreased by a factor of 1.35 .",
    "this is allowed by the fact that theoretical yields have uncertainties .",
    "therefore , the two curves mark the theoretical uncertainties in the stellar yields .",
    "the agreement with the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] trend is good for both elements , confirming our previous conclusions in @xcite about the fast formation of the bulk of bulge stars .",
    "it is worth noting that the fraction of sne ia in the imf ( @xmath132 ) , adopted in the model , well reproduces the sne ia rate quoted by @xcite . in particular ,",
    "our predicted rate is @xmath133 sne ia per century .",
    "this value is larger than previous estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , who quoted 0.03 sne ia per century but pointed out that their value for the type ia sn rate is an order of magnitude lower than expected to explain the large positron injection rate into the galactic centre region , as observed by integral ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the more recent value of @xcite , instead , is between 0.25 and 0.3 sneia per century , in very good agreement with our predicted one .",

    "the origin of the gas can either be from merger processes or from accretion of inner disk gas ( galactic bar ) .",

    "the three top panels of figure [ mdf ] show the metallicity distributions for our three inner bulge fields .",

    "also , there might be a selecition effect against metal - poor stars in the galacitc center field , that we have not quantified . with these caveats in mind ,",
    "our data shows that the distributions progressively get more metal - rich in the mean , as we approach the galactic centre .",
    "the data are consistent with a vertical metallicity gradient . taking the straight mean of the metallicities of the giants in every field , we arrive at a metallicity gradient of @xmath134 dex / degree or @xmath135 dex/100pc corresponds to 140 pc ] .",
    "the metal - rich component seems to be stable whereas the metal - poor stars are absent in the galactic centre field .",
    "one should , however , be cautious due to the few stars yet available ; given the number of stars in the galactic centre field ( 9 ) and the number of stars with [ fe / h]@xmath136 in the other fields ( 4/19 ) , it is not so unlikely that metal - poor stars were missed in the galactic center field only because of the small number of observed stars .",
    "taking the statistics from the two other fields as a basis , we get @xmath137 , which is not a negligibly small probability that no star with [ fe / h]@xmath136 is found if nine stars are being observed .    whether there are two components with different proportions at different latitudes or not , is still debated .",
    "it should be noted that if there were a clearly distinct metal - poor population with higher scale height and significant numbers , that population should have presented itself clearly in the brava survey @xcite , which is did not .",
    "the cylindrical rotation signature of brava is stable through @xmath138 , which argues for a single population with an intrinsic gradient .",
    "it is qualitatively well established that there exists a metallicity gradient in the outer bulge along the minor axis from @xmath139 to @xmath140 of the order of @xmath141 to @xmath113 dex / deg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is close to what @xcite predicted based on a chemodynamic model after a initial collapse , of the inner 500 pc region of the bulge .",
    "@xcite study 1200 bulge stars from the _ gaia_-eso survey in 5 fields , the closest being at a latitude of @xmath10 and find a gradient of @xmath108dex / degree ( @xmath143 ) , which however vanishes at @xmath144 .",
    "when extrapolating their variation of the two main components from @xmath10 inward , they predict a dominance of the metal - rich component and therefore a weakening of the gradient , which mainly reflects the relative strengths of the two components .",
    "this is also seen in the investigation by @xcite of field stars around terzan 5 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite determine a gradient of between @xmath145 and @xmath113dex / degree for the region @xmath146 and @xcite determined a gradient of the order of @xmath121dex / degree for the region @xmath144 .",
    "this is also what we find , for our inner fields ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "based on our data and these numbers there could be a metallicity gradient of the same order of magnitude extending all the way into the centre .",
    "however , in order to state something firmly , we would need many more stars analysed in the same maner and we would need to quantify the selection effect against metal - poor stars , if any .",
    "thus , a gradient may be present all the way to the center , but this finding requires further confirmation .",

    "however , at the galactic centre , @xcite and @xcite find a narrow metal - rich population at [ fe / h]@xmath18 based on k band spectra .",
    "recently , @xcite also find a metallicity peak in the galactic centre at [ fe / h]@xmath18 , but with a slightly larger spread , also from k - band spectra .",

    "recently , @xcite find metal - poor stars beyond 50 pc from the galactic center , indicating the presence of a metal - poor population .",

    "the detailed studies of @xcite of m giants at @xmath155 in the the @xmath156 , mentioned above , probe the same region as our and uses the same type of objects , even though our m giants lie at @xmath157 in the galactic center and @xmath158 in the southern fields , whereas theirs lie a bit brighter at @xmath159 .",
    "they find a narrow iron - abundance distribution of [ fe / h]=@xmath153 for all three fields , but we find a broader distribution .",
    "this discrepancy has to be investigated . in order to understand the origin of this difference",
    ", we are currently making an differential analysis of these two samples , and investigating the selection of the observed giants in each paper , including how interstellar extinction is traced .",
    "what causes the metallicity gradient in the bulge is a matter of debate .",
    "early on , a gradient was though to be an evidence for a classical bulge , formed rapidly by an initial collapse , or through accretion of substructures and/or large violent merger events in the @xmath8cdm scenario .",
    "however , it has been shown that a gradient can occur also in a purely secular formation scenario ; an intrinsic metallicity gradient could , for example , be produced by the bar due to an original disk gradient @xcite , or may be caused by winds .",
    "it is interesting to note that other bulges in spiral galaxies have measured vertical metallicity gradients ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how large spiral galaxies and their various structures are formed is not know today ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". an important step on the way to the clarifying this issue , is to study the milky way bulge , which is a major component of our galaxy , a galaxy which we can study in detail .",
    "important observables in this context are the [ @xmath0/fe ] trends as a function of metallicity and the latitudinal metallicity - gradients . in this paper",
    ", we have presented new abundances and gradients of 28 m - giants located in the inner 300 pc of the milky way bulge .",
    "we observed the giants at high spectral resolution in the k band , in order to avoid the extreme visual extinction .",
    "our [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] abundances as a function of metallicity show similar behaviour in all three fields , from the galactic centre out to a latitude of @xmath37 .",
    "the abundance trends also follow the trends of stars at lower latitudes , in the ` outer ' bulge : the abundance ratios are constant up to [ fe / h]@xmath160 , after which they turn down reaching close to solar - values at [ fe / h]=0 .",
    "the ratios then level off at values slightly above scaled - solar values , up to a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath161 .",
    "we thus find a lack of an [ @xmath0/fe]-gradient in the inner bulge region , similarly to what has been found for the rest of the bulge .",
    "we thus conclude that the lack of an [ @xmath0/fe ] gradient further out extends all the way into the galactic centre , which means a rapid formation scenario and a homogeneity of the enrichment process @xcite .",
    "our galactic chemical evolution modelling of the inner 300 pc of the bulge shows that our observed abundance ratios and the metallicity distributions , are compatible with this region having experienced a main early , rapid ( @xmath162 gyr ) , strong burst of star formation , with a high star - formation efficiency .",
    "also , it indicates a need for an imf skewed to relatively more massive stars compared to the solar vicinity .",
    "the inner 300 pc includes the central molecular zone ( cmz ) , with a recent ( second burst of ) intense star formation .",
    "this second burst can not have been trigged by more than a modest episode of gas infall or accretion of gas induced by the bar @xcite .",
    "this episode does not affect the abundance patterns , however .",
    "our data shows a trend where the fraction of metal - poor stars increases the further away from to the galactic centre one looks . in the light of the fact that @xcite find no metal - poor stars in the inner @xmath163 , and",
    "since we only have very few stars yet observed in every region , and since there might be selection effects in the galacitc center field due to extreme and variable extinction , often not precisely known , we can not conclude anything about the inner metallicity gradient .",
    "more stars in every field is thus needed to draw firm conclusions , which we retrain from doing yet .",
    "a metallicity gradient is well established in the bulge at @xmath142 from several different studies . whether this gradient continues all the way into the galactic centre or",
    "not , our data can not tell for certain .",
    "what we do find is a quite a large range of metallicities in the inner bulge .    to summarise ,",
    "we have presented the first study to connect old stars in the galactic center with the bulge , using high - resolution spectroscopy , stars of similar luminosities , temperatures , and gravities , and using the same analysis methods , including the same spectral region .",
    "it firmly argues for the center being in the context of the bulge rather than very distinct .",
    "one may tentatively conclude that the very center was not built by the infall of halo or even bulge - like globular clusters , based on metallicity .",
    "the @xmath0-element trends with metallicity are very similar for the different regions .",
    "only the metallicity distribution seems to change with latitude .",
    "this could be expected if the metal - rich component is defined by the boxy / peanut bulge , which increases its fractional importance toward the centre .",
    "the boxy / peanut bulge is the inner structure of the bar , originating from vertical instabilities in the disk .",
    "this stellar population is , therefore , expected to be similar to the inner disk @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , a distinct metal - poor population should have presented itself clearly in the brava survey @xcite , which it did not .",
