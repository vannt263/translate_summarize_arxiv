    "let us start with a brief review of the definition of the @xmath2degree invariant discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the conditions discussed below having to do with orientations are used in defining the invariant as an element of @xmath16 , rather than merely modulo @xmath17 .",
    "the data necessary for the definition are :    1 .   a smooth , simply - connected , oriented , homology - oriented @xmath1manifold @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "an @xmath20 bundle @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , and with @xmath23 .",
    "( here @xmath24 is the moduli space of anti - self - dual connections on @xmath25 . )",
    "an integral lift @xmath26 of @xmath27 .",
    "an orientation - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath28 of @xmath18 such that @xmath29 , and such that the quantity @xmath30 .",
    "the product @xmath31 in the last item indicates , roughly , whether @xmath28 preserves or reverses the orientation of the moduli space .",
    "the numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 are themselves defined as follows :    * composing a projection of @xmath34 onto @xmath35 with @xmath36 defines an isomorphism of @xmath35 with itself ; the sign of the determinant ( which is independent of all choices ) determines the spinor norm , @xmath37 . *",
    "the condition that @xmath38 implies that @xmath39 , or in other words that @xmath40 is divisible by @xmath17 in @xmath41 .",
    "one thereby can define @xmath42 .    under these conditions , for a generic metric @xmath43 ,",
    "the moduli space @xmath44 ( connections which are @xmath45anti - self - dual ) is empty .",
    "if one considers instead a generic path @xmath46 of metrics from @xmath45 to @xmath47 , then one can construct the @xmath48parameter moduli space @xmath49 } \\mm(p;g_t).\\ ] ] the count of points , with signs , in this @xmath2dimensional moduli space defines an invariant @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 if one needs to keep track of the manifold and/or the bundle ) .",
    "the independence of @xmath50 from the choice of initial metric @xmath52 and of the choice of generic path are proved using a @xmath17parameter moduli space @xmath53 here @xmath54 is a @xmath17parameter family of metrics giving a homotopy from one path of metrics @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the proof in each case uses a choice of ` boundary conditions ' for the endpoints of the homotopy .",
    "a fundamental point is that the parameter space @xmath57 is simply connected , so that an arbitrary assignment of metrics on the boundary of the @xmath58 square @xmath59 can be filled in smoothly .",
    "so for instance , to verify independence from the choice of path , use a @xmath17parameter family in which the endpoints are fixed : @xmath60 and @xmath61 . to verify that the initial metrics @xmath45 and @xmath62 give the same value for @xmath50 , use an arbitrary path from @xmath45 to @xmath62 for @xmath63 with the proviso that the right endpoints @xmath64 are equal to @xmath65 .    in both arguments ,",
    "the principle used is that on the one hand , the boundary of the @xmath17parameter moduli space @xmath66 , which is a compact @xmath48manifold , consists of algebraically @xmath2 points . on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary is also the union of the @xmath48parameter moduli spaces associated to the four sides of the @xmath58 square . in the first case , the right and left sides of the square are fixed at generic metrics defining empty moduli spaces , so the boundary is the difference between the invariant computed with the two different paths on the top and bottom . in the second case ,",
    "one must account for the additional part of the boundary , given by the difference between the ( algebraic ) count of points on the left and right sides .",
    "however , the choice of boundary conditions takes care of this , because there is an isomorphism between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and so the contributions from the two sides cancel .",
    "it is natural to try to extend @xmath50 to a polynomial in @xmath69 , by considering an @xmath70 or @xmath20 bundle @xmath25 for which the asd moduli space @xmath24 has positive odd dimension , and cutting down by divisors .",
    "recall that in the construction of the usual donaldson polynomial , the divisor associated to a surface @xmath71 in @xmath18 is defined in several steps .",
    "one first considers the space of irreducible connections on @xmath71 , together with the restriction map @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 consists of connections",
    "whose restriction to @xmath71 is irreducible .",
    "an important remark ( cf  @xcite ) is that for a generic surface @xmath74 , the moduli space @xmath24 is contained in @xmath75 . there is a natural line bundle @xmath76 , and",
    "one chooses a section , which is then pulled back to @xmath75 .",
    "if these constructions are done with some care , then the zero - set of the pulled - back section defines a divisor @xmath77 . since we are only concerned with intersections of @xmath77 with @xmath24 , we will follow the standard notational abuse and drop the superscript @xmath71 .",
    "a similar construction gives a codimension@xmath1 submanifold @xmath78 of @xmath79 which represents the dual of @xmath80 of a point @xmath81 .",
    "now these constructions depend on a number of choices , e.g. the specific representative of the homology class @xmath82 $ ] , and the choice of section of @xmath83 .",
    "if the ` space ' of possible choices were simply - connected , then one could incorporate them into the parameter space @xmath84 , and proceed precisely as in the definitions in section 2 of  @xcite .",
    "the space of sections of @xmath83 is certainly contractible , and hence simply - connected .",
    "one can in fact make sense of the space of @xmath17cycles  @xcite , and its fundamental group turns out to be precisely @xmath85 . for our purposes , though , we do not need this remarkable fact , and will work directly with the condition that @xmath86 . by poincar duality ,",
    "this is equivalent to assuming @xmath87 . for simplicity",
    ", we will in fact assume that @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath89 , which in turn is the condition needed to incorporate the @xmath2dimensional class .",

    "we assume that either @xmath22 , or that invariants are being computed in the ` strong ' stable range : @xmath91 .",
    "either of these assumptions will ensure , via the standard counting argument of donaldson theory , the compactness of all of the low - dimensional moduli spaces which appear in the definition . in section  [ basic ]",
    ", we will prove a blow - up formula , which will then be used to define @xmath50 in all degrees .    for a collection of homology classes @xmath92\\in h_2(y)$ ] , represented by embedded surfaces @xmath93",
    ", one could consider divisors @xmath94 , in sufficient numbers so that the moduli space @xmath95 is @xmath2dimensional .",

    "@xmath97 is readily seen to be independent of the choice path connecting @xmath45 and @xmath98 , by the same argument as outline above .",
    "however , the argument that this count is independent of representatives of the divisors and of initial metric @xmath45 breaks down . to see this ( and what to do about it )",
    "consider , as in the discussion above two initial metrics @xmath99 and @xmath100 , with a generic path @xmath63 between them .",
    "following that construction , we take a @xmath17parameter family of metrics @xmath54 ( with @xmath101 ) and an associated @xmath17parameter moduli space @xmath102 .",
    "intersecting with the divisors @xmath103 gives a null - cobordism of @xmath104 .",
    "_ a priori _ , @xmath28 does not match up the right and left sides of this cobordism , as one would need in order to get a cobordism between top and bottom .",

    "suppose that the diffeomorphisms have been indexed so that @xmath272 has at least one basic class which does not occur in the list of basic classes for the @xmath275 for @xmath276 .",
