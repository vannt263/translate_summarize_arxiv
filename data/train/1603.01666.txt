    "it was found that a 11%@xmath720% increase in opal opacities at the base of the cz ( bcz ) can reconcile the low - z models with helioseismology @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite showed that the increase in the opacities is no more than about 3.0% near the bcz . @xcite and @xcite found that an increase in neon abundance along with small increases in the other abundances could solve the problem with ags05 models .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite showed that the ne / o ratio is indeed consistent with the value given by ags05 .",
    "@xcite suggested that increased diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements might be able to resolve these disagreements .",
    "several groups , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite considered the effects of enhanced diffusion .",
    "they found that enhanced diffusion depletes the cz helium abundance to well below the seismically inferred value and leaves the position of the bcz too shallow .",

    "the convection overshoot does not improve the surface helium abundance .",
    "due to the fact that rotational velocity is low , centrifugal effect is negligible in agsr .",

    "the surface helium abundance of 0.2445 of agsm agrees with the seismic value at the level of @xmath117 .",
    "the density profile of this model is as good as that of gs98 m .",
    "the sound - speed profile of agsm matches very well that inferred in @xcite between 0.1 and 0.6 .",
    "the bump of the sound speed mainly appears between 0.63 and 0.71 .",
    "the relative difference of the sound speed between agsm and the sun , @xmath87 , is less than 0.0058 in the tacholine .",
    "moreover , the observed separation ratios @xmath2 and @xmath3 are almost reproduced by agsm ; the initial helium abundance of agsm is in agreement with @xmath28 given by @xcite at the level of @xmath72 @xmath1 .    the @xmath19b neutrino flux predicted by agsm agrees with the detected one and the prediction of ssem at the level of about @xmath89 . the fluxes of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath20be neutrinos computed from agsm are not far from the detected ones and the predictions of bp04 and ssem .",
    "the improvement in the sound - speed and density profiles and the cz radius mainly derives from the effects of the enhanced diffusion and overshooting which are dependent of the dynamical processes , while the improvement in the surface helium abundance and neutrino fluxes basically comes from the effects of the dynamical processes .",
    "although the gs98 ssm performs much better than the low - z models as a whole , the agreement between the low - z models and seismic and neutrino results is improved by the effects of the dynamical processes .",
