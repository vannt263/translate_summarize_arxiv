    "due to the curvature of space - time , light rays coming from a distant source object ( quasar , star or galaxy ) are deflected when passing close to a lens or deflector ( star , galaxy or cluster of galaxies ) . for weak gravitational fields",
    "the _ post - newtonian _ approximation is applicable . under this approximation",
    "the deflection angle or einstein s angle does not depend on the direction of propagation and the trayectory are approximated by straight lines .",
    "this gravitational light deflection is depicted in figure 1 . from this figure",
    "an equation , the _ gl equation _ or the _ ray tracing equation_which is obeyed by light rays passing near a lens object can be deduced :    @xmath0    where    @xmath1    @xmath2    and @xmath3 is the length scale on the lens surface . the angle @xmath4 is called the einstein s angle .",
    "the surface density of the lens is given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 represents the _ critical density _ :    @xmath7    a generalization of equation ( [ ecgl ] ) which considers the perturbation of a _ macrolens _ ( a galaxy or cluster of galaxies ) is given by    @xmath8    where the matrix @xmath9 is given by the expression    @xmath10    the components of the matrix depend upon the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 which are respectively the dimensionless constant surface mass density , the dimensionless shear of the macrolens and the shear angle .",
    "the microlens ( a star in a galaxy or a galaxy in a cluster of galaxies ) is represented by means of the einstein s angle @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig1 ] = 0.9      to simulate einstein s angle there are several models for the lens mass distribution .",
    "the gravitational lens models are divided as follows :    * parametric models * non - parametric models .    at the present time the program has only parametric models@xmath14 .",
    "the non - parametric models are lately used to model gravitational lenses@xmath14 . for weak lensing the _ kaiser - squires _ method can be applied to model lenses @xmath14 . in the program",
    "these techniques have not been implemented .",
    "the program includes the following parametric models :    * chang refsdal model , * double plane lens , * transparent sphere , * singular isothermal sphere , * nonsingular isothermal sphere , * elliptical model , * king model , * truncated king model , * hubble model , * de vaucouleur model , * spiral model , * multipole lens , * rotation lens and * uniform ring .",
