    "recently , the experimental discovery @xcite of two consecutive orbital - selective metal - insulator transitions in the effective 3-band system ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 triggered a cascade of papers also in the theoretical literature .",
    "the great interest in these `` orbital - selective mott transitions '' can easily be understood .",
    "after initial lda and dmft @xcite , band structure @xcite , and strong - coupling @xcite calculations , it became clear that the occurence of osmts in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is a non - perturbative correlation phenomenon , which generalizes the famous concept of the classical `` mott transition '' @xcite to multi - band systems with inequivalent bands .",
    "the orbital - selective nature of the transitions also raises fundamental questions , such as , e.g. , whether phase transitions in two subsystems merge or remain distinct , depending on the way these two subsystems are being coupled .",
    "the microscopic model used in the literature to describe the osmt phenomenon theoretically is the anisotropic degenerate two - orbital hubbard model with @xcite or without @xcite spin - flip terms and pair - hopping in the hamiltonian . for the model _ without _ these additional terms ( the `` @xmath3-model '' ) it was first believed @xcite that only _ one _ transition exists at low temperatures , i.e. , that the transitions which occur in the separate orbitals merge upon unison . since _",
    "two _ transitions clearly exist for the model _ with _ spin - flips and pair - hopping ( the `` @xmath4-model '' ) it was believed @xcite that these additional terms cause the two transitions of the subsystems to remain distinct and , hence , make a fundamental difference . here we show , extending previous work in @xcite , that the @xmath3-model does , in fact , also contain two distinct osmts . in this manner",
    "we establish the @xmath3-model as a _ minimal model _ for the description of the osmt phenomenon .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath3-model , @xmath5 describes hopping between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath6 with amplitude @xmath7 for orbital @xmath8 , _ intra_- and _ _ inter__orbital coulomb repulsion parametrized by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and ising - type hund s exchange coupling @xmath3 ; @xmath11 for spin @xmath12 . as usual , we consider this model with @xmath13 .",
    "specifically , our dmft ( qmc ) results for this model , to be presented below , were calculated using semi - elliptic densities of states with full bandwidths @xmath14 , @xmath15 , for the `` narrow '' and `` wide '' band , respectively , and interaction parameters @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that high - precision in the qmc simulations is _ essential _ for the investigation of osmts , since the signals of in particular the second transition are rather subtle and can easily be missed . in @xcite",
    "we showed that our qmc results for , e.g. , quasi - particle weights , have relative errors of @xmath17 even near the critical interactions @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the first and second transition , respectively .",
    "this is an improvement of up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous qmc results @xcite .",
    "the high precision in our simulations is ( at least in part ) due to the reduction of the discretization error achieved by complementing qmc data with a high - frequency expansion of the self - energy @xcite .",
    "in the following , we present qmc results for the @xmath3-model with band widths and interaction parameters as stated before .",
    "we briefly discuss one of the primary criteria used in ref .",
    "@xcite for detecting the two osmts in fig .",

    "main panel : detailed study of first transition at @xmath24 reveals hysteresis ( i.e. a @xmath25 order transition ) only for @xmath26.[fig : z],title=\"fig : \" ]    associated with both bands clearly reveals the orbital - selective character of the first transition at @xmath27 ( associated with the narrow band ) and the existence of a second transition ( associated with the wide band ) at @xmath28 : for @xmath29 , only the narrow band develops a singularity the weight of which ( filled symbols ) increases approximately linearly with @xmath9 . in contrast",
    ", the corresponding weight for the narrow band remains zero ( numerically ) up to @xmath30 ; above this point , again , a linear increase with @xmath9 is observed .",
    "note that temperature dependencies are hardly visible ; however , the kink at @xmath31 becomes slightly sharper with decreasing @xmath32 .",
    "the extraction of the weights shown in the main panel from fits to products @xmath33 is illustrated in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : wims ] .",
    "metal - insulator transitions may also be identified from discrete estimates of the quasiparticle weight @xmath34^{-1}$ ] ( even though this observable is somewhat problematic @xcite ) : kinks in @xmath20 , most markedly for the narrow band , reveal a transition at @xmath27 in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : z ] ; a second transition for @xmath28 would become apparent at higher resolution .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : z ] shows a close - up of @xmath20 near @xmath24 for a range of temperatures .",
    "evidently , the observables vary continuously with @xmath9 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; only for @xmath37 , we find first traces of stable coexistence , signaling a first - order transition .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath38 which agrees with recent independent exact diagonalization ( ed ) results @xcite , but is much lower than earlier qmc and ed estimates ( of @xmath39 @xcite and @xmath40 @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "valuable insight into the nature of phases and transitions can be gained from the spectral functions , shown for the narrow and wide band in the left and right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , respectively .     across first osmt at @xmath41 .",
    "right panel : wide - band spectral function ( for @xmath23 ) near @xmath42 .",
    "inset : values of spectral functions at fermi energy.[fig : spectra],title=\"fig : \" ]   across first osmt at @xmath41 .",
    "right panel : wide - band spectral function ( for @xmath23 ) near @xmath42 .",
    "inset : values of spectral functions at fermi energy.[fig : spectra],title=\"fig : \" ]    the narrow - band spectra show typical fermi - liquid behavior : the quasiparticle peak becomes narrow before it decays and , finally , a gap appears for @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , the wide - band quasiparticle peak remains wide , but develops a dip near the fermi energy before a full gap appears at @xmath44 .",
    "the density of states at the fermi energy , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , further illustrates the osmt scenario : at @xmath45 the narrow band undergoes a metal - insulator transition while the wide band is hardly affected ; the latter becomes insulating only above @xmath46 .",
    "we have shown that , contrary to previous statements in the literature , the two - band hubbard model with distinct band widths @xmath47 and interaction parameters @xmath48 does in fact describe the occurrence of orbital - selective mott transitions , as seen experimentally in the ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2-system .",
    "this `` @xmath3-model '' can therefore be considered as a _",
    "minimal model _ for the theoretical description of osmts .",
    "we also showed that the method used in this paper , viz .",
    "high - precision qmc calculations at finite temperatures , is well - suited for the study of osmts , provided the correct high - frequency behavior of the self - energy is implemented with care and full convergence in the dmft cycle is established .",
    "the observables studied in this paper , revealing two consecutive mott transitions , are the spectral functions , the low - energy behavior of the self - energy , and the quasiparticle weights .",
    "the question concerning the _ order _ of the transitions at @xmath18 and @xmath19 is both interesting and important .",
    "the results presented here suggest that physical quantities , like the quasiparticle weights , display a _ jump _ at sufficiently low temperatures for @xmath49 , so that the first transition is likely of first order below @xmath38 .",
    "in contrast , these observables are _ continuous _ for the @xmath3-model at @xmath50 , as expected for a second - order transition . at present",
    "it would be premature , however , to make definite statements concerning the second transition , because high - precision qmc calculations are at present difficult ( since computationally costly ) in the relevant low - temperature regime and also because it is numerically difficult to distinguish a real second - order transition at @xmath51 from a narrow cross - over , eradiating possibly from a @xmath52 quantum critical point . in spite of these numerical uncertainties ,",
    "we wish to point out that the occurrence of a first - order transition at @xmath24 and a second - order transition at @xmath31 are physically plausible .",
    "a first - order transition for the narrow band at @xmath24 is exactly what one expects on the basis of experience with the mott transition in the single - band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the orbital - selective phase between @xmath24 and @xmath31 is characterized by itinerant electrons in the wide band , interacting with immobile ( localized ) electrons in the narrow band , which is essentially falicov - kimball physics .",
    "since the metal - insulator transition in the symmetric spinless falicov - kimball model is of second order ( hubbard - iii - like ) , the same scenario could apply to the @xmath3-model at @xmath31 .",
    "our results further show non - fermi - liquid behavior of the wide band for @xmath53 , which is again to be expected on the basis of the falicov - kimball analogy .",
    "the connection to the falicov - kimball model was recently also pointed out by biermann et al .",
    "@xcite ; for a discussion of non - fermi - liquid physics cf .  also @xcite .    as an outlook",
    ", we discuss several extensions of the present work . clearly , since the transition temperature at @xmath24 appears to be rather low @xmath54 , it is important to obtain results at even lower temperatures than were considered in this paper .",
    "the inclusion of spin flips remains an important problem . since the experimental system ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 has _",
    "three _ bands , two of which are physically equivalent , it may be worthwhile to study the osmts in a real 3-band - model .",
    "for comparison with the experimental situation , additional hybridization between the bands needs to be taken into account ; first results @xcite suggest that hybridization influences the osmt dramatically .",
    "since anisotropy is by definition important for the osmt , it is only consistent to take also orbital - dependent interaction strengths into account .",
    "since the experimental system is an antiferromagnetic insulator for small doping @xmath55 , it is important to extend the present work to include also magnetic phases . in conclusion , the study of osmts will doubtlessly remain exciting , yielding unexpected important results in the months to come .",
