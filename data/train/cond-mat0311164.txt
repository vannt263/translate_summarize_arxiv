    "the dynamics of adsorbed molecules is a fundamental issue in interface science @xcite and is also crucial in a large number of emerging technologies @xcite .",
    "adsorption at the solid - liquid interfaces arises , for instance , in many biological contexts involving protein deposition @xcite , in solutions or melts of synthetic macromolecules @xcite , in colloidal dispersions @xcite , and in the manufacture of self - assembly mono- and multi - layers @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of surfactant molecules @xcite , proteins @xcite and synthetic polymers @xcite confined to interfaces have identified different types of surface translational motions .",
    "one is in - surface self - diffusion of individual molecules , which has been investigated with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) methods @xcite .",
    "measured self - diffusivity at liquid - solid interfaces are much smaller than bulk values @xcite and similar to bulk values in liquid - gas cases @xcite .",
    "a second source of motion , exclusive to the liquid - fluid interface , is surface visco - elasticity .",
    "adsorbed surface phases possess compressibility and viscosities which govern the dynamics of the surface density waves .",
    "their relaxation kinetics have been intensively studied experimentally @xcite-@xcite and theoretically @xcite , with direct viscoelastic measurement @xcite and surface light scattering studies @xcite providing considerable support for current theories .    in this paper",
    "we explore another mechanism called _ bulk - mediated surface diffusion_. this mechanism arises at interfaces separating a liquid bulk phase and a second phase which may be either solid , liquid , or gaseous .",
    "whenever the adsorbed species are soluble in the liquid bulk , adsorption - desorption processes occur continuously .",
    "these processes generate surface displacement because desorbed molecules undergo fickian diffusion in the liquid s bulk , and are later re - adsorbed elsewhere .",
    "when this process is repeated many times , an effective diffusion results for the molecules on the surface .",
    "the importance of bulk - surface exchange in relaxing homogeneous surface density perturbations is experimentally well established @xcite .    here , unlike our previous work @xcite on the adsorption - desorption mechanism",
    ", we assume that the bulk is finite .",
    "the main goal of this work is the observation of an effective diffusion process at the interface @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate analytically its variance , @xmath6 , as a function of time and @xmath7 , the conditional probability of being on the surface at time @xmath8 since the particle arrived at @xmath9 , that we indicate as @xmath10 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model by means of a set of master equations and solve this system in fourier - laplace space .",
    "after that , we present a special case ( the bilayer case ) where we can obtain explicit analytical results for @xmath10 and @xmath6 .",
    "next we compare these theoretical results with numeric monte carlo simulations .",
    "moreover , we present results obtained by numerical inverse transformation of the equations for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the cases with more layers . in the last section we discuss the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "let us start with the problem of a particle making a random walk in a finite cubic lattice .",
    "the bulk is bounded in the @xmath13 direction where the particles can move from @xmath5 to @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions remain unbounded .",
    "the position of the walker is defined by a vector @xmath15 whose components are denoted by the integer numbers @xmath16 corresponding to the directions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath13 respectively .        in order to find the solution to the eq .",

    "( [ c6mat1 ] ) is @xmath47^{-1}.\\ ] ] we can show , by applying the dyson formula @xcite , that @xmath48    @xmath49    the solution for @xmath50 can be obtained analytically @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 the constant @xmath54 is obtained by exploiting the orthonormality relations for the @xmath55 functions given by @xmath56 while the completeness relation for the @xmath55 functions is written as @xmath57 the corresponding expression for @xmath54 is @xmath58    we are now able to find the statistical quantities which describe the diffusion problem over the surface .",
    "we are interested in the probability of finding a particle in the site @xmath59 at time @xmath8 given it was in @xmath60 at @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity is obtained by applying the inverse laplace transform on the @xmath61 matrix element .",
    "another direct measurable experimental magnitude @xcite is the variance ( @xmath6 ) of the probability distribution at time @xmath8 over the plane @xmath62 this quantity measures the particles dispersion over the surface and has a direct relation to the diffusion coefficient .",
    "when @xmath63 is known , the variance is calculated in the following manner @xmath64 in order to obtain this expression , we have assumed symmetric properties for the diffusion along the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , that is @xmath65 .",
    "finally the variance in the laplace space can be obtained as @xmath66 [ \\tilde{g}_{11}]\\mid_{k_x = k_y=0}.\\ ] ]",
    "so far , we have developed a general theory describing the important problem of the diffusion of a particle system over a surface which is surrounded by a bounded bulk .",
    "the expressions we found , are in the laplace space and the obtention of the inverse transform is usually a non trivial task .    in this section",
    "we restrict the problem to finding a particular solution , considering the case of a system of particles moving inside a bilayer , that is the space formed by the surface where we investigate the movement of the particles and a second layer . to obtain the @xmath63 ( @xmath10 )",
    ", we take the expression in eq .",

    ". then we obtain the inverse laplace transform .",
    "the result is @xmath69}.\\ ] ] this expression establishes that this probability is only a function of the temporal adsorption and desorption rates and does not depend on the temporal rates on the plane . from this equation ,",
    "we can also obtain the initial condition of the problem by evaluating eq .",
    "( [ c6pz1 ] ) at @xmath70 , obtaining @xmath71 .",
    "if we consider the long time limit , the expression has the following behavior @xmath72 this expression shows that , at this limit , the probability of finding the particle in the @xmath0 plane does not decay to zero ( as happens in unbounded systems @xcite ) , but it approaches an asymptotic value which is a function of the ratio of the temporal rates .    if the adsorption rate @xmath73 is large ( compared with the desorption rate @xmath23 ) , then the probability is large , the particles go back to the plane frequently . on the other hand , if the desorption rate is large , the particles go away from the surface and so the probability decays .",
    "these behaviors are shown and quantified by eq .",

    "( [ c6vari4 ] ) , ( [ c6rplano ] ) and ( [ c6rvol ] ) we can make the following observations .",
    "firstly , the variance can be decomposed into two contributions , one corresponding to the particle movement across the bulk and the other to the surface movement .",
    "the dependence of the variance on the time rates parallel to the surface is linear , while in these same relations , the adsorption and desorption rates enter in a more complicated way .",
    "the functional form obtained is similar for both movements ( which however are nonindependent ) .    for a large evolution time",
    ", the mean square distance or dispersion grows linear with time ; each diffusive process has its own slope or growing rate ( these slopes are associated with the diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "however , this is an expected behavior due to the model we are using .",
    "the other contributions are transient ones , that decay with a time constant @xmath77 , hence , the stronger the adsorption or desorption , the faster is the decay of these contributions .",
    "in this section we show the theoretical results , including some special numerical procedures , and make the comparison with monte carlo simulations . in all simulations",
    "we have fixed the following parameters : @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and have averaged over @xmath80 realizations .    in fig .",
    "[ f16 ] we present the theoretical - numerical ( that is using a computer program to calculate the inverse laplace transform @xcite ) , theoretical results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ c6pz1 ] ) and simulation results for the temporal evolution of the probability to find the system on the surface for the bilayer case . here",
    "we show the curves for two values of the desorption rate @xmath23 .",
    "as is apparent from the figure , there is excellent agreement between the theoretical and simulation results .",
    "such excellent agreement indicates that the numerical procedure for the obtention of the inverse laplace transform is a reliable tool , and that we can trust their results in those cases where analytical results are not accessible ( for instance the cases with larger number of layers that we will consider in the following ) . in fig .",
    "[ f26 ] , and again for the bilayer case , we depict for the variance ( @xmath6 ) , both theoretical and numerical results .",
    "again the agreement is excellent .    in figs .",
    "[ f36 ] and [ f46 ] we present the @xmath81 and the @xmath6 but now for a number of layers larger than two .",
    "here we compare the theoretical and numerical results again .",
    "we remark that the theoretical results were obtained fitting the inverse laplace transformation of eqs .",
    "( [ c6g0 ] ) and ( [ c6vari3 ] ) numerically .",
    "again we have found an excellent agreement between theoretical and simulation results .",
    "figures [ f56 ] , [ f66 ] and [ f76 ] correspond to an analysis for the asymptotic behavior of the finite system .",
    "figure [ f56 ] depicts the curve obtained for the @xmath11 as a function of @xmath82 ( the number of layers ) for three different and large observational times : @xmath83 .",
    "the insert shows that for these times , the system is well inside the asymptotic region . as can be seen from the figure , there is a maximum in the motion of the system . in other words",
    ", there is an  optimal \" number of layers for which the system can spread more rapidly . for a larger number of layers , the system converges to an asymptotic limit .",
    "this is reasonable due to the fact that the finiteness of the system tends to disappear .",
    "figure [ f66 ] depicts the same behavior as fig .",
    "[ f56 ] but now we have fixed an observational time ( @xmath84 ) and we have used the desorption rate ( @xmath23 ) as parameter .",
    "the figure also shows the maximum on the number of layers again but from this figure we can see that this maximum moves towards the lower layers as the desorption rate increases . the insert shows the time evolution of @xmath11 for large values of @xmath82 .",
    "we compare this behavior with the one corresponding to the infinite case @xcite . from this figure",
    "we can say that the finite system behaves , for the used parameters , as an infinite one when the number of layers is @xmath85 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath23 is increased , the maximum finally disappears as can be seen in fig .",
    "this figure shows two curves for two different @xmath23 for @xmath86 .",
    "the insert shows the @xmath10 for these desorption rates .",
    "finally we show a fitting of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath82 for a large evolution time . for fitting purposes we have used the following function @xmath87 where @xmath39 is a constant and @xmath88",
    "is the fitting parameter . in fig .",
    "[ f86 ] we depict the results obtained for @xmath88 as a function of @xmath82 .",
    "we observe two regions : for @xmath89 the particles describe a diffusion movement . in particular this behavior was shown for the bilayer model .",
    "the insert of the figure shows a zoom for a small number of layers , and for two different times .",
    "the linear behavior is apparent .",
    "a second region appears for @xmath90 where the movement results subdiffusive . for large",
    "@xmath82 the @xmath88 parameter approaches an asymptotic value equal to @xmath91 .",
    "this situation was predicted @xcite for infinite systems .",
    "we have studied the evolution of particles diffusing in a volume , but have analyzed the statistical properties of their evolution on a surface .",
    "the diffusion can be performed on the surface itself or across the bulk surrounding the surface . in this work",
    "we focus on the particle diffusion due to the movement across the bulk , that is we have considered the _ bulk mediated surface diffusion _ of the particles .",
    "the main feature of the bulk is its finiteness in one direction ( the axial one ) .",
    "the other directions are unbounded .",
    "this work complements a previous study @xcite in which we have analyzed the particle diffusion in a semi - infinite bulk .",
    "here we have presented a theoretical model based on a set of master equations which describe the movement of particles over a simple cubic lattice .",
    "this model is general in the sense that we include both kind of particle movement : on the surface and on the bulk .",
    "we solved this problem by using techniques of the laplace and fourier transformation and exploiting _",
    "dyson s formula_. it is worth remarking here that the model can describe the evolution of the system everywhere in the bulk , and the evolution of the system for all time .",
    "we particularize to the study over a single plane , i.e. the surface .",
    "we have obtained general solutions in the laplace space for the @xmath10 and the @xmath92 for any kind of bulk .    in order to find an analytical solution in space and time",
    ", we have particularized the problem to the bilayer case .",
    "the expressions obtained with this assumption were compared with monte carlo simulations , finding excellent agreement .",
    "moreover we were able to handle cases with more layers . in these cases , we have obtained the inverse laplace transform using numerical methods , and compared these results with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the agreement between both results are excellent again .",
    "as indicated above , the numerical procedure to obtain the inverse laplace transform is a reliable tool , and we have shown that we can trust their results in those cases where analytical results are not accessible .    finally we have studied the behavior of the spreading in the asymptotic region as a function of the number of layers of the system .",
    "we observed an  optimal `` number of layers for which @xmath6 reaches its maximum value .",
    "it is worth remarking here that this effect occurs in the limit of  strong adsorption '' , that is when the relation @xmath93 is small , and disappears in the limit of  weak adsorption \" , that is when @xmath94 is large .    a possible generalization of the present and the previous related work @xcite consists in considering the possibility of non markovian dynamics , and study the effect of such dynamics on the statistical features of the system .",
