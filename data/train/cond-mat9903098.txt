    "the sedimentation velocity @xmath9 of interacting colloidal particles depends both on the indirect hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) mediated by the suspending solvent , and on the microstructure of the suspension . in equilibrium ,",
    "the latter is determined by direct potential forces arising for example from the steric repulsion between the particles and from the electrostatic repulsion of overlapping double layers .",
    "different pair potentials @xmath10 lead to rather different microstructures , and this in turn strongly effects the sedimentation .",
    "it is well established by theories and experiments that the sedimentation velocity of a dilute suspension of monodisperse hard spheres is given by @xmath11 where @xmath1 is the particle volume fraction , and @xmath12 is the sedimentation velocity at infinite dilution @xcite . on the other hand , the long - ranged electrostatic repulsion occurring in suspensions of charged particles can give rise to a reduction in @xmath9 , as compared to a hard sphere dispersion at the same volume fraction @xcite . this decrease in @xmath9",
    "is mainly due to the cumulative backflow of displaced fluid , which becomes particularly effective because the probability of two or more charged particles coming close to each other is very small .",
    "conversely , hard spheres are effectively attracted to each other at small interparticle distances @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the radius of the spheres .",
    "this can be readily seen from the potential of mean force @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radial distribution function of hard spheres , which shows its maximum value at contact distance @xmath17 due to excluded volume effects .",
    "closely spaced particles are mutually exposed to the downflow of nearby fluid , dragged along with the sedimenting particles . consequently , the retardation from backflow is reduced , whereas the influence of near - field hi is enhanced for hard sphere suspensions .",
    "while the reduction in @xmath9 due to long - ranged electrostatic forces is known since many years , it was not realized until recently that , in particular for deionized charge - stabilized suspensions , @xmath9 can be significantly smaller than @xmath12 even for extremely small volume fractions as @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , in the past the effects of hi have been frequently considered to be negligible for dilute suspensions of charged particles @xcite .",
    "however , recent calculations have clearly demonstrated for these systems that hi is of importance at small @xmath1 not only for sedimentation @xcite , but also for short - time @xcite and long - time @xcite collective diffusion , and for long - time self - diffusion @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown theoretically for dilute suspensions of charged colloids without added electrolyte that @xmath9 follows a non - linear @xmath1-dependence of the parametric form @xcite @xmath19 the numerically calculated coefficient @xmath20 was found to be nearly independent of the ( effective ) particle charge @xmath5 , provided that @xmath5 is kept large enough to completely mask the hard core of the particles .",

    "we show now that these small differences in @xmath16 cause the large differences in the results for @xmath8 as illustrated in fig .",

    "( [ u.petsev ] ) does not predict the sedimentation velocity of weakly charged particles correctly .",

    "moreover , the relative differences in @xmath9 and @xmath172 become small in the parameter range where eq .",

    "furthermore , in eq .",
    "( [ u.phi.sqrt ] ) , the terms linear in @xmath1 are neglected against the term proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ u.zsmall.plot ] that this additional approximation becomes invalid already at small volume fractions , typically @xmath166 . for larger @xmath1 , the two results for @xmath0 in eq .",

    "( [ u.phi.sqrt ] ) start to deviate strongly , since the contributions to @xmath8 linear in @xmath1 ( especially the hard core contribution @xmath141 ) are no longer small compared to the term proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore also expect the @xmath31-scaling of @xmath30 according to eq .",
    "( [ u.phi.sqrt ] ) not to be measurable in a sedimentation experiment .",

    "this range of @xmath5-values is determined when the effective particle charge is subsequently lowered from large values @xmath173 , where @xmath30 scales like @xmath124 , to @xmath143 , where @xmath30 behaves linearly in @xmath1 according to eq .",
    "( [ u.hs ] ) . to demonstate the occurance of a @xmath31-dependence of @xmath30 , we have redrawn in fig .",
    "[ u.phisqrt.plot ] the rmsa - pa result from fig .",

    "such a @xmath31-dependence of @xmath8 might indeed be measurable in sedimentation experiments on dispersions with suitably chosen particle charges .",

    "[ u.phisqrt.plot ] is completely different from the prediction eq .",

    "obviously , these two parameters enter into our calculations mainly by determining the bjerrum length @xmath178 , which has a rather large value @xmath179 nm due to the small dielectric constant @xmath145 used in this work . as consequence ,",
    "also the ratio @xmath140 is comparatively large .",
    "this ratio determines together with @xmath5 the strength of the electrostatic repulsion between the particles .",

    "then , according to eqs .",

    "we have shown that the exponent @xmath90 and the value of the charge - independent parameter @xmath184 can be _ quantitatively _ understood in terms of a model of effective hard spheres of radius @xmath94 which depends on the volume fraction .",

    "this peculiar volume fraction dependence of @xmath8 derives from an expression given by petsev and denkov @xcite , when it is further assumed that the ionic strength in the system is mainly due to counterions .",
    "our numerical calculations reveal that both the original expression for @xmath8 given by petsev and denkov , and the derived expression showing the @xmath31-scaling of @xmath30 , are only valid for very small particle volume fractions , which we expect not to be accessible in conventional sedimentation experiments .",
