    "we note here that viable models exist in which @xmath0 and the electroweak gaugino masses are @xmath7 . contrary to common lore , such parameters are allowed despite many stringent constraints , including those arising from the lep @xmath3 width measurements .",
    "although the allowed parameter space is not large , such models have a number of interesting features : the susy @xmath1 problem is solved , the current discrepancy between theoretical and experimental values of @xmath2 can be reduced , and proton decay is suppressed .",
    "in addition , we will demonstrate that satisfactory electroweak symmetry breaking may be achieved and discuss how such models might arise in supergravity theories from a renormalizable hidden sector .",
    "an important and unambiguous prediction of such models is the observation of neutralinos and charginos at lep ii .",
    "we first discuss the bounds from @xmath3 decays . because the @xmath0 parameter and electroweak gaugino masses enter chargino and neutralino mass matrices , one might expect that when these parameters are in the gev range , charginos and neutralinos are light and in conflict with the bounds on @xmath3 decay widths .",
    "we will see , however , that in some of this region of parameter space , charginos are sufficiently massive and neutralinos are sufficiently decoupled from the @xmath3 that these bounds may be satisfied .",

    "we assume that the charginos and neutralinos are the standard mixtures of electroweak gauginos and the higgsinos of the two higgs doublets .",

    "the current bound on chargino masses from lep measurements is 47 gev @xcite .",
    "this bound requires no additional assumptions , as charginos remain coupled to the @xmath3 for all values of the parameters .",
    "we see , however , that for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , both charginos have mass @xmath17 and avoid the bound . with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , as @xmath9 ( @xmath0 ) increases , one chargino mass eigenvalue drops by the see - saw mechanism , and when @xmath9 ( @xmath0 ) @xmath20 , the chargino mass limit is violated for all @xmath21 . however , for @xmath22 , the parameters @xmath15 satisfy the chargino mass bound .",

    "it is clear , then , that a discussion of light neutralinos requires a detailed analysis of their couplings to the @xmath3 boson .",
    "the @xmath3 width constraints are therefore considerably more complicated for neutralinos than for charginos , and we will discuss them in two stages .",

    "the production of @xmath102 then gives a spectacular single photon signal , and the bound on its rate can be significantly improved . to estimate this new bound , we reexamine the data of ref .  @xcite . in that event sample , the dominant standard model background , @xmath103 , is expected to produce only @xmath104 events with photons passing the cut @xmath105 .",

    "another important refinement is to include the data taken above @xmath36 .",
    "as the process @xmath112 is suppressed only by phase space , the boundary of the allowed region defined by this constraint can be expected to be very sensitive to deviations in @xmath113 from @xmath36 .",

    "off - diagonal radiative corrections that mix the light states can be important , however , as they give a dirac mass that lifts the tree level zero in eq .",
    "( [ neutmass ] ) @xcite .",

    "the chargino mass is lowered by the deviation from @xmath125 , but remains above 70 gev .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath126 throughout almost all of the allowed region and grows beyond @xmath17 as @xmath0 and @xmath9 increase in the allowed region , so the branching ratio for the decay @xmath127 is highly suppressed @xcite .    another possible constraint on the light higgsino - gaugino window is from the relic dark matter density .",
    "as the lsp is mostly higgsino , the dominant annihilation channel is through @xmath128-channel @xmath3 to light fermion pairs .",
    "the higgsino-@xmath3 coupling is necessarily suppressed in order to avoid the invisible width bound from @xmath3 decay .",
    "this generally leads to an overproduction of primordial higgsinos . using the non - relativistic approximation for the freeze out density and the annihilation cross section for a pure higgsino state given in ref .",

    "below we discuss some consequences of extending the approximate @xmath143 symmetry to other sectors of the mssm .",
    "such an approximate symmetry in fact arises accidentally in certain types of hidden sector susy breaking scenarios as discussed below .",
    "the allowed window requires @xmath144 .",
    "let us therefore reexamine the lower bound on @xmath145 from the requirement that the top yukawa coupling , @xmath146 , remain perturbative to high scales .",

    "neglecting susy , electroweak , and higher loop corrections , one has a @xmath149 correction to the tree level result , and taking @xmath150 gev , we find the constraint @xmath151 .",
    "however , including the one - loop susy qcd corrections @xcite , we find an additional few percent correction ( for a nonvanishing gluino mass ) whose sign depends on the various susy parameters .",

    "the proton decay rate is then suppressed in this limit at one - loop by @xmath229 in the allowed window .",
    "if the gluino is massive , gluino exchange could then dominate the decay rate if there are flavor changing squark masses .",
    "finally , let us consider a possible theoretical motivation for the light higgsino - gaugino window . in hidden sector models ,",
    "susy breaking is transmitted to the visible sector by gravitational strength interactions . with a renormalizable hidden sector ,",
    "in which susy breaking remains in the flat space limit , the dynamical scale , @xmath230 , of the hidden sector gauge group , and the hidden sector scalar expectation values , @xmath231 , are of the order of the intrinsic susy breaking scale , @xmath232 gev .",
    "this allows an expansion of the operators which couple the visible and hidden sectors in powers of @xmath233 . in the rigid supersymmetric limit ,",
    "the dimension two soft terms arise from @xmath234 term operators of the form @xmath235 and @xmath236 @xcite , where @xmath231 are any hidden sector fields and @xmath237 is a visible sector field . with @xmath238",
    ", we then have @xmath239 .",
    "note that these dimension two terms arise even without hidden sector singlets .",
    "the dimension three gaugino masses arise from the dependence of a visible sector gauge kinetic function on a hidden sector singlet @xmath240 , which does not transform under any gauge symmetry , @xmath241 visible sector @xmath142 terms arise from @xmath234 term operators @xmath242 , where @xmath243 results from the visible sector yukawa couplings @xmath244 .",
    "terms are real .",
    "independent of their magnitude , @xmath142 terms therefore do not contribute to the susy @xmath1 problem with a renormalizable hidden sector .",
    "] likewise , the @xmath0 term arises from operators of the form @xmath245 @xcite .",
    "if the hidden sector singlets have @xmath246 components @xmath247 , then all the dimensionful parameters of the mssm can be @xmath248 .",
    "however , it is possible that the hidden sector singlets participate in the supersymmetry breaking only radiatively so that @xmath249 , where @xmath250 is a hidden sector singlet yukawa coupling",
    ". all the dimension three soft terms and @xmath0 are then automatically suppressed by @xmath251 .",
    "term can also arise from an @xmath252 dependence of a hidden sector gauge kinetic function @xmath253 @xcite .",
    "for a renormalizable hidden sector with @xmath254 the resulting @xmath0 term is very small .",
    "however , a non - renormalizable hidden sector with @xmath255 gives @xmath256 .",
    "the scenario discussed by farrar and masiero in which all the dimension three terms but @xmath0 essentially vanish @xcite is therefore realizable with a non - renormalizable hidden sector without singlets and with scalar expectation values much less than @xmath257 .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath0 term therefore distinguishes between the renormalizable and non - renormalizable hidden sector motivations for light gauginos . ]",
    "inclusion of supergravity interactions does not modify this conclusion .",
    "the smallness of the dimension three terms in such a scenario leads to the approximate @xmath143 discussed above .",
    "this approximate symmetry is not imposed by hand but simply arises accidentally as a result of the hidden sector outlined above .",
    "notice that this motivation for the window requires the gluino also to be light @xcite .",
    "models with radiatively coupled singlets have in fact been constructed @xcite and until recently were the only known renormalizable models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking with singlets @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that a renormalizable hidden sector with radiatively coupled singlets automatically leads to models that can fall in the light higgsino - gaugino window .",
    "at present there exists a small region of supersymmetric parameter space in which @xmath0 and the electroweak gaugino masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 are in the few gev range .",
    "this window has a number of interesting consequences : 1 ) the susy @xmath1 problem can be significantly reduced , 2 ) the discrepancy in @xmath2 can be substantially reduced if the right - handed stop is light , and 3 ) proton decay is suppressed .",
    "the mass of the lightest higgs is generated almost entirely radiatively since @xmath258 , and requires a fairly heavy stop to exceed current bounds .",
    "( this must be the left - handed stop if a light right - handed stop is required for @xmath2 . )",
    "radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is generally difficult in the allowed window with minimal particle content , but can be accommodated .",
    "in particular , a heavy gluino or intermediate scale right - handed neutrino can allow radiative symmetry breaking .",
    "renormalizable hidden sectors with radiatively coupled singlets automatically give models that can fall in the allowed window .",
    "most importantly , this window predicts that two neutralino states are light , two are roughly degenerate with the @xmath3 , and both charginos are roughly degenerate with the @xmath4 .",
    "all of these particles can not escape detection at lep ii .",
