    "the discovery of a sequence of spherically symmetric solutions of su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills theory by bartnik and mckinnon @xcite came as a surprise , since the very existence of globally regular solutions was unexpected .",
    "these bartnik - mckinnon solutions are asymptotically flat , and they are characterized by the node number @xmath0 of their purely magnetic gauge field .    to every regular spherically symmetric bartnik - mckinnon solution there exists a corresponding family of black hole solutions with regular event horizon @xcite .",
    "since these black hole solutions possess non - trivial non - abelian fields outside their event horizon , they represent counterexamples to the `` no - hair '' conjecture .",
    "they are hairy black holes carrying yang - mills hair .    instead of black holes",
    "we here consider wormholes and address the question , whether we can endow these wormholes in a similar way with yang - mills fields , and thus with hair .",
    "the counterpart of the schwarzschild solution , which corresponds to the hairless solution in the case of the hairy black holes , will now be the ellis wormhole @xcite , while the hairy wormholes will have non - trivial non - abelian fields threading their throat .",
    "the ellis wormhole is based on the presence of a phantom field , i.e. , a scalar field with a reversed sign in front of its kinetic term @xcite .",
    "such a phantom field provides the required violation of the energy conditions , necessary to obtain traversable wormholes in einstein gravity @xcite . nowadays",
    "phantom fields are ubiquitous in cosmology , since they could explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "wormholes with phantom fields have been studied in numerous respects ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , including the presence of wormholes inside stars and neutron stars @xcite , or the study of their shadow @xcite .",
    "however , wormholes can also be obtained without phantom fields by allowing higher curvature terms in the action @xcite or by coupling matter non - minimally to einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "in fact , wormholes with non - minimally coupled yang - mills fields were constructed in @xcite .",
    "but these solutions possess only a simple wu - yang type gauge field .",
    "thus they correspond to wormhole solutions carrying magnetic charge .",
    "the possibility of finding sequences of wormholes threaded by genuine non - abelian fields was not explored , however . instead",
    ", black wormholes were introduced , whose throat is hidden behind an event horizon .",
    "the wormholes we consider here also allow for charged wu - yang type solutions .",
    "these correspond to embedded abelian solutions , where the gauge field function is identically zero .",
    "when the gauge field is pure gauge , on the other hand , the ellis wormhole is recovered .",
    "our interest focusses , however , on wormholes with non - trivial gauge field functions , which can be labeled by a node number @xmath0 , and we consider only symmetric wormholes .",
    "in particular , we analyze the behavior of odd-@xmath0 and even-@xmath0 wormholes , and demonstrate that the even-@xmath0 solutions approach smoothly the bartnik - mckinnon solutions , when the gravitational coupling tends to infinity .",
    "in contrast , the odd-@xmath0 solutions exhibit a singular behavior in this limit in the vicinity of the throat , while outside the throat region they also approach bartnik - mckinnon solutions ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "we also discuss the limit @xmath3 , where the analogy with hairy black holes becomes particularly apparent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the action , the anstze and the equations of motion .",
    "we analyze the wormhole properties and discuss the violations of the energy conditions .",

    "we present our numerical results .",
    "we first discuss the probe limit , and then present the gravitating solutions . in particular , we discuss the solutions themselves , their throat geometry , their global charges , and their dependence on the coupling constant .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the limiting behavior of the wormholes for large coupling and for large node number .",

    "[ fig8a ] for the gauge field function @xmath143 of the solutions with @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 nodes and values of @xmath188 and 15 . here",
    "the gauge field function must assume the value zero at the throat .",
    "this leads to a sudden sharp decrease of the functions near the throat .",
    "it is clear , that the huge derivatives associated with such a sharp decrease imply a severe numerical challenge .",
    "however , away from the vicinity of the throat the higher odd-@xmath0 solutions also approach the bartnik - mckinnon solutions , as seen in the figure .",
    "in particular , the @xmath193 solution appoaches the @xmath194 bartnik - mckinnon solution , and the @xmath195 solution the @xmath196 bartnik - mckinnon solution .",

    "with increasing @xmath57 the kretschmann scalar increases dramatically at @xmath86 , indicating that a curvature singularity is approached .",
    "let us finally address the limiting behavior of the wormhole solutions for fixed values of @xmath57 , when the node number @xmath0 increases , @xmath3 .",
    "here we must distinguish two cases .",
    "when @xmath197 , a u(1 ) wormhole solution with unit charge exists , that can be embedded into su(2 ) , as discussed earlier in section [ exact ] .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath198 there is no such embedded wormhole solution .    for fixed @xmath57 and increasing node number @xmath0",
    ", the non - abelian wormhole solutions converge towards the corresponding abelian solution with the same @xmath57 , as long as @xmath197 .",
    "this convergence is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the metric functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the wormhole solutions with @xmath0 nodes , @xmath132 and @xmath147 . for small values of @xmath57",
    "this convergence is very fast , as seen in the figure . at @xmath199",
    "the abelian solution becomes singular in these coordinates .",
    "to understand the limiting behavior of the wormhole solutions for @xmath198 , let us recall the limiting behavior of the bartnik - mckinnon solutions .",
    "with increasing node number @xmath200 , @xmath201 , these approach the embedded extremal abelian reissner - nordstrm black hole solution with unit charge in an outer region @xmath202 , where @xmath5 is the schwarzschild - like radial coordinate .",
    "however , in the inner region @xmath203 the bartnik - mckinnon solutions approach a non - abelian limiting solution .",
    "let us therefore look at the behavior of the non - abelian wormhole solutions for @xmath198 in schwarzschild - like coordinates , and compare their limiting behavior for @xmath3 with the one of the bartnik - mckinnon solutions .",
    "the schwarzschild - like metric functions @xmath204 and @xmath126 of the wormhole solutions with node numbers @xmath132 and several values of @xmath205 are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] in these coordinates .",
    "these figures also contain the respective metric functions of the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution with unit charge .",
    "we observe , that the metric functions of the wormholes converge towards the metric functions of the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution in the outer region @xmath206 .",
    "this is not surprising , since in this region the wormhole solutions converge towards the bartnik - mckinnon solutions , which themselves converge to the extremal abelian reissner - nordstrm solution with unit charge .    in the inner region @xmath207",
    "two different limiting solutions are approached for a fixed value of @xmath57 .",
    "one limiting solution is associated with the even-@xmath0 wormholes and another one with the odd-@xmath0 wormholes .",
    "these limiting solutions are genuinely non - abelian .",
    "they differ from each other and from the limiting non - abelian solution of the bartnik - mckinnon solutions close to the throat .    for the mass of the limiting solutions such",
    "a distinction is not necessary , however , since only the asymptotic behavior is relevant . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7a ] , the limiting scaled mass of the wormhole solutions obtained for @xmath3 corresponds to the scaled mass of the respective abelian solution when @xmath197 , and to unity when @xmath198 . at @xmath208",
    "the mass is continuous .",
    "thus the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution plays an as prominent role for the non - abelian wormholes as for the globally regular non - abelian solutions and their associated hairy black holes . similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] shows that the limiting value of the scaled scalar charge corresponds to the scaled scalar charge of the respective abelian solution when @xmath197 .",
    "the scaled scalar charge vanishes when @xmath198 , in accordance with the fact that the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution has no scalar charge .",
    "we have investigated einstein - yang - mills wormholes supported by a phantom field .",
    "the solutions are spherically symmetric and possess two asymptotically flat regions .",
    "the non - abelian gauge field is described in terms of the wu - yang ansatz which contains a single function @xmath143 .",
    "for @xmath209 the gauge field is trivial and the ellis wormhole is recovered , whereas for @xmath210 a set of embedded abelian wormhole solutions is obtained .",
    "our main interest here has focussed on genuine non - abelian wormhole solutions , where the gauge field function @xmath143 possesses a number of nodes , which we have labelled by the integer @xmath0 . already in the probe limit , where the gauge field decouples from the metric",
    ", a sequence of non - trivial solutions with @xmath0 nodes is found .",
    "the background metric of these solutions is the metric of the ellis wormhole .",
    "we recall , that in the background of a flat spacetime no such non - trivial non - abelian solutions are possible .    in order to take the backreaction into account ,",
    "the coupled set of einstein - yang - mills - scalar equations has been solved . for a given value of the throat size and a given node number @xmath0 , a family of wormhole solutions emerges from the solution obtained in the probe limit , as the coupling to gravity",
    "is increased from zero .",
    "this family of solutions changes smoothly with the coupling constant .",
    "we consider these solutions as wormhole solutions with non - abelian hair .",
    "the wormhole solutions with an even number of nodes possess always only a single throat . in contrast",
    ", the wormhole solutions with an odd number of nodes possess a double - throat with an equator inbetween , when their size is sufficiently small . in that case",
    "they also aquire a non - vanishing surface gravity at their double - throat .",
    "since the equations depend only on the ratio @xmath57 of the gravitational coupling @xmath85 and the size parameter @xmath211 of the throat , an increase in @xmath57 can be interpreted as an increase of the gravitational coupling or a decrease of the throat size .",
    "the limit @xmath133 may thus be viewed as the limit of vanishing throat size .",
    "we have noted , that this limit is different for non - abelian wormhole solutions with an even or odd number of nodes .",
    "the even solutions with @xmath212 nodes converge smoothly towards the bartnik - mckinnon solutions with @xmath200 nodes in the limit , while the spacetime splits up into two disjoint asymptotically flat parts .",
    "the odd solutions with @xmath213 nodes also converge towards the bartnik - mckinnon solutions with @xmath200 nodes , however this convergence is not smooth at the throat .",
    "instead a curvature singularity develops at the throat in this limit .",
    "the convergence of the wormhole solutions to the bartnik - mckinnon solutions is also seen in the mass of the solutions .",
    "the bartnik - mckinnon solutions themselves are known to converge towards a limiting solution for large node number @xmath214 .",
    "this limiting solution consists of the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution with unit charge in the outer region and a genuine non - abelian solution in the inner region , where both regions are joined at the extremal horizon .",
    "here we find a related behavior for the wormhole solutions in the limit of large node number @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath197 the non - abelian solutions converge to the corresponding embedded abelian wormhole . for @xmath198 , on the other hand , no embedded abelian wormhole solutions exist . here",
    "- analogous to the bartnik - mckinnon case - the non - abelian solutions converge towards the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution with unit charge in the outer region and a genuine non - abelian solution in the inner region , where again both regions are joined at the extremal horizon .",
    "the analogy is even closer for the limiting behaviour of the hairy black holes . here - in the region outside their horizon -",
    "the hairy black holes converge towards the non - extremal abelian reissner - nordstrm solution as long as their horizon is sufficiently large . for horizon sizes smaller than the extremal reissner - nordstrm horizon , however ,",
    "they converge towards the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution with unit charge in the outer region and a genuine non - abelian solution in the inner region , with both regions joined at the extremal horizon .",
    "the wormhole solutions studied here possess the reflection symmetry @xmath215",
    ". it will be interesting to consider also the general non - symmetric case .",
    "concerning their stability we note that the ellis wormhole is unstable @xcite .",
    "likewise , the bartnik - mckinnon solutions and their associated hairy black holes are unstable @xcite .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the hairy wormhole solutions will inherit these instabilties and thus be unstable as well .",
    "regular einstein - yang - mills solutions need not be spherically symmetric .",
    "indeed , static solutions are known , which possess only axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "these solutions give rise to families of static black holes , whose horizon is only axially symmetric @xcite , showing that israel s theorem does not generalize in the presence of non - abelian fields .",
    "we plan to construct the analogous set of hairy wormhole solutions , which should be static and possess a throat that is only axially symmetric",
    ". presumably , also non - abelian wormholes with throats possessing only discrete symmetries may be found .",
    "einstein - yang - mills black holes may also rotate @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to construct the corresponding rotating einstein - yang - mills wormholes . here as a first step rotating phantom field wormholes should be obtained .",
    "these could then be employed to find the hairy solutions in the probe limit and subsequently generalize them to include backreaction .",
