    "in the redshift interval @xmath10 most ionizing photons in the universe are thought to originate in popii stars in normal ( @xmath11 ) galaxies @xcite . for reionization calculations at @xmath12 photons from lower mass halos",
    "should be taken into account @xcite , whereas at @xmath13 active galactic nuclei start to play a dominant role @xcite . the fact that the metagalactic uv field peaks at @xmath14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and ref .",
    "therein ) points to a peak in the galactic star formation ( sf ) rate at such redshifts ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a major uncertainty in modeling the effect of this sf on the thermal state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is the value of the escape fraction @xmath1 of ionizing uv photons , which is a function of redshift , and galaxy type and mass .",
    "best observational estimates of @xmath1 come from the detailed multiwaveband studies of the local universe .",
    "@xcite find that less than @xmath15 of ionizing photons from low - redshift starburst galaxies escape into the igm .",
    "more recently , for several local starburst galaxies , @xcite estimate @xmath16 , noting that inclusion of dust will further reduce @xmath1 , and @xcite find @xmath17 for another local starburst .",
    "the situation is markedly different at @xmath18 , where the lyman continuum ( lyc ) detection points at much higher @xmath1 @xcite . by comparing the direct observations of the lyc from galaxies to the mean cosmic uvb intensity , @xcite",
    "conclude that the average @xmath1 increases from @xmath19 at @xmath20 to @xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "most theoretical estimates of @xmath1 to date have been based on models with a smooth distribution of gas @xcite or semi - analytical models with expanding shells and superbubbles in a disk galaxy @xcite . in this letter we present ab initio calculations of the energy - dependent @xmath1 of ionizing radiation from sf regions in proto - galaxies found in numerical simulations at five different redshifts from @xmath6 to 3.8 .",
    "we define @xmath23 simply as a fraction of photons of energy @xmath24 which reach a shell of radius @xmath25 around a given source ; by definition @xmath26 .",
    "we postprocess high - resolution simulation datasets with radiative transfer ( rt ) on nested grids , with the maximum grid resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "each galaxy contains from several hundred to several thousand distinct stellar sources representing individual , young sf regions .",
    "our interstellar gas distribution is extremely clumpy due to an array of physical processes including feedback from sf .",
    "we also estimate the effect of the dynamical expansion of hii regions on the escape of ionizing photons .",
    "to compute the escape of ionizing radiation from sf regions , we use an extension of the fully threaded transport engine ( ftte , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to point sources .",
    "this new module was previously briefly introduced in the comparison study by @xcite .",
    "it extends the adaptive ray - splitting scheme of @xcite to a model with variable grid resolution .",
    "sources of radiation can be hosted by cells of any level of refinement , although usually in cosmological applications sources are sitting on the deepest level of refinement ( fig .",
    "[ radialgeometry ] ) . around each point source",
    "we build a system of @xmath28 radial rays which split either when we move further away from the source , or when we enter a refined cell , and @xmath29 is the angular resolution level .",
    "once a radial ray is refined it stays refined , even if we leave the high spatial resolution patch , until even further angular refinement is necessary .",
    "all ray segments are stored as elements of their host cells , and for actual transport we just follow these interconnected data structures accumulating photo - reaction number and energy rates in each cell . with multiple sources ,",
    "we add the rates from all sources before updating the time - dependent rate network using the chemistry solver from @xcite , and the global timestep is chosen such that each species abundance does not change by more than @xmath30 .    with a small ( @xmath31 ) number of star particles we can compute a full ray geometry separately for each source . for a large number of sources ( @xmath32 ) the algorithm allows construction of trees of sources in which individual tree nodes are treated as a single source far from their origin .",
    "our algorithm shares many common ideas with the recent rt module of the cosmological structure formation code enzo implemented by @xcite to study feedback from pop iii stars and , in fact , is a basis of an independently developed radiation hydrodynamics module of enzo which we will introduce elsewhere .",
    "we use results of high - resolution galaxy formation simulations in a standard @xmath0cdm cosmology done with a significantly improved version of the treesph code described by @xcite  some detail is given in @xcite .",
    "the simulations invoke the formation of discrete star `` particles '' , which represent a population of stars born at the same time in accordance with a given initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "for the purpose of this work we focus on two ( proto- ) galaxies , k15 and k33 , which at @xmath33=0 become typical disk galaxies of @xmath34= 245 and 180 @xmath35 , respectively . the rt calculation",
    "are performed at five different redshifts , @xmath2 , 3.6 , 3.4 , 2.95 , and 2.39 , for `` normal '' resolution simulations , and at the first three for `` high '' resolution ones ( 8 times higher mass resolution , twice better force resolution ) . for galaxy k15 we also vary the strength of supernova feedback ( table 1 ) .",
    "total particle numbers range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ; star ( and sph ) particle masses are @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 , for normal and high resolution simulations , respectively .    lccccccc simulation & resolution & feedback & z=3.8 & 3.6 & 3.4 & 2.95 & 2.39 +   + k15 - 1 - 8 & normal & @xmath41normal & & 347 & & 1000 & 560 + k15 - 06 - 8 & normal & normal & 431 & 560 & 595 & 1161 & 596 + k15 - 06 - 64 & high & normal & 5061 & 5248 & 6005 & & +   + k33 - 06 - 8 & normal & normal & 306 & 340 & 390 & 337 & 144 + k33 - 06 - 64 & high & normal & 2566 & 3122 & 3389 & & +    radiative transfer is computed on top of a nested data structure containing 3d distributions of physical variables .",
    "to create such a structure from the sph simulation datasets , for each galaxy we cut out a @xmath42 box centered on the galaxy and projected this box onto a @xmath43 uniform grid .",
    "we then subdivided every base grid cell which contains more than @xmath44 sph particles , and continued this process of subdivision recursively so that no cell contains more than @xmath45 gas particles .",
    "in the ( normal resolution ) galaxy k15 - 1 - 8 at @xmath4 there are 347 stellar sources younger than @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ three ] ) .",
    "the birth times of particles are distributed almost uniformly over the span of @xmath47 , corresponding to a nearly constant star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath48 . to compute the stellar uv luminosity function for this and other galaxies ,",
    "we use a population synthesis package starburst 1999 @xcite with continuous sf at a constant rate @xmath48 distributed among 347 stars . for other galaxies and at other redshifts",
    "the sfr per particle is adjusted to account for the actual number of stars produced in the past @xmath47 , and the specific ( per unit spectrum ) luminosity is distributed uniformly among all stars in the volume .",
    "we assume a triple - interval kroupa imf with indices ( 0.5,1.2,1.7 ) above the mass boundaries @xmath49 , respectively , a supernova cut - off at @xmath50 , a black hole cut - off @xmath51 , and solar metallicity .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ three ] .",
    "the treesph code assumes the uvb of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) with self - shielding in regions in which the mean free path of lyman - limit photons is less than 1 .",
    "in addition to radiative heating and cooling and the hydrodynamical @xmath52 term , some heating originates from shock dissipation which we include in the following way .",
    "after we project the 3d hydro fields onto the grids , in each cell we apply the uniform uvb with the self - shielding correction and compute the amount of additional heating needed to keep the temperature of that cell constant ( thermal equilibrium without sources ) .",
    "we then switch on the stellar sources retaining the extra heating term , and evolve simultaneously the equations of point source transfer and non - equilibrium chemistry to @xmath53 . with continuous sf and constant uv luminosities , all",
    "@xmath1 reach a plateau after the first few . in this paper",
    "all results are presented at @xmath54 at which point we assume convergence .",
    "direct momentum transfer from uv photons to the interstellar / intergalactic gas is negligible @xcite .",
    "however , heating and ionization by stellar photons creates pressure gradients that drive expansion of the hii regions into the surrounding gas .",
    "the physics of expansion has been studied in detail in 1d @xcite , 2d @xcite , and recently 3d @xcite radiation hydrodynamics simulations . without coupling rt to the hydro code",
    ", we can not model this expansion self - consistently .",
    "however , we can mimic its effect by lowering the density in the giant hii region around the starburst region which will ease the escape of uv photons .",
    "we use the results from section 3.1 of @xcite which lists the `` initial strmgren radius '' @xmath55 ( 1 myr after the burst ) and the `` final strmgren sphere '' @xmath56 ( 4 myr after the burst ; at this time the uv luminosity declines rapidly ) as a function of the local density and the ionizing source luminosity .    for each source",
    "we use the initial gas density @xmath57 of the its host cell to find @xmath55 and @xmath56 and then modify the density of each cell inside @xmath56 by @xmath58 , provided that the initial density of that cell @xmath59 . for @xmath60",
    "the expanding shell hits a denser region , and without a full hydrodynamical calculation one can not predict whether this will lead to expansion or compression of the denser region , which explains our condition . therefore , for a given source our density correction is anisotropic which seems entirely realistic for an hii front expansion in an inhomogeneous medium .    for such large galaxies",
    ", we do not expect our results to change significantly if a fully self - consistent hydro / rt approach is used , as the energetic and momentum effects of ionization fronts are negligible compared to the effects of snii explosions , shocks etc . which are already included into our models , resulting in a very clumpy interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "however , the radiative feedback would also smooth some of the small - scale structure by raising the jeans mass which is especially important in lower mass galaxies , an effect which we plan to include in our future simulations .",
    "fig .  [ escapefraction ] shows spectral dependence of @xmath1 at @xmath61 in each model , averaged over all sources .",
    "all @xmath1 have been corrected for the boundary of the volume . for individual sources",
    "the escape of photoionizing radiation is similar to a phase transition : it is very sensitive to conditions at the source and therefore can vary by a sizable factor for the same galaxy over the course of its evolution .",
    "we find that while there are variations among the models , the escape fractions tend to decrease with lower redshift , reflecting the fact that with time more gas cools into the higher density clouds , as well the declining sfr at @xmath62 . with normal feedback in both galaxies @xmath1 at the lyman edge drops from @xmath63 at @xmath2 to @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "not surprisingly , in all our models @xmath1 of photons capable of doubly ionizing helium is very low , due to the softness of stellar radiation .",
    "the escape fraction of photons capable of single he ionization is comparable at all redshifts to that of h - ionizing photons .    increasing sn feedback in k15 evacuates more gas from the vicinity of the sf regions leading to a threefold rise in @xmath1 at @xmath4 .",
    "lower local gas densities translate into a @xmath64 reduction in the sfr ( table 1 ) . at @xmath65 , a denser environment near the sources",
    "produces a much smaller difference in the sfr and @xmath1 , when we increase the strength of feedback , and , at @xmath6 , @xmath1 actually drops by @xmath66 as a larger fraction of gas swept - up by the shocks stays in the vicinity of the sf regions .",
    "next we compare our normal and high resolution results , at @xmath67 , and find a good agreement between the two .",
    "we see it as an additional test of our algorithm , since other properties of the two sets of simulations ( sfr , etc . )",
    "also match .",
    "since our choice of distributing sf over the @xmath46 youngest stars is somewhat arbitrary , in galaxy k15 - 1 - 8 we also experimented with the same amount of sf distributed over all stars younger than @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "ideally , these young stars would produce most of the ionizing uv photons . since we do not calculate transfer and hydro simultaneously",
    ", we feel that applying continuous sf with the constant rate is a better computational approach than assuming instantaneous sf which will have no lasting effect on the thermal state of the igm after few myrs . with continuous sf",
    "we expect our results to converge as we increase the number of star particles .",
    "the results at @xmath68 and @xmath47 are in fact very close to each other at all three redshifts ( fig .  [ escapefraction ] ) , whereas the @xmath69 results are somewhat off , likely related to the small number of sources used to represent the sf in this latter case .",
    "the dashed lines in k15 - 06 - 8 in fig .",
    "[ escapefraction ] show the energy - dependent @xmath1 at @xmath61 corrected for the hii region expansion . at most redshifts expansion",
    "raises @xmath1 by @xmath70 , although at @xmath65 @xmath1 jumps by more than a factor of two .",
    "further analysis shows that most of this change can be attributed to removal of the gas from the highest refinement level cells which are hosting the sources , not the surrounding cells .    in fig .",
    "[ radial ] we show how @xmath1 changes with distance from sources in galaxy k15 - 1 - 8 at @xmath4 .",
    "a large fraction of photons reaches the radius @xmath71 . as we do not have any reliable information on gas clumping on sub - resolution scales at these redshifts ,",
    "the effective radius of absorption is not firmly established at this point . in our current models",
    "most absorption occurs within few hundreds pc of each star particle , well inside the virial radius of @xmath7245 kpc . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the proto - galaxy consists of several star forming regions as well as a significant amount of the intergalactic hi , all of which account for some fractional absorption beyond @xmath73 .    in this study we neglected the effect of dust extinction .",
    "@xcite point out that in the case of a smooth ism attenuation by dust can reduce @xmath1 by a factor of few . for a clumpy ism at high redshifts the magnitude of dust attenuation should be much lower , particularly that most ionizing photons are produced in star bursts , as opposed to a quiescent disk .",
    "in conclusion , our models with exact ionizing continuum rt around a large number of sf regions in young protogalaxies show a monotonic decline in @xmath1 of ionizing photons from higher to lower redshifts . with the normal feedback strength @xmath1 at the lyman edge drops from @xmath3 at @xmath4 to @xmath5 at @xmath6 . at higher redshifts",
    "sf on average occurs at slightly lower densities resulting in easier escape of uv photons into the igm .",
    "this result agrees well with the observational findings of @xcite on redshift evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "note that although the two galaxies in our study have a mass ratio of @xmath74 , their @xmath1 are very similar .",
    "one could suggest that perhaps , once star formation begins , it is the physical conditions in the clumpy gas clouds that determine the escape of uv photons , rather than the overall properties of their host galaxies .",
    "however , one would need a much larger statistical sample to test this speculation . in our next paper",
    "we will further examine the role of the fine structure of the clumpy ism in the escape of ionizing photons , as well as the importance of hydrodynamical effects .",
    "ar would like to thank mika juvela and eric lentz for valuable discussions on numerical methods , as well as the hospitality of the dark cosmology centre at the university of copenhagen .",
