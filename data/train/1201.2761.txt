    "as observational instruments have developed , systematic studies of stellar clusters have revealed many low - mass populations of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars in massive star - forming regions .",
    "it has been found that most stars are born in groups or clusters , not in isolated regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar clusters provide a tool for investigating stellar evolution , because they are considered to constitute a natural sample of coeval stars at the same distance and with the same chemical composition .",
    "young clusters appear to be a snapshot of stellar evolution over a wide range of masses .",
    "however , a careful study of the orion nebula cluster @xcite has revealed that the younger stars ( @xmath3 0.3 myr ) are clustered towards the center of the trapezium cluster ( a projected distance of @xmath3 0.3 pc from @xmath5c ori ) , while the older stars are widely distributed .",
    "this indicates that star formation has recently occurred in the center of the cluster and that star formation with a low rate has taken place over a long time scale over the whole region .",
    "@xcite has suggested that there is no physical reason to separate the orion nebula cluster and the trapezium cluster , and the entire region is a single contiguous star forming event .",
    "there are also examples of stellar clusters still producing massive stars .",
    "cep a hw2 is the brightest radio source in cep a @xcite , an active star forming region within the molecular cloud associated with the cluster with an age of 5.5 myr ( cep ob3b ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found a hot core internally heated by a massive protostar , and a circumstellar rotating disk around hw2 .",
    "this suggests that a massive star is still forming in the young cluster .",
    "furthermore , x - ray stars with a mid - infrared ( mir ) spectral energy distribution of young stellar objects ( ysos ) around hw2 have been reported by @xcite .",
    "it is most likely that a low - mass pms population was already formed before the formation of high - mass stars .",
    "once a high - mass star starts to radiate significant amounts of uv radiation , the surrounding material is affected dramatically and the natal molecular cloud is disrupted and the birth of the next generation of stars might be triggered .",
    "the apparent age spread observed in the color - magnitude diagram of young stellar groups has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "they found that the spread could not be explained adequately by the combination of the binarity , photometric uncertainty and variability of the members . in the case of the @xmath6 ori young stellar group , they suggested an age spread of 24 myr .",
    "a possible explanation is that accretion from a disk causes scatter of the stellar continuum light @xcite .",
    "however , another possibility is that stars in a cluster are formed over a period of time .",
    "three - dimensional numerical simulations including protostellar outflow feedback show that the cluster - forming clumps can maintain a quasi - virial equilibrium state for several periods of free - fall time @xcite , suggesting continuous star formation .",
    "@xcite also demonstrated outflow - regulated massive star formation .",
    "the episodic star formation causes an intrinsic spread in age and hence in the position in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we have reported that young stars near the exciting star of the w5e h ii region are systematically older than those near the edge of the h ii region @xcite .",
    "we further suggested that the birth of the most massive star occurs in the late stage of star formation in the cluster .",
    "although the structure of the h ii region is simple to investigate , the distance of w5 is large , at 2.3 kpc , and therefore it is not easily accessible to the wide range of stellar masses .",
    "ic 1396 is a ring - shaped giant h ii region in cep ob2 with a size of about 3@xmath7 , located at the edge of the cepheus bubble , which is a large , far - infrared shell with a diameter of @xmath810@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the structure of ic 1396 is rather simple and is powered by the multiple o star system hd 206267 ( ra = 21@xmath938@xmath1057@xmath1162 , dec = + 57@xmath1229@xmath1320@xmath145 ) , which is located near the geometrical center of ic 1396 in the young cluster trumpler 37 .",
    "the bright members of trumpler 37 have been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are a number of bright - rimmed globules @xcite at its periphery .",
    "its modest distance ( @xmath3 1 kpc ) and low foreground extinction ( @xmath15v @xmath3 1 mag ) make ic 1396 a good subject for our study of low - mass population associated with ob stars .",
    "the mean distance of 76 members of cep ob2 derived from the hipparcos parallax is 615 pc @xcite . @xcite",
    "made a color - magnitude diagram of the intermediate - mass members and fitted them to main - sequence stars at 870 pc .",
    "in this paper , we adopt 870 pc , which is frequently quoted by the recent works ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "h@xmath0 emission , a characteristic of t tauri stars ( tts ) , is radiated from the solar - type magnetic activity in weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) or the chromospheric activity and magnetospheric accretion shock in classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) @xcite .",
    "thus , a survey of h@xmath0 emission - line stars is a powerful method for searching for young low - mass populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , nir observations with array detectors and mir observations from space ( e.g. with the _ spitzer _ space telescope ) have advanced the protostar survey in the dense parts of giant molecular clouds . however ,",
    "the h@xmath0 survey is still useful in areas with moderate or low extinction , and it is also a complementary method to search for pms populations in a wide and rather dispersed region . here , we report an extensive survey of emission - line stars in the ic 1396 h ii region and discuss the formation sequence of low and high mass populations in ic 1396 .",
    "slitless grism spectroscopic searches for h@xmath0 emission objects in ic 1396 were conducted in 2004 and between 2006 and 2009 using the wide field grism spectrograph 2 ( wfgs2 ; * ? ? ?",

    "about 4.2 deg@xmath1 were observed , both in the grism and the direct imaging mode of wfgs2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the boundary of the observed fields and indicates the names of bright - rims , dark clouds , and two o stars in the ic 1396 h ii region . for each field , we have taken a single 30-s exposure in the direct mode with a wide h@xmath0 filter .",
    "then , we inserted a grism and obtained three dithered frames of 300-s exposures for slitless spectroscopy .",
    "direct images with an @xmath2-band filter were also taken with wfgs2 in 2008 august and 2009 august .",
    "three 30-s exposures were made for each field .",
    "the @xmath2-band flux is less affected by excess emission of the circumstellar disk , h@xmath0 emission , and continuum veiling of ctts .",
    "thus , @xmath2-band photometry is useful as a measure of the underlying photosphere of ctts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we could not find any evidence of the difference between the spatial distribution of ctts and wtts .    to identify the haebe stars , which have larger infrared excess than ctts",

    "13 , 236 , and 606 are haebe stars and no .",
    "479 and 545 are class - i objects . in the following discussion",
    ", we have added these stars and 12 t tauri stars with low extinction to the probable members totaling 205 stars .",
    "the number of new unpublished pms candidates identified in the current survey is 72 including three class - i objects or haebe stars .",
    "figure 8 illustrates the contour map of the number density of emission - line stars associated with ic 1396 .",
    "dashed boxes represent the eight subregions , namely , the east , west , sfo38 , sfo37 , sfo39/41 , rim b , halo , and field regions .",
    "their distribution is not very different from figure 2 , though the peak of the distribution at the east region is slightly shifted westward . while the aggregate at the north of b 365 ( see figure 1 ) , which is shown in figure 2b , disappears in figure 8 and",
    "therefore could be a foreground object , other aggregates should be associated with ic 1396 .",
    "table 4 summarizes the number of emission - line stars in each region .",
    "the h@xmath0 stars , whose @xmath15v values we could not obtain , appear to be spread over the observed field rather uniformly .",
    "thus , we suggest a large number of them are field stars .",
    "@xcite determined that the time after the first stars reach the main - sequence is 7 myr in trumpler 37 and @xcite confirmed 4 myr for the age of trumpler 37 from optical photometry and theoretical isochrones .",
    "the expansion of the h ii region creates a swept - up shell and results in a compressed molecular ring around its periphery . from the size of the ring",
    ", @xcite suggested a dynamical age of the system of globules of 23 myr .",
    "figure 9 shows the extinction - corrected @xmath2 vs. ( @xmath2@xmath21 ) diagram of the 194 probable members with @xmath2-band data , using the @xmath2-band extinction correction from @xcite .",
    "here , we adopted the pre - main sequence model of @xcite . their effective temperature and luminosity",
    "are converted into our system using the table of @xcite and the equation of @xcite . in figure 9 , the 0.1 ,",
    "1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , and 100 myr isochrones are overlapped as well as the evolutionary tracks for masses from 0.1 to 2.0 m@xmath39 , at an assumed distance of 870 pc .",
    "as the reddening vector runs almost parallel to the isochrones , the extinction value would not severely affect our age estimate .    the uncertainty of the distance modulus ( 8.949.70 ) and the choice of pms models affects the estimation of ages and masses of h@xmath0 stars from figure 9 .",
    "we used the pre - main sequence models of @xcite , which are converted to our photometric system by a table of @xcite and the equation of @xcite , for comparison . by assuming the nearest distance , 615 pc @xcite , the evolutionary tracks shift upwards , and it makes the age @xmath80.2 dex older in both models .",
    "the age and mass histograms of the probable members in different choices of pms models adopting 870 pc are shown in figure 10 .",
    "they indicate that the numbers of young stars ( @xmath3 1 myr ) predicted from the siess models ( fig 10a ) are generally smaller than those predicted from the palla & stahler models ( fig 10b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of low mass stars ( @xmath3 0.4 m@xmath39 ) derived from the siess models ( fig 10c ) are slightly large compared to those derived from the palla & stahler models ( fig 10d ) .",
    "we should notice the incompleteness of our pms candidate sample along with possible effects on the distribution of masses and ages .",
    "@xcite carefully investigated the stellar population of the orion nebula cluster by using these two pms models .",
    "the completeness function in the mass - age plane , derived from their statistical simulation for two evolutionary models , shows that a large incompleteness correction is needed in the low mass ( @xmath3 0.2 m@xmath39 ) range .",
    "they attributed the difference of results to the different shapes of tracks and isochrones in this mass range .",
    "although we adopted the siess models , the uncertainties would be larger for stars with ages @xmath3 1 myr and masses @xmath3 0.2 m@xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , we could not detect emission - line stars near the region of higher obscuration such as the globules , and within 1@xmath13 of the bright o star hd 206267 , due to saturation of the detectors , light contamination from this star , and diffraction spikes from this star .",
    "table 5 shows the number of h@xmath0 stars in each age and mass bin in figure 9 .",
    "the age and mass histograms of h@xmath0 stars in each subregion are shown in figure 11 .",
    "we combined the sfo37/38/39/41/rim b regions in the brc ( bright - rimmed cloud ) region .",
    "most of the h@xmath0 stars have ages of @xmath3 3 myr and masses of 0.20.6 m@xmath39 .",
    "the number of stars with an age less than 1 myr and with an age of 13 myr are comparable in the region associated with bright rims , i.e. , the brc region .",
    "we confirmed that the above result is also true for the age assigned from the palla and stahler model , and is not dependent on the choice of distance .",
    "the histogram in the west region is similar to that of the brc region , probably because most of the h@xmath0 stars in the west region are associated with rim a.    from the extensive survey of young stars by _ spitzer _ , @xcite found two distinct generations of star formation in w5 .",
    "they considered two triggered star formation mechanisms , radiative driven implosion ( rdi ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and collect - and - collapse , to explain their findings and concluded that both mechanisms are at work in the w5 h ii region .",
    "@xcite extensively studied the nature of infrared bubbles which enclose h ii regions and discussed star formation triggered by the expanding h ii region at their edges .",
    "they show that most of these bubbles enclose h ii regions ionized by o ",
    "b2 stars , many are formed to be surrounded by cold dust shells ( good candidates for c&c processes ) , and many have bright - rimmed dust condensations protruding inside the h ii region ( good candidates for rdi process ) . in the ic 1396 region , the presence of aggregates associated with the bright rims immediately inside the ic 1396 h ii region or the near side of the ionizing star hd 206267 , such as the west ( rim a ) , rim b , and sfo38 regions , suggest that the star formation in these regions has advanced away from hd 206267 in @xmath3 3 myr .",
    "such a configuration is consistent with squeezing of the pre - existing condensations compressed by the pressure of the ionized gas .",
    "the kinematical structure of sfo 37 @xcite and an x - ray study of sfo 38 @xcite also favored the rdi model .      in our previous results for the w5e h ii region @xcite , we have found three aggregates of h@xmath0 emission - line stars in the w5e h ii region .",
    "two of them are located at the edge of the h ii region , and one is near the central exciting o7 star .",
    "the former two aggregates are systematically younger than the latter .    based on a comparison of the stellar ages in the brc region with those in the east region of ic 1396 ( figure 11 )",
    ", it might appear that the low - mass population in the east region is older .",
    "we only find two stars younger than 1 myr in the east region , in contrast to the west region .",
    "it may suggest that the star formation activity in the east region has ceased recently . as there remains no molecular material associated with the population in the east region ,",
    "the exciting star hd 206267 has already dissipated the natal molecular cloud . however",
    ", a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives a probability of @xmath31 15 % that the two samples have the same distribution in age , even if we choose either pms model .",
    "the difference between the ages of h@xmath0 stars in the brcs region and the east region is not statistically significant .",
    "@xcite estimated ages for six members near rim a or in the globule .",
    "they found that the ages of five stars are younger than 1 myr , which is significantly lower than the average age of trumpler 37 .",
    "figure 12 plots the spatial distribution of h@xmath0 stars with derived ages . at a glance ,",
    "younger stars in figure 12a are preferentially located at the west region compared to those at the east region .",
    "again we used k - s test to compare the distribution in right ascension and declination derived from different choice of pms models .",
    "a probability that two samples of different age ( fig 12a and 12b ) have the same distribution in two coordinate axis is @xmath31 25 % and @xmath31 54 % .",
    "thus , the age difference of young stars in the west and the east region is not statistically clear from the spatial distribution of our sample .",
    "in addition to the west region , figure 12b shows a number of stars with an intermediate age ( 13 myr ) in the east and sfo38 regions , extending to the halo region .",
    "a linear sequence of young stars across the center is noticeable .",
    "a filamentary dark cloud extends from rim a to the western rim of the h ii region .",
    "it is noteworthy that h@xmath0 stars are distributed along this structure and further extend to the east of hd 206267 .",
    "this spatial distribution strongly suggests a fossil record of a star forming cloud including rim a and b.    @xcite argued a spatial east  west asymmetry in the young low - mass members of trumpler 37 , compared with more massive ones @xcite . the same spatial asymmetry with respect to the central ionizing o star , hd 206267 ,",
    "was seen in the distribution of the _ spitzer _ irac excess objects @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of h@xmath0 stars with high disk fraction may be explained by photo - evaporation of the disk material around the forming stars by strong uv radiation .",
    "@xcite suggested that the interstellar material , lying between powerful o6 stars and young stars with disks , shields the disk from uv radiation .",
    "however , there is no evidence of such an asymmetry of interstellar material from molecular line @xcite and millimeter dust continuum observations @xcite .",
    "actually , significant destruction of disks occurs for stars located out to distances of @xmath3 0.5 pc , which corresponds to only a few arcmin from hd 206267 , as found in ngc 2244 @xcite .",
    "@xcite additionally suggested probable age differences for the explanation for the asymmetry in the ctts distribution . instead of disk photo - evaporation ,",
    "we prefer that this spatial asymmetry represents the star formation sequence .",
    "if most of the young low - mass population in the west region was formed as a result of a triggered event , those in the east region could be formed along with massive stars .",
    "there are 116 probable members of emission - line star in the brc region including the west region , and the total mass is about 6070 m@xmath4 .",
    "if we add 35 emission - line stars in the east region , the total mass reaches 70 - 90 m@xmath4 . since our survey is biased toward the region of low extinction , the above estimates of the number and mass of the low - mass population in the brc region including the west and the east region should be considered the lower limits . for example",
    ", @xcite found @xmath845 ysos in and around sfo 38 , where we could not detect any h@xmath0 stars in the globule .",
    "of these , 26 sources are class-0/i , class - i , and class - i / ii , but there are no such objects situated outside the ionized rim .",
    "it follows that the birth of low - mass stars associated with bright rims appears to be the primary mode of star formation in ic 1396 at present .",
    "the higher mass o  f stars of trumpler 37 @xcite total @xmath8 200 m@xmath4 in our observed fields ( figure 4 ) . assuming the initial mass function of @xcite between 0.01 m@xmath4 and 50 m@xmath4",
    ", we estimate the total mass of stars in trumpler 37 to be @xmath8 500 m@xmath4 .",
    "young low - mass stars , which probably formed by a triggered mechanism in the brc region , contribute a fraction of the mass of stars in ic 1396 .",
    "@xcite has determined the alignment of ysos and their age gradient at the tip of sfo 37 .",
    "they argued that this alignment and the elongation of the head of the globule are attributed to uv radiation from the o9.5v star , hd206183 , at their formation stage .",
    "the dominant exciting source , however , is currently hd 206267 .",
    "consequently , hd 206267 formed at the late stage of star formation in the central part of the h ii region and disrupted the natal molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite reported the age gradient of the pms candidates along the distance from this hot star .",
    "their results also favors the triggered formation of stars in ic 1396 .",
    "hd 206267 is known as the trapezium system of ob stars with a maximum separation of 15000 au , and the main component a is a triple @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed the observed masses and evolutionary model masses and suggested that the two bright components of the triple are o6.5 v((f ) ) ( a@xmath40 ) with 3861 m@xmath4 and o9.5 : v ( a@xmath41 ) with 1728 m@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the age of hd 206267 is estimated to be @xmath3 3 myr from the main sequence lifetime @xcite .",
    "numerical simulation considering protostellar outflow - driven turbulence has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "following their study , we suggested that the massive exciting star of the w5 e h ii region was possibly formed after the continuous production of stars @xcite .",
    "the birth of the most massive star should be the last stage of star formation .",
    "the contiguous formation of stars for 10 myr in trumpler 37 could be supported by figure 12 .",
    "many of the low - mass stars near rim a and sfo 38 might be formed in @xmath29 3 myr . as there is no conspicuous molecular material except the elephant trunk globule , rim a , in the evacuated dust cavity ( figure 4 ) , hd 206267 was likely born in the central part after the continuous low mass star formation .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the formation of massive stars and the associated low - mass population in trumpler 37 , continued for a few myr .",
    "although it is difficult to separate the low - mass stars formed as the same generation with hd 206267 and formed by the trigger mechanism of hd 206267 , we believe that many of h @xmath0 stars at the rim were triggered to form by a radiation driven implosion mechanism after the formation of hd 206267 .",
    "we have made an extensive survey of emission - line stars in the ic 1396 h ii region to investigate the low - mass pms population near the ob stars .",
    "a total of 639 h@xmath0 stars were detected over a 4-deg@xmath1 area and their @xmath2-photometry was performed .",
    "their spatial distribution shows several aggregates near the bright - rimmed clouds at the center and the edge of the h ii region ( rim a / b and sfo 37 , 38 , 39 , 41 ) and one near the main exciting star of the h ii region .",
    "based on the source extinction estimated from the nir color  color diagram , we have selected pms candidates associated with ic 1396 .",
    "the age and mass were derived from the extinction corrected color - magnitude diagram and theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "most of the h@xmath0 stars have ages of @xmath3 3 myr and masses of 0.20.6 m@xmath4 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the pms candidates indicates that the stellar population in the east region is spatially distinct from that in the west region , associated with rim a globule .",
    "the age difference between two populations was also suggested by @xcite .",
    "the spatio - temporal gradients of the stellar age were also demonstrated near the bright - rimmed clouds by @xcite .",
    "our k - s test does not support the significant difference between ages of two populations .",
    "also , the spatial distribution of @xmath3 1 myr stars is not significantly different from the distribution of 13 myr stars . although the star formation activity in the east region could be low in the last 1 myr , we need further confirmation . the linear sequence of stars including the west ( rim a ) region and rim b region , which is conspicuous in fig 12b of 13 myr age across the center of the h ii region , suggests a fossil record of the star forming cloud .",
    "the formation of massive stars and associated low - mass population of trumpler 37 continuing for a few myr , and the most massive star in trumpler 37 , hd 206267 , was likely born @xmath29 3 myr ago . then , the ic 1396 h ii region was formed by strong uv radiation . in the last stage ,",
    "the h ii region presumably triggered the formation of low - mass stars in the dense inhomogeneity .",
    "our results may suggest that massive stars were born after the continuous formation of low - mass stars for 10 myr .",
    "the birth of the exciting star as the most massive one could be the late stage of slow but contiguous star formation in the natal molecular cloud .",
    "it presumably triggered the formation of many low - mass stars at the dense inhomogeneity in and around the h ii region by a radiation - driven implosion .",
    "spectroscopic followup of our pms candidates to establish their membership correctly and identify their nature is needed to clarify the star formation history of this region .",

    "<S> we have made an extensive survey of emission - line stars in the ic 1396 h ii region to investigate the low - mass population of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 639 h@xmath0 emission - line stars were detected in an area of 4.2 deg@xmath1 and their @xmath2-photometry was measured . </S>",
    "<S> their spatial distribution exhibits several aggregates near the elephant trunk globule ( rim a ) and bright - rimmed clouds at the edge of the h ii region ( rim b and sfo 37 , 38 , 39 , 41 ) , and near hd 206267 , which is the main exciting star of the h ii region . based on the extinction estimated from the near - infrared ( nir ) color  color diagram , </S>",
    "<S> we have selected pre - main sequence star candidates associated with ic 1396 . the age and mass were derived from the extinction corrected color - magnitude diagram and theoretical pre - main sequence tracks . </S>",
    "<S> most of our pms candidates have ages of @xmath3 3 myr and masses of 0.20.6 m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> although it appears that only a few stars were formed in the last 1 myr in the east region of the exciting star , the age difference among subregions in our surveyed area is not clear from the statistical test . </S>",
    "<S> our results may suggest that massive stars were born after the continuous formation of low - mass stars for 10 myr . </S>",
    "<S> the birth of the exciting star could be the late stage of slow but contiguous star formation in the natal molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> it may have triggered to form many low - mass stars at the dense inhomogeneity in and around the h ii region by a radiation - driven implosion . </S>"
