    "has shown , free - energy differences , which refer to equilibrium , can be determined via non - equilibrium processes @xcite .    typically , free - energy differences are beyond the scope of analytic computations and one needs to measure them experimentally or compute them numerically .",
    "highly efficient methods have been developed in order to estimate free - energy differences precisely , including thermodynamic integration @xcite , free - energy perturbation @xcite , umbrella sampling @xcite , adiabatic switching @xcite , dynamic methods @xcite , asymptotics of work distributions @xcite , optimal protocols @xcite , targeted and escorted free - energy perturbation @xcite .    a powerful @xcite and frequently @xcite used method for free - energy determination is two - sided estimation , i.e.  bennett s acceptance ratio method @xcite , which employs a sample of work values of a driven nonequilibrium process together with a sample of work values of the time - reversed process @xcite .",
    "the performance of two - sided free - energy estimation depends on the ratio @xmath0 of the number of forward and reverse work values used .",
    "think of an experimenter who wishes to estimate the free - energy difference with bennett s acceptance ratio method and has the possibility to generate forward as well as reverse work values .",
    "the capabilities of the experiment give rise to an obvious question : if the total amount of draws is intended to be @xmath1 , which is the optimal choice of partitioning @xmath2 into the numbers @xmath3 of forward and @xmath4 of reverse work values , or equivalently , what is the optimal choice @xmath5 of the ratio @xmath6 ?",
    "the problem is to determine the value of @xmath6 that minimizes the ( asymptotic ) mean square error of bennett s estimator when @xmath1 is held constant .    while known since bennett @xcite , the optimal ratio is underutilized in the literature . bennett himself proposed to use a suboptimal equal time strategy , instead , because his estimator for the optimal ratio converges too slowly in order to be practicable .",
    "even questions as fundamental as the existence and uniqueness are unanswered in the literature . moreover , it is not always clear a priori whether two - sided free - energy estimation is better than one - sided exponential work averaging .",
    "for instance , shirts et al .  have presented a physical example where it is optimal to draw work values from only one direction @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in secs .",
    "[ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] we rederive two - sided free - energy estimation and the optimal ratio .",
    "we also remind that two - sided estimation comprises one - sided exponential work averaging as limiting cases for @xmath7 , a result that is also true for the mean square errors of the corresponding estimators .",
    "the central result is stated in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] : the asymptotic mean square error of two - sided estimation is convex in the fraction @xmath8 of forward work values used .",
    "this fundamental characteristic immediately implies that the optimal ratio @xmath9 exists and is unique .",
    "moreover , it explains the generic superiority of two - sided estimation if compared with one - sided , as found in many applications .    to overcome the slow convergence of bennett s estimator of the optimal ratio , which is based on estimating second moments , in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we transform the problem into another form such that the corresponding estimator is entirely based on first moments , which enhances the convergence enormously .    as an application , in sec .",

    "the convexity of the mean square error is a fundamental characteristic of bennett s acceptance ratio method .",
    "this characteristic allows us to state a simple criterion for the existence of a _ local _ minimum of the mean square error in terms of its derivatives at the boundaries .",
    "namely , if @xmath136 is negative and @xmath137 is positive there exists a local minimum of @xmath115 for @xmath121 .",
    "otherwise , no local minimum exists and the global minimum is found on the boundaries of @xmath21 : if @xmath138 , the global minimum is found for @xmath40 , thus it is optimal to measure work values in the reverse direction only and to use the one - sided reverse estimator .",
    "else , if @xmath139 , the global minimum is found for @xmath41 , implying the one - sided forward estimator to be optimal .",
    "in addition , the convexity of the mean square error proves the existence and uniqueness of the optimal ratio , since a convex function has a global minimum on a closed interval .    if a solution of @xmath113 exists , it is unique and @xmath115 attains its global minimum ( @xmath58 $ ] ) there .",
    "in situations of practical interest the optimal ratio is not available _ a priori_. thus , we are going to estimate the optimal ratio .",
    "there exist estimators of the optimal ratio since bennett .",
    "in addition we have just proven that the optimal ratio exists and is unique .",
    "however there is still one obstacle to overcome .",
    "yet , all expressions for estimating the optimal ratio are based on second moments , see e.g.  eq .  .",
    "due to convergence issues , it is not practicable to base any estimator on expressions that involve second moments",
    ". the estimator would converge far too slowly .",
    "for this reason , we transform the problem into a form that employs first moments , only .",

    "we can estimate the overlap measure @xmath140 by using draws from the forward direction , @xmath142 where @xmath143 equals @xmath144 and for @xmath56 the best available estimate of @xmath13 is inserted , i.e.  the two - sided estimate based on the @xmath145 work values .",
    "similarly , we can estimate the overlap measure by using draws from the reverse direction , @xmath146 since in general draws from both directions are available , it is reasonable to take an arithmetic mean of both estimates @xmath147 where the weighting is chosen such that the better estimate , @xmath148 or @xmath149 , contributes stronger : with increasing @xmath150 the estimate @xmath149 becomes more reliable , as @xmath140 is the normalizing constant of the bridging density @xmath151 , eq .  , and @xmath152 ; and conversely for decreasing @xmath150 .",

    "the infimum of @xmath155 finally results in an estimate @xmath156 of the optimal choice @xmath80 of @xmath8 , @xmath157 when searching for the infimum , we also take @xmath158 into account which follow from a series expansion of eq .   in @xmath150 at @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "the costs of measuring a work value in forward direction may differ from the costs of measuring a work value in reverse direction .",
    "the influence of costs on the optimal ratio of sample sizes is investigated here .",
    "different costs can be due to a direction dependent effort of experimental or computational measurement of work ( unfolding a rna may be much easier than folding it ) .",
    "we assume the work values to be uncorrelated , which is essential for the validity of the theory presented in this paper .",
    "thus , a source of nonequal costs , which arises especially when work values are obtained via computer simulations , is the difference in the strength of correlations of consecutive monte - carlo steps in forward and reverse direction . to achieve uncorrelated draws , the `` correlation - lengths '' or `` correlation - times '' have to be determined within the simulation , too .",
    "however , this is advisable in any case of two - sided estimation , independent of the sampling strategy .",
    "let @xmath161 and @xmath162 be the costs of drawing a single forward and reverse work value , respectively .",
    "our goal is to minimize the mean square error @xmath163 while keeping the total costs @xmath164 constant . keeping @xmath165 constant results in @xmath166 which in turn yields @xmath167 if a local minimum exists , it results from @xmath168 which leads to @xmath169 a result bennett was already aware of @xcite .",
    "however , based on second moments , it was not possible to estimate the optimal ratio @xmath9 accurately and reliably .",
    "hence , bennett proposed to use a suboptimal _ equal time strategy _ or _",
    "equal cost strategy _ , which spends an equal amount of expenses to both directions , i.e.   @xmath170 or @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the equal cost choice for @xmath60 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the following result @xmath173\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which states that the asymptotic mean square error of the equal cost strategy is at most sub - optimal by a factor of @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "note however that the equal cost strategy can be far more sub - optimal if the asymptotic limit of large sample sizes is not reached .",
    "since we can base the estimator for the optimal ratio @xmath9 on first moments , see sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we propose a _",
    "dynamic strategy _ that performs better than the equal cost strategy .",
    "the infimum of @xmath175 results in the estimate @xmath156 of the optimal choice @xmath80 of @xmath8 , @xmath176    we remark that opposed to @xmath115 , @xmath177 is not necessarily convex .",
    "however , a global minimum clearly exists and can be estimated .",
    "suppose we want to estimate the free - energy difference with the acceptance ratio method , but have a limit on the total amount of expenses @xmath165 that can be spend for measurements of work . in order to maximize the efficiency ,",
    "the measurements are to be performed such that @xmath8 finally equals the optimal fraction @xmath80 of forward measurements .",
    "the dynamic strategy is as follows :    1 .   in absence of preknowledge on @xmath80 , we start with bennett",
    "s equal cost strategy as an initial guess of @xmath80 .",
    "2 .   after drawing a small number of work values",
    "we make preliminary estimates of the free - energy difference , the mean square error , and the optimal fraction @xmath80 .",
    "3 .   depending on whether the estimated rescaled mean square error @xmath155 is convex , which is a necessary condition for convergence , our algorithm updates the estimate @xmath156 of @xmath80 .",
    "further work values are drawn such that @xmath8 dynamically follows @xmath156 , while @xmath156 is updated repeatedly .",
    "there is no need to update @xmath156 after each individual draw . splitting the total costs into a sequence @xmath178 , not necessarily equidistant",
    ", we can predefine when and how often an update in @xmath156 is made .",
    "namely , this is done whenever the actually spent costs reach the next value @xmath179 of the sequence .",
    "the dynamic strategy can be cast into an algorithm .",

    "think of a long time experiment which is subject to currency changes , inflation , terms of trade , innovations , and so on . of advantage",

    "the inset shows that the mean square error of the dynamic strategy approaches the asymptotic optimum , whereas the equal cost strategy is suboptimal .",
    "note that for small sample sizes the asymptotic behavior does not represent the actual mean square error . ]    in combination with a good a priori choice of the initial value of @xmath21 , the use of the dynamic strategy enables a superior convergence and precision of free - energy estimation , see figs .",
    "[ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] . due to insight into some particular system under consideration ,",
    "it is not unusual that one has a priori knowledge which results in a better guess for the initial choice of @xmath21 in the dynamic strategy than starting with @xmath272 .",
    "for instance , a good initial choice is known when estimating the chemical potential via widom s particle insertion and deletion @xcite .",
    "namely , it is a priori clear that inserting particles yields much more information then deleting particles , since the phase - space which is accessible to particles in the  deletion - system \" is effectively contained in the phase - space accessible to the particles in the  insertion - system \" , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a good a priori initial choice for @xmath21 may be @xmath273 with which the dynamic strategy outperforms any other strategy that the authors are aware of .",
    "once reaching the limit of large sample sizes , the dynamic strategy is insensitive to the initial choice of @xmath21 , since the strategy is robust and finds the optimal fraction @xmath80 of forward measurements itself .",
    "two - sided free - energy estimation , i.e.  the acceptance ratio method @xcite , employs samples of @xmath3 forward and @xmath4 reverse work measurements in the determination of free - energy differences in a statistically optimal manner . however , its statistical properties depend strongly on the ratio @xmath274 of work values used . as a central result",
    "we have proven the convexity of the asymptotic mean square error of two - sided free - energy estimation as a function of the fraction @xmath60 of forward work values used . from here",
    "follows immediately the existence and uniqueness of the optimal fraction @xmath80 which minimizes the asymptotic mean square error .",
    "this is of particular interest if we can control the value of @xmath21 , i.e.  can make additional measurements of work in either direction . drawing such that we finally reach @xmath275",
    ", the efficiency of two - sided estimation can be enhanced considerably .",
    "consequently , we have developed a dynamic sampling strategy which iteratively estimates @xmath80 and makes additional draws or measurements of work .",
    "thereby , the convexity of the mean square error enters as a key criterion for the reliability of the estimates . for a simple example which allows to compare with analytic calculations",
    ", the dynamic strategy has shown to work perfectly .    in the asymptotic limit of large sample sizes",
    "the dynamic strategy is optimal and outperforms any other strategy .",
    "nevertheless , in this limit it has to compete with the near optimal equal cost strategy of bennett which also performs very good .",
    "it is worth mentioning that even if the latter comes close to the performance of ours , it is worthwhile the effort of using the dynamic strategy , since the underlying algorithm can be easily implemented and does cost quite anything if compared to the effort required for drawing additional work values .",
    "most important for experimental and numerical estimation of free - energy differences is the range of small and moderate sample sizes . for this relevant range , it is found that the dynamic strategy performs very good , too .",
    "it converges significantly better than the equal cost strategy .",
    "in particular , for small and moderate sample sizes it can improve the accuracy of free - energy estimates by half an order of magnitude .",
    "we close our considerations by mentioning that the two - sided estimator is typically far superior with respect to one - sided estimators : assume the support and @xmath32 and @xmath33 is symmetric about @xmath13 ; ] then , if the densities are symmetric to each other , @xmath276 , the optimal fraction of forward draws is @xmath277 by symmetry .",
    "therefore , if the symmetry is violated not too strongly , the optimum will remain near @xmath268 .",
    "continuous deformations of the densities change the optimal fraction @xmath80 continuously .",
    "thus , @xmath80 does not reach @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , for some certain strength of asymmetry .",
    "it is exceptionally hard to violate the symmetry such that @xmath80 hits the boundary @xmath72 or @xmath73 . in consequence , in almost all situations , the two - sided estimator is superior .",
