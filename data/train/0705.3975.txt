    "over the past few decades , a considerable number of studies have been conducted to identify the origin of neutron - capture elements .",
    "measurements of heavy elements for very metal - poor stars provide a unique opportunity to determine the abundance patterns produced by individual nucleosynthesis processes in the early galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are key to understanding the astrophysical sites of the processes .",
    "in particular , detailed abundance studies for selected neutron - capture enhanced , metal - poor stars have revealed that heavy neutron - capture elements ( @xmath0 ) show an abundance pattern that is identical , within the measurement errors , to that of the r - process component of solar - system material ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    however , these objects show some deficiencies in light neutron - capture elements ( @xmath1 ) compared to the scaled solar r - process curve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the r - process abundance pattern in solar - system material is not fully explained by the component that makes the pattern found in such r - process - enhanced stars ( sometimes referred to as `` main '' r - process ) , but another component that yields light neutron - capture elements with small production of heavy ones is required .",
    "indeed , a some fraction of very metal - poor stars have high abundance ratios of light neutron - capture elements sr , y , and zr , while their heavy ones ( e.g. , ba , eu ) are very deficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such objects possibly record the abundance patterns produced by the second component .",
    "the component that is responsible for light neutron - capture elements of the r - process fraction of solar - system material is not well understood , and no established name is given .",
    "we here refer to this process as `` weak '' r - process @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the r - process component in the solar system is derived by subtracting the s - process component from the solar abundances , based on the s - process models @xcite .",
    "therefore , the weak r - process referred in this paper possibly corresponds to some processes other than r - process .",
    "the bright metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 ) star hd  122563 is one of the stars having excesses of light neutron - capture elements .",
    "our previous work obtained high resolution spectroscopy for this object and determined the abundances of 19 neutron - capture elements from sr to yb ( @xmath3 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the abundances of neutron - capture elements in this star continuously decrease with the increase of atomic number .",
    "that is , the elements with intermediate mass ( @xmath4 ) have moderate enhancements with respect to heavy ones ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is the first determination of the overall abundance pattern that could represent the yields of the weak r - process mentioned above .    in this paper",
    ", we report the abundance pattern of neutron - capture elements in the extremely metal - poor red giant hd  88609 .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that this object has large excesses of light neutron - capture elements and underabundances of heavy ones similar to hd  122563 .",
    "the metallicity of hd  88609 ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 ) is even lower than that of hd  122563 ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) .",
    "hence , hd  88609 could be an ideal object in order to study the nature of the weak r - process .",
    "however , abundance measurements of the neutron - capture elements for this object are quite limited because of the deficiency of heavy neutron - capture elements .",
    "we determined the detailed abundance pattern of heavy elements for this object based on a high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio spectrum .",
    "the observation and abundance measurements are reported in   2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the results are compared with previous work in   4 . in   5 ,",
    "the results are compared with the abundance pattern of the solar - system r - process component , and with that of hd  122563 .",
    "implications of our new measurement for hd  88609 are also discussed .",
    "high dispersion spectroscopy of hd  88609 was carried out with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph ( hds : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on 30 april , 2004 and 19 - 20 october 2005 .",
    "our spectrum covers the wavelength range from 3020 to 4780  with a resolving power of @xmath7 = 90,000 , as in the study for hd  122563 ( paper i ) .",
    "the total exposure time of the two observing runs is 12600 seconds . in addition , the spectrum around 5000  obtained by @xcite was used to determine the abundances of cu , zn , y , and ba abundances ( see table 1 for the details of the observations ) .",
    "the data reduction was carried out in a standard manner using the iraf echelle package as described in paper i and @xcite . the signal",
    "to noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectrum ( per 0.9 km s@xmath8 pixel ) estimated from the photon counts is 50 at 3100  ; 200 at 3500  ; 370 at 3900  ; 510 at 4200  and 650 at 4500 ",
    ". these s / n ratios are not as high as those of the spectrum of hd  122563 ( paper i ) , but sufficient for our purposes .",
    "for our quantitative abundance measurements , we used the analysis program sptool developed by y. takeda ( private communication ) , based on kurucz s atlas9/width9 @xcite .",
    "sptool calculates synthetic spectra and equivalent widths of lines on the basis of the given model atmosphere , line data , and chemical composition , under the assumption of lte .",
    "we adopted the model atmosphere parameters ( effective temperature : @xmath9 , gravity : @xmath10 , micro - turbulent velocity : @xmath11 , and metallicity : [ fe / h ] ) derived by @xcite : @xmath9 = 4550 k , @xmath12 = 1.1 , @xmath11 = 2.4 km s@xmath8 , and [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .",
    "we adopted the line list used in the previous study for hd  122563 ( paper i ) , which is given in table [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "all the lines used in the previous study were also detected in the spectrum of hd  88609 .",
    "an advantage in the present analysis is that , since the metallicity of this object is lower than that of hd  122563 , the effect of the blends of lines decreases .",
    "equivalent widths of isolated lines are measured by fitting a gaussian profile .",
    "the lines of 5105 , 4810 , 4883 , 5087 , and 4934 are analyzed using the spectrum of @xcite , which has sufficient s / n in this wavelength region ( 150 at 5000  ) .",
    "the values of the equivalent widths of 5853 and 6141  are adopted from @xcite .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : table3 ] .",
    "a spectrum synthesis technique is applied to lines which are severely affected by blending and/or hyperfine splitting .",
    "equivalent widths of such lines given in table [ tab : table2 ] are calculated by spectrum synthesis for the derived abundances .",
    "we used the solar system abundances obtained by @xcite to derive [ x / fe ] values .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] depicts representative examples of the quality of the observed spectra , and the fits to synthetic spectra .",
    "the abundances of hd  122563 are also given in this table for comparison purposes .",
    "we note that the list of abundances in table 2 of paper i contains small mistakes , which are corrected in table 3 of the present paper .",
    "the difference is at most 0.08 dex ( ce ) , and does not have significant influence on the conclusions of the previous paper .",
    "the size of the random errors is estimated from the standard deviation ( 1@xmath14 ) of the abundances derived from individual lines for elements that have four or more lines available for the abundance analysis .",
    "for the abundances of elements based on less than four lines , we employ the mean of the random errors estimated from those elements with four or more lines available ( 0.12 dex ) .",
    "for most of these elements , the abundances derived from individual lines distribute within 0.12 dex around the mean abundance that is adopted as the final result .",
    "exceptions are cu , dy , and er , for which we adopt 0.20 dex as the random errors .",
    "we also estimate the random errors in the abundance measurement from the uncertainties of equivalent width measurements , which are estimated using the relation @xmath15)$ ] @xcite .",
    "the errors of abundances from equivalent width measurement are smaller than 0.12 dex for most lines .",
    "the estimated errors for 5105 and @xmath163549 are very large , because of the weakness of these lines .",
    "however , the abundance results do not significantly change if these lines are excluded in the analysis .",
    "we note that , since contaminations to the @xmath173819 , @xmath174205 , and @xmath173481 are possibly significant , these lines are not used to derive final results .",
    "although the s / n ratio of the hd  122563 spectrum is better than the hd  88609 one , the standard deviation of the abundances derived from four or more lines for hd  88609 ( 0.12 dex ) is slightly smaller than those for hd  122563 ( 0.14 dex ) .",
    "this suggests that factors other than the quality of the spectrum also affect the random errors .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of hd  88609 are quite similar to those of hd  122563 , and the same line set is used for the abundance analysis .",
    "therefore , we adopt the errors due to the uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath18 = 100 k , @xmath19 = 0.3 dex , @xmath20 = 0.5 km s@xmath8 , and @xmath21[fe / h ] = 0.20 dex ) estimated for hd  122563 ( table 3 of paper i ) . the total systematic errors which are shown in table 3 ( @xmath14 ) are derived by the root sum square ( r.s.s . ) of the uncertainties contributed by the four parameters .",
    "such systematic errors do not significantly affect the abundance ratios of neutron - capture elements , in particular those derived from species with the same ionization stage .",
    "the effects of uncertainties of atmospheric parameters on abundance ratios ( and the abundance pattern ) of neutron - capture elements are estimated by the following procedure ; 1 ) we calculate the average of the abundance changes due to the change of each atmospheric parameters ( e.g. , @xmath18 ) for neutron capture elements ( 19 species ) ; 2 ) we calculate the deviation of the abundance changes for individual species from the above average value ; 3 ) we adopt the r.s.s . of the above deviations for the four parameters as the systematic errors for the discussion on the abundance ratios ( @xmath22 in table 3 ) .",
    "the typical value is 0.07 dex for the ionized species , while that is 0.12 dex for the neutral ones .",
    "the radial velocity is measured using 14 clean iron lines .",
    "the derived radial velocity is 37.69 @xmath23 0.3  km s@xmath8 from the data of oct .",
    "this value agrees well with the value 37.28 @xmath23 0.43  km s@xmath8 derived by our previous study @xcite .",
    "there is , so far , no evidence that this object belongs to a binary system .",
    "in spite of the brightness of hd  88609 , abundance measurements of neutron - capture elements have been reported only for several species in previous work , because of the deficiency of heavy neutron - capture elements .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows comparisons of the abundances of neutron - capture elements derived by the present analysis with recent studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "since the present work adopts the atmospheric parameters determined by @xcite for the abundance analysis , no systematic error is expected . although sr , y , zr , and ba are detected by @xcite ,",
    "many lines are added to previous data by this analysis .",
    "the abundances of these elements determined by the two studies agree within the errors .",
    "we note that the ba abundance derived by the present work is higher than the value of @xcite , but this is because the present analysis includes the two lines in the red region that give systematically higher abundances than those from the two resonance lines .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analyzed the neutron - capture elements in this object .",
    "a comparison of equivalent widths of 25 lines of zn , y , zr , and ba ( figure [ fig : fig2a ] ) shows a systematic difference by 11% between the two studies .",
    "this results in the abundance difference of at most 0.1 dex . indeed , the abundances of y , zr , and ba derived by our analysis technique using the equivalent width of @xcite and @xcite , differ only 0.03  0.08 dex from their results .",
    "the abundances determined by the present study agree well with their results . however , the atmospheric parameters adopted in their analysis differ from ours : the effective temperature adopted in our analysis is 150k higher than that of @xcite , while our gravity ( @xmath12 ) is 0.7 dex higher than their value . the differences of these parameters could result in systematic abundance differences of about 0.3 dex , which are not found between the two studies .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the spectrum of hd  88609 partially using the equivalent widths of @xcite . since they derived the atmospheric parameters by a similar method to @xcite ,",
    "the values are in good agreement with ours . however",
    ", systematic difference in the derived abundances is found between the two works ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the comparisons of our results with those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that systematic differences exist in abundances of neutron - capture elements , taking account of adopted atmospheric parameters .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is the difference of abundance analysis tools .",
    "we note that , although we can not identify the reason for this systematic difference , the abundance ratios ( patterns ) of neutron - capture elements show relatively good agreement between these works .",
    "our abundance analyses for hd  88609 based on high resolution spectroscopy determined the abundances of 19 neutron - capture elements as for hd  122563 by our previous work .",
    "the discussion in this section focuses on the comparison of the abundance patterns of these elements between the two objects , and implications of the new results obtained for hd  88609 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the abundance pattern of hd  88609 , compared with that of the solar - system r - process component .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the abundances of light neutron - capture elements ( 38 @xmath24 z @xmath24 47 ) are much higher than those of heavy ones in hd  88609 , compared to the solar - system r - process pattern .",
    "this indicates that the neutron - capture elements of hd  88609 , as we found for hd  122563 , are not a result of the main r - process , but were produced by another process .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the abundance differences from the solar system r - process component in the logarithmic scale for hd  88609 ( this work ) , hd  122563 ( paper i ) , and cs  22892 - 052 @xcite .",
    "a clear result is that the abundance pattern of hd  88609 is very similar to that of hd  122563 .",
    "this result was partially expected from the sample selection : we selected objects having high abundance ratios between light and heavy neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , sr / ba ) .",
    "however , an important finding is that the two objects have quite similar abundance patterns of elements between the first and second abundance peaks ( @xmath4 ) , which are determined for hd  88609 , for the first time , by the present work .",
    "we discussed possible nucleosynthesis processes that explain the abundance pattern of hd  122563 in paper i. the main r - process and the main s - process are excluded , because they produce much higher abundance ratios of heavy to light neutron - capture elements than found in hd  122563 .",
    "the weak s - process is unlikely to be the source of neutron - capture elements of hd  122563 , because of the moderate excesses of elements with intermediate mass ( e.g. , pd ) .",
    "we concluded that an unknown component of the r - process is responsible for the light neutron - capture elements in hd  122563 .",
    "we referred to the `` lighter element primary process ( lepp ) '' proposed by @xcite and the `` weak '' ( or `` failed '' ) r - process @xcite as the possible sources of neutron - capture elements in paper i. our present study reveals that hd  88609 is the second example of metal - poor stars that have the abundance pattern representing such a process , and hd  122563 is not a peculiar object .    here",
    "we inspect the difference of the abundance patterns between the two objects in some detail .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows the abundance differences of neutron - capture elements on a logarithmic scale between hd  88609 and hd  122563 as a function of atomic number .",
    "the least square fit to the data points suggests that the decreasing trend is steeper in hd  88609 than that in hd  122563 . the regression analysis and the spearman rank correlation test indicate that the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the abundance difference and the atomic number is rejected at the 95% confidence level .",
    "hence , though the result is not definitive , a correlation between the two values likely exists .",
    "our conclusion here is that the abundance patterns of neutron - capture elements in hd  88609 and hd  122563 are quite similar , though a small difference is suggested .",
    "one might recall the proposed uniqueness of the abundance pattern produced by the main r - process , which is confirmed by the observations of several r - process enhanced , extremely metal - poor stars ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical studies based on the neutrino wind scenario also predict the robustness of abundance patterns when the requisite physical conditions ( e.g. , high entropy , short dynamic timescale , or low electron fraction ) for the production of the main r - process nuclei are obtained @xcite .",
    "however , the similarity of the abundance patterns found in the two objects can not be interpreted as uniqueness of the pattern produced by the weak r - process ( or lepp ) , because the two objects were selected to have similarly high sr / ba abundance ratios .",
    "model calculations for insufficient conditions for the main r - process show that the r - processing appears to be highly sensitive to the model parameters ( e.g. , electron fraction ) , resulting in various abundance curves ( s. wanajo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "it may be possible , therefore , that we have just found two similar ones out of various abundance curves from the very weak r - process ( producing only sr , y , and zr ) to the main r - process ( producing ba , eu , and heavier )",
    ". further observations of objects having different sr / ba ratios will uncover the diversity of abundance patterns . in case that the similarity of the weak r - process patterns is confirmed for a larger sample of stars",
    ", it will provide unique constraints on the theoretical r - process modeling .",
    "we also discussed the origin of heavy neutron - capture elements ( @xmath25 ) in hd  122563 , whose abundances significantly deviate from the solar - system r - process abundance pattern , in paper i. we argued the possibility of some contamination of the s - process that can partially explain the excesses of ba , la , and ce with respective to eu , though an s - process contribution is unlikely significant at the metallicity of that object , i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath2 .",
    "the metallicity of hd  88609 ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) is even lower than that of hd  122563 .",
    "no previous studies suggest contributions of the s - process to objects with such low metallicity .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the deviation of the abundances of heavy neutron - capture elements in hd  88609 , and probably in hd  122563 , from the main r - process pattern is not a result of contamination of the s - process yields , but implies that the weak r - process produces a different abundance pattern of heavy neutron - capture elements from that produced by the main r - process .",
    "this result gives another constraint on the models of the process that yielded light neutron - capture elements in the very early galaxy .",
