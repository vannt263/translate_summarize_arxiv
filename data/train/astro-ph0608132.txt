    "the temporal decay index @xmath2 , together with the spectral index , provides us precious information about grb jets and their environment . in the pre - swift era",

    "the multi - wavelength observatory swift was launched in nov 2004 .",
    "thanks to its fast pointing capabilities swift is disclosing the early afterglow phase .",
    "one of unexpected finds by swift is that early x - ray afterglows show a canonical behavior , where light curves include three components : ( 1 ) a steep decay component , ( 2 ) a shallow decay component and ( 3 ) a `` normal '' decay component . on top of this canonical behavior , many events have superimposed x - ray flares ( zhang et al . 2006a ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; chincarini et al 2005 ; obrien et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the transition from the early steep decay to the shallow decay typically occurs at several hundred seconds , and the timescale is comparable to the duration of rather long grbs .",
    "when discussing the early afterglow and its connection to the prompt emission component , the decay index is very sensitive to the reference time @xmath0 one chooses . correctly choosing @xmath0 is therefore essential to derive the right index as well as to interpret each component in the canonical light curve ( piro et al .",

    "they sought for a possible delay of the afterglow onset by fitting the early x - ray light curves ( the components 1 and 2 which we have discussed above ) with a single power - law model . in both cases ,",
    "the decaying light curves can be fitted if the onset of the afterglow is shifted to @xmath3 s after the burst trigger with a single power - law . however , while in the case of grb 050126 the light curve does not allow us to clearly state whether a broken power - law modeling is better than a single power - law model , for grb 050219a a broken power - law definitively provides a better fit .    in the standard grb model",

    "their numerical light curves show that measuring times from the beginning of the prompt phase is a good approximation .",

    "although the origin of observed time is arbitrary , a natural definition of observed time is given by the delay of photons emitted from a shock front at a lab time @xmath9 with respect to the photons emitted from the `` explosion '' at @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "the observed time is given by @xmath13 the shock radius is almost proportional to the lab time , @xmath14 . considering that internal shocks occur and produce gamma - rays at radii much smaller than the deceleration radius of the fireball , the prompt gamma - rays associated with the outermost element of the fireball should propagate practically on the dashed line in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the grb trigger almost coincides with the explosion @xmath15 .",
    "the difference is small , and order of the variability timescale of the prompt emission , because the variability timescale directly reflects the inhomogeneity scale in a fireball ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig1 ] will be called the gamma - ray front in the following sections .    a fireball with an initial lorentz factor @xmath16 decelerates when it collects a large volume of ambient material with a mass density @xmath17 .",
    "equalizing energy of the shocked ambient material @xmath18 and fireball energy @xmath19 , we obtain the deceleration radius @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sedov length .",

    "a relativistic reverse shock reduces considerably the lorentz factor of the fireball material which it crosses . in such a case ,",

    "however , the bm blast wave scaling is applicable only after the fireball is decelerated ( e.g. kobayashi , piran & sari 1999 ) . at earlier times the fireball ( the thick solid line )",

    "corresponding to the major energy release from the central engine at the last moment , the inner edge of the shell with a width @xmath162 sec is assumed to have an energy @xmath163 larger than the energy @xmath164 ergs in the preceding outer part with a width @xmath165 sec .",
    "the lorentz factors of the two components at the end of the internal shock phase are the same value of @xmath122 .",
    "both components should be in the thick shell regime , otherwise the deceleration time of the shell becomes larger than the flare occurrence time @xmath149 sec .",
    "the deceleration radius of the shell should be larger than the radius @xmath166 at which a reverse shock crosses the outer component where @xmath167 . the separation at the deceleration time between the gamma - ray front and the reference bm blast wave satisfies @xmath168 .",
    "the separation at that time between the gamma - ray front and the fireball is @xmath169 where we have assumed the fireball evolution @xmath170 before the deceleration .",
    "note that a broke power law description of @xmath122 around the deceleration radius is a good approximation in the thick shell case .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath171 .",
    "the precursor discussion at the beginning of this section corresponds to the two component model with @xmath172 .",
    "we can show that the separation ratio at the deceleration time is @xmath173 in this case .",
    "since replotting figure [ thicklc ] we have found that @xmath174 to produce an early steep decay , in the scenario ( 2 ) @xmath163 should be at least ten times larger than @xmath175 .",
    "this requires a large energy budget for the central engine @xmath176 ergs . even in the limit of @xmath177 ,",
    "the small ratio @xmath178 does not lead to a very steep decay of @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that even an inhomogeneous fireball can not produce x - ray flares in early afterglow via external shock emission process .",
    "we have studied the reference time @xmath0 for the afterglow modeling . although measuring times from the beginning of the prompt emission ( grb trigger ) might cause a slight overestimate of the early afterglow slope in the thick shell case .",
    "this choice of @xmath0 gives a reasonable approximation , and it does not induce a very steep decay ( @xmath180 ) like the early steep decay or x - ray flares in the canonical swift x - ray light curve .    the leading model to explain the rapid decay and flares in early x - ray afterglow is the internal shock emission .",
    "a clear , testable prediction of this model is that the temporal decay index @xmath2 of the tail part should be related to the spectral index @xmath181 by an equation @xmath182 ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "when evaluating the emission decay @xmath183 in the internal shock model , an important difference is that the grb trigger time is no longer special .",
    "the reference time @xmath0 should correspond to the onset of each particular spike in the prompt emission or in afterglow ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ; zhang et al . 2006a",
    "; nousek et al . 2006 ; fan & wei 2005 ) .",
    "every time when the central engine is re - stared to eject sub - shells , the reference time @xmath0 should be re - set to the reactivation time of the engine .",
    "although obrien et al . ( 2006 ) have found that @xmath2 appears to be largely independent of @xmath181 when the bat trigger time is used as @xmath0 , liang et al ( 2006 ) have shown that the relation @xmath182 is more or less satisfied in most cases if @xmath0 is set near the beginning of rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission or a corresponding x - ray flare , and if the underlying forward shock emission component is subtracted .",
    "swift observations support the internal shock model",
    ".    the self - consistent internal shock interpretation should be more favorable than the beginning - of - the - afterglow interpretation .",
    "the latter can not explain multiple x - ray flares in a single event .",
    "such behavior is observed in many swift bursts ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; falcone et al .",
    "2006 ; romano et al . 2006 ; obrien et al 2006 ) .",
    "usually x - ray flux already begins to decay before x - ray flares appear , and it suggests that the onset of afterglow is prior to the flares . if a large amount of energy is impulsively injected to a fireball during the deceleration , @xmath0 might be re - set to the injection time .",
    "however , an afterglow baseline also should shift after a flare ( energy injection ) .",
    "this clearly contradicts with observations in which after a flare peak , afteglow decays back to its pre - flare flux level .",
    "we can not explain x - ray flares by the shift of @xmath0 associated with large energy injections .",
    "swift discovered that a large fraction of x - ray afterglows have a slow decay phase , and it is suggested that energy injection into a blast wave takes place several hundred seconds after the burst .",
    "this implies that right after the burst the kinetic energy of a blast wave is very low and in turn the efficiency of internal shock process is extremely high ( zhang et al .",
    "2006a ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; ioka et al . 2005 ; granot , knigl & piran 2006 ; zhang et al.2006b ; however see also fan & piran 2006 ) .",
    "the round - off forward shock peak in the thin shell case might be a good candidate for the shallow decay phase .",
    "however , if we interpret the observed shallow decay as the round - shape of the deceleration phase , the model light curve is shallower than some of the observed ones .",
    "it may be because the observed curve is the combination of this round phase and the rapid decay from the grb tail emission ( high latitude ) . equalizing the deceleration time and the shallow phase timescale we obtain the initial lorentz factor @xmath184 where the time dilation effect is taken into account @xmath185 .    for a wind environment",
    ", we can discuss the @xmath0 issue in a very similar way .",
    "the lorentz factor of a shocked shell is constant in both of the thin and thick shell cases during the shock crossing , while the bm blast wave decelerates as @xmath125 ( kobayashi & zhang 2003 ) .",
    "the separations are comparable @xmath186 at the deceleration time .",
    "measuring times from the beginning of the prompt phase should be a good approximation for events in a wind environment also . since most bursts in a wind environment fall in the thick shell case ( kobayashi , & zhang 2004 ) , and since the deceleration time is comparable to grb duration in the thick shell case , another process ( e.g. refreshed shocks ) rather than the afterglow peak is necessary to explain the shallow decay phase .",
