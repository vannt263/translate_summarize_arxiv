    "with the increasing accuracy of the lep measurements , it has become more important than ever performing the precision test of the standard model ( sm ) and its extensions .",
    "a standard model fit to the latest lep data yields the top mass , @xmath22 @xmath6 @xcite . with this large top quark mass ,",
    "the @xmath0 vertex contribution , which is proportional to @xmath23 , becomes more significant , and can provide a powerful tool to constrain @xmath24 experimetally .",
    "this is still very useful because the measured top mass from cdf @xcite , @xmath5 @xmath6 , has a large error bars and d0 gives just the lower bound on @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath6 @xcite . with the improved measurement for the @xmath26 partial width to @xmath27 , primarily due to the use of new life time - based techniques ,",
    "one may be able to put more precise bound on @xmath24 .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath28 has increased over the year , resulting in larger experimental value for @xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) , and therefore rather small upper bound on @xmath24 is favored in the sm @xcite .",
    "one could certainly interpret this as a possible manifestation of new physics beyond the sm , where at one loop the negative standard top quark contributions are cancelled to a certain extent by the contributions from the new particles , thereby allowing considerably larger @xmath24 than in the sm .",
    "in fact , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) realizes this possibility .",
    "another very interesting observable which encodes the one loop corrections to the @xmath0 vertex is @xmath11 first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in supergravity(sugra ) models , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite can be described by at most 5 parameters : the top - quark mass ( @xmath24 ) , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values ( @xmath8 ) , and three universal soft - supersymmetry - breaking parameters ( @xmath30 ) .    in this work",
    "we explore the minimal @xmath3 sugra @xcite and the no - scale @xmath4 sugra @xcite in terms of @xmath11 parameter which encodes the one - loop corrections to the @xmath0 vertex .",
    "moreover , we attempt to see how well these models can fit in rather uncomfortably high 1993 lep value for @xmath2 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the minimal @xmath3 and @xmath4 sugra models both contain , at low energy , the sm gauge symmetry and the particle content of the mssm . a few crucial differences between the two models",
    "are : + ( i ) the unification groups are different , @xmath3 versus @xmath4 .",
    "+ ( ii ) the gauge coupling unification occurs at @xmath32 @xmath6 in the minimal @xmath3 model whereas in @xmath33 model it occurs at the string scale @xmath34 @xmath6 @xcite . in @xmath4 sugra ,",
    "the gauge unification is delayed because of the effects of an additional pair of , vector - like representations with intermediate - scale masses .",
    "the different heavy field content at the unification scale leads to different constraints from proton decay .",
    "+ ( iii ) in the minimal @xmath3 sugra , proton decay is highly constraining whereas it is not in @xmath33 sugra .",
    "the procedure to restrict 5-dimensional parameter spaces is as follows @xcite .",
    "first , upon sampling a specific choice of ( @xmath30 ) at the unification scale and ( @xmath35 ) at the electroweak scale , the renormalization group equations ( rge ) are run from the unification scale to the electroweak scale , where the radiative electroweak breaking condition is imposed by minimizing the effective 1-loop higgs potential , which determines the higgs mixing term @xmath18 up to its sign .",
    "we also impose consistency constraints such as perturbative unification and the naturalness bound of @xmath36 .",
    "finally , all the known experimental bounds on the sparticle masses are imposed . ,",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "] this prodedure yields the restricted parameter spaces for the two models .",
    "further reduction in the number of input parameters in @xmath4 sugra is made possible because in specific string - inpired scenarions for ( @xmath30 ) at the unification scale these three parameters are computed in terms of just one of them @xcite .",
    "one obtains @xmath41 in the _ no - scale _ scenario and @xmath42 , @xmath43 in the _ dilaton _ scenario .",
    "the low energy predictions for the sparticle mass spectra are quite different in the two sugra models mainly due to the different pattern of supersymmetry radiative breaking . in the minimal @xmath3 sugra ,",
    "all the squarks except the lighter stop and all the higgs except the lighter neutral higgs are quite heavy ( @xmath44 a few hundred gev ) whereas they can be quite light in the @xmath4 sugra .",
    "this difference leads to strikingly different phenomenology in the two models , for example in the flavor changing radiative decay @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "there are several schemes to parametrize the electroweak vacuum polarization corrections @xcite .",
    "it can be shown , by expanding the vacuum polarization tensors to order @xmath47 , that one obtains three independent physical parameters .",
    "alternatively , one can show that upon symmetry breaking three additional terms appear in the effective lagrangian @xcite . in the @xmath48 scheme @xcite , the deviations of the model predictions from the sm predictions ( with fixed sm values for @xmath49 )",
    "are considered as the effects from  new physics \" .",
    "this scheme is only valid to the lowest order in @xmath47 , and is therefore not applicable to a theory with light new particles comparable to @xmath50 . in the @xmath46-scheme @xcite , on the other hand ,",
    "the model predictions are absolute and also valid up to higher orders in @xmath47 , and therefore this scheme is more applicable to the electroweak precision tests of the mssm @xcite and a class of supergravity models @xcite .    there are two different @xmath46-schemes . the original scheme @xcite was considered in one of author s previous analyses @xcite , where @xmath51 are defined from a basic set of observables @xmath52 and @xmath53 . due to the large @xmath24-dependent vertex corrections to @xmath54",
    ", the @xmath51 parameters and @xmath54 can be correlated only for a fixed value of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath54 were not included in ref .",
    "however , in the new @xmath46-scheme , introduced recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the above difficulties are overcome by introducing a new parameter @xmath1 to encode the @xmath0 vertex corrections .",
    "the four @xmath46 s are now defined from an enlarged set of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath53 without even specifying @xmath24 .",
    "this new scheme was adopted in a previous analysis by one of us ( g.p . ) in the context of the @xmath4 sugra models @xcite . in this work",
    "we use this new @xmath46-scheme .",
    "as is well known , the sm contribution to @xmath60 depends quadratically on @xmath24 but only logarithmically on the sm higgs boson mass ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "therefore upper bounds on @xmath24 have a non - negligible @xmath61 dependence : up to @xmath62 @xmath6 stronger when going from a heavy ( @xmath63 ) to a light ( @xmath64 @xmath6 ) higgs boson .",
    "it is also known in the mssm that the largest supersymmetric contributions to @xmath60 are expected to arise from the @xmath65-@xmath66 sector , and in the limiting case of a very light stop , the contribution is comparable to that of the @xmath67-@xmath68 sector .",
    "the remaining squark , slepton , chargino , neutralino , and higgs sectors all typically contribute considerably less . for increasing sparticle masses , the heavy sector of the theory decouples , and only sm effects with a _",
    "higgs boson survive .",
    "however , for a light chargino ( @xmath69 ) , a @xmath26-wavefunction renormalization threshold effect coming from z - vacuum polarization diagram with the lighter chargino in the loop can introduce a substantial @xmath47-dependence in the calculation @xcite .",
    "this results in a weaker upper bound on @xmath24 than in the sm .",
    "the complete vacuum polarization contributions from the higgs sector , the supersymmetric chargino - neutralino and sfermion sectors , and also the corresponding contributions in the sm have been included in our calculations @xcite .",
    "however , the supersymmetric contributions to the non - oblique corrections except in @xmath11 have been neglected .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath11 is defined from @xmath54 , the inclusive partial width for @xmath0 , as @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 is the axial - vector coupling of @xmath26 to @xmath68 @xmath73 . in the sm ,",
    "the diagrams for @xmath11 involve top quarks and @xmath74 bosons @xcite , and the contribution to @xmath11 depends quadratically on @xmath24 ( @xmath75 ) . in supersymmetric models",
    "there are additional diagrams involving higgs bosons and supersymmetric particles .",
    "the charged higgs contributions have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of a non - supersymmetric two higgs doublet model , and the contributions involving supersymmetric particles in refs .",
    "the main features of the additional supersymmetric contributions are : ( i ) a negative contribution from charged higgs  top exchange which grows as @xmath76 for @xmath77 ; ( ii ) a positive contribution from chargino - stop exchange which in this case grows as @xmath78 ; and ( iii ) a contribution from neutralino(neutral higgs)bottom exchange which grows as @xmath79 and is negligible except for large values of @xmath80 ( , @xmath81 ) ( the contribution ( iii ) has been neglected in our analysis ) .",
    "in figure 1 we present our numerical results for @xmath11 in the two sugra models . @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath6",
    "are used throughout the numerical calculations .",
    "we use the experimental value for @xmath11 , @xmath84 , determined from the latest @xmath46- analysis using the lep and slc data in ref .",
    "the discontinuity in the chargino mass in the minimal model in the figure is simply due to the use of large steps in sampling the value of @xmath85 .",
    "the values of @xmath24 are chosen in such a way that the approximate @xmath11-deduced @xmath24 bounds are readily obtained from the figure . only one value of @xmath24 is displayed in the @xmath4 sugra because considerable portion of the model predictions are overlapped for two different values of @xmath24 due to the steep rise in @xmath11 for a light chargino .",
    "the reason why the rise in @xmath11 in the @xmath4 sugra is much steeper than in the minimal @xmath3 sugra is that the stop mass scales with the chargino mass in the no - scale model whereas it does not in the minimal model . therefore , the light chargino effect in @xmath11 is optimized better in the no - scale @xmath4 sugra .",
    "this difference leads to different @xmath11-deduced @xmath24 bounds in the two models .",
    "the approximate bounds at @xmath86 c.  l. are @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath6 for the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra . in the no - scale model",
    ", one can also determine the sign on @xmath18 to be positive for @xmath89 @xmath6 .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath11 for a fixed @xmath24 represents the lowest @xmath8 for not too large @xmath8 .",
    ", the charged higgs diagram gets a significant contribution proportional to @xmath90 coming from the charged higgs coupling to @xmath91 , thereby driving @xmath11 even below the value corresponding to the lowest @xmath8 . ] it is @xmath92 @xmath10 for the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra in figure 1 . from this , we obtain low @xmath93 correlated bounds at @xmath12 c.  l. , which are for @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath94 @xmath6 in the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra .",
    "although the @xmath24 values from cdf have rather large error bars at present , one can imagine an interesting situation in the near future where the @xmath24 values from cdf turns out to fall between the above @xmath11-deduced @xmath24 bounds , disfavoring only one model .    the experimental value for @xmath2(@xmath95 ) from the 1993 lep data",
    "are reported very recently to be rather high , @xmath96 , in comparison with the sm predictions @xcite . in an attempt to see how much the situation can improve in sugra models ,",
    "we now calculate @xmath2 in the two sugra models . in terms of @xmath46 s given in ref .",
    "@xcite ] in figure 2 we show the model predictions for @xmath2 in the two models .",
    "as seen in the figure , the @xmath2 constraint is much stronger than the @xmath11 constraint .",
    "the @xmath2-deduced @xmath24 bounds at @xmath12 c.  l. are @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath6 for the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath33 ) sugra . from the figure",
    ", one can also put bounds on the chargino mass , which are @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath6 for @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath6 for the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra .",
    "similarly , one can also obtain bounds on the lighter stop mass given by @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath6 for @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath6 for the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra .",
    "therefore , in the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra , if the top turns out to be heavier than @xmath103 @xmath17 @xmath6 , then only the lighter chargino may be detected at lepii .",
    "the @xmath8-dependence is very pronounced in the no - scale model for @xmath104 .",
    "the low values of @xmath8 are as indicated in the figure . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the dotted curve becomes nearly flat as the chargino mass becomes large .",
    "this is because the charged higgs contribution nearly cancels the chargino contribution @xcite , making @xmath2 get saturated much faster to the sm value .",
    "as in the @xmath11 constraint above , the low @xmath93 correlated bounds at @xmath12 c.  l. are obtained as follows : for @xmath15 , @xmath106 @xmath17 @xmath6 in the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra . in the no - scale model",
    ", @xmath107 is excluded even at @xmath108 c.  l. for @xmath109 @xmath6 . from @xmath2 , one can also determine @xmath18 to be positive in both models .",
    "it is very interesting for one to see that the low-@xmath8 region is severely constrained by both constraints above .",
    "we would like to stress here the fact that our calculations are fairly accurate in the low-@xmath8 region because the diagrams neglected in the calculations can be safely neglected there .",
    "the major features of the constraints from @xmath11 and @xmath2 for the two sugra models are summarized in the table 1 .",
    "we have computed the one - loop electroweak corrections to the @xmath0 vertex in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the context of the minimal @xmath3 and no - scale @xmath4 supergravity models .",
    "we use the latest lep data on @xmath1 and @xmath2 in order to constrain further the two models .",
    "we find that the present lep data on @xmath1 and @xmath2 constrain the two models rather severely .",
    "especially , the low-@xmath8 region is constrained more severely .",
    "@xmath9 @xmath10 is excluded by @xmath11 at @xmath12 c.  l. for @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath6 in the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra .",
    "even more stringent constraint comes from @xmath2 .",
    "it excludes @xmath15 at @xmath12 c.  l. for @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath6 in the minimal @xmath3 ( no - scale @xmath4 ) sugra .",
    "we also find that the sign on @xmath18 in the two models can be determined from @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath12 c.  l. this can be of special interest in the minimal @xmath3 because the low-@xmath8 region is phenomenologically favored by the measured ratio @xmath110 .",
