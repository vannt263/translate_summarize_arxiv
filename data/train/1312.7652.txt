    "since gravitational waves were predicted from the theory of general relativity , a direct detection of gravitational waves had become an exciting frontier of experimental physics @xcite .",
    "the initial detection scheme was related to the resonant bar detectors @xcite which would be mechanically disturbed by passing gravitational waves , and then some other detectors which had one or more arms with its arm length influenced by passing gravitational waves were put forward . for the latter ,",
    "the virgo @xcite and ligo @xcite are the most sensitive detectors of this class as an kind of interferometer modulated by the change of the apparent distance between mirrors by passing gravitational waves .",
    "many efforts had also been made to improve the frequency range and the sensitivity of the possible probed gravitational waves , e.g. advanced ligo @xcite , and a large space - based laser interferometer gravitational wave detector , lisa @xcite . although there is no any definite and direct evidence to show the existence of gravitational waves up to now , these efforts gave an upper limit on the stochastic gravitational - wave background of cosmological origin @xcite which was considered as a realistic observable tied directly to the quantization of gravity in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "another direction of efforts to detect gravitational waves is related to the use of atomic coherence .",
    "the first scheme along this direction is migo ( matter - wave interferometric gravitational - wave observatory ) @xcite in which the atom wave is used with the same role as the photons in ligo . in particular , it was shown @xcite recently that the scheme based on migo would no better than ligo , which made the attention focused on the migo reduced to some extent . however , the appearance of migo stimulated the thoughts on using atomic interferometers to detect gravitational waves .",
    "an interesting design along the line is agis ( atomic gravitational wave interferometric sensor ) @xcite which works with a similar mechanism to ligo but replacing the macroscopic mirrors with freely falling atoms .",
    "the use of freely falling atoms or atomic interferometers as local inertial sensors reduced the requirement of elaborate seismic isolation which limits the sensitivity of ligo at hz - band or lower frequencies , so the agis have an advantage over ligo by detecting gravitational waves between 0.01 and 100 hz .",
    "however , in agis , the raman process in the atomic interferometers still induces an uncontrollable noise through the laser phase fluctuations which is also a dominant noise background for the detection of gravitational waves using ligo .",
    "the reason of existence of laser frequency noises in agis @xcite is the use of two laser beams in the interaction with the atoms , in which the pulses from the control laser are common to both interferometers and the phase contributions from this laser would be canceled in the final differential phase shift , but the noise in the phase of the passive laser can not be canceled completely .",
    "this leads to a recent suggestion @xcite for the gravitational wave detection using the similar structure to agis but replacing the local inertial sensors with single - laser atom interferometers , which overcomes the laser frequency noise existed in the gravitational wave detection using ligo but still inherits the advantages of agis to the suppression of vibration noise .    however , the measurement of interferometry is also limited by the shot noise which is related to the number of particles attending the interference process . thus following the optimistic assumption @xcite about the number of atom",
    "when operating an atomic interferometer , the shot noise is still larger in an atomic interferometer than in an optical interferometer . in particular , the typical number of photon impinging on a photo detector is easily increased than the number of atoms in an atomic interferometer .",
    "thus besides developing a new technology to increase the number of atoms , one has to use the large momentum transfer ( lmt ) @xcite to compensate for the low number of atoms . based on this background , a new method for gravitational wave detection with atomic sensors was recently suggested @xcite , which not only overcame the laser frequency noise using single - laser atomic interferometers , but also realized the lmt by adding some laser pulses between the basic beam splitter and mirror pulses .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors gave only a prototypical illumination for the mechanism realizing lmt , and did nt make the detailed analysis for the possible configurations of the new interferometer .",
    "this forms the main purpose of this paper , that is to analyze the configurations of the new interferometer and the difference of the momentum transfer for different configurations . on the other hand",
    ", we will also attempt to analyze the cancellation of laser frequency noises with a direct and explicit mathematical expression .    in order to analyze the structure of new atomic interferometers ,",
    "we introduce the sensitivity function @xcite to distinguish the different momentum transfer for different structures and thus the complex calculation for the final total phase difference using the standard method of non - relativistic quantum mechanics can be avoided .",
    "the second section of the paper will give a brief introduction of sensitivity function , in particular for its application to sense the signal about the gravitational field . in the third section",
    ", we analyze the possible configurations for the new interferometers and find some interesting phenomena for some configurations . in the fourth section , we present the results of laser frequency noise cancellation with an analysis of the total laser phase difference .",
    "in particular , we find the method of the time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) used in ref .",
    "@xcite to cancel the laser frequency noise is not applicable to the scheme suggested in ref .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in the fifth section .",
    "in this section we will revisit the sensitivity function , without loss of generality , in the time - domain atomic interferometer proposed firstly by kasevich and chu @xcite .",
    "the interferometer consists of beam splitter - mirror - beam splitter ( @xmath0 ) optical pulse sequence , and its sensitivity is limited to a large extent by the phase noise derived from the lasers as well as the residual vibrations .",
    "similar to the ref .",
    "@xcite , our investigation for the sensitivity function here is under the assumption of short laser pulses with the description of pure plane waves .    in the interferometer we considered here , the output of the results is presented by the population change of atomic number , e.g. the probability of finding the atom remained in the ground state when leaving the interferometer is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total phase difference @xcite between the two paths of the interferometer , which is also the basis of experimental observation . in a local gravitational measurement around the earth , the leading order of the signal can be calculated as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective laser - field wavevector , @xmath5 is the interrogation time between two sequent laser pulses , and @xmath6 is the local gravitational acceleration . and @xmath7 is the interferometric phase from the interaction between three laser pulses and atoms , and it is usually locked to the value @xmath8 such that the transition probability is @xmath9 which ensures the highest sensitivity to any interferometric phase fluctuations . from the perspective of the configuration , the signal can also be regarded as derived from a certain kind of interference , e.g. its influence is included in the interferometric phase @xmath10 .",
    "thus it is not hard to understand why the noises usually constrain the sensitivity of the interferometer . in the following",
    "we will consider @xmath11 and @xmath12 enters into the total phase difference as the influence of gravitational field on the interferometric phase .",
    "in particular , we will consider the same interferometer but with a single laser pulse to interact with the atom , and thus the raman process is replaced with a single photon transition and the redundant effects related to the ac stark shifts would disappear @xcite . in this case , the signal , expressed by the leading order phase shift in a local gravitational field , is proportional to the atomic energy level difference , which will be seen later .",
    "as suggested firstly by dick @xcite and then investigated in detail by cheinet , et al @xcite , the sensitivity of a time - domain atomic interferometer can be characterized by the sensitivity function which quantifies the influence of a relative laser phase shift @xmath13 occurring at a time @xmath14 during the interferometer sequence onto the transition probability @xmath15 ; it is then defined in ref .",
    "@xcite as@xmath16 if the time origin is chosen at the middle of the second raman pulse , the sensitivity function @xmath17 is an odd function .",
    "for the three pulses @xmath0 with durations respectively @xmath18 , we choose the initial time @xmath19 and the final time @xmath20 to get the expression of the sensitivity function as@xmath21{c}% \\sin(\\omega(t+t))\\ \\ \\ , -t\\leqslant t<-t+\\tau\\\\ \\",

    "as seen in fig.1 , the sensitivity function @xmath25 is indeed an odd function , so in the analysis of the next section we will present a sensitivity function with the part only for @xmath26 .",
    "usually the fourier transform of the sensitivity function is required , since the noises related closely to the analysis of the sensitivity of an interferometer can be expressed in terms of a power spectral density which is expanded with the frequency .",
    "thus the transfer function which is introduced in the appendix1 is usually used in the analysis of the sensitivity , but in the present paper we focus on the analysis of the structure of the interferometer , so the sensitivity function is enough .",
    "we will also use the transfer function when we discuss the advantages of some kinds of interferometers , e.g. the transfer of the influence of the noises .        as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can evaluate the fluctuations of the interferometric phase @xmath27 caused by an arbitrary perturbation @xmath28 by @xmath29 of course , the influence due to the atomic acceleration will be sensed by the interferometer through the sensitivity function . in general , this type of time - domain atomic interferometer discussed here is an accelerometer . in the free evolution of the atom , its phase changes by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the initial position and velocity of the atom . then using the eq .",
    "( [ ip ] ) , we recover the signal of the interferometer@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the atomic energy level difference and @xmath35 represents the terms related to @xmath36 or @xmath37 , which are tiny values compared to the leading term . if the relativistic calculation is considered as in ref . @xcite and",
    "the corresponding geodesic is used to get the phase disturbance @xmath38 , more effects will be presented . here",
    "the calculation is feasible , because the phase change of the atom induced by the gravitational field during the free evolution is equivalent to the phase change of the laser pulse by the fact that the gravitational field changes the positions of the interaction between the laser pulses and atoms . on the other hand , in the free evolution",
    ", the phase changes actually are @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy of atomic ground state and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy of atomic excited state , but after the first beam splitter , the state of atom is a superposition of the ground and excited states , so we only need to consider the change of the relative phase , @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "in this section , we will use the sensitivity function to analyze the configuration suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be understood as a variant of a light - pulse de broglie wave interferometer in mach - zender configuration .",
    "this kind of atomic interferometer is derived from the time - domain atomic interferometer introduced in the last section , but with an obvious difference by adding some pulses between the basic beam splitters and the mirror pulse which leads to a large momentum transfer ( lmt ) .",
    "all added pulses are @xmath45 pulses ( to distinguish the basic mirror @xmath45 pulse , we call these specific @xmath45 pulses ) which are refined to interact only with the required halves of atoms , unlike the three basic pulses that interact with all atoms simultaneously but with different influences on each half . in order to realize the lmt , these specific @xmath45 pulses must be arranged carefully . here we will show that for the given number of the specific @xmath45 pulses , the momentum transfer will be dependent on _ the sequence _ ( that includes the consideration of the direction of pulses and which halves of atoms will interact with the laser pulses ) and _ the time _ ( that means what time each pulse is applied ) . the case of @xmath46",
    "is used to show this .",

    ", width=312 ]    it is seen easily from the interferometer of @xmath46 that there are four specific @xmath45 pulses before the basic mirror pulse and the arrangement presented in fig.2 is the case with the largest momentum transfer . actually , there are many other ways to arrange the four @xmath45 pulses , and the final leading order phase shifts will include the possible results @xmath50 @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "there are @xmath54 possible structures in our consideration with different sequences and different times , but there is only one that can realize the largest momentum transfer , i.e. the case of the final leading order phase shift is @xmath55 .",
    "it is pointed out that the counting of all possible configurations of interferometers is based on the assumption that the laser emitter is fixed on a position or the basic beam splitters are from the same direction .",
    "then there is a natural problem : how can we know which is lmt and how many momenta are transferred .",

    "notably , for every kind of interferometer , there is only one structure to realize the largest momentum transfer , i.e. the final leading order phase shift is @xmath73 .",
    "it has to be pointed out that when the lmt interferometers amplify the signal , the noises are also amplified simultaneously , which attenuates the advantage of such interferometers .",
    "this can be seen easily from the white phase noise , and here we present a result from the vibration noises .",
    "fig.5 is a vibration spectrum measured in our lab .",

    "it is seen easily that the influence of the vibration noise is amplified to nearly 4 times the previous one .",
    "although the new interferometers with lmt amplify noises existed in the process of the interferometry , many of the noises will be cancelled when the two new interferometers are operated in a proper method , as in the case of the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "compared with the above discussion , the influence of vibration noise is @xmath76 for the configuration with the baseline @xmath77 km , which presents a very large suppression .",
    "see the schematic in fig.6 , and the consideration is similar to the refs .",
    "@xcite , with the atomic interferometers replaced by the new interferometers discussed in the last section .",
    "the laser emitter is laid at the left side and the secondary pulse is formed by the reflection from the mirror fixed at the right side . in particular ,",
    "the time interval between the primary and secondary pulses depends on the distance between the mirror and the right interferometer .",
    "the related noise analysis had been made in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular ,",
    "@xcite pointed out a remarkable point that the configuration is immune to laser frequency noise for the detection scheme of gravitational waves with the use of the new interferometers . here",
    "we find some subtle differences , which will be discussed below , e.g. the suppression of the laser frequency noise is different between the cases of @xmath47 being even and odd , for the case with the largest momentum transfer ( in the section we will only refer to the case with the largest momentum transfer , except a specific one is pointed out explicitly ) .",
    "firstly , we discuss the case for which @xmath47 is even , and assume that @xmath49 without loss of generality .",
    "this case had been introduced in the fig.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite with a @xmath78 momentum transfer , in which the phase change due to the interaction of the laser with the atom can be expressed as @xmath79 where the subscripts are associated with the seven pulses in chronological sequence .",
    "now we consider the phase change caused by the phase fluctuation @xmath28 which is due to the laser instability ( here we ignore the other noise sources such as the fluctuation from atomic coherence ) , where @xmath14 means the time that the pulse is emitted from the laser emitter since the phase of a laser does not evolve during its propagation in vacuum .",
    "a direct intuition is to use the tdi to cancel the laser frequency noise , which is also mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we find this is not feasible for the present scheme .",
    "similar to the ref .",
    "@xcite , the responses @xmath80 of the new atomic interferometers to the laser phase noise can be written as@xmath81 where for brevity we take @xmath82 , @xmath14 is chosen at the time that the final laser is emitted , and @xmath83  in the subscripts of @xmath84 represents the case of @xmath49 and @xmath85  represents the left interferometer in fig.6 . in particular , the subscripts of @xmath86 are omitted , because the laser frequency noise is only caused by the laser emitter and thus derives from the same function @xmath28 . if the laser is emitted from the left , the time of interaction between the laser and atoms in the right interferometer is delayed by @xmath87 , and vice versa . by using the method of tdi",
    ", it was expected that @xmath88 , but actually it is not true for the case we are discussing , because a calculation gives @xmath89 by using the expressions ( [ rfa1 ] ) and ( [ rfa2 ] ) .",
    "this is because for the present scheme , not all the laser pulses are emitted from the same direction , which is different from the situation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , we find that , when @xmath36 is small enough compared with @xmath90 and @xmath5 ( e.g. in a proposed experiment of ref . @xcite , @xmath91s , @xmath77 km or @xmath92ms , @xmath93s ) , the response functions can be written as@xmath94 it is found directly that @xmath95 .",
    "so one does nt need to consider any time delay , since the laser frequency noise can be cancelled at any time .",
    "note that the cancellation is subtle , e.g. the first term of @xmath84 is canceled by the second term of @xmath96 .",
    "this shows that the cancellation is better when the time internal is shorter ( it is best for no time internal as the presentation in ref .",
    "@xcite where the primary laser is triggered at time @xmath97 , and the secondary one at time @xmath98 without any time internal ) .",
    "this result can also be extended to any case for which @xmath47 is even , since in that case , the number of laser pulses from one direction is equal to that from the other one .",
    "however , we find the case for which @xmath47 is odd , is not the same .",
    "we show this by using the case of @xmath46 presented in fig.2 , and its responses @xmath80 of the new atomic interferometers to the laser phase noise can be expressed as@xmath99 again it is found that @xmath100 even though small @xmath36 is considered . in particular , it is also found that @xmath101 when the time internal @xmath36 is ignored ; this is seen as@xmath102 as expected , @xmath103 is very small since @xmath28 is a slowly varying function which is required for any laser emitter . on the other hand , since @xmath104",
    ", we might have @xmath105 by omitting the time internal @xmath90 . that is permitted if it is within the sensitivity of the interferometer .",
    "but for the detection of gravitational waves , it is expected to remain the influence happened in the time internal @xmath90 since the signal is proportional to the length @xmath90 .",
    "it is found that the reason that laser frequency noise can not be cancelled exactly for any case with @xmath47 being odd is due to the asymmetry of the number of laser pulses from the two directions .",
    "however , the laser frequency noise is suppressed to a large extent , in the scheme with lmt .",
    "finally , we will point out the difference of @xmath106 and @xmath103 operationally .",
    "@xmath106 means that for each interaction , the pulse is the same for the first and the second interferometer .",
    "such operation is easy to be understood physically for the measurement of gravitational waves .",
    "in particular , it also gets a large suppression of laser frequency noise in the present scheme .",
    "the reason that we use @xmath103 is that it leads to a complete cancellation of the laser frequency noise for the cases of even @xmath47 .",
    "but for a single interaction , such operation means the pulses used to interact with the atoms are different for the first and second interferometers .",
    "of course , it is only a choice of a proper data processing method @xcite , but we have to explain whether such operation can give the signal of gravitational waves .",
    "fortunately , the latter operation will not change the signal since the response of the first interferometer to the gravitational waves , @xmath107 , is usually treated as zero @xcite . thus @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the sensitivity function and applied it to the transfer of the signal about gravitational field around the earth through an atomic interferometer .",
    "we have also extended the application of sensitivity function to a new atomic interferometer for which we have analyzed its configuration in detail . in our analysis",
    ", we found that given the number of laser pulses , there are some different methods to realize lmt although the transferred momenta in each method are different . in particular , there is only one method that can realize the largest momentum transfer ( i.e. @xmath111 momenta transfer for a scheme with the specific @xmath47 defined in the paper ) , and in all these methods there are some configurations that gives the results of zero momentum transfer and even inverse momentum transfer ( e.g. the final leading phase shift is @xmath53 or @xmath112 ) . for the configuration in fig.6 for the detection of gravitational waves , we have also analyze how the laser frequency noise is cancelled .",
    "we found that when @xmath47 is even , the configuration is immune to the laser frequency noise with a proper data processing method ; when @xmath47 is odd , the configuration only gives a large suppression for the laser frequency noise .",

    "( [ sfft ] ) , the interferometric phase is also written as @xmath126 . after the introduction of the transfer function @xmath127 we have@xmath128 which presents clearly the process how the interferometer responds to the phase disturbance ( of course it also includes the signal ) .",
    "it is seen that if we put the fourier transform of @xmath38 into the eq .",

    "a notable feature of the transfer function @xmath129 is a low pass first order filtering , having an oscillating behavior with a periodic frequency of @xmath130 but under the cutoff frequency @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "however , the eq .",
    "( [ ftip ] ) is not usually used because most studies focused on the noise analysis while the power spectra of many noises are easier described , so the most popular is the variance of the phase fluctuation,@xmath132 where @xmath133 is the power spectral density of the phase perturbation and usually expressed as @xmath134 . it is stressed that @xmath135 is not related directly to the fluctuations of the interferometric phase , while related to the average value of @xmath27 . in particular , the average is usually taken for a long sequence of measurement cycles at a fixed repetition rate which will lead to an aliasing phenomenon similar to the dick effect @xcite in atomic clocks and increase the sensitivity of the interferometer on the low frequencies .    an immediate examination is to use the white phase noise with no frequency dependence , @xmath136 , and the result was given in the ref .",
    "@xcite and had a linear dependence on the inverse raman pulse length .",
    "but the pulse length will affect the number of the participating atoms which leads to a shot noise and limits the sensitivity of the interferometer , so the optimum pulse length must be selected with the reference to the experimental parameters .",
    "in the appendix , we will give a detailed calculation for the sensitivity function of the interferometer presented in fig.2 .",
    "considering the atom which will go through the interferometer as a two - level system whose general state can be expressed as @xmath137 with @xmath138 , the evolution of the state under the interaction with the laser pulse is calculated with the change of the coefficients @xcite,@xmath139 where @xmath22 is the rabi frequency , @xmath36 is the duration of the interaction , and @xmath86 is the relative phase change during the interaction .    for the case of @xmath46 , there are eleven pulses , and in order to calculate the sensitivity function , except the phase @xmath140 carried by the pulses themselves which could be tuned in an experiment , a random phase change @xmath13 during each interaction between the pulse and the atom may be introduced . for an illustration , we will calculate the result caused by the phase change @xmath13 at time @xmath14 during the first pulse , @xmath141 , by splitting the pulse into two pulses of duration @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "we start by assuming all atoms in the state @xmath144 , and according to the sequence presented in fig.2 , the change of the coefficients after each pulse becomes,@xmath145@xmath146@xmath147@xmath148@xmath149@xmath150 where @xmath151 , @xmath152 for the first pulse with the change by a random phase @xmath13 , and the subscripts @xmath153 , @xmath154 represent the two energy levels and 1 , 2 represent the different paths . since there is no new random phase introduced in the following ten pulses , the change of the coefficients is calculated easily according to the evolution ( [ ce ] ) .",
    "for the final pulse , we obtain the expression of @xmath155 as@xmath156 define @xmath157 , and we get the final probability of finding the atom still in state @xmath158,@xmath159\\\\ &   = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\sin\\omega(t+t)\\sin\\delta\\phi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus according to the definition ( [ sf ] ) of the sensitivity function , we have it in the time interval @xmath141 as @xmath160    then we can proceed in a similar way but the random phase change is introduced in other ten pulses to obtained the sensitivity functions for those time intervals , and thus the whole sensitivity function @xmath161 is gotten as presented in the third section of this paper .",
    "the transfer function can be obtained using ( [ tf]),@xmath162 + 2i\\sin\\omega\\tau\\lbrack 2\\sin\\omega(t-2\\tau)\\\\ &   + 3\\sin\\omega(t-4\\tau)+4\\sin\\omega(t-6\\tau)+5\\sin\\omega(t-8\\tau ) + 5\\sin8\\omega\\tau+4\\sin6\\omega\\tau\\\\ &   + 3\\sin4\\omega\\tau+2\\sin2\\omega\\tau]+12i\\sin\\frac{\\omega(t-18\\tau)}{2}% \\sin\\frac{\\omega t}{2}\\\\ &   + \\frac{2\\omega^{2}i}{\\omega^{2}-\\omega^{2}}\\cos\\omega\\tau\\lbrack-\\cos \\omega(t-4\\tau)-\\cos\\omega(t-8\\tau)+\\cos8\\omega\\tau+\\cos4\\omega\\tau],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is seen from the fig.7 .",
    "it is stressed that the data processing method is only applicable for the cancellation of laser frequency noise and whether it is feasible for the suppression of other noises has to be analyzed independently and carefully ."
