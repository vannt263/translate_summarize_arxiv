    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , i.e. those galaxies with infrared luminosity l@xmath14 , have the power output of quasars yet emit nearly all of their energy in the mid and far - infrared part of the spectrum . most ulirgs are found in interacting and merging systems ( e.g. armus , heckman & miley 1987 ; sanders , et al .",

    "three dust components are required to fit the ngc 6240 continuum spectrum .",
    "the characteristic temperatures of the three components are @xmath48k ( cold ) , @xmath49k ( warm ) , and @xmath50k ( hot ) .",
    "each component is composed of graphite and silicate grains ( with optical properties from draine & lee 1984 ) , distributed in size according to the @xmath51 model of weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) .",
    "the hot and warm components are modeled as spherically symmetric dust shells which are optically thin in the mid - infrared .",
    "the dust grains are distributed with uniform density around the central source , out to a distance of ten radial scale factors ( where the unit radius is taken to be the distance at which the equilibrium temperature of the grains is equal to the component temperature ) .",
    "the temperatures of all grains are calculated as a function of their size , composition , and distance from the illuminating source .",
    "grain sublimation is taken into account , so that the size - distribution can vary with radial distance from the central source , depending upon the temperature of the grains .",
    "the cold component is modeled as a distribution of grains immersed in a single radiation field ( i.e. , they are not radially distributed from a central source ) . as such",
    ", the grains in this component have a range of temperatures due to their varying composition and sizes , but not due to their spatial distribution .",
    "it is presumed that the cold dust is responsible for the absorption of photons from the hot and warm components .",
    "nonetheless , the emission from the cold grains is treated as optically thin since they are sufficiently cold to radiate predominantly at far - infrared wavelengths , where their opacity is extremely small .",
    "note that the range of grain temperatures due to the distribution of grain - sizes in the cold component produces an sed that is wider than that obtained with an average grain gray - body of the same temperature . in this treatment , there is therefore not a unique temperature associated with each component , as there is in a gray - body model .",
    "we instead define a  characteristic \" temperature of a component to be the temperature of the most luminous grain size at the distance from the source contributing the majority of the luminosity .",
    "this luminosity dominating distance corresponds to a @xmath52 , where approximately half of the uv - source photons have been absorbed .",
    "each component therefore contains dust above and below the characteristic temperature . with this definition ,",
    "the characteristic temperature roughly corresponds to the expected peak in the dust modified planck function .",
    "a hot dust component with a characteristic temperature of about 700k , as we have found in ngc 6240 , implies the existence of a significant number of grains near sublimation . as suggested by laurent et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , an excess of hot dust can be taken as evidence for grains heated close to sublimation in the presence of an agn . in ngc 6240 ,",
    "the presence of this hot dust together with the high - ionization lines discussed below , are consistent with this interpretation . the hottest grains in thermal equilibrium in the t@xmath53k dust component , if illuminated with an agn - like spectrum ( sanders et al .",
    "1989 ) having the bolometric luminosity of ngc 6240 , would be at a distance of about 1 pc from the central source .",
    "the hot component accounts for approximately @xmath54 of the bolometric luminosity in ngc 6240",
    ".    the optical depths to both the hot and cold dust components are essentially zero , while the screen optical depth to the warm component is @xmath55 ( effectively the silicate optical depth , since this component dominates at @xmath56 m ) , implying an a@xmath57 mag .",
    "this is about a factor of three larger than the lower limit which would be derived from a smooth continuum fit anchored at @xmath58 m , @xmath59 m and @xmath60 m , since the un - extinguished model continuum at @xmath56 m is dominated by silicate emission .",
    "the warm component accounts for about @xmath61 of the bolometric luminosity before correcting for extinction , and about @xmath62 after correcting for this extinction .    while a multi - component sed fit is never  unique \" , we have compared our best fit to alternative models which exclude a hot dust component , and which tie the optical depth to the hot dust at the value derived for the warm component .",
    "the latter is most similar to a spherical shell model wherein the hot dust is closest to the ( obscured ) nucleus and the coldest dust is responsible for most of the obscuration along the line of sight . both of these constrained fits produce significantly poorer results , producing reduced chi - squared values that are between 50% and a factor of two larger than our preferred , three component fit described above",
    ".    fits to the multiple pah emission features in ngc 6240 result in 6.2/7.7 and 11.3/7.7 flux ratios of 0.21 and 0.25 , respectively , suggesting a mix of neutral and ionized grains with between @xmath63 carbon atoms each ( draine & li 2001 ) .",
    "the 6.2/7.7 flux ratio is between that found for ngc 253 and the circinus galaxy , whereas the 11.3/7.7 flux ratio is about a factor of two , larger ( sturm et al . 2000 ; draine & li ) . the @xmath11 m pah eqw is 0.52 , about @xmath64 smaller than what is found for pure starburst galaxies ( brandl et al .",
    "2005 ) , but much larger ( a factor of @xmath65 ) than is found for agn .",
    "the pah - to - l@xmath21 lumninosity ratio is about 0.023 . in all cases ,",
    "the extinction to the pah features is assumed to be zero , as in a model where the emission arises from an extended region seen against a ( partially ) obscured continuum .",
    "note , our multiple component continuum fits produce significantly larger pah flux in features ( e.g. the 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath66 m features ) that are affected most by silicate absorptions than do other methods which employ spline fits to the observed continuum , even those anchored at relatively  clean \" parts of the spectrum .",
    "however , the fitting we have used to derive the pah fluxes in table 1 are directly comparable to the draine & li ( 2001 ) models .",
    "this will be discussed fully in marshall et al .",

    "the irs short - high and long - high spectra of ngc 6240 are dominated by unresolved atomic , fine - structure lines of ne , o , si , s , and fe , covering a large range in ionization potential , ( figs . 1b,1c and table 1 ) .",
    "the [ feii ] lines at 5.34 and @xmath67 m ( partially blended with [ oiv ] @xmath24 m ) are particularly strong in ngc 6240 as compared to other ulirgs and starburst galaxies , as has been noted by lutz et al .",

    "the detection of a hot dust component , which is not seen in irs spectra of starburst galaxies ( brandl et al .",

    "correcting the measured [ nev ] emission by an a@xmath115 mag would produce an intrinsic [ nev]/ir flux ratio in ngc 6240 well above any other known agn or ulirg , so the hard x - ray derived extinction is not applicable . from our sed fit ,",
    "the extinction to the warm dust is a@xmath116 mag . while large , this is still likely to be a lower limit to some lines of sight to the circum - nuclear region directly excited by the agn",
    "however , if we assume a@xmath117 mag to the coronal line region , and an intrinsic [ nev]/[neii ] line flux ratio of 1.0 for this agn - heated gas , we derive a corrected [ nev]/[neii ] ratio of 0.24 ( or 0.20 if we also extinction correct the [ neii ] which is excited by the agn ) .",
    "this implies the  intrinsic \" agn contribution is likely to be between @xmath118 , a number which is within the range estimated from the fits to the extinction - corrected , hard x - ray data .",
