    "in a mean - field framework @xcite , the presence of low - lying @xmath1 states in the spectrum of an even - even nucleus is usually interpreted as the manifestation of shape coexistence @xcite : each of the @xmath1 states , including the ground state , corresponds to a mean - field configuration of a different shape .",
    "nuclei around the neutron deficient kr and sr have very early been considered as among the most favorable ones for the presence of shape coexistence .",
    "first studies were performed for @xmath2kr and a few neighboring odd nuclei with the help of the nilsson - strutinsky approach @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations have been carried out since then with an improved microscopic - macroscopic model @xcite and with self - consistent mean - field models using non - relativistic skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite interactions , as well as relativistic lagrangians @xcite .",
    "they confirm the presence of oblate and prolate minima in the deformation energy surface of some light kr , sr and zr isotopes .",
    "the existence of nearly - degenerate structures corresponding to different deformations raises immediately the question of their stability against dynamical effets beyond a mean - field approach .",
    "one can expect that the physical states result in fact from a mixing of states with spherical , prolate and oblate deformations .",
    "such mixings were obtained from models with parameters specifically adjusted to the data : the proton - neutron interacting boson model ( iba-2 ) @xcite , and a bohr - hamiltonian calculation built on a microscopic - macroscopic model @xcite .",
    "an alternative to a mean - field description of shape coexistence is given by the shell model .",
    "however , the number of active particles and holes necessary to describe the neutron - deficient kr isotopes is prohibitively large , and this mass region is out of reach of the conventional shell model .",
    "the problem is tractable in models performing a clever truncation of the configuration space as in the complex excited vampir approach using a phenomenologically modified nuclear matter @xmath3 matrix as residual interaction @xcite , or in the shell - model monte carlo ( smmc ) method .",
    "a smmc calculation using a schematic pairing+quadrupole interaction is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first experimental evidence for ground - state deformation in neutron - deficient kr isotopes was found in ref .",
    "subsequent experiments revealed the rich structure of the low - lying excitation spectrum in these nuclei , with coexisting and mixed bands in @xmath0kr @xcite .",
    "many more data on transition probabilities , both in and out of bands , have also now become available @xcite .",
    "the description of such nuclei is a challenge for nuclear structure models . in general",
    ", their excitation spectrum varies very rapidly along a given isotopic line . for this reason",
    ", they constitute a testing ground for beyond - mean - field approaches built on skyrme - hartree - fock @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present an application of an angular momentum projected generator coordinate method to the description of the low - energy excitations in @xmath0kr . at present ,",
    "our implementation of the method is limited to axial mean - field states which are invariant under spatial inversion and time reversal .",
    "applications of the same method to shape coexistence in neutron - deficient pb isotopes were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . a good qualitative agreement with the data",
    "was obtained , in particular for the relative position of the coexisting bands which result from a mixing of oblate , spherical and prolate configurations .",
    "however , the mixing is extremely sensitive to many details of the model and on the effective interaction , preventing a detailed quantitative agreement with the data . compared to the neutron - deficient pb isotopes , the description of the neutron - deficient kr isotopes looks simpler .",
    "the coexisting bands result from the mixing of only two kinds of structures , oblate and prolate . the number of spherical @xmath4 shells which contribute to the shell structure is smaller than for pb , and the shells are the same for neutrons and protons .",
    "it is therefore easier to relate the collective states to the underlying mean - field .",
    "our calculated values presented below have already been used for comparison in the experimental report of refs.@xcite .",
    "the starting point of our method is a set of axial hf+bcs wave functions .",
    "they are generated by self - consistent mean - field calculations on a three - dimensional mesh in coordinate space @xcite , with a constraint on a collective coordinate , the axial quadrupole moment @xmath5 . in a spherical nuclear shell model picture ,",
    "such mean - field states incorporate particle - particle correlations through pairing and many - particle many - hole correlations through nuclear deformation . as a result ,",
    "the mean - field states break several symmetries of the exact many - body states .",
    "these symmetry violations make difficult the connection between mean - field results , expressed in the intrinsic frame of reference of the nucleus , and spectroscopic data , obtained in the laboratory frame of reference .",
    "this motivates the second step of our method , the restoration of the symmetries associated with particle numbers and rotation .",
    "another ambiguity in the interpretation of mean - field results arises when the deformation energy varies slowly as a function of a shape degree of freedom , in particular when a potential energy surface presents several minima separated by a low barrier .",
    "in such a case , to assign a physical state to each minimum is not a well - founded approximation .",
    "this problem is eliminated by the third step of our method : for each angular momentum , states obtained by projecting mean - field configurations of different deformation are used as the generating functions of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "the weight coefficients of the mixing are determined by varying the energy and by solving the hill - wheeler - griffin equation @xcite .",
    "the configuration mixing removes the contribution of vibrational excitations from the ground state wave function .",
    "it permits also to construct a spectrum of excited states .",
    "a detailed introduction to the method has been given in ref  @xcite .",
    "the same effective interaction is used to generate the mean - field states and to perform the configuration mixing : the skyrme interaction sly6 @xcite in the particle - hole channel and a density - dependent , zero - range interaction in the pairing channel . as required by the sly6 parametrization ,",
    "the full two - body center - of - mass correction is included in the variational equations to generate the mean - field and in the calculation of the projected gcm energies .",
    "the strength of the pairing interaction is the same as in previous studies of light and medium - mass nuclei , i.e.  @xmath6 mev @xmath7 for protons and neutrons in connection with cutoffs above and below the fermi energy , as defined in ref .",
    "similar implementations of angular - momentum projected gcm have been developed also for the non - relativistic gogny interaction @xcite and for relativistic mean - field lagrangians @xcite .    to define a dimensionless deformation parameter",
    ", we use the sharp edge liquid drop relation between the axial quadrupole moment @xmath8 and a parameter @xmath9 @xmath10 with .",
    "the mass dependence of the quadrupole moment is partly removed in this parameter @xmath11 .",
    "it should not be compared with the multipole expansion parameters that are used in microscopic - macroscopic models whose origin is not the same and usually are significantly smaller .    with our method , @xmath12 values for in - band and out - of - band transitions as well as spectroscopic multipole moments",
    "@xmath13 are determined directly in the laboratory frame of reference  @xcite .",
    "as we use the full model space of occupied states , we neither have to distinguish between valence particles and a core , nor is there a need for effective charges .    to make a comparison with other approaches easier",
    ", it is useful to define quantities similar to intrinsic frame deformations from the spectroscopic and transition moments .",
    "an intrinsic transition charge quadrupole moment @xmath14 can be derived from the @xmath15 values within the static rotor model @xmath16 in the same way , an intrinsic charge quadrupole moment can be related to the spectroscopic quadrupole moment @xmath17 via the relation @xmath18 for axially - symmetric shapes , i.e.  pure states , this relation reduces to @xmath19 , with a change of sign between @xmath20 and @xmath17 .",
    "dimensionless deformation parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be determined from @xmath14 and @xmath20 , respectively , through an equation similar to eq .",

    "@xmath20 and @xmath14 measure different properties : @xmath20 depends on a single state , while @xmath14 probes the geometry of the initial and final states whose wave functions can correspond to very different mixings of projected mean - field states . in general , these two moments take different values .",
    "their near equality indicates that the assumptions of the static - rotor model are fulfilled , i.e.  a well - deformed rotational band not mixed with other bands .",

    "figure [ fig : kr74:spe ] provides the nilsson diagram of the self - consistent single - particle energies for neutrons .",
    "the diagram for protons looks very similar , but shifted in energy .",
    "one can see two main differences with the single - particle energies used in some other methods . in the woods - saxon and the folded - yukawa potentials used in the microscopic - macroscopic calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively , as in the woods - saxon potential used to generate the single - particle spectrum for the smmc calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 levels are closer to the @xmath28 level by approximately 2 mev and the separation between the @xmath29 and the @xmath28 levels is larger . as a result , the @xmath26 and the @xmath29 levels are much closer and their order is even changed in the case of the latter two models .",
    "these modifications have a strong effect on the deformed gaps which may correspond to quite different deformations and vary in size . the spin - orbit splitting for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 levels in the three potentials",
    "are very similar to ours .",

    "however , it should not be misinterpreted as an observable . with our method ,",
    "one calculates transition and spectroscopic multipole moments in the laboratory frame , which can be directly compared to experimental data .",
    "however , the spectroscopic moments which characterize a state do not provide useful coordinates to plot potential energy curves as they scale with angular momentum and are even identically zero for @xmath32 . for projected states with and large intrinsic deformation in nuclei with a larger than 100",
    ", @xmath9 is very close to the intrinsic deformation @xmath22 determined from the laboratory frame quadrupole moment @xmath20 through the static rotor model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qs ] ) .",
    "note that any coordinate might be misleading for the gcm , as the metric is related to the inverse of the overlap matrix , which has no direct connection to any deformation .",
    "the mean - field energy landscapes ( dotted lines in fig.[fig : all : pes ] ) show that the energies of the four nuclei vary very slowly with deformation .",
    "our calculations predict also a transition from a nucleus with coexisting prolate and oblate minima in @xmath2kr to a soft , spherical , anharmonic vibrator in @xmath33kr .",
    "the many shallow local minima and plateaus in the total energy curves can be directly related to the gaps in the nilsson diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : kr74:spe ] .    the two minima in the mean - field energy curve ( dotted line ) of @xmath25kr reflect the gaps in the nilsson diagram at small oblate and large prolate deformations .",
    "for @xmath34kr , the spherical mean - field minimum is related to the large spherical subshell closure , while the shallow oblate and prolate structures correspond to two deformed gaps in the nilsson diagram .",
    "the prolate minimum has moved to smaller deformation than in @xmath25kr , the deformed gap being at larger deformations than the gap .",
    "the spherical subshell closure is strong enough to stabilize the spherical shape up to the isotope @xmath33kr .    as can be seen from the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : all : pes ] , the energy landscapes are qualitatively modified by the projection on . since a spherical mean - field state is already a state , the energy gain by projecting it on angular momentum is zero while the projection of a deformed mean - field state always leads to an energy gain , which increases very rapidly at small deformation . in",
    "almost all spherical and soft nuclei , this creates minima at prolate and oblate deformations with @xmath35 values around 0.1 .",
    "these states usually have a large overlap close to 1 , which means they are not two different states , but represent the same one , which can be associated with a `` correlated spherical state '' . in nuclei with shallow mean - field minima at small deformations as the kr isotopes , the projection merges this near - spherical spherical minimum with the slightly oblate one into a broad structure .",
    "the prolate mean - field minimum being at larger deformation , two distinct structures appear on the prolate side in @xmath36kr , a `` spherical '' one at a @xmath11 value around 0.15 , and a well - deformed one at a @xmath11 value around 0.5",
    ".    the topology of the @xmath2kr energy surface on the oblate side can hardly be explained by a single large oblate gap in the nilsson diagram .",
    "the mean - field and @xmath32 minima at large oblate deformations seem to result from a delicate balance of shell effects from @xmath37 to @xmath38 which reduce the level density around the fermi surface sufficiently to create a shallow oblate minimum and a very soft energy surface .",
    "the shallow minimum on the prolate side can be associated with two close gaps .",
    "the fact that the structures in the potential landscapes can be easily associated with gaps in a nilsson diagram is an attractive feature of our approach which makes straightforward the connection with simpler models .",
    "this is an advantage compared to the interacting shell model , in which states are constructed as non - intuitive @xmath39p-@xmath39h states in a spherical basis .",
    "one can wonder whether it is meaningful to restrict the description of the light kr isotopes to axial shapes .",
    "there have been a few explorations of the triaxial degree of freedom which can help to answer this question .",
    "_  @xcite have calculated the potential landscape of @xmath2kr along several shape degrees of freedom , including non - axial octupole deformations , using the skyrme siii interaction .",
    "their potential energy curve is similar to ours for purely quadrupole axial deformations .",
    "they found that the prolate and oblate energy minima are separated by a triaxial barrier of 500 kev , and that the oblate shapes are soft with respect to non - axial octupole deformations .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have obtained rather large triaxial barriers for @xmath25kr and @xmath34kr , also using the siii interaction .",
    "let us also mention that almehed and walet @xcite have self - consistently determined a collective path in @xmath2kr for different values of the angular momentum in a small model space using a schematic interaction . for , they obtain a purely axial path that connects the oblate ground state and the prolate minimum . for",
    ", the path that they obtain does not cross the spherical configuration and makes a small excursion through triaxiality , as can be expected from the projected energy curves .",
    "from these studies of triaxiality , one can conclude that in most models , the oblate and prolate minima found as a function of the axial quadrupole moment are true minima .",
    "the barrier between the minima in the @xmath40 degree of freedom may not be very high , but to restrict the model to axial symmetry can be expected to provide a valid first approximation .",

    "for higher @xmath46 values , the mixing between oblate and prolate configurations is less pronounced and the value of @xmath41 represents better the structure of the states .    as could be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : all : pes ] , the projected energy curve for @xmath25kr presents two nearly degenerate minima at oblate and large prolate deformations , and a third shallow excited minimum at small deformation .",

    "the near degeneracy of the oblate and prolate minima is lifted , the first excited @xmath1 state having an excitation energy of 0.49 mev .",
    "the situation becomes simpler for larger angular momenta .",
    "the first @xmath47 level still strongly mixes prolate and oblate deformations and has a wave function rather similar to the first excited @xmath1 state . on the contrary , the second @xmath47 state is mainly constructed from oblate mean - field configurations projected on with a negative mean deformation larger in modulus than that of the ground state .",
    "the two first @xmath48 and @xmath49 states are dominated by only prolate or oblate deformations .",
    "one can thus expect that an approximation based on a fixed mean - field configuration , like the cranked mean - field methods , is justified beyond .",
    "the nodal structure of the collective wave function is more complicated than the structure that one would obtain in a one - dimensional potential well .",
    "it reflects the fact that the rotation of a deformed wave function around the @xmath50-axis generates wave functions which can not be represented along a single axis : the exchange of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 axes generates prolate and oblate shapes for two different values of the angle @xmath40 .",
    "for this reason , the angular - momentum projected gcm wave functions is not one - dimensional , even when only axial states are mixed @xcite .",
    "@xmath25kr provides an excellent example that a comparison between the intrinsic deformation of a mean - field minimum and the transition quadrupole moment derived from a @xmath15 value might be misleading .",
    "there are three reasons for that : ( i ) for light and medium - mass nuclei , the minima of the projected energy curve are usually at larger prolate and oblate deformations than the minima of the mean - field energy curve , ( ii ) the minima of the projected and energy curves correspond to the projection of mean - field states with different deformation and the assumption of a static rotor is not valid at low angular momentum , and ( iii ) the wave functions of the low - lying states are quite broad and strongly mix oblate or prolate configurations ; moreover , the mixing is different for the @xmath1 states and @xmath47 states .",
    "a schematic two - level - mixing model has been used by becker _ et al._@xcite to analyze the experimental data . in this model ,",
    "the energies of `` pure '' prolate and oblate configurations are deduced from an extrapolation to low spins of the high spin parts of the bands .",
    "this is valid if configuration mixing decreases with spin , which seems reasonable in view of our results .",
    "data are described well by assuming that the unperturbed levels are nearly degenerate with only a 20 kev energy difference .",
    "this leads to nearly equal contributions from the oblate and prolate unperturbed states .",

    "the standard interpretation is that the ground states have an increasing admixture of prolate states of large deformation when going to more neutron - deficient nuclei , which overcompensates the volume effect of decreasing mass .",

    "work in these various directions is underway .",
    "* our study of neutron - deficient kr isotopes clearly points at a problem with the sly effective interactions in the @xmath95 shell , related to the relative position of a few single - particle levels .    as already discussed in the literature , ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) , the spectroscopic properties of the neutron - deficient kr region are extremely sensitive to the details of the shell structure .",
    "the number of levels around the fermi energy is quite small which results in several shell gaps for every neutron and proton number from 34 to 42 .",
    "any change in the relative position of levels and of their ordering will modify the size and deformation of the gaps in fig .",
    "[ fig : kr74:spe ] .",
    "our results , and those of models with adjustable single - particle spectra that perform better for kr isotopes , suggest a few necessary modifications of the single - particle spectra obtained with the sly6 skyrme parametrization :    * the experimental evidence that there are no spherical @xmath1 states in the spectrum of @xmath34kr shows that the spherical shell gap is too strong .",
    "this is consistent with our results for the region obtained in a systematic study of mass and deformation where the ground state for @xmath96zr was obtained spherical with a very pronounced shell effect @xcite , while experiment suggests that is a well - deformed rotor @xcite .",
    "a @xmath28 level closer to the @xmath27 orbital would decrease the spherical gap .",
    "it would also decrease the oblate gap , and shift the prolate gap to smaller deformation , probably reducing the deformation of @xmath25kr . * taking the wodds - saxon single - particle level schemes of  fig .",
    "17 in @xcite as an example , a decrease of the separation between the @xmath29 and the @xmath26 levels should change the single - particle spectra at small prolate deformation : a gap at that extends from oblate shapes to prolate shapes would replace the gap at around @xmath97 . it can be expected that this would drive @xmath25kr towards prolate shapes .",
    "we have checked that all modern successful skyrme interactions give single - particle spectra in the @xmath95 shell which are similar to those obtained with sly6 .",
    "this points to a deficiency of the standard skyrme interaction in general and not to a difficulty intrinsic to sly6 .",
    "other models as the relativistic mean - field model ( rmf ) might seem to work more satisfactorily in the @xmath95 shell and to predict potential landscapes in better qualitative agreement with the kr data than ours @xcite .",
    "however , those models do not describe correctly the neutron - deficient pb region @xcite , where many skyrme forces perform quite well @xcite .",
    "altogether , the present study confirms the conclusions drawn in @xcite that the current functional form of the skyrme energy functional is not yet flexible enough to cover the relevant aspects of nuclear structure with the same good quality for all regions of the nuclear chart .    the combined analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig : kr74:spe ] and [ fig : all : pes ] suggests that the structure of collective states in the neutron - deficient krypton isotopes provides a sensitive testing ground for future attempts to construct better effective interactions .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that a tensor interaction , absent in the existing standard mean - field models , introduces a particle - number dependence of single - particle spectra @xcite , that might resolve at least some of the deficiencies in the @xmath95 shell we encounter here , and that are known for other regions of the nuclear chart .",
