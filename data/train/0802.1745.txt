    "<S> the application of superscaling ideas to predict neutral - current ( nc ) quasielastic ( qe ) neutrino cross sections is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained within the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) using the same relativistic mean field potential ( rmf ) for both initial and final nucleons  a model that reproduces the experimental @xmath0 scaling function  are used to illustrate the ideas involved . while nc reactions are not so well suited for scaling analyses , to a large extent the ria - rmf predictions do exhibit superscaling . </S>",
    "<S> independence of the scaled response on the nuclear species is very well fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> the ria - rmf nc superscaling function is in good agreement with the experimental @xmath0 one . </S>",
    "<S> the idea that electroweak processes can be described with a universal scaling function , provided that mild restrictions on the kinematics are assumed , is shown to be valid .    </S>",
    "<S> analyses of on - going and future experimental studies of neutrino reactions and oscillations at intermediate energies  @xcite inevitably involve nuclear targets and require accurate control of nuclear effects . </S>",
    "<S> one way of taking nuclear effects into account is by directly modeling them . </S>",
    "<S> this approach can predict the bulk of the neutrino - nucleus response , but is not capable of yielding predictions of high enough accuracy , given the present experimental demands . </S>",
    "<S> a second approach that has been recently proposed takes advantage of scaling ideas . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , scaling has been extensively employed to analyze inclusive qe electron - nucleus scattering data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data , when appropriately organized , scale to a function that is not only relatively independent of the momentum transfer ( scaling of the first kind ) , but also independent of the nuclear target ( scaling of the second kind ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous occurrence of both kinds of scaling is known as superscaling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on these ideas , a phenomenological superscaling approach ( susa )  @xcite can be pursued that provides a more robust way to inter - relate the various classes of electroweak processes than most direct modeling does , as long as the kinematics chosen lie in the regions where scaling applies , i.e. , qe kinematics for transferred momentum in the range from roughly 500 mev / c to a few gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> within susa , one assumes that _ at similar kinematics _ both electron and neutrino mediated inclusive scattering reactions share the same universal scaling function , which contains the relevant information about the initial and final state nuclear dynamics explored by the probe , thereby allowing one to provide reliable and relatively model - independent predictions for neutrino - induced processes employing the @xmath0 experimental scaling function as input  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to date , most applications of scaling ideas to neutrino - nucleus cross sections involved charged current ( cc ) processes , whose kinematics parallel the electron scattering case . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interaction of neutrinos with matter is mediated not only by @xmath1 bosons , but also by the neutral @xmath2 boson . </S>",
    "<S> nc processes are relevant for oscillation experiments  for instance , it is expected that they contribute as the third most important event type for the miniboone experiment at fermilab  @xcite . as in the case of cc processes , predictions based on scaling ideas , when possible , are clearly demanded . </S>",
    "<S> the identification of cc events is relatively simple via the outgoing _ charged _ lepton , similar to what happens in inclusive @xmath0 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the energy and momentum transferred at the leptonic vertex are known and thus the scaling analysis of cc neutrino - nucleus cross sections proceeds in a way identical to the electron case . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of nc events , the scattered neutrino is not detected and identification of the nc event is usually made when i ) no final charged lepton is found and ii ) a nucleon ejected from the nucleus is detected . even in the case that the nucleon energy and momentum can be measured , the transferred energy and momentum at the leptonic vertex will remain unknown . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the nc process is thus different from both electron scattering and its cc neutrino counterpart , rendering the derivation of scaling less obvious . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the translation of the scaling analysis to nc processes was recently outlined in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there it was shown that the superscaling analysis of nc reactions in the case of the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) and scattering of 1 gev neutrinos from @xmath3c is feasible . </S>",
    "<S> said study showed how to extend the scaling analysis to nc processes . </S>",
    "<S> the rfg @xmath0 response exhibits perfect superscaling by definition  @xcite , but it is not in accord with the magnitude or with the shape of the experimental scaling function . it has been shown that strong final - state interactions ( fsi ) are needed to describe successfully the magnitude and shape of the superscaled data , introducing also small deviations from the extracted superscaling behaviour .    in this letter , we address two crucial questions which arise when extending susa analyses to nc neutrino scattering in the qe region : i ) does superscaling hold for nc neutrino - nucleus cross sections when strong fsi are present ? </S>",
    "<S> if so , ii ) can the @xmath0 experimental scaling function be employed to predict nc cross sections , in spite of the intrinsic differences between the two processes ? to answer these questions , being aware of </S>",
    "<S> how scarce nc neutrino - nucleus cross section data are , we use predictions from the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria )  @xcite , based on strong relativistic mean field potentials for both the bound and ejected nucleons ( ria - rmf ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model , as well as its corresponding semirelativistic version  @xcite , reproduces the shape and magnitude of the experimental scaling curve extracted from qe @xmath0 data , elusive for other theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , ria - rmf predicts a universal scaling function for both electron and cc neutrino scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we verify for the first time that nc qe neutrino cross sections exhibit superscaling properties even in presence of strong fsi . insights into the universal character of the scaling function , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ the existence of a unique function that simultaneously describes qe electron , cc and nc neutrino scattering on nuclei , are also provided .    in nc qe </S>",
    "<S> neutrino scattering an outgoing nucleon ( mass @xmath4 ) having energy @xmath5 , kinetic energy @xmath6 and angle @xmath7 with respect to the momentum @xmath8 of the beam is assumed to be detected . </S>",
    "<S> the beam energy @xmath9 is also assumed to be known . </S>",
    "<S> these variables determine the kinematics of the process  @xcite . with regards to the model </S>",
    "<S> we employ , the nc qe neutrino - nucleus scattering is described within the impulse approximation ( ia ) , where the nuclear current is written as a sum of single - nucleon currents . </S>",
    "<S> the bound nucleon states are given as self - consistent dirac - hartree solutions , derived within a rmf approach using a lagrangian containing @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fsi effects are included by means of the same strong rmf potentials that describe the initial bound states . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed description of the model can be found in  @xcite .    as usual in scaling analyses of qe scattering , we assume the inclusive @xmath13 cross section to be obtained as the integrated semi - inclusive one - nucleon ( proton or neutron ) knockout @xmath14 cross sections . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show the strong dependence of nc neutrino qe inclusive cross sections on the beam energy ( provided that    @xmath7 is fixed ) , and on the target selected . </S>",
    "<S> the results are obtained with the ria - rmf model ; however a large amount of this variation is essentially due to the neutrino - nucleus coupling strength and the variation in the position of the quasielastic peak for the different beam energies . </S>",
    "<S> if superscaling holds , most of this dependence disappears when dividing these cross sections by the nc single - nucleon cross section given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 20 ) of @xcite and plotting against the dimensionless scaling variable @xmath15 extracted from the rfg analysis in nc kinematics ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 26 ) in @xcite for its explicit expression ) . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in nuclear species should also be taken into account by the superscaling analysis . </S>",
    "<S> results for the so - obtained scaling function @xmath16 are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .    in the left - hand panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , one can see that first - kind scaling is well respected within ria - rmf in the region of negative @xmath15-values . in other words , the large variations in the cross sections observed for different neutrino energies , are accounted for by the single - nucleon part of the cross sections , which has been factored - out in obtaining the scaling function . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the peak of the superscaling response appears approximately at the same point for all the kinematics </S>",
    "<S> . however , first - kind scaling is not perfect , as there is a sizeable increase in the height of the peaks of the curves , as well as a shift to @xmath17 for increasing beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to what is observed in ria - rmf for the inclusive @xmath0 case . actually , the experimental @xmath0 data do leave room for some breaking of first - kind scaling in the region of positive scaling variable . </S>",
    "<S> first - kind scaling is very well fulfilled for electron , cc and nc cases _ in the absence of fsi _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the breakdown of scaling in fig .  2 must be ascribed ( within ia ) to fsi . in the plane - wave limit , the dependence of the cross section on the energy of the outgoing nucleon comes mainly from kinematical effects that are taken into account in the scaling analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> fsi involve a redistribution of strength that depends on the energy of the final nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , fsi introduce an additional , non - kinematical , dependence of the cross section on @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> if the kinematics of the process are such that the range of energies of the ejected nucleon depends strongly on the beam energy , the nucleon will be subject to different fsi for each @xmath9 , and a visible breakdown of first - kind scaling will show up . </S>",
    "<S> this is what happens for @xmath19 , where there is a strong shift of the position of the peak of the cross section with incoming beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , for those kinematics for which the range of @xmath18 remains approximately the same when considering different beam energies , first - kind scaling is obtained even with fsi included , as fsi effects on the knockout nucleon are similar for different beam energies .    </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , in fig .  2 we also observe that @xmath16 is , for pure kinematical reasons , a bivalued function of the scaling variable @xmath15 , as the same value of @xmath15 is obtained , at fixed beam energy and nucleon angle , for two different values of the outgoing nucleon energy . in the absence of fsi ( as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , superscaling is a good approximation and the two values of the superscaling function for these @xmath15 are nearly equal . when fsi are present , and if the kinematics prevents superscaling , the bivalued nature of the superscaled function is revealed .    in order to understand for what kinematics good scaling of the first kind </S>",
    "<S> is reached even in presence of strong fsi , we look at the case of free nucleons . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows how @xmath7 and @xmath18 are related due to energy and momentum conservation for several beam energies . for bound nucleons , neglecting fermi motion , the cross section will be peaked at approximately the same @xmath18 value . from the figure one sees that the range of @xmath18 spanned at fixed @xmath7 for varying @xmath9 is reduced for large angles and thus scaling of the first - kind will be much better obeyed . in general , smaller angles show larger first - kind scaling violations , while larger angles exhibit almost perfect first - kind scaling  @xcite . note that this result comes through purely kinematical reasoning and thus is model - independent to the extent that the cross section can be described within ia .    </S>",
    "<S> results for scaling of the second kind are presented in the right - hand panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the superscaling functions obtained for several nuclei are almost identical , in spite of the strong difference in magnitude of the corresponding cross sections ( _ cf . _ </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the dependence on the nuclear species is well accounted for by the superscaling analysis . </S>",
    "<S> scaling of second kind is seen to be very robust , thereby opening up a means of taking into account nuclear effects for different nuclei employing superscaling ideas .    </S>",
    "<S> the superscaling properties exhibited by nc qe neutrino - nucleus scattering suggest exploring the validity of the universal character of the scaling function for inclusive electroweak processes on nuclei , using either electrons or cc and nc neutrino probes . to the extent that this universality holds , the phenomenological susa approach formerly applied to predict cc neutrino - nucleus cross sections </S>",
    "<S> could also provide reliable , largely model - independent predictions for nc processes .    in order to study whether or not this universality assumption holds also for nc processes , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we compare the ria - rmf nc superscaling function with the averaged qe experimental function obtained from the analysis of @xmath0 data , together with a phenomenological parameterization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ria - rmf superscaling function has been plotted for two values of @xmath7 for which scaling of first - kind is well fulfilled ( 60@xmath20 ) or not - so - well ( 40@xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown for two beam energies . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the model gives rise to a nc scaling function that follows closely the behaviour of the @xmath0 function and the bivalued behaviour of the superscaling function is hardly visible whenever superscaling is well respected ( 60@xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of 40@xmath20 , breakdown of first - kind scaling is clear , the departure from the susa @xmath0 response visible and the bivalued nature of the nc superscaled function is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that all curves would coincide if superscaling was exactly fulfilled in both nc and @xmath0 cases . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath0 and nc scaling curves are obtained under rather different kinematical situations , the scaling curves depart from each other when superscaling is not a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the assumption that , under proper kinematics restrictions , a universal qe scaling function exists which is valid not only for inclusive electron and cc neutrino reactions , as seen in  @xcite , but also for nc processes .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have established sufficient conditions under which a universal superscaling function could be applied both to electron and neutrino ( cc or nc ) inclusive scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions refer to the fact that the kinematics must be such that the range of energies spanned by the ejected nucleon is nearly independent of the incoming neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> this happens , for instance , when the angle of the ejected nucleon with regards to the beam is larger than roughly @xmath21 , which happens to be the region where the cross section integrated over angles has larger values . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , first - kind scaling is well respected at the 10@xmath22 level even in the presence of strong fsi , and the good comparison with the experimental @xmath0 scaling function gives us confidence that susa can be extended to predict nc qe neutrino cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note that even though we have illustrated this study within the ria - rmf model that contains strong fsi and is quite successful in reproducing the experimental electron scattering scaling function , the kinematical conditions that grant the validity of susa are model independent when the ia can be safely applied , that is under qe kinematics with neutrino beam energies from @xmath23 mev up to a few gev . </S>"
