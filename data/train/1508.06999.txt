    "evolved stars are important drivers of the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies . in our own galaxy dust enrichment of the ism is dominated by the dusty winds from low- to intermediate mass stars ( 18 @xmath0 ) during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of evolution @xcite . at lower metallicities",
    "the relative contribution from high mass stars ( @xmath1 ) becomes important , and a significant period of dust production from these high - mass sources , via their stellar winds or directly in the supernova ( sn ) ejecta , is often invoked to explain the substantial dust abundances observed in high - redshift galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "dust production at low - metallicities is only just beginning to be understood , due primarily to recent galaxy - wide surveys of nearby low metallicity systems such as the magellanic clouds ( mc ) . the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) , with metallicities of 0.5 and 0.2 @xmath2 @xcite , are ideally suited to such investigations , due to their proximity ( 50 and 60 kpc ; @xcite ) , favorable viewing angle ( 35@xmath3 for the lmc ; @xcite ) and low average reddening along the line - of - sight ( @xmath4 @xmath5 0.08 and 0.04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resolved stellar populations of the magellanic clouds have been well studied over a wide wavelength range from the optical to the far - infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as these surveys cover the full spatial extent of each galaxy , a complete picture of the mass - losing stellar populations in the magellanic clouds can been obtained .",
    "the dust - injection rate from low - mass stars in the magellanic clouds has been estimated by @xcite , using mid - ir fluxes which are sensitive to warm ( @xmath5 100 k ) dust . to compile a complete inventory of dust producers and",
    "fully characterise the stellar dust return to the ism , the far - infrared ( ir ; 50250 @xmath6 m ) and sub - millimeter ( submm ; ( @xmath7 @xmath8250 @xmath6 m ) emission from cold dust ( t @xmath9 50 k ) envelopes associated with stars in an evolved stage of stellar evolution must also be constrained .",
    "using data from the _ herschel _ inventory of the agents of galaxy evolution in the magellanic clouds open time key project ( heritage ; @xcite ) , @xcite created a _",

    "they classify the sources in the bmc and find that the brightest heritage sources are predominately young stellar objects ( ysos ) while the faintest are background galaxies .",
    "intriguingly , they provisionally identify a smaller population ( @xmath5500 ) of very dusty stars , in the later stages of stellar evolution ( e.g.  extreme agb stars , post - agb ( pagb ) objects , planetary nebulae ( pne ) and supernova remnants ( snr ) ) , although the majority of these sources have also been identified as ysos in other studies .    in the milky way ,",
    "the _ herschel _ key program mess ( mass loss of evolved stars ; @xcite ) , has observed a representative sample of low- and intermediate - mass and high - mass post - main sequence objects , across a range of mass - loss rates .",
    "they find that extended structure in the far - ir is commonly seen around agb stars and their remnants @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of a significant number of evolved stars detected in the heritage survey is unexpected , as it was predicted that the majority of these sources in the magellanic clouds would fall below the _ herschel _ sensitivity limit @xcite . only the most luminous",
    ", heavily dust enshrouded evolved stars were expected to have a detectable submm emission .",
    "the cold circumstellar envelopes of two massive evolved stars ( r71 and iras 052806910 ) in the lmc have been detected with _",
    "however , @xcite attribute this emission to swept - up ism dust rather than from dust produced by the stars themselves .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the @xmath5500 evolved star candidates with a submm excess in the magellanic clouds identified using data from the _ herschel _ heritage - bmc @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the observational data is summarized in section  [ sec : data ] . in section  [ sec : sampleselect ] we describe the selection of post - main - sequence stars from the heritage - bmc ; in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of this search and discuss the different post - main - sequence object classes contained in the catalog .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "far - infrared ( far - ir ) and submm observations of the magellanic clouds were taken as part of the heritage key project @xcite using the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) and the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; @xcite ) on the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "photometric catalogs of point sources were created using starfinder @xcite which effectively removes diffuse emission to extract a point source flux . a full description of the heritage observations and data reduction details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the heritage survey detected over 35000 unique sources in the lmc and 7500 in the smc at 100 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath6 m .",
    "these sources were positionally cross - matched by @xcite to produce a heritage band - matched catalog ( bmc ) for the lmc and smc .",

    "legacy surveys of the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "further details regarding the band - matching are given in @xcite .",
    "the final heritage - bmc covers the 3.6 to 500 range and contains over 42000 unique sources ; these represent the dustiest populations of sources in the magellanic clouds .    in order to comprehensively classify the 500 sources in the heritage photometric catalogs , and",

    "the optical ubvi and near - ir jhk@xmath10 photometry comes from the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps ; @xcite ) ; the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) magellanic clouds point source survey @xcite , the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , and the 2mass 6x deep point source catalog ( 6x2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also obtained supplementary mid - ir data from the _ akari _ lmc point source catalog @xcite and the wise all - sky catalog @xcite .",
    "we considered sources from the various catalogs to be a match if the source is within 5@xmath11 of the irac 3.6 position in the bmc . in cases where there were multiple matches between catalogs we only considered the closest match .    to complement the photometric data we searched the spectroscopic data from the _ spitzer _ sage - spec survey of the magellanic clouds @xcite for all spectra taken with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; 5.2 - 38 @xmath12 m ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) and mips spectra ( mips - sed ; 52 - 97 @xmath12 m ) for matches to the heritage - bmcs .",
    "we found 185 matches .",
    "these sources have been spectroscopically classified by @xcite and woods et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "to identify the evolved stellar population in the magellanic clouds with a _",
    "herschel _ detection , we compiled a preliminary candidate list from sources which were identified as dusty objects in the late stages of stellar evolution including extreme and post - agb stars , planetary nebulae , and supernova remnants .",
    "these sources were categorized by @xcite by matching the heritage catalogs to other classification schemes and lists of previously identified objects in the literature .",
    "the heritage bmcs contain 443 lmc and 51 smc evolved star candidates and 45 lmc plus 9 smc pn candidates @xcite . in total 455 of these magellanic cloud sources have also been assigned an alternate classification , making it difficult to judge the reliability of the source classifications in the initial list of evolved stars .",
    "for this reason we have to employ additional selection criteria to remove young stellar objects and background galaxies from the evolved star candidate list .",
    "the following subsections describe our selection process , the methodology is generally listed in order of procedure however at some stages the selection criteria were assessed in parallel . for instance , an unambiguous identification can not be obtained solely upon the inspection of the source s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , thus the object s position and morphology was also considered simultaneously when assigning a likely classification .",
    "the most reliable point - source classifications are obtained from spectroscopic observations .",
    "this alleviates most of the ambiguity that arises from photometric classification schemes due to overlaps in colour - magnitude space and thus provides robust source classifications for ir objects .",
    "we compare our initial list of evolved star candidates to the sage - spec spectroscopic survey of the magellanic clouds @xcite . of the 529 unique sources in our list ,",
    "172 were found to have a spectroscopic counterpart .    from irs",
    "spectroscopy we find a total of seven evolved stars and four planetary nebulae .",
    "other less - common objects were also identified ; these include one blue supergiant ( bsg ) , one b[e ] star , one luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , one wolf - rayet ( wr ) star , one symbiotic star and two sources of an unknown physical nature ( @xcite , woods et al . in prep . ) .",
    "eight of these sources also have far - ir mips spectra covering the 5297  wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the remaining 154 objects with an irs counterpart were confirmed spectroscopically as ysos or hii regions @xcite .",
    "we remove these sources from the list of the evolved star candidates .",
    "the results of the spectral comparisons are summarised in tables  [ tab : lmc_fsample ] and [ tab : smc_fsample ] .    from the irs spectra",
    "we have identified 18 post main sequence stars .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation is still needed for the majority ( @xmath13 ) of the bmc evolved star candidates . for these 357 sources ,",
    "we use several other complementary metrics in parallel to find evolved objects , improve upon the source identification and to exclude non - evolved contaminants from our sample .",
    "photometrically it can be difficult to separate agb stars from ysos and young pne from compact hii regions .",
    "the colour selection criteria for the far - ir sources from @xcite and the candidate post - agb stars from @xcite heavily overlap with the same regions as the yso candidates in the colour magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) . as such many of these sources have multiple classifications in the literature and we expect a high degree of contamination from ysos in our initial evolved star sample selection .    to refine our selection further , the nature of each object with a far - ir detection was assessed by examining its sed from near - ir to far - ir wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ fig : egseds ] shows some illustrative examples of typical seds for the different classes of objects .",
    "based on the shape of the sed with the flux plotted in log(@xmath7f@xmath14 ) against log(@xmath7 ) and more specifically on the peak of the energy distribution we can ( tentatively ) divide the sources in our list into four separate classes : ( 1 ) evolved star candidate , ( 2 ) probable yso , ( 3 ) possible background galaxy , ( 4 ) a mismatch between the near- and far - ir data used in this study .",
    "the most extreme agb stars can have red colours similar to ysos , background galaxies , and pne , and will also display a rising sed between 8 to 24 @xmath6 m . we identify dust enshrouded agb stars based on the peak of the sed ; dusty agb stars typically peak in the irac bands ( @xmath98 @xmath6 m ) , while stars with little to no circumstellar dust peak in the near - ir .",
    "as the agb star becomes more obscured the peak of the sed shifts to longer wavelengths , and the sed may peak between 8 and 24 for the most extreme agb stars .",
    "agb stars detected with _",
    "herschel _ will fall in the latter category due to the cool dust envelopes which are likely providing additional extinction at the shorter wavelengths . in all cases",
    "the shape of the sed for agb stars resembles that of a blackbody with temperature between 100 and 3000 k.    red supergiants are more massive and are in general more luminous than agb stars .",
    "as they exhibit a similar dust chemistry to oxygen - rich agb stars , their seds are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "ancillary information such as luminosity , pulsation period or membership of a young cluster is generally required to separate these classes ( see section  [ sec : lum ] ) .",
    "post - agb stars tend to have a double - peaked sed , with one peak in the optical / near - ir ( due to a hot central stellar component ) and one in the mid - ir ( due to a detached shell of circumstellar emission ) .",
    "this double - peaked morphology enables one to readily distinguish post - agb stars from seds with a stellar component which has a large infrared excess .",
    "the seds of other more massive evolved stars such as lbvs , wr stars and bsgs tend to be double - peaked , showing a stellar photosphere and a strong far - infrared excess .",
    "the classifications for these sources are taken from the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are not solely based on the sed .",
    "the seds of stage 0/i ysos ( early to mid - stage ysos ) show a monotonic increase from the mid - ir to the far - ir , with the peak at @xmath5100 @xmath6 m . objects which peak in the far - ir are heavily obscured by cold dust , which absorbs the photospheric emission from the forming star , and re - radiates this energy at far - ir wavelengths .",
    "as the yso evolves it dissipates its surroundings and emission from warm dust begins to dominate the sed . for stars in the latest stages of formation , the peak emission is blue - ward of the far - ir , and these objects can be difficult to disentangle from other sources with a warm circumstellar dust continuum @xcite . given the high likelihood of contamination from ysos in our sample , additional care needs to be taken when inspecting the shape and peak of the energy distribution for these objects .",
    "however , objects which have an sed peak between 70 and 150 @xmath6 m are likely ysos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to break the degeneracy between ysos in the more advanced stage of formation and evolved stars which exhibit a significant ir excess , we created a mean yso sed for each evolutionary stage based on the 154 ysos with a spectroscopic counterpart ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for each yso spectral class ) .",
    "these ysos range from stage 0/14 and cover a wide range in luminosity . using the yso sed templates as a basis , we only retained those objects which peaked at wavelengths @xmath9 70or had a significantly different profile to that of a yso",
    ". we find 197 evolved star candidates closely mimic the seds of the previously identified ysos . after their removal",
    ", our sample contains 178 dusty evolved star candidates .",
    "the seds of pne have a very similar appearance to those of ysos , both in terms of shape and in the position of the peak ; rising from the mid - ir and peaking in the far - ir .",
    "background galaxies also tend to have a rising sed in the mid - ir , and the peak of their seds tends to lie in the _ herschel _ bands .",
    "we can not resort to seds to distinguish between these classes .",
    "we further consider potential confusion with background galaxies in section  [ image : gal ] .      at low flux levels where a source is only detected in a few _ herschel _ bands",
    ", the shape of the sed can be difficult to characterize .",
    "this can also be problematic in crowded fields , such as star - forming regions where there is a high probability of misidentification between photometric catalogs , due to the wide range in resolution between the surveys .",
    "we examine the seds for any large discontinuities between the photometry from different instruments and point source catalogs , indicative of a likely mismatch .",
    "an example of a mismatch between the photometric catalogs is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : egseds_pagb ] .",
    "the seds for these sources are most likely a combination of a point source with warm circumstellar dust and spatially coincident starless dust clump which radiated in the far - ir .",
    "we eliminate 109 bmc evolved star candidates from the sample due to a discontinuity in the sed .",
    "low flux levels may also be problematic when comparing sources in the heritage - bmc to objects previously identified in the literature , as this leads to higher positional uncertainties .",
    "this positional uncertainty in turn results in the potential misclassification of the bmc source as an evolved star .",
    "it is therefore vital that any source identified in the heritage - bmc as an evolved star has a smooth sed with data points that appear consistent with each other and are associated with a point source .",
    "figures  [ fig : lmcsed_eg ] and [ fig : smcsed ] show the seds ( as well as the available spectral data ) for the final candidate list of post main - sequence objects in the mcs . in all instances a smooth transition is seen between the 2mass , _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ photometry , thus the shapes of the seds in the ir are well defined . at shorter wavelengths",
    "it is sometimes unclear if the mcps data is associated with the source due to the difference in resolution , the high circumstellar extinction at optical wavelengths and intrinsic variability of the source .",
    "the seds show a range of distinguishing features due to the presence of warm and cold dust , which is dependent on the mass - loss history of the source . in all instances",
    "the seds are consistent with post main - sequence stars ; the final classification is noted in each panel .        .",

    "simutanious inspection of the images and the seds ensures that the bmc sources are real and not a composite of several nearby sources which contribute to the emission at different wavelengths , resulting from a mismatch between the _ herschel _ and _ spitzer _ catalogs .",
    "the pacs images are known to suffer from low level artifacts ( in the form of striping and cross - hatching ) @xcite which may affect the quality and reliability of point sources extracted from the original images at 100 and 160  @xmath6 m .",
    "thus care needs to be taken when studying compact objects detected in the pacs bands .    in an effort to obtain high - quality pacs images at 100 and 160  @xmath6 m",
    ", the heritage pacs data have been reprocessed with the tamasis software ( chanal and panuzzo , private communication ) which mitigates thermal drifts in the pacs imaging using the redundancy and high pass filtering of the observations , effectively removing the artificial structures that compromised the original images .",
    "however , the tamasis images can not be used to extract photometry because the mapping technique and filtering makes the photometry potentially systematically inaccurate .",
    "thus , we must inspect the refined pacs tamasis images to distinguish between striping and point - sources in the heritage bmc .",
    "we remove three spurious sources that are only detected with pacs and are coincident with the striped / hashed regions in the original images .      to determine the likelihood that a given source is an evolved star we conduct a careful visual inspection of the irac , mips , pacs and spire images .",
    "magellanic cloud emission line survey ( mcels ; @xcite ) h@xmath15 images were also examined .",
    "using ds9 @xcite we simultaneously view each evolved star candidate across multiple wavelengths , facilitating the inspection of the local stellar and interstellar environment .",
    "ysos and dust clumps tend to be concentrated along bright ism filaments @xcite ; conversely , we expect there to be very few agb stars associated with interstellar gas or dust structures .",
    "evolved stars are generally isolated and inhabit regions of low column density .",
    "inspection of the images indicates that many of the heritage - bmc evolved star candidates are embedded within bright knots of emission , located along large - scale dusty ism structures , or are concentrated around molecular clouds ; suggesting that these evolved star candidates are instead likely to be ysos or massive stars .",
    "we remove sources located within sites of massive star formation from our list if their sed also resembles that of a yso",
    ".    visual inspection of the _ spitzer _ images reveal a cluster - like morphology at the location of several of our evolved star candidates .",
    "this morphology is typical of small proto clusters , which appear as a single massive object in _",
    "the spatial resolution of the heritage images is @xmath16 pc at the distance of the magellanic clouds , and blending of clustered sources is prevalent .",
    "the bmc contains a groupid which specifies group membership and is assigned to sources that have multiple matches in the bmc . as the majority of the sources in the catalog are not sorted into groups we use this criterion as an additional indication of evolutionary status and",
    "ensure that only isolated sources are retained .",
    "some nearby galaxies are resolved with _",
    "irac and can be identified from their morphology ; for one source in particular ( hsobmhericc j85.622736 - 71.433709 ) we see a clear spiral pattern in the image .",
    "other galaxies ( e.g.  hsobmhericc j82.644586 - 68.104609 ) appear elongated and have an edge - on disc morphology , we remove fifteen spatially resolved galaxies from the sample .    as a secondary diagnostic for background galaxies ,",
    "@xcite identified distant galaxies in the bmc via their shape in the spire images .",
    "distant galaxies will be isolated from interstellar gas and dust structures , and appear unresolved and thus point - like at the _ herschel _ wavelengths .",
    "whereas , other heritage source s , such as ysos and dust clumps will appear slightly extended at spire wavelengths .",
    "for each source in the bmc , @xcite compares the sources 250 full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) to that of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "if the values are consistent to within 10% , the source is defined to be point - like .",
    "twenty eight sources in our sample fulfill this criterion , although not all of them are necessarily background galaxies . evolved stars without a detached shell will also appear point - like , thus we regard the shape in the far - ir as a rather weak constraint for separating background galaxies from agb stars in the magellanic clouds , and do not remove any object on this basis .      to further refine our evolved star candidate list ,",
    "we calculate the bolometric luminosity of the sources via a trapezoidal integration of the sed , from the optical to the far - ir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all sources within each magellanic cloud are considered to be at approximately the same distance and we use a distance modulus of 18.5 to the lmc and 18.9 to the smc @xcite . where possible , we also compute luminosities using the irsf photometry rather than the 2mass data and fold in the photometry from the wise and akari surveys .        figure  [ fig : mbol ] shows the absolute bolometric magnitudes distribution of the evolved star candidates in the lmc and smc .",
    "the luminosites for the majority of the objects in our sample are consistent with evolved stars .",

    "in general these limits are not an absolute division between the rgb , agb and rsg classes , instead they provide useful guidance on the likely class .      to aid in the final classification , we performed a simbad search on all of the sources to retrieve any other information pertinent to the classification .",
    "we found that twelve of our sources are relatively unknown in the literature , 26 are identified as evolved stars or pne with a high degree of confidence and 5 were classified as a yso ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we removed known early type stars from our list if they were identified by means other than colour - magnitude cuts .",
    "finally we fit the evolved star candidates using the @xcite grid of yso models , and visually examine the sed and model fits .",
    "we define well - fitted models as those whose @xmath19 per data point is less than ten .",
    "the yso - fitter has been shown to be a good method of separating evolved stars from yso candidates , since the yso models do not span the high luminosities and relatively cool photospheres typical of evolved stars @xcite .",
    "for other populations such as pne the yso fitter is less effective as a discriminant , as ysos and pne have similar seds and colours . for these sources",
    "a good fit does not inevitably imply that the source is a yso .",

    "notably , the heritage spire observations are more sensitive than the pacs observations , thus faint sources near the sensitivity limit are detected only at 250 and 350 @xmath6 m .",
    "this will adversely affect the detection of evolved stars which are expected to be brighter in the pacs bands compared to spire .    in the heritage images complex structures of knots and filaments due to ism dust dominate the background emission ; this prevents the detection of faint sources in regions of high background . while agb stars are unlikely",
    "to be directly associated with dust clumps or filaments , many may lie along the same line of sight .",
    "this is even more problematic for massive stars which are preferentially found in higher ism column densities .",
    "high background ( @xmath80 mjy sr@xmath66 ) regions cover 16% of the lmc and 2% of the smc ; in these regions the bmc is complete for sources brighter than 200 mjy @xcite .",
    "this is a factor of two greater than the completeness limits in low surface brightness regions .",
    "if our sample is distributed evenly across the magellanic clouds , then bright extended emission in the magellanic clouds may mask around five bona fide evolved stars with far - ir emission greater than 100 mjy . if we also take into account sources in the bmc which may potentially be evolved but were not included in our final list ( as they are more likely to be ysos ) then this estimate increases to approximately 10 sources .",
    "the magellanic clouds should therefore host between 18 and 23 post - main sequence stars with far - ir fluxes greater than the bmc completeness limit , rather than the 13 we currently detect .",
    "the remaining 22 sources in our sample are faint and fall below this limit ; here we do not have enough statistical information to provide a quantitative value for the total population of faint evolved stars with similar fluxes .",
    "the identification of evolved stars in the bmc is biased towards brighter sources ; these are prominent above the background and have an sed which is well sampled . to be included in our final list of probable evolved stars , each object",
    "must also be detected as a point - source in the mid - ir and be previously identified as an evolved star candidate in the literature or via photometric colour cuts . as such we do not discover any new objects in our vetted sample .",
    "faint sources which are variable and optically bright ( e.g. ogle variable stars ) , but have a low mid - ir flux will be excluded from our list as they are difficult to characterize . to complicate matters further , faint sources have larger positional uncertainties in the far - ir and hence have a higher possibility of a photometric mismatch .    in figures  [ fig : fircmd ] and [ fig : fircmd_2 ]",
    "we compare our final sample of evolved stars to the entire heritage bmc , the bmc candidate evolved stars which were identified as mismatch or probable ysos and the bmc evolved star candidates confirmed spectroscopically as ysos . as noted earlier , the spectroscopically confirmed sources are limited to the brightest stars in our sample due to signal - to - noise ratio constraints . in the spire @xmath81 and @xmath78 cmd",
    "there is a considerable amount of overlap between the different populations , and the sources are primarily separated based on their brightness at 250 @xmath6 m . here",
    "we see a clear distinction between the bright spectroscopically confirmed ysos and the evolved stars at log(@xmath81)@xmath52.7 , a similar cut is seen for the smc despite its lower dust content which suggests a robust upper limit to the 250-micron flux of evolved stars .    the majority of the sources that we conclusively identify fall well above the completeness limit of the _ herschel _ bmc .",
    "although we detect a moderate number of faint evolved sources below this line we have invariably missed others ; it is difficult to put a number on how may more of these faint sources might be evolved .",
    "the small spread in the @xmath81/@xmath78 colour and the limited number of evolved stars detected in both bands prohibits the classification of sources using only their far - ir flux .",
    "if we are to clearly identify evolved sources additional mid - infrared data is required .",
    "figure  [ fig : fircmd_2 ] shows a cmd which combines mid- and far - ir photometry ; here the various classes of objects tend to occupy different regions of cmd space although we are not able to completely separate the two populations .",
    "furthermore , by combining far - ir data with 8 photometry we effectively eliminate dust clumps and faint background galaxies from the cmd making it easier to distinguish the evolved sources .",
    "in this paper , we present a catalog of thirty five evolved stars and stellar end products which have been detected with pacs and spire as part of the _ herschel _ heritage survey of the magellanic clouds . our source identification method is based on mid - ir spectral confirmation , the sed characteristics , careful examination of the multiwavelength images and includes constraints on the luminosity and comparisons with yso models .",
