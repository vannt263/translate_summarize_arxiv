    "quantum dots ( qds ) containing discrete energy levels which can be tuned easily in experiment have been attracting considerable attention continuously , and the study of quantum transport properties through qds has become an interesting field which serves as a testing ground for the physical phenomena , such as kondo @xcite and fano effects@xcite .",
    "recent developments on the study include coulomb on - site repulsion @xcite , spin - flip effect caused by the magnetic leads @xcite or rotating magnetic field @xcite , and phonon - assisted tunneling in the molecular qd @xcitewith time - dependent field or ac gate voltage @xcite .",
    "electron transports coherently through an open qd can be investigated in the standard procedure by means of nonequilibrium green function ( ngf ) @xcite , the rate equation @xcite and some other methods@xcite .",
    "the current characteristic properties change dramatically if the qd is connected to additional devices , so various kinds of hybrid qd systems have been studied in the literature .",
    "two aspects mainly involved in those hybrid systems are the ferromagnetic and superconductor properties which evoke the spin degree of freedom of electrons .",
    "the f - qd - f system , i.e. , qd coupled with two ferromagnetic leads , has been studied as spin - valve device @xcite . in the superconductor case , the andreev reflection , conserving the momentum of the reflected particle but not the charge , plays a dominant role at the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor . using multichannel s - matrix method , beenakker demonstrated the resonant andreev tunneling in the normal metal - normal qd - superconductor ( n - nqd - s ) hybrid system in the zero - bias limit @xcite ; later claughton et al .",
    "extended this theory to the finite - bias case @xcite .",
    "sun et al . explored the resonant andreev reflection in this system with multienergy levels in normal qd and found that some extra peaks originating from the andreev reflection superimposed on the conventional current plateaus @xcite . and they also investigated the photon - assisted andreev and normal tunnels in this system . with an applied time - varying external field , it was observed that a series of photon - assisted andreev tunneling peaks appeared in the curve of the average current @xmath3 vs the gate voltage with the negative peaks on the left - hand side and positive peaks on the right - hand side of the original resonant peak in the absence of the external field @xcite .",
    "another interesting hybrid system consists of ferromagnet and superconductor leads coupled with a normal qd ( f - qd - s ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , zhu et al . provided an efficient method for introducing a spin degree of freedom in this system , and also derived the general current formula of the andreev reflection in a quantum dot connected with two ferromagnetic and one superconductor leads ( f@xmath4 , f@xmath5-qd - s ) @xcite .",
    "considering both the coulomb interaction and the multienergy levels in qd , feng and xiong studied the transport properties in the f - qd - s system 19 .",
    "very recently , cao et al . considered the spin - flip effect in qd of a f - qd - s system and found that the single - resonance peak of the andreev reflection conductance versus the gate voltage would spill into a double - resonance peak with the increasing of the spin - flip scattering strength @xcite . thus far , most of studies relating to andreev reflection have been focused on a single - qd system .    on the other hand ,",
    "the electron transport through a double - quantum - dot ( dqd ) , especially the parallel - coupled double - quantum - dot ( pdqd ) , is an interesting subject which may involve the quantum phase interference .",
    "an open pdqd threaded by a magnetic flux is regarded as an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometer in which the coherence of the electron remains partly even in the presence of coulomb repulsion@xcite .",
    "tunable coupling strength between two parallel dots makes the transport properties more complex and interesting@xcite .",
    "the tunable andreev reflection in an ab interferometer has been investigated recently by peng et al.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall study the electron transport through a n - pdqd - s structure , i.e. , a parallel - coupled double - quantum dot that is connected with two leads , one is a normal metal and the other is a superconductor . the device threaded by two magnetic fluxes ( see fig.1 ) with the interdot coupling can be regarded as a double ab interferometer . by using the ngf method , the current @xmath6 and the probability of the andreev reflection are derived .",

    "ii , we present the model hamiltonian and derive the general formula of the current and the probability of the andreev reflection with ngf method . in sec .",
    "iii , the properties of the current due to andreev reflection depending on bias voltage , magnetic flux , gate voltage , and interdot coupling strength are studied in detail , and several dufferent effects are predicted .",

    "the linewidth of dressed states , @xmath113 , increases with the increasing of @xmath108 , while @xmath114 decreases under the parameters considered here , and hence , the right peak gets wider and left peak becomes narrower with the increasing of @xmath108 .",
    "the linewidths @xmath140 are directly connected with the coupling strengths between qd and the leads .",
