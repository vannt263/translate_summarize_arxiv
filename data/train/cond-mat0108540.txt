    "the @xmath0-state potts model has various interesting properties to study @xcite .",
    "the order of the phase transition of the potts model depends on the spatial dimensionality and the number of states , @xmath0 .",
    "the phase transitions of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) potts models are more complex than those of the ferromagnetic potts models . here , we focus on the three - dimensional ( 3d ) af @xmath0-state potts models .",
    "@xcite studied the af 3- and 4-state potts models by use of the monte carlo simulation .",
    "ono @xcite pointed out an appropriate choice of the vector order parameter for the af potts models on a bipartite lattice .",
    "the phase transition of the af 3-state potts model is considered to belong to the @xmath2 universality class @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature phase of the af 3-state potts model was shown to be the broken - sublattice - symmetry ( bss ) state , but it is still an open question whether there exists the rotationally symmetric state or not below the 2nd order phase transition point of the @xmath2 universality class @xcite .",
    "compared to the af 3-state potts model , there have been not so many systematic studies on the af 4-state and higher - state potts models in three dimensions .",
    "recently , the af 4-state potts model was studied by itakura @xcite ; there is a finite - temperature phase transition , and the critical phenomena may belong to the heisenberg universality class if the phase transition is of 2nd order .",
    "however , a possibility of the 1st order transition was also argued @xcite .",
    "another source of interest in af @xmath0-state potts models is that it has the nonzero ground - state entropy without frustration .",
    "nonzero ground - state entropy , @xmath3 , is an important subject in statistical mechanics .",
    "one physical example is provided by ice .",
    "the af potts model is served as a useful model for the study of the nonzero ground - state entropy , and the nonzero ground - state entropy of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) af potts model was extensively studied by shrock and tsai @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo simulation is regarded as a standard tool for studying statistical mechanical properties @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo study using a conventional metropolis algorithm sometimes suffers from the problem of slow dynamics , or the long time scale problem . in the study of the phase transition ,",
    "the long time scale due to the critical slowing down causes the problem of slow equilibration . for the simulational study of the af potts models ,",
    "the cluster algorithm @xcite has been used @xcite to overcome the critical slowing down . as an extension of the cluster algorithm , tomita and",
    "okabe @xcite recently proposed a new cluster algorithm of tuning the critical point automatically , and applied it to the study of 2d potts models .",
    "the extended ensemble method is another type of attempts to overcome the slow dynamics .",
    "the multicanonical method @xcite , the simulated tempering @xcite , the exchange monte carlo method @xcite ( or the multiple markov chain method @xcite ) , the broad histogram method @xcite , and the flat histogram method @xcite are examples of the extended ensemble method . quite recently , wang and landau @xcite proposed an efficient algorithm to calculate the density of states with high accuracy . in the present paper we use the wang - landau algorithm @xcite to study the 3d af potts models .",
    "we study not only the phase transition of the af potts models but also the ground - state properties .",
    "the wang - landau algorithm is quite effective for this purpose because we can calculate the density of states with high accuracy .",
    "we make a random walk in the whole energy space , and the algorithm is appropriate for calculating the ground - state entropy .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the model and the vector order parameter for the af potts model .",
    "we also briefly explain the simulation method , the wang - landau algorithm . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the phase transition of the af 3- , 4- , 5- and 6-state potts models on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the ground - state properties of the 3- , 4- , 5- and 6-state potts models are studied in sec .",
    "the summary and discussions are given in sec .",
    "we deal with the af potts model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where the potts variable @xmath5 takes the value @xmath6 , and the summation is taken over the nearest - neighbor pairs of sites on a simple cubic lattice .    the ferromagnetic 3-state potts model can be transformed into the @xmath7 clock model , and the order parameter is well represented by a two - dimensional vector . for the af potts model on a bipartite lattice ,",
    "the sublattice structure should be taken into account @xcite ; that is , the staggered magnetization will be treated . using three components of the staggered magnetization @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote two sublattices , we define the vector order parameter as follows : @xmath11 here",
    ", @xmath12 denotes the unit vectors in two dimensions directing 120 degrees apart from each other , and @xmath13 then , the square of the vector order parameter simply becomes @xmath14 we can extend the above argument to higher - state potts models @xcite .",
    "in general the order parameter of @xmath0-state potts model is well described by the @xmath15 dimensional vector order parameter .",
    "we consider the unit vectors in @xmath15 dimensions pointing to @xmath0 directions as in the case of the 3-state potts model ; the sum of the unit vectors is set to be zero as in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) . using each component of the staggered magnetization , eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) , we can obtain the generalized expression for eq .",
    "( [ vec_order_2 ] ) , @xmath16 we should note that for the 3-state potts model the vector order parameter space spans a hexagonal region in a two - dimensional space , and the maximum value of @xmath17 is @xmath18 . for the 4-state potts model the order parameter takes the values within the area shown in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the maximum value of @xmath17 is @xmath19 .",
    "we briefly describe the wang - landau algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is similar to lee s version of the multicanonical method ( entropic sampling ) @xcite , the broad histogram method @xcite , and the flat histogram method @xcite ; but the wang - landau algorithm has advantage that it can estimate the density of states efficiently even for large systems .",
    "the idea of the wang - landau algorithm @xcite is that we make a random walk in energy space based on the transition probability from energy level @xmath20 to @xmath21 ; @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the density of states .",
    "since the exact form of @xmath23 is not known _ a priori _ , we determine @xmath23 iteratively ; @xmath23 is modified by @xmath24 every time the state is visited .",
    "the modification factor @xmath25 is gradually reduced to 1 by checking the  flatness \" of the energy histogram ; the histogram for all possible @xmath26 is not less than some value of the average histogram , say , 80% .",
    "we simulate the af @xmath0-state potts model ( @xmath0=3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) on a simple cubic lattice by using the wang - landau algorithm @xcite .",
    "we impose the periodic boundary conditions and the linear sizes are @xmath27 = 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 and 16 . for the modification factor @xmath25 , we start with @xmath28 with @xmath29=1 or some positive integer , and @xmath30 ; the final value of @xmath25 is chosen as @xmath31 , which is the same as ref .  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the density of states @xmath23 , and measure the physical quantities of interest as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "then , the canonical average of the physical quantity @xmath32 at the inverse temperature @xmath33 is calculated thorough the standard relation @xmath34 in the actual calculation , the relative density of states , @xmath35 , is directly obtained . in terms of the entropy ( in units of @xmath36 ) ,",
    "@xmath37 , the entropy difference , @xmath38 , is directly measured .",
    "imposing the constraint @xmath39 we can determine the absolute value of @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath40 is the number of lattice sites , that is , the number of potts spins . for the af potts model on a simple cubic lattice , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the energy @xmath26 takes the value from 0 to @xmath41 in units of @xmath42 .",
    "the state with the highest energy @xmath43 is nothing but the ferromagnetic ground state , and the degeneracy of the ferromagnetic ground states is @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we may check the accuracy of the calculation by confirming @xmath44 .",
    "first , we study the phase transition of the af potts model with @xmath0=3 , 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "let us start with showing the data for @xmath1 in order to make a comparison with higher - state models , although the phase transition of the 3-state potts model has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath45 for @xmath0=3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the data for @xmath27=8 , 10 , 12 , 14 and 16 are plotted by the dot - dashed , dashed , short - dashed , dotted and solid lines , respectively .",
    "the temperature is represented in units of @xmath46 .",
    "all the measurements are done for 4 independent runs , and the average is taken over 4 samples .",

    "( [ binder ] ) becomes a usual one for the scalar order parameter ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "since the prefactors of the @xmath27 dependence in the finite - size scaling equations are canceled out , one may determine the critical temperature @xmath50 from the crossing point of the data of temperature dependence for different sizes as far as the corrections to finite - size scaling are negligible .",
    "we also plot the specific heat in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "the specific heat peak becomes sharper when the system size is larger . from figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , [ fig3](b ) and [ fig3](c ) , we find a clear phase transition at a finite temperature .",

    "the estimated values for the critical temperature and the critical exponents are @xmath50 = 1.222(4 ) , @xmath52= 1.52(4 ) and @xmath53=0.46(5 ) . here , the number in the parentheses denotes the uncertainty in the last digit .",
    "the estimated values are consistent with the previous studies @xcite , and the obtained exponents are close to those of the 3d @xmath2 model .",
    "we have given the estimate using the finite - size scaling analysis to check the consistency of the calculation .",
    "precisely speaking , due to small system sizes , our estimate of @xmath50 is a little bit lower than the accurate estimate @xcite , which results in a little bit smaller @xmath53 . to discuss more accurate estimates of @xmath50 and the critical exponents , calculations with larger system sizes are preferable .",
    "it is not easy to estimate the specific heat exponent @xmath54 from the specific heat data using the finite - size scaling analysis , if @xmath54 is negative @xcite .",
    "we may use the temperature derivative of the specific heat , which is singular at @xmath50 even if @xmath54 is negative .",
    "we plot the temperature derivative of the specific heat in fig .",
    "[ fig3_cd ] .",
    "since we directly calculate the density of states by using the wang - landau algorithm , it is easy to compute the temperature derivative of the specific heat from the moments of energy . using the finite - size scaling relation @xmath55 we estimate the exponent @xmath54 as -0.04(6 ) .",
    "although our estimate has a relatively large error bar due to the small system size , our result suggests that @xmath54 is negative .",

    "they are compatible with the previous study @xcite , and the obtained exponents are close to those of the 3d heisenberg model . precisely , our estimate of @xmath50 is a little bit lower than the accurate estimate @xcite ; the situation is the same as the case of @xmath1 .",

    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) , [ fig5](b ) and [ fig5](c ) , respectively .",
    "there is no anomaly in the specific heat .",
    "there is no crossing in the binder parameter at finite temperatures .",
    "the critical temperature is down to zero .",
    "however , the value of the binder parameter at @xmath56 is finite , and it may become constant for large enough @xmath27 ; it is not clear whether @xmath56 is critical or not . to determine this point ,",
    "more elaborate study with larger sizes are necessary .",
    "we show the order parameter , the binder parameter and the specific heat for the 6-state potts model in figs .  [ fig6](a ) , [ fig6](b ) and [ fig6](c ) , respectively . in this case , the maximum linear size is @xmath57 .",
    "there is no anomaly in the specific heat .",
    "the value of the binder parameter at @xmath56 is very small .",
    "this means that the distribution of the order parameter is gaussian ; in other words , the system is disordered .",
    "we may conclude that there is no order even at @xmath56 .",
    "in this section , we focus on the ground - state properties of the af potts models .",
    "first , we consider the ground - state entropy per spin , @xmath58 ; the entropy ( in units of @xmath36 ) is calculated through @xmath59    in fig .",
    "[ fig_ge ] , we show the size dependence of the ground - state entropy per spin for the @xmath0-state af potts model on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we plot @xmath58 as a function of @xmath60 , and find a linear @xmath60 dependence .",
    "using the least square method , for @xmath1 we have @xmath61 where the number in the parentheses denotes the uncertainty in the last digit .",
    "@xcite estimated the ground - state entropy per spin ( @xmath62 ) as 0.3673 from the data of @xmath27= 4 and 8 .",
    "our estimate , 0.3670 , is a little bit smaller than their estimate .",
    "the low - temperature phase of the af 3-state potts model is the bss state .",
    "the typical configuration of the bss state is that all the spins on the sublattice @xmath9 take one of the three states , and the spins on the sublattice @xmath10 take one of the other two states randomly .",
    "then , the lower bound for the ground - state entropy becomes @xmath63 .",
    "our estimate , eq .",

    "then , the lower bound for the ground - state entropy becomes @xmath66 .",
    "our estimate , eq .",
    "( [ entropy_4 ] ) , is again larger than the lower bound .    from the size dependence of the ground - state entropy for the af 5-state potts model , which is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ge ] , we have @xmath67 the main contribution to the low - temperature phase of the 5-state potts model is as follows : the spins on the sublattice @xmath9 take two of five states randomly , whereas those on the sublattice @xmath10 take the other three states .",

    "our estimate , eq .",
    "( [ entropy_6 ] ) , is again larger than the lower bound for the ground - state entropy ; @xmath71 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ground - state entropy has a similar @xmath60 dependence for all @xmath72 , although there occurs the finite - temperature phase transition for @xmath73 and the zero - temperature phase transition for @xmath74 .",
    "the size dependence of @xmath69 is similar to that for @xmath72 .",
    "but the slope of @xmath60 dependence for @xmath69 is smaller than that of others .",
    "it is not clear whether this small difference is related to the existence of the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "we find that the ground - state entropy is larger than the contribution from the typical configurations of the bss state . in order to look into the ground - state properties more carefully ,",
    "let us consider the proportion of visiting the typical bss ground states among all the ground states .",
    "as an example , we treat the case of @xmath1 .",
    "since this proportion becomes very small for larger sizes , we have checked it for a smaller system , that is , @xmath75 .",
    "the estimate of the ground state entropy per spin @xmath58 for @xmath75 is 0.376 .",
    "thus , the expected value for the proportion of the typical bss ground states among all the ground states is @xmath76 = 0.010 ( @xmath77=216 ) .",
    "actually , the typical bss ground states were visited 0.010 times as frequently as all the ground states , which is consistent with the theoretical expectation . in other words",
    ", we sample ground states uniformly .",
    "next we study the distribution of the ground states . as an example",

    ", we expect the @xmath85-function distribution for the sublattice @xmath9 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ; @xmath88 becomes the gaussian distribution around 1/4 and @xmath89 for the sublattice @xmath10 .",
    "our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gd ] are close to those of the typical bss states , but we can see a clear deviation from the typical bss states and the size dependence . in other words , there are many configurations other than the typical configurations of the bss state . similar behavior is also obtained for the ground states of higher - state potts models .",
    "the deviation from the typical bss states becomes larger for higher @xmath0 .",
    "to summarize , we have applied a newly proposed monte carlo algorithm , the wang - landau algorithm @xcite , to the study of the 3d af @xmath0-state potts models .",
    "we obtain the finite - temperature phase transition for @xmath0= 3 and 4 , whereas the transition temperature is down to zero for @xmath0=5 . for @xmath0=6",
    "there exists no order for all the temperatures .",
    "we also study the ground - state properties . from the analysis of the size - dependence of the ground - state entropy",
    ", we find that the ground - state entropy is larger than the contribution from the typical configurations of the bss state for @xmath1 .",
    "the same situations are found for @xmath0 = 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "we have confirmed again the efficiency of the wang - landau algorithm . for the study of only the critical phenomena near the critical point , other methods may have advantage .",
    "however , in order to make the systematic study for all the energy space , we can treat larger systems by using the wang - landau algorithm , especially for higher @xmath0-state potts models .    in the present paper we have studied the ground - state entropy for the 3d af potts models .",
    "we had better mention that the accurate estimate of the nonzero ground - state entropy is easily obtained for the 2d af potts models , of course ; the obtained data are consistent with the previous studies @xcite .",
