    "phenomena strikingly deviating from the conventional understanding can take place if the speed of photons is allowed to vary from the constant light velocity @xmath0 .",
    "coleman and glashow ( 1997 ) argued that the velocity @xmath3 of light in the vacuum in a frame moving relative to the rest frame of the universe can differ from the maximal attainable speed @xmath0 of a material body . if @xmath4 , the photon 4-momentum @xmath5 is time - like , allowing a sufficiently energetic photon to decay into an electron - positron pair .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath6 , a charged particle will lose energy via vacuum erenkov radiation because the particle speed approaching @xmath0 at high energies can exceed the light speed @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the distance that energetic @xmath1-rays or charged particles can travel through is shortened for either @xmath4 or @xmath7 .",
    "however , the violation of relativity may also have a possibility of increasing the travelling distance of high energy radiation rather than decreasing .",
    "the speed of photons can vary due to modifications of the vacuum ( latorre et al .",
    "different energies excite the vacuum differently , and with quantum gravity , amelino - camelia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) speculated that the energy - momentum relation for photons is modified to violate lorentz invariance and the anomalous effect increases as photon energy approaches the planck energy scale ( @xmath8 gev ) .",
    "amelino - camelia et al .",
    "( 1998 ) has proposed a test for the modified speed by measuring the arrival time structure of photons from objects at cosmological distances .",
    "the propagation speed is @xmath9 from the modified relation of energy @xmath10 and momentum @xmath11 , @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 gev , according to amelino - camelia et al .",
    "1998 . by assuming the existence of a preferred frame for lorenz transformation but preserving other kinds of invariance , coleman and glashow 1998",
    "gives a relation , which is similar to ( 1 ) and equivalent to @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the maximal attainable speed of particle species @xmath18 with mass @xmath19 .",
    "our study in what follows will be in an explicit form based on ( 1 ) , but the results are , to some extent , applicable also to the other case by putting @xmath20 in the place where the term @xmath21 appears .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation of the shortest wavelength so far detected is tev @xmath1-rays ( see for example , weekes et al .",
    "1997 ; ong 1998 ) , but even for these high energy photons , the effect of velocity variation remains as small as a fraction @xmath22 of the light velocity .",
    "however , a higher degree of anomalous effect is expected for the absorption process , in which @xmath1-rays are converted into an electron ",
    "positron pair when they collide with soft photons of the universal radiation field .",
    "photons of tev energies react with infrared photons , and pev @xmath1-rays with the 2.7k cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) . from the number density of the photons of the universal infrared and cmb , the collision mean free path is usually estimated as about 100 mpc and 10 kpc ( _ e.g. _ strong et al .",
    "1974 ; stecker et al . 1992 ) , respectively for tev and pev @xmath1-rays .",
    "the largest distance we can see with the high energy radiations is thus much shorter than those of x - rays and optical photons of longer wavelengths .",
    "the threshold energy is determined by a function of the total energy @xmath23 and momentum @xmath24 of the initial state , @xmath25 , which must exceed @xmath26 for the pair creation , where @xmath27 is the electron mass . in the initial state of a @xmath1-ray obeying the relation ( 1 ) and soft photons of energy @xmath28",
    ", the square of the energy @xmath10 and the momentum @xmath29 in @xmath25 almost cancel each other to leave @xmath30 ( the two photons are assumed to be from opposite directions ) .",
    "the remaining two terms are , when @xmath31 is as small as @xmath32 , of similar magnitude to each other , incurring a considerable degree of anomalous effect .",
    "in addition , the two terms become as large as @xmath33 when @xmath34 ev , and the threshold condition is considerably affected by the violation effect for @xmath35 ev , which can be much lower than the planck energy scale .",
    "let us examine the above speculation by calculating in our rest frame the conservation of momentum of the reaction . by putting @xmath0",
    "= 1 hereafter , the momentum @xmath36 of the initial state ( we assume for simplicity , but not to lose the generality , @xmath37head - on collision of @xmath1-ray and soft photon ) must be equal to @xmath38 of the final state , where ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) is energy and momentum of electron and positron and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the angles @xmath40 and @xmath42 make against the direction of the initial gamma ray and are in the order of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 and 2 ) . by using the approximation @xmath48 and the condition on the transverse momenta @xmath49",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 we use a parameter @xmath51 to replace @xmath39 and @xmath41 by @xmath52 with the condition @xmath53 . the equation ( 2 )",
    "is then written as @xmath54 the first and second terms are of the same order of magnitude , the latter term approaching zero at the threshold of the reaction",
    ". with increasing @xmath10 , softer photons can serve as the _ target _ photons , shortening the absorption mean free path .",
    "this conventional view is altered as @xmath10 further increases , by the presence of the term @xmath55 .",
    "however , electron and positron may also obey a modified relation similar to ( 1 ) .",
    "let us put , similarly to ( 1 ) , the square of the modified momentum @xmath56 to be equal to @xmath57 we grant @xmath58 for allowing electrons to have a different degree of the invariance violation . by replacing @xmath59 by @xmath56 , a relation similar to ( 3 ) ,",
    "@xmath60 is obtained . since energy @xmath10 is divided almost equally into two particles ( when @xmath61 ) and the anomalous term has @xmath62 dependence , the factor 2 appears in the denominator of @xmath63 , thus reducing the effect in the final state .",
    "the fact might seem to suggest that the single @xmath37leading particle taking almost all the total energy ( @xmath64 ) is capable of eliminating the anomalous effect .",
    "however , the substitution of @xmath65 into ( 5 ) increases the energy @xmath28 to @xmath66 mev which is much higher than @xmath67 , and then leads to a very large travelling distance , resulting in no less anomalous consequence .",
    "only if @xmath68 is tuned to be @xmath69 for unknown reason , we can recover the ordinary relation for @xmath28 .",
    "energy @xmath28 of the _ target _ photon is plotted against @xmath1-ray energy @xmath10 in fig .  1 .",
    "a minimum value of @xmath28 is taken , if @xmath70 , at the critical energy @xmath71 ev for @xmath72 .",
    "the minimum value is about 0.03 ev and @xmath28 must increase to about 30 ev at @xmath73 ev .",
    "thus , cmb of @xmath74 ev is never given a chance of contributing to the pair creation process .",
    "the travelling length has the shortest value of @xmath7510 mpc at @xmath76 , and increases again for @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78ev photons are very sparse , @xmath1-rays would travel through distances @xmath79 1 gpc .",
    "when @xmath80 , @xmath28 must rapidly decrease as @xmath10 approaches @xmath81 . before taking negative value ,",
    "cmb photons become available as _ target_. the energetic @xmath1-rays are then efficiently absorbed with a mean free path of @xmath82 kpc , which is shorter by orders of magnitude than the ordinary case .    among the tev @xmath1-ray sources are two active galaxies , mrk 421 and mrk 501 ( punch et al . 1992 ; aharoninan et al . 1997 ; catanese et al .",
    "the objects are at distances of @xmath75 100 mpc , and the detection is consistent with the absorption mean free path determined by infrared intensity in the extra - galactic space .",
    "the energy spectrum of the @xmath1-rays is found to extend up to 10 - 20 tev . if the spectrum continues to extend to even higher energies ,",
    "@xmath83 would be excluded . because , if @xmath83 , a very sharp cut - off at the common energy @xmath81 is expected in the energy spectrum for any extra - galactic objects .",
    "the negative @xmath28 for @xmath77 in the case of @xmath83 implies that @xmath1-rays does not need _ target _ photons for pair creation .",
    "the threshold of @xmath1-ray decaying into an electron - positron pair ( coleman and glashow 1997 ) is given by @xmath84 . by putting @xmath85 tev",
    ", we obtain a limit on @xmath86 to be @xmath87 ( by putting @xmath88 ev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath86 is positive and @xmath89 , the travelling distance turns over to increase above about 10 tev and to become larger than 1 gpc for the photons around 100 tev .",
    "thus , 100 tev photons would arrive from extra - galactic sources , implying that evidence of detection would be strongly in favour of the @xmath90 case .",
    "extra - galactic diffuse @xmath1-rays are most likely from distant unresolved active galaxies .",
    "the energy spectrum is observed by sreekumar et al .",
    "1997 to extend to about 50 gev with a hard power index of @xmath91 .",
    "the spectrum is expected to become steeper at higher energies due to the intenser infrared photons and then cmb at longer wavelengths . however , in the case of @xmath90 , the energy spectrum may have a _ turn - over _ of showing a harder slope above @xmath76 .",
    "electrons lose their energy quickly and have difficulty in producing such high energy @xmath1-rays .",
    "however , cosmic ray protons are known to have energy spectrum extending to @xmath92 ev , and are able to produce @xmath1-rays as high as or larger than 100 tev .",
    "the increase of travelling distance suggests more contribution from more distant sources and thus we may expect considerably intense , diffuse @xmath1-rays in the higher energy region . from the crab nebula ,",
    "50 tev photons have been detected ( tanimori et al . 1997 ) by using imaging erenkov telescope at large zenith angles .",
    "detection of 100 tev @xmath1-rays is not unrealistic by the extensive application of such methods .",
    "our phenomenological consideration can be extended to other processes of soft photons acting as the reaction target .",
    "extremely high energy cosmic ray protons ( _ e.g. _ hill and schramm 1985 ; axford 1994 ; ohalloran et al .",
    "1998 ; takeda et al .",
    "1998 ) are believed to lose energy by pion production in collision with cmb .",
    "the number density of cmb and the photo - pion cross section determine the collision mean free path to be @xmath82 mpc .",
    "the energy spectrum thus suffers from the gzk cutoff ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin and kuzmin 1966 ) at about @xmath92 ev , if the protons are from the distances farther than the mean free path .",
    "however , the relation ( 4 ) assumed for proton and pion alters the threshold of the energy @xmath28 of _ target _ photons from @xmath93 to @xmath94 the energy @xmath10 is for the initial proton , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the proton and pion mass , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 for protons and pions , respectively .",
    "we have put the parameter @xmath51 to be @xmath99 , corresponding to the case in which the ratio of proton to pion energy in the final state is @xmath100 near the threshold of the process . if @xmath101 is positive and not very far from the order of one , the second term becomes comparable with @xmath102 at the critical energy @xmath103 ev . at @xmath104",
    "ev , the energy @xmath28 needs to be , as dominated by @xmath105 , as large as @xmath106 ev , and cmb can not play the role of _ target _ photons .",
    "cosmic ray protons at @xmath107 ev can then travel without the attenuation from cosmological distances farther than @xmath82 mpc . as a result",
    ", the energy spectrum of cosmic rays would extend beyond @xmath92 ev , provided that the acceleration to such high energies takes place in celestial objects .",
    "there is speculation by vietri 1995 and waxman 1995 that grb ( @xmath1-ray bursts ) provides the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "if so , grbs at cosmological distances would produce a cosmic ray spectrum without gzk cutoff .",
    "if @xmath108 , @xmath28 can be @xmath74 ev when @xmath10 approaches @xmath109 ev , implying that the _ target _ photons of cmb gives a characteristic attenuation length of @xmath7510 mpc to @xmath110 ev cosmic rays . for @xmath111 , the kinematical condition does not require the _ target _ photon for the pion production to occur and the processes of @xmath112 and @xmath113 will cause protons to rapidly lose energy .",
    "the energy loss due to the spontaneous production of pion is in contradiction with the evidence of cosmic ray protons up to @xmath92 ev .",
    "thus , we limit @xmath114 longer than @xmath92 ev , and obtain a bound of @xmath115 .",
    "collision processes of high energy radiations with soft photons enable us to test the consequences of violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "in particular , the effect of quantum gravity which amelino - camelia et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest can be made detectable by the reaction process in the energy region much lower than the planck energy scale , but in the sufficiently high energy region to which the validity of lorentz transformation has not been examined yet by accelerator experiments .",
    "the violation suggests an interesting possibility of increasing the distance we can reach by observing high energy @xmath1-rays and cosmic rays .",
    "absence of the gzk cutoff would not necessarily mean nearby origin of the extremely high energy cosmic rays .",
    "photons of energies larger than 100 tev from extra - galactic objects would provide a clear test because it is hard to explain by other mechanisms than the violation of invariance .",
    "it seems impossible , once we admit the relation ( 1 ) for photons , to totally eliminate the anomalous effect , without a specially designed tuning among the invariance violating terms for various particles of different masses .",
    "other ways have been proposed to alter the conventional view on the relativity ( gonzares - mestres 1997 ; sato 1998 ) .",
    "absence of gzk cutoff can be explained , according to sato 1998 , without abandoning the lorenz invariance , but by giving a special status to @xmath116the universe frame  in which cmb is isotropic .",
    "protons are expected to lose energy via vacuum erenkov radiation ( coleman and glashow 1997 ) , when @xmath117 .",
    "the threshold energy , @xmath118 , of the radiation is calculated from equating the speed of photon to that of proton .",
    "the detection of the highest energy @xmath92 ev of cosmic rays sets a constraint @xmath119 ev and limits the @xmath86-parameters to be @xmath120 or rather @xmath121 for practical use .",
    "the erenkov radiation from electron yields a less tight constraint because of the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath122 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath123 .",
    "the highest energy @xmath124 ev of cosmic ray electrons ever detected ( nishiumura et al .",
    "1997 ) must be less than @xmath122 and then we obtain @xmath125 .",
    "if we choose , for the bound on @xmath122 , @xmath126 tev electrons which are responsible for tev @xmath1-rays and which are considered to extend over a spatial scale of at least @xmath75 1 pc , the constraint is made somewhat tighter as @xmath127 .",
    "we may argue about allowed region of @xmath128 values by combining the condition @xmath129 from the decay process @xmath130 .",
    "the region is , to some extent , in disfavor with negative values .",
    "the time structure of the outbursts of tev @xmath1-rays from mrk  421 and mrk  501 sets constraint on @xmath131 .",
    "the delay time of 10 tev @xmath1-rays relative to photons of lower energies is @xmath132 for distance @xmath133 mpc .",
    "duration of the outbursts which has been observed typically as a few hours is considered to be longer than the delay time , providing a constraint of @xmath134 .",
    "we need to know the outburst structure in time scales as short as @xmath135 to constrain @xmath136 less than @xmath89 . in order to restrict the @xmath136 parameter more tightly",
    ", it is very useful to observe photons of higher energies from more distant objects .",
    "however , we can not expect that such @xmath1-rays survive against conversion into an electron - positron pair and reach us , unless we premise that the lorenz invariance is violated .",
    "we may argue that the extensive air shower events of @xmath107 ev are in truth not due to proton .",
    "such a claim is relevant to @xmath37correct understanding of the complex phenomena of the cascade shower process , which still leaves a room for a speculation of @xmath37anomalous interaction of cosmic rays .",
    "thus , it is interesting to indicate that the modified relation of energy and momentum can affect detection of the high energy radiations .",
    "observation of @xmath1-rays for example is based on the pair creation process in the detector material ( satellite experiments ) or in the atmosphere ( ground - based observation for tev photons and cosmic rays ) .",
    "the recoil momentum @xmath137 of atomic nucleus in the material is calculated as twice the right hand side of the expression ( 5 ) .",
    "the ordinary recoil momentum is @xmath138 ev / c at @xmath139 ev , which corresponds to quite a small energy transfer to the recoiled atomic nucleus of a large mass . when @xmath140 and @xmath77 , @xmath137 must be larger than @xmath141 but remains reasonably small so that the process would not be largely affected .",
    "when @xmath142 and @xmath77 , @xmath137 appears negative , the recoil being in the opposite direction to the initial @xmath1-ray .",
    "there are generally several processes which compete the pair creation and for which the invariance violation is of different strengths .",
    "the consequence may appear as observation of an anomalous behaviour of very high energy radiations .",
