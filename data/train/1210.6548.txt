    "since the discovery of the high critical temperature superconductivity in the called cuprates  ( made up of copper oxides ) @xcite , the search about the nature of their behavior has been and it continues being , one of the most defiant and investigated topics in condensed matter physics . among these compounds is the @xmath3 , that is a classic example of the so - called strongly correlated electron systems ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , due to the inherent difficulties of the many body problem for this class of materials , numerous properties continue without being clearing up , in spite of the efforts done by the investigators in this subject .",
    "the @xmath3 superconductor is characterized by a drastic change in its behavior depending on the density of electrons in the two - dimensional planes @xmath15 @xcite , and it happens in general in the @xmath16 superconductivity materials .",
    "all the cuprate superconductors have as a common element , the existence in their crystal structure of @xmath15 planes .",
    "the standard band calculations predict a character of paramagnetic - conductor to this material @xcite , in drastic contrast with its experimentally observed , insulating and antiferromagnetic nature .",
    "these two properties are associated with the presence of strong correlations , and are not derivable starting from an independent particle scheme as the hartree - fock ( @xmath17 ) one , when the whole many electron crystal system is considered @xcite . however , in refs .",
    "@xcite , on the base of a single band model solved in the @xmath17 approximation , it was possible to predict the mentioned @xmath14 properties of this material . at first sight",
    ", it might seem that to obtain the @xmath4 and insulating properties of @xmath18 from a @xmath17 scheme , could be a contradictory outcome , since those properties are thought as essentially indicating the strong correlation nature of this material .",
    "however , those results become natural ones , when considering the following circumstances . in first place ,",
    "the @xmath17 procedure was not applied in its quality of a @xmath19 @xmath20 method to solve the full hamiltonian problem associated to the total electronic structure of @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively , the procedure was employed for solving the simple model of the @xmath21 layers built in refs .",
    "it is well - known that the impossibility of describing strong correlation properties by employing the @xmath17 scheme , appears when the scheme is applied to find the solution of the exact many electron problem defined by all the electrons and nuclei constituting a crystalline solid .",
    "for example , the direct @xmath17 calculation of the band structure of @xmath18 , predicts an enormous electronic gap of nearly of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the model introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , only considers the electrons that half - filled the single band crossing the fermi level appearing in the early electronic band calculation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the proposed simple hamiltonian can be viewed as a preliminary stage within the definition of one among the variety of hubbard s hamiltonians .",
    "one , in which the last step of imposing the nearest neighbor approximations leading to the hubbard theories had not been implemented .",
    "therefore , the proposed model could be considered as an improvement of a hubbard one , which retains the full coulomb repulsion operator intact @xcite .",
    "this last point can be understood by keeping in mind that its free hamiltonian is basically a @xmath0 one in which the full coulomb interaction operator between the electrons had been retained .",
    "thus , after performing the nearest neighbor approximations , a typical hubbard scheme arises .",
    "henceforth , since the hubbard model is recognized to convey strong correlation effects , and moreover , since it is also known that it s mean field solutions also can exhibit such effects @xcite , the appearance of the insulator gap and the antiferromagnetic structure in refs .",
    "@xcite , becomes a reasonable conclusion .",
    "however , a new physical prediction coming from the analysis is the existence of pseudogap states , which are not following in the hubbard approximation .",
    "these mentioned results emerged as a consequence of a combination of lattice symmetry breaking with a spin - space entanglement structure in the single particle solutions of the @xmath17 problem .",
    "the treatment gave a clear explanation about the nature of the antiferromagnetism and the insulating structure of this high temperature superconductor .",
    "the process through which the electronic structure evolves with the hole doping , from the @xmath6 state at low doping to the superconductor state , and then to a normal metal phase at large hole concentrations , has been the subject of a strong interest in the literature .",
    "it is known that the magnitude of the gap in the normal state is of the same order that the superconductor gap @xcite . with the objective of studying the hole doping dependence of the band structure ,",
    "the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) system is for several reasons appropriate among the family of the @xmath10 superconductors . in first place",
    ", the @xmath24 has a simple crystalline structure of @xmath15 layers .",
    "second , the concentration of holes in these planes can be controlled in a wide range and is uniquely determined by the concentration @xmath25 of @xmath26 @xcite . for this reason , one can develop samples of the material by varying doping continuously from the insulating state without doping @xmath27 up to the high doping limit @xmath28 in the same system .",
    "numerous experiments made in copper oxide compounds , suggest the existence of a quantum phase transition at @xmath7 , which lays inside the doping interval of the superconducting dome ( this is colloquially referred as laying beneath  the dome ) .",
    "it is believed that this @xmath8 is the key to understand the high temperature superconductivity and also to explain the properties of the normal state in those materials @xcite .",
    "the present work presents results that predict the existence of this sort of @xmath8 in the context of the model for the @xmath29 constructed in refs .",
    "@xcite when the hole doping is incorporated .",
    "the @xmath17 system of equations is solved here by employing the same method used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present case ,",
    "again the parameters of the model are determined of imposing the condition that the @xmath17 solution without crystalline symmetry breaking , reproduces the form of the single band crossing the fermi level in the band calculations of the material @xcite .",
    "then , we investigated the changes that occur in the band structure when the system is doped with holes .",
    "as in refs .",
    "@xcite at exact half - filling , the @xmath17 solution predicts the existence of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 states .",
    "this previous result motivated the idea of investigating the hole doping consequences , after conceiving the possibility of predicting the quantum phase transition at @xmath30 .",
    "the same existence of this transition , is currently one of the most fundamental questions in high temperature superconductivity research @xcite .",
    "a transition like this is now considered that should determine the properties of the normal state in the diverse regions of the phase diagram .",
    "the present investigation aim consists in studying the existence of this quantum phase transition beneath the superconducting dome .",
    "the hartree - fock description of the simple model for the @xmath1-@xmath2 planes of @xmath3 including symmetry breaking effects and spin - spatial entanglement  of the single particle states at half - filling , is here extended to consider the effects of hole doping .",
    "it is observed how the effect of doping is able to predict a variety of the most interesting properties of this material a @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution of the band spectrum of the antiferromagnetic - insulator and the paramagnetic - pseudogap states as functions of the hole doping parameter are determined , for a wide range of the hole concentration @xmath31 . around the critical doping @xmath32 ,",
    "the results show that for the @xmath6 state , the band spectrum suffers a gradual change , in which the insulator gap diminishes to completely closing .",
    "surprisingly , the same behavior occurs for the @xmath5 state for which the pseudogap also collapses . for higher values than the mentioned critical doping one ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath5 states coalesce in a single @xmath17 solution .",
    "the magnetization of this high doping state vanishes as well as its gap , thus , it describes a paramagnetic - metallic phase .",
    "the results also reveal a drastic change in the fermi surface , which goes from a hole - like fermi surface centered at ( @xmath33 ) for @xmath34 into an electron - like one centered at ( @xmath35 ) for @xmath36 .",
    "these results evidence the existence of a quantum phase transition laying beneath the superconductor dome , in which an insulator state with antiferromagnetic correlations transits to a paramagnetic - metallic phase .",
    "the work also identifies a new mechanism of hole pairing which could give rise to the superconductivity .",
    "the effect results from a combination of the kramers degeneration with the spin - spatial entanglement of the single particle @xmath17 states .",
    "the discussion helps to clarify the relation between : the pair of states @xmath6 and @xmath5 in the physics of the strongly correlated electron systems with the superconductor state and the quantum critical point , around which the phase transition occurs @xcite .",
    "an evaluation of the hole pairs binding energy as a function of the dielectric constant is obtained , which predicts binding of the pairs at the experimentally measured values of the dielectric constant of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , the thermodynamic limit for this calculation had not been attained yet in this work .",
    "in addition , the parameters of the model should be optimized yet to match the measured parameters of the material as the insulator gap of @xmath37 @xcite , and the dielectric constant having a value of the order of @xmath38 @xcite . here ,",
    "it is pointed out that this binding effect could be the acting mechanism determining the physical relevance of the doubly charged bosonic fields argued in ref .",

    "<S> the effect of hole doping on the tight - binding ( @xmath0 ) model of the @xmath1-@xmath2 planes in the @xmath3 constructed in previous works is investigated here . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it is pointed out that the model employed constitutes a generalization of the hubbard one for the same system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the former predictions of the insulator gap , antiferromagnetic ( @xmath4 ) character and the existence of a paramagnetic - pseudogap ( @xmath5 ) state at half - filling , become natural ones to be expected from this more general picture . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of hole doping on the antiferromagnetic - insulator state ( @xmath6 ) and the paramagnetic - pseudogap one at half - filling , is investigated here at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the results predict the occurrence of a quantum phase transition ( @xmath8 ) from the antiferromagnetic- insulator state at low doping to a paramagnetic - metallic state ( @xmath9 ) at higher hole densities . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a clear description of the hidden @xmath8 laying beneath the dome  in high critical temperature ( @xmath10 ) superconducting materials is found . at low doping , </S>",
    "<S> the systems prefers the @xmath6 state , and at the critical value of the doping density @xmath11 , the energy of a metallic state starts becoming lower . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution with small doping values of the band spectrum of the @xmath6 state , shows that the holes tend to become localized at the middle of the sides of the reduced brillouin zone ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , when @xmath13 passes through the critical value , the holes of the @xmath6 state move to become situated at the corners of the same reduced @xmath12 , showing in this way a structural change at the phase transition point . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath9 state which appears at the transition point acquires the same behavior with respect to the localization of holes as the pseudogap state . in the small doping limit </S>",
    "<S> a clear difference between the degree of convergence of the iterative self - consistent solution is associated to an even or odd number of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that the kramers degeneration in combination with the spin - spatial entangled nature of the hole states , leads to a new kind of pair interaction between two holes . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy value is estimated as a function of the screening . </S>"
