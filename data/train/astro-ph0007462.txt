    "one of the open questions in cosmology today is the state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in the present popular cosmological models , a putative cosmological constant accounts for perhaps 2/3 of the energy density of the universe , and a similarly mysterious cold dark matter component accounts for 2/3 of the remainder . of order 10% of the energy density",
    "is supposed to be accounted for by baryons @xcite as obtained from primordial nucleosynthesis calculation .",
    "surprisingly , the vast majority of the baryons in the local universe is as of yet undetected .",
    "the directly observed known components consisting of stars , as well as hot and cold gas in galaxies , groups and clusters , only account for a few percent of this baryon budget @xcite .",
    "cluster of galaxies are known to possess a large gas fraction , of order @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this gas fraction , if representative of the universe at large , is sufficient to account for the majority of baryons in the universe @xcite .",
    "since gravity acts on all particles equally , one expects this ratio within the virial radius of clusters to be representative of the universal fraction . in the standard bottom - up picture of structure formation , clusters are the most massive objects in the universe , and therefore the latest to form .",
    "this suggests that the majority of baryons is in a diffuse intergalactic form , which forms the intracluster medium when clusters collapse .",
    "if the baryons were in other forms , for example compact objects which formed early in the universe , it would be extremely difficult to understand how those baryons would be released back into diffuse form when clusters form .",
    "@xcite showed that the igm must have been heated by sources other than the gravitational energy of collapse and its resulting shock waves .",
    "its direct detection would be of significant interest to quantitatively understand the distribution and state of the igm , and thereby infer its thermal history .",
    "unfortunately , hot diffuse gas is difficult to detect in emission .",
    "luckily , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) scatters off all free electrons through inverse compton scattering , allowing us to `` see '' the igm through scattering , in analogy to absorption .",
    "this is known as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , which is becoming routinely observable .",
    "it becomes the dominant source of cmb fluctuations on arc - minute scales .",
    "several experiments to conduct deep blank field or all sky search are under development .",
    "the upcoming cmb experiments such as amiba ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , etc . and the current cbi ( @xcite ) are capable of detecting this angular scale . using multi - frequency information",
    ", the sz fluctuation can be disentangled from the primary anisotropies at all angular scales @xcite .",
    "on the theory part , various approaches have been explored to compute the sz angular power spectrum . amongst these ,",
    "the press - schechter formalism is perhaps the most widely used due to its versatility and ease of implementation @xcite .",
    "the authors above adopted the cluster gas model , while @xcite used simulations and @xcite used a simplified gas pressure bias model motivated from simulations to probe the statistics of the sz effect .",
    "one of the shortcomings of the sz effect is its lack of redshift information .",
    "since scattering is independent of redshift , the sz effect on one hand allows a direct probe of the igm to high redshift , on the other hand makes it challenging to disentangle the contributions arising from different redshifts . in this paper , we apply the hierarchical clustering model and non - linear perturbation theory to directly compute the sz effect .",
    "this analytical method enables us to to extract distance information of intergalactic gas from the cross correlation of the sz effect with galaxy surveys and at the same time , check the results of both simulations and the press - schechter formalism . in section [ sec : ps ] , we develop our gas pressure model and in section [ sec : stat ] the sz statistics including power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "section [ sec : cross ] contains our results on the sz - galaxy cross correlation and the method to extract the redshift distribution of the sz effect .",
    "the effect of non - gravitational heating and the method to extract it from overall gas pressure power spectrum are discussed in section [ sec : ngheating ] .",
    "we discuss the potential inaccuracies arising from the approximations in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the paper concludes with section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the temperature distortion caused by the sz effect @xcite is : @xmath2 \\equiv -2ys(x)\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the direction on the sky , @xmath4 , and the scattering function @xmath5 when @xmath6 ( rayleigh - jeans tail ) . in this limit",
    "the sz effect results in an apparent cooling of the cmb background .",

    "@xmath20 is the present cosmological matter density .",
    "@xcite showed that the intergalactic medium has most likely been preheated by non - gravitational sources to @xmath21 kev per nucleon in order to be consistent with the observed upper bounds from the x - ray background .",
    "we adopt the model of @xcite to express the gas distribution as a convolution of the matter distribution : @xmath22 this equation expresses gas as being less clumped than dark matter , partly due to the required preheating .",
    "the effective radius in the top - hat window function , which is the gas heating radius , has the typical value @xmath23 mpc from the x - ray background constraint @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the gaussian window @xmath24 ( @xmath25mpc corresponds to @xmath26 mpc top hat window ) .",
    "the window function for specific heating models can be obtained from hydrodynamic simulation by comparing the gas power spectrum to the dark matter power spectrum ( ma and pen , 2000 ) .",
    "we also need to relate the gas temperature with the density .",
    "first , we consider the gravitational heating . we adopt the cosmic energy theorem @xcite for the gas temperature model , which specifies the ratio between gravitational binding energy and total kinetic energy @xmath27 .",
    "the pressure depends on the thermalized fraction of @xmath27 .",
    "the translational kinetic energy is thermalized from the energy released when particles shell cross . a model of the thermalized energy",
    "is thus given by the difference in energy between two particles separated by a non - linear scale in lagrangian space , which is the distance at which they can be expected to have shell crossed . the exact procedure amounts to solving the non - linear evolution equations directly .",
    "but we can treat the effect statistically in a linear fashion . in the initial linear evolution ,",
    "the gravitational potential remains constant .",
    "after virialization , the gravitational energy at a fixed location remains almost constant . in an eulerian description , we can describe the energy of particles at a final virialized location as the energy released as a particle travels from its initial position to the final virialized location . while the initial position is not exactly known , we take a spherical average over the non - linear scale to average over all possible initial locations .",
    "we thus have @xmath28 @xmath29 is the gravitational potential , @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 ( hereafter call the `` electron window function '' ) is the potential averaged over the non - linear scale @xmath32 .",
    "we choose a gaussian window function @xmath33 with the the non - linear scale @xmath32 , which for @xmath34 is @xmath35mpc .",
    "hereafter we will adopt this value of @xmath32 .",

    "the spatial average of the temperature , for example , is exactly zero , and for our model using gaussian random fields , it will be negative in half the volume .",
    "but for purposes of modeling the sz effect , temperature is only observable when multiplied by density , and regions of positive temperature will have high density , while the negative temperature regions only contribute negligibly to the sz effect .",
    "this model is not meant to be an exact description , but hopefully captures the statistical properties , while being simple and thus exactly solvable .    in order to estimate the accuracy of these assumptions ,",
    "we first compute the gas density weighted temperature and the mean @xmath7 parameter .",

    "the shape of the correlation function depends directly on the assumed structure of halos , which is a free function of the model and empirically measured in simulations . the radially averaged structure of halos , however , is not necessarily a direct predictor of correlations , unless one assumes halos to have no substructure .",
    "it is reassuring to see that our approach , which originates from the diametrically opposite theoretical bases from press - schechter formalism , produces consistent results and agrees with simulations .",
    "since we are interested in small angular scale where the line - of - sight cmb survey depth is much larger than any correlation length , we adopt limber s equation @xcite . in the rayleigh - jeans region",

    "the requirement @xmath256 is easily satisfied .",
    "the measurement of the intergalactic gas at redshift z requires the galaxy survey at least up to that redshift ( equation [ eqn : phim ] ) , so we need deeper galaxy survey in order to probe the gas beyond @xmath257 .",

    "we always have @xmath281 , @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",
    "our redshift extraction method works well with @xmath285 in this region .",

    "our redshift deprojection method still works , but with a larger error .",
    "the discussion of the observational requirement is not affected at all .",

    "our knowledge on the non - gravitational heating is very limited , and presumably depends on the poorly understood physics of star formation and supernovae dynamics .",

    "we have surveyed two simple but different models of non - gravitational heating to demonstrate the range of effects it may have on the correlations .",
    "the above equations show the basic procedure to include the non - gravitational heating and the possible effects .",
    "so we do not plan to constrain to a highly hypothetical model and do the calculation .",
    "for the purpose of estimation , we may either assume a step function for @xmath298 ( @xmath299 for @xmath300 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath301 . ) or @xmath302 . the upper limit of @xmath7 parameter @xmath303 from cobe / firas @xcite put constraints on the value of @xmath304 and @xmath305 . for example ,",
    "when @xmath306 kev , @xmath307 or @xmath308 .",
    "further simplification can be made by taking the fitting formula of @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "we show some examples ( figure [ fig : newbias],[fig : newpp ] and [ fig : newr ] ) .",
    "when combining cmb experiments with galaxy surveys , we have four observables : @xmath119 , @xmath311 , @xmath312 and @xmath313 . if @xmath191 is not a strong function of time and scale , we can solve for @xmath314 . if the behavior of @xmath315 as discussed above",
    "is correct , we obtain the fifth observable @xmath316 from the small scale behavior of @xmath213 .",
    "let us now address some potential systematic shortcomings in our simplified model .",
    "( 1 ) our model relies on the adopted gas - dark matter density relation ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : gasw ] ) , the ( non - local ) temperature - density relation ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : temp ] ) and the non - gravitational heating . in case",
    "that only the gravitational heating is included , apart from intrinsic problems addressed in section [ sec : ps ] , our model contains two free parameters : the gas - dark matter smoothing length , and the temperature - potential smoothing length .",
    "these parameters only weakly affect the pressure power spectrum and pressure bias , which are defined in terms of dimensionless functions .",
    "the normalization is expressed in terms of the mass weighted temperature , @xmath63 .",
    "we see in table [ tble : tbar ] that the gas smoothing only has a small effect .",
    "a preheating of 1 kev as proposed by @xcite has a factor of order unity impact on the temperature , and about factor of 4 effect on the cmb anisotropy spectrum and 8 on the bispectrum , while the skewness will decrease by about 50% .",
    "we provide a convenient method to include such effects .",
    "hydro simulations are able to measure the gas - dm relation and the @xmath317 relation and will further improve our work . fortunately , the main goal of our model  the extraction of the 3-d gas information is least affected , since it depends only on the cross - correlation coefficient ( [ eqn : rkz ] ) and figure [ fig : r ] , which does not vary a lot even including non - gravitational heating . ( 2 ) the galaxy bias model we adopt may be too simple . in our redshift extraction method of the gas pressure power spectrum , the only bias dependency comes from @xmath191 . we speculate that , even for a realistic galaxy bias model , @xmath191 should be close to a constant , which still enable us to extract @xmath213 .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath318 .",
    "the value of @xmath318 in hept is a function of the power index of a power law power spectrum .",
    "we have extended it to the cdm power spectrum and choose the power index at @xmath319 .",
    "because sz effect is mainly contributed by the non - linear regime with @xmath320 , hept is applicable and the resulting @xmath101 does not vary a lot .",
    "more importantly , @xmath321 only has a weak dependence on @xmath94 .",
    "this behavior ensures that @xmath191 has least dependence on our assumptions about @xmath318 .",
    "we have presented a new tool to compute power spectra and other statistics of sz fluctuations based on hierarchical clustering and scaling .",
    "this approach describes the two point correlation of non - linear observables , such as the sz @xmath7 parameter in terms of two point correlation functions , which directly maps to the observed angular power spectrum .",
    "we have demonstrated that this approach is feasible , and produces results consistent with simulations and press - schechter approaches .",
    "we then addressed the problem of measuring the redshift evolution of the sz effect through cross correlation with galaxy surveys containing coarse photometric redshift information .",
    "we have shown that a variational method allows the redshift deconvolution which does not depend on galaxy biasing . the only model dependent quantity is the cross correlation coefficient @xmath177 between galaxies and gas pressure , whose value has least dependence on the gas density model and the gas temperature model .",
    "our quantitative estimates suggest that , when combining cmb experiments either with high resolution such as amiba and south pole submillimeter telescope or with high sky coverage such as planck and deep broad photometric galaxy surveys such as sloan , our method is able to extract the redshift evolution information of intergalactic gas , such as the full time resolved gas pressure power spectrum , even without requiring the knowledge of galaxy bias",
    ". it is even capable of disentangling the contribution from the gravitational heating and those from the non - gravitational heating .",
    "this method serves as a powerful probe to this primary component of cosmic baryons to high redshift .",
    "the model also provides an alternative to simulations and the press - schechter formalism to calculate the cmb sz power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "we successfully reproduce , when no non - gravitational heating presents , the mass weighted gas temperature @xmath322 kev ) , the pressure power spectrum , the pressure bias ( @xmath323 , but scale dependent ) , the mean sz temperature distortion ( @xmath324 k ) , the sz power spectrum and the skewness parameter ( @xmath325 ) . with our transform formulas ,",
    "non - gravitational heating is easily included and we have estimated its effects on the correlations .",
