    "graphene , a hexagonally packed single layer of carbon atoms @xcite , is considered a strong candidate for post - silicon electronic devices . to meet this expectation , however , it is crucial to be able to open up a band gap at the fermi level , which exists in silicon and is necessary for a switchable device . since graphene has outstanding mechanical properties and capable of sustaining huge atomic distortions @xcite up to about 27% @xcite it becomes very interesting to use strain as a tool to introduce a band gap in graphene .",
    "the idea of strain - induced band gap has been theoretically explored by pereira _",
    "@xcite within the standard tight - binding ( tb ) approximation .",
    "the gap opening process involves merging of two inequivalent dirac points , @xmath4 and @xmath5pereira09,mont08,montambaux such a process requires some @xmath6 of stretching along the zigzag chains @xcite .",
    "the subsequent to ref . and",
    "more realistic _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations ni1 , ni2,choi confirmed that the strain along a _ zigzag _ direction is indeed the most effective in annihilating the dirac points .",
    "however , the ab - initio methods predicted even higher critical tensile strain ( @xmath7 ) than that obtained within the tight - binding model .",
    "moreover , it was discovered that annihilation of the dirac points does not _ automatically _ lead to a gap opening , because a @xmath8 conduction band quickly moves down towards the fermi level with the strain . as a result ,",
    "when the dirac points merge , the energy gap either does not open at all @xcite , or opens by a tiny 45 mev @xcite .",
    "thus , the results pereira09,ni2,choi suggest that a tangible gap in graphene is unlikely under uniaxial tensions up to the graphene failure strain of 25 - 27% lee , liu07,cadelano . the papers @xcite considered a tension accompanied by a poisson s contraction . using a tb approach , cocco _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have tried a uniform _ pure shear _ strain @xmath9 associated with the elastic constant @xmath10 .",
    "they claimed a moderate critical value of @xmath11 and expected it to lower down to @xmath12 if used along with the uniaxial strain in the armchair direction .",
    "the idea of using inhomogeneous strain fields @xmath13 with @xmath14 has also been studied extensively bearing on tb - derived notion of a pseudo - magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite it was claimed that two - dimensional corrugations with triangular symmetry open up a gap without a threshold @xcite .",
    "the local gaps in graphene ` bubbles ' have been reported in ref .  , while it was speculated that the one - dimensional corrugations ( ` wrinkles ' ) that are frequently observed in a suspended graphene could open up the gap but only in combination with alternating electrostatic gating correlated with the ` wrinkles ' @xcite .    here ,",
    "we pursue two goals with the use of ab - initio calculations applied similarly to our earlier study of a flexo - electric [ polarization induced by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ` sister ' system b - n monolayer @xcite .",
    "first , we show that contrary to ref .",
    "graphene s band structure remains gapless under _ any uniform strains _ not exceeding its breaking point .",
    "secondly , we demonstrate that the energy gap can be nevertheless induced mechanically by applying realistic _",
    "nonuniform _ sine - wave deformations ( similar to the ` wrinkles ' ) in all but the armchair directions , and _ without _ any periodic gating @xcite .",
    "the qualitative difference with tb - derived continuous pseudo - magnetic models ( see ref .   and references therein ) appears to be an account for strong @xmath19 overlap between neighboring @xmath20 orbitals on carbon atoms appearing at any flexing with @xmath21 in addition to the standard @xmath22 overlap , the only one retained in tb  models of graphene . since the rehybridization responsible for the gap opening is local , the results do not depend on standard procedure of employing supercell for the band structure calculations and atomic relaxation .",
    "another feature missing in the continuous flexo-`magnetic ' models is that they do not distinguish between flexing that is preserving an inversion symmetry versus a symmetry breaking one .",
    "we begin with defining the homogeneous and inhomogeneous ( sinusoidal ) deformations of graphene .",

    "the numerical calculations for both the flat and the corrugated graphene sheets have been performed using density functional theory implemented in the abinit package @xcite a 16@xmath7616@xmath761 monkhorst - pack @xmath77-point grid @xcite has been used in the case of flat graphene .",
    "approximately the same k - point density was kept in going from the planar to a corrugated graphene .",
    "the sheets have been simulated by a slab - supercell approach with the inter - planar distances of @xmath78 to ensure negligible wave function overlap between the replica sheets . for the plane - wave expansion of the valence and conduction band wave - functions ,",
    "a cutoff energy was chosen to be 80 ry",

    "have been considered as valence states .",
    "since any uniform strain respects the inversion symmetry , it can remove the dirac point degeneracy only if it can force the dirac points to merge , in compliance with the wigner - von neumann theorem .",
    "merging may only take place at a point located at half the reciprocal lattice vector , @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the integers @xcite .",
    "obviously , the dirac point can be moved with regards to the reciprocal vectors only when the strain comprises the shear @xmath81 . therefore , below we will distinguish three important cases of the _ homogeneous _ strain : ( i ) pure shear strain when @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 in ( [ eq : dx1 ] ) , ( ii ) uniaxial tension accompanied by poisson s transverse contraction , @xmath85 @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the poisson coefficient , and ( iii ) pure uniaxial tension ( @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 ) .",
    "we have performed detailed analysis with account for full atomic relaxation of the above cases ( i)-(iii ) exemplified by a graphene sheet under a tensile strain @xmath91 with varying conditions for a perpendicular strain . in this geometry , the dirac points merge in the case ( i ) , when @xmath92 , and the strain @xmath91 reaches @xmath93 , while in the cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) for @xmath91 exceeding @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "since the rate of @xmath96band lowering increases in passing from ( iii ) to ( ii ) and then from to ( ii ) to ( i ) , the gap is unable to open up in the cases ( i),(ii ) at all .",
    "although the gap does open up in the case ( iii ) , its maximal value is modest and does not exceed 100 mev since the antibonding @xmath96band quickly moves down in energy and closes the gap ( see fig .",

    "the gap between @xmath102 and @xmath103 states opens up , but not before the @xmath104 gap closes ( inset in ( a ) ) .",
    ", width=321 ]    the suppressing role of @xmath96band can be traced back to the fact that the uniaxial strain changes the bond lengths and bond angles between c - c bonds along the stretching direction and perpendicular to it .",
    "the @xmath105  hybrid tends to split into two @xmath106hybrids and the perpendicular to the stretching direction @xmath107chain states get progressively weaker coupled between themselves . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath96band derived from @xmath107 states quickly moves down at the point @xmath108 @xcite thus fully suppressing the gap .",
    "the above results are obtained in the local density approximation ( lda )  for the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) instead does not change the results significantly , even though gga usually favors gap opening .",
    "for instance , in the case ( ii ) gga gives the critical value for the gap opening @xmath109 with the maximal gap value of about 100 mev . keeping this in mind , below we present only the lda results .",
    "scanning all possible deformations ( i)-(iii ) corresponding to different angles @xmath110 shows that the gap opening is most problematic in the case of deformations involving stretching along the armchair directions . here , the @xmath111 , @xmath112 points should move the _ longest _ distance in @xmath43-space to meet each other , and the latter can happen only well above the mechanical breaking strain . at the same time , the _  pure shear _",
    "deformation conjugated to @xmath113 elastic modulus ( @xmath114 @xmath115 was found to be the most favorable for the dirac points merging , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "evolution of the band structure under such a strain is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2s ] . in this case , the conduction @xmath116band minimum moves down ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:2s]a ) and intercepts merging of two dirac points when shear strain reaches 17% , while the merging occurs only when graphene sheet is strained by about 22% .",
    "one concludes that the homogeneous strain is unable to open up a gap in graphene , contrary to the claim in ref .  .",
    "fortunately , the gap can be opened up in all but the armchair directions by the corrugation , with the maximal gap of about 0.5 ev for the zigzag direction .",
    "one can distinguish two qualitatively different regimes depending on a phase of the corrugation @xmath45 : ( a )  @xmath117 the inversion ( and time reversal ) symmetry is preserved , and ( b )  @xmath118 the inversion symmetry is generally broken .",
    "for the case ( a ) , we have calculated corrugation along the _ zigzag _ direction @xmath119 , @xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrzig ] .",
    "such a perturbation is momentum dependent preserving time reversal and inversion symmetry and therefore can not automatically open up the gap in the graphene sheet @xcite unless the dirac points are merged at some point @xmath121 montambaux in the case under consideration , the dirac point moves on the symmetry @xmath122 line in the folded bz , where @xmath123 and ` bounces ' off the @xmath124-point when @xmath125 is close to @xmath126 .",
    "finally , the dirac points merge at the @xmath75point .",
    "the gap opens up when @xmath127 exceeds a critical value of @xmath128 and quickly reaches a substantial size of 0.5 ev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrzig ] for @xmath129 ( see also fig .  [",

    "the dirac ponts merge and the gap opens up when the corrugation is slightly smaller than @xmath133 . , width=321 ]     with @xmath134 and the phase @xmath135 breaking the inversion symmetry .",
    "the dirac cones detach at @xmath136 and after that their remainders evolve differently with corrugation forming the indirect gap ( b),(c ) . , width=302 ]    for possible applications , it is important to establish if the gap can be opened up when corrugation runs in a general _ chiral direction _ with an arbitrary phase @xmath137 .",
    "band structure of graphene subject to a corrugation along a ` chiral ' direction ,",
    "@xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath134 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chir ] .",
    "since @xmath140 and the inversion symmetry is broken , the gap opens up at any @xmath141 however , the gap is very small if the ` pseudo ' dirac points remain well inside the bz , which is the case for small corrugations . when the dirac points approach the bz boundary with increasing corrugation , the minimum of the conduction and the maximum of the valence band move apart in @xmath142-space .",
    "consequently , the initially small gap grows to ( indirect ) gap of 0.5 ev , fig .",
    "[ fig : chir ] .",
    "we should stress that in several aspects our results are in contrast with the gap behavior claimed on the basis of the continuous flexo-`magnetic ' models @xcite .",
    "first , the latter are oblivious of the presence of the inversion symmetry or its lack thereof @xcite . as a result",
    ", they are missing the important increase in the gap size from trivially expected minute value in the symmetry - breaking case to large values when the remainders of the dirac cones approach the bz boundaries , fig .",
    "[ fig : chir ] .",
    "second , even if the inversion symmetry is preserved , the gap can still open up when corrugation exceeds some limiting value .",
    "such a gap opening does not require any periodic gating correlated with the corrugation suggested in @xcite . and third , it has been claimed that one - dimensional corrugations lead to creation of flat bands and a build up of the density of states ( dos )  at the dirac ( neutral ) point mikmidgap08,guinea .",
    "these partially flat bands are believed to be analogs of the zero - energy landau levels because the ripples affect the electrons like an effective magnetic field .",
    "below , we show that in reality no flat bands occur since the dirac points are stable up to the deformation where the system transforms into a metal .    as in ref . , we restrict ourselves to the limiting case of the armchair direction @xmath143 with the inversion symmetry being preserved .",
    "such a corrugation has a period of @xmath144 , where @xmath145 ( the unit used in ref .  ) . when @xmath146 , there are @xmath147 conduction @xmath148 bands and @xmath149 valence @xmath103 bands in the @xmath150 direction perpendicular to @xmath151 and containing a dirac point ( in the supercell bz ) @xcite .",
    "of these @xmath149 bands ( conduction or valence ) , two are nondegenerate and @xmath152 are doubly degenerate @xcite .",
    "the @xmath153 and @xmath103 bands that form a dirac cone are always nondegenerate ( except for the dirac point itself ) .",
    "when the corrugation is induced ( @xmath154 ) , all the doubly degenerate bands split due to breaking of the mirror symmetry . as @xmath125 is further increased , the lowest in energy split @xmath155 band and the highest in energy split @xmath156 band start moving toward the fermi level , due to a change in the @xmath157 hopping matrix elements and increasing @xmath158 and @xmath159 hybridization .    to be more specific , consider the ripples with @xmath160 and @xmath161 , fig .",
    "[ fig:4s ] . here ,",
    "the closest to the dirac cone are the conduction and valence bands residing inside the dirac cone almost symmetrically ( @xmath146 , fig .  [ fig:4s ] ) .",
    "such a relative position of the bands can be easily predicted by using the `` band - folding '' procedure . as the @xmath125 increases , the degenerate @xmath97 and @xmath103 states split and repel each other , so that the lower / upper singly degenerate @xmath97/@xmath103 state lowers / rises in energy . by approaching the dirac cone ,",
    "these two states considerably deform the latter . at some critical moment ( @xmath1620.145 ) ,",
    "the moving @xmath97 and @xmath103 bands reach the fermi level leading to a peak in the dos at the fermi level ( due to the evident van hove singularities ) . in ref .",
    ", this situation was interpreted as a formation of a flat pseudo - landau level . in reality , however , we face here a peculiar _ electronic topological transition _ of the type semimetal - metal when the bottom of the @xmath163 band and the top of the @xmath103 band pass the fermi level simultaneously .",
    "it is clear that such a transition is accompanied by electrons flowing from the @xmath103 to the @xmath97 band .    , with amplitude to period ratio @xmath164 and the phase @xmath120 preserving the inversion symmetry .",
    "the @xmath165 direction is perpendicular to the rippling direction .",
    "note that the bands are defined in order of energy.,width=332 ]     as a function of the corrugation parameter @xmath166 .",
    "the critical corrugation ( @xmath167 significantly increases in passing from the quenched to annealed ripple structures . the annealed structure at ( @xmath167 is shown in the insert . ( b ) for a corrugated graphene placed on a hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) substrate .",
    "it is supposed that the connection with the substrate is only partially coherent : within the period only four graphene atomic lines are in registry with h - bn lattice ( shown by vertical dotted lines in the insert).,width=340 ]    so far , we considered sine - wave deformations with only flexural ( out - of - plane ) atomic displacements .",
    "such deformations are accompanied by the stretching @xmath168 which can be relieved by allowing the atoms to relax at a given amplitude @xmath1 . `",
    "annealing ' increases the initial quenched ratio @xmath125 because @xmath169 shrinks trying to restore the initial nearest - neighbor spacing .",
    "since , on the other hand , the pace of movement of the dirac points with @xmath1 in the relaxed structures is slower , the critical corrugation ( @xmath170 for the gap opening becomes considerably higher .",
    "for example , the annealing of the corrugated structure @xmath119 increases the critical corrugation from 0.12 to @xmath171 0.5 , fig .",
    "fig : gonbna .",
    "it is important that in the relaxed structures , the @xmath172 band is affected significantly less than in the case of a stretched lattice and , therefore , one may open up a wider gap ( @xmath173 ev ) .",
    "it is clear from the above that the periodicity of the corrugations must not necessarily be commensurate with the undistorted graphene lattice or even sine - like for the gap opening .",
    "the commensurability between the deformation and the lattice itself would be important if the energy gap were due to mixing of electronic states belonging to two different valleys @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "however , in the case of 1d periodic corrugations this does not occur even if the corrugations provide a momentum transfer of @xmath176 ( as in fig.1 ) the gap opens only due to ( i ) breaking of the inversion symmetry and/or ( ii ) merging of two inequivalent dirac points , as explained above .",
    "we simulated , for example , the situation when a corrugated graphene is placed on a hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) and only a fraction of its atomic lines are in registry with h - bn .",
    "such a partially coherent connection with the substrate maintains gaussian - like periodic corrugations that we may call a ` mesh ' ( see the insert in fig .  [ fig : gonbn]b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gonbn]b , we present the results for a particular case when the graphene is deformed in such a way that its initial period @xmath119 becomes commensurate with the bn period @xmath177 .",
    "we see that the corrugation leads to a gap of 0.20 ev .  in practice",
    ", the periodic deformations can be achieved in various ways .",
    "one can imagine a situation when the edges are not clamped and a graphene membrane bends in accordion - like fashion .",
    "this situation corresponds to the ` annealed ' corrugations where the initial nearest - neighbor lengths are mainly preserved .",
    "the ` quenched ' corrugations can be induced by depositing graphene on a substrate like sio@xmath178 @xcite or the vicinal surfaces with regularly spaced steps , like au(788 ) @xcite . in the case of sio@xmath178 , for example , the interaction energy between the graphene sheet and the substrate is sufficient to overcome the elastic energy needed for graphene to conform to the sio@xmath178 surface profile @xcite .    in conclusion , we have shown that any practical _ homogeneous _ deformation can not open up a gap in graphene sheets . at the same time , the _ inhomogeneous _ deformation can open up a significant gap ( @xmath171 1 ev ) rather independently of direction and form of a corrugation with an exception of an armchair direction .",
    "the present gap opening does not require any periodic gating correlated with the corrugation@xcite either .",
    "it is worth noting that in the limit of a clean undoped graphene sheet , the coulomb interaction between electron and hole carriers may become significant if the coulomb coupling constant exceeds some critical value on the order of unity and may facilitate an excitonic gap in the spectrum khvesh09 .",
    "however , in practical cases the coulomb interaction may be screened by ( unintentional )  doping . since a multilayer graphene ( mlg)/graphite is a stack of weakly coupled graphene sheets @xcite , most of above results , therefore",
    ", should apply to the inhomogeneously deformed mlg as well ."
