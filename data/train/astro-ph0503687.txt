    "microlensing is one of the most important methods that can detect and characterize extrasolar planets ( see the review of perryman 2000 ) .",
    "microlensing planet detection is possible because planets can induce perturbations to the standard lensing light curves produced by primary stars . once the perturbation is detected and analyzed , one can determine the mass ratio , @xmath0 , and the projected separation , @xmath1 ( normalized by the einstein ring radius @xmath2 ) , between the planet and host star @xcite .",
    "recently , a clear - cut microlensing detection of an exoplanet was reported by @xcite .",
    "planet detection via microlensing is observationally challenging .",
    "one of the most important difficulties in detecting planets via microlensing lies in the fact that planet - induced perturbations last for a short period of time . for a jupiter - mass planet ,",
    "the duration is only a few days and it decreases as @xmath3 . to achieve high monitoring frequency required for planet detections ,",
    "current lensing experiments are employing early warning system to issue alerts of ongoing events in the early stage of lensing magnification @xcite and follow - up observation programs to intensively monitor the alerted events @xcite .",
    "however , follow - up is generally done with small field - of - view instrument , and thus events should be monitored sequentially . as a result , only a handful number of events can be followed at any given time , limiting the number of planet detections .",
    "an observational strategy that can dramatically increase the planet detection efficiency was proposed by @xcite .",
    "when a microlensing event is caused by a star possessing a planet , two sets of caustics are produced . among them , one is located away from the primary lens ( planetary caustic ) and the other is located close to the primary lens ( central caustic ) . the location of the planetary caustic varies depending on the planetary separation @xmath1 , which is not known , and thus it is impossible to predict the time of planetary perturbation in advance .",
    "on the other hand , the central caustic is always located very close to the primary lens , and thus the central perturbation occurs near the peak of high - magnification events .",
    "therefore , by focusing on high - magnification events , it is possible to dramatically increase the planet detection efficiency , enabling one to maximize the number of planet detections with a limited use of resources and time @xcite .",
    "an additional use of high magnification events was noticed by @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that multiple planets with separations @xmath4",
    " @xmath5 of the einstein ring radius @xmath2 significantly affect the central region of the magnification pattern regardless of the orientation and thus microlensing can be used to detect multiple - planet systems .",
    "they noted , however , that characterizing the detected multiple - planet systems by analyzing the central perturbations would be difficult due to the complexity of the magnification pattern combined with the large number of lensing parameters required to model multiple - planet systems .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that in many cases the central planetary perturbations induced by multiple planets can be well approximated by the superposition of the single - planetary perturbations where the individual planet - primary pairs act as independent binary lens systems ( binary superposition ) .",
    "the validity of the binary - superposition approximation implies that a simple single - planet lensing model is possible for the description of the anomalies produced by the individual planet components , enabling better characterization of these systems .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in   2 , we describe the multiple - planetary lensing and magnification pattern in the central region . in   3 , we illustrate the validity of th binary - superposition approximation in describing the central magnification pattern of multiple - planet systems . in   4 , we discuss the usefulness of the superposition approximation in the interpretation of the multiple planetary signals .",
    "the equation of lens mapping from the lens plane to the source plane ( lens equation ) of an @xmath6 point masses is expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the complex notations of the source , lens , and image positions , respectively , @xmath11 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the masses of the individual lens components , @xmath14 is the total mass of the system , and thus @xmath15 represent the mass fractions of the individual lens components . here",
    "all angles are normalized to the einstein ring radius of the total mass of the system , @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17^{1/2 } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively .",
    "the lensing process conserves the source surface brightness , and thus the magnifications @xmath20 of the individual images correspond to the ratios between the areas of the images and source . for an infinitesimally small source element , the magnification is , @xmath21 the total magnification is the sum over all images , @xmath22 .    for a single lens ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "the lens equation is simply inverted to solve the image positions @xmath24 and magnifications for given lens @xmath25 and source @xmath26 positions .",
    "this yields the familiar result that there are two images with magnifications and separations from the lens of @xmath27 and @xmath28 $ ] , respectively , where @xmath29 is the separation between the lens and source and @xmath30 $ ] is the total magnification .",
    "a planetary lensing with a single planet is described by the formalism of a binary ( @xmath31 ) lens . in this case",
    ", the lens equation can not be inverted algebraically .",
    "however , it can be expressed as a fifth - order polynomial in @xmath12 and the image positions are then obtained by numerically solving the polynomial @xcite .",
    "one important characteristic of binary lensing is the formation of caustics , which represent the set of source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinite .",
    "planetary perturbations on lensing light curves occur when the source approaches close to the caustics .",
    "the location and size of these caustics depend on the projected separation @xmath1 and the mass ratio @xmath0 . for a planetary case ,",
    "there exist two sets of disconnected caustics .",
    "the planetary caustic(s ) is ( are ) located away from the primary star on or very close to the star - planet axis with a separation from the primary star of @xmath32 .",
    "the central caustic , on the other hand , is located close to the primary lens with a size of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "caustics are located within the einstein ring when the planetary separation is within the range of @xmath34 .",
    "the size of the caustic , which is directly proportional to the planet detection efficiency , is maximized when the planet is located within this range , and thus this range is referred as `` lensing zone '' @xcite .    for a multiple - lens system , the lens equation is equivalent to a polynomial with an order of ( @xmath35 . therefore , a multiple - lens system produces a maximum of @xmath36 and a minimum of @xmath37 images , with the number of images changing by multiple of two as the source crosses a caustic @xcite . for a system with two planets ( and thus @xmath38 ) , there are thus a maximum of 10 images and a minimum of 4 images . unlike the caustics of binary lensing ,",
    "those of multiple lensing can exhibit self - intersecting and nesting .",
    "the mass ratio of a planet to its primary star is very small , and thus the lensing behavior of planet - induced anomalies can be treated as perturbation @xcite . due to the perturbative nature of planetary anomalies , it was known that the magnification pattern in the region around _",
    "planetary _ caustics of multiple - planet systems can be described by the superposition of those of the single - planet systems where the individual planet - primary pairs acts as independent binary lens systems @xcite , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 represent the magnifications of the exact multiple lensing , binary - superposition approximation , binary lensing with the pairs of the primary and individual planets , and single - mass lensing of the primary alone , respectively . by contrast",
    ", it was believed that the binary - superposition approximation would not be adequate to describe the magnification pattern in the central region because the central caustics produced by the individual planet components reside at the same central region and thus non - linear interference of the perturbations would be large .    unlike this belief about the magnification pattern in the central perturbation region , we find that non - linear interference between the perturbations produced by the individual planets of a multiple - planet system is important only in a small confined region very close to the central caustics .",
    "this implies that in many cases binary - superposition approximation can also be used for the description of the magnification pattern in the central perturbation region .    to demonstrate the validity of the binary - superposition approximation in the central region",
    ", we construct a set of _ magnification excess _ maps of example multiple - planet systems containing two planets with various orientations .",
    "the magnification excess represents the deviation of the magnification from the single - mass lensing as a function of the source position @xmath26 , and it is computed by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the magnification of the triple ( primary star plus two planets ) lensing .    in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the constructed contour ( drawn by black lines ) maps of magnification excess . in the map ,",
    "the parameters of planet 1 are held fixed at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while the projected separation @xmath48 and the angle between the position vectors to the individual planets from the primary star ( orientation angle ) , @xmath49 , are varied for a second planet with @xmath50 .",
    "greyscale is used to represent positive ( bright , @xmath51 ) and negative ( dark ) deviation regions .",
    "also drawn are the contours ( drawn in white lines ) of magnification excess based on binary - superposition approximation , i.e. , @xmath52 for the maps based on binary superposition , we consider slight shift of the effective lensing position of the primary star ( @xmath53 ) toward the individual planets ( @xmath54 ) with an amount of @xcite @xmath55 to better show the magnification pattern in the very central region and the detailed caustic structure , we enlarge the maps and presented them in figure  [ fig : two ] . in each map ,",
    "the figures drawn in thick black and white lines represent the caustics for the cases of the exact triple lensing and binary superposition , respectively .    from the comparison of the excess maps constructed by the exact triple lensing and binary - superposition approximation",
    ", one finds that binary superposition is a good approximation in most of the central perturbation region as demonstrated by the good match between the two sets of contours .",
    "slight deviation of the binary - superposition approximation from the exact lensing magnification occurs ( a ) in a small region very close to the central caustics and ( b ) in the narrow regions along the primary - planet axes .",
    "this can be better seen in figure  [ fig : three ] , where we present the greyscale maps for the difference between the excesses of the triple lensing and binary - superposition approximation , i.e. , @xmath56 the difference in the region close to the central caustics is caused by the non - linear interference between the perturbations produced by the individual planets . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference along the primary - planet axes is caused by the slight positional shift of the triple - lensing caustics due to the introduction of an additional planet .",
    "however , the area of the deviation region , in general , is much smaller than the total area of the perturbation region , and thus the binary superposition approximation is able to well describe most part of planetary anomalies in lensing light curves .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : four ] , where we present example light curves of multiple - planetary lensing events and compare them to those obtained by binary superposition .",
    "the lensing behavior of a multiple planetary system is determined by many parameters including @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , and binary - superposition might not be a good approximation in some space region of these parameters .",
    "we therefore investigate the region of parameter space where binary - superposition is a poor approximation .",
    "due to the numerousness of the parameters , we choose a method of investigation where we inquire the validity of the approximation on the individual parameters by varying one parameter and fixing other parameters .",
    "the validity of the approximation is quantified by the ratio of @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 represent the area of the central perturbation region and the area of the difference region between the exact triple lensing and the binary - superposition approximation , respectively . in some cases , the perturbation regions caused by the planetary and central caustics are connected , making the boundary between the two regions ambiguous .",
    "we thus define the central perturbation region as the region within the lens - source impact parameter of @xmath63 ( corresponding to the region with magnifications @xmath64 ) . the areas @xmath62 and @xmath61 are computed by setting the threshold values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .    in figures  [ fig : five ] , [ fig : six ] , and [ fig : seven ] , we present the dependence of @xmath67 on the orientation angle ( @xmath49 ) , the mass ratios of the component planets ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , and the separations to them ( @xmath59 and @xmath48 ) , respectively .",
    "from the variation of @xmath67 depending on the orientation angle , we find that the difference between the exact lensing and binary - superposition approximation becomes bigger as @xmath49 decreases and thus the two planets are located closer to each other .",
    "we interpret this tendency as the increase of the non - linear interference between the perturbations caused by the two planets as the separation between them decreases . from the dependence on the mass ratio and separation",
    ", we find that binary superposition becomes a poor approximation as either the planet mass increases or the separation approaches to unity .",
    "these tendencies are the natural results of the breakdown of the perturbation treatment for companions with high mass ratios and ( or ) separations of @xmath68 , because the perturbation treatment is valid when @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "besides these extreme regions of parameter space , however , we find that @xmath71 in most regions , implying that binary - superposition approximation well describes the lensing behavior of most multiple planetary systems .",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrated that lensing magnification patterns of multiple - planet systems can be described by using binary - superposition approximation not only in the region around planetary caustics but also in most part of the central perturbation region . in this section",
    ", we discuss the importance of the binary - superposition approximation in the analysis and characterization of multiple - planet systems to be detected via microlensing .    exact description of lensing behavior of events caused by multiple - planet systems requires a large number of parameters . even for the simplest case of a two - planet system , the number of parameters is ten , including four single - lensing parameters of the einstein timescale @xmath72 , time of the closest lens - source approach @xmath73 , lens - source impact parameter @xmath74 , and blended light fraction @xmath75 , and another four parameters of the two sets of the planetary separation and mass ratio , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and the source trajectory angle @xmath78 and the orientation angle @xmath49 . as a result , it was believed that analyzing anomalies produced by multiple planets would be a daunting task .    with the validity of binary - superposition approximation",
    ", however , the analysis can be greatly simplified because the anomalies induced by the individual planets can be investigated separately by using relatively much simpler single - planetary lensing analysis .",
    "anomalies for which this type of analysis is directly applicable are those where the perturbations induced by the individual planets are well separated , e.g. , the anomalies in the lensing light curves presented in figure  [ fig : four ] with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .    in some cases , the region of perturbations caused by the individual planets",
    "are located close together and thus part of the anomalies in lensing light curves can be blended together . however , even in these cases , the non - linear interference between the anomalies is important only in small confined regions and thus the superposition approximation would still be valid for a large portion of the anomalies , allowing rough estimation of the separations and mass ratios of the individual planets .",
    "once these rough parameters are determined , then fine tuning of the parameters by using exact multiple - planet analysis will be possible by exploring the parameter space that was greatly narrowed down .",
    "however , care is required for the case when the two perturbations caused by the individual planets happen to locate at the same position ( or very close to each other ) .",
    "this case occurs when the two planets are aligned ( @xmath85 ) or anti - aligned ( @xmath86 ) . in this case",
    ", the anomaly appears to be caused by a single planet and thus naive analysis of the anomalies can result in wrong characterization of the planet system .",
    "however , this type of anomalies will be very rare .",
    "we would like to thank a. gould for making useful comments on the paper .",
