    "the physics of exotic nuclei with unusual @xmath5 ratios ( isospin ) has attracted world - wide attention . these nuclei are usually loosely bound and often exhibit resonances with a pronounced single - particle character since the fermi surface approaches the continuum . in some nuclei , the valence nucleons can be easily scattered into single - particle resonant states ( or gamow states ) in the continuum which is essential for the existence of exotic phenomena .",
    "for example , the halo in @xmath6li  @xcite can be successfully reproduced  @xcite and giant halo nuclei  @xcite are predicted by the relativistic continuum hartree - bogoliubov ( rchb ) theory  @xcite in which the contribution from the continuum has been proven to be crucial to understand these halo phenomena .",
    "there are also other attempts to include the contribution from the continuum in the non - relativistic  @xcite and relativistic approaches  @xcite . by taking into account a few resonant states close to the continuum threshold with the bcs method  @xcite , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory seems to be able to reproduce the rchb results and describe the main effects of the continuum .",
    "it has also been shown that the contribution of the continuum to the giant resonances mainly comes from gamow states  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a proper treatment of resonant states is important for a deeper understanding of the properties in exotic nuclei .",
    "presently , several techniques have been developed to study resonant states in the continuum .",
    "one of them is the r - matrix theory in which resonance parameters ( i.e. energy and width ) can be reasonably determined from fitting the available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the extended r - matrix theory  @xcite and the k - matrix theory  @xcite have also been developed .",
    "the conventional scattering theory is also an efficient tool for studying resonances .",
    "more precisely , the phase shift method is commonly used to determine parameters for a resonant state which corresponds to a pole of the s matrix  @xcite . by discretizing the continuum ,",
    "the contribution of the resonant states can be self - consistently taken into account via a bogoliubov transformation in coordinate space  @xcite .",
    "computationally , it is desired to deduce the properties of unbound states from the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of hamiltonians for bound states so that the methods developed for bound states can still be used . for this purpose ,",
    "the bound - state - type methods have been developed , including the real stabilization method  @xcite , the complex scaling method ( csm )  @xcite , and the analytic continuation in the coupling constant ( accc ) method  @xcite . in the real stabilization method ,",
    "the continuum is discretized in a box and the resonance can be found according to the fact that its energy should be stable against the change of the box size .",
    "sometimes it is difficult to find the appropriate box sizes , and it also turns out that this approach is suitable for narrow resonances only  @xcite . in the csm , the wave function for a resonant state is transformed to the square - integrable wave function for a bound state by rotating the position vector in coordinate space into the complex plane . since the csm involves the calculations of complex matrix elements , the corresponding difficulties related to complex eigenvalue problem still exist . in the accc method",
    ", a resonant state becomes a bound state if one increases the attractive potential and the energy , width and wave function for the resonant state can be obtained by an analytic continuation carried out via a @xmath2 approximant ( pa ) from the bound - state solutions . compared with other bound - state - type methods , the accc approach is very effective and numerically quite simple because many methods available for bound - state problems can be used and the pa for analytic continuation can be implemented easily .    within the framework of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation",
    ", the accc method has been applied to investigate the energies and widths for resonant states in light nuclei combined with few - body methods  @xcite , and to study single - particle resonant states in spherical and deformed nuclei by solving the schrdinger equation with woods - saxon potentials  @xcite .",
    "based on the schrdinger and dirac equations , the stability and convergence of the energies and widths for single - particle resonant states with square - well , harmonic - oscillator and woods - saxon potentials have been investigated and their dependence on the coupling constant interval and the order of the pa have been discussed in detail  @xcite .    the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory is widely used to describe properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei successfully , not only for those nuclei near the valley of stability , but also for exotic nuclei with large neutron ( proton ) excess  @xcite . previously the accc method was employed to study energies and widths for resonant states in stable nuclei @xmath7o and @xmath8ca in rmf theory  @xcite . in the present work , we aim at exploring the single - particle resonant states , including resonance parameters and wave functions , in exotic nuclei by the accc method within the framework of the rmf theory .",
    "this paper represents the first application of the rmf - accc method to obtain both the wave functions and resonance parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the accc method combined with the rmf theory is presented .",
    "the numerical details are given in sec .",
    "iii and its application to the doubly magic nucleus @xmath3zr in sec .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary in sec .",
    "the basic ansatz of the rmf theory is a lagrangian density whereby nucleons are described as dirac particles which interact via the exchange of various mesons ( the scalar @xmath9 , vector @xmath10 and iso - vector vector @xmath11 ) and the photon  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nucleon mass and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are the masses ( coupling constants ) of the respective mesons . a nonlinear scalar self - interaction @xmath20 of the @xmath9 meson has been included  @xcite .",
    "the field tensors for the vector mesons are given as @xmath21    the classical variation principle gives the following equations of motion @xmath22       \\psi_i ~=~ \\epsilon_i\\psi_i , \\label{spinor1}\\ ] ] for the nucleon spinors , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the single - particle energy and spinor wave function respectively , and the klein - gordon equations @xmath25 for the mesons , where @xmath26 are the vector and scalar potentials respectively and the source terms for the mesons are @xmath27 it should be noted that the contribution of negative energy states are neglected , i.e. , the vacuum is not polarized .",
    "moreover , the mean field approximation is carried out via replacing meson field operators in eq .",
    "( [ spinor1 ] ) by their expectation values , since the coupled equations eq .",
    "( [ spinor1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ mesonmotion ] ) are nonlinear quantum field equations and their exact solutions are very complicated . in this way ,",
    "the nucleons are assumed to move independently in the classical meson fields .",
    "the coupled equations can be solved self - consistently by iteration .    for spherical nuclei , the potential of the nucleon and the sources of meson fields depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "the spinor is characterized by the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the isospin @xmath32 for neutron and proton respectively , and the other quantum number @xmath33 .",
    "the dirac spinor has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the spinor spherical harmonics .",

    "( [ dirac - r ] ) and ( [ ramesonmotion ] ) in a meshed box of size @xmath45 self - consistently , one can calculate the ground state properties of a nucleus .",
    "the vector potential @xmath46 and the scalar potential @xmath47 , energies and wave functions for bound states are also obtained . by increasing the attractive potential as @xmath48 ,",
    "a resonant state will be lowered and becomes a bound state if the coupling constant @xmath49 is large enough .",
    "near the branch point @xmath50 , defined by the scattering threshold @xmath51  @xcite , the wave number @xmath52 behaves as @xmath53 these properties suggest an analytic continuation of the wave number @xmath54 in the complex @xmath49 plane from the bound - state region into the resonance region by @xmath2 approximant of the second kind ( paii )  @xcite @xmath55}(x)= i \\dfrac{c_0+c_1 x+c_2x^2+\\ldots + c_lx^l } { 1+d_1 x+d_2 x^2+\\ldots+d_n x^n},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the coefficients of pa .",

    "one can also prove that the wave function @xmath73 is an analytic function of the wave number @xmath54 in the inner region @xmath74 where the jost function analyticity dominates  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the technique , which has been adopted to find the complex resonance energy , to determine the resonance wave function @xmath71 .",
