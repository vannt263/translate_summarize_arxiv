    "spiral structures in galaxies have been extensively studied , including the nature and number of arms and values for pitch angles , which measure how tightly wound are the spirals .",
    "one characteristic of spirals that has received little attention is the width of arms . for the milky way",
    ", recent measurements of parallax of molecular masers associated with newly formed massive stars have indicated that the widths of spiral arms , estimated from the scatter of these sources about a segment of a spiral arm , increases with galactocentric distance @xcite .",
    "assuming that the milky way is not atypical among spiral galaxies , one might expect a similar increase in arm widths with radius in other late - type spirals . whereas the measurement of arm width for the milky way is difficult",
    ", owing to our location within the galactic disk and the difficulty of obtaining accurate distance measurements at characteristic distances from the sun of @xmath0 kpc , it should be straight - forward in external galaxies .",
    "thus , we undertook a detailed study of the patterns of giant  regions in four nearby , nearly face - on , late - type galaxies that display clear spiral structure .",
    "we use the locations of giant  regions as tracers of spiral structure .",
    "the galaxy images used for measurement of the locations of  regions are documented in section [ sect : measurements ] , along with the methods used to determine positions .",
    "our approach to fitting segments of spiral patterns to these data is presented in section [ sect : fitting ] .",
    "the results for each galaxy are given in section [ sect : results ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : characteristics ] , we discuss the characteristics of the spiral arms and compare these characteristics to those of the milky way .",
    "table  [ table : galaxies ] lists information about the images of the four galaxies studied in this paper .",
    "all of the images are publicly available on the internet , and we selected high resolution images in   or blue - filtered emission to maximize the contrast of  regions with respect to the background continuum emission from the galaxy .",
    "images were either downloaded in the flexible image transport system ( fits ) format or were converted to that format using the imagemagick program `` convert '' available at http://www.imagemagick.org .",
    "we also used this software to prepare images for display in our figures .",

    "we used the task jmfit to estimate positions by fitting two - dimensional elliptical gaussian brightness distributions to individual sub - regions within an image that each contained one  region .",
    "foreground stars in the milky way were easily recognized as point - like objects , usually with diffraction spikes , and excluded .",
    "contamination of our region sample by other objects ( supernova remnants or planetary nebulae ) should not be significant for these  or blue - filtered images .",
    "fitted positions were obtained in pixel units , and we used the pixel scale and assumed galaxy distance to translate these to physical scales in kiloparsec units . note that we often adjusted the image display transfer functions when preparing sub - regions of a galaxy for measurement , and that many  regions are not visible on the low dynamic - range figures published in this paper .",
    "we also measured the position of the bright center of each galaxy and subtracted this position from each  region position in order to translate to galactocentric coordinates .",
    "we made no attempt to deproject the  region positions for these galaxies , which are within about @xmath2 from a face - on orientation .",
    "the galactic positions for all  regions are available as on - line material .",
    "we fit segments of spiral arms to the positions of  regions using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo technique .",
    "the adopted model is a log - periodic spiral given by @xmath3 where  is galactocentric azimuth defined as zero toward the north and increasing east of north ,  is the galactocentric radius at azimuth , and @xmath4 is the spiral pitch angle .",
    "the parameter  was assigned the average of the measured  region azimuths , leaving two parameters to be solved for :  and @xmath4 .",
    "since , the precision in measuring an  region position ( @xmath5 pc ) is significantly better than the intrinsic scatter in their positions about a best - fit spiral segment ( @xmath6 pc ) , we also solved for an arm - width parameter ( @xmath7 ) to characterize the scatter and to allow for this source of astrophysical noise when fitting a spiral .",
    "( while there can be many definitions of arm width , throughout this paper we adopt a gaussian ( @xmath8 ) approximation to the distribution of the minimum distances of  regions from the model arm segment . )",
    "we calculated likelihood functions from the weighted residuals , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the minimum distance of the @xmath11  region from the model spiral ( evaluated numerically ) and @xmath7 is its `` uncertainty '' owing to intrinsic scatter within the arm .",
    "we randomly generated trials ( markov chains ) of the two parameters characterizing the spiral arm segment (  and @xmath4 ) and the parameter characterizing the width of the spiral arm ( @xmath7 ) and accepted / rejected these trials with the metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "we employed two likelihood functions in our analysis : an `` error - tolerant '' likelihood function ( see  a conservative formulation  by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) given by @xmath12 and a least - squares likelihood function given by @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the number of measured  regions .",
    "note the factor @xmath14 in the likelihoods , often a constant and ignored , is retained here since we vary its value in order to estimate arm width .",
    "the error - tolerant likelihood function is relatively insensitive to outlying data points and was used to find and then remove interarm  regions from the sample in an unbiased fashion .",
    "we accomplished this by fitting with the eq .",
    "( 2 ) likelihood and discarding   regions with @xmath15 deviations . after this preliminary editing",
    ", we fitted the spiral with the least - squares likelihood ( eq .",
    "3 ) . usually ,",
    "at this stage , all residuals were @xmath16 , but occasionally one or two  regions with residuals just above @xmath17 were encountered . in these cases ,",
    "the outliers were removed from the sample and the spiral re - fitted .",
    "we first fitted a single log - periodic spiral to all  regions in a given arm .",
    "such `` global '' fits usually revealed systematic departures from a constant pitch angle model .",
    "since we would like to investigate the possible increase in arm width along the arm , we re - fit each arm with spiral segments of length roughly 5 to 10 kpc .",
    "the boundaries for the arm segments were chosen based on three criteria : 1 ) breaks in the density or scatter of  regions , 2 ) apparent changes in the local pitch angles among segments , and 3 ) to keep comparably sized samples of  regions among the segments in one arm .",
    "fitting short arm segments also has the advantage of minimizing systematic error in the width estimates , owing to the simplification of the assumed spiral model .",
    "marginalized posteriori probability density functions ( pdfs ) were obtained from binned histograms of the individual parameter values for all trials . since the pdfs were approximately gaussian in shape , we adopted the center and half - width of the 68% confidence intervals as best estimates of the parameter values and @xmath8 uncertainties .",
    "the image of  ( ) is displayed in the left panel of figure [ fig : ngc628 ] .",
    "this galaxy has two prominent spiral arms that wind counterclockwise with increasing distance from the galactic center .",

    "( 1 ) to all  region positions gives a global pitch angle of @xmath18 , although it is clear that a single pitch angle is not a good fit over the entire arm . in the second arm , labeled `` b '' , we located 427  regions between distances of about 4 to 13 kpc and find a global pitch angle of @xmath19 . this global fit is better than for arm a , but still shows some small systematic deviations from a constant pitch angle form .",
    "we divided arm a into three segments and arm b into four segments , as indicated in table [ table : ngc628_characteristics ] .",
    "spiral fits revealed significant changes in pitch angle among the segments in arm a , but only small changes among segments in arm b. for both arms , the estimated arm widths increase with increasing radius , with the exception of the last segment of arm b , where some narrowing occurs .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "often these use fourier or other automated techniques that can efficiently analyze large samples of galaxies using integrated light .",
    "our work differs by directly fitted spirals to the locations of  regions , which allows a detailed and robust evaluation of the characteristics of spiral arms without assuming uniform properties over an entire arm or galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : pitchangles ] shows the measured pitch angles of the segments of spiral arms in our sample of galaxies .",
    "most pitch angles for these galaxies are between about 10  and 30 , comparable to the range found by @xcite for sc - type galaxies . note that we also find large variations of pitch angles among arms within a spiral galaxy , as well as along individual arms , confirming previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , we find no evidence for a general change in pitch angle with galactocentric distance .",
    "the @xmath1-body simulations of @xcite suggest that the pitch angle of an arm segment decreases with the local rate of shear in a galaxy s rotation , and that shear rate generally increases with radius .",
    "thus , one might expect a small trend of pitch angle decreasing with galactocentric radius .",
    "however , they also find that arm segments are short - lived and change pitch angles by @xmath177 over time scales of @xmath178 gyr .",
    "this may explain the apparent random variation in pitch angles within each galaxy in our sample , since different arm segments would likely be observed at different ages .",
    "the characteristics of pitch angles of milky way spiral arms are now being revealed by trigonometric parallax measurements of high - mass star forming regions from observations with the very long baseline array , the japanese vera project , and the european vlbi network . using parallax results from these arrays yielded pitch angle estimates for sections of the following milky way arms : scutum arm : @xmath179 @xcite , sagittarius arm : @xmath180 @xcite , local arm : @xmath181 @xcite , perseus arm : @xmath182 @xcite , and outer arm : @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "the variation of pitch angle among segments of milky way spiral arms is qualitatively similar to those of the four late - type spirals in this study .",
    "currently the parallax data for the milky way typically trace only arm segments @xmath0 to @xmath184 kpc in length , which corresponds to the scale over which we find relatively constant pitch angles in the external galaxies .",
    "however , as larger regions of the milky way are mapped , one might expect to see pitch angle variations along its spiral arms .",
    "figure [ fig : widths ] shows the widths of arm segments ( defined as the scatter perpendicular to the arm of their  regions ) for the four galaxies in our sample .",
    "only arms with two or more segments are plotted .",
    "except for the three outliers in the lower - right portion of the figure , which indicate narrowing at the ends of some arms ( to be discussed below ) , both individually and as a group these data indicate that spiral arms increase in width with distance from the center of their galaxy .",
    "clear examples of this phenomenon are seen in figure [ fig : ngc628_detailed ] for arm b of  ( ) and in figure [ fig : ngc3184_detailed ] for arm a of .",
    "@xcite reported a similar result for the widths of primary dust lanes associated with spiral arms .",
    "unlike spiral pitch angles that vary significantly and randomly across a galaxy , the widths of arm segments display a systematic variation with radius .",
    "thus , the observed arm - width versus radius trends should provide a clear observable to test and better understand @xmath1-body simulations . at present",
    "we are unaware of arm width estimates from simulations .",
    "a similar analysis by @xcite for milky way spiral arms noted that the scatter in  regions , based on trigonometric parallax distances , increased with distance from the galactic center .",
    "this result motivated us to examine external spiral galaxies to determine if the milky way is typical or unusual in this respect .",
    "although based on this relatively small sample of external galaxies , we conclude that spiral arms widths in the milky way are qualitatively similar to those in other spiral galaxies .",
    "interestingly , in  ( ) arm b ,  arm e , and  ( ) arms a and b , we find that the trend of arm width increasing with distance reverses near the outer tips of these arms .",
    "these last arm segments are all significantly narrower than their immediately interior arm segment .",
    "this narrowing appears related to massive star formation dying out at large galactocentric radii . in classical spiral density - wave theory , this narrowing could be attributed to reaching the radius of co - rotation of a spiral pattern with orbiting material .",
    "if so , s arm a co - rotates at a radius of @xmath185 kpc while arm b co - rotates at a radius of @xmath186 kpc .",
    "the existence of ( at least ) two co - rotation radii in  would argue against a single ( global ) pattern speed , consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the trend of spiral arm width increasing with galactocentric distance demonstrated in this paper may provide a diagnostic characteristic for constraining models of the origin of spiral arms .",
    "the swing amplification mechanism @xcite may lead to such a trend , as swinging inherently fans material outwards @xcite",
    ". whether or not global spiral density - wave theories naturally lead to the observed growth of arm width has not been addressed .    in the galaxies we studied , a small number of spiral arms display nearly continuous arms with modest changes in pitch angle .",
    "however , more commonly , we find the arms are much less regular .",
    "examination of figures 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 reveals that individual arms often break up into segments of @xmath0 kpc length , and different segments join to form bends , kinks , and quasi - linear sections and abrupt changes in pitch angle .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached based on a variety of other observables ( @xcite ) . to these characteristics",
    "we now add variation in arm width .",
    "these observations suggest that spiral arms are not purely global structures .",
    "numerical simulations of galactic disks also show spiral characteristics that indicate non - global origin ( @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations by @xcite show that spiral structures can form in response to perturbations from giant molecular clouds in the disk , which then swing amplify to form arm segments , grow non - linearly , and then connect to produce long spiral - like patterns . given the arm morphologies",
    "we have noted in late - type galaxies , such an origin for spiral arms seems an attractive mechanism .",
