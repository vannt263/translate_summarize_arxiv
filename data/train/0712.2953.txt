    "the constituent quark model has been very successful in describing hadron spectroscopy . in recent years",
    ", some newly observed hadrons attracted much interest from both the experimental and theoretical community since these hadrons do not fit to the quark model predictions @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mass of the observed charm - strange scalar meson @xmath2 @xcite is @xmath3 mev @xcite , while the predictions from most quark models spread from 2400  mev to 2500  mev @xcite .",
    "the high mass predicted in constituent quark models is obtained through an orbital angular momentum excitation . the result from qcd sum rules in heavy quark effective theory gives a mass range @xmath4  gev for the @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) state which is consistent with , but the central value is 100 mev higher than , the experimental value  @xcite . due to the fact that the mass of the @xmath6 is just below the @xmath7 threshold at 2.36  gev ,",
    "a @xmath7 molecular interpretation was proposed by barnes et al .",
    "@xcite and some others  @xcite .",
    "we want to remark that a @xmath7 bound state can be dynamically generated with a mass consistent with the observed mass of the @xmath6 in the framework of the heavy chiral unitary approach  @xcite .",
    "other exotic explanations were also proposed , such as tetraquark state  @xcite , and @xmath8 atom  @xcite . besides these exotic explanations , some authors tried to modify the quark model predictions . in  @xcite , one loop corrections to the spin - dependent one - gluon exchange potential was considered , and the predicted mass of the @xmath2 is higher than the experimental value by only about 20 mev .",
    "another kind of modification is the mixing of the @xmath9 with the @xmath10 tetraquark  @xcite , or considering the coupling of the @xmath9 to hadronic channels , such as @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the prediction for the @xmath2 from the qcd sum rules can also be lowered to @xmath11  gev considering the @xmath7 continuum explicitly  @xcite .",
    "note that it is possible to distinguish a hadronic bound state from elementary hadrons , as done for the deuteron  @xcite and for the light scalars @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "all the results from refs .",
    "@xcite indicate the importance of the strongly coupled hadronic channels on determining the mass of a hadron . for the charm - non - strange sector , both the belle and focus collaborations reported a scalar meson with a large width  @xcite .",
    "although the reported masses by different collaborations are not consistent with each other , the measurements are considered as the same charm scalar meson by the particle data group  ( pdg ) , and the pdg average value of the mass is @xmath14  mev .",
    "the structure of this state has not been clear yet . in this letter",
    ", we revisit the mass shifts of the heavy scalar mesons induced by the strongly coupled hadronic loops . for instance",

    "the coupling constants of the @xmath15 to the three channels can be related by su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "we shall use three different coupling types to study the mass shifts , called model i , ii and iii in the following . in model",
    "i , the coupling of the scalar heavy meson  ( @xmath20 ) to the heavy pseudoscalar meson  ( @xmath21 ) and the goldstone boson  ( @xmath22 ) is assumed to be a constant . in model ii",
    ", the coupling is derived in the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hm@xmath23pt ) which combines the chiral expansion with the heavy quark expansion @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in model iii ,",
    "a chiral effective coupling is constructed disregarding the heavy quark expansion . of course ,",
    "such corrections due to hadronic loops are always model - dependent and are , in general , difficult to quantify , for a recent discussion see @xcite ( for further discussion of incorporating hadronic loops in the quark model , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this is why we consider three different models and also need to assume that for the ground state meson @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , the shift due to the hadronic loops vanishes as it was done e.g. in the calculation of the mass shifts of charmonia in ref .",

    "in general , the effect of a hadronic loop coupling to a bare state is to pull its bare mass down to the physical one ( if the physical mass is above the threshold of the channel , the imaginary part of the loop will contribute to the width of the state ) .",
    "one can expect that the mass of a charm meson can not be pulled down to below the mass of the charm quark @xmath124 .",
    "so we can assume that at some point , called the subtraction point , above @xmath124 , the contribution from any hadronic loop vanishes .",
    "on the other hand , the subtraction point can not be too high since a state close to the threshold of a strong decay channel would have a strong coupling to the channel , and hence its mass would be affected .",
    "a similar idea has been taken to study the mass shifts of charmonia @xcite .",

    "] ] is always positive , and it changes slowly with respect to @xmath128 below 3  gev for the @xmath7 loop , see fig .",
    "[ fig : coe](a ) .",
    "so in model i and iii , the dependence of @xmath33 on the choice of subtraction point is small .",
    "for instance , the values of @xmath33 determined when the subtraction point is chosen at @xmath129  gev and @xmath130  gev are listed in table  [ tab : mu ] .",
    "one can see when the subtraction point is changed from @xmath131 to @xmath124 , the resulting values of @xmath33 in the @xmath7 loop changes slightly , and all the values are not far away from @xmath131 . in the following , we shall take @xmath131 as the subtraction point for model i and iii .",
    "however , in model ii , the coefficient @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath109 , and changes its sign at just below @xmath131 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : coe](b ) , we show @xmath133 as a function of @xmath109 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are used .",
    "so the resulting value of @xmath33 depends strongly on the choice of subtraction point .",
    "the values of @xmath33 in model ii are also given in table  [ tab : mu ] .",
    "it seems that these values are unphysical . because we only take the leading order in heavy quark expansion to describe the coupling in model ii",

    "if we choose a bare mass from another quark model , the obtained mass can even be consistent with the experimental value . in model",
    "i , a constant coupling is taken which would violate goldstone s theorem because the @xmath140 and @xmath141 are goldstone bosons .",
    "model  ii has a large @xmath33 dependence , which makes it not preferable for a phenomenological analysis .",
    "the lagrangian for model  iii is constructed from chiral symmetry , and the @xmath33 dependence is really small ( for instance , the resulting mass of the @xmath2 would change to 2.37 - 2.41  gev if we choose @xmath142  gev as the subtraction point , and the change is no more than 10 mev ) .",
    "therefore , we choose the results in model  iii to give further predictions .",
    "the absolute mass shifts in model  iii are listed in the last column in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 is consistent with the experimental data @xmath14  mev  @xcite .",
    "one strong decay channel @xmath8 is open for the state , and the decay width of this channel should give the dominant contribution to the width of the @xmath0 .",
    "then the width of the @xmath0 can be obtained from @xmath143 using the mass @xmath144 from table  [ tab : results ] , we obtain @xmath145 the result is roughly consistent with the experimental width for the @xmath0 , which was reported as @xmath146  mev by the belle collaboration  @xcite and @xmath147  mev by the focus collaboration  @xcite . both the mass and the width suggest the observed @xmath0 state can be the dressed @xmath53 state .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , two molecular states were predicted , and both of them are not consistent with the data .",
    "certainly , the uncertainty of the data is large so far , and more precise measurements are highly desirable .",
    "another noticeable result is that the mass shifts in the bottom sector are about twice of those in the charm sector , as can be seen from the last column in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "based on heavy quark symmetry , and assuming the @xmath50 is a @xmath7 bound state , the mass of the @xmath148 bound state was predicted as 5733  mev  @xcite which was confirmed by a dynamical calculation  @xcite , larger than the mass region obtained here by dressing the @xmath54 state .",
    "that means if a @xmath149 state with a mass which is much smaller than 5733  mev were found , it would probably be a dressed @xmath150 state rather than a @xmath148 bound state , or the @xmath50 would not be a @xmath7 bound state .",
    "similar to that of the @xmath0 , the width of the @xmath151 can be estimated as @xmath152",
    "the @xmath50 is considered as a @xmath7 molecular state by many authors because in the quark model its mass simply comes out too high .",
    "however , hadronic loops can pull down its mass . to make the calculation of such an effect quantitative , we assume that the hadronic - loop induced mass shifts of a hadron vanish at some point . the point is chosen as @xmath153 for the charm sector and @xmath154 for the bottom sector .",
    "then we calculate the mass shifts of the heavy scalar mesons by using three different types of coupling .",
    "the input bare masses are taken from the godfrey - isgur quark model  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath2 state is lowered significantly , and it can even be pulled down to 2317 mev if we adjust the bare mass in the predicted region from different quark models .",
    "that means the simple argument against the quark model for too high masses is not valid .",
    "what the quark model predicts is just the bare masses of hadrons . in order to compare with the experimental spectroscopy ,",
    "the bare hadron masses need to be dressed  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that such a dressing is always model - dependent and must be considered in different approaches , as done here . because chiral symmetry is fulfilled and the @xmath33 dependence is small , we choose model  iii to give further predictions .",
    "the results of both mass and width show that the observed @xmath155 could be a dressed @xmath1 state .",
    "we also give predictions for the dressed bottom scalar mesons .",
    "the mass of the @xmath149 is smaller than that of the @xmath148 bound state which was obtained assuming the @xmath50 be a @xmath7 bound state  @xcite .",
    "precise experimental data from @xmath156 factories are highly desirable to test the dressing mechanism .",
    "we would like to stress that a consistent treatment of the mass and width is required .",
    "the difference from the molecular state will presumably be revealed in the decay pattern with into various channels , this is a further step to be investigated .",
