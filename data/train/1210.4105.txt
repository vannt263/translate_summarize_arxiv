    "hybrid inflation @xcite is an attractive mechanism for generating the cosmological density perturbations .",
    "it is naturally realized in the framework of grand unified theories ( guts ) and string theories , especially in the form of d - term inflation @xcite where the gut scale emerges via the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term of an anomalous @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "a further important virtue of d - term inflation is that tree - level supergravity corrections to the inflaton mass of order the hubble parameter are absent .",
    "d - term inflation has been quantitatively analyzed for the canonical khler potential as well as for some non - minimal khler potentials @xcite .",
    "the value of the inflaton field is typically @xmath3 and supergravity corrections are therefore important .",
    "in addition to the primordial fluctuations of the inflaton field , the cosmic microwave background is significantly affected by the production of cosmic strings at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "generically , it appears difficult to obtain agreement with observational data @xcite . in particular the scalar spectral index",
    "@xmath4 turns out to be rather large and the gauge coupling is constrained to small values , in conflict with the motivation of implementing d - term hybrid inflation in guts .    in this paper",
    "we study d - term inflation in the context of superconformal supergravity models @xcite which have recently been considered in connection with higgs inflation @xcite .",
    "these models are motivated by the underlying superconformal symmetry of supergravity , and have several intriguing features .",
    "in particular , there is a jordan frame in which the matter part of the lagrangian takes a particularly simple form , closely resembling global supersymmetry . in the einstein frame ,",
    "supergravity corrections to scalar masses are suppressed by powers of @xmath5 , and , contrary to canonical supergravity , the scalar potential does not contain factors which grow exponentially at large field values .",
    "the superconformal symmetry is broken by fixing the value of the conformal compensator field , which generates the kinetic term of the graviton @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , a fayet - iliopoulos term can be introduced analogously . a further explicit",
    "breaking of superconformal symmetry is a holomorphic contribution to the khler potential @xcite .",
    "this turns d - term inflation into a two - field inflation model .    as we have recently shown , the spontaneous breaking of @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 , the difference of baryon and lepton number , at the gut scale can explain the initial conditions of the hot early universe including baryogenesis and dark matter @xcite .",
    "this analysis was carried out assuming f - term hybrid inflation .",
    "as we shall see , f - term hybrid inflation is inconsistent with superconformal symmetry . on the contrary",
    ", d - term inflation can be implemented with superconformal symmetry and can also incorporate spontaneous @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 breaking at the gut scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_superconformal_inflation ]",
    "we review the most important features of superconformal models of inflation and in particular discuss the resulting scalar potentials for f- and d - term hybrid inflation . section  [ sec_single_field ] deals with an important special case , namely a single - field scenario which arises if inflation lasted sufficiently long before the onset of the final 50 e - folds .",
    "the full two - field inflation model is discussed in section  [ sec_two - field ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "an attractive class of supergravity models can be defined by requiring the matter sector and its couplings to supergravity to be invariant under superconformal transformations . the superconformal symmetry is explicitly broken only by the pure supergravity part of the action and the superconformal anomaly .",
    "matter interactions at energies below the planck mass then obey the superconformal symmetry up to corrections suppressed by inverse powers of the planck mass and radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "for these theories there exists a jordan frame in which the lagrangian takes a remarkably simple form which closely resembles globally supersymmetric theories . the bosonic part for metric and scalar fields @xmath9",

    "since for negative @xmath73 the scalar potential indeed becomes steeper the further one moves along the @xmath225 contour towards the @xmath111-axis , this explains our observation in fig .",

    "[ fig_cobe_strings ] : small @xmath72 values yield a large spectral index , while larger @xmath72 values give smaller @xmath4 values .",

    "this illustrates that our model is in principle capable of generating a spectral index of the right magnitude , while simultaneously providing the correct amplitude of the scalar power spectrum .",
    "an obvious problem , however , is that in order to reproduce the observed amplitude @xmath233 , we require quite large @xmath51 values , such that the cosmic string tension becomes unpleasantly large .",
    "considering trajectories different to the @xmath110-axis , i.e. , different to the trajectory studied in section  [ sec_single_field ] , sharpens the tension imposed by the cosmic string bound , since the decrease in the amplitude due to the motion in @xmath111-direction forces us to go to even larger values of @xmath51 and hence larger values of @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , we note that among the viable values for @xmath4 for a given value of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the spectral index comes out smaller the closer to the @xmath110-axis the corresponding inflationary trajectory is . in a universe undergoing a sufficiently long period of inflation",
    ", it may however not require much fine - tuning to end up with an inflationary trajectory running close to the @xmath110-axis during the last @xmath127 e - folds of inflation , cf .  the comment below eq .   in section  [ subsec_slowrolleom ] .",
    "superconformal symmetry is an underlying symmetry of supergravity , broken only by fixing the value of the conformal compensator field , which generates the kinetic term of the gravitational field .",
    "it can also serve as a guideline for coupling matter fields to supergravity .",
    "the resulting supergravity models have several intriguing features .",
    "there is a jordan frame where the lagrangian takes a particularly simple form , closely resembling global supersymmetry .",
    "furthermore , contrary to canonical supergravity , the scalar potential does not contain factors which grow exponentially at large field values , which keeps supergravity corrections to scalar masses under control .",
    "as we have seen , a fayet - iliopoulos term can be introduced analogously to the kinetic term of the graviton by making use of the conformal compensator field .    in this paper , we study hybrid models of inflation with superconformal symmetry . as we show , the inflaton acquires a large tachyonic mass in f - term hybrid inflation , which therefore is not viable . on the contrary ,",
    "d - term hybrid inflation is consistent with superconformal symmetry . allowing for an explicit symmetry breaking by a holomorphic contribution to the khler potential involving only dimensionless parameters @xcite , one obtains a two - field inflation model . if inflation lasted sufficiently long before the onset of the last 50 e - folds , the inflationary trajectory along the real part of the complex inflaton field becomes an attractor . for this limiting case",
    "we obtain analytic formulas for the amplitude of scalar fluctuations and the spectral index , which describe the full numerical results very well .",
    "it turns out that the spectral index can become as small as @xmath0 . for generic two - field trajectories , we calculate the resulting amplitude of the primordial power spectrum and the spectral index numerically .    comparing the obtained results with current cmb data , we find that for values of the gauge coupling compatible with guts and after fixing the overall normalization of the primordial power spectrum to the observed value , we can identify three different regions of the parameter space . for large values of the superpotential coupling @xmath72 , we obtain a spectral index close to the current best - fit value , @xmath196",
    ". however , in this regime the model is at variance with current bounds on the cosmic string tension . on the other hand , for small values of @xmath72 , the cosmic string bound",
    "can easily be fulfilled , at the price of a 2.4@xmath110 deviation from the best - fit value for the spectral index . in the intermediate regime , the correct spectral index within 2@xmath110 experimental uncertainty can be achieved while simultaneously fulfilling the cosmic string bound .",
    "summarizing , superconformal d - term inflation can successfully account for the primordial power spectrum , with values of the spectral index down to @xmath0 , depending on the inflationary trajectory .",
    "generically , however , there is a tension with the cosmic string bound .",
    "this might be improved by considering a more strongly coupled theory or by considering an embedding of the simple model of d - term inflation described here into a more complete setup containing additional fields , which could yield further contributions to the primordial power spectrum .",
    "it should also be noted that the bound on the cosmic string tension contains considerable theoretical uncertainties ; a better understanding of the related phenomena is necessary before parameter regions in conflict with this bound can be ruled out with certainty .    *",
