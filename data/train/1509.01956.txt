    "complete synchronization and phase synchronization between two continuous variable ( cv ) quantum systems were first studied by @xcite in mesoscopic optomechanical systems @xcite , and they also made the forward - looking prediction that the quantum synchronization is of potential but important applications in quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "subsequently , quantum synchronization is deeply discussed in variety of quantum systems , such as cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , van der pol ( vdp ) oscillators @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite , superconducting circuit system @xcite , and so on . in these works ,",
    "quantum synchronization is further extended from cv system to finite dimensional hilbert space corresponding to more excellent quantum properties and the quantum correlation is also analyzed quantificationally in those synchronous quantum system @xcite .",
    "in addition , quantum synchronization criteria @xcite and synchronization between nodes in quantum network are still hot topics in the field of quantum synchronization theory .",
    "generally , existing quantum synchronization schemes can be attributed to the concept of coupling synchronization , i.e. , one subsystem of the synchronous systems plays the role of controller acting on the other subsystem @xcite .",
    "a significant advantage of this kind of direct linking is its high maneuverability .",
    "however , it still remains some difficulties to achieve the better applications in qip with quantum synchronization .",
    "for the weak coupling of the quantum level , it is difficult to eliminate the difference between systems if it is big enough , and in fact , it is often in this case .",
    "fundamentally , too strong driving or pump fields will compel systems to the form of the forced synchronization , just like what they are realized in previous works @xcite .",
    "this deficiency of coupling synchronization is a severe limitation , which causes other types of synchronizations are hardly realized in addition to complete and phase synchronizations . for examples , antiphase synchronization and projective synchronization , which are also widely applied in the classical synchronization fields @xcite ,",
    "were rarely discussed in quantum systems .    in traditional control theory , besides the coupling terms , there exists an external controller which is imposed on response system in order to provide a more outstanding control capability , implying that a designed controller can establish a more flexible relationship between two controlled subsystems @xcite .",
    "it enlightens us to think about such problems : can a more generalized synchronization ( like above mentioned antiphase and projective synchronizations ) be extended and obtained in quantum domain ? if it works , what kinds of the criterion and measurement are needed in this quantum generalized synchronization ? and most importantly , how are the controllers designed in order to satisfy various requirements corresponding to different kinds of generalized synchronizations ?    for responsing above questions , in this paper",
    ", we study the general properties of different synchronization forms and expand them into quantum mechanics based on mari s complete synchronization theory .",
    "the criterion and measurement of the generalized synchronization are also proposed and they will be divided into two orders for calculating and analyzing conveniently . instead of directly establishing interaction between two subsystems , here we utilize lyapunov control theory which has exhibited comprehensive applications in target quantum state preparation and suppressing decoherence to design the external controller @xcite .",
    "although the lyapunov function is constituted by expectation values , our results show that the quantum fluctuations can also be effectively subdued by the controller .",
    "in addition , the classical and quantum correlations are considered via calculating the lyapunov exponent and gaussian negativity . in particular",
    ", we demonstrate that cv entanglement can exist in generalized synchronization , however , it will disappear if generalized synchronization tends to complete synchronization .",
    "this phenomenon is consistent with mari s and ameri s conclusions about entanglement in complete synchronization @xcite .",

    "so , designers can complete different synchronizations according to their requirements based on our theory . for making our theory",
    "more intuitive , we have considered two common generalized synchronization , that is , so  called constant error synchronization and time delay synchronization in an optomechanical system . with the help of control fields designed by lyapunov function , we have proved two oscillators",
    "can satisfy the requirements of various synchronizations .",
    "we believe that our work can bring certain application values in quantum information transmission , quantum control , and quantum logical processing .",

    "<S> the generalized synchronization can be considered as a necessary condition or a more flexible derivative of complete synchronization , and its criterion and synchronization measurement are further proposed and analyzed in this paper . as an example , we consider two typical generalized synchronizations in a designed optomechanical system . unlike the effort to construct a special coupling synchronization system , we purposefully design extra control fields based on lyapunov control theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lyapunov function can adapt to more flexible control objectives , which is more suitable for generalized synchronization control , and the control fields can be achieved simply with a time - variant voltage . finally , the existence of quantum entanglement in different generalized synchronizations is also discussed . </S>"
