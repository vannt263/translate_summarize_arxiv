    "the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has remained elusive for three decades . with their cosmological origin firmly established , the challenge now lies in identifying the grb progenitors .",

    "these models can be constrained by the observed temporal evolution and spectral properties of the grb afterglow .",
    "the study of grb afterglow light curves has shown that they are usually characterized by a power - law decay , @xmath5 , as predicted in the generic `` fireball '' model  in which the kinetic energy of ultra - relativisitc particles is converted to photons from a spatially small region ( piran 1999 ) .",
    "a number of afterglows have been observed to decay at a very rapid rate .",
    "the decay rate , @xmath6 , depends on the nature of the fireball and also on the density structure of the ambient medium .",
    "there are currently two generic afterglow scenarios that result in steep light curves ; the jet - model ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ) in which the relativistic outflow is collimated , and the wind model ( chevalier & li 1999 ) which invokes an inhomogeneous circumburst medium . in a few cases",
    "the rate of decay has been observed to steepen , resulting in a ` break ' in the light curve , which is most naturally accounted for by a collimated outflow .",

    "the first nfi observation was made prior to the time of our estimated break , while the remaining nfi observations were made after the break .",
    "consequently , the pre - break value of @xmath34 can be estimated as the slope between the wfc and the first nfi measurement , giving approximately @xmath35 .",

    "is then characterized by four power - law sections separated by three breaks at @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 corresponding to the synchrotron self - absorption , peak energy and cooling frequencies , respectively ( sari et  al . 1998 ) .",
    "an optical broad - band spectrum coinciding in time with the first bepposax nfi observation ( nicastro 1998 ) was constructed by interpolating ( or mildly extrapolating ) the flux in each band to a common date of may 19.96 ut .    unfortunately , the reddening towards grb  980519 , @xmath42 , is uncertain .",
    "the estimate of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) for this region is e(b@xmath43v ) @xmath44 , but & goodman ( 1999 ) argue that these reddening values are overestimated when @xmath45 ( which is the case here ) .",
    "since a small error in e(b@xmath43v ) translates into a large uncertainty in the inferred spectral slope , @xmath46 , we refrain from estimating it directly from the broad - band spectrum . instead , based on our data , we note that @xmath46 can be expressed as a linear function of the reddening as @xmath47e(b@xmath43v)@xmath48 .",

    "it is readily seen from both the uncorrected and extinction corrected optical data in fig .",

    "the steep initial temporal evolution of grb  980519 and a spectral break between optical and x - ray suggests emission by adiabatic electrons ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "when the emitting electrons are adiabatic , it follows that the initial temporal evolution of the light - curve ( whether the outflow is spherical or collimated ) is given by @xmath53 , with the ambient density profile of the form @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) ( mszros , rees , & wijers 1998 ; panaitescu , mszros , & rees 1998 ) .",
    "here , @xmath56 , represents a stellar wind density distribution , while @xmath57 represents a homogeneous density distribution .",
    "the temporal decay slope is thus steeper by @xmath58 in the inhomogeneous case .",
    "if the ejecta is collimated , and the observer is within the collimated jet , the light curve is given by the above expression while there still is considerable relativistic beaming , i.e.  while @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the bulk lorentz - factor and @xmath61 is the half angle of the collimated outflow .",
    "when the expansion slows down and @xmath60 drops below @xmath62 , the observer starts to see the edge of the jet and the light curve behavior switches to @xmath63 the light curve thus steepens by @xmath64 ) .",
    "an inhomogeneous environment therefore leads to a steeper light curve but a less pronounced break than in the homogeneous case .",
    "specifically , a collimated outflow expanding into a circumstellar wind environment with @xmath56 , would steepen by @xmath65 , whereas the steepening in a homogeneous environment would be @xmath66 .    in the case of grb  980519 the existence of a temporal break",
    "is most naturally explained if the outflow was collimated .",
    "the steepening in the light curve is measured to be @xmath67 which implies an environmental density gradient of @xmath68 , in excellent agreement with the distribution expected from a circumstellar wind .",
    "the expected optical spectral index can be inferred from the light curve as @xmath69 .",
    "the relation between reddening due to galactic extinction and @xmath46 given in section  [ sec : specprop ] can then be used to infer e(b@xmath43v ) @xmath49 from the expected optical spectral index .",
    "this is the value used for the galactic extinction correction of the optical data in fig .",
    "[ fig : broadbandspec ] and is in good agreement with the value estimated from schlegel et  al .",
    "the power - law index of the electron energy distribution is @xmath70 ( for @xmath71 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) , @xmath74 , and that of ( 1998 ) , @xmath75 .",
    "in the collapsar scenario the gamma - ray burst and its afterglow are believed to be produced by a collapsing massive star ( e.g. , a wolf  rayet star ) leading to a collimated ultra - relativistic outflow .",
    "the jet would then interact with an inhomogeneous density distribution created by a preexisting stellar wind expelled by the progenitor star ( fryer , woosley , & hartmann 1999 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "the identification of a spectral break between optical and x - rays , suggesting a fast cooling regime ( @xmath73 ) at x - ray frequencies , implies that the x - ray decay slope is shallower by @xmath76 as compared to the optical ( slow cooling ) ( chevalier & li 1999 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the temporal x - ray decay discussed in section  [ sec : lightcurve ] .",
    "the radio data presented by frail et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) also appears to be consistent with the presented collapsar scenario .",
    "the collapsar model can thus account for the x - ray , optical and radio observations of grb  980519 .",
    "a potential problem for this interpretation concerns the sharpness of the observed break .",
    "the break in the light curve of grb  980519 is rather sharply defined in time and occurred on a timescale of about 0.2 days .",
    "this is much shorter than expected from theoretical models . ,",
    "sikora , & bulik ( 2000 ) showed that the transition of the light curve from one asymptote to the other occurs within a factor of two in time for a jet of constant opening angle in a constant density environment .",
    "if the opening angle of the collimated outflow is allowed to evolve , the break becomes even smoother , i.e. , extends over a longer period of time .",
    "based on numerical simulations , kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) argue that the transition in such cases takes place over a factor of at least 100 in time in a wind density environment .",
    "much shorter break time scales , however , are expected for observers located on the jet axis .    in the collapsar scenario",
    "a re - brightening of the source @xmath77 days after the burst is expected due to the onset of a supernova type ibc explosion as energy is deposited by the jet ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",

    "alternatively , should the redshift of grb  980519 turn out to be lower than @xmath79 , the absence of a sn signature in the data ( see fig .  [",

    "<S> we present extensive multi - colour ( @xmath0 ) photometry of the optical afterglow of grb  980519 . upon discovery , 8.3  hours after the burst , </S>",

    "<S> , we argue that the rapid initial decline , the ` break ' in the light curve , and the spectral properties of the afterglow are best interpreted as being due to a collimated ultra - relativistic jet of fixed opening angle expanding into an inhomogeneous medium . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the circumburst medium has a density structure that goes as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is characteristic of a preexisting wind expelled from a massive star . </S>",

    "<S> however , the supernova signature expected in the light curve in such a scenario is not detected . </S>",
    "<S> this either implies that the redshift of grb  980519 is greater than 1.5 or that supernovae accompanying grbs are not standard candles . </S>"
