    "vladimir arnold s 1966 seminal paper @xcite in which he introduced numerous geometric ideas into hydrodynamics influenced the field far beyond its original scope .",
    "one of arnold s remarkable and , in my opinion , very unexpected insights was to regard the fluid vorticity field ( or the vorticity 2-form ) as an element of the dual to the lie algebra of the fluid velocities , i.e. , the algebra of divergence - free vector fields on the flow domain .",
    "in this paper , after a review of the concept of isovorticed fields , which was crucial , e.g. , in arnold s stability criterion in fluid dynamics , we present an  avatar \" of this concept , providing a natural framework for the formalism of vortex membranes and vortex sheets . in particular ,",
    "we present the equation of localized induction approximation , which turns out to be the skew - mean - curvature flow in any dimension .",
    "we also show that the space of vortex sheets has a natural symplectic structure and occupies an intermediate position between vortex filaments in 3d ( or point vortices in 2d ) equipped with the marsden - weinstein symplectic structure on the one hand and smooth vorticity fields with the lie - poisson structure on them on the other hand .    before launching into hydrodynamical formalism in this memorial paper",
    ", i would like to recall an episode with vladimir igorevich , related not to fluid dynamics , but rather to his equally surprising insights in real life : his remarks were always witty , to the point , and often mischievous .    back in 1986 arnold became a corresponding member of the soviet academy of sciences .",
    "this was the time of  glasnost \" and  acceleration \" : novels of many formerly forbidden authors appeared in print for the first time .",
    "jacques chirac , prime minister of france at the time , visited moscow and gave a speech in front of the soviet academy in the spring of 1986 .",
    "the speech was typeset beforehand and distributed to the academy members .",
    "arnold was meeting us , a group of his students , right after chirac s speech and brought us that printout .",
    "chirac , who knows russian , mentioned almost every disgraced poet or writer of the soviet russia in his speech : it contained citations from gumilev , akhmatova , mandelshtam , pasternak ... and on the top of this printout , above the speech , was the following epigraph in arnold s unmistakable handwriting :    [ multiblock footnote omitted ]    who could take this speech seriously after such a tongue - in - cheek epigraph ? as a curious aftermath , arnold and chirac shared the russia state prize in 2007 .",
    "returning to mathematics , i think that the ideas introduced by arnold in @xcite , so natural in retrospect , are in fact most surprising given the state of the art in hydrodynamics of the mid-60s both for their deep insight into the nature of fluids and their geometric elegance and simplicity . in the next section",
    "we begin with a brief survey of the use of vorticity in a few hydrodynamical applications and discuss how it helps in understanding the properties of vortex filaments and vortex sheets .",
    "consider the euler equation for an inviscid incompressible fluid filling a riemannian manifold @xmath2 ( possibly with boundary ) . the fluid motion is described as an evolution of the fluid velocity field @xmath3 in @xmath2 which is governed by the classical euler equation : @xmath4 here the field @xmath3",
    "is assumed to be divergence - free ( @xmath5 ) with respect to the riemannian volume form @xmath6 and tangent to the boundary of @xmath2 .",
    "the pressure function @xmath7 is defined uniquely modulo an additive constant by these restrictions on the velocity @xmath3 . the term @xmath8 stands for the riemannian covariant derivative @xmath9 of the field @xmath3 in the direction of itself .",
    "the vorticity ( or helmholtz ) form of the euler equation is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lie derivative along the field @xmath3 and which means that the vorticity field @xmath12 is transported by ( or  frozen into \" ) the fluid flow . in 3d",
    "the vorticity field @xmath13 can be thought of as a vector field , while in 2d it is a scalar vorticity function . in the standard 2d - space with",
    "coordinates @xmath14 the vorticity function is curl  @xmath15 , which can be viewed as the vertical coordinate of the vorticity vector field for the 2d plane - parallel flow in 3d . the fact that the vorticity is  frozen into \" the flow allows one to define various invariants of the hydrodynamical euler equation , e.g. , the conservation of helicity in 3d and enstrophies in 2d .",
    "the euler equation has the following hamiltonian formulation .",
    "for an @xmath16-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath2 with a volume form @xmath6 consider the lie group @xmath17 of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding lie algebra @xmath18 consists of smooth divergence - free vector fields in @xmath2 tangent to the boundary @xmath19 : @xmath20 the natural  regular dual \" space for this lie algebra is the space of cosets of smooth 1-forms on @xmath2 modulo exact 1-forms , @xmath21 , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "vorticity 2-form _ @xmath34 is the differential of the 1-form @xmath29 .",
    "note that in 3d the vorticity vector field @xmath35 is defined by the 2-form @xmath13 via @xmath36 for the volume form @xmath6 . in 2d",
    "@xmath35 is the function @xmath37 .",
    "the definition of vorticity @xmath13 as an exact 2-form in @xmath2 makes sense for any dimension of the manifold @xmath2 .",
    "this point of view can be traced back to the original papers by arnold , see e.g. @xcite    such a definition immediately implies that :    @xmath38 the vorticity 2-form @xmath39 is well - defined for cosets @xmath22 $ ] : 1-forms @xmath23 in the same coset have equal vorticities , and    @xmath40 the euler equation in the form ( [ idealvorticity ] ) or @xmath41 means that the vorticity 2-form @xmath42 is transported by ( or frozen into ) the fluid flow in _ any _ dimension .",
    "the latter allows one to define generalized enstrophies for all even - dimensional flows and helicity - type integrals for all odd - dimensional ideal fluid flows , which turn out to be first integrals of the corresponding higher - dimensional euler equation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this geometric setting can be rigorously developed within the sobolev framework for @xmath43 diffeomorphisms and vector fields on @xmath2 for sufficiently large @xmath44 , see @xcite . to present the geometric ideas and include singular vorticities we keep things formal in what follows .",
    "this point of view on vorticity was the basis for arnold s stability criterion .",
    "namely , steady fluid flows are critical points of the restriction of the hamiltonian ( which is the kinetic energy function defined on the dual space ) to the spaces of isovorticed fields , i.e. sets of fields with diffeomorphic vorticities . if the restriction of the hamiltonian functional has a sign - definite ( positive or negative ) second variation at the critical point , the corresponding steady flow is lyapunov stable .",
    "this is famous arnold s stability test . in particular , he proved ( see e.g. @xcite ) that shear flows in an annulus with no inflection points in the velocity profile are lyapunov stable , thus generalizing the rayleigh stability condition .",
    "another consequence of such a point of view on vorticity , which is of the main interest to us , is the existence of the poisson structure .",
    "let @xmath2 be an @xmath16-dimensional riemannian manifold with a volume form @xmath6 and filled with an incompressible fluid . as we discussed above",
    ", the vorticity of a fluid motion geometrically is the 2-form defined by @xmath45 , where @xmath31 is the 1-form obtained from the vector field @xmath3 by the metric lifting of indices .",
    "assume that @xmath46 to simplify the reasoning below .",
    "then the space of vorticities @xmath47 , i.e. the space of exact 2-forms @xmath48 , coincides with the dual space to the lie algebra @xmath49 of divergence - free vector fields .",
    "indeed , @xmath50 where the latter identification holds since @xmath46 .    as the dual space to a lie algebra , the space of vorticities @xmath51 has the natural lie - poisson structure .",
    "its symplectic leaves are coadjoint orbits of the corresponding group @xmath52 . here",
    "such orbits are sets of fields with diffeomorphic vorticities on @xmath2 , with the group action being the action of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms on vorticity 2-forms .",
    "the euler equation defines a hamiltonian evolution on these orbits .",
    "the corresponding ( kirillov - kostant ) symplectic structure on orbits in @xmath53 is given by the following formula .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath27 be two divergence - free vector fields in @xmath2 , which we regard as a pair of variations of the point @xmath13 in @xmath53 .",
    "the _ kirillov - kostant symplectic structure _ on coadjoint orbits associates to a pair of such variations tangent to the coadjoint orbit of the vorticity @xmath13 the following quantity : @xmath55 \\rangle   = \\langle \\eta , ~[v , w ] \\rangle = \\int_{m } \\eta \\wedge i_{[v , w ] } \\mu=\\int_m \\xi \\wedge i_vi_w\\mu\\ , .\\ ] ] here the 1-form @xmath56 is a primitive of the vorticity 2-form @xmath13 , and @xmath57 $ ] is the commutator of the vector fields @xmath54 and @xmath27 in @xmath2 .",
    "note that for divergence - free vector fields @xmath54 and @xmath27 their commutator satisfies the identity @xmath58}\\mu = d(i_vi_w\\mu)$ ] , which implies the last equality in ( [ kk ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this paper we deal with singular vorticities .",
    "regular vorticities have support of full dimension , i.e. of codimension 0 in @xmath2 , while singular ones have support of codim  @xmath59 .",
    "singular vorticities form a subspace in ( a completion of ) the dual space @xmath60 .",
    "note that since vorticity is a ( possibly singular ) 2-form ( more precisely , a current of degree 2 ) , its support has to be of codim  @xmath61 .",
    "( e.g. , if support is of codim  @xmath62 , it corresponds to a singular 3-form .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details on currents . )",
    "the most interesting cases of support are of codimension 1 ( vortex sheets ) and codimension 2 ( point vortices in 2d , vortex filaments in 3d and vortex membranes , or higher filaments , for any dimension ) . in the next sections we start with the codimension 2 case , and deal with the codimension 1 case towards the end of the paper .",
    "the main types of singular vorticities , as well as related to them symplectic structures and hamiltonian equations studied below , are summarized in the table above .",
    "while the goal of this paper is partially expository , and various facts on vortex filament dynamics are scattered in the extensive literature , certain results presented below ( in particular , the hamiltonian framework for vortex sheets , the skew - mean - curvature flows and the lia in any dimension ) are apparently new .",
    "let @xmath2 be the 2-dimensional euclidean plane @xmath63 .",
    "let the 2d vorticity @xmath13 be supported on @xmath64 point vortices : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are coordinates of the @xmath67th point vortex in @xmath68 with the standard area form @xmath69 .",
    "kirchhoff s theorem states that the evolution of vortices according to the euler equation is described by the system @xmath70 this is a hamiltonian system in @xmath71 with the hamiltonian function @xmath72 and the poisson structure is given by the bracket @xmath73    one can derive the above hamiltonian dynamics from the 2d euler equation in the vorticity form @xmath74 where @xmath13 is a vorticity function in @xmath63 and the stream function ( or hamiltonian ) @xmath75 of the flow satisfies @xmath76 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "while the system ( [ kirch ] ) goes back to kirchhoff , its properties for various numbers of point vortices and versions for different manifolds have been of constant interest , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the cases of @xmath77 and @xmath78 point vortices are integrable , while those of @xmath79 are not",
    ". the subtle issue of in what sense the equation of @xmath64 point vortices approximates the 2d euler equation as @xmath80 is treated , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the origin of the poisson bracket ( [ poissonvortices ] ) is explained by the following    ( @xcite ) the poisson bracket ( [ poissonvortices ] ) is defined by the kirillov - kostant symplectic structure on the coadjoint orbit of the ( singular ) vorticity @xmath81 in ( the completion of ) the dual of the lie algebra @xmath82 of divergence free vector fields in @xmath63 .    indeed ,",
    "a vector tangent to the coadjoint orbit of such a singular vorticity @xmath83 can be regarded as a collection of vectors @xmath84 in @xmath63 attached at points @xmath85 .",
    "then for a pair of tangent vectors the corresponding kirillov - kostant symplectic structure becomes the weighted sum of the corresponding contributions at each point vortex @xmath85 with strengths @xmath86 as the corresponding weights : @xmath87 the poisson bracket ( [ poissonvortices ] ) , being the inverse of the symplectic structure , has the reciprocals of the weights @xmath86 .      by passing from 2d to",
    "3d we move from point vortices to filaments .",
    "vortex filaments are curves in @xmath1 being supports of singular vorticity fields .",
    "they are governed by the euler equation @xmath88 where @xmath89 and the vorticity field ( or a 2-form ) @xmath13 has support on a curve @xmath90 .",
    "( note that the exactness of the form @xmath13 implies that @xmath91 is a boundary of a 2-dimensional domain , i.e. , in particular , its components are either closed or go to infinity . )",
    "the euler dynamics is nonlocal in terms of the vorticity field , or 2-form , @xmath13 since it requires finding the field @xmath89 .",
    "the localized induction approximation ( lia ) of the vorticity motion is a procedure which allows one to keep only the local terms in the vorticity euler equation , as we discuss below . in @xmath1 the corresponding evolution",
    "is described by the _ vortex filament equation _",

    "assume that the velocity distribution @xmath3 in @xmath1 has vorticity @xmath100 concentrated on a smooth embedded arc - length parametrized curve @xmath90 of length @xmath101 .",
