    "the discovery of remarkable correlations between the masses of supermassive bhs hosted at the centers of galaxies and the global properties of the parent galaxies themselves  @xcite leads to a natural link between the cosmological evolution of qsos and the formation history of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of such interesting correlations looks promising not only to better understand how and when galaxies formed , but also to obtain information on the qso population itself  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on two specific points raised by the general remarks above : 1 ) the use of the `` magorrian relation '' to determine the qso duty cycle at redshift @xmath1 ; 2 ) the expected relation between the cosmological evolution of the total luminosity emitted by star  forming galaxies and that of the total luminosity emitted by qsos .",
    "as we will see , an interesting consequence of this last point is the possible existence of a physical process limiting gas accretion onto bhs at high redshifts .",
    "observational _ inputs of our analysis are the magorrian relation  @xcite , the galaxy mass  to  light ratio ( from the fundamental plane )  @xcite , the present - day luminosity function of spheroids  @xcite , the present - day and the integrated qso cosmological ( light ) evolution  @xcite , and finally the star formation history  @xcite .",
    "a possible alternative to the use of the mass - to - light ratio is the use of the faber - jackson  @xcite relation coupled with the so - called @xmath2 relation  @xcite .",
    "the technical details will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we start our analysis by deriving the qso s mean accretion efficiency associated with the bh s growth ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the present - day total mass of bhs at the center of stellar spheroids , and @xmath5 is the total energy emitted by all qsos over the entire life of the universe .",
    "we then derive the qso ( mean ) duty cycle @xmath6 in two ways : @xmath7 \\over\\nq[\\lq(x,0)]},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is such that qsos brighter than @xmath8 ( whose number is @xmath9 $ ] ) emit the fraction @xmath10 of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is such that all bhs heavier than @xmath12 ( whose number is @xmath13 $ ] ) sum up to @xmath14 ( at z=0 ) .",
    "we found that the two ways give consistently @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in good agreement with theoretical results  @xcite .",
    "our result is similar in spirit but different in detail from that derived in  @xcite , who obtained a _ qso lifetime _ of @xmath17 yr at a hubble epoch of @xmath18 yr or , in our terms , @xmath19 .",
    "finally , an interesting expectation based on the magorrian relation would be a parallel evolution of the qso accretion and star formation histories .",
    "as is well known , at @xmath20 the qso total luminosity and the uv luminosity associated to the star formation history are indeed roughly parallel but at @xmath21 they have clearly divergent slopes .",
    "a fit shows that the qso luminosity evolution is reasonably well fitted under the assumptions that bhs are accreting at _ one tenth _ of the eddington luminosity , as computed under the standard assumption of pure electron scattering . a global picture",
    "could then be that at low redshift the bh accretion ( and star formation ) are limited by the available amount of gas , while at high redshift some extra source of opacity ( as for example bremsstrahlung opacity  @xcite ) , able to reduce the eddington luminosity of one order of magnitude ( with respect to the pure electron scattering case ) , is at work  @xcite ."

    "<S> we present a robust method to derive the duty cycle of qso activity based on the empirical qso luminosity function and on the present - day linear relation between the masses of supermassive black holes and those of their spheroidal host stellar systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the duty cycle is substantially less than unity , with characteristic values in the range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we tested the expectation that the qso luminosity evolution and the star formation history should be roughly parallel , as a consequence of the above  mentioned relation between bh and galaxy masses . </S>"
