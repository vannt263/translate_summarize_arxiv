    "such an understanding could provide further insight into fundamental behaviors of systems with orientational order , such as liquid crystals , or systems subjected to external fields and anisotropic flows @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , there has been only one study that combined video microscopy with particle tracking to measure the rotational motion of colloidal clusters  @xcite , using different methods than described in this work .",
    "that study focused on dilute systems of planar clusters undergoing two - dimensional diffusion near a boundary , and revealed a decoupling of translational and rotational diffusion due to hydrodynamic effects .",

    ", we simulate the motion of colloidal clusters under conditions that are relevant to common microscopy experiments .",
    "we then use our method to measure the rotational diffusion coefficient of a real colloidal cluster , and compare the results of both simulations and experiments to other methods of measuring rotational diffusion .",
    "our procedure for calculating rotational displacements of clusters is based on a method by challis for determining rigid body transformations between reference frames @xcite .",
    "challis procedure was originally intended for comparing osteometric measurements in biomechanical analyses .",
    "as we will show , the method can be intuitively adapted to measure rotational dynamics .",
    "first , we give a brief reprise of challis method , and then describe how it is used to study the systems mentioned here .",
    "given a set of points which have coordinates @xmath5 measured in one reference frame and coordinates @xmath6 measured in a second frame , there exists a transformation    @xmath7    where subscript @xmath8 refers to the @xmath8-th point in the set , @xmath9 is a scale factor , @xmath10 is a 3@xmath113 rotation matrix , and @xmath12 is the vector separation of the two reference frames . for our purposes , we may set the scale factor to unity and assume that both coordinate frames share a common origin , thereby setting all elements of @xmath12 to zero .",
    "we are therefore left with @xmath13 and only the rotation matrix to describe the transformation between coordinate frames .",

    "particle tracking @xcite yields vector coordinates @xmath34 for every particle @xmath8 over a distinct set of times .",
    "hence , the first step in tracking rotational motion of a cluster is to track the translational motion of each particle within the cluster . for each cluster ,",

    "the advantage of calculating @xmath44 is that it describes the collective behaviors of particles within a cluster , rather than a property of any individual particle .",

    "diffusive anisotropic clusters with large aspect ratios rotate more freely about a long axis than about a short axis . given @xmath45",
    ", however , one needs only the initial orientation of these axes to compute and compare the motions around them .",
    "for simplicity and to better reproduce the data collection process in typical microscopy experiments , we adopt a length scale of microns and a time scale measured in timesteps ( ts ) , which is equivalent in microscopy to video frames or image stacks .    in conventional particle tracking experiments , it is important to minimize and understand the uncertainty , i.e. the noise , inherent in locating a particle .",
    "typical microscopy experiments combine high magnification optics with ccd cameras to record raw digital images . in the absence of other sources of noise ,",
    "the uncertainty in particle position , i.e. the minimum noise level , depends on the optical resolution [ pixels / distance ] of the instrumentation and the size [ pixels ] of the object being tracked .",
    "standard image processing and particle tracking techniques can locate the centers of particles to within @xmath46 of a pixel , where @xmath47 is the width of the object in pixels .",
    "optical resolution varies between experimental set - ups but is typically in the range of @xmath48 .",
    "the minimum uncertainty in particle position is the product of these factors .",
    "for example , observing a @xmath49 pixel wide object with an optical resolution of @xmath48 leads to a lower limit of @xmath50 nm uncertainty in particle position .",
    "other sources of noise , such as stray light entering the microscope , noise within the ccd camera itself , etc . , slightly increase the uncertainty in particle position and further limit particle tracking resolution .    to test our method",

    "this distribution ensures that the simulated dynamics will be in agreement with the stokes - einstein - debye relation discussed later [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sed ] ) ] . each particle in a tetrahedron",
    "is rotated by an angle @xmath59 about the @xmath60-axis , then by an angle @xmath61 about the @xmath62-axis , and finally by angle @xmath63 about the @xmath64-axis to produce the tetrahedron at the subsequent time .",
    "the rotation matrices used are    @xmath65    @xmath66    thus , given an initial position vector @xmath67 , the subsequent position vector is @xmath68 .",
    "trajectories generated in this way are noise - free in the sense that they are absent of uncertainty in particle position to within machine precision . to mimic the type of experimental noise previously mentioned , we post - process the trajectories by adding gaussian random numbers , with standard deviation @xmath52 , to the particle coordinates .",
    "the levels of noise presented here correspond to uncertainties of @xmath69 nm in the @xmath64- , @xmath62- , and @xmath60-directions .",
    "experimental uncertainties are typically within the range of 20 - 60 nm , and so the levels studied here are relevant to microscopy experiments .",
    "after the noise is added , we apply our method of measuring rotational motion in order to gauge the effect of experimental noise on results .",
    "in this section , we calculate the rotational motions of simulated colloidal clusters using the matrix methods described above .",
    "we focus on a method that uses the rotation matrices to determine the motion of a fictional orientation vector attached to the cluster .",
    "the rotational displacements of one or more such vectors about the center of mass can be used to compare and contrast motions about different axes , which is especially useful when the objects studied are anisotropic and motions about axes are expected to differ @xcite .",
    "we note that a second method exists to calculate rotational displacements using solely the rotation matrix .",
    "this method determines the rotational axis from @xmath10 and can then be used to calculate the magnitude of an angular displacement . while a mathematically direct and general approach , it describes only the average cluster dynamics and can provide no insight into how motions about different axes vary .",
    "given these limitations , we relegate a description of this method to the appendix .      to analyze the rotations of a cluster , we consider the motions of an initial orientational unit vector @xmath70 fixed to the cluster .",
    "we determine its orientation at a later time @xmath41 by applying the set of rotations such that @xmath71 in a similar way as in eq .",

    "one could choose two @xmath70 to study separately : one choice of @xmath70 perpendicular to the long axis ; a second perpendicular to the short .",
    "such a procedure would yield information relating to motions about the long and short axes , respectively .    in line with  @xcite",

    "the stokes - einstein - debye relation states that the msad grows as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the rotational diffusion coefficient . in this paper , we focus on measuring the msads of clusters , but we point out that other techniques exist to quantify rotational dynamics .",

    "[ fig : msadnoise](a ) & ( b )",
    ". however , in the presence of noise in particle positions , rotations can not be accurately resolved below a certain threshold , @xmath95 .",
    "for example , a stationary cluster will appear to make small , but fictional , rotations as a result of this noise , and measurements of the msad will yield @xmath96    where @xmath97 is independent of @xmath80 due of the lack of correlations in noise .    in the case of translational diffusion ,",

    "knowing how uncertainty in particle positions affects measurements of dynamics quantities , such as the msad , is clearly important .",
    "however , one is typically unable to define the noise level so precisely in experiments .",
    "as stated earlier , particle tracking resolution depends on various experimental factors including particle size , optics , and the type of camera used to record images . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msadnoise](a ) , for slowly diffusing clusters and moderate - to - high noise levels , the measurements of the msad may not be representative of the true dynamics until fairly large lag times . at these large @xmath80 ,",
    "statistics are poorer than small @xmath80 , and confident measurements are harder to obtain .",
    "therefore , this type of oversampling can be detrimental to microscopy experiments where data sets consist of a few hundred to a few thousand images .",
    "thus it is important to determine an imaging rate that yields the most information from a data set . in microscopy experiments , one can effectively increase the rotational signal - to - noise ratio between each time step by imaging less frequently . determining the appropriate sampling rates in experiments",
    "can be done by estimating the noise level @xmath52 , the diffusion constant @xmath51 and calculating an approximate @xmath97 .",
    "diffusive motion will begin exceeding noise when @xmath105 . solving for @xmath80",
    "then yields a reasonable sampling lag time .",

    "thus , an estimate for the upper limit is @xmath108 .",
