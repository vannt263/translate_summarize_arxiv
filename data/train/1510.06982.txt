    "methane ( ch@xmath0 ) is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule and the main constituent of natural gas .",
    "it plays a central role in combustion and , along with carbon dioxide , is a major cause of climate change @xcite .",
    "in addition to its terrestrial importance , absorption bands of ch@xmath0 feature prominently in the infrared spectra of numerous astrophysical objects over a broad temperature range .",
    "the onset of ch@xmath0 absorption appears in sub - stellar objects below temperatures of @xmath12000 k @xcite .",
    "indeed the spectrum of hot ch@xmath0 is a defining feature for characterizing brown dwarfs , objects which do not fuse hydrogen in their core and have masses between those of stars and planets .",
    "the t - dwarfs are characterized by the strengthening of ch@xmath0 absorption in the near - infrared @xcite ; thus these objects are sometimes referred to as `` methane '' dwarfs @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath0 remains a prominent absorbing species in astrophysical spectra down to @xmath180 k , the atmospheric temperatures of the outer planets and titan @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ch@xmath0 has been detected in the atmosphere of exoplanets known as hot - jupiters @xcite and it is anticipated that ch@xmath0 detection can be used as a key biosignature for terrestrial exoplanets @xcite .    as a consequence of the ubiquity of ch@xmath0 , the infrared spectrum has been the focus of numerous spectroscopic and theoretical studies , primarily at room temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hitran database @xcite compiles the most recent line parameters of ch@xmath0 and is intended for the remote sensing of the earth s atmosphere @xcite , but it is often also used in astronomy @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of an infrared molecular spectrum ( i.e. , observed vibration - rotation lines ) considerably increases with higher temperatures due to the population of excited levels .",
    "these high - temperature transitions are weak in cold spectra and are therefore not observed . for this reason ,",
    "they are not usually included in resulting `` cold '' line lists , such as hitran .",
    "when these line lists are applied to high - temperature brown dwarf models , it comes as no surprise that ch@xmath0 absorption is underestimated due to these missing high - temperature transitions @xcite .",
    "the use of high temperature data is not solely limited to astrophysical observations as ch@xmath0 spectral features can also be used to monitor combustion processes over similar temperature regimes @xcite .    with the escalation of interest in brown dwarfs and hot - jupiters arising from improved detection methods",
    ", it has been necessary to provide data of ch@xmath0 at elevated temperatures for comparison @xcite .",
    "so far , the infrared spectrum of ch@xmath0 has proved to be a difficult challenge for theory because of the high molecular symmetry and polyad structure arising from close - lying vibrational level interactions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , advances are being made in assigning experimental data and recently , two state - of - the - art theoretical ch@xmath0 line lists have been published by @xcite as well as by @xcite as part of the exomol project @xcite .",
    "currently , these two line lists provide the best broadband comparisons with high temperature environments and are referred to herein as 10to10 @xcite and rnt @xcite .",
    "for example , the 10to10 ch@xmath0 line list ( so named because it contains approximately 10 billion lines ) has been shown to provide good agreement with observed hot ch@xmath0 emission during the shoemaker - levy 9 impact of jupiter as well as with the ch@xmath0 opacity of a brown dwarf @xcite . in both cases",
    "these spectra have effective temperatures in excess of 1000 k and require hot line lists for analysis .",
    "however , despite these recent advances , experimental observations provide the definitive description of ch@xmath0 absorption at high temperatures and are therefore crucial to refining theoretical predictions and matching observation . for astronomical purposes",
    ", it has been shown that empirical line lists produced over the appropriate temperatures can be used for molecular spectra in the submillimeter region @xcite .",
    "this method is particularly useful for so - called astrophysical `` weeds '' @xcite and methanol @xcite where traditional spectroscopic methods can not keep pace with current observations .",
    "the temperature regime of brown dwarf and exoplanets can be achieved in the laboratory and until now , only high - temperature infrared emission spectra of ch@xmath0 have been available at high resolution over the appropriate temperature range @xcite .",
    "this article reports the first such absorption spectra of ch@xmath0 at high temperatures ( up to 900@xmath2c ) .",
    "additionally , we demonstrate the necessary inclusion of a quasi - continuum that is required to replicate observation using our empirical line lists . the inclusion of our data into brown dwarf models compares well with observations and with models that use theoretical line lists containing millions , or even , billions of lines .",
    "nine ch@xmath0 transmittance spectra have been acquired between room temperature ( i.e. , 23@xmath2c ) and 200 @xmath3 900@xmath2c in 100@xmath2c intervals . for each transmittance spectrum ,",
    "four individual spectra are required to correct for the emission of ch@xmath0 and the cell . at each temperature @xmath4 ,",

    "the cell was aligned with the entrance aperture of the spectrometer and the radiation was focused into the instrument using a calcium fluoride lens .",

    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the effect of the emission correction for optically thin and optically thick lines of ch@xmath0 . for optically thin lines ,",
    "the resulting emission - corrected transmittance is a true measure of the absorption depth .",
    "this is more clearly demonstrated when considering optically thick lines . in this case , the lines are saturated , and now the emission correction results in a transmittance of zero ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) . by comparing both the emission and absorption on the same scale ,",
    "these lines are seen to be saturated ( i.e. , equal ) .",
    "the transmittance is then correctly calculated to be zero as expected from kirchhoff s law of thermal radiation that states emissivity and absorptivity are equal .",
    "if the absorption or emission spectra are observed independently , then each spectrum will appear distorted , as previously observed @xcite .         at 700@xmath2c .",
    "the upper panels display the absorption ( orange ) and emission ( blue ) spectrum on the same arbitrary intensity scale ; the lower panels display the transmittance ( red).[fig2 ] ]    the ch@xmath0 molecules begin to decompose near 1000@xmath2c and as a consequence , deposits build up within the quartz cell .",
    "these deposits caused clouding of the cell windows and significantly reduced the transmission at temperatures greater than 900@xmath2c ; therefore reliable measurements at 1000@xmath2c were not achieved .",
    "wspectra @xcite was used to measure line positions and intensities of all absorption lines .",
    "these lists were wavenumber and intensity calibrated with strong lines found in the hitran 2012 database @xcite and line positions are accurate to within @xmath200.002 @xmath9 . in small sections of the transmission spectra , water line residuals have been removed when cancellation was not complete .",

    "although the rfm pathlength is not a true representation of experiment , a consistent treatment between all line lists allows high - resolution comparisons to be made .",

    "both models are the same , except one model includes the corresponding ch@xmath0 continuum cross sections.[fig5 ] ]    figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates that our line lists and continua are also able to match low resolution observations and demonstrate the importance of including the continua for brown dwarf comparisons .",
    "it is only below about 2.19 @xmath11 m that a noticeable difference can be seen .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the sensitivity of our experimental observations in regions between strong absorption polyad bands and the location of the baseline .",
    "the continuum cross sections equal zero for these regions , which are truncated at the noise level .",
    "the continuum is a major contributor for low resolution brown dwarf spectra and a minor adjustment for regions below our experimental sensitivity could improve this difference , but further investigations are required to determine the appropriate shape of the continuum between polyad bands .",
    "another factor relates to the 900@xmath2c continuum cross section near 4600 @xmath9 ( 2.17 @xmath11 m ) , which can be seen to cross the continua at lower temperatures ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with absorption cross sections at other temperatures and wavenumbers , where an overall increase is seen .",
    "the reason for this overlap is due to a necessary baseline correction .",
    "we have tested the effect of increasing the 900@xmath2c continuum for this region and applying this to the vstar models ; the agreement with observation shows improvement .    a similar match to the same brown dwarf at low - resolution has been obtained using the 10to10 ch@xmath0 line list @xcite , which contains billions of lines and is therefore time consuming to compute .",
    "the models used in this work are very much faster to compute , due to the use of a significantly smaller line list , and because numerous weak lines have been represented as a continuum cross section .",
    "the empirical line lists presented in this article are based on the first high - resolution infrared absorption spectra of ch@xmath0 at high temperatures .",
    "combining the relatively small ch@xmath0 line lists and quasi - continuum cross sections from this work shows good agreement with high temperature spectra at high and low resolution .",
    "this work also demonstrates that theoretical calculations of ch@xmath0 have significantly progressed in recent years .",
    "however , it is the line positions that show the largest disagreements with experiment .",

    "when using these data , the line list and continuum cross section that are closest to observation should be employed .",
    "users should be aware that our empirical line parameters will be refined as quantum number assignments are made and more sophisticated analyses are carried out in future .",
    "the scientific potential of high resolution spectra for faint objects , such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs , is only just being realized .",
    "for example , cross correlation of high resolution spectra of the star hd 209458 is able to uncover the faint velocity shifted carbon monoxide absorption from the associated exoplanet hd 209458b @xcite . for this method to work with ch@xmath0",
    ", line positions must match laboratory observations precisely and existing calculated spectra are not satisfactory in this regard .",
    "when line positions are acceptable for low resolution but not high resolution , this cross correlation method has been shown to fail @xcite . over the coming years , new ground and space based telescopes will have greater sensitivity than ever before and it is therefore important to have molecular spectra that can be applied at high resolution as well as low resolution .",
    "currently , only the ch@xmath0 line lists and continuum cross sections presented here are able to satisfy this requirement .    these line lists and quasi - continua can be used for brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheric models but they will also help to refine current theoretical calculations .",
    "furthermore , this work demonstrates an alternative way of providing theoretical line lists .",
    "it is inevitable that line lists based upon experimental observations will be incomplete due to the sensitivity and resolution limitations , however , the inclusion of a quasi - continuum addresses this problem : effectively accounting for billions of lines beyond detection limits .",
    "representing theoretical line lists in a similar way ( i.e. , weak and strong components , where the weak lines are used as an absorption cross section ) can help to significantly reduce calculation times .",

    "<S> hot methane is found in many  cool \" sub - stellar astronomical sources including brown dwarfs and exoplanets , as well as in combustion environments on earth . </S>",
    "<S> we report on the first high - resolution laboratory absorption spectra of hot methane at temperatures up to 1200 k. our observations are compared to the latest theoretical spectral predictions and recent brown dwarf spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation that millions of weak absorption lines combine to form a continuum , not seen at room temperature , is confirmed . our high - resolution transmittance spectra account for both the emission and absorption of methane at elevated temperatures . from these spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an empirical line list and continuum that is able to account for the absorption of methane in high temperature environments at both high and low resolution . </S>",
    "<S> great advances have recently been made in the theoretical prediction of hot methane , and our experimental measurements highlight the progress made and the problems that still remain . </S>"
