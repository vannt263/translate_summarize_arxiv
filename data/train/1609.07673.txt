    "the mathematical foundations of voting theory date back to the late 18th century , when jean - charles borda introduced the borda count method , and the marquis de condorcet wrote about his now well - known paradox .",
    "this discipline saw steady development leading to kenneth arrow s 1950 impossibility theorem @xcite for which he was later awarded a nobel prize .",
    "subsequent decades saw further contributions to social choice theory , using a greater variety of mathematical tools of increasing sophistication , including - but not limited to - probability theory , geometry , topology , and algebra . in the 1990 s , donald saari ,",
    "a mathematician and economist at uc irvine , began to use geometric methods to investigate the structure of voting systems and to understand and generate paradoxes of voting theory . among his many effective approaches , one was the representation of profiles ( collections of ballots ) as elements of a vector space .",
    "more recently , michael orrison and his colleagues at harvey mudd college have recast some of saari s geometric methods in an algebraic framework ( @xcite , @xcite ) and employed the action and representation theory of the symmetric group on vector spaces of profiles .    here , we rely heavily - and build - upon the framework introduced by saari and orrison in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , a significant portion of the vector space formalism we describe here is either explicitly or implicitly found in @xcite .",
    "foremost , we are concerned not only with fully - ranked ballots of candidates , but with a vector space of ` partially ranked ' ballots of arbitrary composition type @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the collection of all candidates )",
    ". these are ballots for which there are @xmath4 first  place candidates , @xmath5 second  place candidates , and so on .",
    "some practical applications for such partially ranked ballots can be found in @xcite .",
    "the well - known family of positional voting methods plays a central role here ; indeed , we prove that all neutral linear cardinal welfare functions are of this form - and repeatedly utilize this fact . at the same time , the most obvious limitation of our scope is that , for most of our results , we are restricted to these linear functions .",
    "previous important contributions to social choice theory , from k. arrow ( @xcite,@xcite ) , a. sen ( @xcite,@xcite ) , and k. suzumura ( @xcite,@xcite ) , to name only a few , make no such restrictions .",
    "nevertheless , there is a compelling presence of algebraic and geometric structure in this limited context .",
    "the results in @xcite are built upon a novel use of the representation theory of the symmetric group on the space of voting profiles .",
    "while this group action plays a role here , our contribution is the emphasis and exploitation of a set of distinguished ` results vectors ' @xmath6 which , by their inner products with profile vectors , completely determine the outcome of an election using a positional voting method .",
    "our more elementary approach is to exploit the euclidean geometry - and inner product - of the vector space of profiles and of election outcomes .",
    "the geometry of this interplay provides a novel and illuminating perspective from which we can examine the behavior of linear voting methods .    as a proof - of - concept for our formalism",
    ", we provide a uniform proof that ( almost ) all neutral linear social choice functions fail to satisfy the ubiquitous _ independence of irrelevant alternatives _ criterion .",
    "this is a well - known result for _ all _ neutral social choice functions ( as a consequence of arrow s theorem ) , but only for fully  ranked ballots .",
    "our results provide a restricted ( only to linear functions ) extension to all partially ranked ballots .",
    "also in the generality of partially ranked ballots , we provide criteria for arbitrary neutral linear social choice functions to satisfy pareto efficiency and a suitably defined _ strong majority criterion_.    there is undoubtedly much more to say than we have here .",
    "we are hopeful that more representation  theoretic tools can be introduced in this framework , perhaps to understand some more nuanced questions concerning insincere voting and the potential for manipulation of voting methods .",
    "the role of the vectors @xmath7 , and their geometry , have some interesting combinatorial content .",
    "further investigations of these vectors will be addressed in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we fix an integer @xmath8 ( the number of candidates ) , and let @xmath9 ( the enumerated list of candidates ) .",
    "let @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) be the set of nonnegative integers ( real numbers ) .",

    "we denote by @xmath15 the vector space of functions from @xmath14 to @xmath16 ; by enumerating a basis , we obtain an isomorphism @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be a composition of @xmath8 .",
