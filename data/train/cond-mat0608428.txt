    "since superconductivity was discovery in hydrated cobaltates @xmath0 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite an enormous amount of attention was focused on this system , in spite of the rather modest critical temperature @xmath7 , that follows a characteristic dome shape @xcite with maximum value @xmath13 around a doping @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , since cobaltates may be considered as electron - doped mott insulators with a layered structure , where @xmath14 ions are in a low spin state ( @xmath15 ) on a triangular lattice , it was expected that the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) scenario proposed long ago by anderson @xcite for the cuprates could be clearly realized in the cobaltates .",
    "the importance of strong electronic correlations , already advanced in view of the small bandwidth of the ( @xmath16 ) levels close to the fermi energy @xcite , was confirmed by recent photoemission studies @xcite showing for @xmath17 a reduction of bandwidth by a factor two with respect to the calculated ones @xcite . in fact , even taking the whole @xmath16 manifold , the bare bandwidth is @xmath18 ev @xcite , while from core level photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , values of the onsite interaction @xmath19 ev were estimated .",
    "hence , electronic correlations seem to play an essential role , so that hubbard or @xmath1-@xmath2 models were proposed @xcite to describe cobaltates .",
    "several unconventional pairing channels and mechanisms were proposed for the superconducting state : a ) pure @xmath1-@xmath2 model rvb based calculations predict singlet @xmath9-wave superconductivity @xcite with time - reversal symmetry breaking ; b ) charge fluctuations predict a triplet next - nearest neighbour ( nnn ) @xmath6-wave state @xcite ; c ) spin - triplet @xmath6-wave superconductivity was also proposed based on phenomenology and symmetry considerations @xcite , due to the topology of the fermi surface @xcite , from weak - coupling studies of a multiorbital hubbard model @xcite , and considering spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "a number of magnetic resonance @xcite and @xmath20sr @xcite experiments are consistent with unconventional triplet superconductivity and exclude time - reversal symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "although those results seem at the moment not conclusive , with some nmr experiments @xcite indicating the possibility for singlet @xmath21-wave superconductivity , specific heat measurements @xcite are consistent with the existence of a superconducting gap with nodal lines . based on the results pointing to triplet superconductivity with nodal lines , @xmath6-wave symmetry appears as a very promising candidate ( see also @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .    besides superconductivity , other features of the electronic structure point to the proximity of other instabilities .",

    "therefore , a more general study is needed , where both @xmath3 as well as the antiferromagnetic spin exchange @xmath2 are considered , in order to clarify the interplay or competition of electronic instabilities in different parts of the phase diagram .",

    "the names fermion - like and boson - like come from the fact that hubbard operators do not verify the usual fermionic and bosonic commutations rules .    in previous papers @xcite",
