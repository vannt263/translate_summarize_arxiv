    "the dependence of the tunnel rate on gate voltage is consistent with a simple model of transport in a quantum dot known as energy - dependent tunneling.@xcite in this model , the tunnel rate depends exponentially on the relative height of the tunnel barrier compared to the chemical potential of the dot , with a larger chemical potential corresponding to a higher tunnel rate .",
    "this explains the trends of the tunnel rate with respect to variations in the gate voltage .",
    "it also explains why the unloading rates are much faster than the loading rates in our dot .",
    "it is important to note that cross talk between the plunger gate and the tunnel barrier would tend to have the opposite effect as energy - dependent tunneling , by raising the tunnel barrier and lowering the tunnel rate .",
    "up to this point , we have studied the tunnel rate between the lead and the ground state of the dot , which varies as a smooth function of the plunger gate voltage , as indicated in fig .  [",

    "specifically , it allows us to replace gate pulsing with time - averaged current measurements .",
    "time - averaging is normally associated with methods where the current flows directly through the quantum dot .",
    "one example is the so - called coulomb diamond plot , where the transport current is measured as a function of source - drain bias @xmath16  and the plunger gate voltage.@xcite such transport measurements are challenging in the few - electron regime , where charge sensing is the preferred experimental technique.@xcite we show here that charge sensing techniques enable spectroscopy of silicon quantum dots , with direct correspondence to coulomb diamond measurements .",

    "[ fig : diamonds](a ) are blockaded .",
    "as @xmath42 is lowered , it becomes level with @xmath44 ; this condition corresponds to the edge of the diamond with positive slope ( blue line in fig .",

    "the condition @xmath49 corresponds to the edge of the diamond with negative slope ( red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds](b ) ) .",
    "when @xmath50 , the electron does not have enough energy to exit the dot .",
    "in this case , the electron occupation becomes fixed at value of @xmath47 , and the current is blocked .",
    "because of the variation in the tunnel rate with gate voltage and the available energy levels , the same information available in a coulomb diamond transport measurement can be derived from time - averaged charge sensing measurements . here , we study this effect in the several - electron regime . figures  [ fig : diamonds](f ) and ( g ) show plots of the transconductance @xmath51 .",
    "when monitoring the charge sensing qpc current in this way , the physical picture of coulomb blockade is unaffected ; however , instead of measuring the current through the quantum dot , which is immeasurably small in this regime , the qpc measures the average dot occupation . in the regime where dot occupation alternates between @xmath48 and @xmath47 , the average occupation depends on the electron dwell time , which depends on the loading and unloading tunnel rates .    the interesting case for charge sensing is when @xmath52 and the dot chemical potential is in the bias window . in this regime , the average fractional occupation @xmath53 , the fractional part of the dot occupation @xmath54 , is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the tunnel rate from the source to the @xmath47-electron ground state , and @xmath57 is the corresponding rate to the drain . at the location of the purple stars in figs .",
    "[ fig : diamonds](d)-(g ) , if the tunnel barriers are tuned such that @xmath58 , the average fractional occupation will be @xmath59 .",
