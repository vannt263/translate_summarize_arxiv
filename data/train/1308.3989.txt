    "main - sequence stars with masses greater than about @xmath4 follow two evolutionary paths ; either they form a degenerate core of o / ne / mg , or a degenerate fe core , which , after undergoing a type ii supernova core collapse , forms a proto - neutron star  @xcite .",
    "neutron stars ( nss ) are also expected to form through the accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf  @xcite . at birth",
    ", nss are rapidly and differentially rotating , which makes them subject to various types of instabilities . among these ,",
    "the dynamical bar - mode instability and the shear - instability are particularly interesting because of their potential role as sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) .    indeed",
    ", a newly born ns may develop a dynamical bar - mode instability when the rotation parameter @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath7 the gravitational binding energy , exceeds a critical value @xmath8 ( see , for instance ,  @xcite for some reviews ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the rapidly rotating ns can become severely deformed , leading to a strong emission of gws in the khz range .",
    "analytic investigations of the conditions under which these dynamical instabilities develop in self - gravitating rotating stars can be found in  @xcite , but these are inevitably restricted to newtonian gravity or to simple shell models . to improve our understanding of these instabilities also in the nonlinear regimes , and to be able to extract useful physical information from the potential gw emission ,",
    "it is clear that a general - relativistic numerical modeling is necessary .",
    "this has been the focus of a number of recent works , e.g. ,  @xcite , which have provided important clues about the threshold for the instability and its survival under realistic conditions . as an example , for a polytropic relativistic star with polytropic index @xmath9 , the calculations reported in  @xcite revealed that the critical value is @xmath10 , and that a simple dependence on the stellar compactness can be used to track this threshold from the newtonian limit over to the fully relativistic one  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations have also revealed that the instability is in general short - lived and that the bar - deformation is suppressed over a timescale of a few revolutions ( this was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and later confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was interpreted as due to a faraday resonance ) .",
    "one aspect of the bar - mode instability that so far has not received sufficient attention is about the occurrence of the instability in magnetized stars .",
    "this is not an academic question since nss at birth are expected to be quite generically magnetized , with magnetic fields that have strengths up to @xmath11 g in ordinary nss and reaching strengths in excess of @xmath12 g in magnetars , if instabilities or dynamos have taken place in the proto - neutron star phase  @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields of this strength can affect both the structure and the evolution of nss  @xcite , and it is natural to expect that they will influence also the development of the instability when compared to the purely hydrodynamical case . a first dynamical study in this direction has been carried out recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the development of the dynamical bar - mode instability has been studied for differentially rotating magnetized stars in newtonian gravity and in the ideal - magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) limit ( i.e. ,  with a plasma having infinite conductivity ) .",
    "not surprisingly , this study found that magnetic fields do have an effect on the development of the instability , but that this is the case only for very strong magnetic fields .",
    "we here consider the same problem , but extend the analysis to a fully general - relativistic framework , assessing the impact that the results have on high - energy astrophysics and gw astronomy .",
    "our investigation of the dynamics of highly - magnetized and rapidly rotating nss is also part of a wider study of this type of objects to explain the phenomenology associated with short gamma - ray bursts .",
    "these catastrophic phenomena , in fact , are normally thought to be related to the merger of a binary system of nss  @xcite , which could then lead to the formation of a long - lived hypermassive ns ( hmns )  @xcite . if highly magnetized , the hmns could then also lead to an intense electromagnetic emission  @xcite .",
    "this scenario has recently been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where numerical simulations of an axisymmetric differentially rotating hmns were carried out .",
    "the hmns had initially a purely poloidal magnetic field , which eventually led to a magnetically driven outflow along the rotation axis .",
    "a similar setup has also been considered in a number of works , either in two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite or in three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations @xcite , with the goal of determining whether or not the conditions typical of a hmns can lead to the development of the magnetorotational ( mri ) instability @xcite .",
    "although this type of simulations in 3d still stretches the computational resources presently available , the very high resolutions employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the careful analysis of the results , provided the first convincing evidence that the mri can develop from 3d configurations .",
    "this has of course important consequences on much of the phenomenology associated with hmnss , as it shows that very strong magnetic fields , up to equipartition , will be produced in the hmns if this survives long enough for the mri to develop .    in the simulations reported here we necessarily adopt much coarser resolutions and",
    "hence we will not be able to concentrate our attention on the development of the mri .",
    "rather , we will here extend our previous work on the dynamical bar - mode instability  @xcite also to the case of magnetized stars , determining when and how magnetic fields can limit the development of the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "our initial models correspond to stationary equilibrium configurations of axisymmetric and rapidly rotating relativistic stars .",
    "more precisely , our initial models are described by a polytropic eos with adiabatic index @xmath13 and are members of a sequence with a constant rest - mass of @xmath14 and a constant amount of differential rotation .",
    "interpreting the results of our simulations can be rather straightforward . because we work in the ideal - mhd limit , the magnetic field lines are `` frozen '' in the fluid and follow its dynamics ( see  @xcite for a recent extension of the code to resistive regime ) . as a consequence , differential rotation drives the initial purely poloidal magnetic field into rotation , winding it up and generating a toroidal component . at early times",
    ", the toroidal magnetic field grows linearly with time , tapping the ns s rotational energy . at later times , the growth starts deviating from the linear behavior and the magnetic tension produced by the very large magnetic - field winding , alters the angular velocity profile of the star . depending on the models adopted and the initial magnetic field strength , the magnetic winding could become the most efficient mechanisms for redistributing angular momentum , with the mri being the dominant one when the alfvn timescale becomes comparable to the magnetic winding timescale .",
    "overall , we find that if the initial magnetic fields are @xmath15 g , then they have a negligible effect on the occurrence of the dynamical bar - mode instability , which develops in close analogy with the purely hydrodynamical case . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial magnetic fields are @xmath3 g , they can suppress the instability completely .",
    "note that the precise threshold marking the stability region depends not only on the strength of the magnetic field , but also on the amount of rotation .",
    "we trace this threshold by performing a number of simulations of a number of sequences having the same parameter @xmath16 but different magnetizations",
    ". an important consequence of our results is that because the instability is suppressed in strongly magnetized nss , these can no longer be considered as potential sources of gws , at least via the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] we describe the numerical methods and the setup employed in our simulations , as well as the full set of equations we solve . in sect .",
    "[ sec : initial ] we mention briefly the main properties of the stellar models adopted as initial data , together with the simplifications and assumptions we make . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we examine in great detail the effects of the presence of an initial poloidal magnetic field on differentially rotating stars covering a wide range in the parameter space .",
    "we further discuss the qualitative and quantitative features of the evolution of models with the same total rest mass but different rest - mass density and angular momentum profiles that are known to be unstable to the purely hydrodynamic bar - mode instability .",
    "finally , we investigate whether magnetic fields affect the stellar evolution even when the bar - mode instability does not develop .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] and two appendices discuss the influence of symmetries on the development of the instability and the convergence of our results . unless stated differently , we adopt geometrized units in which @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the simulations have been carried out using the general - relativistic ideal - mhd ( grmhd ) code ` whiskymhd `  @xcite .",
    "the code provides a 3d numerical solution of the full set of the grmhd equations in flux - conservative form on a dynamical background in cartesian coordinates .",
    "it is based on the same high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) techniques on domains with adaptive mesh refinements ( amr )  @xcite ) as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction method adopted is the one discussed in the piecewise parabolic ( ppm )  @xcite , while the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt ( hlle ) approximate riemann solver  @xcite has been employed in order to compute the fluxes .",
    "the divergence of the magnetic field is enforced to stay within machine precision by employing the flux - cd approach as implemented in  @xcite , but with the difference that we adopt as evolution variable the vector potential instead of the magnetic field .",
    "this method ensures the divergence - free character of the magnetic field since the magnetic field is computed as the curl of the evolved vector potential using the same finite - differencing operators as the ones for computing the divergence of the magnetic field .    because of the gauge invariance of maxwell equations",
    ", a choice needs to be made and we have opted for the simplest one , namely , the algebraic maxwell gauge .",
    "this choice can introduce some spurious oscillations close to the amr boundaries in highly dynamical simulations , but this has not been the case for the simulations reported here . on the other hand ,",
    "it has allowed us to keep the divergence of the magnetic field essentially nearly at machine precision .",
    "a more advanced prescription has been also introduced recently in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this approach requires a certain amount of tuning for optimal performance and will be considered in future works .",
    "additional information on the code can also be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "furthermore , to remove spurious post - shock oscillations in the magnetic field we add a fifth - order kreiss - oliger type of dissipation  @xcite to the vector potential evolution equation with a dissipation parameter of @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the evolution of the gravitational fields is obtained through the ` ccatie ` code , which provides the solution of the conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "the time integration of the evolution equations is achieved through a third - order accurate runge - kutta scheme .",
    "essentially all of the simulations presented in this paper use a 3d cartesian grid with four refinement levels and with outer boundaries located at a distance @xmath21 km from the center of the grid .",
    "the finest resolution is @xmath22 km ( between @xmath23 and @xmath24 points across the stellar radius , depending on the model ) and the coarsest extends up to about @xmath21 km , namely more than five times the stellar radius .",
    "unless stated differently , all of the simulations discussed hereafter have been performed imposing a bitant symmetry , i.e. ,  a reflection symmetry across the @xmath25 plane .    for convenience",
    "we report here the full set of the evolution equations we solve numerically which consists in the coupled systems of einstein and mhd equations , i.e. ,  @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the ricci tensor , the metric tensor and the ricci scalar , respectively . on the electromagnetic side",
    ", @xmath29 is the maxwell tensor , dual of the faraday tensor @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the current four - vector , and on the matter side @xmath32 is the rest - mass density , @xmath33 is the 4-velocity of the fluid satisfying the normalization condition @xmath34 .",
    "the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 is the linear combination of the contributions coming from a perfect fluid , i.e. ,  @xmath36 , and from the electromagnetic fields , i.e. ,  @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 in the expressions above we recall that @xmath40 is the specific enthalpy , @xmath41 the specific internal energy .",
    "hence , the energy density in the rest - frame of the fluid is just @xmath42 . at the same time",
    ", the four - vector @xmath43 represents the magnetic field as measured in the comoving frame , so that the maxwell and faraday tensors are expressed as ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath44 where the second equalities introduce the electric and magnetic fields measured by an observer moving along a normal direction @xmath45 .",
    "we further note that the @xmath46 terms appearing in eqs .  , are absorbed in the definition of the magnetic field .    in the interest of compactness",
    ", we will not discuss here the detailed formulation of the eqs .",
    " we use in the numerical solution and refer the interested reader to the following works where these aspects are discussed in detail : ref .",
    "@xcite for the formulation of the einstein equations and the gauge conditions used , refs .",
    "@xcite for the formulation of the mhd equations and the strategy for enforcing a zero divergence of the magnetic field , refs .",
    "@xcite for the computational infrastructure and the numerical methods used .",
    "what is however important to remark here is that we employ an `` ideal - fluid '' ( or gamma - law ) equation of state ( eos )  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the adiabatic exponent , which we set to be @xmath9 .",
    "more realistic eos could have been used , as done for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , and this will indeed be the focus of future work . at this stage , however , and because this is the first study of this type , the simpler analytic eos   is sufficient to collect the first qualitative aspects of the development of the instability .",
    "determining the convergence properties of our simulations is of course an essential validation of the results presented and a considerable effort has been put into performing these measures within the numerical setup used here . lacking an analytic solution that describes the fully nonlinear development of the bar , we can only perform self - convergence tests at this stage .",
    "the results will be discussed below .    however , there is a regime in our calculations in which we can exploit the knowledge of an analytic solution and this refers to the initial shearing of the poloidal magnetic field by the differentially rotating star .",
    "it is in fact not difficult to show that within an ideal - mhd framework the induction equation predicts a growth of the toroidal magnetic field which is linear in time ( see , for instance , @xcite for a pedagogic presentation of the perturbed induction equation ) . to explore this regime",
    "we have performed a large number of simulations of model ` u11 - 1.0e15 ` with varying resolution and monitored the growth of the square root of the toroidal magnetic energy @xmath49 [ cf .",
    ",  eq .  ( [ eq : emag_tor ] ] ; we recall that the poloidal magnetic field is not expected to grow during this stage ( cf . ,  sect .",
    "[ subsec : untablemodels ] ) .    figure  [ fig : grow_toroidal_res ] reports the results of these simulations relatively to the first @xmath50 ms , with different curves referring to different resolutions .",
    "it is then evident that the curves are getting closer and closer to straight lines as the resolution increases . to measure whether a linear - in - time - growth is actually reached",
    "we have actually computed the growth rate `` @xmath51 '' by fitting the square root of the magnetic energy with a trial function which is a power - law in time with undetermined growth rate , i.e. ,  with @xmath52 where the time interval has been selected to be between @xmath53 to @xmath54 ms .     for three different resolutions . _",
    "top panel : _ order of the self - convergence test , @xmath55 , shown as a function of time .",
    "note that a convergence order around @xmath56 is measured before the bar - mode instability develops and shocks are produced ( gray - shaded area).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    also reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : grow_toroidal_res ] are the values of @xmath51 ( colored symbols ) as a function of the resolution @xmath57 , as well as a fit for @xmath58 ( dashed line ) when assuming a second - order convergence with resolution , i.e. ,  assuming @xmath59 ( the point for @xmath60 km has been excluded from the fit ) . having made this assumption , we do find that the growth rate is in very good agreement with the one expected in this linear regime , with @xmath61 .",
    "of course this result does not prove directly that we have second - order convergence over this period of time .",
    "however , what it does prove is that if a second - order convergence is assumed , then our solution matches the expected perturbative one .",
    "next we consider a more general calculation of the convergence order by performing again simulations of model ` u11 - 1.0e15 ` for a range of resolutions .",
    "this time our results for the convergence are obtained by taking into account the data corresponding to the whole timescale of the simulations , i.e. ,  @xmath62 ms . also in this case we monitor the growth of the toroidal magnetic energy @xmath49 and report in the top panel of fig .  [ fig : grow_toroidal_res_2 ] its evolution for three runs at resolutions : @xmath63 , and @xmath64 km , respectively .",
    "the bottom panel of the same figure reports instead the convergence order @xmath55 , computed via a self - convergence test  @xcite , when shown as a function of time .    in this case",
    "it is then possible to recognize that the code does indeed converge at around second order during the linear growth stage ( i.e. ,  for @xmath65 ms ) , in agreement with the results found in purely hydrodynamical simulations  @xcite , or with the new resistive code  @xcite .",
    "however , as the bar - mode instability develops , the second - order convergence is lost and the convergence order reduces to one .",
    "this is not surprising as the development of the bar also leads to the formation of shocks , which necessarily degrade our solution to a first - order convergence .",
    "we also note that the large variations in the convergence order shown in the gray - shaded area of fig .",
    "[ fig : grow_toroidal_res_2 ] ( i.e. ,  for @xmath66 ms ) are simply the consequence of the fact that the instability starts growing at different times for different resolutions and this inevitably leads to large excursions in @xmath55 .",
    "because all the major considerations made about the onset and development of the bar deformation , as well as the estimates for the growth rates and frequencies , are obtained after looking at the first 20 ms of the evolution , we conclude that all of our results have been achieved with solutions converging at the expected rates ."
