    "<S> in this article , we investigate the impact of twisted space - time on the photoelectric effect , i.e. , we derive the @xmath0-deformed threshold frequency . in such a way </S>",
    "<S> we indicate that the space - time noncommutativity strongly enhances the photoelectric process .       </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1     @xmath2     @xmath3     @xmath4    the suggestion to use noncommutative coordinates goes back to heisenberg and was firstly formalized by snyder in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there were also found formal arguments based mainly on quantum gravity @xcite , @xcite and string theory models @xcite , @xcite , indicating that space - time at the planck scale should be noncommutative , i.e. , it should have a quantum nature . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there appeared a lot of papers dealing with noncommutative classical and quantum mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) as well as with field theoretical models ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , in which the quantum space - time is employed .    in accordance with the hopf - algebraic classification of all deformations of relativistic @xcite and nonrelativistic @xcite symmetries </S>",
    "<S> , one can distinguish three basic types of space - time noncommutativity ( see also @xcite for details ) : +   +   * 1 ) * canonical ( @xmath5-deformed ) type of quantum space @xcite-@xcite @xmath6 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ; , \\label{noncomm}\\ ] ] +   * 2 ) * lie - algebraic modification of classical space - time @xcite-@xcite @xmath6 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\rho } { x}_{\\rho}\\ ; , \\label{noncomm1}\\ ] ] and +   +   * 3 ) * quadratic deformation of minkowski and galilei spaces @xcite , @xcite-@xcite @xmath6 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\rho\\tau } { x}_{\\rho } { x}_{\\tau}\\ ; , \\label{noncomm2}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 being constants . </S>",
    "<S> +   + moreover , it has been demonstrated in @xcite , that in the case of the so - called n - enlarged newton - hooke hopf algebras @xmath10 the twist deformation provides the new space - time noncommutativity of the form . </S>",

    "<S> , we assume that photons emitted by transplanckian ( noncommutative ) source are described by the nonrelativistic oscillator model @xcite defined on the following twist - deformed n - enlarged newton - hooke phase space @xmath20 = 2if_{\\kappa}({t})\\;\\;\\;,\\;\\;\\ ; [ \\;\\hat { p}_{1},\\hat { p}_{2}\\ ; ] = 2ig_{\\kappa}({t})\\;,\\label{rel1}\\\\ & & [ \\;\\hat { x}_{i},\\hat { p}_{j}\\ ; ] = i\\hbar \\delta_{ij}\\left[1 + f_{\\kappa}({t})g_{\\kappa}({t})/\\hbar^2\\right]\\ ; , \\label{rel2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an arbitrary function @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , its construction seems to be quite difficult and for this reason here we consider only toy - model in which oscillations of emitted light are described by the nonrelativistic and first quantized noncommutative oscillator model @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> then the corresponding hamiltonian operator is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 denoting the mass and frequency of a particle , respectively . in terms of commutative variables </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 , which correspond to the low - energy observer , it takes the form satisfy @xmath26 = [ \\ ; { p}_{i } , { p}_{j}\\ ; ] = 0 $ ] , @xmath27 = i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}$ ] and describe , for example , the surface of metal in a typical laboratory room . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 the corresponding energy spectrum can be find with the use of time - dependent creation / anni - hilation operator procedure and it looks as follows @xmath31 + \\hbar\\omega_{-}(t ) \\left[n_- + \\frac{1}{2}\\right]\\;\\;;\\;\\;n_\\pm = 0 , 1 , 2 , \\ldots\\ ; , \\label{eigenvalues}\\ ] ] with frequencies @xmath32 besides , one can observe that for functions @xmath33 and @xmath21 such that @xmath34 we have @xmath35 + \\hbar\\omega(t ) \\left[n_- + \\frac{1}{2}\\right ] \\;. </S>",
    "<S> \\label{landau}\\ ] ] it means that the spectrum ( [ eigenvalues ] ) becomes isotropic and the corresponding energy quanta takes the form ) we consider further excitations only in one direction . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 particularly , for the canonical deformation @xmath37 we get @xmath38 + \\hbar\\omega_{\\theta } \\left[n_- + \\frac{1}{2}\\right ] \\ ; , \\label{landauek}\\ ] ] with a constant frequency @xmath39 for which @xmath40 .    as mentioned above , in the hamiltonian function ( [ 2dhn ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the frequency @xmath24 corresponds to the frequency of emitted light described in terms of noncommutative variables @xmath41 associated with the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , the formula ( [ quanta ] ) gives the corresponding energy quanta ( obviously different than @xmath42 ) in terms of commutative variables @xmath25 , i.e. , it describes the deformed energy of a single photon which is detected by low - energy observer . </S>",
    "<S> it is simply the energy quanta which should be detected on a surface of metal in a typical laboratory room . in other words </S>",
    "<S> the formula ( [ quanta ] ) gives the energy of photons emitted for example by transplanckian ( noncommutative ) astrophysical sources which arrive to ( commutative ) earth .    </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in our further analysis , we exchange in ( [ equation ] ) the quanta @xmath18 by the deformed ones @xmath43 such that @xmath44 one can see that the main difference between ( [ equation ] ) and ( [ defequation ] ) concerns the shape of the function @xmath45 . in the first ( undeformed ) </S>",
    "<S> case it remains linear in the frequency @xmath24 while for the second process it forms the third degree polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> next one can ask for so - called threshold quanta , i.e. , for such an energy portion for which the frequency @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of ( [ trequation ] ) with respect to the frequency @xmath46 seems to be trivial @xmath49 in the case of equation ( [ trdefequation ] ) the situation is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can find its three roots - two of them are complex while the third one remains real ; it looks as follows @xmath50 the solutions ( [ solution ] ) and ( [ defsolution ] ) define the threshold frequencies for processes ( [ equation ] ) and ( [ defequation ] ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to the simplest ( canonical ) deformation of the phase space ( [ rel1 ] ) , ( [ rel2 ] ) such ( as already mentioned ) that @xmath51 then , in accordance with the relation ( [ condition ] ) we have @xmath52 consequently , in such a case , due to the formula ( [ stalacze ] ) , equation ( [ defequation ] ) takes the form @xmath53 while the corresponding threshold frequency @xmath46 is equal to @xmath54 obviously , for the deformation parameter @xmath0 approaching zero we should reproduce from ( [ thetasolution ] ) the standard relation ( [ solution ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides we have ( see figure 1 and 2 ) @xmath55 which means that in our treatment the canonical noncommutativity strongly enhances the photoelectric effect . </S>"
