    "the sketch corresponding to a conductance of @xmath64 is shown on the right hand side : two subbands contribute fully and one subband contributes half to the overall conductance .",

    "@xcite ) . comparing our data to data of a defect - free qpc  @xcite defined in a 2deg with mobility @xmath78",
    ", we find subtle differences in the transconductance pattern .",
    "although the qpc in reference  @xcite is measured at a lower temperature ( @xmath79 ) than our device ( @xmath9 ) , second order integer plateaus seem to be suppressed as long as no magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 2deg .",
    "the authors state that `` due to the suppression of backscattering in the presence of a small magnetic field the reappearance of the integer plateaus at high @xmath19 can be clearly observed '' .",
    "our qpc is defined in a 2deg with mobility @xmath80 and second order integer plateaus are clearly resolved at @xmath2 .",
    "these observations indicate that even though the mean free path of the electrons is much larger than the length of the qpc in both cases , a higher electron mobility still manifests itself as reduced backscattering in the regime of nonlinear conductance .    as seen from the sketches in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] , the maximum extent of the diamonds in @xmath19 corresponds to the energy spacing @xmath65 of the involved qpc subbands .",
    "the whole pattern of transconductance diamonds is sheared with features at positive @xmath19 shifted by about @xmath81 to more positive gate voltage than in a perfectly symmetric configuration .",
    "this asymmetry could hint at a slight asymmetry of the qpc s coupling to source and drain but might also be explained by a gradual drift of the local potential over the measurement time of @xmath82 .    the effect of @xmath19 onto the confinement potential , the so - called self - gating , manifests itself as a deviation from a pattern of straight lines  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear]a ) it appears that self - gating plays an important role mainly close to pinch - off ( white dashed line ) and perhaps at very large @xmath19 , where no clear quantization is observed any more . since self - gating appears not to dominate the shape of the transconductance pattern it is possible to learn more about the confinement potential by comparing the position of transconductance nodes in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear]a ) .",
    "three exemplary nodes are highlighted by white circles .",
    "they correspond to the resonance conditions ( from top to bottom ) ( @xmath83 ) , ( @xmath84 ) and ( @xmath85 ) , respectively .",
    "the fact that these resonance conditions occur at almost the same gate voltage ( along a straight line ) means that the subband - spacings @xmath86 and @xmath87 are very similar at this gate voltage ( compare sketches in fig .  [",
    "fig : bias ] ) . therefore the transversal confinement can be well described by a harmonic potential .",
    "if the confinement potential were for example a square well , the subband spacings would increase with higher mode number and hence the higher order modes would occur at more positive gate voltage than the linear response node .    as a comparison to the clean and regular pattern of qpc1 , figure  [ fig : nonlinear]b ) shows the transconductance of qpc2 .",
    "higher order plateaus are visible for @xmath88 but are obscured by noise at more negative bias which is usually related to tunneling events from the gates into the doping layer  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the five leftmost diamonds is distorted with the upper and lower tip being shifted to more negative gate bias .",
    "this shift as well as the curvature of the plateau borders follows the dependence observed in quantum wires and arises from the requirement of satisfying charge neutrality with a 1-dimensional density of states while applying a finite source - drain voltage  @xcite .",
    "the quantum wire - like characteristic is consistent with the geometry of the gates which should create a channel that is longer than the screening length of the 2deg ( compare inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sample]b ) ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that also in the quantum wire - like qpc2 , we observe a well pronounced half - plateau related to the 0.7-anomaly which resembles the features observed in  @xcite .",
    "since we do not observe defect - related resonances in qpc2 , the design might be extended to even longer gate - defined quantum wires  @xcite in order to study the length - dependence of the 0.7-anomaly .",
    "however , the observation of diffusive transport  @xcite in @xmath89 long quantum wires ( with the mean free path in the 2deg being @xmath90 ) suggests that gate - defined quantum wires might not profit from an increased free electron mobility at least if split - gate technology is used for confinement .",
    "as discussed earlier , the transconductance plot can now be used to reconstruct the confinement potential .",

    "the subband spacings increase monotonically with more negative gate bias , indicating that the confinement potential becomes narrower and steeper while approaching pinch - off .",
    "this trend has been observed before  @xcite and can be explained by the reduced influence of screening on the confinement potential when the local electron density is reduced  @xcite .",
    "since the higher order plateaus indicate that the confinement potential of qpc1 has a close - to harmonic shape , we can now use the measured subband spacings to apply bttiker s saddle - point model  @xcite to our linear response data and extract all parameters of the potential profile at the constriction .",
    "since qpc2 shows quantum wire - like transport characteristics , the model is not expected to reflect the exact potential shape of qpc2 , but should still give qualitatively meaningful results .",

    "the exchange - enhanced @xmath139-factor @xmath140 can be extracted via @xmath141 , where @xmath140 is the effective @xmath139-factor and @xmath142 denotes the bohr magneton .",

    "however , the magnitude of the exchange enhancement is different : @xmath146 was reported by thomas at al . , while our results indicate a much stronger enhancement .",
    "assuming that disorder reduces the effectiveness of the exchange enhancement , the observation of strongly enhanced @xmath139-factors can be interpreted as another manifestation of the good sample quality .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the transport properties of two differently shaped constrictions that were defined within a high - mobility 2deg .",
    "transport spectroscopy in the linear response regime demonstrates that conductance quantization is observed and that no scattering centers are found when shifting qpc1 between the gates .",
    "the 0.7-anomaly is investigated by varying the temperature and by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the 2deg .",
    "depending on the ratio of these two parameters we observe either a weakening or an enhancement of the 0.7-anomaly which is discussed in view of spin - polarized edge channels mimicking the 0.7 scenario .",
    "measurements at finite source - drain bias give access to the subband spacings of the qpc and reveal that qpc1 is described best by a short constriction whereas qpc2 shows quantum wire - like characteristics .",
    "in addition to qpcs defined in standard 2degs , resonances at large bias are observed in qpc1 that correspond to higher order transport conditions .",
    "these higher order resonance conditions give valuable information about the shape of the confinement potential and enable the reconstruction of the full saddle point potential in the constriction .",
    "knowing the shape ( and hence the slope ) might prove important for the investigation of many body states like the 0.7 anomaly or the transmission of fractional quantum hall states . at finite magnetic field and lower temperature , a strongly exchange - enhanced @xmath139-factor",
    "is observed which we interpret as the result of a very smooth confinement potential . while the measurements on qpcs are possible with high signal to noise ratio if the gate voltages are always swept in the same regime and direction , it was not possible to form a stable quantum dot with the same technique on the same wafer . for future interferometer experiments on high - mobility samples in the fractional quantum hall regime",
    "it is desirable to prepare split - gate electrodes on high - mobility wafers that do not rely on screening electrons at the x - valley and thereby allow stable gate operation .",
