    "since the pioneering work of @xcite orbit superposition techniques have become an important tool in the dynamical modelling of spheroidal stellar systems . stationary distribution functions ( dfs ) of such systems are subject to jeans theorem and hence depend on the phase - space coordinates only via the integrals of motion . in the axisymmetric case",
    "these integrals are energy @xmath1 , angular momentum along the axis of symmetry @xmath2 and for most potentials an additional , non - classical `` third integral '' @xmath3 . because any set of integrals of motion essentially represents an orbit and vice versa , the df can be approximated by the sum of single - orbit dfs , with the only adjustable parameter being the total amount of light carried by the orbit .",
    "the main task that remains to adequately describe hot stellar systems is to find an appropriate set of orbits .",
    "orbit superposition techniques have been used to model such systems in various symmetries ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with the goal of determining different dynamical parameters like central black hole masses , internal velocity anisotropy or global mass - to - light ratios .",
    "an orbit library tracing the phase - space structure of a trial potential is fitted to observed photometry and kinematics , to decide , whether or not it gives a valid model of the corresponding galaxy .    in the spherical case",
    "there exists a well - known mass - anisotropy degeneracy permitting in general convincing fits to the projected velocity dispersion @xmath4 even if the trial potential differs from the true one @xcite . with complete knowledge of the full line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) however ,",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the df , given the potential is known @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even for the realistic case where the potential is not known in advance @xcite and @xcite have shown how the information contained in the losvds can constrain both , the potential and the df .    likewise , in the axisymmetric case , @xcite have calculated realistic smooth dfs and have shown that a similarily close relationship exists between the potential and internal kinematics on the one side and the projected kinematics on the other side .",
    "however , fits of axisymmetric libraries still pose some additional open questions .",
    "recently , @xcite discussed the indeterminacy of the reconstruction of the potential in general axisymmetric systems from two- or three - dimensional data sets , by studying the shape of the @xmath5-contours describing the quality of the orbital fit .",
    "@xcite argued that even in case of a mathematically non - degenerate @xmath6-system an artificial degeneracy occurs , caused by the discreteness of the orbit library and emphasized the role of appropriate smoothing , although not providing a definite solution .",
    "@xcite critically analysed their arguments and emphasized that both high quality comprehensive data sets and orbit libraries are needed to achieve a reliable modeling of axisymmetric systems .",
    "in view of this discussion concerning orbit - based dynamical models it seems worthwhile to step back and investigate how well orbit libraries represent the phase - space structure of a given dynamical system .",
    "this includes the examination of the choice of orbits , which in the generic axisymmetric case is difficult , since part of the phase - space structure is unknown due to our ignorance related to @xmath3 .",
    "a key tool for such an analysis are the orbital phase - volumes which accomplish the transformation from the relative contributions of individual orbits to the library , the so called orbital occupation numbers or orbital weights , into phase - space densities ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the availability of such phase - volumes actually offers several applications :    1 .",
    "[ project df ] accurate phase - volumes allow to calculate internal and projected properties like density and velocity profiles , line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) etc .",
    "of general axisymmetric dfs @xmath7 via orbit libraries . besides the possibility to systematically study the structure of general axisymmetric systems , these profiles provide a direct check of the choice of orbits via their comparison with those calculated from directly integrating the dfs .",
    "2 .   [ reconstruct df ] from any fitted library one can reconstruct the corresponding df via the phase - volumes and thus reconstruct the df from any observed early - type galaxy in the axisymmetric approximation .",
    "3 .   [ compare df ] if the library is fitted to some reference data constructed from a df , then [ reconstruct df ] allows to investigate how closely the fit matches the input df and to implement an effective regularisation scheme , permitting to fit real ( noisy ) data sets .",
    "@xcite touched the problem by writing down the transformation from cells of integrals to the corresponding phase - space volumes .",
    "however , the resulting relations are only suitable for explicitly known integrals , e.g. for single orbits only in the rare case all integrals are known . for components integrated about the unknown integrals they have been exploited by e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to introduce a general implementation for the calculation of individual orbital phase - volumes in any axisymmetric potential and , by following applications [ project df ] and [ compare df ] to prove that our libraries accurately map given dynamical systems .",
    "this directly justifies our setup of the library and sets the basis for our project to recover the dynamical structure and mass composition of a sample of flattened early - type galaxies in the coma cluster . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will focus on the question of how much smoothing has to be applied in order to get an optimal estimate of the dynamical system underlying a given set of noisy and spatially incomplete observational data .",

    "<S> ( in preparation ) . applying a voronoi tessellation in the surface of section we are able to assign accurate phase - space volumes to individual orbits and to reconstruct the full three - integral phase - space distribution function ( df ) of any axisymmetric orbit library . </S>",
    "<S> two types of tests have been performed to check the accuracy with which dfs can be represented by appropriate orbit libraries . </S>",
    "<S> first , by mapping dfs of spherical @xmath0-models and flattened plummer models on to the library we show that the resulting line - of - sight velocity distributions and internal velocity moments of the library match those directly derived from the df to a precision better than that of present day observational errors . </S>",
    "<S> second , by fitting libraries to the projected kinematics of the same dfs we show that the distribution function reconstructed from the fitted library matches the input df to a rms of about 15 per cent over a region in phase - space covering 90 per cent of the mass of the library . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved accuracy allows us to implement effective entropy - based regularisation to fit real , noisy and spatially incomplete data .    </S>",
