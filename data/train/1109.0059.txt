    "recently , research in complex systems has paid particular attention to elucidate some of the mechanisms leading to interesting economic and social phenomena , such as opinion formation , self - organization , distribution of richness , formation of coalitions , land and air traffics , and evolution of social structures @xcite .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been proposed to understand social systems .",
    "axelrod @xcite introduced a model to study in particular the dissemination of cultures among interacting individuals or agents in which a ) the more culturally similar are the agents , the greater the chance of interaction between them , and b ) interaction increments similarity between individuals . among the interesting results obtained with this model",
    "is a nonequilibrium transition from a monocultural state , where all agents share the same cultural features , to a multicultural state , where individuals mostly have their own features , as the cultural diversity increases @xcite .",
    "the axelrod model has been widely employed to analyze the effect of cultural drift caused by noise @xcite , repulsive interactions between individuals @xcite , and mass media @xcite on social systems .",
    "the effect of the mass media , which is normally modeled as a uniform external field with values in the range [ 0,1 ] , has been of special interest since it was discovered that in finite square networks there is a critical field @xmath5 above which the state of the system is always multicultural ( disordered ) @xcite .",
    "it was also found that for values of the number of cultural traits @xmath6 the state is always multicultural , independently of the field value @xmath7 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the critical value of the nonequilibrium multicultural - monocultural phase transition in the absence of an external field ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "later , it was shown that even for vanishing @xmath7 the monocultural state is destabilized in very large systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was found that for the axelrod model in complex networks the system can order in a vector state different from the one imposed by the external field @xcite .",
    "all these are very counterintuitive findings , opposed to what is classically found in physics for spin systems that monotonously align with the external field .",
    "interestingly , ordered phases that are not aligned with the external field are only encountered in fully connected , in random and in scale - free networks .",
    "it was thus claimed that long - range interactions , absent in regular lattices , are required for the appearance of this result @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium phase transition ( hereafter we will omit the term `` nonequilibrium '' ) of the axelrod model is characterized by an order parameter @xmath9 that is usually defined as the average size of the largest cultural cluster @xmath10 in the system normalized by the total number of agents @xmath11 ; @xmath12 . in the monocultural ( ordered )",
    "state @xmath13 and in the multicultural ( disordered ) state @xmath14 .",
    "even though this order parameter appropriately identified both the ordered and the disordered phase emerging in the axelrod model , it does not clearly define the critical region . here , we show that the cluster size entropy @xmath15 , which is defined in terms of the probability that an occupied site of the lattice belongs to a cluster containing @xmath16 sites , can be used as another powerful tool for the analysis of the phenomenology of the axelrod model .",
    "the cluster size entropy measures the number of clusters of different sizes and is related to the diversity of the system @xcite .",
    "theoretically , as a function of the probability of occupation @xmath15 should be zero in both the ordered and the disordered phase , since the former is constituted by a single cluster of the size of the system and the latter is formed by a large number of small clusters of similar sizes .",
    "@xmath15 should have a maximum at the transition where the diversity of cluster sizes is maximum .",
    "thus , a peak develops as the phase transition takes place , which leads to a much better definition of the critical region .    in statistical physics",
    ", cluster size entropy has been used in the study of problems such as percolation @xcite and complex systems @xcite . in their studies on percolation , tsang and co - workers",
    "@xcite found that the cluster entropy shows a maximum at the percolation threshold , where a group of neighboring occupied sites forms a cluster that expands from one edge of the 2d lattice to the opposite one causing an abrupt decrease in the cluster entropy of the system . in the context of the axelrod model ,",
    "cluster entropy measures the number of cultural groups of different sizes and was first used by villegas - febres and olivares - rivas @xcite in an attempt to establish a connection with thermodynamics .",
    "cluster entropy was also utilized within the axelrod model to partially characterize the inclusion of repulsion among agents in a regular lattice @xcite .    to demonstrate the usefulness of the cluster entropy in the analysis of complex networks , here we employ this property for the first time to carry out a throughout study on the monocultural - multicultural phase transition of the axelrod model .",
    "we analyze the effects of the topology of the network and the mass media on this phase transition . regarding the topology , we vary the probability @xmath17 of random rewiring between sites from 0 ( regular networks ) to 1 ( random networks ) .",
    "in addition to determining more exactly the critical value @xmath2 of the axelrod model , we establish a mathematical expression that relates @xmath2 with the important parameter @xmath3 ( number of cultural features ) in finite regular lattices and display in a much clearer form some other known properties . considering the imposition of the mass media , we find that partially ordered states that are not aligned with the field can be formed in short - range - interaction regular networks , in contraposition to the claim by gonzlez - avella _ et al .",
    "a new @xmath4 phase diagram is proposed for the axelrod model in regular lattices .",
    "the original axelrod model is defined on a square lattice of @xmath11 sites ( social agents ) .",
    "the state of the @xmath18 agent is defined by a set of @xmath3 cultural features ( e.g. , religion , sport , politics , etc . )",
    "represented by a vector @xmath19 .",
    "each feature @xmath20 of the agent @xmath21 is first randomly assigned with a uniform distribution of the integers in the interval @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the variable @xmath23 defines the cultural traits allowed per feature and thus measures the cultural variability in the system .",
    "there are @xmath24 possible cultural states .",
    "the procedure to establish the dynamics of the system is as follows : ( 1 ) choose randomly two nearest neighbor agents @xmath21 and @xmath25 , then ( 2 ) calculate the number of shared features ( cultural overlap ) between the agents @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 then ( 3 ) pick up randomly a feature @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and with probability @xmath30 set @xmath31 .",
    "these time steps are iterated and the dynamics stops when a frozen state is reached ; i.e. , either @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "a cluster is a set of connected agents with the same state .",
    "monocultural or ordered phases are composed of a cluster of the size of the system where @xmath34 .",
    "multicultural or disordered phases consist of two or more clusters .    to study the effect of an external field in the original axelrod model just described some modifications are needed .",
    "we define a uniform external field as a vector @xmath35 , where @xmath36 $ ] , with strength @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "this parameter @xmath7 regulates the probability for the agent - field interactions .",
    "each agent has a probability @xmath7 of interacting with the field and a probability ( @xmath38 ) of interacting with one of its nearest neighbors .    in the dynamic",
    "described above the agent @xmath25 is substituted by the field @xmath39 and the whole sequence follows in the same way : ( 1 ) choose randomly an agent @xmath21 , then ( 2 ) with probability @xmath7 agent @xmath21 and the field @xmath39 interact , ( 3 ) calculate the number of shared features ( cultural overlap ) between the agent and the field @xmath40 . if @xmath41 then ( 4 ) pick up randomly a feature @xmath28 such that @xmath42 and with probability @xmath43 set @xmath44 .",
    "if agent @xmath21 and the field @xmath39 do not interact , ( 5 ) choose randomly an agent @xmath25 in the nearest neighborhood of agent @xmath21 .",
    "if with probability @xmath38 agents @xmath21 and @xmath25 interact , ( 6 ) compute the cultural overlap @xmath26 . if @xmath27 ( 7 ) with probability @xmath30 set @xmath31 .",
    "the dynamics stops when a frozen state is reached .    to generate randomized lattices , required for the topology analysis",
    ", we used the watts - strogatz algorithm @xcite .",
    "starting with a regular network of @xmath11 agents ( with periodic boundary conditions ) , each link is visited and with probability @xmath17 is removed and rewired at random ( avoiding self - linked nodes ) .",
    "this random rewiring process produces networks with topologies that go from perfect regularity @xmath45 to full randomness @xmath46 .",
    "the cluster size entropy is defined as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the probability of occupation ( probability @xmath49 of taking a particular value of the cultural trait ) and @xmath50 the probability that an agent belongs to a cluster of size @xmath16 .",
    "here we vary the disorder parameter @xmath17 of the network from 0 to 1 to see the effect on the monocultural - multicultural phase transition of the axelrod model .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] displays the cluster size entropy as a function of the probability of occupation @xmath51 and , for comparison , the order parameter @xmath9 against the cultural trait @xmath23 for f=2 and f=5 in networks of @xmath52 agents .",
    "there are various relevant issues in this figure that need consideration .",
    "the maximum of the cluster entropy curves is located around the corresponding onset trait @xmath2 of the monocultural - multicultural phase transitions as studied with @xmath9 .",
    "the peak of a cluster size entropy distribution corresponds to the state of maximum size disorder that occurs at the transition .",
    "thus , the average size of the largest cluster becomes finite when the maximum size disorder occurs .",
    "the size entropy brings out the fact that as the system moves from a disordered phase , in which most agents occupy each a single cluster , to an ordered phase , in which all agents occupy just one cluster of the system size , the system goes through a critical region where agents become agglomerated in clusters of different sizes .",
    "we see in the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that the maximum of the cluster entropy defines more precisely the critical value @xmath2 than the finite value of the order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "another feature to observe in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is that the critical value @xmath53 ( @xmath2 ) becomes smaller ( larger ) as @xmath17 goes from @xmath54 ( regular networks ) to @xmath55 ( fully random networks ) , in complete agreement with the results obtained with the order parameter @xmath9 by klemm _",
    "we believe that the collapse of the curves corresponding to @xmath56 is due to finite - size effects and not to the lack of any further dynamics that indeed seems to develop up to @xmath57 in networks of large size @xcite .",
    "next , we point out that the height of the cluster entropy curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] reveals a new characteristics of the axelrod model that was impossible to uncover by means of the order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath17 increases the maximum of the size entropies becomes smaller , suggesting less cluster diversity at the transition .",
    "thus , it appears that in random networks , due to the presence of long - range links , the formation of the system - size cluster defining the ordered state of the axelrod model is more efficient ( explores a smaller region of the cluster size space ) than in regular networks .",
    "the most highlighted findings of the present analysis on the effect of topology in the axelrod model are observed in the scaled data of figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , and [ fig:4 ] for network randomness @xmath58 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "these figures display the normalized cluster entropy @xmath59 versus the normalized probability of occupation @xmath60 for different values of the cultural - feature number @xmath3 . here , @xmath61 is the value of the cluster entropy at the peak maximum .",
    "the insets show the corresponding regular data .",
    "all three plots show that , independently of the network randomness , the overall dynamics of the axelrod model for @xmath62 is unambiguously different from that for any value @xmath63 , and that the dynamics is the same for all values @xmath63 .",
    "the plots indicate that the axelrod model for @xmath62 and @xmath63 must belong to different `` universality classes '' in the terminology of statistical physics .",
    "this agrees with previous works that claimed that the transition is first - order type for @xmath63 and second - order type for @xmath62 @xcite .    the width of the cluster size entropy distribution may give a clue of the order of the transition .",
    "the more narrow distributions of the cluster entropy for @xmath63 ( figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , and [ fig:4 ] ) compared with the distributions for @xmath62 indicate that the system crosses over from disorder ( a large number of clusters exist ) to order ( just one cluster size is present ) in a sudden manner , which is typical of first - order - like transitions .",
    "broad distributions , instead , suggest that the system moves from one regime to the other in a smooth manner . a finite number of clusters of all sizes starts to form in the disordered phase and as the system crosses over to the ordered side those clusters of all sizes agglomerate in just one of the size of the system .",
    "this is the behavior expected in second - order - like transitions .",
    "[ 0.62 ]    notably , the normalized cluster entropies are independent of @xmath3 for @xmath64 , indicating that there is a unique axelrod dynamics for values @xmath6 .",
    "this conclusion is robust against finite - size effects , as is demonstrated by the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "it is widely known that the monocultural - multicultural phase transition occurs at a critical value @xmath2 that increases as f augments @xcite .",
    "however , there is no expression relating @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here",
    ", we provide such an equation valid in regular lattices ( @xmath65 ) of finite sizes : @xmath66 this expression 1 ) defines the value of the cultural trait @xmath23 above which the system will always be in a multicultural state and 2 ) states that for any value of @xmath3 the system will always be monocultural for @xmath67 .",
    "equation  ( [ critq ] ) appears to hold for other values of the network randomness @xmath17 with a pre - factor that becomes larger as @xmath17 increases .",
    "gonzlez - avella _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that in the presence of an external field the axelrod model displays a rich @xmath4 phase diagram in fully connected , in random and in scale - free 2d networks for @xmath68 .",
    "a second ordered phase was found that is not aligned with the external field and that in complex networks does not cover the whole system .",
    "gonzlez - avella _ et al .",
    "_ argue that this ordered phase is caused by the long - range interactions characteristic of complex networks , and that such a phase does not exist in regular ( short - range interaction ) networks .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the cluster entropy against @xmath49 and the order parameter versus @xmath23 in a @xmath69 regular network for several values of the field strength @xmath7 and for @xmath70 and @xmath68 .",
    "one of the effects of the external field is to move the critical value @xmath53 toward higher occupation probabilities , as occurs when the number of cultural features @xmath3 is reduced ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the limiting @xmath71 as @xmath72 is very close to the limiting @xmath73 as @xmath74 .    more relevant , a second peak is observed in the cluster entropies of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for @xmath75 that indicates the occurrence of a second phase transition .",
    "these cluster entropies are constituted by two overlapping entropy distributions whose peaks correspond to the onset of phase transitions .",
    "the second peaks in @xmath15 in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] correspond to reentrant behaviors in the order parameter @xmath9 in the lower panels .",
    "that is , as the value of @xmath23 is lowered the system moves from a multicultural to an ordered - like phase , then returns to the multicultural phase , and finally goes to a monocultural phase .",
    "the ordered - like phase makes the phase diagram of the axelrod model in regular networks more complex than previously thought @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the second transition both for @xmath70 and for @xmath68 indicates that its existence does not depend on @xmath3 .",
    "a further analysis reveals that the system in the extra ordered phase , called here `` crossing phase '' , is mainly formed by a large cultural cluster whose state is not aligned with the external field .",
    "this crossing phase , whose order parameter @xmath76 ( meaning that the largest cluster does not have the size of the system ) , is closely related to the `` orthogonal '' ordered phase reported by gonzlez - avella _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite of the axelrod model in @xmath77 random networks .",
    "contrasting with the conclusions by gonzlez - avella _ et al .",
    "_ , our results indicate that long - range interactions are _ not _ fully required in the axelrod model to form an ordered state whose orientation is not parallel to the external field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we draw a new phase diagram of the axelrod model in regular networks by using the peaks of the size entropy distributions for @xmath70 .",
    "the highest peak at @xmath2 of each @xmath15 distribution in fig .  [ fig:6 ] agrees with the onset of the monocultural - multicultural transition in the corresponding @xmath9 curve .",
    "the second peak at @xmath78 in the entropy distributions is assigned to the multicultural - crossing transition . in the monocultural phase ( colored red ) the state ( @xmath79 )",
    "is aligned with the external field for @xmath80 . in the crossing phase ( colored yellow ) the ordered state ( @xmath81 ) is not parallel to the external field for @xmath82 and @xmath75 . in this region",
    "there is no overlap between the ordered state and the field .",
    "the multicultural phase ( colored blue ) is completely disordered .",
    "in particular , the state in regular networks for @xmath70 is always monocultural for @xmath83 and multicultural for @xmath84 independently of the external field , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ critq ] ) .    finally , in connection with the analysis of the previous section , we remark here that the data for @xmath68 in fig .  [ fig:6 ] provide another good example to show that the cluster size entropy can indicate better the critical value @xmath2 than the order parameter .",
    "one can see that for the cases @xmath85 and @xmath86 the transition onset is better determined by the second peak of the cluster size entropy than by the initial finite value of the order parameter , although this last property displays quite well the transition .",
    "thus far , the cluster size entropy has been hardly used in the analysis of phase transitions . here",
    ", we showed that the cluster size entropy @xmath15 is a valuable tool that can be utilized as a complement of the order parameter @xmath9 . using the cluster entropy",
    ", we were able to both reproduce most of the results previously known for the axelrod model in square networks and find new relevant results .",
    "we showed by a simple analysis that the axelrod model for @xmath62 and @xmath63 belong to a different `` universality '' class . for regular lattices",
    "it was determined an expression that relates @xmath2 and @xmath3 and that defines the asymptotic values of the trait @xmath23 for the presence of multicultural and monocultural phases in the system .",
    "we found a new partially ordered phase for the axelrod model in regular lattices , in which the vector state of the largest cultural cluster is not aligned with the external field or mass media .",
    "this phase is similar to one previously reported for fully connected , scale - free and random networks , and leads to a new cultural trait - field ( @xmath4 ) phase diagram for the axelrod model in regular networks .",
    "the results suggest that long - range interactions are not completely necessary for the existence of an ordered state that is not oriented along the applied field .",
