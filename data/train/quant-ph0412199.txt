    "the main aim of our work is to look for the internal logic of quantum computation @xcite , illustrating the point of view of a hypotetical  internal observer `` who lives inside the black box .",
    "such an observer , introduced in @xcite , can perform ' ' internal \" ( reversible ) measurements in the quantum system .",
    "the idea is that internal measurements give rise to logical assertions @xcite , @xcite , which are then treated following the reflection principle as in basic logic @xcite . by the reflection principle ,",
    "logical connectives are the result of importing some pre - existing metalinguistic links between assertions into the formal language .",
    "we then obtain adequate connectives , corresponding to the _ physical _ links which are present inside the black box .    in @xcite",
    "whe have considered a toy - model quantum computer with one qubit and we have obtained an interpretation of the _ superposition _ of the two basis states in terms of the additive conjunction ",
    "@xmath0 `` ( and , dually , with the additive disjunction  @xmath1 '' ) .",
    "the resulting logic is paraconsistent @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and symmetric , like basic logic .",
    "we remind that in a paraconsistent logic , both the non - contradiction and the excluded middle principle do not hold . here , we introduce a model of two qubits .",
    "this makes it possible to deal with two different physical links occurring between two qubits of the register : _ maximal entanglement _ ( the two qubits are a bell pair ) and _ non entanglement _ ( the two qubits state is separable ) .",
    "to obtain the judgements for the two qubits model , we extend the definition of the internal measurement to the case of two qubits .",
    "we remind that , in a hilbert space , the internal measurement of one qubit is given by a unitary @xmath2 complex matrix @xcite .",
    "in such a model , the judgements are obtained by means of a particular internal measurement , called `` mirror measurement '' @xcite , given by the matrices : @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "we have : @xmath5 so , our mirrors are  quasi - identities `` ; actually , they modify the longitude of the qubit in the bloch sphere , that is , the probability amplitudes : @xmath6 @xmath7 and preserve the  internal truth '' given by the probabilities , since @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for this reason",
    ", we have chosen mirrors matrices to witness the internal truth and the consequent logical judgements , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "we now extend the mirror matrices to @xmath10 . if @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the tensor product @xmath13 given by : @xmath14 is also a mirror matrix .",
    "in fact , the most general state of @xmath10 in the computational basis is : @xmath15 and one has : @xmath16 and again we have : @xmath17 and so on , then probabilities are preserved : @xmath8 ... and so on .    note that , if @xmath18 is one of the bell states @xmath19 , its mirroring is : @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , for the bell s state @xmath21 , we have @xmath22",
    ". then bell states behave as a single particle in the mirroring , since the result has the same form as ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this fact will be shown in sect.4 by sequent calculus .",
    "note finally that there are mirrors of @xmath10 which are not tensor products : actually they are  permutations `` of the above mirror : @xmath23 we could say that they are  entangled mirrors '' and ....",
    "we recall the line of thought followed for the case of the one qubit model . inside the black box , a hypothetical internal observer *",
    "p * is equipped with mirror - matrices and then can perform reversible measurements . outside the black box , instead , an external observer * g * can perform standard quantum measurements , represented by projectors . as explained in @xcite , * g * has a standard quantum logic @xcite .",
    "it is well known that performing a standard quantum measurement in the given basis , e.g. @xmath24 to a qubit @xmath25 , means to apply one of the two projectors @xmath26 or @xmath27 , breaking the superposition and obtaining one of the two basis states .",
    "so the observer * g * can  read `` the value of the qubit as @xmath28 , asserting : ",
    "@xmath28 is true '' or @xmath29 , asserting : ",
    "@xmath29 is true `` .",
    "so , let us suppose that a standard quantum measurement is applied and a result @xmath30 is obtained .",
    "then * g * asserts ' ' @xmath31 is true `` , written as : @xmath32 conversely , denoting by @xmath33 the opposite result , * g * asserts ' ' @xmath33 is true `` , written as : @xmath34 by the no cloning theorem @xcite , after the measurement , * g * can assert _ only one _ of the two .",
    "the same does not happen to the internal observer * p * , who applies a mirror to @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , any mirror is the sum of the two projectors : @xmath36 so that @xmath37 .",
    "hence * p * obtains a _ superposition _ of the two results obtainable by * g*. we write then both the above judgements together : @xmath38 what is a couple of possibilities for *",
    "g * is instead a unique fact for * p * ! by the reflection principle , a connective corresponds to a link between judgements . as in @xcite",
    ", we make the connective ",
    "@xmath0 '' correspond to the above couple , putting @xmath39 then @xmath40 ",
    "@xmath41 is true \" is the judgement put by * p * inside the black box , concerning the value of the qubit @xmath35 .",
    "now , let us consider a two - qubit model , that is a black box equipped with a register @xmath18 of two qubits @xmath42 .",
    "fixed a basis of @xmath10 , e.g. the computational basis @xmath43 , the external observer , who performs a standard quantum measurement in that basis applies one of the four projectors @xmath44 .",
    "let us suppose that she finds an answer @xmath45 for @xmath46 and an answer @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "then she has a register of two classical bits , and her assertion is : @xmath49 where the comma stands for the register link between the two classical bits .",
    "we interpret the link by the multiplicative connective on the right of the sequent , which is called `` par '' , written as `` @xmath50 '' .",
    "`` par '' has the same physical meaning of the tensor product `` times '' , written @xmath51 , which , however , is used in linear logic and basic logic to interpret the comma on the left of the sequent .",
    "then , as in @xcite we put the equation : @xmath52 what are all the possible judgements",
    "? if the measurements of the two qubits are independent , four combinations are possible : @xmath53 and so four judgements are obtainable : @xmath54 this is the case of a pair of unentangled qubits . on the contrary ,",
    "let us consider a bell pair .",
    "in such a case the two measurements are related and so not all combinations are possible : if @xmath55 is a result , then @xmath56 is the only other .",
    "note that * g * is in general unaware of the link existing between @xmath46 and @xmath48 inside the black box , so that the same register link is used outside .",
    "then , in the case of entanglement , two judgements are possible outside : @xmath57 as in the case of one qubit , the external observer can put only one of the possible judgements . again , the judgement of the internal observer is given by a mirror measurement , and mirrors of @xmath10 are obtainable as a linear combination of the four projectors : @xmath58 so * p * , who applies @xmath59 to the register @xmath18 , obtains : @xmath60 that is the superposition of the possible values obtainable outside .",
    "if @xmath18 is not a maximally entangled state , every projector gives a result and the judgement of the internal observer is obtained as a superposition of the four judgements in ( [ quattrogiud ] ) , that is :    @xmath61    if @xmath18 is a bell state , for example @xmath62 , one has @xmath63 . the same holds for the other bell states .",
    "the result of the measurement of a maximally entangled state is the superposition of the two judgements ( [ duegiud ] ) , that is : @xmath64 now , let us consider the internal measurement without any reference to the external one . we know that * p * achieves a superposition @xmath41 measuring @xmath46 and another @xmath65 measuring @xmath48",
    "the two results are linked by two different register links present in the black box , that is non entanglement and maximal entanglement . for non entanglement",
    "we write @xmath66 , while , for maximal entanglement @xmath67 .",
    "the mirror measurement gives the judgements : @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "we put the two reflection principles , writing @xmath70 ( no correlation ) and @xmath71 ( maximum correlation ) for the two corresponding binary connectives : @xmath72 and @xmath73 so we have two kinds of internal judgements concerning our register of two qubits : @xmath74 and @xmath75 as for the states that are nor separable neither maximally entangled , we argue that connectives @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 is a degree of correlation ) , should be introduced , perhaps leading to a kind of fuzzy logic .",
    "of course , the internal judgements ( [ sepgiud ] ) and ( [ entgiud ] ) must be equivalent to the superposition of the external ones ( [ sovrsep ] ) and ( [ sovrent ] ) , that is we have to prove the following equivalence : @xmath79 in the non entangled case , and the equivalence : @xmath80 in the maximally entangled case .    this can be achieved disassembling the judgements and then assembling them the other way around , as we show in the following pair of derivations : @xmath81   { \\infer[\\oslash_1 ] { \\vdash ( a\\ & a^\\perp)\\oslash_1 ( b\\ & b^\\perp)}{\\vdash ( a\\ & a^\\perp)\\bowtie ( b\\ & b^\\perp ) } } { \\infer [ \\&]{\\infer[\\oslash]{\\vdash a , b}{\\vdash a\\oslash b}\\qquad   \\infer[\\oslash]{\\vdash a^\\perp , b^\\perp}{\\vdash a^\\perp\\oslash b^\\perp } }   { \\vdash ( a\\oslash b)\\ & ( a^\\perp \\oslash b^\\perp ) } } \\ ] ] for the maximally entangled case , and @xmath82   { \\infer[\\oslash_0 ] { \\vdash ( a\\ & a^\\perp)\\oslash_0 ( b\\ & b^\\perp)}{\\vdash ( a\\ & a^\\perp)\\asymp ( b\\ & b^\\perp ) } } { \\infer [ \\&]{\\infer[\\oslash]{\\vdash a , b}{\\vdash a\\oslash b}\\qquad   \\infer[\\oslash]{\\vdash a , b^\\perp}{\\vdash a\\oslash b^\\perp}\\qquad \\infer[\\oslash]{\\vdash a^\\perp , b}{\\vdash a^\\perp\\oslash b}\\qquad \\infer[\\oslash]{\\vdash a^\\perp , b^\\perp}{\\vdash a^\\perp\\oslash b^\\perp } }   { \\vdash ( a\\oslash b)\\ & ( a \\oslash b^\\perp)\\ & ( a^\\perp \\oslash b)\\ & ( a^\\perp \\oslash b^\\perp ) } } \\ ] ] for the non entangled case .",
    "we now explain how one must read the above derivations , which are performed by the internal observer .",
    "the key point , once again , is the superposition link .",
    "we remind that , in basic logic , which is a quantum linear logic , the additive connective @xmath0 is obtained putting the following definitional equation : @xmath83 which does not admit any context besides the active formulae @xmath31 and @xmath84 ( visibility of basic logic ) . on the contrary , the same equation in any non - quantum logic",
    "can be written with a context @xmath85 : @xmath86 but , in this case , one would derive distributivity of the multiplicative connective @xmath50 with respect to the additive connective @xmath0 ( e.g. see @xcite ) . inside the black box , we have ( at least ! ) two kinds of distinct links for registers and hence we can deal with two different versions of the equation for @xmath0 : @xmath87 for maximal entanglement , and : @xmath88 for non entanglement .    note that this last equation could be derived from the classical one ! then , of course , a classical logician would derive only the rules for the unentangled case , that correspond to a classical use of the context . on the contrary , in the equation ( [ entsovreq ] )",
    ", we have an odd use of the context , corresponding to entanglement .",
    "notice moreover that , due to visibility , the basic logic equation ( [ basiceq ] ) represents a lower bound for both the equations valid in the black box , that is ( [ entsovreq ] ) and ( [ sepsovreq ] ) .",
    "this means again that the external observer , unaware of the actual kind of correlations present in the black box , but aware of her unawareness , must , as scepticism suggests , suspend judgement . hence , for her judgements , no context at all .",
    "let s us go back and explain the above derivations ( [ entderiv ] ) and ( [ sepderiv ] ) . as we have seen in basic logic , the definitional equations give rise to formation and implicit reflection rules , each one corresponding to a direction of the equivalence .",
    "such rules can be found in the above couple of derivations , which can be read top - down and bottom - up , providing the required equivalences between the judgements .",
    "the premise @xmath89 , used in the definitional equations , is not present in our judgements yet , because its justification inside the black box is under study . in particular , in ( [ entderiv ] ) we have the new rule ",
    "@xmath90 `` , which follows from the definitional equation ( [ entsovreq ] ) , where",
    " @xmath91 '' is for  congruence `` , as equation ( [ entsovreq ] ) resembles a congruence rule .",
    "it shows in logical terms that entanglement is a particular form of superposition . in ( [ sepderiv ] )",
    "the rule  @xmath92 '' ( for `` context '' ) , coming from the definitional equation ( [ sepsovreq ] ) , that is equivalent to the classical equation ( [ classeq ] ) , is a form of a classical @xmath0-rule of sequent calculus .    in our opinion , the derivations , despite their simplicity , are already quite informative for a logical calculus which aims to grasp the efficiency of quantum computation .",
    "in fact , they show how the  quantum parallelism `` , in the entangled case , can be obtained by only one half of the derivation branches !",
    "this is achieved thanks to the rule ",
    "@xmath90 '' . as for the non",
    "entangled case , the rule ",
    "@xmath92 \" relizes a classical parallelism ( superposition without entanglement ) .",
    "note that derivation ( [ entderiv ] ) has the same form of the following one , that shows how the judgements @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be assembled and disassembled in the one qubit case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath95    in this sense we think that a bell s state seen from inside the quantum computer can be assimilated to a single particle . notice that here  inside \" means that the quantum computer is embedded in a non - commutative geometry background @xcite .",
    "in other words a 2-qubits register is a fuzzy sphere with four elementary cells each one encoding a two - qubits string @xmath96 ( see fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) . in the maximally entangled case ,",
    "the fuzzy sphere has two cells , each one with doubled surface area , and encoding the two - bits string @xmath97 and @xmath98 see fig .",
    "the latter situation resembles the case of one qubit , where the fuzzy sphere has two elementary cells ( each one encoding the one bit string @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see fig . ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the fact that a bell s state ( as seen from inside a quantum computer )  pretends `` to be a single particle , while we think it is not , is at the origin of all paradoxes related to entanglement .",
    "for example ,  non - locality '' is just a problem of the external observer , who lives in a local space - time . instead , the bell s state , as seen from inside a quantum computer , lives in a non - local space , which is the fuzzy sphere .",
    "moreover , as far as causality is concerned , let us consider the cut rule : @xmath99 which is a causal relation .",
    "but the cut rule is not admissible inside the black box ( as we have seen in @xcite ) , since it corresponds to a projective measurement performed in the external world .",
    "thus we argue that the usual meaning of causality is absent in the case of a quantum computer on a fuzzy sphere ( internal logic ) .",
    "this is the reason why an external observer , who lives in a causal world , sees as a paradox the non - causal behaviour of a bell s state .",
    "notice that the model of a quantum computer in a non - commutative geometry can be identified with a model of computational loop quantum gravity ( clqg ) @xcite . for",
    "a review on loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) see for example @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to consider a quantum computer at the planck scale .",
    "causality at the planck scale is a very controversial issue , and some authors , like sorkin and collaborators @xcite are inclined to believe in a sort of micro - causality that they discuss in terms of causal sets .",
    "however , the fact is that the light cone at the plank scale might be  smeared `` by the very strong quantum fluctuations of the metric field ( the  quantum foam '' @xcite ) and this would indicate that causality is lost at that scale . at the light of our logical result , i.e. , that the cut rule is not admissible inside the black box , we are now lead to argue that causality is absent at the fundamental scale",
