    "in this article we study the coupling of the free dirac operator with measure - valued potentials developed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to give spectral properties of these couplings and to investigate the phenomenon of confinement .",
    "given @xmath4 , the free dirac operator in @xmath2 is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the family of _ pauli matrices_. although one can take @xmath8 in the definition of @xmath9 , throughout this article we always assume @xmath10 .",
    "the work @xcite contains some results concerning @xmath0 for quite general singular measures @xmath11 in @xmath2 and suitable @xmath12-valued potentials @xmath3 .",
    "however , in that article , most of the interest is focused on the case that @xmath11 is the surface measure on the boundary of a bounded regular domain in @xmath2 , and this is our setting for the present paper . in order to make an understandable exposition of the main results ,",
    "let us first recall the basic ideas used in @xcite .",
    "the ambient hilbert space is @xmath13 with respect to the lebesgue measure , and @xmath9 is defined in the sense of distributions . given a bounded regular domain @xmath14 with boundary @xmath15 and surface measure @xmath11 , in @xcite we find domains @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is an unbounded self - adjoint operator , where @xmath3 is a suitable @xmath12-valued potential .",
    "the construction of @xmath18 relies on the following simple argument : by assumption , @xmath3 is @xmath12-valued .",
    "thus , given @xmath19 , we can write @xmath20 in the sense of distributions for some @xmath21 . moreover , since @xmath22 , we can also write @xmath23 for some @xmath24 . therefore , @xmath25 in the sense of distributions , and so @xmath26 should be the convolution @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a fundamental solution of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 to guarantee that @xmath0 is self - adjoint on @xmath30 , in @xcite we impose some relations between @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the aid of bounded self - adjoint operators @xmath33 .",
    "that is to say , given suitable @xmath34 s , following ( [ intro 1 ] ) we find domains @xmath35 where @xmath0 is self - adjoint .",
    "we consider the potential @xmath3 given by ( [ intro 1 ] ) as a `` generic '' potential since it seems to be prescribed from the begining , i.e. , @xmath20 for all @xmath36 , so @xmath3 is independent of @xmath34 . for an a priori given potential @xmath37 , the key idea in @xcite to construct a domain where @xmath38 is self - adjoint is to find a precise bounded self - adjoint operator @xmath39 so that @xmath40 for all @xmath41 , and the self - adjointness of @xmath38 on @xmath42 follows directly from the one of @xmath0 .",
    "the generic potential @xmath3 given by ( [ intro 1 ] ) reflects the following rough idea : if we know that the gradient of a function @xmath26 has an absolutely continuous part @xmath31 and a singular part @xmath32 supported on @xmath15 ( in our setting , @xmath43 and @xmath22 ) , then @xmath26 must have a jump across @xmath15 , and this jump completely determines the singular part of the gradient ( in our setting , the jump determines the value @xmath44 ) . for a given potential @xmath37 ,",
    "one manages to define a suitable domain @xmath18 such that , for any @xmath19 , the singular part which comes from the gradient on the jump of @xmath26 across @xmath15 agrees with @xmath45 .",
    "as outlined above , in @xcite we show that any @xmath46 has non - tangential boundary values @xmath47 when we approach to @xmath15 from @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "this enables us to consider , for example , the electrostatic shell potential @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "following the argument above , we construct a domain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is self - adjoint for all @xmath54 .",
    "other similar potentials are also treated in @xcite .    at this point",
    "a remark is in order . in @xcite",
    "( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) the author provides , in a very general framework , all self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators obtained by restricting a self - adjoint operator @xmath55 with domain @xmath56 to a dense ( and closed with respect to the graph norm ) subspace @xmath57 .",
    "typically , @xmath55 is a differential operator and @xmath58 is the kernel of some trace operator along a null set . in particular , @xcite can be used to provide all the domains where @xmath0 is self - adjoint and , in this sense , some of the results in @xcite follow from the ones in @xcite . however , as regards applications , we make use of some explicit layer potentials on @xmath15 derived from our approach in @xcite which turn out to be very fruitful both in the description of the domains and in the study of the properties of the couplings under consideration .    concerning the results in this article , in section [ s spec ] we show a general criterion for the existence of eigenvalues in @xmath59 for @xmath0 , namely proposition [ spec p1 ] , which has strong connections with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5 ) .",
    "this criterion relates the existence of eigenvalues , which is a problem in the whole @xmath2 , with a spectral property of certain bounded operators in @xmath12 , which is a problem settled exclusively on @xmath15 .",
    "afterwards , we show some applications to the case of electrostatic shell potentials @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , theorem [ spec t1 ] shows that @xmath53 and @xmath61 have the same eigenvalues in @xmath59 for all @xmath62 , which is a special case of the more general isospectral transformation , and that @xmath53 has no eigenvalues in @xmath59 if @xmath63 is too big or too small .",
    "this is an interesting feature , since it shows that there are lower and upper thresholds on the possible values of @xmath63 in order to have non - trivial eigenvalues in @xmath59 for @xmath53 , unlike what happens to the coupling of @xmath9 with similar potentials ( see remark [ threshold ] ) .",
    "theorem [ symm a -a ] is another consequence of the general criterion , where we show that , under a symmetry assumption on @xmath11 , @xmath53 has an eigenvalue @xmath64 if and only if @xmath65 has @xmath66 as an eigenvalue . for completeness",
    ", we also show in theorem [ spec t2 ] that if @xmath67 is connected then @xmath53 has no eigenvalues in @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "section [ s sphere ] is devoted to the spectral study of @xmath53 when @xmath15 is the sphere @xmath69 our interest is to characterize the eigenvalues finding sharp constants of some appropriately chosen inequalities . in principle",
    ", this is far from obvious for dirac hamiltonians because they are not semibounded operators .",
    "however , this procedure has been successfully used in @xcite with hamiltonians with coulombic singularities . in that case , the sharp constants appear as strictly positive lower bounds for the absolute value of the commutator of two operators , being @xmath9 one of them .",
    "therefore , this approach can be seen as another use of the uncertainty principle . in the current article",
    "we proceed in the same vein and we give an uncertainty principle that concerns some @xmath70 bounded operators also related to @xmath9 . in theorem [ thmineq ] we obtain a sharp inequality on @xmath71 which turns out to be connected to the eigenvalues of @xmath53 . for its proof , we strongly use the classical spherical harmonics , so a generalization to other surfaces @xmath15 seems an interesting and challenging question . as a consequence of the above - mentioned inequality , we recover a well - known sharp lower bound for the @xmath72-dimensional riesz transform on the sphere ( see corollary [ riesz ] and @xcite ) . in lemma [ eigenfunction ]",
    "we provide a specific criterion ( based on proposition [ spec p1 ] ) to generate eigenvectors of @xmath53 .",
    "section [ further com ] contains some comments on the relation between the uncertainty principle and the eigenvectors of @xmath53 , positive results on the existence of eigenvalues , and an open question ( as far as we know ) and some consequences of an affirmative answer",
    ".    finally , in section [ s confinement ] we deal with the confinement phenomenon on regular surfaces . roughly speaking",
    ", one says that an @xmath12-valued potential @xmath3 generates confinement with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath15 if the particles modelized by the evolution operator associated to @xmath0 never cross @xmath15 over time .",
    "that is , if a function @xmath73 verifies the equation @xmath74 and @xmath75 is supported in @xmath48 , that @xmath3 generates confinement means that @xmath76 is supported in @xmath48 for all @xmath77 , so @xmath15 becomes impenetrable for the particles .",
    "similarly to section [ s spec ] , in section [ s confinement ] we first show a general criterion on @xmath0 to generate confinement , namely theorem [ conf t1 ] .",
    "this criterion is stated in terms of an algebraic property of certain bounded operators in @xmath12 , so as before we convert a problem in the whole @xmath2 to a problem exclusively settled in @xmath15 .",
    "an application to electrostatic and lorentz scalar shell potentials is also shown .",
    "in particular , in theorem [ conf appl ] we prove that , for @xmath78 , the potential @xmath79 generates confinement if and only if @xmath80 . this",
    "was already known for the case of the sphere ( see @xcite ) , and we generalize it to sufficiently regular surfaces . for the reader only interested on confinement , we mention that section [ s confinement ] can be read independently of sections [ s spec ] and [ s sphere ] .",
    "finally , we also want to recall @xcite , where the authors studied the confinement phenomenon for singular perturbations of general self - adjoint hamiltonian operators .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , although all the applications in this article are concerned to the potentials @xmath60 and @xmath81 above - mentioned , the general criteria stated in proposition [ spec p1 ] and theorem [ conf t1 ] can be used as a first step to study the spectrum and confinement for the coupling of @xmath9 with other shell potentials . in a sense , once a potential @xmath37 is given , one must find the suitable operator @xmath34 ( mentioned in the beginning of the introduction ) so that @xmath40 for all @xmath82 , and then one must check the criteria for that specific @xmath34 .",
    "since this article is a continuation of the study developed in @xcite , we assume that the reader is familiar with the notation , methods and results in there . however , in this section we recall some basic rudiments for the sake of completeness .    given a positive borel measure @xmath83 in @xmath2 , set @xmath84 and denote by @xmath85 and @xmath86 the standard scalar product and norm in @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "we write @xmath91 or @xmath92 interchangeably to denote the identity operator on @xmath87 .",
    "we say that @xmath83 is @xmath93-dimensional if there exists @xmath94 such that @xmath95 for all @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "we denote by @xmath98 the lebesgue measure in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the boundary of a bounded lipschitz domain @xmath14 , let @xmath11 and @xmath58 be the surface measure and outward unit normal vector field on @xmath15 respectively , and set @xmath49 , so @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath11 is 2-dimensional .",
    "since we are not interested in optimal regularity assumptions , for the sequel we assume that @xmath15 is of class @xmath100 ( see remark [ r regularity ] for the lipschitz case ) .",
    "finally , we introduce the auxiliary space of measures @xmath101    observe that @xmath9 , which is symmetric and initially defined in @xmath102 ( @xmath103-valued functions in @xmath2 which are @xmath104 and with compact support ) , can be extended by duality to the space of distributions with respect to the test space @xmath102 and , in particular , it can be defined on @xmath105 .",
    "the following lemma is concerned with the resolvent of @xmath9 , which will be very useful for the results below . as usual",
