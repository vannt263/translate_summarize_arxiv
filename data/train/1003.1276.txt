    "the yet elusive higgs boson is the primary target of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "but , lhc is also expected to reveal a new ruler of the tera - electron - volt ( tev ) territories .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) has so far been remarkably successful in explaining physics up to a few hundred gev energy scale .",
    "but theoretical inconsistencies of the sm ( like , gauge hierarchy problem ) and experimental requirements ( like , a candidate to account for the dark matter of the universe ) suggest that there are good reasons to believe that new physics beyond the sm is just around the corner crying out for verification . among the different possibilities , supersymmetry and extra dimension",
    "stand out as the two leading candidates for dictating terms in the tev regime .",
    "these two apparently distinct classes of scenarios cover a wide variety of more specific models . the usual practice from a bottom - up",
    "approach is to attach an ` either / or ' tag on supersymmetry and extra dimension , as if the presence of one excludes the other .",
    "a more careful thought would reveal that the relationship between these two is _ not necessarily _ mutually exclusive .",
    "in fact , the presence of higher dimensions is a common feature of any fundamental theory valid at high scale .",
    "we will get back to this issue a little later . for the moment , to put things into perspective , we recapitulate the chronological evolution of the extra dimensional scenarios without invoking supersymmetry _ a priori_. we restrict our discussion to the flat space scenarios , as we are not pursuing the warped path in this paper besides mentioning it as an aside .",
    "flat extra dimensions were first studied @xcite in a scenario where gravity propagates in a millimeter ( mm ) size compact space dimension , with the sm particles confined to a 4d brane . the motive was to bring down the fundamental planck scale to about a tev .",
    "subsequently , it was conceived that the brane where the sm particles live may actually have a very small size , like @xmath10 cm @xmath11 , leading to the concept of a ` fat brane ' @xcite . in the context of the present paper ,",
    "we stick to the fat brane scenario .",
    "_ what are the experimental bounds on the fatness of such a brane , more precisely , on the radius of compactification ( @xmath12 ) _ ?",
    "for universal extra dimension ( ued ) models @xcite , in which _ all _ the sm particles access the extra dimensional bulk , a safe estimate is @xmath13 gev .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath14 of the muon @xcite , flavor changing neutral currents @xcite , @xmath15 decay @xcite , the @xmath16 parameter @xcite , and hadron collider studies @xcite reveal that @xmath17 gev .",
    "consideration of @xmath4 , however , implies a somewhat tighter bound ( @xmath18 gev @xcite ) .",
    "methods to decipher its signals from the lhc data have recently been discussed too @xcite . on the other hand , in the non - universal scenario where both the sm gauge bosons and the higgs boson propagate in the bulk but",
    "the fermions are confined to a 4d brane @xcite , @xmath19 can not be below @xmath20 tev @xcite .",
    "the reason behind the difference in constraints is the following .",
    "the kk parity , defined by @xmath21 for the @xmath22th kk label , is conserved in ued , while it is not a good symmetry in the non - universal scenario . as a result , while in the non - universal models kk states can mediate many processes at tree level yielding strong constraints , in the ued model , thanks to the kk parity , kk states appear only inside a loop leading to milder constraints .",
    "_ in any case , in the presence of supersymmetry , all those analyses need to be modified with more parameters , which would expectedly lead to a set of more relaxed bounds on @xmath19_.    _ now , what is the motivation of studying a tev scale ( or , a fat brane ) extra dimension scenario _ ?",
    "the implications of such models have been investigated from the perspective of string theory , phenomenology , cosmology / astrophysics and high energy experiments .",
    "such models provide a cosmologically stable dark matter candidate @xcite , trigger electroweak symmetry breaking successfully through a composite higgs @xcite , address the fermion mass hierarchy problem from a different point of view @xcite tev due to large flavor - changing neutral currents and cp violation @xcite . ] , and stimulate power law renormalization group ( rg ) running yielding a lower ( few tens of a tev ) gauge coupling ( near-)unification scale @xcite . besides",
    ", the running of neutrino mixing angles generated from effective majorana mass operator in a 5d set - up has been studied both in non - supersymmetric @xcite and supersymmetric @xcite contexts .    _ but , what is the advantage of supersymmetrizing it ? _ we argue that supersymmetry and extra dimension need not always be seen as _ two _ new physics considered simultaneously .",
    "in fact , they may nicely complement each other in _ some situations _ through mutual requirements .",
    "this can be seen as follows :    1 .",
    "from a top - down approach , string theory provides a rationale behind linking supersymmetry and extra dimension .",
    "the string models are intrinsically extra dimensional , and more often than not contain supersymmetry as an integral part .",
    "that said , we must also admit that establishing a rigorous connection between a _ realistic _ low energy supersymmetric model with string theory is still a long shot , though a lot of efforts have already been put in that direction @xcite .",
    "the higher dimensional field theories are non - renormalizable , and computation of quantum corrections in such scenarios require the existence of a uv completion .",
    "superstring theories , which contain supersymmetry , provide the main hope in this context .",
    "in fact , a joint rle of ` partial supersymmetry ' ( broken at very high scale ) and warped extra dimension / compositeness has been envisaged from ads / cft point of view to account for both the ` little ' and the ` big ' hierarchies @xcite .",
    "3 .   even after embedding the sm in an extra dimensional set - up , the scalar potential remains unstable under quantum correction .",
    "supersymmetrization stabilizes it and ameliorates the hierarchy problem .",
    "it is interesting to note that by admitting chiral fermions and their scalar partners in the same multiplet tacitly provides a rationale behind treating the higgs boson as an elementary object .",
    "an elementary higgs can be perfectly accommodated in a flat extra dimensional set - up . as a corollary , the upper limit on the lightest supersymmetric",
    "neutral higgs is relaxed beyond the 4d upper limit of 135 gev due to the presence of the kk towers of top / stop chiral multiplets , and the _ hitherto _ disfavored low @xmath23 region can be resurrected @xcite .",
    "each 4d supersymmetric scenario has its own supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "the origin of this mechanism may be linked to the existence of extra dimension .",
    "in fact , one of the earliest motivations of a tev scale fat brane was to relate the scale of 4d supersymmetry breaking with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "keeping these in mind , we outline the formalism of a 5d supersymmetric model in an @xmath24 orbifold which contains the 4d supersymmetric states as zero modes . in section [ 5dmssm ] ,",
    "we state our assumptions leading to the construction of the 5d model and comment on supersymmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly write down the particle content and their 5d lagrangian and illustrate the kk decompositions of the different 5d fields . in section [ beta ] , we derive the beta functions of the gauge and yukawa couplings as well as those of the different soft supersymmetry breaking parameters _",
    "diagram by diagram _ , pointing out how they are all modified from their 4d values due to the presence of kk states . in section",
    "[ numerical ] , we discuss the numerical effects of rg running and highlight the reason behind the differences between the 4d and 5d scenarios .",
    "we also point out under what conditions we can ensure electroweak symmetry breaking . in section [ m0mhalf ] , we exhibit the numerical impact of rg running through plots showing constraints in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane .",
    "we standardize our numerical codes by reproducing the known 4d plots before encoding the necessary alterations for producing the new plots pertaining to 5d supersymmetry .",
    "this also enables us to compare and contrast the 4d and 5d allowed / disallowed zones .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] , we showcase the essential features we have learnt from this analysis .",
    "we highlight the salient features of supersymmetry in higher dimension and outline below the various assumptions that lead to a calculable phenomenological framework .    1 .   we consider a 5d flat space time metric .",
    "the 5th dimension is compactified on a @xmath25 orbifold .",
    "orbifolding is necessary to reproduce chiral zero mode fermions as a 5d theory is vector - like .",
    "we embed the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in this higher dimensional set - up ( several consequences of such embedding , mainly the effects on gauge and yukawa couplings evolution , have been studied in @xcite ) . from a 4d point of view",
    "this leads to a tower of kk states .",
    "the massless sector corresponds to the 4d mssm states .",
    "3 .   since in 5d bulk",
    "the fermion representation is vectorial , the two - component spinor @xmath26 that generates 4d supersymmetry will in 5d be accompanied by its chiral conjugate mirror @xmath27 .",
    "thus a @xmath2 supersymmetry in 5d corresponds to two different @xmath2 supersymmetry , or equivalently , a @xmath1 supersymmetry from a 4d perspective .",
    "in fact , all members of a given kk mode must fall into a valid representation of @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "in fact , each 4d supermultiplet is augmented by new chiral conjugate states and together they form a hypermultiplet .",
    "we are talking about a massive representation of supersymmetry , where the supersymmetry preserving dirac mass plays the rle of central charge for @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "this charge is not renormalized , as a consequence of which the bulk hypermultiplets do not receive any wave - function renormalization supersymmetry it turns out that @xmath28 , which is analogous to @xmath29 for @xmath30 supersymmetry . here",
    "@xmath31 is the dirac mass ( central charge ) and @xmath32 is gauge coupling , while @xmath12 and @xmath33 are labels for renormalized and bare quantities .",
    "since the dirac mass of @xmath1 hypermultiplets appears on the right - hand side of the anti - commutation relation of the conserved supersymmetry charges , this mass can not be renormalized .",
    "this is intertwined with the observation that only those terms are renormalized which can be written as integrals over all superspace volume .",
    "the kinetic term of @xmath1 hypermultiplets can not be written as any such integral ( see discussions and related earlier references in @xcite . ] @xcite .",
    "we observe that this @xmath1 non - renormalization has serious numerical consequences in rg evolution of parameters .",
    "the most notable effect is the blowing up of the yukawa couplings into the non - perturbative regime around 18 tev , which we will take to be the cutoff of our theory .",
    "this is below the scale of perturbative gauge coupling unification , which is around 30 tev .",
    "recall that in 5d we encounter power law running which results in early ( compared to 4d ) unification .",
    "we allow the gauge and the higgs multiplets access the 5d bulk .",
    "thus far what we said is nothing but a supersymmetrization of ued . only the matter multiplets make the difference . in the ued framework , _ all _ sm particles access the bulk , and thus even though",
    "there are two fixed points , there is no brane .",
    "one could as well have kept some or all of the fermion generations in a brane at a fixed point ; the difference would be that the scenario would cease to be universal . in the present supersymmetric context",
    "too we have the freedom of keeping some or all of the matter multiplets at an orbifold fixed point . we note that unless we confine at least two generations of matter multiplets on a brane , the requirement of _ perturbative _",
    "gauge coupling unification leads to a constraint @xmath34 gev @xcite , spoiling its relevance for lhc . on the other hand ,",
    "unless we keep the third family of matter multiplet in the bulk we can not ensure electroweak breaking . in view of the above",
    ", we let the third generation matter multiplet access the bulk , but fix the first two generations at the @xmath35 brane .",
    "@xmath1 supersymmetry forbids yukawa interaction in the 5d bulk as this interaction involves odd ( three ) number of _ chiral _ multiplets .",
    "therefore , we localize yukawa interaction at the orbifold fixed point where the supersymmetry corresponds to @xmath2 . 7 .",
    "now we come to the important question as how we break the residual @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "different ideas have been advanced for its realization .",
    "one way is to break it by the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite in which fermions and bosons satisfy different periodic conditions over the compactified dimension .",
    "explicit realizations towards this using a tev - scale orbifold can be found in @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach was to break the residual supersymmetry by a second compactification on an orbifold with two reflection symmetries , viz .",
    "@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this can be viewed as a discrete version of the scherk - schwarz mechanism .",
    "both these scenarios yield soft masses which are uv insensitive due to the non - local nature of supersymmetry breaking . from a completely different viewpoint",
    ", supersymmetry breaking may be infused from the brane - bulk interface @xcite , or transmitted from a distant brane @xcite , or arisen from a gaugino mediation set - up @xcite ( possibly with a much lower cutoff than @xmath37 gev ) , or triggered by some completely unknown brane dynamics , for example , by a spurion @xmath38-term vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "+ in the context of the present analysis , we keep the exact mechanism of the @xmath2 brane supersymmetry breaking _",
    "unspecified_. we assume that the supersymmetry breaking scale is of the order of the inverse radius of compactification , for example @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an @xmath41 dimensionless parameter .",
    "our main goal is the following _ : just like in the conventional but constrained version of 4d supersymmetry one starts with a common scalar and a common gaugino mass at high scale ( e.g. the gut scale ) and then run them down using the mssm beta functions to find the weak scale spectrum , we do exactly the same here by assuming a common scalar mass ( @xmath5 ) and a common gaugino mass ( @xmath6 ) at low cutoff scale ( 18 tev ) and follow the running using the kk beta functions through successive kk thresholds to obtain the weak scale parameters . by adopting a phenomenological approach , we scan @xmath5 and @xmath6 over a set of values @xmath39 , with @xmath40 varying in the range @xmath42 to @xmath43 and @xmath19 fixed at @xmath43 tev .      as mentioned in the introduction , from a 4d perspective the kk towers of matter and gauge fields rearrange in the form of @xmath1 hypermultiplets .",
    "a judicious choice of @xmath44 parity of the 5d fields allows us to break the @xmath1 supersymmetry to @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "we briefly review below the multiplet structures of the fields following the prescription suggested in @xcite .",
    "the 5d super yang - mills theory contains a 5-vector gauge field , a 4-component dirac gaugino and a real scalar .",
    "when dimensionally reduced to 4d , the gauge field splits into a 4-vector and a scalar , the gaugino splits into 2 majorana gauginos , and we still have the real scalar previously mentioned .",
    "all these fit into a vector multiplet and a chiral multiplet in @xmath2 language .",
    "if we represent the @xmath1 vector supermultiplet by @xmath45 , the 4-vector gauge field by @xmath46 , the gauginos by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and define a complex scalar field @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the 5d real scalar and @xmath51 is the 5th component of the 5-vector field , then one can schematically represent the 5d vector supermultiplet as @xmath52 from a 4d perspective ( where the compactified 5th coordinate @xmath53 is just a label ) , and in the @xmath2 language , one can visualize the vector hypermultiplet by a vector multiplet @xmath54 ( first column ) and a chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation by @xmath55 ( second column ) : @xmath56 the @xmath44 parity of @xmath45 is so chosen that the @xmath54 contains a zero mode , but @xmath55 does not have any zero mode .    the gauge invariant action may be written as ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58,\\ ] ] where the @xmath59 is the field strength superfield corresponding to @xmath60 .      from the @xmath2 perspective , the @xmath1 hypermultiplet splits into two chiral multiplets .",

    "we have fixed @xmath118 tev .",
    "the power law running of the gauge and yukawa couplings has been discussed in @xcite for the non - supersymmetric scenario and in @xcite for the supersymmetric case .",
    "as far as the higgs multiplets are concerned , there is a crucial difference between our model and that considered in @xcite . in our scenario",
    "there are separate up- and down - type higgs hypermultiplets - see eq .",
    "( [ huhd - hyper ] ) . inside each hypermultiplet",
    "only the left column with label ( @xmath74 ) is @xmath44 even and its scalar zero mode receives a vev , whereas the right column with label ( @xmath12 ) is projected out . in other words ,",
    "the hypermultiplet @xmath61 contains the vev @xmath119 and , similarly , @xmath62 contains @xmath120 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite contains a single hypermultiplet , each column of which has a zero mode , one to be identified with the up - type chiral multiplet which contains the vev @xmath119 , and the other to be identified with the down - type containing @xmath120 .",
    "while our approach constitutes a straightforward generalization of @xmath61 and @xmath62 from chiral multiplets to hypermultiplets , the choice made in @xcite requires non - trivial boundary conditions .",
    "these two different assumptions lead to significant numerical differences . in our approach ,",
    "the gauge couplings converge to one another but actually do not meet at a single point , while in @xcite the gauge couplings do meet at a point .",
    "the difference in the number of kk scalar excitations makes the difference between the two approaches .    indeed , both gauge and yukawa couplings exhibit power law running due to summation over the kk states as one crosses the energy thresholds . as we have mentioned in section [ 5dmssm ] ,",
    "keeping the first two matter generations confined at the brane ensures that the couplings remain perturbative even with @xmath19 as low as 1 tev . starting from their lep - measured values at the weak scale , as we extrapolate the gauge couplings using the kk beta functions we observe that the three couplings approach very close to one another near 32 tev , but they do not actually meet at any point , as mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "a crucial point of immense numerical significance is that on account of the special @xmath1 bulk non - renormalization , the third generation matter hypermultiplet kept in the bulk does not receive any wave - function renormalization from the gauge hypermultiplet , which we have illustrated below eq .",
    "( [ nonrenorm ] ) . as an important consequence of this",
    "the yukawa coupling blows up to large ( non - perturbative ) values around @xmath121 18 tev , which we therefore take to be the effective cutoff of our theory .",
    "we assume that at the highest scale @xmath122 tev of our theory , i.e. just before the yukawa couplings blow up , all scalar masses unify to @xmath5 and all gaugino masses to @xmath6 .",
    "our high scale parameters are then @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the gaugino mass running is governed by the evolution of gauge couplings . since gauge couplings _ nearly _ meet around 32 tev , the gaugino masses tend to converge also at that scale .",
    "but in the present context , as mentioned before , we forced the gaugino masses to unify at 18 tev . recall that in 5d the running is short but fast ( power law ) ,",
    "but in 4d it is long and slow ( logarithmic ) .",
    "this leads to a general expectation that starting from a given high scale value , the low scale predictions would be similar in 4d and 5d .",
    "but since we forcibly unified the gaugino masses in our set - up , earlier than otherwise expected , we obtain a somewhat different set of low scale values .",
    "the gaugino mass scaling in 5d is shown in fig .",
    "[ gauge ] , while in the inset is displayed the 4d running .",
    "a rough comparison of the weak scale ratios of the three gaugino masses is the following : @xmath125 if @xmath12-parity remains conserved , the lightest neutralino remains the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , only that its mass is heavier than what is expected in the standard 4d scenario - see eq .",
    "( [ gauginom ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ rewsb ] shows the running of the soft scalar masses .",
    "the large top quark yukawa coupling continues to play a crucial rle as in 4d .",

    "we have ignored kk mixing which , we believe , would not affect our main qualitative features . ] . the relatively _ compressed _ spectrum in 5d , as expressed through eqs .",
    "( [ gauginom ] ) and ( [ scalarm ] ) , is indicative of a lesser fine - tuning compared to the conventional mssm .    during power law",
    "running we ensure that radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry does happen at the desired scale .",
    "just like in 4d , only @xmath127 turns negative while all other scalars remain positive .",
    "again , the large top quark yukawa coupling drives this phase transition . a point to note is that _ unless _ we keep the third generation matter in the bulk , electroweak symmetry would never break radiatively in our class of models .",
    "furthermore , we had to take in 5d a factor 1 to 3 larger ( than 4d ) value of @xmath7 at the cutoff scale .",
    "for our numerical estimates we go through the following steps :    1 .",
    "we scan @xmath5 and @xmath6 through the range @xmath129/r$ ] .",
    "we fix @xmath130 and take both positive and negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "our cutoff is 18 tev , which is the scale where the yukawa couplings blow up to non - perturbative values .",
    "we use one loop rg equations as displayed in section [ beta ] . to obtain the weak scale parameters we follow the logarithmic evolution like in the 4d desert , but now using different beta functions for different energy intervals separated by successive kk thresholds - see eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "so , operationally , power law running is treated by taking _ many _ logs .",
    "2 .   for each input combination",
    ", we perform a consistency check to ensure correct electroweak symmetry breaking , and accept only those inputs which admit this phenomenon .",
    "we then feed the weak scale spectrum into the code micromegas @xcite , and using this software package calculate the dark matter density ( @xmath131 ) , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "since we consider @xmath118 tev , even the lightest kk states are somewhat heavier than the lighter section of the zero mode spectra . as a result , without any significant numerical compromise we neglect the direct loop contributions of the virtual kk particles , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137@xmath138 are all finite _ upto one loop _ in ued or its supersymmetric version thanks to the kk number conservation at the _ tree _ level lagrangian , in scenarios containing brane - bound fermions one encounters a uv sensitivity even at one loop @xcite .",
    "a sensible uv completion is needed to counter this .",
    "see also @xcite and footnote 2 of this paper . ] .",
    "in other words , the kk effects feed into the calculation of low energy spectra _ via _ power law running , but after that we rely on the standard 4d computations encoded in micromegas .",
    "this approximation is good enough for our purpose .",
    "we compare the predictions of the above observables with their experimental values / constraints , and translate the information into the inclusion / exclusion plots ( figs .",
    "[ momh1 ] and [ momh2 ] ) in the @xmath139 plane .",
    "the 4d plots have been reproduced to serve as a guide to the eyes for capturing the 5d subtleties .",
    "we note that our 4d plots are in agreement with the ones in the existing literature , e.g. with @xcite .",
    "we highlight only the major differences between the 4d and 5d models that appear on the @xmath5@xmath6 plane .    1 .",
    "we assume that @xmath12-parity is conserved . in the 4d scenario",
    "the lightest neutralino is the most likely candidate for an lsp . in the 5d model",
    "the situation is somewhat tricky . indeed , the 4d lsp is still an lsp here which is the zero mode neutralino . besides , _",
    "if _ the kk parity remains conserved , then the @xmath140 mode of photon tower , namely @xmath141 , and its supersymmetric partner @xmath142 are also stable dark matter candidates . however , the kk parity is unlikely to respected by the brane - bulk interaction . in our numerical analysis",
    ", we have treated the zero mode lsp as the dark matter candidate .",
    "we have taken a @xmath143 range of the five year average of wmap dark matter density ( @xmath144 ) @xcite .",
    "we raise a caution here that _ if _ kk parity remains conserved and we have two _ more _ dark matter candidates , as mentioned above , then the edge of the allowed band arising from the lower limit of @xmath131 would be further stretched .",
    "note further that in the 5d case there is a slight broadening of the wmap allowed strip compared to 4d .",
    "this happens because of a combined effect of eqs .",
    "( [ gauginom ] ) and ( [ scalarm ] ) leading to a reduced sensitivity to @xmath6 variation .",
    "the region where the lightest neutralino satisfies the dark matter constraints extends to a _ higher _ value of @xmath6 in 5d compared to 4d .",
    "what matters most in this context is the mass difference between the chargino and the lightest neutralino , i.e. @xmath145 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ gauginom ] ) that starting from a given @xmath6 this difference is smaller in 5d than in 4d .",
    "this explains the shift of the band to the right side .",
    "we have taken @xmath146 @xcite , and @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "there is nothing much to distinguish between 4d and 5d from these two observables .",
    "we have _ not _ included the _ direct _ loop effects of the virtual kk states for any of the weak scale observables . for @xmath148 tev or more , for processes like muon anomalous magnetic moment or @xmath149 ,",
    "such effects are numerically negligible , but _ only _ for the higgs mass it makes a difference . in figs .",
    "[ momh1 ] and [ momh2 ] , the entire region to the left of the line marked with @xmath150 gev which looks otherwise disfavored will be resurrected if we include the kk loop correction to the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "we reiterate once again that supersymmetry and extra dimension are interestingly intertwined both from theoretical and phenomenological perspectives . the presence of extra dimensions is an essential part of any high scale fundamental theory , and supersymmetry is quite often an integral component of such theories .",
    "supersymmetry , on the other hand , provides a sensible uv completion of the extra dimensional models .",
    "the connection between supersymmetry and extra dimension is further strengthened by the consideration that the origin of supersymmetry breaking may reside in extra dimension . in a general class of scenarios",
    "in which tev - size soft masses are generated at a relatively low cutoff scale ( like 20 - 30 tev ) with intermediate resonances , one can find a common ground where our analysis will be applicable .    the logarithmic running in 4d from 100 gev to @xmath37 gev is replaced in 5d by fast power law running on a shorter interval from 100 gev to about 30 tev thanks to the kk states .",
    "this is a feature of extra dimension . what is technically / operationally special about 5d supersymmetry is that it provides a special @xmath1 non - renormalization that forces us to consider an early cutoff ( @xmath151 18 tev ) .",
    "the constraints in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane have been placed for the _ first time _ in this paper .",
    "the ratio @xmath152 is higher in 5d compared to 4d .",
    "for this reason the _ allowed _ region in the 5d plot extends to _ larger _ values of @xmath6 compared to the 4d plot .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath19 could in principle be much smaller , e.g. a few hundred gev , than our reference value of 1 tev .",
    "in fact , the first kk excitations of sm particles could very well be lighter than zero mode superpartners .",
    "it is neither our intention , nor it is possible within the scope of the present paper , to distinguish the two different options .",
    "two issues require further studies beyond the scope of the present paper : ( i ) besides the lightest neutralino ( the usual 4d lsp ) , _ if _ kk parity remains conserved , there may be two other candidates of dark matter in this model .",
    "one is @xmath141 , the @xmath140 level photon , and the other is its superpartner @xmath142 .",
    "although brane - bulk interface is likely to frustrate kk parity conservation , yet for the sake of completeness one should study the _ combined effects _ of all three dark matter candidates .",
    "( ii ) it will also be interesting to revisit the lower limit on @xmath19 in a _",
