    "in the last years , it has become clear that gravitational microlensing , initially developed to search for machos in our galactic halo and near the galactic disk can be used to infer the presence of extrasolar planets orbiting around lens stars ( see the review by @xcite ) .    as shown by @xcite",
    "the planet presence effect on the light curve in a microlensing event towards the galactic bulge is generally a short duration perturbation to the standard microlensing curve .",
    "these deviations last from a few hours to some days ( depending on the planet mass ) and can occur relatively frequently , even for rather small mass planets .",
    "indeed , the microlensing technique is sensitive to planets in a rather large range of masses , from jupiter - like planets down to earth - like ones @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that there is a significant probability to detect planets around stars in the galactic disk that act as microlenses by magnifying the light of observed stars in the galactic bulge . until now , the detection of eight extrasolar planets has been reported by using the microlensing technique @xcite .",
    "we remind that the masses of three of them ( @xmath2 3 , 5 and 13 @xmath3 ) are at the lower bound of the detected planetary mass range . indeed , more than 300 extrasolar planets discovered until now by radial velocity , transit and direct imaging methods are biased towards large mass ( jupiter - like ) planets @xcite",
    ". however , radial velocity searches by ground based experiments have now provided extrasolar planets with @xmath4 @xcite , whereas space based observations are expected to detect many earth - mass planets ( with kepler satellite ) and many earth - size planets ( with corot spececraft ) .",
    "a further advantage of the microlensing is that it works better for large distance of the source star , since the optical depth increases by increasing the distance , as one can already see from the @xcite approach .",
    "this gives the opportunity to detect planetary systems at distances much larger with respect to those accessible by the other tecniques and even in other galaxies such as m31 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case , however , the source stars are not resolved by ground based telescopes - a situation referred to as `` pixel - lensing '' @xcite - and only bright sources ( i.e. giant stars with large radii ) , sufficiently magnified , can give rise to detectable microlensing events @xcite .",
    "this implies that finite size effects , leading to smaller planetary deviations in pixel - lensing light - curves with respect to microlensing towards the galactic bulge , can not be neglected ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "usually , highly magnified events arise when the source and lens stars align very closely . in this case",
    "there is the largest chance of observing the perturbations in the light curves induced by planets @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for large mass planets , for which the planetary signals are not strongly suppressed by finite size effects , whereas for low mass planets , the planetary signals may remain detectable during other phases of the event @xcite .    until now , only about a dozen microlensing events have been observed towards m31 by the point - agape @xcite and mega collaborations @xcite . only in one case a deviation from the standard paczyski shape has been observed and attributed to a secondary component orbiting the lens star @xcite . however , new observational campaigns towards m31 have been undertaken @xcite and hopefully a few planets might be detected in the future , providing a better statistics on the masses and orbital radii of extrasolar planets .",
    "it is in fact expected , and supported by observations and numerical simulations , that almost any star has at least a planet orbiting around it ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in other words , as also suggested by @xcite , the rate of single lens events towards m31 may suffer of a strong contamination of binary lensing events , most of which are expected to be due to extrasolar planets .",
    "therefore , it is important to address the question of how to extract information about planetary lensing events , occurring in m31 , from the observed microlensing light curves . since planetary perturbations last from hours to a few days",
    ", a monitoring program with suitable sampling must be realised , in order to avoid missing these perturbations .",
    "the feasibility of such research program has been already explored by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have considered the possibility to detect planets in m31 bulge by using the observations taken from the angstrom collaboration @xcite with a global network of 2 m class telescopes and a monitoring frequency of about five observations per day .",
    "the analysis for planet detection , however , has been performed by using a fixed configuration of the underlying paczyski light curve .    in the present work , instead , by using a monte carlo ( mc ) approach @xcite we explore the possibility of detecting extrasolar planets in pixel - lensing observations towards m31 , by considering the multi - dimensional space of parameters for both lensing and planetary systems .",
    "taking into account the finite source effects and the limb darkening and using the residual method we can select the simulated light curves that show significant deviations with respect to a paczyski like light curve , modified by finite source effects .",
    "the advantage of the monte carlo approach is that of allowing us a complete characterization of the sample of microlensing events for which the planetary deviations are more likely to be detected .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the basics of binary - lensing events .",
    "in section 3 we discuss our mc simulations for planetary detection in m31 . in section 4",
    "we present our main results and in section 5 we address the conclusions .",
    "to determine the image position and magnification , one has to take the complex conjugate of equation ( [ mao ] ) and substitute the expression for @xmath8 back in it , obtaining a fifth - order polynomial in @xmath9 , i. e. @xmath23 ( with coefficients @xmath24 depending on @xmath25 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 ) , whose solutions give the image positions . due to lensing ,",
    "the source star image splits into several fragments up to a total number @xmath27 .",
    "since the lensing process conserves the source brightness and thus the magnification of each image , the total magnification corresponds to the sum over all images @xcite , i. e. @xmath28 where the determinant of the jacobian is @xmath29    a planetary lens system is characterized by the condition that the planet mass @xmath30 is much smaller with respect to the host star mass @xmath31 . in this case",
    ", the planet only induces a perturbation on the underlying paczyski curve of the primary lens .",
    "planet perturbations occur when the source star crosses and/or passes near caustics , which are the set of source positions on the @xmath32 plane at which the magnification is infinite ( i.e. those corresponding to @xmath33 ) in the idealized case of a point source .",
    "clearly , for realistic sources of finite size the magnitude gets still quite large , but finite @xcite .",
    "caustics form a single or multiple sets of closed and concave curves ( fold caustics ) which meet in cusp points @xcite .",
    "the location of the planet perturbations depends on the position of the caustics and the source trajectory .",
    "there have been several attempts to determine caustic positions and shapes by using analytic methods and treating the planet induced deviations as a perturbation @xcite . for the planetary case ,",
    "there exists two sets of caustics : `` central '' and `` planetary '' .",
    "the single , central caustic is located on the star - to - planet axis , close to the host star . for a wide range of parameters",
    "the caustic has a diamond shape and can be described by parametric equations ( as it was shown by @xcite , central astroid caustics arise if the @xcite model is used ) .",
    "planetary caustics are located away from the host star , at distance @xmath34 from the primary lens position .",
    "there is one planetary caustic ( with a diamond shape ) on the star - to - planet axis , on the planet side , when @xmath35 and two sets of caustics , off the axis , ( with triangular shape ) on the star side when @xmath36 .",
    "the dimensions of both central and planetary caustics increase by increasing the mass ratio @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a given @xmath26 value , the caustic sizes are maximized when the planet is inside the so called `` lensing zone '' , which is defined ( with some arbitrariness ) as the range of star - to - planet separation @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the time duration scale of the perturbations induced by a planet and the probability of their detection are proportional to the caustic size , at least when this region is large enough so that the planetary signals are not suppressed by the finite source effects @xcite .      since in pixel - lensing towards m31 the bulk of the source stars are red giants ( see section 3 )",
    ", one has to take into account the source finiteness .",
    "this leads to smaller planetary deviations in pixel - lensing light curves with respect to microlensing towards the galactic bulge , for which the point - like source approximation is acceptable . for finite source effects with limb darkening the magnification",
    "has to be numerically evaluated ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the normalized angular size of the source ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the source radius ) , and @xmath42 is the intensity profile of the source including limb darkening , for which we use the @xcite approximation @xmath43 with @xmath44 and the coefficients in the @xmath45-band are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( for red giant stars ) .    moreover , since during caustic crossing the magnification could have strong changes and ( at least for small mass planets and/or realistic source sizes ) typical time scale for crossing could be comparable with the exposure time @xmath50 ( needed to have a reasonable signal - to - noise level ) we take the average magnification of equation ( [ finite1 ] ) in the interval @xmath51 .",
    "finite size source effects can be relevant for two reasons .",
    "first , the relationship between the dimensionless radius @xmath52 and the impact parameter @xmath53 determines if the finite size effects are important or not for the main microlensing light curve .",
    "this occurs in the events with @xmath54 or @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "second , finite size effects may be important for the planetary deviations even if they are not relevant for microlensing without planets .",
    "indeed , @xmath52 is to be compared not only with @xmath53 , but also with the caustic size @xmath56 . in particular , whenever @xmath54 , it results that @xmath52 is typically much larger than @xmath56 ( at least for small enough mass planets ) . in this case , smoothed planetary deviations are produced in the light curves , since the planetary magnification has to be averaged on the source area . in a similar way ,",
    "depending on the lens system geometry and proper motion , whenever the ratio @xmath55 , stronger and temporally localized planetary deviations are produced in the light curves , since the caustic region results to be a non negligible fraction of the source area . within the following analysis for the detection of planetary deviations we are going to identify two classes ( i and ii ) of events , depending on the ratio @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "in the present analysis we assume that the lens is a binary system constituted by a star and a planet companion .",
    "our aim is to evaluate the probability to detect the presence of planets in m31 through earth - based pixel - lensing observations with telescopes of different diameters .",
    "these telescopes could be initiated to observe towards a microlensing event candidate , so making a high cadence observations of an ongoing microlensing event . as reference values",
    ", we adopt a ccd pixel field of view of 0.2 arcsec , a typical seeing value of 1 arcsec and an average background luminosity at telescope site of @xmath57 mag arcsec@xmath58 in @xmath45-band . to have a good s / n ratio we consider in the mc analysis exposure times @xmath50 of 30  minutes .",
    "moreover , we assume a regular sampling neglecting any loss of coverage due to bad weather conditions .    in order to take into account the spatial variation of the background level we select four directions ( named @xmath59 ) at increasing distances from the m31 centre . assuming a coordinate system with origin in the m31 centre and axes along the north - south and east - west directions , the coordinates of the selected directions",
    "are the following : @xmath60 ( 6,0 ) arcmin , @xmath61 ( 9,0 ) arcmin , @xmath62 ( 12,0 ) arcmin , @xmath63 ( 21,6 ) arcmin . in the direction @xmath60",
    "the microlensing is primarily due to self - lensing events by stars in the m31 bulge and disk , whereas towards the external directions the contribution to microlensing due to lenses belonging to the m31 halo becomes larger .",
    "our investigation of the @xmath63 direction is motivated by the detection of the anomaly in the pixel - lensing event pa-99-n2 @xcite .    as for the generation of the trial microlensing light curves",
    "we closely follow the approach outlined by @xcite .",
    "the adopted m31 astrophysical model was described by @xcite .",
    "once the event location has been selected , for any lens and source population lying along the line of sight , we use a mc approach to select the physical parameters of the systems : source magnitude , primary lens mass , source and lens distances , effective transverse velocity of source and lens , impact parameter of the lens .",
    "the luminosity of star sources , mainly red giants in the interval of absolute magnitude @xmath64 , and the corresponding radii are drawn from a sample of stars generated by a synthetic color - magnitude diagram computation algorithm described by @xcite based on the stellar evolution library @xcite and the bolometric correction database @xcite .",
    "as next , we have to select the mass @xmath65 and the ( projected ) orbital distance @xmath66 of the extrasolar planet .",
    "most of the hundreds of extrasolar planets discovered up to now ( see the web site http://exoplanet.eu ) have typically very large masses and orbit at small distances around their parent stars @xcite .",
    "this appears to be a result of observational biases @xcite since most of the planets have been detected by radial velocity and transit techniques that are most sensitive to massive and close planets .",
    "direct imaging and microlensing techniques contribute only a minor fraction of the detected events .",
    "indeed , available theoretical and numerical analysis show that most extrasolar planets are expected to have relatively smaller masses .",
    "furthermore , the ( projected ) orbital distance from their hosting stars is expected in the range @xmath67 au ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present paper we assume that the distribution of @xmath65 and orbital period @xmath68 , for @xmath69 , is given by the simple analytical expression @xcite @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . this relation is obtained by investigating the distribution of masses and orbital periods of 72 extrasolar planets , taking into account the selection effects caused by the limited velocity precision and duration of existing surveys .",
    "we note that in the analysis leading to the above distribution , it was assumed that the stars in the survey are of solar type , and therefore any dependence ( as implied by recent extrasolar planet observations ) of the planet mass on the parent star mass and metallicity has been neglected .",
    "taking that into account , one would certainly replace equation ( [ dtt ] ) with a different one , and therefore the results presented in section 4 for the detectable planet rate would change .",
    "for example , a steeper planet mass distribution ( as that found for all doppler - detected planets by @xcite with @xmath73 ) implies a smaller ( about a quarter ) overall planet detection rate , as a consequence of the decrease of the mean planet mass .",
    "more importantly , a dependence of the planet mass distribution on the parent star mass would introduce a dependence of the planet detection rate on the lens population ( bulge or disk stars ) that could be recognized , provided a sufficient event statistics towards different lines of sight would be available . in equation ( [ dtt ] ) , the upper limit of the planetary mass is set at @xmath74 .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the usually assumed lower mass limit for brown dwarfs .",
    "indeed , in the range @xmath75 the two populations overlap .",
    "moreover , in the simulation we select a lower planetary mass limit of @xmath76 .",
    "once the masses of the binary components and the planet period have been selected , the binary separation @xmath66 is obtained by assuming a circular motion of the planet .    as a parameter in our mc analysis",
    "we introduce the number @xmath77 of images per day .",
    "we take @xmath77 in the range 2  12 day@xmath78 , the latter value corresponding to a sampling time of two hours . for all selected values of @xmath77 , the corresponding binary light curve at any time",
    "is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the background signal from the galaxy and the sky , @xmath81 is the unamplified source star flux and @xmath82 the time varying magnification , that takes into account both the source finiteness and the motion of the lens - source - observer system during the exposure time @xmath50 . to mimic superpixel photometry",
    "@xcite used in a real observational campaign we evaluate the star and the background flux within a @xmath83-pixel square `` superpixel '' , whose size @xmath83 is determined to cover most of the average seeing disk .",
    "we recall that we consider the pixel - lensing regime where the noise is dominated by the ( line of sight dependent ) background noise @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we add to @xmath84 a gaussian noise .      as a first step , within the mc simulation , we have to test whether the flux variation due to the microlensing event is significant with respect to the background noise @xmath85 , where @xmath86 identifies the line - of - sight . to asses the detection of a flux variation",
    "we evaluate its statistical significance testing whenever and to what extent at least three consecutive points exceed the baseline level by 3@xmath87 , following the analysis described by @xcite .",
    "we remark that the condition on the variation significance is the only one used at this stage . in the following we refer to events that show a significant flux variations as to `` detectable '' events .",
    "the expected signature of an extrasolar planet orbiting the lens star is the presence of perturbations with respect to the corresponding smooth paczyski light curve .",
    "therefore , we look for a selection criterion based on the analysis of the significance of such deviations . to this purpose ,",
    "given the wide range of the microlensing parameters and the corresponding planetary deviations , we consider two indicators for which we select ( by the direct survey of many light curves ) threshold values .",
    "they are the mean deviation ( in units of @xmath87 ) of the planetary light curve from that of a single lens event , and the maximum value of the time dependent relative planetary magnification ( in units of the expected paczyski value ) .    at first",
    ", we fit the light curve in equation ( [ 8888 ] ) with a paczyski - like law modified to take into account finite source effects and determine the best fit parameters .",
    "the latter are the baseline flux @xmath88 , the maximum magnification time @xmath89 , the unamplified star flux @xmath90 , the einstein time @xmath91 , the dimensionless impact parameter @xmath92 and the dimensionless , projected star radius @xmath93 .",
    "accordingly , the time dependent flux @xmath94 due to a single lens event is given by @xmath95 where the magnification @xcite @xmath96 is given in terms of the time varying ( normalized ) lens angular distance to the source @xmath97 @xmath98 ^ 2 + [ ( t - t^0_0)/t^0_{\\rm e}]^2 } ~,\\ ] ] and @xmath99 is the analogous of equation ( [ finite1 ] ) , in this case evaluated by using the analytical approximation given by @xcite .",
    "then , we can evaluate the time dependent variable @xmath100 and the residual to the single lens fit @xmath101 where @xmath84 is the light curve including the planet perturbations , @xmath94 the paczyski fit as above and @xmath102 is evaluated according to @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can consider large values of @xmath103 as a significant indicator of the presence of detectable planetary deviations in the light curves .",
    "actually , we use the sum of the residuals along the whole light curve , namely @xmath104 , as a first quantitative measure of the statistical significance of the planetary signals in the ongoing microlensing event . here",
    "@xmath105~i$ ] , where @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) is the initial ( final ) instant and @xmath108 the total number of points . by the direct survey of many light curves we select a threshold value",
    "follow a gaussian distribution ( with mean value @xmath109 and standard deviation @xmath110 ) in the case of light curves generated as single lens events and subsequently fitted with a paczyski law . ]",
    "we further require a minimal number of points @xmath112 , even not consecutive , which deviate significantly ( over @xmath113 ) from the paczyski best fit .",
    "we adopt the criterion _",
    "( i ) _ @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in other words",
    ", the latter condition means that if we have significant deviations at only one or two points , we can not conclude that they are caused by a planet orbiting the primary lens .",

    "this is characteristics , in particular , for events with large source radii and small planetary masses .",
    "our second criterion is therefore meant to look for and quantify the single more significant planetary perturbations . to this purpose",

    "we consider the possibility to detect planets in m31 by using pixel - lensing observations with telescopes of different sizes and observational strategies .",
    "this is the only way to detect planets in other galaxies and acquire information allowing a comparison of the planetary systems in m31 with respect to those in the milky way .",
    "we carry out mc simulations and explore the multi - dimensional space of the physical parameters of the planetary systems and characterize the sample of microlensing events for which the planet detections are more likely to be observed .",
    "we have assumed that each lens star in the m31 bulge and disk hosts one planet , and used for the planet mass distribution an simplified law , neglecting any dependence of the planet mass on the parent star mass and metallicity .",
    "consideration of finite source effects induces a smoothening of the planetary deviations with respect to the point - like source approximation and , in turn , decreases the chance to detect planets .",
    "it also implies that in pixel - lensing searches towards m31 only few exposures per day could be enough to detect planetary features in light curves , at least when using large enough telescopes .",
    "we find that the pixel - lensing technique favours the detection of large mass planets ( @xmath154 ) , even if planets with mass less than @xmath155 can be detected ( with small probability , however ) by using large telescopes with a sufficient photometric stability .",
    "microlensing is intrinsically a `` no repetition '' phenomenon and variable stars may mimic microlensing events and contaminate the sample of events attributed to microlensing .",
    "therefore , real observations should be done at least in two bands , to check for achromaticity and be confident that the contamination by variables can be sorted out . however , a minor chromaticity is expected since the source limb darkening profile depends on the considered band and on the spectral type of the source star ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) .    finally , we remark that although we have neglected the contribution to microlensing events of machos in both galactic halos ( in this respect the estimated planet rate should be considered as a lower bound ) , pixel - lensing observations towards m31 could be very useful in establishing whether planets may form around machos as well .",

    "<S> we study the possibility to detect extrasolar planets in m31 through pixel - lensing observations . using a monte carlo approach , we select the physical parameters of the binary lens system , a star hosting a planet , and we calculate the pixel - lensing light curve taking into account the finite source effects . indeed , their inclusion is crucial since the sources in m31 microlensing events are mainly giant stars . </S>",
    "<S> light curves with detectable planetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the corresponding paczyski shapes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the time scale of planetary deviations in light curves increase ( up to 3 - 4 days ) as the source size increases . </S>",
    "<S> this means that only few exposures per day , depending also on the required accuracy , may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary companion . </S>",
    "<S> although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about @xmath0 , even small mass planets ( @xmath1 ) can cause significant deviations , at least in the observations with large telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in the former case , the probability to find detectable planetary features in pixel - lensing light curves is at most a few percent of the detectable events , and therefore many events have to be collected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in m31 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also supports the claim that the anomaly found in the candidate event pa-99-n2 towards m31 can be explained by a companion object orbiting the lens star .    </S>",
