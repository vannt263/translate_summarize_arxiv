    "we have observed that there are the two distinct behaviors of the odd and the string correlations , i.e. , one is of the monotonic , ( ii ) the other is of the oscillatory .",
    "based on the topological characterization , we find that there are the four topologically ordered phases in the whole interaction parameter range [ fig .",

    "the critical exponents of the string order parameters are obtained as @xmath154 , which implies that the topological quantum phase transitions belong to the ising type of universality class .",
    "consistently , we obtain the central charges @xmath1 from the entanglement entropy . in addition , the singular behaviors of the second - order derivatives of ground state energy , the string order parameters characterizing the four haldane phases , the continues behaviors of the von neumann entropy and the fls allow us to conclude that the phase transitions in the one - dimensional qcm are of the second - order , in contrast to previous studies .",
