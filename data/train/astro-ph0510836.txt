    "p  cygni is a key object for understanding mass loss in the most luminous evolved stars . at a distance of 1.7 kpc ( adopted throughout this paper ; najarro et al .",
    "1997 ) it is the nearest luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , and it is one of only two stars in our galaxy to have been observed during a giant lbv eruption ( p  cyg s eruption in 1600 and @xmath5  car s giant eruption in the 1840s ; see humphreys et al .",
    "giant eruptions of lbvs  where the bolometric luminosity increases by a few magnitudes and the progenitor star survives the event  have been recognized in other galaxies as well ; examples include the `` type v '' supernovae sn1961v in ngc  1058 ( van dyk et al .",
    "2002 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; goodrich et al .",
    "1989 ) and sn1954j ( v12 ) in ngc  2403 ( tamann & sandage 1968 ; smith et al.2001b ; van dyk et al .",
    "2005 ) , and several more recent @xmath5  car analogs classified as type iin supernovae ( e.g. , filippenko 2005 ; van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ; wagner et al .  2004 ; drissen et al .",
    "the lightcurves of @xmath5  car and p  cyg showed dips of several magnitudes after their eruptions ( humphreys et al .",
    "1999 ; de groot 1988 ; lamers & de groot 1992 ) , usually attributed to dust formation .",
    "nebulae around these stars provide useful clues to the physics of their outbursts , such as the explosion geometry , chemical composition , ejection speed , mass , and kinetic energy .",
    "since the extragalactic @xmath5  car analogs are too distant to spatially resolve their nebulae , and since @xmath5  car itself is such an extreme example , p  cyg s nebula provides an important benchmark for understanding the evolution of intermediate - luminosity lbvs ( see smith et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "p  cyg s nebula is harder to observe than the homunculus of @xmath5  car because of its weaker contrast with the central star at all wavelengths .",
    "this difference is partially due to the longer time elapsed since p  cyg s eruption ( 400 yr , as opposed to only 160 for @xmath5 car ) , allowing the ejecta more time to disperse and fade .",
    "excess infrared ( ir ) emission from dust in p  cyg s nebula is much less pronounced than in @xmath5 car  dust emission at 220 @xmath0 has not been detected above the thermal - bremsstrahlung emission from p  cyg s stellar wind ( smith et al .",
    "2001a ; waters & wesselius 1986 ) .",
    "the cool dust excess at far - ir wavelengths ( waters & wesselius 1986 ) is also meager compared to other lbv nebulae like the homunculus of @xmath5 car ( morris et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al . 2003 ) or the ring nebula around ag car ( mcgregor et al .",
    "1988 ) . while the most basic physical quantities ( mass , kinetic energy ) of the ejecta from @xmath5 car s giant eruption are now fairly well constrained ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) , those same quantities for p  cyg s nebula are not .",
    "p  cyg is surrounded by complex emission - line nebulosity , including an inner shell with a radius of @xmath11011 , an outer shell with a radius of @xmath11@xmath66 , and some more extended infundibular debris in a `` giant lobe '' several arcminutes across ( barlow et al.1994 ; oconnor et al .  1998 ;",
    "meaburn 2001 ; meaburn et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 , 2004 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on the near - ir spectrum of the bright `` inner shell '' , which is also observed in radio free - free emission ( skinner et al .",
    "johnson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found the inner nebula to be nitrogen rich , indicating cno - processed ejecta like in @xmath5 car ( e.g. , smith & morse 2004 ) .",
    "a valuable spectral diagnostic of p cyg s nebula is its bright emission from ir lines of [ fe  ii ] , such as @xmath212567 , @xmath216435 , and related transitions between the @xmath7 term to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 terms .",
    "these are collisionally - excited lines with an upper level @xmath11 ev above the ground state .",
    "they are bright in the nebula of p  cyg and in the nebulae of several other lbvs ( smith 2002a , 2002b , 2005 ; hamann et al .",
    "1994 ; allen et al .  1985 ) . while bright ir emission from these [ fe  ii ] transitions is seen in shock - excited sources like herbig - haro objects and supernova remnants ( e.g. , hartigan et al .",
    "2004b ; graham et al .  1987",
    "; oliva et al.1990 ; mckee et al .  1984 ) , and",
    "so is often taken as a signpost of shocks , the excitation mechanism in all lbvs is not uniform . in some lbv",
    "nebulae the [ fe  ii ] emission is due to shocks , while in others uv excitation is responsible ( see smith 2002a ) .",
    "analysis of these [ fe  ii ] lines is complicated by disagreement in the literature on their relative transition rates ( nussbaumer & storey 1988 ; quinet et al .",
    "1996 ; bautista & pradhan 1998 ) .    preliminary near - ir spectra of p  cyg in the h band showed bright [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 out to 10  from the star ( smith 2001 , 2002a ) , consistent with the inner shell seen in images ( barlow et al .",
    "1994 ) . here",
    "we investigate the ir emission from [ fe  ii ] in more detail with spectral observations from nasa s infrared telscope facility ( irtf ) , sampling many [ fe  ii ] transitions across the 12.5 @xmath0 wavelength range at moderate resolution using spex , and at high spectral resolution for the 16435   line alone using cshell .",
    "we obtained long - slit 1 - 2.5 @xmath0 spectra of p cygni s nebula on 2004 august 19 with the near - ir spectrograph spex ( rayner et al.2003 ) mounted on the irtf .",
    "spex uses a 1024@xmath101024 aladdin3 insb array , with a spatial pixel scale of 0@xmath1115 .",
    "we used spex in long - slit mode with the 0@xmath113-wide slit ( providing a spectral resolution of @xmath122000 ) oriented along p.a.=270@xmath13 , and positioned 4  north of the star to sample emission from the nebula while avoiding the bright central star ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "sky subtraction was accomplished by nodding 30  along the slit so that the nebula was always in part of the slit ; the total on - source exposure time was 16 minutes in each of four filters ( k , h , and two filters in the j band ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was measured using an internal emission lamp , while flux calibration and correction for telluric absorption were accomplished using observations of spectroscopic standard stars . on the night",
    "these observations were obtained , the conditions were photometric and the seeing was @xmath10@xmath118 .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectrum extracted from a 2-wide segment of the long - slit data , corresponding to a bright knot in the nebula located 4  north and 8  east of the star ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , this is not a true sample of the nebular emission , since there is significant contamination from instrumental scattered starlight , and starlight reflected by dust ( continuum emission and stellar wind lines are seen ) .",
    "therefore , figure 3 shows the same spectrum , but with the reflected starlight subtracted .",
    "the reflected starlight was sampled from a different region along the slit closer to the star where the continuum emission was much stronger relative to the nebular emission ( it was simple to disentangle the contributions of nebular emission and scattered light , since [ fe  ii ] lines like @xmath216435 are absent in the spectrum of the central star ) .",
    "intensities of nebular lines measured in this spectrum are listed in table 1 , where noise in fitting the continuum level dominates the uncertainties .",
    "additional uncertainties in the flux calibration between various wavelength regions depend on the seeing and the exact position of the slit aperture during observations of the standard star , potentially causing changes in the fraction of the total point spread function included in the slit ; these uncertainties are harder to quantify .",
    "however , it is reassuring that the scattered continuum light from the star in figure 2 follows a smooth trend from one band to the next  there is no strong discontinuity in the continuum level between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands , for example , indicating no severe difference in slit position between exposures of the standard star .",
    "figure 4 shows tracings of the @xmath212567 and @xmath216435 intensities and ratios along the slit , as well as the @xmath215335/@xmath216435 flux ratio , which is a diagnostic of variations in the electron density .      on 2003",
    "july 31 we observed p  cygni with the high - resolution spectrograph cshell ( greene et al .",
    "1993 ) mounted on the irtf .",
    "these observations were conducted remotely from the university of colorado .",
    "cshell has a 256@xmath10256 sbrc insb array with a spatial pixel scale of 0@xmath112 , although only 160 pixels are illuminated in the spatial direction , yielding an effective slit length of roughly 30 .",
    "we used a slit width of 0@xmath115 , providing a spectral resolving power of @xmath1243,000 or 7 km s@xmath16 . the circular variable filter ( cvf ) wheel isolates a single order , and we chose a central wavelength corresponding to the bright [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 emission line ( vacuum wavelength 16439.98  ) .",
    "we observed three separate pointings with the slit oriented at p.a.=0  and centered on the central star , 3  east , and 4  west ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "at each position , we used total on - source integration times of 2030 minutes , and sky - subtraction was accomplished with identical observations of an off - source position .",
    "the resulting 2-d spectra at these three pointings are shown in figure 5 .",
    "wavelengths were calibrated using telluric absorption lines , adopting vacuum wavelengths in the telluric spectrum available from noao .",
    "velocities in figure 5 are heliocentric , and have been corrected for the motion of the earth ( to convert to lsr velocities for p  cygni , add 18.1 km s@xmath16 ) .      to supplement these ir spectra ( specifically for the purpose of investigating the electron density and ionization fraction ) , we also obtained visual - wavelength spectra of the nebula .",
    "we observed p cygni on 2005 may 5 using the goldcam spectrograph on the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 2.1 m telescope .",
    "we used two different settings to cover the full optical spectrum from about 3400  7200  . for blue wavelengths",
    ", we used grating 58 in second order , and for red wavelengths we used grating 47 in first order . both observations used a 1@xmath112@xmath105  slit aperture offset 4  north of the star ( identical to the spex slit position shown in fig .",
    "total exposure times were 30 minutes in the blue , and 40 minutes for the red spectrum .",
    "flux calibration was performed with reference to spectra of the central star , p cygni itself , for which the visual spectral energy distribution has been studied extensively ( e.g. , lamers et al .",
    "some relative line intensities are discussed further in  5.1 and  5.2 to aid our interpretation of the ir spectra .",
    "after subtracting the scattered starlight , the near - ir spectrum of p  cygni s nebula in figure 3 is dominated by lines of [ fe  ii ] .",
    "the strength of the [ fe  ii ] lines is unusual compared to circumstellar nebulae around other types of evolved stars , such as planetary nebulae and wolf - rayet ring nebulae , and is a testament to the high density of the gas , and the high luminosity and relatively low effective temperature of the central star . the bright [ fe  ii ] spectrum of p cygni s nebula resembles that of the homunculus nebula around @xmath5  car ( smith 2002@xmath17 ) , although p cygni shows no emission lines of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the lack of h@xmath18 is probably due to the much lower mass of p cygni s nebula ( see  5.3 ) and to the extreme youth of the homunculus .",
    "the lack of h@xmath18 is also consistent with the fact that we detect no emission from the 2.3 @xmath0 co emission features .",
    "these bright near - ir lines of [ fe  ii ] are common in the circumstellar nebulae of lbvs in general ( smith 2002@xmath19 ) .",
    "the long - slit aperture allows us to investigate spatial variations across the nebula .",
    "for example , figure 4 shows that across the spex slit placed 4  north of the star , there is little variation in either the reddening or electron density , traced by the [ fe  ii ] ratios @xmath212567/@xmath216435 and @xmath215335/@xmath216435 , respectively .",
    "this verifies that in general , the physical conditions we derive for one particular region of the nebula probably apply to most of the bright [ fe  ii ] shell as well .",
    "figure 3 and table 1 also show several emission lines of [ ni  ii ] . of particlar interest",
    "are [ ni  ii ] @xmath223079 and @xmath223688 ( both are @xmath20 ) , which are rarely seen in circumstellar nebulae .",
    "@xmath219388 ( @xmath20 ) , is expected to be strong but was not within the wavelength range of our observations . ]",
    "these lines share the same upper term as [ ni  ii ] @xmath27379 and @xmath27412 ( @xmath21 ) , which are extremely bright in the nebula of p cygni ( johnson et al .",
    "1992 ; barlow et al .",
    "1994 ) , and whose strength is thought to be a consequence of fluorescence ( lucy 1995 ) .",
    "these same lines are also strong in the crab nebula ( dennefeld & pequignot 1983 ; henry et al .  1984 ) , and are seen in herbig - haro jets very close to their sources ( hartigan et al .",
    "it is not known if a similar continuum - fluorescence process affects the [ fe  ii ] lines .",
    "the numerous [ fe  ii ] lines in our p  cyg spectra make it possible to constrain einstein a coefficients .",
    "these calculations are important because the a values for these transitions computed in two previous studies ( quinet et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter q96 ; nussbaumer & storey 1988 , hereafter ns88 ) differ by as much as 30% . a 30%  error in the [ fe  ii ] @xmath212567/@xmath216435 flux ratio , used to estimate reddening because these lines originate from the same upper level , translates into a much larger error when reddening corrections are extrapolated to optical wavelengths .",
    "for example , if the intrinsic ratio of [ fe  ii ] @xmath212567/@xmath216435 increases by 30% , then an object which would have had a@xmath22=0 using the lower ratio now has a@xmath22=2.85 .",
    "the spectra in fig .  2 recorded ten [ fe  ii ] emission lines between the second - excited term @xmath7 and the first - excited term @xmath23f , and an additional seven [ fe  ii ] lines from @xmath7 to the ground term @xmath9 .",
    "the lowest 13 energy levels of fe  ii , are respectively , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , and in what follows we simply refer to these levels as 1 through 13 .",
    "for example , in this notation the 12567    and 16435    transitions are 10 - 1 , and 10 - 6 , respectively .",
    "table  2 compiles the 17 observed transitions into 30 line ratios in four groups , where each group originates from a common upper state . within each group",
    "we adopted the a value for the brightest transition from ns88 , whose compilation agrees somewhat better with our data than do the values of q96 .",
    "other a values within the group then follow from the observed emission line ratio and known reddening ( a@xmath22=1.89 , lamers et al .  1983 ) .",
    "table  2 shows the predicted emission line ratios for a@xmath22=0 and a@xmath22=1.89 for q96 and ns88 , together with the line ratios predicted from the new list of a - values in table  3 , reddened with a@xmath22=1.89 . by construction ,",
    "the new dereddened a coefficients match the observations in table  2 .",
    "the last column of table  2 is the uncertainty in the observed ratio .",
    "the first and third lines of table  3 are of particular interest to all reddening estimates using near - ir [ fe  ii ] lines .",
    "the new ratio of a values for the [ fe  ii ] lines at 12567   and 16435 is 1.13 , @xmath110%  higher than the value of 1.04 of ns88 and over 40%  higher than the q96 value of 0.79 .",
    "this corresponds to an intrinsic [ fe  ii ] @xmath212567/@xmath216435 line intensity ratio of 1.49 , higher than q96 ( 1.04 ) or ns88 ( 1.36 ) .",
    "as table  3 shows , when ns88 and q96 disagree most we typically find a values closer to ns88 , but often the new values do not lie between the estimates of ns88 and q96 .",
    "thus , our results indicate that previous studies that adopted the intrinsic @xmath212567/@xmath216435 line ratios from q96 or ns88 have underestimated the true reddening . the @xmath212567/@xmath216435 line ratio is often used to estimate reddening in agn as well ; rodriguez - ardila et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have also argued that the a - values of q96 and ns88 are incorrect , but they favor an even _ lower _ value for the intrinsic line ratio of only 0.98 .",
    "our study of p cygni reveals that this can not be correct , since even our raw _ observed _ value for this ratio is 1.25 .",
    "we did not attempt to constrain collision strengths between the various levels or compare a values between different groups because the densities within the p  cygni nebula are not known well , and the flow is clumpy ( see  4 ) .",
    "however , such a calculation could be done with a better understanding of the electron densities in the shell . a deeper optical search for faint emission lines would help in this regard .",
    "figure 5 shows high - dispersion spectra of [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 at three different positions in the nebula , with the slit oriented in the north / south direction and centered 3  east of the star , on the star , and 4  west .",
    "the morphology seen in figure 5 is consistent with three slices through a roughly spherical expanding shell . however , it is obviously not a uniformly smooth sphere , as prominent knots and corrugations exist .",
    "the detailed structure of the shell is reminiscent of vishniac instabilities when a thin shell with dense knots is swept up by a faster low - density wind ( e.g. , garcia - segura et al .",
    "this is indeed the case , as the shell expansion is slower than the terminal velocity of the present - day stellar wind ( see  4.2 ) . aside from these perturbations with typical sizes of 12 ,",
    "the only striking departure from spherical symmetry is a possible blow - out at 80 to 0 km s@xmath16 ( heliocentric ) at the southern edge of the shell , most apparent in figure 5@xmath17 .",
    "although the overall shape of the nebula is basically spherical , it does show some large - scale brightness asymmetry .",
    "for example , in all three slit positions in figure 5 , the brightest emission is north of the nebula s center and on the blueshifted side of the shell .",
    "there are corresponding local brightness maxima on the opposite side ( to the south and redshifted ) of the shell in figures 5@xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "this hints at a sort of reflected symmetry consistent with cross sections through an inclined ring or torus of brighter emission embedded in the shell , with its northern polar axis tilted away from us by @xmath145 .",
    "the [ fe  ii]-emitting knots in figure 5 have resolved linewidths of typically fwhm@xmath271520 km s@xmath16 .",
    "this is obviously too broad for an iron line to be due to thermal broadening , so it represents dynamic expansion of the gas or perhaps broadening due to shocks as the stellar wind interacts with slower nebular material .",
    "the high - resolution spectra in figure 5 have clearly resolved the spatial and kinematic structure of p  cyg s nebula , allowing us to quantitatively constrain several of its basic physical parameters . the slit position centered on the star is the most useful as it crosses through the middle diameter of the nebula , sampling the largest spatial extent and the highest velocities .",
    "figure 6 shows the same data as in figure 5@xmath17 for the slit passing through the star , but with two ellipses drawn to represent the idealized inner and outer boundaries of a single spherical shell ( with radii of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) .",
    "because of the knots and corrugations in the nebula , these ellipses are obviously not perfect boundaries for the shell , but they are useful for guiding our interpretation of the nebular structure and for eventually estimating its mass and kinetic energy in  5 below . derived parameters for these two surfaces are discussed below and are summarized in table  4 .    _ systemic velocity _ : the centroid velocity of each of the two ellipses gives the center - of - mass velocity of the nebula .",
    "the dashed vertical line in each panel of figures 5 and 6 shows the approximate centroid velocity of the shell , taken to represent the systemic velocity of p  cygni at @xmath30=38@xmath315 km s@xmath16 ( the uncertainty here is dominated by the irregular structure in the shell , rather than statistical measurement uncertainty ) .",
    "relative to the local standard of rest , this systemic velocity would be about @xmath32=20@xmath315 km s@xmath16 , which is in reasonable agreement with 22.6@xmath311.5 km s@xmath16 estimated by barlow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) from optical lines .",
    "_ expansion velocity _ : the inner boundary of the shell ( @xmath28 ) has an expansion velocity of @xmath31120 km s@xmath16 with respect to the systemic velocity , and the outer edge ( @xmath29 ) expands at @xmath31152 km s@xmath16 . these are slower than the present - day terminal speed of p  cygni s wind , which is roughly 185 km s@xmath16 ( najarro et al.1997 ; lamers et al .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect a 65 km s@xmath16 shock at the inside surface of the nebula where the faster stellar wind catches up .",
    "however , this shock will not profoundly affect the gas temperature or the relative line intensities in the nebular spectrum , since radiative energy input from the star exceeds that of the kinetic energy from the wind by a factor of @xmath110@xmath23 .",
    "the mean expansion speed of @xmath31136 km s@xmath16 that we measure from [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 is close to the value of 140 km s@xmath16 measured from optical [ n  ii ] lines by barlow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but significantly higher than the 110 km s@xmath16 expansion they measured from [ ni  ii ] lines .",
    "barlow et al .  explained the discrepancy between the apparent expansion speeds of [ n  ii ] and [ ni  ii ] by proposing that the [ ni  ii ] emission arises in slower dense knots that have been overtaken by the stellar wind , producing more extended bow shocks around the knots that emit [ n  ii ] and other nebular lines .",
    "our new results contradict this conjecture , since the [ fe  ii ] and [ ni  ii ] transitions both share the same low ionization and high critical densities that motivated the explanation .",
    "the densest knots should emit [ fe  ii ] as well .",
    "_ shell radius and thickness _ : the inner and outer radii of the idealized spherical shell in figure 6 are @xmath28=7@xmath118 or 2.0@xmath1010@xmath33 cm and @xmath29=9@xmath117 or 2.5@xmath1010@xmath33 cm .",
    "some emission is seen to extend beyond these boundaries in the form of dense knots ( interior ) or diffuse emission ( exterior ) .",
    "the overall thickness of the shell is @xmath34=1@xmath119 or 5@xmath1010@xmath35 cm . aside from a few redshifted knots located 56  south of the star , the shell is hollow ( i.e. there is no younger shell expanding inside this one ) .    _ dynamical age _ : if the ellipses in figure 6 trace spherical surfaces of the shell , then at a distance of 1.7 kpc , r/@xmath36 gives the dynamical age of each feature assuming linear motion .",
    "for @xmath28 the dynamical age is 531 yr , and for @xmath29 it is 524 yr ; these are in good agreement with one another considering that the uncertainty is of order @xmath315% .",
    "of course , the dynamical age reflects linear motion and does not necessarily signify the true age of the ejecta , since the shell may have been accelerated by the stellar wind or decelerated by slower ambient material . the present - day nebular expansion speed ( 136 km s@xmath16 )",
    "is in fact lower than the stellar wind speed ( 185 km s@xmath16 ) , suggesting that the shell has decelerated to @xmath13/4 of its initial speed .",
    "coincidentally , the dynamical age we measure assuming linear motion is 4/3 of the time since the 1600 outburst . in other words , by assuming linear motion we overestimate the age by precisely the same factor that the shell s velocity has apparently slowed .",
    "this agreement would seem too fortuitous if the bright shell around p cygni were not ejected in the 1600  a.d .  outburst . given the lack of any comparably bright ejecta closer to the star , _",
    "we conclude that the bright _ [ fe  ii ] _ shell in figures 5 and 6 was indeed ejected during the 1600 outburst and has been decelerated by interaction with the ambient medium_.    _ filling factor _ : while the overall thickness of the shell derived above is roughly 1@xmath119 , it is clear from figure 5 that the shell is significantly thinner and corrugated with several knots and loops ; i.e. it has complex substructure .",
    "the [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 emission is dominated by the densest material in clumps and filaments , so for estimating the mass in the next section , a representative density filling factor @xmath37 is necessary . assigning a value for the filling factor based on the observed structure of the nebula is subjective , but we can nevertheless make an educated guess , since the filling factor of the thick shell drawn in figure 6 is clearly not 1",
    ". a value closer to 0.2 seems more appropriate , but an even lower value might apply if our spatial resolution is inadequate to resolve the sizes of features in the nebula .",
    "we provisionally take @xmath37=0.2@xmath310.1 .",
    "in the previous section , we concluded that the bright [ fe  ii ] shell seen in our spectra is indeed the major product of the 1600 outburst of p  cygni .",
    "thus , the mass and kinetic energy of this shell trace the total mass ejected and the mechanical luminosity of the outburst .",
    "if p  cygni s nebula can be approximated as a spherical hollow shell , then a rough estimate of the total gas mass of the nebula can be expressed as    @xmath38    where @xmath39=2.2 is the mean molecular weight for a neutral ( see  5.2 ) he mass fraction of @xmath40=0.55 ( najarro et al .",
    "1997 ) ; f@xmath41 is the hydrogen ionization fraction , and @xmath37 is the filling factor in the shell . the geometry is constrained ( see  4.2 ) from our high - resolution spectra of [ fe  ii ] @xmath216435 , while the filling factor is only marginally constrained .",
    "this leaves the electron density and the h ionization fraction as the unknown quantities that need to be addressed before we can estimate the mass from equation 1 .",
    "johnson et al .  (",
    "1992 ) measured an electron density of @xmath42=600 @xmath43 using the [ s  ii ] @xmath446717,6731 doublet , although their spectra had low sensitivity .",

    "if , as should occur in the cooling zone of a shock , charge exchange is the dominant process that ties n  ii / n  i to h  ii / h  i , then    @xmath54    the exponential factor arises from the different ionization potentials of n ( 14.53 ev ) and h ( 13.59 ev ) , while the factor of 4.5 reflects the relative statistical weights of the n  ii+h  i and n  i+h  ii outlet channels . at @xmath55k ,",

    "hence , whenever charge exchange dominates the ionization states and n is mostly ionized , so is h.    as the ionization parameter ( ratio of density of ionizing photons to total h density ) increases , photoionization becomes increasingly more important relative to charge exchange in determining the ionization fractions of h and n. in p cygni s nebular shell at the adopted density , the ionization parameter is roughly 10@xmath57 . the value for the hydrogen ionization fraction derived from the observed [ n  ii]/[n  i ] ratio ( a few percent neutral ) agrees with what we would expect _ a priori _ from this ionization parameter based on the lyman continuum flux escaping the thick wind of p cygni using an upper limit of @xmath5810@xmath59 s@xmath16 from recent modeling work that is in preparation by najarro & hillier ( najarro 2005 , private comm . ; see also najarro et al .",

    "this is only an order - of magnitude estimate owing to the factor of @xmath12 uncertainties in the geometric filling factor and the electron density .",

    "this seems reasonable , since a mass - loss rate much greater than 10@xmath65  m@xmath3 yr@xmath16 would be required for a significant pseudo photosphere to form in the wind ( smith et al .",

    "given the high mass - loss rate during the 1600 outburst and the dip in the historical lightcurve after the eruption , it is reasonable to assume that significant quantities of dust formed during the event .",
