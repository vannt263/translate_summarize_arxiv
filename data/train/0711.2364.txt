    "it is a tempting idea to approximate the wavefunction of an interacting particle by mediating gauge fields surrounding the particle .",
    "such a description of a fast - moving charged particle by virtual photons is long known as the weizsker - williams approximation .",
    "if we apply this idea to the strong interaction , we can approximately give the wavefunction of a heavy hadron by gluon fields which extend from the local color distribution inside the hadron .",
    "the formalism of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) can accommodate the non - abelian extension of the weizsker - williams approximation  @xcite .",
    "the cgc formalism aims to embody the parton saturation picture arising as a result of the small - x evolution at high energies  @xcite .",
    "the geometric scaling beautifully indicates the existence of the saturation scale as a function of bjorken s x  @xcite .",
    "the cgc formalism has been forming an important building - block of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high energies . with a gaussian approximation for distribution of the random color source and its dispersion given by the saturation scale  @xcite",
    ", we reach the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model  @xcite .",
    "so far , the mv model has been well examined analytically in the case of a light projectile ( e.g.  a color dipole , a proton , etc ) scattering off a dense cgc target  @xcite .",
    "the scattering problem of two cgc objects , i.e.  high - energy nucleus - nucleus collision  @xcite is hard to solve analytically , however , and the possible analysis is limited to the numerical method  @xcite . only the initial fields right after the collision ( i.e.  initial conditions ) are analytically known in a simple form  @xcite .",
    "the initial chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields are thus calculable by means of the proper gaussian average over the color source distribution  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will address a problem that the numerical formulation of the mv model assumes a crude approximation which leads to a significant difference from the right answer .",
    "we will clarify the physical meaning to ascertain that the assumed approximation is not acceptable .",
    "the crucial point is that the formulation involves two distinct limits in the longitudinal direction ; one is the vanishing extent of a nucleus and the other is the vanishing correlation length in the random color distribution .",
    "we will then quantify how much the numerical procedure turns out to underestimate the expectation value of the initial fields as compared to the analytical answer .",
    "one might wonder if the issue to be discussed here is academic and only a technical detail , for phenomenological models are useful as long as they can fit in with empirical data .",
    "the existing numerical simulations in the mv model are , in fact , fairly consistent with experimental observations at rhic ( relativistic heavy - ion collider ) .",
    "we would emphasize , however , that the mv model is not a fitting model but a theoretical description based on qcd .",
    "therefore , one should not make little of correctness checking as a theory problem .    even though the numerical calculations underestimate the field expectation value",
    ", one might suspect that its effect is negligible from the fact that the numerical simulation agrees with rhic experimental data .",
    "we shall see , however , that the approximation used in the numerical simulation causes a factor over 10 in the initial energy density .",
    "such a discrepancy is not visible in the former numerical works in the mv model because the choice of the mv model parameter @xmath0 can absorb it .",
    "all the observables scale in accord with @xmath0 in the saturation regime , and in the numerical simulation usually , @xmath0 is determined so as to reproduce the particle multiplicity . as a result , for instance ,",
    "twice larger @xmath0 leads to 16 times larger energy density which may compensate for the discrepancy in the dimensionless coefficient .",
    "this `` posteriori reasoning '' would sound fine as a phenomenological approach .",
    "the mv model is a theory , however , as we emphasized above .",
    "the essential notion of the cgc idea is that a universal description for the hadron wavefunction becomes possible once the saturation occurs .",
    "hence , @xmath0 could be fixed independently by information obtained in the pqcd calculation or in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) through the relation to the saturation scale @xmath1 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "[ see a recent nice work @xcite for careful discussions . ]",
    "it is , of course , quite difficult to specify @xmath0 for rhic in this way because the relevant @xmath1 at rhic is not unique from the kinematics unlike the dis case .",
    "the reason we would stick to rigorousness also lies in the time scale of early evolution after the heavy - ion collision .",
    "a larger @xmath0 may lift the underestimated energy and multiplicity up at the cost of changing the time scale @xmath2 . moreover",
    ", our finding must have a significant effect on the `` glasma '' instability proposed in ref .  @xcite . because the correct treatment in the longitudinal direction is important in our argument , as we will see later",
    ", the instability with respect to the longitudinal variable ( rapidity ) should naturally be affected .",
    "actually the instability is found too weak in ref .",
    "it is likely that the numerical simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite underestimates the instability strength in the same way as for the energy density .",
    "if so , there might be a chance that the genuine glasma instability would occur faster to contribute more or less to the early thermalization mechanism .",
    "one more point that motivates us to reveal the discrepancy stemming from the numerical approximation is the infrared ( ir ) property of the mv model .",
    "the ir cutoff has a physical meaning , while the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff should be zero in the end .",
    "the dependence on the ir cutoff strongly relies on the approximation .",
    "this feature would bring about uncertainty , as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to the overall dimensionless factor .    in this work",
    "we will adopt the same prescription for the analytical calculations as in the numerical simulation to regularize the uv and ir singularities ; we use the lattice formulation with the spacing and the system size given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this enables us to make a direct comparison between the analytical and numerical results .",
    "here we will make a quick review on the mv model applied for the relativistic heavy - ion collision ( two - source problem ) .",
    "if we have two sources which represent particles moving fast in the positive and negative @xmath5-directions ( `` right '' and `` left '' respectively ) , we can write the corresponding current using the light - cone coordinates as @xmath6 where we dropped @xmath7-dependence in the right - moving source and @xmath8-dependence in the left - moving source as usual because of the lorentz time dilatation . then , converting the coordinates from the light - cone variables @xmath9 to the proper - time @xmath10 and the rapidity @xmath11 which are related by @xmath12 , we can express the initial fields right after two nuclei collide as  @xcite @xmath13             + \\bigl [ \\alpha^{(1)}_2 , \\alpha^{(2)}_2 \\bigr]\\bigr ) \\,,\\\\",

    "it should be mentioned that , though the important message from ref .",

    "@xcite is actually devoted to elaborating that @xmath129gev can reproduce the total multiplicity at rhic and then the following energy density is in a reasonable range .",
    "this procedure would make the discrepancy between the analytical and numerical results hidden behind the fitting ; not only the energy density but also the multiplicity is accompanied by the factor @xmath130 .",
    "[ the multiplicity is an integration over the gauge field expectation value divided by the particle dispersion relation . ]",
    "that means that the value of @xmath126 would become @xmath131 times larger in order to fit the total multiplicity without the overall factor @xmath130 , leading to @xmath122 times larger energy density .",
    "consequently , even though the dimensionless coefficient has a substantial factor , the dimensional quantity _ in the physical unit _ remains unchanged .",
    "in other words the saturation model has only one dimensional scale @xmath126 and all the physical quantities are expected to scale with @xmath126 . once @xmath126 is fixed by means of one of the experimental data set , other observables from the model calculation should be all consistent with the whole data set .",

    "our aim is , as emphasized in introduction , to establish a correct _ theoretical _ procedure for the mv model . for that purpose",
    "the phenomenological success is inadequate .",
    "we must treat the mv model scale @xmath126 not as a fitting parameter but as an input deduced theoretically from a given bjorken s @xmath132 .",
    "this is , in principle , possible with the bfkl equation from which the saturation scale @xmath1 is inferred as a function of @xmath132 .",
    "[ the nonlinear extension of the bfkl equation , namely the jimwlk equation , is not necessary for the determination of @xmath133 as concisely explained in ref .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty by higher order corrections is still large , however , and the golec - biernat - wsthof fit multiplied by the atomic number factor @xmath134 is usually regarded as a more trustworthy form of @xmath133 .",
    "then , within the framework of the mv model , the saturation scale can be defined in terms of @xmath126 as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the ir cutoff .",

    "our finding that the longitudinal structure in infinitesimal extent has a significant effect may well be important also for the instability analyses in ref .",
