    "purely two - dimensional models are widely spread in the condensed matter physics at description of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) ( see for instance @xcite-@xcite ) .    in previous section",

    "the last term is the quantum bohm potential .",

    "the spectrum of collective excitations of dipolar fermions with the account of the dipole direction evolution , but with no account of the exchange dipole - dipole interaction , was obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for the three - dimensional systems , and @xcite for the two - dimensional systems .",
    "it is essential to note the differences between spectrum of the quasi two - dimensional and the two - dimensional dipolar fermions ( [ bscf_fer spectrum quasi2d small k ] ) and ( [ bscf_fer spectrum 2d ] ) .",
    "the quasi two - dimensional regime ( [ bscf_fer spectrum quasi2d small k ] ) contains trace of the three dimensional equation of state , being proportional to @xmath212 , while the two - dimensional limit gives @xmath213 .    at the eddy - free motion @xmath214 of the two - dimensional medium of dipolar fermions with the aligned electric dipoles the hydrodynamic equations ( [ bscf_fer cont eq 2d ] ) , ( [ bscf_fer bal imp eq 2d ] ) can be rewritten in the form of the non - linear schrodinger equation @xmath215 @xmath216 the nlse ( [ bscf_fer nlse 2d with exchange ] ) is obtained for the effective macroscopic wave function @xmath217 defined in terms of hydrodynamic variables : @xmath218",
    "the quantum hydrodynamic method for ultracold dipolar fermions descriptions for the aligned dipoles has been developed .",
    "this method describes the electric dipole - dipole interaction as a long - range interaction .",
    "however , the self - consistent field approximation has not been applied in this paper .",
    "we have explicitly considered the two - particle hydrodynamic concentration appearing in the euler equation in the force field of dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we have considered this function in the limit of weak interparticle interaction . at approximate calculation of the two - particle concentration we have explicitly considered antisymmetric n - particle wave function as the slater determinant .",
    "the final result for the force field arises as the sum of two parts : the self - consistent field part and the exchange part .",
    "analysis of the force field shows that the exchange interaction can reach same magnitude as the self - consistent field part .",
    "however the exchange part of the force field strongly depend on distribution of fermions over quantum states .",
    "spin-1/2 fermions at temperatures considerably less than the fermi temperature may occupy one of two spin states . in this case",
    "we can put one fermion in each quantum state in the momentum space , hence fermions occupy all states with the momentum smaller than @xmath219{2}\\tilde{p}_{fe}$ ] , where @xmath220 is the fermi momentum , with the equilibrium particle concentration @xmath221 ( or , in the case of two dimensional plane - like distribution of particles , they occupy all states with the momentum smaller than @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the 2d fermi momentum ) . in this case",
    "we have the fully spin polarised systems of spin-1/2 fermions possessing _ the electric dipole moments_.    the opposite limit case , when pairs of fermions with the opposite spins occupy each quantum state in the momentum space . in this case fermions occupy all states with the momentum smaller than @xmath224 ( or @xmath225 for plane like structure ) . in this case",
    "we have no spin polarisation .",
    "the exchange interaction force monotonically depends on the spin polarisation .",
    "therefore , the exchange force field equals to zero at the zero spin polarisation . while it has maximum value at the full spin polarisation .    considering spin-1/2 atoms and molecules , when all of them located in the same state of the fine structure , we have rather large contribution of the exchange electric dipole - dipole interaction in the euler equation .",
    "this contribution is the same order as the self - consistent field part .",
    "since they have opposite sings ( repulsing self - consistent field part and attractive exchange part ) , they can cancel each other at some conditions .",
    "spectrum of the collective excitations of ultracold electric dipolar fermions contains the positive anisotropic contribution of the self - consistent field part of the dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath226 ) , and the isotropic negative contribution of the exchange part of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "together they give the term proportional `` @xmath227 '' .",
    "if the dipole - dipole interaction dominate over the short - range interaction , then the obtained spectrum shows the famous roton instability .",
    "usually authors obtain the roton instability in dipolar becs and dipolar fermions in the self - consistent field approximation due to consideration of the reduced potential energy of the dipole - dipole interaction , instead of the full potential considered in this paper . here",
    ", the roton instability arises at another angle ( we have `` @xmath227 '' instead of `` @xmath228 '' ) , and it has another physical mechanism , i.e. the exchange part of the electric dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we should note that similar approximation for the dipolar becs does not lead to any instability ( see ref .",
