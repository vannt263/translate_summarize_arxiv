    "stochastic resonance(sr ) is known as a phenomenon in which the presence of noise helps a nonlinear system in amplifying a weak ( under barrier ) signal  @xcite .",
    "the features of systems exhibiting sr seem to be applicable to some natural systems such as sensory neurons , which are noisy and operate as threshold systems . since sr produces an information - transmitting phenomenon , its positive role in the neuronal processes is to be revealed . in fact , a single neuron model described by the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) equations exhibits sr behavior  @xcite and this sr effect is found in the real sensory neurons located in the tail fan of crayfish  @xcite .",
    "the fhn equations driven by white noise and an arbitrary aperiodic signal are also examined in the context of excitable systems with threshold dynamics  @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the sr effect will be more pronounced in an ensemble of systems than in a single system . in view of a collective response of globally coupled bistable systems to periodic forcing ,",
    "a neural network with dynamics of the hopfield type  @xcite is studied , under the assumption that white noise and the periodic signal are identical for all neurons  @xcite .",
    "given the basic three ingredients , that is , a form of threshold , a source of noise and a weak input signal , sr can generally be observed in a large variety of systems .",
    "considering the fact that deterministic chaos resembles the feature of noise and provides a source of fluctuation , we have a natural question whether sr - like behavior can be observed in deterministic dynamical systems in the absence of noise . two different approaches to this problem",
    "are known .",
    "one way is to substitute the stochastic noise by a chaotic source .",
    "this situation in which the chaos is supplied as an additive noise , resembles the conventional setup for sr and yields sr - like enhancement as expected   @xcite .",
    "the other approach is to use the intrinsic chaotic dynamics of a nonlinear map .",
    "no external source is necessary to provide the randomness .",
    "this method generates a sort of activated hopping process which is then synchronized by a weak periodic signal  @xcite .    until now",
    ", diverse types of chaos have been confirmed at several hierarchical levels in the real neural systems from single cells to cortical networks ( e.g. ionic channels , spike trains from cells , eeg )  @xcite . by producing chaos as effective noise spontaneously",
    ", biological systems may enhance their functions through signal amplification .",
    "this scenario is likely to have occurred even in the associative memory dynamics .",
    "the chaotic neural network model  @xcite is known as a framework beyond the hopfield neural network  @xcite with only equilibrium point attractors .",
    "its dynamic retrieving and learning features have been studied  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we set up a signal - driven scheme of the chaotic neural network with the coupling constants corresponding to certain information , and investigate the sr - like effects under its deterministic dynamics , comparing with the conventional case of the hopfield network with stochastic noise .",
    "for n neurons connected by synaptic couplings @xmath2 with @xmath3 , the system ( signal - driven scheme ) is described by @xmath4 where @xmath5 : output of neuron @xmath6 , @xmath2 : synaptic weight from neuron @xmath7 to neuron @xmath8 , @xmath9 : output function defined by @xmath10 with the steepness parameter @xmath11 , @xmath12 : internal potential , @xmath13 : contribution of external input signal .",
    "this form is a simple and possible incorporation of stimuli as the changes of neuronal activity . in the case of chaotic neural network ( cnn )",
    "@xcite , the internal potential is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 : threshold of neuron @xmath16 ) : decay factor for the feedback ( refractoriness ) @xmath17 : refractory scaling parameter .",
    "owing to the exponentially decaying form of the past influence , the dynamics of @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be described as follows : @xmath20 when @xmath21 , the network corresponds to the conventional discrete - time hopfield network ( we call the hopfield network point ( hnp ) ) : @xmath22 we also look into the case that stochastic fluctuations are attached to hnp in eq.(7 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a neuron - independent gaussian white noise defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the noise intensity parameter.we call eq.(8 ) a stochastic neural network(snn ) .",
    "the synaptic configuration @xmath28 is determined by storing pattern information in the network as minima of the computational energy : @xmath29 at hnp .",
    "this is done by using a local iterative learning rule  @xcite for @xmath30 patterns @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 in the following form : @xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the unit step function .",
    "to carry out computational experiments , we consider a network with @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40(unless otherwise stated ) , and use non - orthogonal 20 random patterns @xmath41 as a set of external signal : @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the strength factor of signal .",
    "@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is represented by @xmath46 binary data and a half of @xmath47 s has @xmath48 and the other half has @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 patterns @xmath51 are stored with the above learning rule of eq.(10 ) ( @xmath52 ) , and then the corresponding multi - stable landscape is made on the network dynamics .    as the temporal input signal @xmath53 , we take two kinds of signals .",
    "one is a random train composed of stored patterns @xmath51 ( e.g. @xmath54 $ ] ) with a duration @xmath55 for every pattern and the other is a similar sequence of non - stored patterns @xmath56 .",
    "figure @xmath57 shows typical examples of the results of temporal behaviors of the neural networks to input signal @xmath53 .",
    "an input random train of stored patterns ( @xmath58 ) is given in fig.1(a ) by the relative overlap with pattern @xmath59 : @xmath60 responses of cnn ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) and snn to this signal with strength @xmath63 are shown in fig.1(b ) and ( c ) by @xmath64 in cnn [ fig.1(b ) ] , as we can see from three cases where @xmath65 is @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the performance of output response is largely affected by its refractory scale parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the response fits well the input signal when @xmath65 is @xmath67 . from fig.1(c ) , similar behaviors are observed for snn against the noise intensity parameter @xmath69 and @xmath70 , except for the appearance of noise - driven fluctuations .",
    "to evaluate the coherence between the signal \\{@xmath71 } and the response \\{@xmath72 } , we introduce the correlation coefficient @xmath73 and the discrimination efficiency @xmath74 .",
    "these quantities are defined as @xmath75^{1/2}[\\overline{dev(m_0 ^ 4)^2}]^{1/2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the deviation @xmath78 and the overbar denotes an average over time .",
    "@xmath74 naively means the rate of information transfer from stimulus to response .",
    "the numerical results of @xmath73 and @xmath74 plotted against refractory factor @xmath65 are given in fig.2 , calculated using the temporal data at every different @xmath65 values .",
    "the results for @xmath53 of stored patterns @xmath51 are in contrast with the results for @xmath53 of non - stored patterns",
    "@xmath56 in the range of @xmath65 larger than about @xmath79 wherein the response is hopping out and into a well ( minimum of the energy ) corresponding to a stored pattern state .",
    "this movability causes an increased coherence with stored pattern stimuli . under the same conditions of input signal ,",
    "dependences of @xmath73 and @xmath74 on the noise intensity @xmath27 in snn are examined as shown in fig.3 . between stored and non - stored pattern signals , a quite difference like in cnn is also confirmed . comparing the results for stored pattern signal",
    ", we can see that in cnn there appears a projected plateau for both @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and in this flat region both of their values are kept very close to 1 .",
    "contrary to this , in snn @xmath73 and @xmath74 have gradual variations with @xmath27 and @xmath74 degrades faster than @xmath73 , which seems to be consistent with conventional sr .",
    "this comparison indicates that cnn can cause sr - like phenomena with high performance which can not be attained in snn .    in cnn ,",
    "the stronger the signal strength @xmath43 is , this @xmath65-range of the flat plateau becomes wider .",
    "conversely , this range becomes narrower for weaker @xmath43 .",
    "we illustrate this effect as coherent @xmath65-range versus signal strength @xmath43 in fig.4 , together with the relationship of maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath80  @xcite to @xmath65 when there exists no signal forcing .",
    "as @xmath43 decreases , the @xmath65-range ( @xmath81 ) becomes narrow and at last disappears .",
    "then the @xmath65 value coincides with @xmath82 at the sudden rise point of the lyapunov exponent @xmath80 .",
    "this fact tells that sensitive and flexible responses happen around the boundary between order and disorder , in other words , the edge of chaos  @xcite . at @xmath83 , the refractory term ( @xmath84 ) in eq.(6 ) makes a well ( minimum of the energy ) shallow in effect and helps the input signal drive the network state . on the other hand , at @xmath85",
    "the chaotic attractor is driven by the input signal and stabilized to the corresponding network state .",
    "figure 5 shows return maps of the internal potential @xmath86 for a neuron ( @xmath87 ) in cnn with no signal forcing ( @xmath88 ) when @xmath85 . in the case of @xmath89 ,",
    "the trajectories of @xmath86 are attracted into the region of square ( @xmath90 ) such that controllable by the input signal @xmath63 . when @xmath91 ( a deeper chaotic state ) , however , the trajectories are attracted outward so that chaos can not be suppressed by the input signal @xmath63 .",
    "we have investigated all the above phenomena in other conditions of the parameters and the input signals , and have found similar results and overall tendency .",
    "we have shown that the chaotic neural network can enhance weak subthreshold signals and have higher coherence abilities between stimulus and response than those attained by the conventional stochastic neural network model .",
    "the high coherent response is found to arise around the edge of chaos .",
    "this implies that some of sr phenomena may be realized by the inherent properties of deterministic nonlinear systems without any external noise .",
    "analytical study to explain these results will be important in our future work .",
    "the coherent response concept is expected to be related to researches in cognitive neuroscience from dynamical system viewpoints  @xcite .      for recent reviews ,",
