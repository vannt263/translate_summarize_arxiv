    "the successful deployment of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ has opened many windows for the study of the high redshift universe . in the spectroscopic arena , the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) observation of the luminous radio - quiet qso hs 1700 + 6416 ( @xmath1 = 2.72 ) by reimers et al .",
    "( 1992 ) has provided an extraordinary spectrum which demonstrates the potential of the _ hst _ for the study of high @xmath14 qso absorption lines .",
    "this fos spectrum has yielded results on topics about which little or nothing was known before the launch of the _ hst _ , including ( 1 ) the helium content of qso absorbers at  @xmath15 1.84 , and ( 2 ) an ultra - highly ionized phase of qso absorbers traced by species such as ( see also hamann et al .",
    "1995 ) , which may reveal the presence of gas with @xmath16 k ( verner , tytler , & barthel 1994 ) .",
    "these new topics are observationally challenging because the resonance lines of , , and the ultra - highly ionized species ( e.g. , , , and ) all occur at rest wavelengths @xmath17 912  , and only a handful of qsos are currently known with continuum flux detected at @xmath18 912   ( c.f .",

    "the continua of background qsos with sufficient redshift to show these absorption lines are usually undetectable due to attenuation by intervening absorption , either optically thick lyman limit ( ll ) absorption or the cumulative effect of many absorbers along the line of sight ( c.f . ,",

    "the hs 1700 + 6416 sight line has its share of ll absorbers  seven ll systems are well - detected in the reimers et al",
    ". fos spectrum  but remarkably all of the lls are optically thin ( @xmath19 1 ) and the quasar continuum is detected from @xmath51200 to 3250  , which corresponds to @xmath5320 to 870   in the qso restframe .",
    "in addition to the ground - breaking _ hst _ spectrum , this sight line is intriguing because a deep rosat pspc image obtained by reimers et al .",
    "( 1995a ) shows two extended x - ray sources within a few arcminutes of the qso .",
    "both of these x - ray objects are flagged as greater than 3@xmath20 extended sources by the sharc survey ( see romer et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "one of these x - ray sources is abell 2246 , a galaxy cluster at @xmath14 = 0.225 .",
    "the other extended source is less easily identified and may be a higher redshift galaxy cluster .",
    "the close proximity of these x - ray objects to the sight line offers the tantalizing possibility of studying the detailed properties of galaxy intracluster media detected in absorption in the spectrum of hs 1700 + 6416 .",
    "hs 1700 + 6416 is also an excellent target for ground - based studies of ll absorbers .",
    "since the ll systems in the _ hst _ spectrum are all optically thin , the lyman continuum optical depth can be measured , and this provides an accurate estimate of the column density .",
    "previous studies of ll absorbers ( e.g. , steidel 1990 ) have mostly used samples of optically thick ll systems and have been forced to rely on elaborate methods to estimate @xmath21 ( ) . to study the abundances and physical conditions in ll systems , and to complement space - based programs , we have obtained a high resolution ( fwhm = 20 ) high signal - to - noise optical spectrum of hs 1700 + 6416 , and in this paper we present the data and analyses of the absorption systems . the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the observations and data reduction in  2 and the line selection and column density measurements in  3 . in ",
    "4 we provide some comments on the individual absorption systems including assessments of absorption line saturation . in this section",
    "we also comment on a dense cluster of absorbers at 2.432 @xmath3  @xmath3 2.441 in which the weak lines of some absorbers are well - aligned with the strong lines of different doublets . in  5 we discuss the physical conditions and abundances in the absorption systems . in ",
    "6 we examine the number of absorbers detected per unit redshift including weak absorbers .",
    "after some comments on the abundances derived by vogel & reimers ( 1995 ) from the low resolution fos spectrum in  7 , we summarize the paper in  8 .",
    "the observations and data reduction techniques are fully described in tripp et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; we summarize a few of the pertinent details here .",
    "hs 1700 + 6416 was observed during darktime ( 1820 may 1993 ) with the echelle spectrograph and the t2 kb 2048@xmath222048 ccd on the 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) . with a 1@xmath23 entrance aperture ,",
    "the instrument setup provided a resolution of 20  with @xmath52 pixels / fwhm and spectral coverage from 4300 to 8350   with no gaps between echelle orders .",
    "five one - hour observations were obtained over the course of three nights .",
    "the preliminary data reduction ( overscan and bias subtraction , flatfielding , etc . ) was done with iraf following the standard procedure .",
    "the `` optimal '' spectrum extraction routine described by horne ( 1986 ; see also robertson 1986 ) was used to extract the final spectra from the individual observations , and then the individual spectra were rebinned to the same wavelength scale and coadded .",
    "in addition to the flux spectrum , the optimal extraction program yields a 1@xmath20 error spectrum which includes the contribution from read noise as well as statistical noise , and this error spectrum was propagated throughtout the data reduction and analysis procedures .",
    "the coadded spectrum was normalized by fitting cubic splines to regions free of absorption lines .",
    "overlapping regions of adjacent orders were weighted by their signal - to - noise ratios and coadded .",
    "the final normalized spectrum of hs 1700 + 6416 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the final spectrum ranges from @xmath530 to 70 per resolution element at @xmath24 4550   ( the s / n is somewhat lower within the forest ) .",
    "absorption lines in the hs 1700 + 6416 spectrum were selected for analysis based on the statistical significance of the observed equivalent width @xmath25 .",
    "absorption line equivalent widths were measured using the automated method described in tripp et al .",
    "telluric absorption lines were removed from the line list by comparing the normalized spectrum of hs 1700 + 6416 to the normalized spectrum of hs 1946 + 7658 obtained during the same observing run . since the hs 1700 + 6416 and hs 1946 + 7658 spectra have similar s / n levels and the same resolution , atmospheric absorption lines are effectively removed in a ratio of the two spectra ( see figure 3 in tripp et al .",
    "we have used this ratio of the hs 1700 + 6416 spectrum to the hs 1946 + 7658 spectrum to identify telluric lines _ only _ ; for all other measurements reported in this paper we use the coadded spectrum shown in figure 1 ( which has not been divided by the hs 1946 + 7658 spectrum ) .",
    "table 1 lists all statistically significant ( @xmath26 ) extragalactic absorption lines detected in the kpno hs 1700 + 6416 spectrum . table 1 also lists the heliocentric vacuum wavelength of the centroid of each absorption line and a line number which identifies the absorption line in figure 1 .",
    "identifications of the line species derived from the morton ( 1991 ) finding list are tabulated in column 4 of table 1 , and table 2 summarizes by redshift the heavy element systems we detect in the spectrum of this quasar . we have detected 13 heavy element absorbers in the direction of this quasar , 6 of which also produce detectable lyman limits in the fos spectrum of hs 1700 + 6416 obtained by reimers et al .",
    "there are several absorption features in table 1 for which we could not find positive identifications ( labeled `` uid '' in column 4 of table 1 ) .",
    "most of these unidentified lines are weak ( @xmath27 ) , so they could be the 1548.2    line with the corresponding 1550.8   line falling below our detection threshold . similarly , some of these uids could be the stronger line in the doublet with the weaker line undetected .",

    "however , the complex shown in figure 4 is definitely not a bal system , and it is displaced from @xmath1 by @xmath524000 , so it usually would not be considered an associated system either .",
    "bal outflows do attain velocities this large ( turnshek 1988 ) , so perhaps this complex is close to the qso and was accelerated in an earlier bal outflow that has since mostly dissipated ( a scenario proposed by turnshek 1988 ) .",
    "alternatively , this may be a bal outflow which is just beginning to form with the high velocity absorption showing up first to be followed later by lower velocity absorption with  closer to @xmath1 .    before pursuing these speculations , it is important to ascertain whether or not the doublet alignments in figure 4 could simply be coincidental . if we consider randomly placing some number of absorbers in a specified velocity interval , then we can use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability that the weak line of one absorber could by chance be aligned with the strong line of a different absorber to within some velocity tolerance .",
    "it is not immediately obvious what velocity interval or number of absorbers should be assumed for this calculation , however , and these assumptions significantly affect the probability .",
    "the _ minimum _ velocity interval ( which translates to an _ upper limit _ on the probability ) is the difference between the velocity of the strong line of the highest redshift doublet in the cluster and the velocity of the strong line of the lowest redshift doublet ( if the velocity interval were less than this , then the complex shown in figure 4 would never occur because some of the doublets would be outside of the velocity interval ) .",

    "if we include the second apparent weak / strong line alignment , then we must relax the velocity overlap tolerance to 25 , and we must randomly place at least five absorbers in the velocity interval , so in this case the probability of two chance alignments is 12% .",

    "the case presented by barlow & sargent ( 1997 ) is particularly convincing because the profile has an obvious flat bottom indicative of strong saturation , but the flux in the flat bottom of the profile is well - detected and is not zero .",
    "while quite interesting , this complicates the column density measurements because even if the lines are unsaturated , the incomplete covering will introduce errors in column densities from profile fitting and  integration .",
    "the discrepancy between the 1238.8 and 1242.8   profiles shown in figure 5 could indicate that the absorbing gas does not completely cover the flux source . in principle , one can attempt to correct the absorption profiles for partial covering ( c.f . , hamann et al .",

    "the continuum shape we used in the previous paragraph and in figure 9 ( based on siemiginowska et al . ) provides firm lower limits on [ c / h ] and [ n / h ] because this continuum is the lower limit on the ionizing flux .",
    "there are various corrections which could make the sed harder and hence increase the lower limits on [ c / h ] and [ n / h ] .    finally , we comment that these photoionization models are highly simplified , and there are some indications that the real absorbers are more complicated than the assumed models .",

    "this is not consistent with the assumption that @xmath111 and @xmath71 are the same for the and absorption lines because this would require an unphysical negative temperature .",
    "this suggests that ( 1 ) there is some problem with the doppler parameter measurements or uncertainties , or ( 2 ) the properties of the gas causing the absorption are different from the properties of the gas producing the absorption .",
    "the disparity between @xmath10 ( ) and @xmath10 ( ) can not be blamed on the profile fitting procedure ; attempts to fit the and profiles with compatible @xmath10-values , assuming @xmath111 and @xmath71 are the same , yield unacceptably bad fits . the nitrogen line would be broader than the line if is strongly saturated , but profile fitting should account for such saturation and yield consistent @xmath10-values . therefore in this associated absorber ,",
    "the gas and gas do not have the same non - thermal motions and temperature .",
    "it is possible that the absorption and _ some _ of the absorption occurs in the same gas cloud with additional absorption arising in a separate cloud which does not produce absorption .",

    "<S> we have obtained a high signal - to - noise ( 30 @xmath0 s / n @xmath0 70 ) high resolution ( fwhm = 20 ) spectrum of the radio - quiet qso hs 1700 + 6416 ( @xmath1 = 2.72 ) with the echelle spectrograph on the kpno 4 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 13 metal systems in the optical spectrum of this qso , including six systems with associated optically thin lyman limit absorption in the _ hst _ spectrum obtained by reimers et al . </S>",
    "<S> we use the apparent column density technique and profile fitting to measure the heavy element column densities and to evaluate the impact of unresolved absorption saturation . </S>",
    "<S> profile fitting indicates that four of the systems are narrow with @xmath2 8 , which implies that these absorbers are relatively cool and probably photoionized .    </S>",
    "<S> the dense cluster of doublets at 2.432 @xmath3  @xmath3 2.441 shows the weak line of one absorber apparently aligned with the strong line of a different doublet , i.e. , line locked , for two pairs of absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> line locking has been detected previously in  @xmath4 @xmath1 absorbers where radiation pressure is likely to play a role , but it is surprising in this case since this complex is displaced by @xmath524000  from the qso emission redshift . </S>",
    "<S> this may be the remnant ( or precursor ) of a broad absorption line ( bal ) outflow . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is possible that these alignments are chance alignments rather than true line locking .    </S>",
    "<S> the high ion column density ratios in the multicomponent lyman limit absorber at  = 2.3150 suggest that the ionization conditions in this absorber differ significantly from the conditions in the gaseous halo of the milky way . from photoionization models we derive [ si / h ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 0.95 and [ al / h ] @xmath6 0.96 for the stongest component of this absorber . these are conservative lower limits derived from lower ionization stages only ; photoionization models in agreement with the observed low and high ionization stages require [ m / h ] @xmath4 0.45 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , vogel & reimers derive [ n / h ] @xmath3 1.04 and [ o / h ] = 1.52 for this absorber . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the discrepancy is due to the low resolution of the vogel & reimers data ( fwhm @xmath4 300 ) which introduces serious blending and saturation problems . </S>",
    "<S> the photoionized model with [ m / h ] = 0.45 has a particle density @xmath7 0.02 @xmath8 , a size of a few hundred pc , and a mass of roughly 1 @xmath9 , assuming the absorber is spherical .    </S>",
    "<S> we detect unsaturated and rather strong `` associated '' absorption at  = 2.7125 . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent column density of the weak 1242.8   line is greater than the apparent column density of the stronger 1238.8    line in this absorber , which indicates that the profile is affected by unresolved saturation or that the absorbing gas does not completely cover the qso emission source . </S>",
    "<S> if the latter interpretation is correct , then the associated absorbing gas must be close to the qso . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the observed spectral energy distribution of the qso , corrected for intervening lyman limit absorption , for photoionization modeling of the associated absorber , and we derive [ n / h ] @xmath6 0.65 and [ c / h ] @xmath6 0.82 . other corrections ( e.g. , to account for dust in intervening absorbers or ` lyman valley ' attenuation ) will make the spectral energy distribution harder and increase the metallicity estimates . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> the absorption profiles suggest that the constant density single slab model is too simplistic : we obtain @xmath10 ( ) = 25.2@xmath111.3  and @xmath10 ( ) = 11.4@xmath111.1  from profile fitting , and therefore the gas which produces the absorption does not have the same temperature and non - thermal motions as the gas .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly examine the number of systems detected per unit redshift , and we tentatively conclude that @xmath12 is dominated by weak lines with @xmath13 0.3  . </S>"
