    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are large - scale eruptions of plasma from the sun and are one of the main drivers of space weather , accounting for about 85@xmath2 of intense geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "the occurrence rate of cmes vary with the 11-year solar cycle , from no more than one event a day near solar minimum to as many as 68 cmes per day at solar maximum @xcite .",
    "statistical studies have shown that about 70@xmath2 of front - sided halo cmes observed by coronagraphs result in a geo - effective ejecta at 1  au @xcite , while about 64@xmath2 of ejecta at 1 au for which a source region was identified are associated with cmes within 20@xmath1 of central meridian @xcite .",
    "different methods have been devised to predict whether a cme will hit earth or not and , if yes , to forecast the arrival time . until the launch of the _ solar - terrestrial relation observatory _ ( stereo ) in 2006 , most of these methods relied on information from coronagraph measurements , the flare location and , if available radio bursts .",
    "empirical models , such as the empirical shock arrival ( esa , see : , ) , have been able to predict the arrival time of cmes with typical errors of @xmath3 12 hours .",
    "the twin stereo spacecraft @xcite , launched in november 2006 , have given us continuous views of cmes from the solar surface out to 1  au via the secchi suite @xcite through the use of two coronagraphs ( cor-1 and cor-2 ) and two heliospheric imagers ( hi-1 and hi-2 or his collectively ) .",
    "there are two copies of stereo , a and b , both spacecraft orbit the sun at roughly 1  au moving away from the sun - earth line at about 22.5@xmath1 per year ; stereo - a orbits ahead of earth s orbit and stereo - b orbits behind it . by combining the two his ,",
    "the total field - of - view of the heliospheric imagers range from about 4@xmath1 to 82@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "real - time observations from the hi instruments can be used to predict the arrival time of cmes using highly - compressed `` beacon '' data @xcite .",
    "preliminary studies show that the typical error in the predicted arrival time is reduced to about @xmath3 6 hours .",
    "analyses of the high - resolution scientific data have shown that the arrival times for earth - directed cmes can be reproduced with even lower errors using a range of techniques @xcite .",
    "one of these families of techniques is based on fitting methods following the work of .",
    "the central concept of these techniques is that , assuming a constant velocity and constant direction of propagation , cmes appear as decelerating ( resp . accelerating ) as they propagate away ( resp . towards ) the observing spacecraft .",
    "this apparent deceleration or acceleration can be explained purely from geometrical considerations .",
    "different assumptions regarding the geometrical shape of the cmes can be made , resulting in different techniques .",
    "the fixed-@xmath0 ( f@xmath0 ) fitting method assumes that the nose of the cme is what is being imaged at all times by the his @xcite .",
    "the harmonic mean ( hm ) fitting method assumes that the cme front can be locally described as a circular arc attached to the sun @xcite .",
    "then , the his do not necessarily observe the nose of the cme but instead the tangent to this cme front @xcite . both methods fit observed time - elongation data to analytical functions expressing the elongation angle with respect to time depending on the cme direction and speed .",
    "the two methods were recently compared for some earth - directed cmes @xcite as well as stereo - impacting cmes @xcite and for all the tracks observed by the his from april 2007 to september 2011 @xcite .    at the core of the hm and f@xmath0 techniques",
    "is the assumption that an `` average '' speed and direction can be found which characterize the cme propagation .",
    "previous work have shown that deflection of cmes can be strong in the corona @xcite whereas it is often negligible in the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "the best - fit speed has been used to predict the cme speed at 1  au @xcite ; however , unless the cme speed is indeed constant , the average transit speed should not necessarily match the final speed at 1  au .",
    "cme propagation is affected by the lorentz force , gravity , and aerodynamic drag , however past 20  r@xmath4 , the effect of the lorentz force and gravity are thought to be negligible @xcite .",
    "this implies that the dominant force experienced by cmes is the drag force from the solar wind .",
    "the drag arises from cme interaction with the solar wind , transferring momentum to either speed up or slow down the cme velocity so that it approaches the solar wind speed @xcite .",
    "previous studies with data from secchi and from the solar mass ejection imager ( smei ) have tried to fit cme reconstructed position from white - light measurements with kinematic equations @xcite taking into account the solar wind drag and the lorentz force @xcite .",
    "these studies proved that it is possible to match observations with different physical models .",
    "however , the uncertainty on the cme and model parameters ( drag coefficient , cme direction , cme mass ) and reconstruction techniques is large enough that it is usually not possible to distinguish between different physical models .",
    "recently , combined _ in situ _ measurements about the arrival time and final speed of cmes with observational data from secchi to determine the distance at which the cme drag becomes the dominant force acting on cmes .    here",
    ", we analyze how the varying velocity of a cme affects the fitting methods commonly used to analyze hi observations .",
    "while statistical studies based on real data similar to , and would be an optimal way to tackle this problem , there has not been enough fast cmes to perform such a study .",
    "in addition , a study based on real observations would need to account for the varying solar wind and observational conditions .",
    "therefore , it is somewhat easier to base such a study on analytical or computational methods in order to `` control '' the background solar wind conditions and the stereo observational viewpoint . in a previous study @xcite , we performed a numerical simulation of a moderately fast cme ( @xmath5 800  km  s@xmath6 ) with the space weather modeling framework @xcite and we found that the deceleration yields larger errors for larger viewing angles and can reach @xmath7 for viewing angles of 75@xmath1 . here",
    ", we expand this study to cover more cme speeds and larger viewing angles . in section  2 , we discuss the method used to create time - elongation profiles of cmes and we give a quick overview of the fitting methods tested . in section  3 ,",
    "we first give an example of our analysis for a profile corresponding to a fast cme observed behind the limb before discussing the general results . in section  4",
    ", we draw our conclusions and discuss consequences for future observations of cmes and the use of fitting methods for space weather forecasting .",
    "in order to test the effect of solar wind drag on the derivation of properties of cmes , we first create synthetic time - elongation profiles taking into account the interaction of the cme with the solar wind by solving for the cme position and taking into account a drag term .",
    "then , we fit these profiles with the two common fitting methods to get the cme speed and direction .",
    "below , we outline the procedure to create and fit the time - elongation profiles .",
    "when cmes are observed to large elongation angles , the time - elongation data can be fitted to analytical functions and a single value for the cme speed and direction of propagation can be derived @xcite .",
    "the two most common methods are the fixed-@xmath0 ( f@xmath0 ) fitting of and the harmonic mean ( hm ) fitting of . here",
    ", we use the following notation : @xmath8 is the elongation angle , @xmath0 the direction of propagation , which is assumed to be fixed , @xmath9 the heliocentric position of the observing spacecraft ( stereo ) , @xmath10 the time and @xmath11 the `` average '' speed .",
    "assuming that what is observed is a single plasma element , the relation between elongation and distance of can be inverted to obtain the f@xmath0 fitting relation @xcite :    @xmath12    another simple assumption for what is observed by his , as proposed by and , is as follows .",
    "the cme front can be modeled as a locally circular front with a diameter equal to the distance of the apex ( or equivalently , a front which is anchored at the sun ) .",
    "it is further assumed that the measured elongation angle simply corresponds to the angle between the sun - spacecraft line and the line - of - sight tangent to this circular front . assuming a constant propagation speed and the geometry explained above , the hm fitting relation can be obtained @xcite :    @xmath13    a measured time - elongation profile can be fitted to profiles of calculated elongations given by equations  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .      in order to create synthetic time - elongation profiles ,",
    "the first step is to create time - distance profiles for hypothetical cmes in presence of a drag term .",
    "the force experienced by cmes due to their interaction with the solar wind depends on a large number of factors , including the cme mass and cross - section area , the solar wind density and speed @xcite . here , we use a simplified form of the acceleration ( force by unit mass ) following and : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the acceleration , @xmath16 is the solar wind speed , @xmath17 the heliocentric distance and @xmath18 is a constant related to the drag coefficient .",
    "since we only focus on the propagation of the cmes in the his field - of - view , beyond 0.1  au , we neglect the effect of the gravitational force as well as that of the lorentz force ( see for a discussion of the distance at which the drag term becomes the dominant force acting on cmes ) .",
    "we further assume that the solar wind speed is constant at this distance to a value of 320  km  s@xmath6 , typical of slow solar wind conditions .",
    "we used for @xmath18 one of the values given in : 1.28 @xmath19 ( si units ) .",
    "we chose this value as it gives kinematics and transit time typical of real cmes : a cme with an initial speed ( at 0.1  au ) of 800 km  s@xmath6 takes approximately 60 hours to propagate from 20  r@xmath4 to 1 au , whereas a cme with an initial speed of 1800 km  s@xmath6 takes about 29 hours , value in agreement with typical observations as well as empirical models @xcite .",
    "overall , we are left with a simple differential equation which links the cme speed to the heliocentric distance . @xmath20",
    "a similar equation can be found in and .",
    "we discuss the possible errors associated with our assumption in section  4 .    assuming initial velocities of 200 , 500 , 800 , 1200 , and 1800  km  s@xmath6 , equation  ( 4 ) is solved using a fourth - order runge - kutta method from 20  @xmath21 to 1  au .",
    "this gives profiles of velocity as a function of distance , which are then integrated for time to provide profiles of distance as a function of time .",
    "assuming viewing angles of 15@xmath1 , 30@xmath1 , 45@xmath1 , 60@xmath1 , 75@xmath1 , 90@xmath1 , 105@xmath1 and 120@xmath1 , we derive synthetic time - elongation profiles for each combination of velocity and viewing angle , using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for the f@xmath0 and hm methods respectively .",
    "finally , a sample of points is taken from each profile at equal temporal intervals of 1.5 hours , resulting in 20100 datapoints for each profile , depending on the cme initial velocity .",
    "for simplicity sake , no sampling error was added onto the profiles .",
    "manual sampling has been shown to result in errors of about 25@xmath1 @xcite . because the synthetic time - elongation profiles are created directly using the hm and f@xmath0 equations , there is no error associated with the geometry .",
    "fitting these tracks with the same equations , the difference between the viewing angle and the best - fit angle is purely due to the acceleration / deceleration of the cme as given by equation  ( 4 ) . as we did in",
    ", we also fit the f@xmath0 ( resp .",
    "hm ) with the hm fitting method ( resp .",
    "f@xmath0 method ) to see how the different errors combine or cancel each other .",
    "here , we give an overview of our analysis for two synthetic profiles corresponding to the case of a fast cme observed behind the limb : viewing angle of 120@xmath1 corresponding to the separation between earth and stereo - a in july 2012 and between earth and stereo - b in october 2012 . some stereo - directed cmes ( for example the 2009 december 4 cme ) have been observed remotely beyond 0.5  au with such large viewing angles @xcite .",
    "we expect that 120@xmath1130@xmath1 is the largest viewing angle for which earth - directed cmes will be observed remotely to large enough distances to successfully apply fitting techniques .",
    "figure  1 shows the distance - time and velocity - time profiles of a cme with initial speed at 0.1  au of 1200  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "note that there were at least 15 cmes with similar or faster speeds observed by lasco each year from 1999 to 2004 , half of which were typically halo cmes .",
    "therefore , we can expect that secchi will observe a few ( 2 to 10 ) earth - directed cmes this fast in 2012 . with our solar wind drag model ,",
    "such a cme has a transit time from 20  r@xmath4 to 1  au of 41.8 hours , a final speed of 759  km  s@xmath6 and an average transit speed of 901  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "figure  2 shows the time - elongation points derived from time - distance profile using the f@xmath0 ( left ) and hm ( right ) formulae . for the profile constructed with the f@xmath0 method , the best - fit using the f@xmath0 fitting method is 1330  @xmath3 64  km  s@xmath22 and a direction of 130@xmath23 with respect to the sun - spacecraft line .",
    "the best fit for the same profile but with the hm fitting method is 1169  @xmath3 264  km  s@xmath22 and a direction of 159@xmath24 with respect to the sun - spacecraft line .    for the profile constructed with the hm method ,",
    "the best - fit using the hm fitting method is 1472  @xmath3 90  km  s@xmath6 and a direction of 149@xmath25 .",
    "for the same profile , the best - fit with the f@xmath0 fitting method is 1039  @xmath3 104  km  s@xmath6 and a direction of 104@xmath26 . in both panels",
    ", we also plot the `` expected '' profile for a cme with the same average speed and the same direction as the one used to create the profile .",
    ".initial , final and average speed as well as transit time from 20  @xmath21 to 1  au for the 5 synthetic cmes in our study .",
    "all the speeds are in km  s@xmath6 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now discuss the consequences of the errors in the direction and velocity to predict the cme hit / miss at earth ( or at one of the stereo spacecraft ) and to predict the arrival time ( or equivalently the total transit time ) .",
    "the f@xmath0 method assumes a negligible cme width @xcite . on the opposite ,",
    "the hm method assume a very wide width , so that a cme propagating 90@xmath1 away from the sun - earth line is expected to hit earth . in previous studies @xcite ,",
    "cmes with direction given by any of the two methods within @xmath2720@xmath1 of the sun - earth line have been considered as likely to hit earth .",
    "this takes into consideration the non - zero width of the cmes and the typical uncertainties in the best - fit direction .",
    "hereafter , we use @xmath28 error as the limit for a correct prediction of the hit / miss of a cme from the two fitting methods .",
    "regardless of the speed and the direction of the cme , the error in the direction for tracks created using the fixed-@xmath0 approximation is less than 15@xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the effect of solar wind drag would be relatively negligible to make accurate prediction of the cme hit / miss if the fixed-@xmath0 approximation is the correct one to describe a cme . on the contrary , for a fast and wide cme ( with initial speed greater than 800 km  s@xmath6 ) propagating towards earth more than 90@xmath1 from the observing spacecraft , a miss would be mistakenly predicted by the hm fitting method .",
    "a fast and wide cme propagating more than 20@xmath1 east of the sun - earth line would be predicted by the hm fitting method to hit earth .",
    "these cases when the hm method would fail in its prediction of hit / miss are shown in italic in table  3 .",
    "we then turn our focus on the predicted arrival time . following previous works , we consider that , under the f@xmath0 approximation , each part of the cmes within @xmath28 of the best - fit direction have the best - fit speed , whereas , under the hm approximation , we use the corrected speed given by .",
    "we derive the predicted arrival time even for cmes with best - fit directions more than 20@xmath1 away from the actual direction . for cmes faster than the solar wind speed ,",
    "the hm fits result in lower errors in the arrival times than the f@xmath0 fits , even though the direction is often off by more than 20@xmath1 .",
    "the typical error in the transit time associated with neglecting the change in speed caused by the solar wind drag is about 515 hours .",
    "since the errors are relatively constant independently of the initial speed of the cme , the relative error is large for the fastest cme ( up to 30@xmath2 ) . for the slowest cme ( 200  km  s@xmath6 initial speed ) ,",
    "the relatively small errors in the velocity correspond to large errors ( more than 2 days ) for the predicted arrival time , also corresponding to about 30@xmath2 relative error .",
    "while errors of @xmath5 12 hours are typical for models designed to predict cme arrival times @xcite , it should be understood that there are additional source of errors not captured here , such as the fact that no cme can be exactly described by the hm or f@xmath0 approximation , which could make the typical error in the arrival time even larger .",
    "finally , we quickly discuss the errors for the cross - fitting ( bottom panel of figure  4 ) since the f@xmath0 fit of the hm profile may yield the closest match to the cme direction and average speed as was discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "we find that , in general , these fits result in errors in the arrival times about a factor of 2 lower than that from the direct fits . in effect , two phenomena cancel each other : the hm profiles have less deceleration than f@xmath0 profiles and the physical deceleration adds up to the geometrical deceleration . because of this , synthetic profiles created using the f@xmath0 approximation are best - fitted with the hm fitting method and reciprocally .",
    "this result even holds true for the cmes which experience the least interaction with the solar wind ( 200 and 500  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "it implies that , for real cme tracks , it might be impossible to distinguish between the effect of the non - zero width and the deceleration as these two effects tend to cancel each other .",
    "previous studies have shown that the f@xmath0 and hm methods give similar best - fit values except for cmes propagating towards the observing spacecraft or behind the limb @xcite . here ,",
    "we find that even for cmes propagating behind the limb , the effect of the non - constant cme speed is to make it nearly impossible to assess which model bests represents the cme actual geometry .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the influence of the interaction between coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) and the solar wind to determine the properties ( direction , speed , transit time ) of cmes reconstructed by applying fitting methods of hi observations .",
    "as cmes propagate through the inner heliosphere , their speed gets closer to that of the background solar wind and it should result in errors in any method , which assumes a constant cme speed .",
    "the two main methods of fitting time - elongation profiles obtained from a single hi instruments are the f@xmath0 and hm fitting methods , both of these assume a constant velocity . here , a simplified model for cme propagation through the inner heliosphere has been used to quantify the error that real time - elongation profiles may have due to the interplanetary aerodynamic drag .",
    "we have found that the best - fit speed can not be used in general to represent the average transit speed of the cme or its final speed at 1  au as it is typically done for slow cmes .",
    "this is particularly true for fast cmes observed behind the limb , which is the expected stereo - viewing geometry for geo - effective events in 2012 .",
    "in addition , we have found that the physical deceleration of fast cmes can result in errors in the estimated direction of propagation as large as 15@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 for the f@xmath0 and hm methods respectively .",
    "overall the f@xmath0 fitting method does a better job at predicting the direction of propagation and the average velocity than the hm method when the cme varying speed is included .",
    "this difference is barely noticeable when comparing predicted velocities at small viewing angles and slow initial velocities , but is much greater at higher viewing angles and faster initial velocities .",
    "however , the error in the arrival time ( or transit time ) is nearly identical for the two methods and can reach as high as 12 hours for average to fast cmes .",
    "this is comparable to the errors for existing models @xcite and imply that existing methods may need to be further refined in order to perform real - time space weather forecasting for the fastest cmes .",
    "we also found that the error associated with mis - characterizing the cme geometry ( for example neglecting its width or assuming a too large width ) typically cancels the error associated with neglecting the cme heliospheric deceleration . in previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have tried to compare the f@xmath0 and hm methods to determine for which viewing conditions and types of cmes one approximation is more valid than the other .",
    "the present work tends to question whether such a conclusion can be reached , since we have found that a wide , decelerating cme may be best fitted using an approximation assuming a negligible cme width .",
    "it should be noted that the model used for the solar wind drag , as described in equation 4 , is not the most sophisticated .",
    "it coalesces all effects associated with the cme surface area , the cme mass and the solar wind density into a radial dependence of @xmath29 . in addition , the solar wind speed was assumed to be constant equal to 320  km  s@xmath6 between 0.1 and 1  au .",
    "we believe these two assumptions are still satisfactory for creating time - elongation tracks , and that the main conclusions of our studies would hold with different models of the interaction between the solar wind and cmes ( non - constant speed , snow - plow , etc ... ) . assuming a constant speed is not the only contributor to the error for fitting methods but is part of it . here , we have been able to quantify this error to show how it contributes to the prediction of the arrival at 1  au of cmes .",
    "a better fitting method might include a velocity that changes according to physical models for cme kinematics , although more work is required to determine the best model for solar wind drag or snow - plow and the associated coefficients following studies such as those by , , , , and .",
