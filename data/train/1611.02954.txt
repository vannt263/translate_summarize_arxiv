    "the following small - time asymptotic estimate for @xmath4 was proved as a generalization of results from previous work  @xcite : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the intrinsic distance between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which can be determined from only @xmath2 ( see @xcite or definition  [ def : intrinsic ] below for details ) .",
    "similar small - time asymptotics of transition densities have been studied extensively .",
    "these are usually called varadhan - type estimates , in reference to  @xcite . in particular , that the estimate holds was proved in @xcite for a class of symmetric and uniform elliptic diffusion processes on lipschitz manifolds .",
    "this is one of the most general results .",
    "asymptotics of the form   can be considered as an integrated version of varadhan s asymptotics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the formula to a class of non - symmetric bilinear forms .",
    "specifically , we first assume that @xmath12 mentioned above is expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a first - order derivation operator taking values in a separable hilbert space @xmath15 .",
    "our main object is to obtain small - time asymptotics for a non - symmetric form @xmath16 given by the sum of @xmath17 and the lower - order perturbed term @xmath18 ( see ) .",
    "when the perturbed term is small relative to @xmath19 , the form @xmath16 becomes a lower - bounded bilinear form and has an associated positivity - preserving semigroup @xmath20 on @xmath21 . for measurable sets @xmath10 and @xmath11 having positive and finite @xmath22-measure , let @xmath23 , as before .",
    "we study the conditions on @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 that suffice for the semigroup @xmath20 to have the same integrated varadhan s asymptotics as @xmath4 .",

    ", we introduce conditions that take the observation above into consideration ( see conditions ( b.2)@xmath56 , ( b.2@xmath57 ) , and proposition  [ prop : b2 ] ) and prove the upper estimate under their assumptions ( theorem  [ th : upper ] ) .",
    "moreover , we prove that the lower estimate holds under minimal assumptions on @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 along with the assumption of the validity of the upper estimate ( theorem  [ th : lower ] ) . combining these two results",
    "gives sufficient conditions for the integrated varadhan estimates .",
    "as in the previous studies  @xcite , the proof is purely analytic and only a measurable structure is imposed on the state space .",
    "we remark that even for @xmath58 , that is , even with @xmath16 as a symmetric form , our results are new .    because the proof is long",
    ", we briefly explain the broad ideas of the proof here .",
    "the upper estimate ( theorem  [ th : upper ] ) is proved in the spirit of davies ",

    "solving this inequality and optimizing it with respect to @xmath64 and @xmath61 yields the desired estimate . under the assumptions of our theorem",
    ", however , the perturbed terms can not be controlled .",
    "instead , we define @xmath1 in the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 being chosen suitably .",
    "since @xmath20 can be extended to a semigroup on @xmath69 for @xmath43 near @xmath70 in our setting , @xmath71 is finite for small @xmath49 .",
    "the variable exponent @xmath72 means that the derivative of @xmath1 involves an extra logarithmic term , which suppresses the influence on @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the price to pay for this is that the resulting differential inequality is coarser , in the form @xmath73 .",
    "fortunately , the extra logarithmic term has no influence on the varadhan - type estimate .",
    "introducing a variable exponent is a standard technique for estimating heat kernel densities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but ( unlike in such a context ) @xmath72 is taken to be a decreasing function in this study .",
    "the definition of @xmath1 shown above is valid when @xmath22 is a finite measure ; in general cases , we further need to modify the definition of @xmath1 ( see and ) to avoid some technical obstacles . for this reason ,",
    "we need a series of quantitative estimates , which makes the proof long .",
    "the proof of the lower estimate is based on previous studies  @xcite , but the argument is more complicated due to the perturbed terms and the fact that the semigroup @xmath20 preserves positivity but is not markovian .",
    "we will outline the proof by the following formal argument .",
    "we see the function @xmath74 satisfies the relation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the generator of @xmath77 .",
    "( this identity corresponds to in the actual argument . )",
    "if we assume for argument that the left - hand side converges to @xmath78 as @xmath51 and the last term of the right - hand side is negligible , then the limit @xmath79 of @xmath80 ( if it exists ) will satisfy @xmath81 .",
    "what is actually obtained is an inequality of the form @xmath82 , which implies @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath84 @xmath22-a.e .  on @xmath11 should be satisfied . under these conditions",
    ", we have the formal inequality @xmath85 by the definition of @xmath86 , which is close to the lower - side estimate .",
    "several difficulties , such as that @xmath80 is not necessarily bounded , make it hard to justify this procedure directly . to cope with problems such as the integrability ( or not ) of various terms and the existence ( or not ) of limits , we introduce a nice truncating function @xmath87 and bump functions @xmath88 , and consider @xmath89 in place of @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "note that these cut - off functions are slightly different from those in @xcite in order to deal with the lack of the markov property of @xmath20 .",
    "this modification results in an increasing number of terms in the quantitative estimates as the proof progresses , which makes the proof longer and more technical than without the modification .",

    "in section  2 , we introduce a framework and state the main theorems .",
