    "the luminosities and velocity dispersions of early - type galaxies are strongly correlated : their logarithms follow an approximately linear relation ( e.g. faber & jackson 1976 ) .",
    "there is a long and complicated history of what the slope of this relation is , mainly due to the fact that , if there is intrinsic scatter around this correlation , then there are at least three interesting slopes : that obtained from fitting the mean luminosity at each velocity dispersion , @xmath5 , the mean velocity dispersion as a function of luminosity , @xmath6 , and the slope of the principal axis of the joint distribution of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( e.g. lynden - bell et al . 1988 ; saglia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the first of these allows one to use @xmath8 to predict @xmath7 , whereas the second must be used if one wishes to predict @xmath8 from @xmath7 . until recently ,",
    "authors were not careful to distinguish between these cases .    because @xmath7 depends on the distance to the source , whereas @xmath8 does",
    "not , it is straightforward to estimate @xmath9 from flux limited samples ; naive estimates of the other two correlations are compromised by selection effects .",
    "most studies of this correlation , based on local samples , agree that the typical velocity dispersion at fixed luminosity , @xmath9 , scales as @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "the common unfortunate abuse of jargon is to say that luminosity scales as the fourth power of velocity dispersion ; in fact , @xmath12 is considerably shallower . in what follows ,",
    "we will be almost exclusively concerned with how well @xmath7 can be used as a predictor for @xmath8 : @xmath9 .",
    "prior to the year 2000 , studies of the @xmath2 correlation were restricted to local samples ( from within about 50 mpc ) containing @xmath13 objects .",
    "the sdss provided a sample of early - type galaxies that was larger by about two orders of magnitude ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003a ) : @xmath14 objects drawn from a volume which extended to considerably larger distances ( median redshift @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath2 relation in this sample , @xmath16 with an intrinsic scatter of about 0.07  dex is inconsistent with that found in local samples .",
    "for example , at @xmath17 , the relation which forbes & ponman ( 1999 ) found best fits the pruniel & simien ( 1996 ) sample of 236 local early - type galaxies differs from the sdss fit by more than 0.05  dex . expressed in terms of absolute magnitudes , the fits differ by more than 0.5  mags at @xmath18 .",
    "this is substantially larger than expected given the measurement errors .",
    "what causes this difference ?    because the sdss luminosities and velocity dispersions are obtained from an automated pipeline , ( i.e. , light profiles and spectra were not inspected individually ) , it may be that , say , the sdss measurements differ systematically from those estimated for local objects in the literature .",
    "indeed , it is known that the sdss photometric reductions underestimate the luminosities of objects in crowded fields ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "2005 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2006a ; hyde et al .",
    "2006 ; lauer et al .",
    "see the appendix for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the appendix also shows that the sdss also slightly overestimates the velocity dispersions at small @xmath8 . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to the sample in which these systematics have been accounted - for as the sdss - b06 sample ( see the appendix ) . in the sdss - b06 sample , @xmath19 with intrinsic scatter of 0.07  dex",
    "; it happens that this is not very different from the relation obtained by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "a common problem from which all local samples suffer is that , while the apparent magnitude of an object can be measured quite accurately , the absolute magnitude is more difficult because it depends on the distance to the galaxy .",
    "the true distance is difficult to measure because the redshift , which is usually well - determined , is a combination of the distance to the galaxy and the component of its peculiar velocity which is directed along the line of sight to the observer : @xmath20 .",
    "typical velocities are expected to be of order a few hundred km  s@xmath21 , so the redshift is a reliable distance indicator only beyond about @xmath22mpc .",
    "most of the objects in the sdss lie well beyond this distance , whereas all local samples are shallower .",
    "thus , a legitimate concern is whether uncertainties in estimating the true distance are driving the difference between the sdss measurement and those which are based on more local samples .    to address such concerns ,",
    "we have studied the @xmath2 relation in the definitive sample of nearby early - type galaxies  that assembled in the enear database ( da costa et al .",
    "2000 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2002a ; alonso et al .",
    "2003 ; wegner et al .",
    "enear contains about 1000 objects out to 7000  km  s@xmath21 , for which measured redshifts and estimated distances are available .",
    "section  2 shows how the @xmath9 relation changes if one uses the redshift rather than the estimated distance when computing @xmath7 .",
    "it highlights the fact that , if @xmath8 played a role in determining the distance , e.g. if the distance comes from a fundamental plane or @xmath1 analysis , then the @xmath2 relation may be biased . in section  3",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "the first part of this section compares various determinations of the local @xmath2 relation .",
    "the second part compares these determinations with that from the sdss - b06 .     and @xmath8 in the enear sample .",
    "when @xmath7 has been estimated using a distance which has been corrected for peculiar motions .",
    "short dashed line shows @xmath23 . using the redshift as distance indicator instead leads to the @xmath24 relation shown as the solid line .",
    "the symbols and lines show the result of using total rather than bulge luminosities for enear . ]      the enear sample ( da  costa et al .",
    "2000 ) is approximately magnitude limited to 14.5 in the b band .",
    "the catalog provides new apparent magnitudes , @xmath25 measurements , redshifts , and velocity dispersions for about 1000 early - type galaxies distributed over the whole sky out to about 7000  km  s@xmath21 .    in principle , estimating @xmath26 in the enear sample is straightforward because the enear team has also published a measurement of the @xmath1 correlation : @xmath27 ( bernardi et al .",
    "2002b ) , with a scatter of 0.2/ln(10 )  dex .",
    "here , @xmath25 is that angular scale within which the average surface brightness in the r@xmath28 band is 19.25  mag@xmath29arcsec@xmath30 . for reasons we describe below , we compute luminosities for the enear galaxies based on two different distance estimates .",
    "one uses this @xmath1 relation to estimate ` true ' distances , and the other uses the redshift as a distance indicator ( i.e. , this second distance estimate ignores peculiar velocities )",
    ". we will refer to the associated luminosities as @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , for ease of comparison with the sdss , we shift all magnitudes from enear @xmath33 to sdss @xmath34 .        the joint distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath31 which results from using the @xmath1 distance estimate ( filled circles ) is shown in figure  [ locallv ] .",
    "here we only show galaxies which have both spectroscopy and photometry observed by the enear team ( i.e. we did not include measurements listed in the enear catalog which were compiled from previous work ) .",
    "in addition , we selected galaxies with disk - to - bulge ratio smaller than 0.5 and used the total magnitude listed by alonso et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( using the bulge luminosity the results only slightly change ) .",
    "dashed line shows @xmath35 which best - fits the sample .",
    "comparison with equation  ( [ sdssvl ] ) shows that this relation is considerably steeper than in the sdss .",
    "the observed scatter around this relation is @xmath36  dex .",
    "this is about 0.01  dex larger than what sdss reports as intrinsic scatter .",
    "this is remarkable , because enear ought to be carrying distance errors of about twenty percent .",
    "these errors ought to translate into increased scatter of 0.43  mags along the x - axis of figure  [ locallv ] .",
    "if not accounted - for ( and the fit above does not ) , this should have artificially decreased the slope and increased the scatter of the @xmath26 correlation .",
    "e.g. , adding this scatter to the sdss numbers would have decreased the magnitude of the slope by about fifteen percent , and the rms scatter around the new relation would have been about fifteen percent larger .",
    "since the @xmath1 estimate of the distance is only good to 20 percent , one might well wonder if samples like enear reach distances at which the redshift itself provides a more reliable estimate of the true distance than relations like @xmath1 or the fundamental plane .",
    "this will happen on scales @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "this suggests that , beyond about @xmath40mpc , the redshift may actually be a better estimate of the true distance even if typical line - of - sight peculiar velocities were as high as 1000  km  s@xmath21 .",
    "since enear straddles this distance regime , we have studied what happens to the @xmath2 relation when the redshift itself is used as an estimate of the distance  i.e .",
    ", no correction is made for the peculiar velocity .",
    "the inferred relation , when the total luminosity is used , @xmath41 is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ locallv ] .",
    "the relation obtained when the total luminosity is scaled to the bulge luminosity @xmath42 is shown as the dotted line .",
    "the two relations are similar .",
    "equation  [ enearztot ] is considerably shallower than @xmath23 ( equation  [ eneard ] ) , with substantially larger scatter ( 0.12  dex ) .",
    "comparison of the relation based on redshift , @xmath43 say , with the one based on distances , @xmath44 , shows that the scatter appears to decrease considerably when using the distances rather than the redshifts . while it is tempting to conclude that this is signalling that the distance indicator is accurate , this is not the full story .",
    "after all , the @xmath1 distance estimate is actually a function of @xmath8 : distance  @xmath45 . as a result",
    ", @xmath8 appears in both axes of figure  [ locallv ] , with the x - axis proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , scatter in the relation will be correlated along a line which has slope @xmath47 .",
    "a slope of @xmath48 is not far - off the one actually observed .",
    "hence , it may be that the relation shown in figure  [ locallv ] and quantified by equation  ( [ eneard ] ) is both biased and artificially tight .",
    "note that similar concerns would also apply to the use of fundamental plane - based distance estimates ( such as those used by pruniel & simien 1996 ) , since the coefficient of the velocity dispersion in the direct fit is also @xmath49 ( e.g. jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 ; bernardi et al .",
    "this discussion provides another reason why the simple procedure of using the redshift as the distance indicator might actually be the preferred one .      to better understand the effect of using a @xmath8-based distance estimate on the @xmath2 relation",
    ", we constructed a mock catalog of the enear sample .",
    "this was done by _ assuming _ that the joint distribution in luminosity , size and velocity dispersion for enear galaxies is the same as for sdss - b06 galaxies , so we could simply follow the steps described by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003b ) . we then added gaussian noise with dispersion equal to the enear observational estimates , and applied the enear apparent magnitude and redshift cuts .    since this method allows us to generate both @xmath7 and a half - light radius @xmath50 , the assumption that the light profile is devaucoleur allows us to compute a value of @xmath25 for each mock galaxy .",
    "we then fit for the @xmath1 relation , finding that it had slope 1.15 , zero - point 1.4 and rms scatter 0.1  dex .",
    "these values are rather similar to equation  ( [ dnsigma ] ) , suggesting that our mock catalog is actually rather realistic .",
    "figure  [ mocklv ] compares the @xmath44 and @xmath43 relations in the mock catalog ; the relation based on the distance indicator is clearly steeper and tighter than the one based on the redshift , just as in the enear sample itself .",
    "moreover , notice that the slope of @xmath23 relation is clearly steeper than the input slope , whereas @xmath24 is in rather good agreement with the input relation .",
    "this suggests that equation  ( [ enearztot ] ) is closer to the true relation for enear galaxies than is equation  ( [ eneard ] ) .",
    "this bias does not depend strongly on the range of apparent magnitudes in the sample .",
    "it does depend on the intrinsic distribution of the absolute magnitudes .",
    "when the absolute magnitude range is large then the slope of the @xmath44 relation is closely related to that of the @xmath1 relation ( see discussion in previous subsection ) and has little scatter .",
    "however , when the luminosity function is narrow ( i.e. sharply peaked ) then the @xmath44 relation shows larger scatter : while the slope is still biased it is less easily related to that of the @xmath1 relation .",
    "the analysis above suggests that the @xmath43 relation in enear , and , by extension , other local samples , are likely to be more reliable than the local @xmath44 relations .",
    "figure  [ localvlz ] shows the joint distribution of @xmath32 and @xmath8 in the enear sample when the luminosity is computed using the redshift distance ; i.e. , the distance has not been corrected for peculiar motions .",
    "the dashed line shows equation  ( [ enearztot ] ) , and the dotted line shows the result of using bulge rather than total luminosities for enear .",
    "these fits should be compared to the solid line , which shows the sdss - b06 relation ( equation  [ sdssvl ] ) , for which the redshift is an excellent indicator of the true distance .",
    "note that the enear and sdss - b06 samples are in excellent agreement , suggesting that correcting for peculiar motions in local samples can lead to serious biases in correlations which involve @xmath8 .",
    "we showed that the enear @xmath44 relation , where @xmath31 indicates that the luminosity is based on a distance estimate which has been corrected for peculiar motions , is almost certainly biased .",
    "this is because the distance indicator used to estimate @xmath31 depends on @xmath8 .",
    "we also showed that if the redshift is used as the distance indicator ( i.e. , no correction for peculiar motions is made ) then the resulting @xmath43 relation , while noisier , is less likely to be biased .",
    "the enear @xmath43 relation is in excellent agreement with that measured in the sdss , where neglecting peculiar velocities is an excellent approximation .",
    "thus , it appears that the discrepancy between the sdss @xmath2 relation and that in local samples is due to the use of a distance indicator which correlates with @xmath8 .",
    "our results are of particular interest for the problem of estimating black hole abundances from the observed distribution of luminosities or velocity dispersions ( e.g. yu & tremaine 2002 ; shankar et al .",
    "2004 ; tundo et al .",
    "the first method requires @xmath51 whereas the second requires @xmath52 .",
    "the two approaches will only give the same estimate of @xmath53 if the @xmath54 relation of the black hole sample is the same as that of the sample from which the luminosity function @xmath55 and velocity dispersion function @xmath56 are drawn .",
    "current black hole samples are relatively local , so their @xmath2 correlations are very different from that of the sdss .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "( 2006b ) suggests that current black hole samples are biased towards objects with abnormally large velocity dispersions for their luminosities .",
    "if this is a selection rather than physical effect , then the @xmath3 and @xmath4 relations currently in the literature are also biased from their true values .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "find that the bias in the @xmath52 relation is likely to be small , whereas the @xmath51 relation is biased towards predicting more massive black holes for a given luminosity .",
    "therefore , the estimate based on the velocity function ( e.g. that of sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) is to be preferred .",

    "the estimates are generally in good agreement , suggesting that sdss - b06 velocity dispersions are unlikely to be systematically biased with respect to local samples .",
