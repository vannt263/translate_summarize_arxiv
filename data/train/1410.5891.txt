    "quantum computation is the up most application goal of quantum mechanics .",
    "while this goal could be reached , in parallel , other useful appliances based on quantum information are being effectively developed and obtained , as cryptography and teleportation .",
    "quantum gate array computation is the most common and clear approach in terms of proximity with classical computer science .",
    "this proximity has made that some concepts and specially some gates had been replicated from classical programming .",
    "nevertheless , this gates should be reproduced by several physical interactions and resources as ion traps and electromagnetic cavities @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and spins @xcite , thus as its translation is not always immediate , requiring complex control or iterative procedures .",
    "ising model @xcite can be used as a simple approach between interaction of magnetic quantum objects ( electronic gases , quantum dots , ions , etc . ) .",
    "nielsen @xcite was the first reporting studies of entanglement in magnetic systems based on a two spin systems driven with an external magnetic field .",
    "one of the properties of this model is that it generates entanglement , which is one of the interesting properties of quantum mechanics noted since early times @xcite .",
    "this property is a central aspect in the most of quantum applications improving capacity and speed information processing @xcite . in this sense",
    ", entanglement is an important aspect to codify and manage information with alternative methods to those of classical computer science , since fundamental proposals in quantum computation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and teleportation @xcite .",
    "control of entanglement in its several variants can be achievable in ising model through of driven magnetic fields being introduced on the physical system .",
    "nevertheless some complex studies about this interaction in multipartite cases ( some of them numerical more than analytical because of its complexity when number of parts grown ) , is still useful comprehend how this useful model could be used to reproduce efficient procedures in a couple of qubits at time to reproduce some basic elements in quantum gate array computation .",
    "different models of ising interaction ( xx , xy , xyz depending on interest of each author and physical systems being considered ) are used to reproduce effects related with bipartite or multipartite systems @xcite and quantum dots @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays , quantum gate array computation is being experimentally explored in terms to adapt it to stuff in which it can be settled in terms particularly of noise control and reproduction of basic gates .",
    "it means , interactions able to be considered to reproduce it @xcite .",
    "some examples are quantum dots or electronic gases , which are developments towards a scalable spin - based quantum computer which can be controlled with electromagnetic interactions between neighboring spins , being believed able to obtain universal quantum operations @xcite in terms of divincenzo criteria @xcite about reliability of state preparation , identification of well identified qubits and accurate quantum gate operations .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze how a set of anisotropic ising model interactions recently reported @xcite can be applied to reproduce gates in terms of algebraic factorization driven by inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "this factorization could be useful in quantum simulation to reproduce the evolution of a desired computational problem in order to solve it .",
    "one central aspect of this implementation is that analysis of dynamics is constructed on the non - local basis of classical bell states which becomes outstanding by its regular algebraic structure , which fits to desired factorization presented here .",
    "the use of magnetic systems as quantum resources is a traditional basis on which quantum applications could be settled . since quantum memories to quantum processors are considered as stuff for quantum computation or quantum information ( so they are a matter susceptible of magnetic control processing ) . as a simple model of interaction , ising model brings an easy basis to generate and manipulate quantum states and entanglement particularly . in this model , as is shown in figure [ fig0 ] , two qubits interact via ising interaction with additional local magnetic fields as driven elements .",
    "recently , some results about anisotropic ising model generalizes their treatment and suggest an algebraic structure when is depicted on bell basis @xcite . following that work , we focus on the following hamiltonian for the bipartite anisotropic ising model including an inhomogeneous magnetic field restricted to the @xmath0-direction ( @xmath1 corresponding with @xmath2 respectively ) :    @xmath3    which includes several models considered in the before cited works .",
    "following definitions and notation in @xcite :    @xmath4    being @xmath5 a cyclic permutation of @xmath6 and with pair @xmath7simplified by @xmath8 . as in @xcite , we introduce the scaled parameters :    @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and a nomenclature based on different subscripts than those inherited by the computational basis : greek scripts for @xmath10 or @xmath11 , for scripts in states and operators ( meaning @xmath10 in mathematical expressions respectively ) ; capital scripts @xmath12 for @xmath13 as in the computational basis ; and latin scripts @xmath14 for spatial directions",

    "this group structure is essential in the current work because it assure the existence of solutions for factorization ( here , we are simplified the notation for @xmath28 as was used in @xcite by @xmath29 only ) .",

    "but clearly , as each @xmath91 is unitary too , then its block off diagonal in columns and rows are eliminated until this step .",
    "last property repeats for each column eliminated in spite of @xmath92 definition :    @xmath93    then , with that :    @xmath94    the way to fulfill ( [ det ] ) is open in principle , but it can be used to fit specific requirements in the construction of each @xmath79 . finally , the main result of this section is that :    @xmath95    where symbol @xmath96 states that product is the forward product which stacks factors from left to right .",
    "it procedure means that some unitary gate or interaction could be reproduced by a series of @xmath42unitary matrix @xmath97 if it is possible give the adequate form to each one .",

    "for @xmath52 order for matrix evolution , as was written in last section , @xmath100 , it means that at least , they have the form of ising evolution matrices when they are written in bell basis .",
    "in particular in the process depicted , only @xmath101 and @xmath102 are useful to reduce them in those forms , which have the structure of matrices @xmath97 .",
    "now , the challenge is to analyze if sector ( [ sector ] ) could be fitted to ( [ sectorpgral ] ) and their subsidiary requirements .    by reviewing sectors to fit , ( [ sector ] ) and ( [ sectorpgral ] ) ,",
    "comparing entries in @xmath103 with entries in @xmath104 we get the following set of equations for each entry :    @xmath105    so we find a faithful concordance .",
    "the first requirement appears by comparing equations of sectors @xmath106 with @xmath107 , and @xmath108 with @xmath109 too :    @xmath110    with that , only equations for sectors @xmath106 and @xmath109 should be solved . yet , because of ( [ det ] ) , in agreement with forms in ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) and the process previously depicted , the following global restriction should be fulfilled :    @xmath111    with @xmath112 . here , the subscripts @xmath113 are related with the entry being eliminated . in spite of first equation in ( [ evloop1 ] ) should be fulfilled in order to fit the remaining sector to the identity ( by changing @xmath114 by @xmath115 in ( [ evloop1 ] ) ) , then @xmath116 becomes an integer multiple of @xmath117 , so ( [ global ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "nevertheless of last general explanation , clearly since beginning we can note that @xmath27 in ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) is in @xmath25 , then obviously @xmath118 and condition ( [ global ] ) is fulfilled easier . as a consequence , this procedure based on ising interactions only can generate @xmath60 , being consistently with them .    if @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( note that a phase different from zero applies only for @xmath121 , the first element to be eliminated in the bottom of each column ) , then by splitting the restrictions for phases and magnitudes we find the next three equivalent conditions :    @xmath122    this procedure implies to solve these equations for the non diagonal sector combining them with identity sector requirements in each @xmath42unitary matrix of ( [ muproduct ] ) in order to fit them to adequate forms ( [ pmat4 ] ) .",
    "thus , each matrix becomes an evolution boost obtained by means of magnetic field pulse of specific duration in the ising hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure fails to give solutions in spite of ( [ secequations1pd ] ) , which can not be fulfilled . because @xmath123 and the remaining sector should be reduced to @xmath124 , in agreement with @xcite , @xmath125 , with @xmath126 , being @xmath127 .",
    "then for @xmath128 it is impossible that @xmath129 or the specific value required by @xmath130 .    for @xmath131 , equation ( [ secequations1pd ] )",

    "these ranges are fixed for each value of @xmath144 independently of intervals @xmath145,n \\in { \\mathbb z}^+$ ] .",
    "thus , when @xmath142 increases , it is more difficult that ( [ secequations1pc ] ) and ( [ secequations1pd ] ) be fulfilled in general because range of @xmath141 shrinks .",
    "in addition , as for real entries case , equation ( [ secequations1pc ] ) requires that @xmath146 or @xmath147 ( then @xmath148 ) .",
    "first restriction is impossible except for @xmath149 ( which is not useful ) and second one is only applicable for partially anisotropic or isotropic interactions ( @xmath150 ) . in this last case ,",
    "@xmath151 , so matrices @xmath152 and @xmath153 can be constructed with this particular case for ising interaction with driven magnetic fields in @xmath154direction .",
    "additional prescriptions are given by ( [ evloop1 ] ) , by changing @xmath114 with @xmath155 in agreement with ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) for diagonal sector in @xmath102 to fit it to @xmath156 .",
    "for non diagonal sector with @xmath157 , it is required that @xmath158 , @xmath159 ( which could be a possible strong restriction because @xmath160 ) and :    @xmath161    where election of inverse for sine function should be selected in order to fulfill previous relations for signs of @xmath162 .",
    "summarizing , one pulse solutions are in the most cases unable to generate a set of ising evolutions which become factors of a general unitary operation .",
    "thus , more complex schemes should be analyzed .      as was shown in @xcite",
    ", evolutions given by ( [ mathamiltonian ] ) form a lie group and in addition , two combined pulses let to get any @xmath30 element for each sector ( more precisely , two @xmath163 consecutively sectors can reproduce any @xmath164 element already considering ( [ global ] ) ) . here , one sector ( @xmath115 ) should be driven to @xmath165 while remaining sector ( @xmath114 ) reproduces the @xmath42unitary matrix as part of factorization presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , is warranted that two pulses should to generate matrices ( [ pmat4 ] ) .",
    "when we combine two pulses , the generic form of combined sector is :    @xmath166    as is reported in @xcite . repeating the process as in the one pulse case , the only relevant equations for non - diagonal sector @xmath114 desired in @xmath167 are those for the entries :    @xmath168    and as before",

    "resultant equations :    @xmath197    involves several parameters , but states the general procedure to obtain matrix factors .",

    "fortunately , this case exhibit an analytical easier solution which is depicted in this section in terms of theory previously developed until here .      to obtain @xmath229 and @xmath230 , we have as restriction , the impossibility depicted in section [ iva ] for one pulse : to have all entries as real because factors @xmath231 in antidiagonal entries .",
    "an alternative is try to get all entries as imaginary , which is possible by select @xmath232 . with this selection",
    ", we get for non diagonal sector :    @xmath233    unfortunately , the impossibility remains because still , @xmath66 factor can not be eliminated by selecting @xmath234 as imaginary , because it requires be real in order to remaining diagonal sector becomes @xmath165 .",
    "thus , analysis with two pulses shows that solutions are possible .",
    "effectively , we can analyze this problem in terms of general procedure in section [ ivb ] stating @xmath235 with which we find several analytic solutions .",
    "one of them is useful here , but in this case , that solution is easier achievable by taking two pulses @xmath236 with form ( [ sectorh1 ] ) , to obtain :    @xmath237    in which the uncomfortable factor @xmath66 clearly disappears . here , @xmath238 .",
    "still , the following equations should be solved in order to get @xmath239 :    @xmath240    where @xmath241 retrieve all integer constants which appears in the procedure .",
    "terms @xmath242 , for short , correspond to entries in each matrix @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that those equations can be reduced to first one by noting that @xmath243 . at end",
    ", both equations just require a review about concordance in signs .",
    "parameters in @xmath244 can be selected to obtain this concordance .",
    "still , it is required to write @xmath245 in terms of @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "then , by substituting them in first equation in ( [ tp ] ) :    @xmath248    all in terms of @xmath249 . as before ,",
    "nevertheless that we will not introduce time explicitly here , it is convenient note that definitions introduced in ( [ teqs ] ) for non dimensional time @xmath250 are prevailing to report specific results in terms of non dimensional parameters @xmath251 without involve physical parameters @xmath252 . at this point , note that for diagonal sector :    @xmath253 , we define @xmath254 .",
    "signs in @xmath255 are physical prescriptions and there are not restrictions in signs of @xmath256 . in further applications ,",
    "we assume these formulas for two pulse case in order to obtain diagonal sector complementary prescriptions , which will not be explicitly reported because they need @xmath257 specification .",
    "thus , both equations ( [ solh1 ] ) and ( [ eq ] ) require be solved simultaneously for @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "this problem reduce to solve a quadratic equation whose solutions can be expressed as :    @xmath260    where solutions should be selected by reviewing correct signs in both equations ( [ solh1 ] ) together with election of signs in @xmath239 .",
    "last means that there are not necessarily correspondence between signs in both formulas ( [ solh2j ] ) . at end",
    "is possible to find all parameters involved to generate @xmath97 by means of @xmath102 .",
    "formula ( [ solh2jm ] ) should be analyzed more carefully , because @xmath261 , then a detailed view to current set of formulas shows that while existence of solutions in ( [ solh2j ] ) depends on greater values for @xmath262 .",
    "but at time , @xmath263 values increase with this .",
    "thus , some control could be required to have lower values of @xmath264 .      as was stated before",
    ", this case admits an easy solution in just one pulse by selecting @xmath265 ( requiring strictly control on @xmath266 value ) .",
    "independently of possible experimental restrictions to manipulate @xmath266 values , this selection gives a practical solution for non diagonal sector :    @xmath267    in terms of parameters of section [ iva ] .",
    "it implies to obtain @xmath39 and @xmath268 from ( [ evloop1 ] ) in order to obtain @xmath165 in remaining diagonal sector and then solve :    @xmath269    to obtain @xmath270 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to equation ( [ prescription1p ] ) .",
    "this procedure works to obtain @xmath271 .",
    "no more solutions in two pulses are able because they require the same condition @xmath272 in order to have the form ( [ sectorpgral ] ) . in order to report results in terms of non dimensional parameters and because here @xmath272 , terms as @xmath273 are not appropriate .",
    "thus , we introduce the variables @xmath274 as in ( [ evloop1 ] ) with @xmath275 , and @xmath276 ( the equivalent expression for ( [ solh2 ] ) in these terms is immediate ) to report results for sector @xmath114 in which is located the non diagonal sector . for diagonal identity sector ,",
    "@xmath115 , the use of @xmath258 is still appropriate and it can be written as @xmath277 , where as for two pulses case : @xmath278 . as is usual ,",
    "@xmath279 and its sign can be selected arbitrarily .",
    "we will assume these formulas for one pulse case to obtain and report complementary diagonal sector prescriptions ( with exception of @xmath280 ) .",
    "formulas for @xmath131 are easy and their only issue is the restriction @xmath147 which implies some control in the interaction strength of interaction ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "in addition , the correct election of signs depicted in formula ( [ solh2 ] ) is a trivial issue because of properties of trigonometric functions .    for @xmath128 ,",
    "lots of parameters appear as in the general case for complex entries , but as we are shown , analytical solutions are possible . as values of @xmath281 , signs of @xmath213 are not eligible because they are physical constants of system . still , by example , if @xmath282 then @xmath283 ; instead , if @xmath284 then @xmath285 .",
    "similar conditions let the same for @xmath286 .",
    "then , a brief analysis shows that this expressions let obtain both signs for @xmath213 by an adequate selection of @xmath287 and @xmath288 both odd .",
    "normally , it is possible note that changing signs in @xmath289 implies a sign change in @xmath213 solutions .",
    "in addition , solutions are physically meaningful ( @xmath290 ) if we select higher values for @xmath291 because it reduces @xmath292 values . by these reasons , normally large values in @xmath293 do not give physical solutions .",
    "as was mentioned before , last election could give @xmath294 because @xmath295 and @xmath296 values increases .",
    "this could be avoided if @xmath297 can be manipulated .    in the following section",
    "a couple of examples will be developed to shown how the procedure of factorization presented can be implemented .",
    "next examples show applications of previous development by factorizing some special unitary matrices in @xmath25 which are not achievable for exclusive interactions in only one group @xmath225 , instead by a combination of elements of three groups .",
    "results in @xcite and this work establish that a general operation @xmath60 can be reproduced by a finite product of elements in @xmath298 ising interactions via factorization proposed in @xcite .    in the following analysis",
    "we will assume that factorization is being developed by a system with some physical properties as : a ) interaction strength constants positive ( or zero if is required ) , @xmath299 , b ) relative strength ratios were set as @xmath300 .",
    "this setting is just to report concrete results more than real restrictions , which , as was discussed , are not present ( with exceptions of @xmath301 to get factors for @xmath131 case ) . because multiplicity of solutions in terms of several parameters involved @xmath302 ( or some of their associated values as @xmath303 ) , normally we are selected the lower ones possible .",
    "they are included in the prescriptions .",
    "note finally , in particular , that because of definitions of @xmath304 , they can become negative ( no in present case with @xmath299 positive ) , remembering that they are no physical time and positiveness of @xmath245 is always recovered .",
    "@xmath305 gate is a very common and useful gate used in quantum computation . a similar gate with determinant @xmath71 is the controlled gate @xmath306 .",
    "this gate can be reproduced in the present scheme noting that this gate , in bell basis ( [ bellnotation ] ) , has the form :    @xmath307    @xmath305 is a gate sometimes difficult to reproduce , but @xmath306 is an alternative for this case , which could be generated with physical processes as in the current work through magnetic pulses .",
    "quantum algorithms using @xmath305gates could be traduced in terms of @xmath306 . following the process depicted in the previous sections",
    ", we can decompose it in several parts by means of factorization in terms of a set of @xmath42unitary matrices achievable by physical interactions .",
    "thus , their @xmath42unitary matrix factors and respective design parameters are shown in table [ tabla1 ] in those terms presented in last section .",
    ".factorization in @xmath42unitary matrices for @xmath306 and design parameters of non diagonal sector .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this example shows that for a general characterization matrix :    @xmath308    will exist a process of quantum modeling based on factorization . a rich research field",
    "based on power bounded and power convergence for unitary matrices is open , in order to control this procedures when they are based on ising pulses .",
    "an additional treatment associated with quantum error correction is recommended for this kind of operations .",
    "current research about physical systems on which set up quantum technology , in particular those related with quantum computation , quantum information processing or quantum cryptography , are growing from several directions to get them in a useful form for applications .",
    "nevertheless that optics has been partially a dominant arena to last developments , matter has been shown several own benefits in some involved aspects .",
    "quantum storage and quantum information processing allow new computational tasks which are impossible with conventional information technology or quantum optics exclusively .",
    "in these trends , systems based on trapped ions , e - helium , nuclear magnetic resonance , superconductors , doped silicon and quantum dots have shown opportunities to make stable and efficient developments for that purpose @xcite .",
    "such quantum stuff requires a system of several qubits .",
    "the main materials based technology known for that is magnetic . for this reason , spin - based quantum computing has been developed in several experimental implementations , which uses magnetic systems mainly : superconducting integrated systems , superconducting flux qubits , straight nuclear magnetic resonance and quantum dots .",
    "all of them exploits ising interactions with different approaches @xcite , together with control on quantum states and in particular with entanglement control , a milestone in all almost these researches .",
    "circuit - gate model was the first approach to quantum computation , nevertheless , quantum annealing @xcite or measurement - based quantum computation @xcite are alternatives which use magnetic systems approached by ising interactions to manage a planned and controlled quantum state manipulation . on them , several applied problems has been exhibited as the goal of these technologies ( pattern matching , folding proteins , an other particular np - complete problems @xcite ) in order to test them .    in spite of current work , for magnetic systems and under the regular perspective of interaction when",
    "is depicted on entangled pairs basis , the direct change of classical computational basis on an entangled basis as their basic computer grammar should be considered , inclusively with actual control problems around decoherence entanglement .",
    "thus , another extension is clearly an analogous analysis for multiqubit systems in terms of an adequate basis of entangled states ( as @xmath309 , @xmath310 and other entangled states in @xmath311 or still greater systems ) as in the model presented here . in this work ,",
    "solutions ( [ solh2jm]-[solh2 ] ) set a concrete theoretical method to generate gates with real entries based on ising pulses for two qubits computation .",
    "more generally , procedure ( [ eqstunning1]-[teqs ] ) states a numerical method to solve same problem for complex entries gates in general .",
    "as is stated in @xcite , an important extension of results presented there for multiqubit interactions , it is obtain their evolution in terms of sectors relating their natural states .",
    "last will let extensions of factorization stated in @xcite in terms of ising interaction pulses as was implemented in this work , being extended for a higher number of qubits when they need be processed simultaneously .    in the same way ,",
    "error correction analysis is necessary in our procedures , based on error factors in control ( magnetic field and time measurement , precise knowledge about interaction strengths , etc . ) . in this line of research , the analysis of behavior with finite temperature based on matrix density is mandatory to consider decoherence effects . finally , it is required improvement through alternative continuous pulses to generate the same effects and factorization procedures as those presented here . nevertheless that magnetic rectangular pulses are easy to manage theoretically and still experimentally too because currently there are a tight control on them ( reducing their resonant effects because their discontinuity ) , the best is seek continuous fields ( @xcite has proposed @xmath312 ) to try a reproduction of this kind of effects in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . this method ,",
    "if works , could suppose to apply directed waves on the matter in order to generate in it certain quantum operations based on factorization .    nuclear magnetic resonance , quantum dots and electrons in silicon lattices",
    "are named as the most successful systems in implementing quantum algorithms based on their coherence and stability .",
    "experimental applications to set up current proposal on these technologies should develop a narrow orbit control and strength interactions control .",
