    "classes of objects known to produce significant quantities of dust include asymptotic giant - branch stars , red giants , novae , supernovae ( each of which contributes about equal rates , @xmath5 , of dust in the whole galaxy ) , along with planetary nebulae and proto - stars ( each of which yields @xmath410 times less ; dwek 1985 ) .",
    "surprisingly , some hot , massive , population i wr stars also form dust @xcite .",
    "wr stars are the evolved descendants of massive o - type stars .",
    "they consist mainly of he - burning cores surrounded by hot envelopes that drive fast , dense winds with average mass - loss rates @xmath6 and terminal velocities @xmath7 .",
    "there are three successive wr phases , wn , wc and wo , characterized by the dominant emission lines of n , c , and o , respectively , in their optical spectra .",
    "all dust - making wr stars belong to the carbon - rich , hydrogen - poor wc subclass @xcite .",
    "the wr dust - makers are remarkable for two main reasons : ( 1 ) the absolute rate of formation is very high , up to @xmath8 in dust alone , and occurring in either a periodic ( due to enhanced wind - wind compression at or near periastron passage in long - period wc + o binaries with eccentirc orbits ) or sustained fashion ( in single late - type wc stars or moderately short - period wc + o binaries with circular orbits ) ; and ( 2 ) the dust is formed in a hot , extremely hostile environment , where the formation process is still unknown .    here",
    "we report on near and mid - infrared imaging observations of the dust envelope surrounding the star wr 112 ( spectral class wc9 ) .",
    "the morphology of this envelope provides clues to the nature of the stellar system , while the photometry allows us to estimate the properties of the dust and the total dust mass .",
    "wr112 belongs to the group of 5 wc stars with the densest known dust envelopes @xcite .",
    "we observed wr112 along with wr104 and wr118 with the university of florida mid - ir imager `` oscir '' at the gemini - north 8 m telescope using the medium - band 7.9@xmath9 , 12.5@xmath9 and 18.2@xmath9 filters on 7 may , 2001 .",
    "for wr112 we supplemented the mid - ir data with near - ir narrow - band @xmath10 and @xmath11 images taken at the cfht on 27 june 1999 with the adaptive optics bonnette and kir camera , and broad - band l@xmath12 images obtained at the irtf on 28 may 2000 in the ` movie burst ' ( @xmath13 0.01-sec exposures ) mode of the nsfcam imager .",
    "we also acquired images of point sources ( psf reference stars ) , usually immediately before and after the principal target , for image restoration .",
    "the original data cubes were split into individual frames , quickly checked and selected for image quality using basic image statistics for the oscir and cfht data ( initially compensated for atmospheric turbulence ) , or carefully selected using a specifically designed statistical procedure for the nsfcam images ( taken without compensation ) .",
    "the individual images were then appropriately shifted to form a final image for each wavelength / target / instrument .",
    "the final images were then restored using the images of the psf reference stars and a maximum entropy algorithm ( the ` stsdas.analysis.restore.mem ' task of iraf for the cfht data , enabling us to reach pixel ( @xmath14 ) resolution , or the ` stsdas.analysis.restore.lucy ' task of iraf for the oscir and nsfcam images , thus reaching 1-pixel resolution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "while wr104 and wr118 show only modest extensions on scales of several 0.1@xmath17 , combination of the original mid - ir images of wr112 reveals three sets of regularly spaced arc - like structures extending out @xmath18 from the central star ( fig .",
    "it is apparent that the dust temperature gradually falls off outwards .",
    "the central source and two closest arcs form a w - like configuration , the middle part of which is also seen in the near - ir ( fig .",
    "the near - ir size of the central source , fwhm=@xmath19 , is consistent with earlier measurements @xcite : fwhm=@xmath20 .",
    "the near - ir sw elongation probably corresponds to the previously detected @xcite small - scale asymmetry in the dust envelope .",
    "wr112 is the fourth case in which dust around a wr star has been mapped in some detail , with all the previous examples occurring in wc+o binaries @xcite .",
    "note that 6 other wr stars have been shown to posess an extended ( presumably spherically - symmetric ) envelope @xcite .",
    "wr112 is also known to be a variable non - thermal radio emission source @xcite , which might indicate binarity @xcite .",
    "there are few viable scenarios for dust production in wr112 .",
    "for example , the primordial circumstellar envelope would not have survived in the hard uv radiation - field of the wr progenitor .",
    "periodic outbursts driven by stellar oscillations can not explain the observed dust envelope - shape without invoking a factor of two azimuthal variation in the terminal - wind velocity along with an extreme latitudinal dependence of the mass - loss .",
    "therefore , we assume that the dust is formed in the wind - wind collision zone of a massive binary system ( thus resembling a collimated but rotating ` beam ' for a distant observer ) and expelled radially outward at a constant , terminal - wind velocity @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the resulting locus of maximum dust density and fit it to the observed dust distribution in the restored mid - ir images , taking the necessary orbital elements , @xmath22 as free parameters .",
    "we find a family of minimum-@xmath23 solutions for counter - clockwise orbits , in which coupling of @xmath24-@xmath25 and @xmath26-@xmath27 leads to some degree of degeneracy . instead of relying solely on the single formal best fit ,",
    "we therefore construct a synthetic solution by averaging all the possible combinations of solutions for which the @xmath23 values lie within 5% of the absolute minimum .",
    "this average solution has period @xmath28 , eccentricity @xmath29 , orbital inclination @xmath30 , periastron angle @xmath31 and orbital orientation @xmath32 ( 1-@xmath33 errors ) . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the solution with the highest possible , but still plausible , eccentricity : @xmath34 .",
    "this particular model yields a dust locus that is actually very close to that derived from the synthetic solution .",
    "in general , the model provides fairly good fits to the sw arms , although it fails to explain the pronounced ne excursions , as well as the bright sw protuberance .",
    "the latter extends in the direction toward a stellar visual companion @xmath35 from wr112 ( wallace , moffat & shara 2002 , and our fig.2 ) , which is not seen at near - ir , and is therefore probably also invisible at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "clearly the dust - production rate depends on orbital phase , diminishing as expected around apastron but surprisingly also absent around periastron , contrary to the situation in the eccentric , long - period colliding - wind wr+o binaries wr137 and wr140 @xcite .",
    "the average thickness , @xmath36 , of the dust arcs in the deconvolved images relative to the separation between the successive arcs , @xmath37 ( measured at the same orbital phase ) , gives an estimate of the shock - cone opening angle : @xmath38 , similar to that found in other colliding - wind wr+o systems @xcite . in table 1",
    "we list the calculated orbital elements along with the main characteristics of the dust envelope and the assumed parameters .",
    "to derive the basic dust properties , which fortunately do not depend sensitively on the adopted orbital parameters , we first deproject all apparent distances by applying the synthetic average orbit - solution .",
    "we calibrate the restored images using all available ir - flux measurements of wr112 @xcite , assuming that the system has not experienced any large - amplitude ir outbursts . in the mid - ir range",
    ", the relatively large apertures used in previous ground- and space - based observations will tend to smooth out the variability by averaging over the output of many dust - formation cycles .",
    "we deredden the near - ir data by applying a galactic interstellar - extinction model @xcite , then calculate the net dust fluxes after subtracting the stellar component , approximated as @xmath39 , with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "then we use the relation @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dust mass , @xmath43 is the measured flux at a given position @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the grain density , @xmath46=4.15 kpc is the distance to wr112 @xcite , @xmath47 is the grain size , @xmath48 is the black - body emissivity , and @xmath49 is the grain emission coefficient .",
    "we adopt the general relation @xmath50 along with a @xmath51 temperature profile @xcite and measure the fluxes @xmath43 over regions of fixed @xmath52 pixel size ( @xmath53 ) , assigning 15% /30% errors to @xmath54 in the inner / outer - most arcs . taking the ratios of fluxes at every given position in the envelope ( except the very central part , where the spectral distribution can not be represented by a single temperature ) in order to reduce the number of free parameters and to be impervious to large positional fluctuations in @xmath43 , we obtain via @xmath55-minimization the following estimates : @xmath56 , @xmath57 k , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 at @xmath60 ; 95% confidence intervals ) .",
    "the dust emissivity index @xmath61 , though loosely constrained , is close to the range expected for amorphous carbon in the near - mid - ir domain @xcite . on the other hand , the absence of the telltale 9.7@xmath9 silicate emission feature in the wr112 spectrum @xcite rules out the presence of any silicate - based mixture .",
    "the derived temperature profile follows the @xmath62 dependence expected in the case of thermal equilibrium . adopting @xmath63 for the amorphous carbon dust",
    ", we estimate the dust mass separately for each @xmath52 pixel@xmath64 area of each of the 3 mid - ir images , then average the results ( fig .",
    "we find a total @xmath65 , integrated over the observed envelope . to compare our result with an earlier theoretical estimate of the mass we ( a ) account for the difference in the adopted distances to wr112 and ( b ) assume that the observed dust is created for 15 yrs ( see fig .",
    "2 ) during each 25-yr orbital cycle , with 3 complete cycles accounted for . a model @xcite with the assumption of a spherically - symmetric envelope gives @xmath66 ( converted to d=4.15 kpc ) , while our estimate is @xmath67 .",
    "calculation of the _ integrated _ mass - ratios , m(innermost region+arcs ) : m(middle arcs ) : m(outer - most arcs)=1.0 : 0.6 : 0.2 , shows that the dust is gradually destroyed while leaving the system .",
    "both the intense uv radiation field and sputtering caused by the high drift - velocities of the dust grains @xcite may be responsible for the dust destruction . nevertheless , the flattening of the trend at large radii in fig",
    "3 suggests that some dust does reach the ism .",
    "finally , we use eq . 1 to evaluate the characteristic size of the dust grains , by comparing via least - square minimization , the observed fluxes to the prediction of a simple model assuming that the envelope is populated by similar - sized spherical particles .",
    "we calculate the mie absorption coefficients @xcite , @xmath68 , using the optical constants for amorphous carbon @xcite . as a second free parameter we take the integrated ( innermost region+arcs ) dust mass , allowing it to follow the general trend seen in fig .",
    "3 . this gives an estimate of @xmath42 within 25% of the previously calculated value , thus providing a good consistency check .",
    "we find a characteristic grain - size @xmath69 ( 95% confidence interval ) , in line with the estimates obtained for wr112 from iso spectroscopy , @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the large grain size poses a serious problem for the theory of grain growth , which calls for @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the recently acquired high - resolution , high signal - to - noise near - mid - ir images of the wr star wr112 have enabled us to resolve and , for the first time , study in detail the extended dust envelope thought to be formed in the wind - wind collision zone of the long - period , @xmath72 , binary . a simple approach involving a minimum of assumptions has allowed us to derive the basic dust properties : we find that the dust emissivity approximately follows the trend expected for amorphous carbon .",
    "the radial temperature - distribution shows the dust envelope to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the dust production - rate corresponds to @xmath73 of the total mass - loss rate , if for the latter we assume a typical value of @xmath74 .",
    "the characteristic size of the dust particles , @xmath75 , turns out to be much larger than expected from state - of - the - art models of dust growth .",
    "we also show that , despite the harsh conditions , @xmath76 of the newly formed dust can survive and escape the system , thus enriching the interstellar medium .",
    "this may have a direct implication for the process of heavy - element enrichment in the early universe , when massive stars completely dominated the stellar scene .",
