    "in many experiments with radioactive atoms , elements are produced as ions and then neutralized .",
    "the most important requirement for a neutralization system is the fast release of neutral atoms , with respect to their radioactive decay time . in particular , in our francium experiment at infn s national laboratories in legnaro , italy @xcite , we produce fr ions that have to be neutralized before accumulation in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "the system must be very efficient , as a large sample of fr atoms is requested for nuclear decay , atomic parity violation and permanent electric dipole studies .",
    "our apparatus follows the scheme of the stony brook experiment @xcite , where many measurements on fr have been performed so far .",
    "francium isotopes are produced at the tandem accelerator facility in legnaro via the fusion - evaporation reaction @xmath3 with an energy of the primary beam around 100  mev , we are able to produce fr isotopes in the mass number range 208 - 211 .",
    "these isotopes have a lifetime that is long enough for laser cooling and trapping .",
    "the system is at the moment optimized for maximum production of @xmath4fr , which has a half - life of 191  s. francium atoms are ionized at the surface of the gold target and transported through an electrostatic beamline at an energy of 3  kev towards a spectroscopic cell designed for laser cooling .",
    "the ionic beam is focused on a 99.96% pure yttrium foil , placed inside the cell on the opposite side with respect to the entrance aperture . in order to be able to detect the trap",
    ", we have to optimize all the processes , from production to laser trapping . with only a few days of beamtime per year , it is not convenient to test the setup with francium : we decided to use stable rubidium , always available in high quantities . to this purpose",
    "a rb dispenser was placed in the reaction chamber near the target : rb atoms that arrive on the gold surface are ionized and injected in the electrostatic line , following the same path as fr .",
    "a sketch of the apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : expsetup ] .",
    "yttrium has a work function @xmath5  ev , that is lower than fr and rb ionization potentials , respectively @xmath6  ev and @xmath7  ev .",
    "the probability of release in neutral form at the y surface is close to unity , according to the saha - langmuir equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the number of desorbed ions and neutral atoms , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the statistical weights due to degeneracy of the ion and atom ground states respectively ( @xmath13 for alkalis ) , and @xmath14 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "this ratio is @xmath15 at 1000  k.    in spite of the fact that high temperature enhances diffusion , we fixed an upper limit of 1050  k in order to preserve the cell coating @xcite and hence not to compromise the trapping efficiency .",
    "this is a limitation because melting point of y is @xmath16=1799  k , and because the total release fraction grows with the ratio @xmath17 @xcite . in this context ,",
    "our goal was to check whether the efficiency of the neutralizer was high enough at a chosen temperature .",
    "so far the release efficiency of radioactive atoms embedded in the neutralizer has been measured by monitoring their nuclear decay @xcite .",
    "we used atomic laser spectroscopy to observe the time evolution of the released neutrals and deduce the diffusion time .",
    "we also took advantage of the extraordinary sensitivity given by our magneto - optical trap , which allows us to observe as few as 50 atoms .",
    "if an ion is implanted at a given depth inside the y foil , then it has to diffuse towards the surface to be released in atomic form . in order to achieve a good release efficiency , the time necessary to complete this process has to be small compared with the radioactive lifetime of the investigated atom .",
    "since the transverse dimension of the ionic beam is much larger than the penetration depth , we can use the one - dimensional diffusion equation for the concentration @xmath18 of the diffusing species in the y foil at the distance @xmath19 from the surface : @xmath20 @xmath21 is the radioactive decay rate ( @xmath22 for rb ) , @xmath23 the diffusion coefficient and @xmath24 is the incoming current of ions impinging on the y foil . note that",
    "@xmath24 is not directly observable : it has to be deduced from the measurement of its integral @xmath25 ( the total current ) on the neutralizer volume and from the presumed implantation distribution , discussed in sections [ sz : pulse ] and [ sz : cont ] .",
    "empirically , we expect that the dependence of @xmath23 on the temperature follows the arrhenius law @xmath26 @xmath27 is the activation energy and @xmath28 is the theoretical asymptotic value of @xmath23 for large temperatures . the characteristic diffusion time is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean implantation depth of ions in the y foil .      in the case of @xmath31 ions all",
    "implanted at the same distance @xmath30 from the surface at the time @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 , the diffusion equation with @xmath34 has an analytical solution : the flux of neutral atoms released in the cell at the time @xmath35 is given by  @xcite @xmath36 for an implantation distribution with a finite extent , the function can be different , specially for @xmath37 ; in a rough approximation , this difference can be taken into account with a correction factor , which is expected to be of the order of unity in the case that @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "for instance , melconian  _ et al .",
    "_ take the case of a distribution modelled by a gaussian times a linear term , with a characteristic implantation depth @xmath30  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the function becomes @xmath39      if a constant total ionic current @xmath40 is sent to the neutralizer starting at the time @xmath32 , for stable isotopes ( @xmath22 ) we see that the neutralized released current takes the form @xmath41 .",

    "_ , we have @xmath42 .\\ ] ]    we will see in the following that we can operate in two modes .",
    "if we let ions accumulate in cold yttrium for a certain time and then we turn on the neutralizer ( pulsed mode ) , all the implanted ions are released according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fl0 ] ) or ( [ melc ] ) . instead , if we turn on the ionic beam with the neutralizer already working ( continuous mode ) , we are in the case described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flcw ] ) or ( [ melc2 ] ) .    in our model of the release process",
    ", we neglect the contribution of desorption to the release time .",
    "we can reasonably assume that , due also to the accuracy of such a model , discussed in section [ sz : contpuls ] , desorption contribution is well included in our uncertainty .",
    "in any case , as also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the diffusion coefficients derived from our data analysis can be properly considered as upper limits .",
    "after being released , atoms can be either directly detected in the vapor phase ( rubidium ) , or they can be first collected in a small volume ( about 1  mm@xmath43 ) in order to enhance our sensitivity ( rubidium and francium ) .",
    "the confinement is provided by a magneto - optical trap in the standard configuration : six trapping and repumping laser beams respectively tuned on the d2 and d1 lines , and a constant gradient magnetic field provided by two anti - helmholtz coils .",
    "the total number of atoms in the cell , when the six laser beams and the magnetic field are present , is the sum of two components : the number of trapped atoms @xmath44 and the number of atoms in the vapor phase @xmath45 which is supposed to be at thermal equilibrium with the cell walls .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is well described by the coupled rate equations @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rate related to the loading process ( the product @xmath48 represents the number of atoms per unit time loaded from the vapor to the mot ) , @xmath49 is the rate describing the collisional loss of atoms from the mot ( @xmath50 represents the number of trapped atoms per unit time which go back from trap to vapor phase due to collisions with background gas in the cell ) and @xmath51 is the rate characterizing the loss of atoms from the vapor phase ( @xmath52 represents the number of atoms per unit time definitively lost to the vacuum system or by chemisorption to the cell walls ) .",
    "@xmath53 is the current of atoms released by the neutralizer and suitable for trapping .",
    "we did not report the quadratic terms due to collisions between trapped atoms , which are negligible .",
    "we can find the quasi - stationary state solution @xmath54 of eqs.([eq : rate ] ) under the condition @xmath55 ( slowly varying incoming current hypothesis ) : @xmath56 in practice , provided that @xmath53 varies with a time scale much longer than @xmath57 , we obtain that the detected number of trapped atoms and the total number of atoms in the vapor phase are proportional to the released current at any time .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the trap signal or of the fluorescence signal directly gives all the information about diffusion inside the neutralizer .",
    "this constitutes an innovative way of measuring the diffusion coefficient , with respect to other experiments that measure the release efficiency by detecting the radioactivity from the residual ions in the neutralizer .",
    "at room temperature the rb vapor density is high enough to be directly detected through resonant excitation and looking at the atomic fluorescence . in order to minimize changes in the apparatus we made measurements by only switching off the trapping magnetic field , but keeping in place the six laser beams .",
    "the laser frequency is scanned across the whole profile of the d2 rb line to search for the maximum signal .",
    "fluorescence light is in this case collected on a si photodiode .",
    "we tried different spectroscopic schemes and we obtained the best signal - to - noise ratio with the one described above . in the case of francium ,",
    "it is not possible to directly observe the atomic vapor fluorescence , because the signals are extremely weak .",
    "the solution is given by the mot , that allows to accumulate fr ( and also rb ) atoms in a small volume at low temperature .",
    "in fact the signal increases by about two orders of magnitude because of doppler broadening elimination and , at low densities , far from saturated vapor pressures , by several orders of magnitude because of higher densities . as already stressed , we are able to detect traps of only a few tens of atoms .",
    "atomic fluorescence from trapped atoms is detected by a ccd cooled camera ( fig .",
    "[ fg : expsetup ] ) .",
    "a dedicated software performs background subtraction , to reduce the contribution of scattered light to the noise , and real time correction for laser intensity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the detector was accurately calibrated and the software directly gives the number of atoms in the cold cloud .",
    "when we turn on the ionic beam and send it on a hot neutralizer set at a constant temperature , we expect the spectroscopic signals to be well described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flcw ] ) and ( [ melc2 ] ) ( fig .  [ contrb ] ) .",

    "( with an additional offset ) was fitted to the experimental data . ]    in order to enhance the signals , it is possible to operate in a pulsed mode .",
    "we let the ions accumulate in cold yttrium : at room temperature , the diffusion coefficient is very small , and the ions stay embedded in the neutralizer .",
    "when the neutralizer is turned on , the atoms are released all together in a time scale of the order of @xmath58 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fl0 ] ) or ( [ melc ] ) . in practice , for both rb and fr we usually kept the ionic current on for 600 s ( which corresponds to more than three @xmath4fr radioactive half - lives ) .",
    "this method gave excellent results to estimate the neutralizer release efficiency , and to determine the best operating temperature for our neutralizer .",
    "most measurements have been done in the pulsed mode , because of the higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we obtained a set of data for each neutralizer operating temperature : the main goal was to optimize the yttrium temperature in order to obtain a good release efficiency .    the function @xmath59",
    ", corresponding to the flux @xmath60 ( eq .  ( [ melc ] ) ) , was fitted to each acquired data set , with the free parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fg : tempineutr1 ] ) .",
    "the offset @xmath61 is due to the presence of rb impurities in yttrium : even with fresh neutralizers , never exposed to rb current , we detect rb vapor in the cell coming from the heated yttrium foil .",
    "note that @xmath64 is not left as a free parameter , because it is totally correlated with the other parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 : for any value @xmath65 , we can find the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 , such that @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 is manually set to the time at which the signal begins rising , just after turning on the neutralizer .",
    "since the neutralizer does not reach the operating temperature instantaneously , @xmath64 is affected by an error corresponding to the signal rising time .",
    "the initial part of the curve critically depends on the way the neutralizer is turned on , and on the initial distribution of ions inside yttrium ( cf .",

    "release time data are consistent with arrhenius law for the diffusion coefficient @xmath23 .",

    "the choice of such a fit function lies in the fact that @xmath71 better describes the diffusion time in the temperature range of our measurements , while @xmath72 would be affected by a larger error , due to the extrapolation to infinite temperature .",
    "results of fit are @xmath73  s and @xmath74  ev .",
    "we used the trim code @xcite to evaluate the mean implantation depth for rb in y at 3  kev , which gives a value of 4.9  nm . from this data",
    "we can then deduce the diffusion coefficient at 1000  k : @xmath75 we also performed measurements on rb using the mot detection method , to prepare the fr measurements and to test our diffusion model also for the mot signal evlution .",
    "experimental data and fit curve for rb mot in pulsed regime are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fg : motrb ] ) .",
    "a good agreement was found between data and model , and also with the results obtained from vapor fluorescence detection described above . the fit procedure used in this case",
    "is discussed in section  [ sz : frmeas ] .",
    "the diffusion time of francium in yttrium has been measured using the magneto - optical trap .",
    "we operate in the pulsed mode in order to get higher signals : we use the same method as for rb , with detection of trapped atoms . with a collisional rate @xmath49 of about 0.5  s@xmath76",
    ", we checked that the condition @xmath77 is verified for all the acquired data .",
    "as compared to vapor fluorescence data , mot fluorescence is quite difficult to analyze in the pulsed mode , to deduce the diffusion time .",
    "when we turn on the neutralizer , francium atoms come out of yttrium along with many other impurities already contained in the neutralizer ( as rb ) : vacuum suddenly deteriorates , and then slowly comes back to the equilibrium value . since the coefficient @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ststsol ] ) strongly depends on vacuum quality , in the first part of the curve ( @xmath78 ) @xmath49 depends on time and it is not easy to interpret the data .",
    "however , retaining only data with @xmath79 can not be a solution , because in this regime @xmath62 and @xmath63 are totally correlated ( it is not possible to distinguish them in the fitting procedure ) .",
    "our compromise was to consider data after a time @xmath69 that corresponds to a signal which is equal to half the maximum signal of the whole curve ( fig .",
    "[ fg : trapfit ] ) . for these data vacuum effects",
    "are satisfactorily reduced and the order of magnitude is reasonable .",
    "it was not always easy to reach convergence in fits : in practice , we kept @xmath62 and @xmath63 as free parameters , and we set the offset and @xmath64 to a reasonable value for each fit . in some cases ,",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath62 were too correlated to obtain a good convergence : we had to repeat the fitting procedure with @xmath62 set by hand to realistic values .",
    "the error for the obtained parameters includes several contributions : statistical error from the fit and uncertainties of @xmath61 and @xmath64 .",
    "we saw in section  [ sz : rbmeas ] that the methodology was checked with rb atoms .",
    "the agreement between mot and vapor data demonstrates the validity of our measurements and of the fitting procedure .",
    "we expect to be able to improve our results .",
    "because the presented measurements were initially intended to test the final release efficiency , in terms of number of atoms @xmath31 rather than release time @xmath63 , we preferred to begin with the pulsed method , which gives higher signals and higher signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "nevertheless , in our limited beam - time we managed to acquire data in the continuous regime for one neutralizer temperature : we remind that in this regime we expect no vacuum - related problems .",

    "we performed release time measurements using also the @xmath82 decay rate signal , and we obtained similar results , at least as order of magnitude , thus confirming the consistency of our method .",
    "fit results according to eq.([eq : taud ] ) are : @xmath83    an activation energy of @xmath84  ev was measured for @xmath85k in yttrium in ref .",
    "@xcite , so our results for both fr and rb are consistent with literature .",

    "@xcite it is possible to define a parameter @xmath87 , which takes into account the loss of atoms due to nuclear decay during the diffusion towards surface .",
    "this is the so - called `` release fraction '' which gives the percentage of radioactive ions neutralized before the decay and then suitable for trapping .",

    ", we did not perform systematic measurements on @xmath89fr .",
    "nevertheless , our prediction of @xmath90 provides an estimation of the optimal conditions for the @xmath89fr neutralization : due to shorter lifetime of about 72  s , we expect @xmath89fr neutralization to be more efficient at higher temperatures with respect to @xmath4fr  ( fig .",
