    "the kuramoto model  @xcite of coupled oscillators has been used to shed light on many diverse systems of physical interest , particularly those involving synchronization transitions .",
    "examples include josephson junction arrays  @xcite , charge - density waves  @xcite , laser arrays  @xcite , collective atomic recoil lasers  @xcite , bubbly fluids  @xcite , neutrino flavor oscillations  @xcite , electrochemical oscillators  @xcite , and human crowd behavior  @xcite .",
    "originally , however , the kuramoto model had no known physical applications ; these were only discovered years later .",
    "kuramoto was led to his model solely by considerations of mathematical tractability .",
    "he was seeking an exactly solvable many - oscillator system displaying a phase transition to mutual synchronization , in hopes of illuminating this novel critical phenomenon seen earlier by winfree in his simulations of biological rhythms  @xcite .",
    "in that same spirit , we have begun investigating a family of simple models that generalize the kuramoto model in one key respect : they include _ both _ positive and negative coupling in the same system .",
    "positive coupling , analogous to a ferromagnetic interaction , tends to align the oscillators in phase .",
    "negative coupling , analogous to an antiferromagnetic interaction , drives oscillators apart and favors a phase difference of @xmath0 . when both types of coupling are present , the system becomes frustrated . in this case",
    "very little is known about what sorts of dynamics and equilibrium states might follow .",
    "even the mean - field version of such systems remains mysterious .",
    "twenty years ago , in pioneering work , daido found evidence that kuramoto models with mixed positive and negative coupling could undergo a glass transition  @xcite , but the existence and properties of such an `` oscillator glass '' remain unclear  @xcite .",
    "other models with mixed attractive / repulsive interactions have since been explored by several authors , who were also motivated by analogies to spin glasses , as well as to neural networks with mixed excitatory and inhibitory connections  @xcite . in each instance",
    "it has been difficult to understand the behavior of these models because of their inherent nonlinearity , quenched random interactions , and large numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "inspired by kuramoto s success in explaining winfree s synchronization transition through the use of a toy model , we wondered whether daido s oscillator glass transition might be similarly rationalized by studying much simpler models with mixed coupling . in this paper",
    "we analyze the behavior of one such model and find , unfortunately , that this particular simplification does not exhibit an oscillator glass .",
    "nevertheless , this negative result still provides valuable information .",
    "it shows that certain types of frustration are insufficient to produce an oscillator glass , and thereby constrains the possible mechanisms at work .",
    "furthermore , the model does display some interesting new dynamical phenomena , as we discuss below .",
    "and although we are unaware of any physical realization of the model studied here , we suspect that such realizations may exist , given the model s simplicity , and given the history of the kuramoto model itself , whose physical relevance was established only after the model had been proposed on theoretical grounds .",
    "the governing equations for the model are @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the phase of the @xmath3th oscillator in the @xmath4-subpopulation , @xmath5 is its natural frequency , and @xmath6 is the total number of oscillators .",
    "the oscillators in subpopulation 1 are assumed to have positive coupling ( @xmath7 ) to all the other oscillators in the system , whereas those in subpopulation 2 have negative coupling @xmath8 .",
    "equation  ( [ model ] ) differs from the classic kuramoto model in that the distributed natural frequencies @xmath9 have been replaced by a uniform natural frequency @xmath5 , and the single positive coupling constant @xmath10 has been replaced by a two - valued coupling constant @xmath11 . in an earlier paper , we considered the case in which @xmath9 was kept heterogeneous  @xcite . as we will see here however ,",
    "the long - time dynamics is actually more complicated for the homogeneous case .",
    "this finding is consistent with previous studies of identical oscillators ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for example ) .",
    "what is unusual about this model is that its pairwise interactions need not be symmetric . for example , oscillator @xmath12 could be coupled positively to oscillator @xmath3 while @xmath3 is coupled negatively to @xmath12 in return .",
    "this leads to a novel type of frustration .",
    "although unfamiliar , it may be physically realizable in certain kinds of series arrays of josephson junctions  @xcite or in liquid crystal spatial light modulators suitably coupled by global optoelectronic feedback  @xcite . because of its asymmetry , this form of coupling is non - variational ; no energy function exists , and the dynamics do not correspond to relaxation or gradient descent down an energy landscape . while this might seem unnatural in some physical settings ( e.g. , magnetic spin systems ) , it is more plausible in certain social or political contexts . in particular , if we set @xmath13 ( as can be done without loss of generality by going into a suitable rotating frame , or equivalently , by replacing @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the model starts to resemble some of the existing models of social opinion formation  @xcite .    to see the connection ,",
    "imagine a spectrum of opinions or attitudes that can be laid out as points on a circle , rather than as points on a line .",
    "for instance , binmore  @xcite has argued that political attitudes are more properly represented this way than as the usual linear continuum from left wing to right wing . now consider a population of indifferent individuals who have no preferred phase along the circle , or , to continue the analogy , no inherent political preference .",
    "all that matters to them is what other people think .",
    "such an individual updates his or her political  phase \" continuously , based on where he or she stands in relation to the prevailing sentiment .",
    "some individuals  the conformists  want to be in phase with conventional wisdom , whatever it happens to be , whereas contrarians reflexively oppose it .",
    "the question is : depending on the relative proportions of conformists and contrarians , and depending on how intensely they react to the prevailing opinion , what will this population do in the long run",
    "? split into two camps ?",
    "fail to reach any consensus at all ? or cycle through all attitudes periodically ? as we ll see ,",
    "all of these are possible long - term outcomes , depending on the choice of model parameters .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the fraction of oscillators with positive coupling ; thus the system consists of @xmath17 conformists and @xmath18 contrarians , where @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] ) .",
    "when @xmath20 , all the oscillators repel one another , a case explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will examine the dynamics of this system as its parameters are varied .",
    "we will continue to use the metaphorical language of conformists and contrarians , although perhaps we should stress that we do not intend the model to be taken literally as a description of real social situations .",
    "it is a toy model . like the kuramoto model itself",
    ", it is being offered on theoretical grounds , without any particular physical realization in mind .",
    "the goal is to clarify the dynamical consequences of mixed coupling , by investigating a particularly simple and tractable special case .",
    "our hope is that such an investigation may bring us a step closer toward solving the puzzle of  oscillator glass \"  @xcite .     a schematic plot of a set of eight identical oscillators with positive and negative coupling .",
    "open circles represent oscillators with negative coupling to all the others ; filled circles denote oscillators with positive coupling .",
    "when @xmath21 , all oscillators are contrarians . however , as @xmath16 is increased , conformists begin to appear and eventually replace all contrarians as @xmath16 approaches @xmath22 . ]",
    "the dynamical system given by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) enjoys a highly non - generic structure .",
    "it has @xmath23 constants of motion , for all @xmath24 . in geometrical terms",
    ", its phase space is foliated by an @xmath25-parameter family of six - dimensional invariant manifolds .",
    "these results can be seen explicitly by using a theoretical device discovered by watanabe and strogatz  @xcite , and recently generalized by pikovsky and rosenblum  @xcite .",

    "( [ fgs ] ) can be expressed as @xmath31       = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\gamma_s(t)}{1 - \\gamma_s(t ) } }       \\tan\\left[\\frac{\\psi^{(s)}_j - \\psi_{s}(t)}{2}\\right ] ,      \\label{wstf}\\ ] ] where the @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ wstf ] ) are _ constant _ , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 evolve according to the ordinary differential equations @xmath36 here again the variables @xmath37 denote the oscillator phases in the @xmath4-subpopulation , where @xmath38 .",
    "the constants @xmath32 represent a set of fixed phases on which the transformation operates .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath39 , then the @xmath40 are just the initial phases @xmath41 . since the variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the same for all @xmath3 within each subpopulation , the flow governed by eq .",
    "( [ wseq ] ) is effectively 6-dimensional , as claimed .",
    "it describes the dynamics restricted to the invariant manifold labelled by the choice of the constants @xmath32 , of which @xmath23 turn out to be independent  @xcite .",
    "a further reduction is possible in the continuum limit @xmath42 , in the special case where the phases @xmath40 are uniformly distributed around the circle .",
    "then the transformation eq .",
    "( [ wstf ] ) maps old phases @xmath40 to new phases @xmath14 such that for each subpopulation , a uniform distribution of the @xmath40 maps onto a poisson kernel distribution of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the set of states in which each subpopulation is distributed like a poisson kernel is dynamically invariant  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more about this ) . from here on , we will refer to this distinguished invariant manifold as the _ poisson submanifold_.    incidentally , these considerations underlie the ( otherwise seemingly miraculous ) ansatz discovered by ott and antonsen  @xcite .",
    "they found that poisson kernels are also dynamically invariant for the original kuramoto model , where the oscillator frequencies are non - identical .",
    "this beautiful invariance property has its origin in group theory  @xcite and has allowed many new insights to be gained into the dynamics of the kuramoto model and its relatives  @xcite .    on the poisson submanifold , two of the equations in the system  ( [ wseq ] )",
    "decouple from the other four .",
    "thus , as we will see in detail below , the dynamics become effectively four - dimensional there . and",
    "because of an additional rotational symmetry ( stemming from the fact that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) involves only phase differences , not absolute phases ) , the flow can be further reduced to a three - dimensional system , which appears later in this paper as eq .",
    "( [ eq : oa ] ) .",
    "we now numerically explore the dynamics of the six - dimensional system given by eq .",
    "( [ wseq ] ) to get a sense of its equilibrium states . to do so , we recall that @xmath16 is the fraction of the @xmath6 oscillators that are conformists , and we define @xmath43 as the relative intensity of the conformist coupling : @xmath44 .",
    "thus , values of @xmath43 close to 1 mean the conformists are much more intense in their desire to be like everyone else , as compared to the relatively mild obstinacy of the contrarians .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath43 is close to 0 , the conformists are tepid while the contrarians are passionate .    for our initial conditions ,",
    "we choose each @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 uniformly at random from @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we set the @xmath6 constants @xmath40 such that each subpopulation is evenly spaced on the interval @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "for example if the @xmath17 conformists are indexed first and the @xmath18 contrarians after , we set @xmath40 to be @xmath52 as we noted in the previous section , choosing @xmath53 confines the trajectories to a distinguished submanifold of the phase space in which the new phases @xmath14 for each subpopulation are distributed like a poisson kernel .",
    "choosing @xmath54 instead gives an initial condition off this special manifold and therefore allows the system to explore other parts of phase space  @xcite .",
    "we begin by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ wseq ] ) from initial conditions on the poisson submanifold .",
    "after transients have decayed we compute the final phase density @xmath55 and order parameter @xmath56 , defined by @xmath57 we also compute the final order parameters of each subpopulation : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 represents the degree of synchronization of the subpopulation @xmath4 , and @xmath62 denotes its average phase .",
    "likewise , @xmath63 is the number of oscillators in this subpopulation .",
    "the integration itself is done using heun s method with a time step of @xmath64 .",

    "the integration was performed for @xmath65 oscillators and the final states are presented as histograms with a bin size of 0.01 .",
    "conformist oscillators are shown in blue and contrarian oscillators in red .",

    "the system generally seems to end up in one of four states ( fig .",
    "[ fourstates ] ) :    * the _ incoherent state _ , in which both the conformists and contrarians are uniformly distributed around the unit circle in the complex plane , yielding @xmath71 . in terms of the political analogy discussed earlier , this means that no predominant attitude emerges in the population .",

    "the peaks of their phase distributions are blurred and separated from one another by an angle of @xmath0 . here",
    "the political interpretation is that two main factions have emerged , in diametrical opposition to one another .",
    "they could lie anywhere on the political spectrum , but once they emerge , the contrarians oppose the conformist view . and because of the blurred nature of both peaks , `` fringe '' views are also present on either side of the two main attitudes . *",
    "a _ traveling wave state _ , in which the conformists and contrarians exhibit full and partial phase synchrony , respectively , with the peaks of their phase distributions offset by an angle less than @xmath0 .",
    "here the conformists are unified in their views , yet that consensus view keeps changing , periodically cycling through all possible points on the political spectrum .",
    "meanwhile the contrarians oppose them , but not quite diametrically , and their opinions remain dispersed throughout . * the _ @xmath0-state _ , in which the conformists and contrarians are completely synchronized into two antipodal delta functions ( and thus @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "this simple state represents implacable polarization between two unified and unchanging factions .",

    "<S> we consider a variant of the kuramoto model , in which all the oscillators are now assumed to have the same natural frequency , but some of them are _ negatively _ coupled to the mean field . </S>",
    "<S> these  contrarian \" oscillators tend to align in antiphase with the mean field , whereas the positively coupled  conformist \" oscillators favor an in - phase relationship . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between these effects can lead to rich dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a splitting of the population into two diametrically opposed factions , the system can also display traveling waves , complete incoherence , and a blurred version of the two - faction state . </S>",
    "<S> exact solutions for these states and their bifurcations are obtained by means of the watanabe - strogatz transformation and the ott - antonsen ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , this system of oscillators with identical frequencies turns out to exhibit more complicated dynamics than its counterpart with heterogeneous natural frequencies . </S>"
