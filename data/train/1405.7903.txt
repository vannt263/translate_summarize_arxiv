    "transportation problem , revised simplex method , earth mover s distance , emd , wasserstein distance , monge - kantorovich problem",
    "finding solutions to the classical transportation problem is of great importance , since this optimization problem arises in various guises in many real world and theoretical situations . they occur as subproblems in larger problems , e.g. the warehouse location problem or the traveling salesperson problem and also in a variety of engineering and computer science applications , such as content based image retrieval @xcite , automatic scene analysis @xcite or for the discrimination between real and artificial fingerprints @xcite .",
    "a more extensive discussion of such applications is given in section [ secapplications ] .",
    "the problem was first described by monge in 1781 @xcite in somewhat different form and has been analyzed by many researches including kantorovich , hitchcock , koopmans and especially dantzig @xcite , the father of the simplex algorithm .",
    "the solution of this problem is the fundamental ingredient for computing the earth mover s distance @xcite in computer science and the wasserstein distance , also known as mallows or kantorovich distance in statistics and physics , see chapter  6 in @xcite .    in order to give a quick and intuitive description of the various facets of the transportation problem and the revised simplex algorithm we often use an economic interpretation , which of course will not reduce the scope of the described algorithms and their applications in any way .",
    "the problem can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider a consortium of @xmath0 production and @xmath1 consumption facilities of a certain good .",
    "for simplicity these are also referred to as origins and destinations .",
    "suppose that there is a certain supply of @xmath2 available at origin @xmath3 , and there is a certain demand of @xmath4 at destination @xmath5 .",
    "the cost for transporting a unit of the good from @xmath3 to @xmath5 shall be given by arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "borrowing the illustration from chapter  3 in @xcite , the production facilities might be parisian bakeries cooperating with cafs ( consumption facilities ) , where the good transported are baguettes , and the cost incurred is the actual transportation cost .",
    "it is assumed that total supply equals total demand , i.e. @xmath7 . the objective is then to determine a transportation plan @xmath8 such that all producers and consumers are satisfied and that the total cost is minimized . in other words",
    "@xmath9    a dual formulation can be obtained as follows .",
    "suppose that a carrying company offers to take over the good from the consortium for a price of @xmath10 per unit at origin @xmath3 and to hand it back at destination @xmath5 for a price of @xmath11 ( any prices may be negative ) . in order for the carrier to be competitive , it needs to set prices @xmath12 so that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "following @xcite we refer to the difference @xmath16 as _ relative cost _ incurred when the consortium takes over the transportation from @xmath3 to @xmath5 itself rather than commissioning the carrier .",
    "the carrier would like to maximize its profit @xmath17 subject to the price constraint .",
    "standard duality theory , e.g.  chapter  4 in @xcite relates the solutions of the two problems to one another ( provided one of them exists ) and shows that the optimal values of the objective functions are the same .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sectransportationalgorithm ]",
    "we first give a non - technical description of the revised simplex algorithm for solving the transportation problem ; for a more detailed presentation see @xcite .",
    "then we discuss crucial aspects in various subsections , starting with pivot strategies ( subsection  [ ssecpivot ] ) , and passing from cycle finding to treating initialization methods ( subsections  [ sseccycfinding ] and  [ ssecinitmethods ] , respectively ) . in section [ secshortlist ] , we introduce the new shortlist method for solving the transportation problem .",
    "benchmark tests reported in section [ secresults ] clearly show the advantage of the proposed method over the existing ones .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in section [ secconclusions ] and review relevant application scenarios in section [ secapplications ] .",
    "using the simplex approach the transportation algorithm consists of two stages : first , an initial transportation plan @xmath18 is constructed such that equations  ( 24 ) are satisfied .",
    "second , the initial plan is iteratively improved until the optimal solution is obtained .    at any time",
    "the current feasible plan consists of @xmath19 `` active '' origin / destination pairs @xmath20 between which a positive amount @xmath21 is transported ( in a degenerate case there might be pairs with zero amount , but we exclude this case in our description )",
    ". we will refer to them as basis pairs or basis entries .    for each iteration in the second stage a basis entry is replaced by a `` better one '' . for this",
    "we first compute the `` dual '' prices @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the context of the simplex method ,",
    "these are also known as simplex multipliers .",
    "starting with an arbitrary value , e.g.  setting @xmath24 , all other prices are determined by solving the equations @xmath25 , where @xmath20 are basis entries .",
    "a property well - known as basis triangularity sees to it that every origin and every destination gets a price assigned in this way .    a new basis entry is then selected as a so - called pivot element by finding a non - basis pair @xmath20 that has negative relative cost @xmath26 , meaning that the consortium can transport goods more cheaply from @xmath3 to @xmath5 by itself than by commissioning the carrier .    next",
    ", a cycle of changes starting in @xmath20 is determined by alternately scanning rows and columns for basis entries until a cycle is complete , which again is bound to happen by basis triangularity .",
    "assuming that all amounts @xmath27 at basis entries are positive ( the non - degenerate case ) , there is a maximal positive amount @xmath28 which we can alternately add and subtract from the values @xmath27 when following the cycle , starting with addition for the first value @xmath21 .",
    "since the cycle alternates between following rows and columns , the procedure preserves equations ( 23 ) .",
    "after this , one of the @xmath27 has been reduced to @xmath29 and we remove the corresponding pair @xmath30 from the basis ( if several values have been reduced to zero , we remove the first such entry , but are then dealing with a degenerate case ) .",
    "the basis still has exactly @xmath31 entries , and we proceed with the next iteration , continuing until there are no entries with negative relative cost any more . in this case we have reached an optimum .",
    "when selecting a pivot element to enter the basis , all non - basis entries with relative cost @xmath32 are candidates . according to dantzig s criterion ,",
    "the most negative one is chosen . to the best of our knowledge",
    "it is an open question whether a better criterion for selecting one of these candidates can be formulated in order to minimize the number of pivot operations until optimality is reached .",
    "if the algorithm is applied to solve real - world transportation problems , the goal of a practical implementation is typically to minimize the runtime on a computer .",
    "our analysis has shown that _ two _ key factors determine the runtime : the number of pivot operations and the number of elements for which relative costs are computed in order to select pivot elements .",
    "the former can be made small by computing the relative costs for all non - basis entries which in turn maximizes the latter ( ` matrix most negative ' strategy ) .",
    "the other extreme is to perform the pivot operation immediately after discovering the first candidate ( ` first negative ' strategy ) . in this way",
    ", the second factor is minimized at the cost of an increase of the first .",
    "a more balanced strategy is to compute the relative costs for all non - basis entries of a row and then choose the most negative among these candidates ( ` modified row most negative strategy ' ) or go on with the subquent row , if no candidate has been discovered . in the next iteration of the algorithm , continue with the first row not considered in the previous one .",
    "the latter strategy outperformed the others in our tests , which corroborates earlier findings reported by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the procedure of finding cycles of changes can be translated into a depth - first search ( dfs ) @xcite on the following directed graph ( see also figure  [ fig : dfs ] ) : each basis entry corresponds to two vertices : one vertex with the basis entries in the same row as incoming edges and the basis entries in the same column as outgoing edges , and a second vertex with the basis entries in the same column as incoming edges and the basis entries in the same row as outgoing edges . the graph is weakly connected , acyclic and bipartite . by adding the ( two copies of the ) pivot element , the graph becomes cyclic and dfs is an efficient method for discovering the ( up to mirroring ) unique cycle .",
    "since each basis entry is connected to all other basis entries in the same row and the same column , no other data structure is needed to store the graph than a list of basis entries for each row and for each column .",
    "considering the example shown in figure  [ fig : dfs ] , we begin with the transport plan and graph on the left .",
    "next , we insert f as pivot element ( right ) and discover the cycle starting in f1 with depth - first search . along the cycle",
    ", the minimum of all nodes on the right side of the graph determines the amount of change @xmath28 which is substracted from b and e ( red ) and added to d and f ( green ) .",
    "one of the two elements b or e will leave the basis .",
    "f2 was not required during the pivot operation , but alternatively it would have been possible to use the complementary cycle f2 @xmath33 b1 @xmath33 d2 @xmath33 e1 @xmath33 f2 instead , leading to the same result .",
    "basis elements a and c remain unchanged during this pivot operation .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let us also compare the performances of the best six competitors for our original benchmark to earlier performance studies from the literature . based on the results considered in the lower panel of figure  [ figruntime ] , i.e.  based on problem sizes up to 3000 , several initialization methods performed similarly : the modified column minimum rule , houthakker s method and the alternating row column minimum rule , followed by the modified row minimum rule , the least cost rule and the weighted frequency method .",
    "these results confirm earlier findings reported in @xcite and in @xcite on other benchmarks , with one exception : the least cost rule ( also known as matrix mimimum rule ) performed among the best competitors in our test and finished among the slowest methods in @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is our implementation which sorts all matrix entries once ascendingly by transportation costs and then iterates over the list until the initial solution is obtained .",
    "this procedure is more efficient than determining the matrix cost minimum in each iteration by scanning all remaining origins and destinations .",
    "analogously , we can explain the advantage of the proposed modified russell s method over the original russell s method .",
    "the speedup gained by the avoidance of scanning large parts of the complete matrix in each iteration clearly outweighs a possible quality loss of the initial solution by not updating the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are supposed to approximate the simplex multipliers @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see section  [ sectransportationalgorithm ] ) .    further research includes a systematic large - scale simulation study to determine good universal parameter settings depending only on easy - to - determine features of the problem such as problem size .",
    "also we would like to investigate to what extent computation times and orders of complexity can be improved when comparing images within a homogeneous database , where one has the possibility to train the parameters to the expected type of transportation problem .    in either case",
    "we believe that there is still much room for improvement of the results obtained above .",
    "we expect these findings to prepare the ground for applications in pattern recognition , computer vision and image processing , where solving the transportation problem has so far been considered as intractable due to the problem size and the runtimes of existing methods when applied to ( smaller ) raw gray scale images or feature descriptors like curved gabor filter bank responses @xcite . a selection of further applications is contained in the next section .",
    "solving transportation problems efficiently is of great importance in many different fields of application .",
    "we would like to give an idea of the relevance of fast algorithms by discussing a selection of specific examples .",

    "the speedup by the shortlist method can make a huge difference . e.g.  if web sites are compared at a resolution of @xmath36 pixels , this correponds to a problem with an approximate dimension of 5000 origins and 5000 destinations .    [",
