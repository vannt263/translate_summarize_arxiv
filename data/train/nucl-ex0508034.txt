    "for a number of years partial - wave analysis of baryonic resonances have been extensively studied using mainly @xmath13n@xmath14n , @xmath13n@xmath15n , and @xmath16n@xmath14n reactions @xcite .",
    "the study of the dynamics of the @xmath13n@xmath15n reaction @xcite is also useful for improving our knowledge about meson production , as well as our knowledge of the baryonic resonances .",
    "these resonances have also been studied with pp@xmath0pn@xmath3 reactions @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the masses found by different experiments , remains generally less than 20  mev .",
    "however the widths of these resonances , as reported by the various authors , differ by a large amount .",
    "for example , the width of the n(1440)p@xmath9 resonance , extracted from the @xmath13n@xmath14n reaction , varies between a lower limit of 135@xmath1710  mev and an upper limit of 545@xmath17170  mev @xcite .",
    "moreover , the many theoretical width attributions inside constituent quark models @xcite are often much smaller than those reported by the experiments .",
    "such discrepancies between different experimental results and between calculated and experimental widths have sometimes been emphasized , and have been used for example to test @xcite whether the n(1535)s@xmath9 could be a pentaquark @xmath18 state .",
    "it appears therefore that a study of `` low mass '' baryon resonances with more precise experiments than those previously performed - with a good resolution , small binning , and large statistics - will be a sensitive test for the many existing models .",
    "another important test to select among the models , would be to measure , with a high precision , the branching ratios for various de - excitation modes . in this respect , a recent theoretical work @xcite finds a b@xmath19 ratio for the s@xmath9(1535 ) varying from 29@xmath171@xmath20 up to 67@xmath171@xmath20 depending on the model considered .",
    "this question was also studied in different theoretical papers , with the emphasis on positive and negative parity resonances @xcite , or j@xmath21=3/2@xmath22 resonances @xcite .",
    "+ if we exclude some recent experiments performed at jlab , nearly all previous studies in the non - strange sector , were done without any attempt to have a good resolution , and therefore a suitable binning . now , it is possible to do measurements with a better resolution , and finer binning , than before .",
    "such an experiment was performed at the now defunct saturne synchrotron , on the spes3 beam line .",
    "+ in this paper the data from the p  p  @xmath23  p  p  x and p  p@xmath23  p  @xmath1  x reactions studied at two incident proton energies : t@xmath24=1520  mev and t@xmath24=1805  mev are reported .",
    "the incident energies open up the @xmath5p ( @xmath1n ) and @xmath6p de - excitation channels of the n@xmath3 and @xmath4 baryonic resonances .",
    "for the first reaction , p  p  @xmath23  p  p  x , mass ranges 1470@xmath251585  mev using the lowest incident energy and 1560@xmath251680  mev using the highest incident energy were studied .",
    "the second reaction , p  p@xmath23  p  @xmath1  x , allows the study of the n@xmath1 de - excitation channel of the n@xmath3 and @xmath4 baryonic resonances in the range 1470@xmath261640  mev and with a slight spectrometer angle dependence .",
    "+ the study of nucleon resonances is clearly connected with the production of mesons either close to threshold or at higher energies .",
    "a great number of papers are related to such studies and all these papers can not be quoted here @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ in the baryonic mass range studied in this paper , one major problem is to distinguish between genuine quark model states and exotic states .",
    "unlike the situation at low baryonic masses , where new narrow states are clearly exotic , for the mass range discussed in this work the answer is not so simple , since , as already stated , the calculated widths of quark model states are sometimes much smaller than the experimental widths reported by pdg .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the possibility of connecting new baryons to the `` missing resonances '' predicted by the constituent quark model , but , so far , not observed .",
    "clearly , measurements of as many properties as possible of the baryonic resonance excitations and disintegrations , would be useful .",
    "+ this paper is constructed in the following way : the main properties of the experimental layout are briefly recalled in the second section .",
    "the third section describes the analysis , and details the various intermediate results for one given angle and one given missing mass selection .",
    "the different ways of subtracting events giving the experimental signal but corresponding to the `` uncorrelated '' missing mass contribution ( hereafter called the physical background ) , will be considered .",
    "results are presented and discussed in the fourth section , and are compared with many theoretical quark model results .",
    "a general discussion then follows and the data for several de - excitation branches are compared .",
    "the last section contains a summary of the results and a conclusion . + our results on narrow baryonic resonances in the mass range 1.0@xmath2m@xmath21.46  gev",
    "were already published in @xcite , and those in the mass range 1.72@xmath2m@xmath21.79  gev were previously published in @xcite .",
    "a complete description was already published in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "this desription included a presentation of the experimental set up , as well as the performances of the experimental apparatus , the checks performed , the simulation code used to evaluate raw data normalization , and the various normalizations which had to be introduced .",
    "such a lengthy description will not be repeated here , only the main properties will be given .",
    "+ the measurements were performed at the saturne synchrotron beam facility .",
    "the experimental signature required the simultaneous detection of two positively charged particles , using the spes3 spectrometer and detection system ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "a liquid h@xmath27 target was used .",
    "the spectrometer allowed a large momentum range of the detected particles : 600  mev@xmath28pc@xmath281400  mev at b=3.07  t , with help of several drift chambers .",
    "the trigger consisted of four planes of plastic scintillator hodoscopes .",
    "particles were identified mainly by their time of flight .",
    "the particle momenta were determined using one mit and several cern type drift chambers .",
    "the resolution in the invariant mass spectrum was measured using the final state interaction peak ( fsi ) from the p  p  @xmath0  p  p  x reaction .",
    "it was close to @xmath29  0.9  mev .",
    "the resolution of the missing mass was measured in the neutron missing mass from the p  p  @xmath0  p  @xmath1  x reaction at forward angles .",
    "it was close to @xmath29  2.2  mev at @xmath30=0.75@xmath31 and t@xmath24=1.805  gev . at both incident energies , @xmath32=1520  mev and @xmath32=1805  mev",

    "system . + a simulation code was written in order to check the various properties of the detection system .",
    "it reproduces the position and the width of the neutron missing mass peak @xcite .",
    "the simulation code is used to obtain the contributions of the peaks , by subtraction of the physical smooth uncorrelated invariant masses ( see later , section  iii.b . ) .",
    "in the p  p  @xmath23  p  p  x reaction , each invariant mass @xmath33 studied , has two different kinematical solutions corresponding to different transferred momenta .",
    "2 exhibits the scatterplots of m@xmath34 versus p@xmath35 _ ( i@xmath36j ) _ at t@xmath24=1520  mev , @xmath37 . _",
    "i _ and _ j _ denote the fast ( f ) and slow ( s ) detected protons .",
    "we see clear cuts , created either by physics or by the momenta limits of the spectrometer : 0.6@xmath2pc@xmath21.4  gev .",
    "the data must be studied separately for the two branches , otherwise an artificial peak structure will appear in the case of a simple addition .",
    "all preliminary spectra , versus @xmath38 or @xmath39 , will therefore be presented as belonging to either the `` upper branch '' or `` lower branch '' , depending on whether they are above , or below , the turnback limit in the scatterplots . here ,",
    "@xmath38 or @xmath39 are the invariant masses obtained by using the momenta @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the fast and slow emitted protons respectively .",
    "the two branches were separated through software cuts on the momentum of the proton not included in the invariant mass ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "these cuts create narrow invariant mass regions with incomplete efficiencies .",
    "these narrow ranges are therefore omitted in the spectra . in a few cases ,",
    "the sum of the spectra from both branches is performed ; the eliminated range due to incomplete efficiency is delimited by vertical lines .",
    "the missing masses vary from 0 up to 600  mev at forward angles and for the lowest incident energy .",
    "such a range of results opens up the study of the de - excitation of the baryonic resonances into n@xmath5 and n@xmath6 channels at forward angles ( see fig .",
    "this range does not allow the study of the disintegration into heavier and still narrower mesons ( and nucleons ) . for increasing spectrometer angles , the resolution spoils whilst the maximum missing mass decreases .",
    "the first effect results from the two terms : @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the laboratory angles of both detected protons . at a given angle",
    ", the resolution improves for increasing missing mass ; this property is due to the term @xmath46 + at t@xmath24=1520  mev , the @xmath6 is no longer observable for angles above 9@xmath31 . at this incident energy ,",
    "the n@xmath5 de - excitation channel is observable at all six angles studied .",
    "+ at t@xmath24=1805  mev , the missing mass varies from 300  mev up to 750  mev at forward angles , and varies from 0  mev up to 500  mev at @xmath30=17@xmath31 .",
    "therefore only the n@xmath6 de - excitation channel is studied at forward angles , and n@xmath5 is studied at backward angles .",
    "+ the n@xmath5 ( n@xmath6 ) de - excitation channel is selected through the following software cuts : m@xmath47250  mev ( 540@xmath48565  mev ) .",
    "the range of the invariant masses differs at both incident proton energies : 1470  mev@xmath2m@xmath21585  mev at t@xmath24=1520  mev and 1560@xmath2m@xmath21680  mev at t@xmath24=1805  mev . since these invariant masses are different , the data will be presented and discussed separately in four different subsections .",
    "the simulation code was written in the following way : the events were generated using a flat random distribution of fast proton momenta , and of angular distributions : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . for angles other than forward ones ,",
    "a variable distribution of @xmath49 was introduced between the maximum and minimum possible angles .",
    "a gaussian distribution was introduced for the @xmath6 width .",
    "we take into account the width of the incident beam , the spectrometer resolution , and the detection resolution .",
    "we do not introduce the description ( mass and width ) of any baryonic resonance in the invariant m@xmath53 mass , nor do we introduce a specific disintegration channel for this resonance .",
    "our simulation therefore describes the shape of uncorrelated events .",
    "we expect to observe , if any , correlated p@xmath5 and correlated p@xmath6 events if these give rise to narrow structures in our invariant mass range .",
    "we do not expect to be able to observe the broad pdg baryonic resonances since our mass range is too limited for that and the resonances are mixed . in our relatively small invariant mass range the simulated spectra must be continuous with a slowly varying slope .",

    "again , p  limit is the momentum value of the turnback in the scatterplot of @xmath62 versus @xmath63 where j@xmath36i . both fig .  2 and fig .  8 use the same data , but in the latter the n@xmath6 disintegration channel is selected through software cuts .",
    "the reduction in the invariant mass range is particularly important for insert ( b ) of fig .",
    "when applying the same selection at other angles , namely when we observe m@xmath64 with p@xmath65 larger than p@xmath65limit , and select the n@xmath6 disintegration channel , we obtain a small increase in the statistics for increasing angles up to 9@xmath31 , followed by a decrease .",
    "given the weak statistics , this last selection of events will not be presented for this disintegration channel at this incident proton energy .",
    "+ table  ii shows that the same mass values and nearly the same widths are obtained from a gaussian fit of the last insert ( c ) of fig .",
    "the range of insert ( b ) is too small to allow to a peak to be extracted ; the values extracted from inserts ( a ) and ( c ) are consistent with the few existing data points .",
    "the `` background '' is constructed by a normalized addition of the total invariant @xmath66 mass in both parts , below and above the @xmath6 meson mass in the missing mass spectrum .",

    "i , the last line shows the properties of the extracted peaks , which all have the same mass and the same width as before when the simulated `` background '' is used .",
    "the relative surface of the peaks , obtained with help of both `` backgrounds '' , moves a little , but has no influence on the discussion which will be presented later .",
    "such an agreement between masses and widths , obtained with help of both choices for the `` background '' , allows us to keep the simulated `` background '' for the other data presented later on .",
    "when the physical `` background '' is used , the ranges of background selected on either side of the peak are at least 37.5  mev away from the central peak .",
    "this avoids including an eventual @xmath6 meson tail if it is present .",
    "one direct consequence of this is an irregular shape on the high mass side of the background spectrum as shown in fig .",

    "indeed , pdg reports for n@xmath3(1535 ) a width varying from 57 up to 240@xmath1780  mev .",
    "although it is rather difficult to draw a background below the m=1535  mev peak , we estimate , at @xmath30=0@xmath31 and 2@xmath31 , that the maximum of this m@xmath721535  mev peak amounts to @xmath7230@xmath20 of the total excitation at this mass . there is also , at this mass , room for contributions from other pdg baryonic resonances with smaller and larger masses , and also contributions from n@xmath13 and n@xmath73 incoherent phase space contributions .",

    "the data were obtained with binnings close to 20  mev . + the total and differential cross - sections of the baryonic production in nucleon - nucleon reactions , were calculated in the one - boson exchange model @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that their model , after adjustement to the elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering , agree with the experiment .",
    "+ many models of baryonic resonances were proposed ( see ref .",
    "the quark models are restricted to the assumption of @xmath109 wave functions , without considering additionnal @xmath110 pairs or gluonic contributions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these calculations are often related to the search for `` missing baryons '' which possibly couple weakly to the n@xmath13 channel @xcite .",
    "the low - lying baryon spectrum was calculated within the chiral constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "the light - baryon spectrum was calculated within a relativistic quark model with instanton - induced quark forces @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the three - particle bethe - salpeter equation , a good description of the overall baryonic mass spectrum up to the highest spin states was obtained @xcite . + the properties of baryon resonances in the mass range studied in this paper , were calculated @xcite using @xmath13n data and a multichannel unitary model .",
    "the authors found `` results similar to previous analyses for strongly excited states , but the results can vary considerably when the states are weak '' .",
    "they emphasize `` that the full width of the s@xmath9(1535 ) varies largely , due to the close proximity of the resonance pole to the @xmath6n threshold '' .",
    "it is worthwile to note that the widths found in the calculation of @xcite are consistent , for the s@xmath9(1535 ) , with our `` experimental total '' width obtained by combining the shift between the extreme masses : 1505  mev and 1577  mev , and the width of each narrow structure .",
    "indeed , the calculated width in @xcite for @xmath6n is @xmath111=66@xmath1713  mev , and the calculated width for @xmath13n is @xmath111=77@xmath1717  mev .",
    "+ several recent works investigate the baryon spectroscopy in lattice qcd @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the discussion of these results is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "using the spes3 spectrometer and detection system at saturne , the pp@xmath0p@xmath1x and pp@xmath0ppx reactions were studied at two incident energies : t@xmath24=1520  mev and 1805  mev . with the help of software cuts on the missing mass spectra ,",
    "the following final states were selected : p@xmath5 , n@xmath1 , and p@xmath6 .",
    "the n@xmath73 final state contributed to the physical background . due to the good resolution and reasonable statistics",
    ", we were able to observe in the range 1.47@xmath2m@xmath21.68  gev , a large number of narrow and well separated peaks . in some cases the peak to",
    "background ratio is not large , therefore a peak is only considered as a narrow baryonic resonance when several peaks are extracted at the same mass ( @xmath173  mev ) , and in different experimental data sets .",
    "the widths of these peaks are low as compared to the widths reported by the pdg .",
    "+ we have separated the narrow states observed into two classes : those where a de - excitation into a n@xmath6 final state was observed and those where this was not the case . when combining the masses of narrow states seen in both n@xmath6 and n@xmath13 final states , we tentatively identify them as being `` fine structures '' of n@xmath3(1535)s@xmath9 and n@xmath3(1650)s@xmath9 . in the same way",
    ", the masses not observed in the n@xmath6 final state are tentatively identified as being `` fine structures '' of n@xmath3(1520 ) and @xmath10(1600)p@xmath11 .",
    "such assumptions give , for each case , a mean mass that is in fairly good agreement with the mass of the broad pdg baryonic resonance .",
    "such a description could also justify the different mean masses sometimes observed when different reactions are used . for example the mass of the n(1535)s@xmath9 was found at m=1549@xmath172  mev from the @xmath112p@xmath113p reaction @xcite and at m=1525@xmath1710  mev from the @xmath16n@xmath14n reaction @xcite .",
    "also , the calculated partial widths are generally too small to account for the experimental values of broad pdg baryons @xcite .",
    "+ by analogy with nuclear physics , we suggest that the previously broad pdg baryonic resonances , are in fact collective states of several weakly excited and narrow resonances .",
    "these resonances , can be single - particles or quasi - particles ( from constituent quark ) states , with quark structures more complicated than @xmath114 .",
    "we suggest that the reason for which these narrow weakly excited peaks were not observed till now , is due to the lack of experimental precision of previous experiments .",
    "+ it is clear that these observations - if confirmed by other experiments - would be a milestone in hadron spectroscopy , and would impose a big challenge to hadron theorists .",
    "the hadron structure is more rich than has been often though up till now .",
    "its study requires non - pertubative methods in the mass range studied in this paper .",
    "it remains to explain the small widths observed .",
    "one possibility may be that there exists some `` quark tunnelling '' from one quark - cluster to another .",
    "it is then possible that new theoretical tools will have to be developed .",
    "indeed , a complete description of hadrons should incorporate valence quarks , sea quarks , and gluonic degrees of freedom .",
