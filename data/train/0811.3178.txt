    "vortices in superconductors interacting with artificial arrays of periodic pinning exhibit a wide range of commensurability and dynamical effects that can be observed readily in critical current , transport , and other bulk measurements @xcite .",
    "advances in lithography techniques permit the creation of pinning arrays in which the size , shape , and composition of the individual pinning sites and the global geometry can be well controlled @xcite .",
    "commensurability effects in these systems occur when the number of vortices equals an integer multiple of the number of pinning sites , resulting in peaks or anomalies in bulk measurements as a function of field . at the first matching field , there is one vortex per pinning site , and as the field is further increased , additional vortices can be located either at the pinning sites in the form of pinned multi - quanta vortices @xcite , or in the interstitial regions between the pinning sites .",
    "the interstitial vortices can be effectively pinned by the repulsive interactions from the vortices at the pinning sites , which create a caging potential @xcite .",
    "it is also possible for mixed vortex pinning to occur in which the first few matching fields have only pinned multi - quanta vortices until the pinning sites are saturated , while for higher matching fields the additional vortices are located in the interstitial regions @xcite .",
    "conversely , it is also possible that interstitial vortices appear at the lower matching fields , but that as the vortex - vortex interactions increase at higher matching fields , multi - quanta vortices will begin to form at the pinning sites @xcite .    interstitial vortex lattice crystals in square periodic pinning arrays",
    "have been observed directly with lorentz microscopy , which revealed that there are several distinct types of interstitial vortex structures that have symmetries different from that of the triangular vortex lattice @xcite . the same types of vortex structures have been produced in simulations of square pinning arrays @xcite , while simulations have also shown that similar vortex structures can form in triangular @xcite , rectangular @xcite , honeycomb @xcite , and kagom ' e pinning arrays @xcite .",
    "other numerical works indicated that a rich variety of composite lattices with multiple and interstitial vortex configurations are possible @xcite and that new types of interstitial vortex configurations can occur for arrays of antipinning sites @xcite .",
    "vortex imaging experiments provide direct evidence for both multi - quanta vortex pinning and the formation of ordered interstitial vortex lattice structures @xcite .",
    "anomalies at matching fields found in bulk measurements occur for both multi - quanta vortex pinning and interstitial vortex pinning , so without direct imaging it can be difficult to determine whether multi - quanta or interstitial vortex pinning is occurring @xcite . in some cases , the presence of interstitial vortices can only be inferred from the shapes and characteristics of the current voltage curves or from phase locking experiments @xcite .",
    "it would be highly desirable to identify additional clear signatures in transport measurements that can distinguish between interstitial vortex pinning and multi - quanta vortex pinning and that can also reveal the types of vortex lattice symmetries that are present .",
    "an anisotropic response was recently measured for the critical current applied in two perpendicular directions to a triangular pinning array in recent experiments and simulations @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed on several different samples and the same anisotropic response appeared in each one , while the anisotropy observed in the simulations agreed with that seen in the experiments , suggesting that the behavior is due to distinct intrinsic features of the vortex dynamics .",
    "the simulations show that the vortex flow patterns are different for the two directions of applied current , which could account for the anisotropic response .",
    "the anisotropy is particularly pronounced at the second matching field but is absent at the first matching field , which suggests that depinning of the interstitial vortices is responsible for the anisotropy .",
    "interestingly , for lower temperatures the experiments showed that the critical current anisotropy vanished at both the first and second matching fields but persisted at the third matching field , suggesting that multi - quanta vortex pinning occurs at the second matching field at low temperatures .",
    "these results indicate that the presence of anisotropy can be a useful way to probe the interstitial vortex state and the type of vortex ordering that occurs at different matching fields .    the experiments and simulations of refs .",
    "@xcite only examined a triangular pinning array up to the third matching field . in this work we study anisotropic transport for a much wider range of fields and system parameters for triangular , square , honeycomb , and kagom ' e pinning arrays . for the triangular array",
    "we find a variety of distinct anisotropic behaviors due to the differing symmetries of the interstitial vortex lattice at different matching fields .",
    "for example , at certain matching fields the vortex lattice is disordered and the anisotropy vanishes .",
    "for honeycomb and kagom ' e pinning arrays , an even richer anisotropic behavior occurs due to the formation of vortex molecular crystal states @xcite with additional rotational degrees of freedom , resulting in a series of reversals in the anisotropy as a function of field .",
    "remarkably , we find that it is also possible for square pinning arrays to show anisotropic transport even though the two perpendicular directions of the pinning lattice are identical .",
    "this occurs at certain matching fields where a triangular vortex structure forms , such that one driving direction is oriented with the easy - shear direction of the vortex lattice .",
    "anisotropic transport measurements for vortices in periodic pinning arrays have already been been shown to be experimentally feasible , and experiments have been performed in which the current is injected in two directions for samples with rectangular pinning arrays or asymmetric pinning shapes , revealing anisotropic depinning thresholds @xcite . although our work is focused on superconducting vortices , our results should be general to the class of systems of particles interacting with periodic substrates where both pinned and interstitial particles are present .",

    "the easy - flow direction for square lattices is not fixed but depends on which of the two degenerate ground states is formed by the initial vortex lattice . a sufficiently large applied drive realigns the vortex lattice and sets the easy - flow direction in the direction of the drive . if the initial vortex lattice formed with domains of the two degenerate ground states , the domains can be eliminated and a pure ground state formed simply by sweeping the driving force .",
    "the anisotropic depinning behavior of this pure state can then be probed with small drives .",
    "honeycomb and kagom ' e pinning arrays have a smaller anisotropy than that seen for the triangular and square arrays .",
