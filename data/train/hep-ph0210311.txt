    "the underlying quark constituent nature of hadrons is taken into account but implementation of chiral symmetry ( cs ) becomes difficult . in the region of low energies",
    ", it seems appropriate to start considering the hadrons as the relevant degrees of freedom where cs not only proves helpful to restrict the type of interactions between mesons and baryons , but also provides an indirect link to the underlying quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . for processes involving baryons and mesons , heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt )  @xcite incorporates cs at low energies in a systematic way , and",
    "has provided a satisfactory description of @xmath19 scattering in the region around threshold  @xcite .",
    "it suffers , however , from known limitations .",
    "firstly , the expansion is manifestly not relativistically invariant , and some convergence problems , specially for the scalar form factor , have been pointed out and solved by defining a suitable regularization scheme , the so - called infrared regularization ( ir )  @xcite .",
    "the ir scheme has also successfully been applied to @xmath19 elastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "the previous remarks concern a theory with only @xmath20 and @xmath21 present .",
    "the @xmath22 degrees of freedom have been explicitly included  @xcite within the hbchpt scheme , where the nucleon-@xmath22 splitting is considered to be of order of the pion mass , pointing toward a better convergence for the @xmath19 scattering data than the case without explicit @xmath22 s .",
    "more recently , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite has compared the hbchpt scheme to the ir one in the presence of explicit @xmath22 s degrees of freedom for @xmath19 scattering , showing that hbchpt describes data up to much higher pion cm kinetic energies than the ir method .",
    "a second limitation of any of the previous approaches , both in the hbchpt as well as in the ir frameworks and with or without explicit @xmath22 , is that they are based on a perturbative expansion of a finite amount of feynman diagrams .",
    "this complies with unitarity order by order in the expansion , but fails to fulfill exact unitarity of the scattering amplitude .",
    "thus , some non - perturbative resummation should be supplemented to incorporate exact unitarity and , hopefully , to accommodate resonances . regarding this second limitation ,",
    "several unitarization methods have been suggested in the literature and previously used to describe the meson - baryon dynamics : inverse amplitude method ( iam )  @xcite , or a somehow modified iam to account for the large baryon masses  @xcite , dispersion relations  @xcite , lippmann - schwinger equation ( lse ) and bethe - salpeter equation ( bse )  @xcite .    in this work , we will study the @xmath0wave meson - baryon scattering for the strangeness @xmath1 and isospin @xmath2 sector in a bethe - salpeter coupled channel formalism incorporating cs .",
    "this reaction provides a good example of the need of unitarization methods ; the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that hbchpt to one loop fails completely already at threshold .",
    "the @xmath4 scattering length turns out to have a real part about the same size but with opposite sign and half the imaginary expected experimentally  @xcite , due to the the nearby subthreshold @xmath23-resonance .",
    "it is important to realize from the very beginning that , for this particular resonance , the unitarization program implies at least considering two channels , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , one deals with a coupled channel problem",
    ". unfortunately , there are no one - loop chpt calculations incorporating this coupled channel physics .",
    "much of the discussion below and the rest of the paper reflects this lack of knowledge on the general structure of this scattering amplitude within chpt , particularly on the number of undetermined parameters .",
    "of course , not all counterterms are independent , as demanded by crossing and chiral symmetries .",
    "actually , the best practical way to impose these constraints on a unitarized partial wave amplitude is by matching to a chpt amplitude .",
    "the reason for this is that the left - cut partial wave analytical structure implied by crossing would be automatically incorporated within a one - loop chpt calculation .",
    "this point of view has been used in several unitarization approaches for the elastic @xmath19 process  @xcite . there",
    ", the chpt amplitude is known up to one - loop  @xcite which in hbchpt corresponds to third and fourth order .",
    "this is the lowest order approximation incorporating the perturbative unitarity correction which is required to match the perturbative amplitude to a unitarized one .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the coupled channel chpt one - loop amplitude for meson - baryon scattering is not known , and thus the matching is not possible .",
    "the first study of the strangeness @xmath1 and isospin @xmath2 meson - baryon channel incorporating cs and coupled channel unitarization was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , though some phenomenological form factors were employed .",
    "more recently , this channel has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , where a three - momentum cut - off is used to renormalize the lse and the off - shell behavior is partially taken into account . in principle , the minimal renormalization procedure used in refs .",
    "@xcite is acceptable but may turn out to be too restrictive in practice . if , instead , one takes advantage of the flexibility allowed by the renormalization of an effective field theory ( eft ) , there is a chance of improving the description from threshold up to higher energies . in practical terms",
    "this means increasing the number of counter terms which one has to add to make finite the amplitudes . along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will adopt this viewpoint below by taking fully into account the off - shellness suggested by the bse using the tree level amplitude as the lowest order approximation to the potential . in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite there are three parameters for each channel . in the absence of a one - loop chpt coupled channel amplitude , we content ourselves with matching to the tree level one .",
    "scattering ; from there one easily realizes that the renormalization scheme pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite would lead to a scenario where only one of the four @xmath24gasser - leutwyler @xmath25 and @xmath26 parameters is independent .",
    "] one could also match the coupled channel unitarized amplitude to hbchpt , much below the inelastic thresholds .",
    "this procedure was investigated in ref .",

    "@xcite in describing the data around the antikaon - nucleon threshold , including the features of the @xmath12 @xmath13(1405 ) resonance , its predictions for higher energies  @xcite do not work so well and clear discrepancies with data appear .",
    "indeed , the limitations of the model of ref .  @xcite did already appear in the strangeness @xmath27 and isospin @xmath28 meson - baryon sector , where the model is able to describe data only in a more or less narrow energy window around the @xmath29 resonance  @xcite . however , the model previously developed by two of us for the latter channel in ref .",
    "@xcite describes data in a wider energy region , ranging from @xmath19 threshold up to almost a center of mass ( cm ) meson - baryon energy of @xmath30 gev , including the features of a second resonance ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "motivated by these encouraging results we extend in this work the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to the strangeness @xmath1 and isospin @xmath2 meson - baryon channel . like in the @xmath27 sector , taking into account the off - shellness of the bse generates a rich structure of unknown constants which allow for a better description of the amplitudes . although the generation of more undetermined constants may appear a less predictive approach than putting a cut - off ( one single parameter ) to regularize the divergent integrals , it reflects the real state of the art of our lack of knowledge on the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "the number of adjustable low energy constants ( lec s ) should not be smaller than those allowed by the symmetry ; this is the only way both to falsify all possible theories embodying the same symmetry principles and to widen the energy interval which is being described .",
    "limiting such a rich structure allowed by cs results in a poor description of experimental data .",
    "however , a possible redundancy of parameters is obviously undesirable but may be detected through statistical considerations ( see below ) .",
    "the number of lec s is controlled to any order of the calculation by crossing symmetry . in a unitarized approach ,",
    "the only way to avoid this parameter redundancy is to match the unitarized amplitude to the one obtained from a lagrangian formalism .",
    "there is no standard one loop chpt calculation for the meson - baryon reaction with open channels to compare with .",
    "some results there exist within the hbchpt scheme , up to order @xmath32  being @xmath33 a typical baryon mass  but only involving pions and nucleons  @xcite .",
    "an indirect way to detect such a parameter redundancy might be through a fit to experimental data if the errors and correlations in some parameters turn out to be very large .",
    "we will adopt this point of view in this work , and will show that indeed correlations take place effectively reducing the total number of independent parameters .    in this paper",
    "four coupled channels have been considered : @xmath34 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 and taken into account @xmath35breaking symmetry effects but neglected the considerably smaller isospin violation ones .",

    "@xcite , the description of data achieved in our approach is superior to that of ref .",
    "a similar situation was already found also in the strangeness @xmath27",
    "sector  @xcite .",
    "according to previous experience , the reduction of parameters is partly due to the constraint of a well defined heavy baryon limit  @xcite . likewise , crossing symmetry is expected to shed more light on the number of independent lec s . as we have argued , matching to hbchpt calculations in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sector would be the ideal way to map our lec s into those stemming from an effective chiral lagrangian , but it is already known that the chiral expansion fails  @xcite to reproduce the @xmath4 scattering length , due to the influence of the nearby subthreshold @xmath127 resonance .",
    "possibly this could be overcome by properly accounting for the singularity structure as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "we believe these points deserve a deeper investigation .",
    "we have undertaken a careful discussion on the analytical structure of the scattering matrix amplitude in the complex @xmath0plane , which becomes mandatory in order to extract the features of the @xmath135 resonances .",
    "we have searched for poles in the second riemann sheet and compared masses , widths and branching ratios to data .",
    "the agreement is also quite satisfactory . in the resonance region",
    "our unitary amplitude can not be analyzed as a breit - wigner resonance due to a sizeably non - diagonal background in coupled channel space .",
    "this , in particular , prevents from a simple interpretation of branching ratios .",
    "although residues at the resonance poles are well and unambiguously defined , the definition of branching ratios requires special considerations and provisos , due to an ambiguous extrapolation of the resonance contribution of the s - matrix from the pole to the scattering line .",
    "we have also illustrated that looking for a good description of experimentally accessible data is not sufficient and that , in some cases , it can be achieved at the expense of generating non - physically acceptable poles in the first riemann sheet , which influence on the scattering region is non - negligible .",
    "thus , any fit to data should be supplemented by this additional requirement of not producing spurious singularities numerically relevant for the description of scattering processes .",

    "in figs .  ( [ fig:1-m]-[fig:3-m ] ) we present the results of a fit to the data , which we will show is not physically acceptable .",
    "the overall description of data is remarkably good .",
    "this fit gives @xmath248 to compare with the value of 0.93 of the best fit presented in the main text .",
    "however , when looking at the @xmath78 matrix in the @xmath0complex plane ( fig .",
    "( [ fig : riemman - m ] ) ) , one realizes that there exists a proliferation of poles , some of them unphysical and others with no experimental counterparts . in the first riemann sheet we find at least two poles",

    "[ sec : reso ] , our preferred fit has also a similar unphysical pole but significantly farther ( @xmath254  mev ) from the real axis , and therefore with a tiny influence on the physical scattering .",
    "since causality imposes the absence of poles in the physical sheet  @xcite , the existence of such a pole affecting the scattering line invalidates the description ( figs .",
    "( [ fig:1-m]-[fig:3-m ] ) ) presented in this appendix , despite of its quality . besides in the first sheet , there exists a pole on the real axis ( @xmath255 mev ) and below the first threshold , which would correspond to a bound state , stable under strong interactions .",
    "such a state has the same quantum numbers as the @xmath256 and it should show up in all reactions where the latter one is produced .    on the other hand , in the second sheet there exist now four poles .",
