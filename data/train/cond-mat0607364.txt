    "the nature of the spectrum of light scattering from a crystal has been understood qualitatively ever since the discovery of the effect in 1928 by c. v. raman .",
    "raman scattering has been extensively studied for several years now and a vast quantity of both experimental and theoretical knowledge has been accumulated @xcite . here , we discuss briefly only the development of the theory of raman scattering from crystals near displacive phase transition using green s functions .",
    "semiclassical theory of raman scattering has been discussed by born and huang @xcite the initial development of the theory of raman scattering has been reviewed by many authors .",
    "@xcite an attempt to develop the theory was made by loudon @xcite .",
    "he assumed that the raman scattering by phonons in a crystal occurs through a process in which the incident light excites a virtual electron - hole pair , which either creates or absorbs one phonon ( or more ) and then recombines , emitting the scattered photon . using third order time dependent perturbation theory , he developed expressions for the polarizability tensor of the crystal .",
    "based on this approach , loudon made estimates of the raman cross section for diamond and zinc sulphide structures which were in order of magnitude agreement with the experimental observation .",
    "but detailed evaluation of the expressions requires knowledge of the electron - band structure and electron phonon coupling in the crystal which is not normally available .",
    "another approach is the expansion technique of the born and bradburn @xcite . in this approach",
    "it is assumed that the elements of the polarizability tensor can be expanded formally in the powers of the displacements of the atoms from their mean positions .",
    "this technique necessarily involves too many arbitrary parameters and assumptions .",
    "another attempt to develop the theory of raman scattering by phonons was by * cowley in 1964 * @xcite and later by * bruce and cowley * @xcite .",
    "they developed the theory in terms of shell model concepts and used it to calculate the two phonon spectrum of alkali halides by assuming that the raman scattering arises from non - linearity in the shell - core intra - ion interactions .",
    "quite reasonable agreements with the experimental results in nai and kbr were obtained .",
    "the results are considerably improved by using the breathing shell model @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that inter - ionic non - linearities are far less important for describing raman scattering than intra - ionic terms . using this model ,",
    "the two phonon raman spectrum of srti@xmath0 in x(yy)z configuration has been calculated by stirling @xcite .",
    "the results give the principal features of the experimental spectrum .",
    "migoni et al.@xcite have used a non - linear shell model to explain the second order raman scattering and temperature dependence of the ferroelectric soft - mode in the ab@xmath0 perovskites .",
    "they assume an anisotropy in the oxygen polarizability .",
    "this implies that the strong raman scattering and the behaviour of the ferro - electric soft - mode in the perovskites containing oxygen originate from the universal anisotropic polarizability of oxygen .",
    "the calculations have been done for srti@xmath0 and kta@xmath0 and fairly reasonable agreement has been obtained with the experimental results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra .",
    "but the @xmath3 component of the raman tensor vanishes identically in this model .",

    "using schwabl s theory of soft mode and central peak @xcite , we have developed the theory of raman scattering near displacive phase transitions in terms of green s functions and applied it to calculate the critical integrated raman scattering intensity from srti@xmath4 near the cubic - tetragonal phase transition @xcite .",

    ", we get @xmath7 where n is the number of unit cells in the crystal .",
    "since the raman scattering arises from the change in the number of phonons in the crystal ,    we may expand the polarizability operators in the powers of phonon coordinates @xcite .",

    "<S> + using schwabl s semi - phenomenological theory for the soft mode and central peak , we have developed ( a ) a one - phonon green s function exhibiting the three peaked structure and ( b ) a two phonon green s function involving one hard mode under damped quasiharmonic phonon and one three peaked soft - mode phonon . </S>",
    "<S> + we have developed the pre - cursor order induced raman scattering near the displacive phase transition in terms of green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> + using group theory , we have predicted the raman - active modes in strontium titanate contributing to critical raman scattering near hard - mode frequencies above and below critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> + we have calculated the critical integrated raman scattering intensity and the two - phonon background raman scattering intensity near hard - mode frequencies above and below the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> + the results show the same trends as observed in some of the experimental observations . </S>"
