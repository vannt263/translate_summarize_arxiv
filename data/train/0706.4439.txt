    "the study of very high energy ( vhe , @xmath1 gev ) @xmath0-ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is one of the major goals of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "the sensitivity of the current imaging air cerenkov telescopes ( iact ) enables phenomenological studies of the physics inside the relativistic jets in blazars , and in particular advances in understanding both the origin of the vhe @xmath0-rays as well as the relations between photons of different energies ( from radio to vhe ) .    except for the radio galaxy m87 ,",
    "all 17 currently known vhe gamma - ray emitting agns @xcite are blazars , rwagner / sources/ for an up - to - date source list . ] which are characterized by a close orientation of the jets with the line of sight .",
    "their spectra are dominated by non - thermal emission that consists of two distinct broad components . while the low energy bump , located at optical to x - ray energies , is unisonously explained by synchrotron emission of electrons , the origin of the high - energy part of the spectrum is still debated .",
    "leptonic models ascribe it to inverse compton processes that either up - scatter synchrotron photons , or to external photons that originate from the accretion disk , from nearby massive stars , or are reflected into the jet by surrounding material . in hadronic models , interactions of a highly relativistic jet outflow with ambient matter , proton - induced cascades , or synchrotron radiation off protons , are responsible for the high energy photons .",
    "another defining property of blazars is the high variability of their emission ranging from radio to @xmath0-rays . for vhe",
    "@xmath0-ray blazars , correlations between x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission have been found on time scales ranging from several 10 minutes to days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the relation has proven to be rather complicated .    here",
    "we present selected results for magic blazar observations of mkn  421 , mkn  501 , 1es2344 + 514 , pg 1553 + 113 , and bl  lacert .",
    "magic @xcite is located on the canary island of la palma ( 2200  m a.s.l . ) and is currently the largest iact .",
    "its energy range spans from 60  gev ( trigger threshold at small zenith angles ) up to tens of tev .",
    "magic has a sensitivity of @xmath2  2.5% of the crab nebula flux in 50 observation hours .",
    "its energy resolution is about 30% above 100 gev and about 25% from 200 gev onwards .",
    "the magic standard analysis chain is described e.g. by @xcite .",
    "observations during moderate moonshine enable a substantially extended duty cycle @xcite , which is particularly important for blazar observations .",
    "parallel optical observations are performed with the kva 35  cm telescope .",
    "the magic agn observation program encompasses over 500 hours / year . besides participating in various multiwavelength campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and many _ target of opportunity _ observation agreements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magic is cooperating with other cerenkov telescopes as to extend the dynamical range and/or the time coverage of observations @xcite and monitors some well - known bright blazars on a regular basis @xcite .",
    "apart from having observed previously known blazars , magic has also newly discovered a couple of blazars in vhe @xmath0-rays , as 1es1218 + 30.4 @xcite , mkn 180 @xcite , pg 1553 + 113 @xcite , and recently bl  lacert@xcite .",
    "mkn  421 is the closest ( @xmath3 ) known tev blazar and , along with mkn  501 , also the best studied one .",
    "it has shown variations larger than one order of magnitude and occasional flux doubling times as short as 15 minutes  @xcite .",
    "variations in the hardness of the tev @xmath0-ray spectrum during flares were reported by several groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simultaneous observations in the x - ray and vhe bands showed a significant correlation of the respective fluxes @xcite .",
    "mkn  421 was observed with magic during 19 nights for a total of 25.6 hours , with observation times per night ranging from 30 minutes up to 4 hours .",
    "it was found to be in a medium flux state ranging from 0.5 to 2 crab units above 200  gev .",
    "significant variations of up to an overall factor of four and up to a factor two between successive nights were found . a clear correlation between the @xmath4  kev x - ray count rate , obtained from the public rxte all - sky monitor data , and the vhe @xmath0-ray flux can be described well by both a linear fit ( correlation coefficient @xmath5 ) and a parabolic fit ( both forced to go through the origin ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of mkn 421 , for the first time measured down to @xmath6  gev , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:421:3 ] along with the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum .",
    "the latter has been obtained by correcting for @xmath7 absorption effects caused by extragalactic background light ( ebl ; hauser & dwek 2001 ) , using the recent ebl model of @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum is clearly curved , implying that the curvature in the measured spectrum has an intrinsic origin rather than being caused by ebl absorption .",
    "both a power - law+exponential cutoff fit and a curved power - law fit indicate a flattening of the spectrum towards 100  gev .",
    "the spectrum is hardening with an increasing flux level ( fig .",
    "[ fig:421:4 ] ) .",
    "the analysis is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "mkn 501 ( @xmath8 ) is known to be a strong and variable vhe @xmath0-ray emitter . during a flare in 1997",
    "mkn  501 showed strong variability on timescales of 0.5 days , and the integral flux reached 10 times the flux of the crab nebula above @xmath9  tev ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while a correlation between spectral hardness and @xmath0-ray flux was found , the position of the inverse compton peak could not be detected .",
    "magic observed mkn  501 for 24 nights during six weeks in summer 2005 .",
    "about 18  hours out of the total 30 observation hours were performed in the presence of ( moderate ) moonshine . during most of the observations",
    "the source was in a rather low flux state , corresponding to 30% of the crab nebula flux at @xmath10  gev . in two nights ( one with moon present ) , however , mkn 501 was reaching up to four times the crab nebula flux .",
    "a correlation between spectral hardness and vhe @xmath0-ray flux was found also for mkn 501 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:501:4 ] ) . for the flare nights , a clear peak in the spectrum",
    "is seen ( e.g. , fig .  [ fig:501:5 ] ) . in leptonic models",
    "it can be identified with the `` inverse compton peak '' , which now for the first time is seen unambiguously in vhe range for blazars",
    ".    a closer look at the two flare nights reveals rapid flux changes with doubling times as short as 3 minutes or less ( fig .",
    "[ fig:501:2 ] ) , while constant background rates assure that no instrumental effects are responsible for these .",
    "[ fig:501:3 ] shows corresponding light curves in different , distinct energy bands between 150 gev and 10 tev .",
    "interestingly the flares in the two nights behave differently : while the 2005 june 30 flare is only visible in 250 gev to 1.2 tev , the 2005 july 09 flare is apparent in all energy bands , and a marginal time delay towards higher energies is visible . for the first time , short ( @xmath11  20 min ) flares with a resolved time structure can now be subjected to detailed studies of particle acceleration and cooling timescales .",
    "the analysis and more results are shown in @xcite .",
    "1es2344 + 514 ( @xmath12 ) was detected in vhe @xmath0-rays in 1995/6 on the @xmath13 level @xcite . over 1/3 of the excess",
    "was recorded during one night in december 1995 with @xmath14  64% of the crab nebula flux .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission was confirmed on a @xmath15 significance level by @xcite in observations in 1997 - 2002 .    in 2005 , magic saw a clear @xmath16 excess from the direction of 1es2344 + 514 .",
    "the measured flux corresponds to 10% of the crab nebula flux ( @xmath17  gev ) . for the first time a diurnal measurement of the emission of this blazar was possible , yielding no strong evidence for significant variability on times scales of days and thus giving first insights to the day - scale properties of a low blazar emission state .",
    "the differential energy spectrum can be fitted by a simple power law with a photon index of @xmath18 .",
    "the derived spectrum is softer than the one reported by the whipple collaboration during the flare in 1995 @xcite .",
    "details on the analysis are given in @xcite .",
    "based on its sed properties , pg 1553 + 113 was one of the most promising candidates for vhe @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the blazar was observed in 2005/6 , yielding a @xmath0-ray signal at a significance level of @xmath19 .",
    "there is no evidence for short term variability on a time scale of days , but a significant change by a factor of three in the flux level from 2005 to 2006 was found . the vhe @xmath0-ray flux was not found to correlate with a substantial brightening of the source in the optical @xmath20-band around mjd 53820 ( fig .  [ fig:1553:2 ] ) .",
    "the differential energy spectrum for pg 1553 + 113 is well described by a pure power law with a photon index of @xmath21 , the steepest photon index observed so far for blazars ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1553:3 ] ) .",
    "the signal detected by magic confirms a tentative signal seen by h.e.s.s . at a higher energy threshold with data taken at about the same time as magic in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the source , therefore , can now be considered as a firmly established vhe @xmath0-ray emitter .",
    "details of the analysis are given in @xcite .",
    "the distance of pg  1553 + 113 is currently unknown , despite several attempts of determining its redshift ( direct measurements : @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "the objects shows no emission lines , which probably implies a close alignment of the jet with the line of sight , or a jet outshining the galaxy core . using the observed spectrum of pg 1553 + 113 and assuming a minimum possible density of the evolving ebl ( lower limit in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an upper limit of @xmath23 can be inferred when requiring the intrinsic photon index @xmath24 .",
    "other works employ sed fits @xcite , the structure of the intrinsic spectrum @xcite , or blazar ensemble arguments @xcite to determine redshift limits .",
    "bllacert  ( @xmath25 ) is the historical prototype of the bl  lac class of agns . unlike for the up to recently known `` vhe blazars '' with their synchrotron peaks in the x - ray domain ,",
    "the peak of its synchrotron emission is located in the sub - millimeter to optical band ( @xmath26  hz ) .",
    "22.2 hours of magic observations of bl lacert  from august to december 2005 resulted in a @xmath27 vhe @xmath0-ray signal . above 200 gev ,",
    "an integral flux of @xmath28 was measured , corresponding to approximately 3% of the crab nebula flux .",
    "no significant evidence of flux variability was found .",
    "optical and radio data shows enhanced flux levels during the observations ; while the vhe @xmath0-ray flux shows similar variations , no correlation can be claimed at this point .",
    "the differential spectrum between 150 and 900 gev was found to be rather steep , with a photon index of @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to a 1997 flare of bllacert , which necessitated external photon fields to explain the vhe @xmath0 emission @xcite , the magic observations can be accommodated in a simple ssc model .",
    "the detection is described in @xcite .",
