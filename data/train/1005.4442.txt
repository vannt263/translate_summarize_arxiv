    "the differential growth of thin elastic sheets can generate highly non - trivial configurations such as the multiple generation of waves along the edge of a torn elastic sheet @xcite and the wrinkled patterns on leaves @xcite .",
    "recently , environmentally responsive gel disks of uniform thickness have been created in the laboratory that mimic this type of growth by differentially shrinking in the radial direction when thermally activated in a hot water bath @xcite .",
    "the rate of shrinkage can be controlled , allowing for the creation of regions in the disk that shrink at different rates upon activation .",
    "rippling occurs in regions that shrink slower than the center of the disk while regions that shrink faster obtain a spherical dome like shape .",
    "geometrically , these regions have positive and negative gaussian curvature respectively and by tuning the composition of the gel , different curvatures can be selected .",
    "this type of growth can be used to generate a multitude of different shapes of varying geometries , but a mathematical framework that can accurately predict the equilibrium shapes is lacking .",
    "classically , thin elastic plates have been modeled by the fppl ",
    "von krmn ( fvk ) equations that reduce the full three dimensional equations of elasticity to a coupled system of partial differential equations defined on the mid - surface of the plate @xcite .",
    "these equations are asymptotically valid in the small thickness regime if the thickness scales in a particular manner with external loadings @xcite , and different scalings lead to a hierarchy of different plate models that includes fvk @xcite .",
    "the fvk equations can be obtained as the variation of an energy functional .",
    "this energy is the sum of stretching and bending terms such that the ratio of bending to stretching energy scales like the thickness squared @xcite .",
    "consequently , thin plates energetically prefer to bend out of the plane rather than stretch ",
    "a phenomenon easily observed in stretched sheets @xcite  and this could be the mechanism used by growing sheets to buckle out of the plane .",
    "non - uniform growth is difficult to model using the fvk equations since it commonly generates structures with residual stresses @xcite and thus it is unclear what is an appropriate reference configuration from which strains can be measured .",
    "one technique for defining a reference configuration is to specify a two dimensional `` target metric '' @xmath5 on the mid - surface of the sheet from which strains are measured @xcite .",
    "the metric @xmath5 is a geometric quantity that locally determines all of the intrinsic properties of an abstract surface such as its gaussian curvature and geodesics @xcite .",
    "thus , we are naturally led to consider the problem of finding isometric immersions of @xmath5 into @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "but , the problem is that in general isometric immersions of @xmath5 may not exist or be unique and this model does not incorporate important three dimensional effects such as a mechanism for penalizing highly bent configurations .    instead of modeling non - uniform growth as isometric immersions , a ",
    "non- euclidean \" elastic energy functional has been recently introduced that incorporates @xmath5 and reduces to the fvk functional when @xmath5 is the identity matrix @xcite .",
    "this functional has the same energy scaling as fvk with the stretching energy measuring @xmath1 deviations of the immersion from @xmath5 . as with the fvk functional ,",
    "if the thickness is sufficiently small the stretching energy dominates and we expect the elastic sheet to bend out of the plane to match the metric . in particular , if @xmath2 isometric immersions exist then in the limit of vanishing thickness minimizers of the non - euclidean fvk functional converge to a minimizer of the bending energy over the class of @xmath2 isometric immersions of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus in this model the particular isometric immersion is selected by the bending energy .",
    "an alternative is to decompose the deformation of the sheet into a growth tensor and an elastic response , and define the elastic energy in these terms .",
    "lewicka , mahadevan and pakzad @xcite have shown that the two approaches are essentially equivalent in the limit that the thickness of the sheet vanishes .    in this paper",
    "we study isometric immersions of @xmath5 in the disk geometry when @xmath5 specifies a constant negative gaussian curvature @xmath6 .",
    "experimentally , disks of constant negative curvature obtain an equilibrium configuration with a periodic profile of one wavelength with the number of nodes increasing with decreasing thickness @xcite .",
    "consequently , we will look for low bending energy test functions that match the target metric and have a periodic profile .",
    "finding such test functions corresponds to the classical problem of finding isometric immersions of the hyperbolic plane @xmath3 into @xmath0 .",
    "hilbert @xcite proved that there are no real analytic isometric immersions of the entire hyperbolic plane into @xmath0 , but this does not exclude the possibility of the existence of isometric immersions with weaker smoothness criteria .",
    "in fact , the nash - kuiper theorem states that through the technique of convex integration there exists @xmath7 isometric immersions of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "but , such an immersion would be too rough since the bending energy requires the surface to be at least weakly second differentiable .",
    "furthermore , by efimov s theorem , we know that there are no @xmath8 isometric immersions of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the admissible surfaces with finite elastic fvk energy are @xmath2 and this motivates the search for @xmath2 isometric immersions which lie between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in smoothness .    in general finding an isometric immersion of an arbitrary metric is a non - trivial problem .",
    "but , by minding s theorem @xcite , which states that any two abstract surfaces having the same constant gaussian curvature are locally isometric , we can cut out subsets of surfaces of constant negative curvature which will be isometric to pieces of @xmath3",
    ". in particular , if @xmath9 is a surface of constant negative curvature and @xmath10 then @xmath11 is isometric to a disk of radius @xmath12 in @xmath3 , provided @xmath13 is smooth .",
    "furthermore , it was proven by amsler that the singularities where @xmath9 fails to be smooth form curves on @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these curves form a boundary beyond which no disks locally isometric to @xmath3 can be cut out of the surface .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the mathematical model for thin elastic sheets with a specified metric @xmath5 in the form of a variational problem with a fvk type functional .",
    "we show that for isometric immersions the functional reduces to the willmore functional and thus in the vanishing thickness limit if an isometric immersion exists the minimizing configurations should converge to a minimizer of the willmore energy over the class of @xmath2 isometric immersions @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : hyperbolic ] we review some of the theory of hyperbolic surfaces that will allow us to construct isometric immersions in @xmath0 . in particular , we make use of chebyshev nets ( c - nets ) which are local parameterizations of a surface whose coordinate curves form quadrilaterals on the surface with opposite sides having equal length @xcite .",
    "originally , chebyshev used c - nets to describe the arrangement of fibers in clothing and he showed that a sphere must be covered by at least two cuts of cloth @xcite ( see @xcite for a modern translation ) .",
    "as evidenced by the sphere , c - nets in general are only local parameterizations of a surface and a global c - net exists if the integral of the magnitude of the gaussian curvature over a quadrilateral is less than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "c - nets are useful parameterizations in that they lead to a natural way to discretize a surface @xcite and projections of c - nets onto paper retain the three dimensional properties of the surface @xcite .",
    "remarkably , for surfaces with constant negative curvature , every sufficiently smooth isometric immersion generates a c - net on the surface obtained by taking the asymptotic curves as the coordinate curves and conversely every c - net on a surface of constant negative curvature generates an immersion whose asymptotic curves are the coordinate lines @xcite .",
    "the extrinsic and intrinsic geometry of the particular immersion is entirely determined by the angle @xmath15 between the asymptotic curves and a parameterization is a c - net if and only if @xmath15 is a solution of the sine - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "thus , solutions of the sine - gordon equation generate surfaces of negative curvature and the corresponding immersion will fail to be smooth when @xmath15 is an integer multiple of @xmath16 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : pseudosphere ] we show that isometric immersions of geodesic discs in the hyperbolic plane can by constructed by cutting out subsets of a classical hyperbolic surface , the pseudosphere .",
    "this is contrary to the claims in @xcite where the experimentally observed buckling and refinement in wavelength with decreasing thickness is attributed to the non - existence of smooth isometric immersions .",
    "these configurations have very large bending energy even away from the singular curve and do not have the rotational @xmath17-fold symmetry observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "a natural question is the connection between this existence result and the non - existence result of holmgren @xcite stating that given a",
    " local \" immersion of an open set in @xmath3 into @xmath0 , there is a maximal domain of finite diameter on which this immersion can be extended to a smooth global immersion with one of the principal curvatures diverging as we approach the boundary . in sec .",
    "[ sec : minimax ] , we obtain a quantitative version of this result , by showing numerically that for isometric immersions of a hyperbolic disk of radius @xmath12 the ( nondimensional ) maximum principal curvature of the immersion is bounded from below by a bound which grows exponentially in the ( nondimensional ) radius . we also identify the surfaces which realize this bound , and they turn out to be disks cut from hyperboloids of revolution with constant negative curvature .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : small_slopes ] , we use the small slopes approximation to find approximate isometric immersions with a periodic profile .",
    "the small - slopes approximation has been widely used to model torn sheets and growing tissues @xcite . in this setting the problem of finding immersions of @xmath5",
    "reduces to solving a hyperbolic monge - ampere equation .",
    "the simplest solutions are a family of quadratic surfaces with two asymptotic lines intersecting at the origin .",
    "we then periodically extend the surface bounded between the two lines to construct periodic shapes that have the same scaling of amplitude versus period observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the two wave configuration is the global minimum of the bending energy over the class of isometric immersions and we prove that with decreasing thickness the configurations should converge to this shape .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : amsler ] we extend the surfaces constructed from solutions to the monge - ampere equation by studying hyperbolic surfaces with two asymptotic lines .",
    "these surfaces are called amsler surfaces , named after henri amsler who studied them in his paper on the nature of singularities of hyperbolic surfaces @xcite .",
    "amsler surfaces are generated by a similarity transformation of the sine - gordon equation which transforms it to a painlev iii equation in trigonometric form @xcite .",
    "from these surfaces , we can create periodic shapes as we did with the small slopes approximations that are energetically preferred over corresponding disks cut from the pseudosphere and hyperboloids .",
    "the bending energy of these surfaces is concentrated in small regions near the singular curves and the lines we are taking the periodic extension .",
    "furthermore for each @xmath18 , there is a radius @xmath19 such that the @xmath17-periodic amsler surfaces only exist for a radius @xmath20 .",
    "this gives a natural geometric mechanism for the refinement of the wavelength of the buckling pattern with increasing radius of the disk .",
    "finally , we present a concluding discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : discuss ] .",
    "we model the stress free configuration of a thin elastic disk of thickness @xmath21 and radius @xmath12 that has undergone differential growth as an abstract riemannian manifold @xmath22 with metric @xmath5 . more specifically , if we choose a coordinate system for @xmath22 so that @xmath23 lies at the center of the disk then @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the distance function induced by @xmath5 . a configuration of the sheet in three dimensions",
    "is then given by a mapping @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , the image of the mapping , is taken to be the mid - surface of a sheet .",
    "the equilibrium configurations of the sheet are extrema for the elastic energy functional : @xmath28=\\int_{d}\\|d\\mathbf{x}^t\\cdot d\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{g}\\|^2\\,da+t^2\\int_{d}\\|4h^2-k\\|^2\\,da,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the mean curvature of the surface @xmath13 , @xmath30 is the gaussian curvature , @xmath31 is the jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the area element on @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this functional is an asymptotic expression for a full three dimensional elastic energy functional per unit thickness @xcite . the first integral measures the stretching energy and vanishes when @xmath32 is an isometric immersion while the second integral measures bending energy and vanishes when the image of @xmath32 is a plane .",
    "this functional is a fvk type since it is the sum of stretching and bending energies such that ratio of bending to stretching energy scales like @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 is not euclidean , i.e. if the gaussian curvature corresponding to @xmath5 is non - zero , then both of these terms can not simultaneously vanish in three dimensions and consequently the equilibrium configuration will not be able to reduce all of its elastic energy even in the absence of external forces .    in this paper we will focus on ( [ energy ] ) when @xmath5 generates a constant negative gaussian curvature @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath6 is the _ target gaussian curvature _ , and we can always nondimensionalize such that @xmath36 , _ i.e. _ , we chose the units for length as @xmath37 .",
    "if the surface is ( initially ) parameterized by @xmath38 then @xmath39 , @xmath40 , are the dimensionless parameterization variables and @xmath41 is the dimensionless radius .",
    "therefore , if we can find a configuration @xmath32 such that @xmath42 then , the gaussian curvature of the immersion @xmath43 and ( [ energy ] ) reduces to the following equivalent elastic energy functional @xmath44=\\int_d(k_1 ^ 2+k_2 ^ 2)\\,da,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the principal curvatures of @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath47 , this energy is equivalent to the willmore energy @xcite",
    ". we will refer to @xmath48 as the ( normalized ) _ bending energy _ of the configuration @xmath32 , although , strictly speaking , the bending energy is the quantity @xmath49 and not the quantity @xmath48 itself .",
    "since we are integrating over a geodesic circle it is convenient to work in geodesic polar coordinates , which are the natural analogs of the radial and polar angle coordinates on a riemannian manifold @xcite . in these",
    "coordinates @xmath13 is parameterized by the coordinates @xmath50 which map to a point @xmath51 satisfying @xmath52 and @xmath53 lies on a geodesic whose initial velocity vector makes an angle @xmath54 with respect to a basis of the tangent plane at @xmath55 . in this coordinate system the metric @xmath5 has components @xmath56 and equation ( [ bending - energy - general ] ) takes the form : @xmath57=\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^r \\sinh(r)(k_1 ^ 2+k_2 ^ 2)\\,dr\\,d\\psi.\\ ] ]    lewicka and pakzad @xcite have shown that , for immersions @xmath32 in the space @xmath58 , @xmath59 = \\begin{cases }   \\mathcal{b}[\\mathbf{x } ] , & d\\mathbf{x}^t\\cdot d\\mathbf{x } = \\mathbf{g } \\\\ + \\infty , & \\mbox{otherwise } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 implies that @xmath32 is an isometric immersion .",

    "by minding s theorem @xcite as long as @xmath13 is smooth it can form an isometric immersion of @xmath22 . to construct @xmath13",

    "an asymptotic curve is a curve in @xmath9 whose normal curvature vanishes everywhere .",
    "moreover , since the principal curvatures @xmath45 and @xmath46 of a hyperbolic surface have opposite signs it follows that through each point @xmath66 there are exactly two asymptotic curves that intersect at @xmath55 .",

    "free non - euclidean thin elastic sheets arise in a variety of physical @xcite and biological @xcite systems .",

    "one approach is to model the sheet as an abstract manifold with a prescribed _ target metric _",
    "@xmath5 , which is then used to define strains and hence an elastic energy for a configuration .    in this paper",
    "we considered the geometric problem of immersing disks with _ constant negative curvature _ into @xmath0 .",
    "there are two settings for this problem which are relevant .",
    "one is the problem of  exact \" isometric immersions @xmath476 where @xmath63 is the configuration of the center surface .",
    "the other problem is a small - slopes approximation with an in and out of plane decomposition , @xmath477 with the isometric immersions given by @xmath478    in the small slopes approximation , we proved that global minimizers of the bending energy over solutions of ( [ eq : lnrzd ] ) are given by a quadratic saddle @xmath321 .",
    "we thus expect that , with decreasing thickness , the configuration of the sheet will converge to a two wave solution .",
    "this is not what is observed experimentally , where the number of waves increases with decreasing thickness @xcite .",
    "consequently , the physically realized configurations _ are not _ given by the global minimizers of the model energy .",
    "note however , that the periodic , non - smooth profiles that we construct in sec .",
    "[ sec : small_slopes ] do agree qualitatively , and in scaling behavior , with the experimental observations .",
    "this is a puzzle , since these periodic , non - smooth profiles _ are not _ global minimizers of the energy , and we need a different selection mechanism if these profiles do indeed represent the experimental configurations .    one way to improve the modeling of the system is to consider the  full \" fppl  von krmn energy ( [ energy ] ) and the associated isometric immersions given by ( [ eq : exact ] ) . for complete surfaces of constant negative curvature ( or surfaces",
    "whose curvature is bounded above by a negative constant ) , hilbert s theorem @xcite ( resp .",

    "these results are sometimes used as a basis for physical intuition that there are no ",
    "global \" isometric immersions of constant negative curvature surfaces , and this leads to the observed refinement of wavelength with decreasing thickness @xcite .",
    "we investigated this problem and showed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pseudosphere ] and  [ sec : minimax ] ) there exists smooth isometric immersions @xmath479 for geodesic disks of arbitrarily large radius @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , in elucidating the connection between this existence result and the non - existence results above , we provided numerical evidence that the maximum principal curvature of such immersions is bounded below by a bound which grows exponentially in @xmath123 .",
    "the existence of smooth , and thus also @xmath2 immersions of arbitrarily large disks have consequences for the modeling of free non - euclidean sheets .",
    "in particular , the minimizers of the elastic energy ( [ energy ] ) must converge as @xmath480 to a minimizer of ( [ bending - energy - general ] ) @xcite , and the energy of the minimizer @xmath481 is bounded from above by @xmath482 \\leq t^2 \\inf_{\\mathbf{y}\\in \\mathcal{a}}\\mathcal{b}[\\mathbf{y}]\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the set of all the @xmath2 solutions of ( [ eq : exact ] ) .",

    "this is an apparent contradiction with experimental observations where the bending energy of the minimizer scales with the thickness @xmath21 and is well fit by a power law , @xmath485 , which diverges as @xmath325 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that further improvements of the modeling might be necessary for a quantitative description of the experimental phenomena .",
    "the smooth immersions @xmath479 ( secs .",
    "[ sec : pseudosphere ]  and  [ sec : minimax ] ) do not have the rotational @xmath17-fold symmetry ( @xmath486 for the geodesic polar angle @xmath54 ) of the underlying energy functional , which is also seen in the experimentally observed configurations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : amsler ] we generalize the construction of the non - smooth , @xmath17-wave small - slopes solutions to obtain isometric immersions ( solutions of ( [ eq : exact ] ) ) which are also non - smooth and have the same symmetry / morphology as the experimentally observed configurations .",
    "these periodic amsler surfaces _ have lower bending energy _ than the smooth immersions given by subsets of the pseudosphere and hyperboloids with constant negative curvature .    for each @xmath487",
    ", there is a radius @xmath488 such that the @xmath17-periodic amsler surfaces only exist for a radius @xmath489 .",
    "this gives a natural mechanism for the refinement of the wavelength of the buckling pattern with increasing radius of the disk .",
    "however , it does not , at least directly , explain the observed refinement with decreasing thickness .",
    "we have considered the purely geometric model which arises as a limit @xmath480 .",
    "a natural question is the applicability if our results for physical sheets where @xmath322 .",
    "perhaps the refinement of the wavelength with decreasing @xmath21 is an effect which can only be captured by studying the full fppl  von krmn energy ( [ energy ] ) . for @xmath322",
    ", we expect that the minimizers of the energy will have boundary layers near the edge of the disk and also near the singular asymptotic lines , so that the disks satisfy stress and moment balance everywhere .",
    "the boundary layers near the outer edge of the disk may then set the wavelength throughout the disk .",
    "a similar phenomenon in stretched elastic sheets was studied in this manner in @xcite .",
    "the buckling patterns in non - euclidean sheets are the result of dynamical ( albeit slow ) processes , and it may be more appropriate to model this type of differential growth dynamically , perhaps as a gradient flow for the elastic energy . the pattern is then selected for dynamical reasons ( fastest growth rate , etc . ) and not by global minimization of an energy functional",
    "this might explain why local but not global extrema for the energy functional seem to describe the observed patterns .",
    "however , neither the boundary layers , nor the gradient flow dynamics , can explain how the refinement with decreasing thickness can lead to an apparent divergence of the the bending energy @xmath62",

    "this suggests the need for better models that are carefully validated by comparison with experiments in order to obtain a quantitative description of non - euclidean free sheets .      1 .   in sec .",
    "[ sec : minimax ] , we use an _ ansatz _ motivated by numerical experiments to show that the solutions to the minimax problem @xmath490 are given by disks cut out of constant curvature hyperboloids of revolution , where the admissible set @xmath61 consists of all @xmath8 or smoother isometric embeddings .",
    "we are working on a rigorous ( ansatz free ) proof of this result .",
    "2 .   our lower bound for the maximum principal curvature ( and hence the maximum bending energy density ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : minimax ] can be interpreted as a lower bound on the @xmath491 norm of the bending energy density @xmath492 over the admissible set , which consists of isometric immersions . the limiting energy and configuration of the non - euclidean sheet as @xmath480",
    "is given by the lower bound for the @xmath493 norm of the bending energy density .",
    "motivated by this observation , we are investigating lower bounds for the @xmath138 norms @xmath155 to connect the known case @xmath494 with the case of interest @xmath495 .",
    "chebyshev nets give a natural discretization of surfaces with constant negative curvature that respects both the intrinsic and the extrinsic geometry of the surface .",
    "this idea has already been used for constructing discrete isometric immersions ( @xmath30-surfaces ) for such surfaces @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as a @xmath480 limit for the variational problem ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we are developing numerical methods for the variational problem given by ( [ energy ] ) with @xmath484 that exploits the chebyshev net structure .",
    "our results strongly use the fact that the target metric on the surface has constant negative curvature , which then allows us to naturally associate a chebyshev net with each isometric immersion through an asymptotic parameterization @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that our results , in particular the lower bound for the maximum principal curvature ( [ eq : sclng ] ) , and the construction of @xmath496 and piecewise smooth isometric immersions can also be extended to other target metrics whose curvature is bounded above by a negative constant .",

    "this suggests the following natural questions : are there non - smooth immersions ( @xmath496 or even @xmath2 immersions ) with multiple bifurcation points ? + the geometry of such surfaces will then serve as a model for the observed morphology in many non - euclidean sheets including torn plastic @xcite and lettuce leaves @xcite which do not have a globally defined number of waves , but rather have local buckling behavior which increases the number of waves as we approach the boundary .",
