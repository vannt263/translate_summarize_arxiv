    "there is a general consensus that the intracluster medium ( icm ) in low - entropy galaxy cluster cores is able to remain in rough _ global _ thermal equilibrium because the powerful jets from the central agn inject sufficient energy to compensate for radiative losses ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "there are , however , a number of key issues associated with this  radio feedback \" schema that have yet to be firmly pinned down , one of which is : how is the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) able to transport sufficient energy to the cluster core ( @xmath1 10s of kpc ) at a timescale shorter than the core cooling time ( @xmath2 gyr ) .",
    "there are two scenarios proposed for agn feedback : ( 1 ) hot / bondi accretion which invokes spherical accretion with the mass flow rate set by the hot gas density and temperature on the cluster core scales ; and ( 2 ) the competing cold mode accretion model , in which a fraction of the gas in the cluster cores condenses into cold clouds and filaments ( when the ratio of the cooling time to the free - fall time [ @xmath3 falls below a threshold value in the range 5 - 20 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , which then decouple from surrounding hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , rain down upon the central smbh , and power agn feedback strong enough to prevent catastrophic cooling in the core .    of the two , the bondi accretion model , though more frequently invoked in the literature , has a number of shortcomings .",
    "for one , bondi accretion is only applicable if the accretion flow is spherically symmetric and single phase , both conditions that are at odds with the multiphase gas with angular momentum observed in several cool cores ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , for a polytropic hot flow @xmath4 , the mass accretion rate is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath5 where @xmath6^{1/2}$ ] is the sound speed in the ambient medium far from the black hole ; the mean particle mass @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath9 ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the ambient particle number density and temperature scaled to @xmath12 @xmath13 and 1 kev , respectively ; and since @xmath14 varies weakly with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 varies from 1/4 for @xmath17 to 1.1 for @xmath18 ) we adopt @xmath19 for convenience . in three nearby systems where both the ambient conditions governing the bondi flow rate and the mass accretion rate onto the black hole can be deduced ,",
    "the former is at least two orders of magnitude too large .",
    "these nearby examples are sgr a * , the galactic center bh [ bondi rate of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) vs. the accretion rate at @xmath21 of @xmath22 ( @xcite and references therein ) ] ; ngc 3115 [ bondi rate of @xmath23 vs. the accretion rate onto the bh at least two orders of magnitude smaller ( @xcite ) ] ; and m87 [ bondi rate of @xmath24 @xmath25 vs. the accretion rate onto the bh of @xmath26 ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "@xcite find that the median efficiency ( defined as the ratio of the observed jet power and @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the smbh accretion rate ) required to supply the cavity power of nearby radio galaxies is 300% , assuming @xmath29 typical of similar nearby hot accretion flows .",
    "this implies that hot accretion , with reasonable assumptions , is insufficient for powering most of the cavities observed in cluster cores . at the extreme end of the spectrum , the estimated jet / cavity power in some of the galaxy clusters ( e.g. , ms0735 , cen a )",
    "is found to be much larger than @xmath30 ; i.e. , the bondi mass flow rate is insufficient to power the observed x - ray cavities _ even if all the hot gas in the bondi flow is accreted by the smbh _ ( @xcite ) . and",
    "finally , the accretion rate in the bondi regime takes a long time to adjust to the conditions ( @xmath31 ) changing in the cluster cores ( @xmath32 kpc ) at the core cooling timescale @xmath1 few 100 myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the cold mode feedback model sidesteps many of the challenges associated with the hot / bondi model . very briefly",
    "( we refer the readers to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite [ hereafter ] for a more expansive discussion ) , the model is based on the realization that even if the icm in the cluster core exists in rough global thermal balance , if the ratio of the cooling time and the gravitational free - fall time ( @xmath33 ) falls below a critical value ( @xmath34 or so ; @xcite ) , the gas will become susceptible to local thermal instabilities and fragment , leading to the formation of a multiphase medium consisting of cold dense clouds condensing from the hot diffuse icm itself .",
    "the clouds then fall towards central agn , resulting in increased smbh accretion and feedback that , in turn , quenches runaway cooling in the cluster core .",
    "the main question with this model is : will the infalling cold gas , which has non - zero angular momentum , end up forming a standard viscosity - mediated accretion flow ( saf ) in which the gas will flow inwards on a ( long ) viscous accretion timescale , or will the gas circularize sufficiently close to the smbh and accrete on a timescale shorter than the core cooling time . in this paper",
    ", we use 3-d hydrodynamic simulations of agn jets interacting with the icm to investigate this problem .",

    "we show that the angular momentum distribution of cold gas crossing @xmath32 kpc is close to isotropic which will lead to angular momentum cancellation and the formation of a compact accretion flow .",

    "the three runs are : ( i ) an initially hydrostatic icm in a fixed nfw potential ( this is the fiducial run in with the halo mass of @xmath49 ) ; ( ii ) the same run but with the inner and outer radii reduced by half ; ( iii ) and a nfw+bcg ( the latter is modeled as a singular isothermal potential with circular velocity @xmath50 km s@xmath51 ) potential run .",
    "the nfw+bcg run is carried out with pluto ( @xcite ) code , whereas the nfw runs are done with zeus - mp ( @xcite ) .",
    "roughly similar results are obtained with the two codes .",
    "the initial entropy profile for both nfw and nfw+bcg runs are identical ( see eq . 7 in ) .",
    "the initial icm density for the nfw+bcg run is almost twice of the nfw runs ( which have identical initial density profiles ) .",
    "the different runs have different inner ( @xmath39 ) and outer ( @xmath52 ) radial boundaries ( see table [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the density and pressure at the outer radial boundary is fixed to their initial values .",
    "the total mass ( including both hot and cold phases ) crossing the inner boundary is calculated ( @xmath46 ) , and a fraction @xmath53 of @xmath54 is put back into the icm in the form of kinetic power ( @xmath55 ) of agn jets .",
    "all our runs behave in a very similar manner .",
    "there are cooling and heating cycles , and the feedback driven heating events are less frequent for a higher feedback efficiency .",
    "although the feedback efficiency , @xmath53 , is ten times higher for the nfw+bcg run , because of a deeper potential well at the center ( due to the bcg contribution ) , its behavior is similar to the fiducial nfw run .",
    "the nfw run with @xmath56 kpc uses the same efficiency parameter ( @xmath53 ) as the fiducial run with @xmath57 kpc .",
    "however , because of a smaller inner radius and non - zero angular momentum of the condensing gas , the mass accretion rate across the inner boundary is lower as some of the gas circularizes at @xmath58 kpc .",
    "consequently , the feedback energy input is smaller and the run shows a higher accumulation of cold gas in the central regions ( see @xmath42 in table [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "density and temperature profiles , and other x - ray and jet properties are discussed in detail in , and will not be repeated in this paper . here",
    "we focus on the angular momentum distribution of cold gas in our simulations and the plausibility of stochastic accretion onto smbhs ( section [ sec : ang_mom ] ) , and comparison of simulation results with observations ( section [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "our simulations , like @xcite , use the total ( dominated by cold gas ) accretion rate at @xmath32 kpc to estimate the feedback energy deposited by jets .",
    "one of the major open problems with cold mode feedback is : how does the cold gas originating at @xmath59 kpc lose angular momentum and get rapidly accreted onto the smbh .",
    "this is needed for feedback to prevent a cooling flow .",
    "although it is numerically formidable to resolve both the cluster core and accretion flow onto the smbh , we attempt to estimate the accretion rate onto the smbh based on the angular momentum distribution of cold gas within our simulation domain . while the large angular momentum gas forms a massive disk at @xmath59 kpc , the smaller angular momentum gas crossing the inner boundary has stochastic angular momentum changing over short timescales . rapid angular momentum cancellation in this stochastic cold gas can allow substantial cold gas to be channeled to the smbh sufficiently fast to prevent a cooling flow ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .      in this section",
    "we review the standard accretion physics that we apply later to estimate the accretion rate onto the smbh ( section [ sec : saf ] ) . for a given specific angular momentum ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "the circularization radius of the gas is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass enclosed ( including only smbh + dark matter contributions ; i.e. , ignoring gas mass ) within the circularization radius . the viscous accretion time at the circularization radius can be expressed in terms of the specific angular momentum , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the angular velocity , @xmath65 is the viscosity parameter ( @xcite ) , and @xmath66 is the ratio of the disk height and radius .",
    "we scale the numerical values using @xmath67 .",
    "this is consistent with results from mhd simulations of magnetized accretion flows , which find that the effective value of @xmath65 is 0.1 over the bulk of the flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the realistic @xmath66 for standard agn disks is @xmath68 ( e.g. , see eq . 6 in @xcite ) , we scale our results to @xmath69 because the standard choice gives a very small smbh accretion rate .",

    "go onto argue that even in the higher @xmath197 regime , sca is responsible for the emergence of the smbh @xmath198 relation because accretion via a standard extended disk results in more massive smbhs than observed since a massive extended thin disk does not couple efficiently to an isotropic feedback - powered outflow .",
    "turbulence due to stochastic angular momentum and infall of cold gas ( viscous time is much shorter for a turbulent flow with @xmath199 ) also prevents the problem of gravitational fragmentation in stochastic accretion flow .",
    "most of the earlier studies of stochastic cold accretion were carried out in idealized numerical setups with turbulence in the cold gas driven artificially ( to realize the stochastic distribution of cold gas angular momentum ) .",
    "we analyze the angular momentum distribution of cold gas in our agn jet - icm simulations ( which appear consistent with most observations of cool cluster cores ; see section [ sec : obs ] ) and demonstrate that stochastic cold accretion is indeed realized in cool cluster cores stirred by time - dependent agn jets . in cluster simulations with limited resolution , the accretion physics input has to necessarily go in the form of a sub - grid model .",
    "one such model , which is much better than what is typically used ( including ours in this paper where we estimate @xmath197 at @xmath32 kpc and multiply it by an efficiency parameter @xmath53 to calculate the mechanical power injected by the smbh ) , is to use the mass accretion rate of the low angular momentum gas ( with say @xmath153 @xmath75s@xmath51 ; see eq .",

    "another improvement is the inclusion of star formation and realistic stellar feedback ( stellar feedback is increasingly important for lower mass halos such as clusters and elliptical galaxies ; e.g. , see fig . 4 in @xcite ) that can prevent artificial accumulation of massive cold gas in cluster cores ( e.g. , as done by @xcite ) . also , as mentioned earlier , our choice of @xmath53 ( feedback efficiency parameter ) is on the lower side , resulting in somewhat large mass deposition and star formation in the core .",
    "more 3-d simulations with larger @xmath53s are required to get a complete picture .",
    "much more needs to be done in understanding the details of stochastic cold accretion ( sca ) . in our simulations , which focus on larger ( @xmath59 kpc ) scales",

    "in particular , we need to understand how the stochastic cold gas condensing out of the icm is eventually accreted onto the smbh . whether a disk forms after the cancellation of stochastic angular momentum and on what timescale , and at what radii does the transition from sca to a viscous thin disk ( if it does at all ) and to a riaf ( radiatively inefficient accretion flow ) occurs . while the transition radius from a thin disk to an inner hot / thick riaf occurs at a smaller radius for a higher accretion rate , the details are not clear even for the standard ( non - stochastic ) accretion flows with a fixed angular momentum axis ( e.g. , see the vastly different estimates of disk to riaf transition radius in @xcite [ fig .",
    "9b ] , @xcite [ fig . 1 ] , @xcite [ fig .",
    "7b ] ) .    strong agn jets and x - ray cavities ( which are powered by jets ) are expected only in the radiatively inefficient accretion regime for which @xmath200 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our smbh accretion rate at most times is lower than this threshold for jet formation ( see fig . [",

    "infrequent , short duration high @xmath28 events , in fact , provide a basis for changing the direction of the jet , as observed in numerous clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . generally the mass accretion rate onto the smbh is expected to be even lower because of outflows in riafs ( larger suppression is expected for bigger riafs ) .",
    "therefore , advances in accretion physics are required to estimate the size of riafs and the mass accretion rate onto smbhs fed by sca . to sum up , majority of the cold gas condensing out of the icm due to thermal instability has large angular momentum such that the viscous accretion timescale is longer than the core cooling time for @xmath201 @xmath75s@xmath51 ( eq . [ eq : tvisc ] ) .",
    "most of this gas is expected to be toomre unstable and to form stars , instead of being accreted onto the smbh .",
    "the lower angular momentum cold gas ( @xmath153 @xmath75s@xmath51 ) has stochastic angular momentum and cloud collisions ( which lead to rapid angular momentum cancellation ) cause the cold , turbulent gas to be accreted rapidly , without much gravitational fragmentation . at innermost radii",
    "typically a riaf with powerful jets is expected , since @xmath202 .",
    "we finally summarize our major findings in the following points :    * stochastic cold accretion ( sca ) , which was anticipated to play a key role in accretion onto smbhs from idealized simulations , is realized naturally in our realistic agn jet - icm simulations due to the turbulence induced by jets in a non - uniform icm . *",
    "we find that the low angular momentum cold gas ( @xmath112 @xmath75s@xmath51 ) condensing out of the icm has an isotropic distribution of angular momentum , which we expect will result in the cancellation of angular momentum on almost a dynamical time .",
    "this is unlike a standard viscosity - mediated accretion flow , in which an extended thin disk with a long accretion time is expected to form .",
    "another advantage of a stochastic accretion flow is that the net angular momentum of the low angular momentum cold gas varies on a timescale shorter than the core cooling time , implying that angular momentum cancellation and feedback driven by cold gas accretion can respond fast enough . *",
    "our work suggests an improved feedback prescription based on the angular momentum distribution of cold gas ( section [ sec : improv ] ) , which may be more robust than the usual models in which the mass accretion rate is estimated at @xmath1 kpc scales . in the latter approach one has to fine tune the feedback efficiency parameter ( @xmath53 ) for different radii at which the mass accretion rate is estimated ( compare our nfw runs with the inner radius of 1 and 0.5 kpc ) . * most of the features of cold accretion simulations , which show multiphase cooling and heating cycles driven by accretion of cold gas , match observations such as a large scatter of cold gas mass when compared to the smbh and halo masses ( this is not expected for hot / bondi accretion ) . a large scatter observed between bondi power and jet /",

    "<S> several arguments suggest that stochastic condensation of cold gas and its accretion onto the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is essential for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback to work in the most massive galaxies that lie at the centers of galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our 3-d agn jet - icm ( intracluster medium ) simulations show that the angular momentum of the cold gas crossing @xmath0 kpc is essentially isotropic . with almost equal mass in clockwise and counter - clockwise orientations </S>",
    "<S> , we expect a cancellation of angular momentum on roughly the dynamical time . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a compact accretion flow with a short viscous time ought to form , through which enough accretion power can be channeled into jet mechanical energy sufficiently quickly to prevent a cooling flow . </S>",
    "<S> the inherent stochasticity , expected in feedback cycles driven by cold gas condensation , gives rise to a large variation in the cold gas mass at the centers of galaxy clusters , for similar cluster and smbh masses , in agreement with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> such correlations are expected to be much tighter for the smoother hot / bondi accretion . </S>",
    "<S> the weak correlation between cavity power and bondi power obtained from our simulations also match observations .    </S>",
