    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are luminous events that synthesize an appreciable fraction of the iron - peak elements in the universe ( iwamoto et al . 1999 ) , and their high and relatively homogeneous peak luminosities have allowed them to be utilized to measure large distances . sn ia distance estimates have revealed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "there is considerable interest in extending the current utilization of sne ia , both by better understanding the sn ia event and by widening the rest - frame wavelength range which can be utilized .",
    "the ultraviolet wavelength ( uv ) range , including the range covered by the @xmath5-band , bears tremendous potential towards the better understanding of sne ia , but it also poses significant challenges . , nuv to be emission between the 2500  4000@xmath3 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 filters ) and muv to be emission between 1500  2500@xmath3 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters ) . ]",
    "theoretically , the uv wavelength range is useful to better understand the explosive nucleosynthesis of the sn event .",
    "iron - peak elements strongly affect this wavelength range through the related effects of line - blanketing and line - blocking ( jeffery et al .",
    "sauer et al .",
    "2008 , hachinger et al .",
    "in particular , observations made at early epochs are a sensitive probe of the composition of the outer layers of the sn ejecta .",
    "this is important for the determination of the progression of the burning front through the outer layers of the ejecta during a suggested delayed detonation phase .",
    "the flux in the uv part of the spectrum of a sn ia is shaped mostly by metal lines , in particular feii and iii , tiii , crii , coii and niii , with contributions from siii and mgii .",
    "these ions have a large number of strong as well as weak lines in the uv .",
    "uv photons are actively absorbed in these lines , and because of the high velocity of the sn ejecta the forest of lines becomes a  blanket \" : different lines in different parts of the ejecta overlap because of velocity shear , leading to the effective blocking of the flux .",
    "once photons are absorbed , they are most likely to escape only if they are re - emitted in red transitions , as at red ( optical ) wavelengths the total line opacity is much less .",
    "since metal line opacity is quite high , the uv spectra are therefore good tracers of metal abundance in the outer layers of the ejecta , and different temperatures or abundance ratios can lead to different uv colours ( e.g. walker et al 2012 ) . on the other hand , in the outermost layers , uv opacity may not be so high because the density is low . in this case",
    "the strongest metal lines are the only active ones .",
    "these are typically in the optical .",
    "it is therefore possible for optical photons to be absorbed and re - emitted in the uv in a process called reverse fluorescence . because of the low uv opacity in these outermost layers , reverse fluoresced photons are essential in determining the emerging uv spectrum ( e.g. mazzali 2000 ) .",
    "hence , observations made in the uv combined with knowledge of the velocity of the expansion of the ejecta from spectra , permit detailed probing of the radiation transport on the sn ejecta .",
    "cosmologically , the wavelength range covered by the @xmath5-band is potentially useful for distance studies .",
    "extending a ground - based study of high redshift sne ia beyond z@xmath100.5 requires either observations made in observer - frame nir ( rest - frame optical ) , or in the observer - frame optical ( rest - frame uv ) . to explore the potential of the @xmath5-band , ground - based sn surveys have included @xmath5-band photometry in their recent campaigns of low - redshift sne .",
    "these campaigns have reported that there is considerable scatter in the photometry , at a level that exceeds what is seen in the optical filters .",
    "this scatter persists after all efforts to account for observational issues .",
    "jha , riess & kirshner ( 2007 ) presented @xmath11 light curves of 44 sne ia , but found that their multi - light curve fitting algorithm had lower overall scatter without including the @xmath5-band , than it did with the @xmath5-band .    one critical element for sn ia cosmology is to determine whether sn ia emission evolves with redshift .",
    "thought to be the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( hereafter co wd ) that accretes material from a companion , evolution of emission might be caused by metallicity , differences between low and high redshift progenitor co wds or by different companions to the co wd between low and high redshift binary systems .",
    "since modeling suggests that the uv wavelength range is a sensitive probe of the nucleosynthetic products of the sn explosion ( i.e. the composition of the ejecta , sauer et al .",
    "2008 ; lentz et al .",
    "2000 ) , a number of recent studies have compared rest - frame uv emission from multiple sne ia , trying to quantify the variations between events .",
    "the rest - frame uv emission for low-@xmath12 samples have been obtained from sn ia observations made with iue ( capellaro et al .",
    "1995 , panagia et al .",
    "2003 ) , from observations made with hst ( jeffery et al .",
    "1992 , see foley , filippenko & jha 2008 for a listing of all iue / hst uv spectra through 2007 ) , from high-@xmath12 samples with keck ( ellis et al .",
    "2008 , foley et al .",
    "2012c ) , or from hst observations of recent sne ia detected at very early epochs by the palomar transient factory ( cooke et al .",

    "2012b , 2011by : foley & kirshner 2013 ) .",
    "these studies have reported some differences between the uv emission from high-@xmath12 versus low-@xmath12 samples , and that the variations seen in the uv wavelength range within a sample exceeds the variations seen in the optical wavelength range . combined with the difficulties experienced with the ground - based @xmath5-band sn  ia light curve surveys ,",
    "the uv wavelength range has been considered a problematic wavelength range for cosmological studies .",
    "the uvot instrument ( roming et al .",
    "2000 , 2005 ) on the _ swift _ mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) possesses the ability to quickly schedule observations of a new supernova , increasing the chances of observing the important early epochs , prior to peak light .",
    "the 30 cm uvot instrument employs 3 uv filters ( @xmath13 ) and three optical filters ( @xmath14 ) , and sne are typically observed with all six filters at all epochs .",
    "the transmission curves for each filter are shown in figure 1 , folded through three uv / optical spectra of sne  ia .",
    "brown et al . ( 2009 ) presented photometry from the first 2.5 years of uvot observations , 2133 total observations of 25 sne , of which 17 are sne ia .",
    "whereas hst cameras have the advantage of superior s / n photometry and spectroscopy for the sne ia that are observed , the advantage for uvot observations are superior sampling of sne ia , both in number of events and in the number of observations for a single event .",
    "the photometry presented in brown et al .",
    "( 2009 ) was studied for light curve properties in milne et al .",
    "2010 ( hereafter m10 ) and for absolute magnitudes in brown et al .",
    "2010 ( hereafter b10 ) .",
    "m10 identified uv - optical color differences between the group of normal sne  ia and the groups of subluminous and sn 2002cx - like sne ia .",
    "the definition of normal used in m10 , which is the same definition that will be used in this work , is a sn ia with a b - band peak decline rate less than 1.6 ( e.g. @xmath15 @xmath16 1.6 ) , and not exhibiting optical spectral features similar to sn  2002cx .",
    "this group comprises the majority of sne ia , and is generally the group utilized for cosmological distance studies . within this group of normal sne ia ,",
    "the findings of m10 and b10 have not wholly matched the trends derived from ground - based optical and @xmath5-band surveys , nor the intepretations of the hst and iue uv spectra , as the initial sample of uvot uv light curves appeared more homogeneous than expected .",
    "if the uv light curves are intrinsically homogeneous , or , barring that , can be organized into distinct groups and exhibit low intrinsic scatter within those groups , the uv wavelength range would prove useful for cosmological applications .    in this work , we add two more years of sn ia uvot observations , to the m10/b10 collection , showing how the larger sample permits a better understanding of the range of uv light curves possible within the group of normal sne  ia ( section 2 ) .",
    "we present a more quantitative investigation into the color evolution of sub - classes we recognize within  normal \" sne  ia .",
    "we will not present color curves for subluminous sne ia , as those will be presented in a separate work ( milne et al .",

    "] there was a lone significant outlier to that trend , sn  2008q , which followed the same color - curve shape but was bluer at all early epochs than the other normal sne ia , seemingly offset from the other normal events .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the light curve peaks of the uvot-@xmath6 light curves were able to be fit with a linear luminosity - width relation ( lwr ) .",

    "see b10 for details of the method used to try to account for contamination of those filters from longer wavelength emission .",
    "] however , the peak pseudocolors were not correlated with peak - width for the nuv - optical colors , a finding different than what has been seen in the @xmath22 colors ( the phillips peak relation ; phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) , or in ground - based @xmath23 colors ( folatelli et al . 2010 ) .",
    "collectively , with the exception of sn  2008q , the uvot data - set of normal sne  ia suggested that there is a high level of homogeneity in the @xmath5-band wavelength range , but significant variations at shorter wavelengths .",
    "these findings are promising for the cosmological utilization of the nuv emission from sne  ia , as it suggests that the bright @xmath5 band can be successfully used to measure distances with low intrinsic scatter .",
    "these findings are also interesting for probing the explosion physics of sn ia events , as the dramatic color change with time and the intrinsic variations at the shorter wavelengths provide benchmarks for sn ia modeling .    since the b10 and m10 presentations of uvot sn ia photometry , the final photometric reductions for 11 more normal sne ia have been completed .",

    "that data was used , as the uvot optical data at peak suffered severe coincidence loss .",
    "sn  2011fe also suffered severe coincidence loss at optical peak , so @xmath18 and @xmath24 band data was used from richmond & smith ( 2012 ) .",
    "the reddening estimations are shown in table [ extinct ] , and are based upon the sum of the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) reddening and the host reddening .",
    "the mwg reddening was obtained from schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) via ned and the host reddening was obtained by the phillips peak pseudocolor relation ( phillips 1999 ) , the lira tail color relation ( lira 1995 ) and/or from ground - based studies of these sne ia , the host reddening being the remainder after subtracting mwg reddening . for the majority of this work ,",
    "the reddening estimates are used only for sample selection . in section 5 , the complications of treating extinction in light of newly recognized groupings is discussed .",
    "red - leak corrections , as explained in b10 , were not employed in this work .",
    "k - corrections are estimated using a collection of uv - optical spectra in appendix b , but were not employed for the color curves . the lack of uv spectra to provide adequate time coverage of all the major and minor groups that we have identified in this paper",
    "is the reason that neither correction is implemented for the color curves .",
    "the two filters that suffer the largest effect of red - leak , in terms of the fraction of photons estimated to originate from the wavelength range of the adjacent redder filter , are the @xmath7 and @xmath9 filters . as will be shown ,",
    "the color curves that include these filters are not simply tracings of the color curves from the adjacent redder filter .",
    "this suggests that the most red - leak affected filters still provide unique information about photons in their central wavelength range .",
    "nonetheless , readers are cautioned to avoid treating any of the filters as box functions about a central wavelength .",
