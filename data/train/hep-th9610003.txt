    "the ising model @xcite is , without doubt , one of the most frequently studied and best understood lattice models of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "although onsager s solution  @xcite of the two - dimensional ising model without external field dates back half a century already , no analytic solution of the 2d ising model in a magnetic field has been found .    however , the situation is somewhat different if considered from the viewpoint of field theory .",
    "the critical 2d ising model corresponds to the @xmath2 conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite of a massless majorana fermion .",
    "it was zamolodchikov  @xcite who noticed that a ( symmetry - breaking ) perturbation of this cft with the relevant spin density operator ( which has conformal dimensions @xmath3 ) preserves infinitely many conservation laws and therefore leads to an integrable quantum field theory .",
    "the corresponding minimal theory contains eight massive particles with factorized ( purely elastic ) scattering  @xcite ; the particle masses and the @xmath4-matrix elements are related to the exceptional lie algebra @xmath5 .",
    "this integrable field theory describes an appropriate scaling limit of the 2d ising model in a magnetic field .",
    "numerically , the predictions for the lowest mass ratios have been verified by several authors  @xcite .",
    "as these results rely on relatively small size transfer matrix calculations or on monte carlo simulations , they provide rather crude checks for the lowest mass ratios only .",
    "furthermore , the larger masses can not be obtained directly as these lie above the two - particle threshold of the lightest particles and hence are buried in the continuum of scattering states .",
    "however , one can extract indirect information about the higher masses and the scattering amplitudes from the finite - size behavior of the lower masses  @xcite .",
    "another , rather different , approach employs a truncated conformal hilbert space  @xcite , which however does not make the connection to the lattice model .",
    "similar theoretical and numerical investigations have also been performed for a variety of lattice models such as the quantum ising chain  @xcite , the lee - yang model  @xcite , the three - state potts model  @xcite , the tricritical ising respectively blume - capel model  @xcite , the ashkin - teller model  @xcite , the @xmath6 models  @xcite , and the integrable rsos models  @xcite .",
    "recently , this has been extended to the study of form factors and correlation functions  @xcite and non - integrable perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a new class of lattice models  @xcite which are solvable in the presence of a symmetry - breaking field  @xcite has changed the situation considerably .",
    "although we still can not solve the 2d ising model in a magnetic field , we now know a solvable model ( the so - called dilute @xmath0 model ) which belongs to the same universality class : it has a critical point of ising type  @xcite , and it is solvable in a symmetry - breaking field that corresponds to the spin density perturbation of the cft  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects this model to show the same properties in the scaling limit as the non - integrable ising model in a magnetic field .",
    "note , however , that the two models are rather different lattice models : the dilute @xmath0 model contains three local states , whereas the ising spins take two values only .    the dilute @xmath7 models are solvable by bethe ansatz ( ba ) @xcite . by a thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba )",
    "approach  @xcite , the mass ratios and @xmath4-matrix of the @xmath5 field theory have been obtained .",
    "however , this approach relies on assumptions on the nature of the ba solutions , which could not be substantiated by numerical solution of the ba equations ( bae ) at criticality .",
    "connections between the @xmath0 model and the exceptional lie algebra @xmath5 are also revealed by the existence of corresponding rogers - ramanujan identities  @xcite .    for our numerical investigation of the off - critical bae ,",
    "our main motivation was to check the assumptions on the conjectured string structure of the ba solutions .",
    "this could be achieved for the states with lowest masses , yielding at the same time very accurate numerical results not alone for the mass ratios , but also for the complete scaling functions .",
    "however , we also found _ one discrepancy _ with the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite . within the range of scaling parameter values considered , the characteristic string type for a particle of mass @xmath8 does not match the proposed structure .    as a by - product of our investigation",
    ", we found that the critical spectrum also contains _ massive _ excitations besides the well - known conformal spectrum .",
    "this is one property that distinguishes the dilute @xmath0 model from the ising model which does not have such excitations .",
    "however , this does not contradict universality as that only concerns the universal properties of the systems in the vicinity of the critical point , which are the same for both models .",
    "the ba solutions corresponding to the massive excitations show the same type of strings as those conjectured for the massive scaling limit .",
    "already for relatively small systems , these solutions lie very close to singularities of the bae , which makes the numerical treatment difficult .",
    "estimates of the corresponding mass ratios , which show no resemblance of the @xmath5 structure , are presented .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : a3 ] , the dilute @xmath0 models is introduced and the bae are presented . the critical spectrum predicted by cft and the behavior in the massive scaling limit are described .",
    "furthermore , the assumptions on the form of the ba solutions formulated in ref .  @xcite are summarized .",
    "section  [ s : nr ] contains the results of our numerical investigations . after a brief description of our numerical approach , we commence with the critical case , where not only the scaling dimensions predicted by cft are considered , but also additional massive excitations in the spectrum are identified .",
    "then , we show how the ba solutions behave as one goes away from criticality",
    ". finally , we present our numerical scaling functions for the lowest gaps and the numerical results for the mass ratios in the massive scaling limit .",
    "because an immediate specialization to the @xmath0 case does not considerably simplify the equations , we keep the first part of this section on a more general level and consider the dilute @xmath7 models .",
    "this also serves us to avoid an unnecessary repetition in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "the dilute @xmath7 models are irf ( interaction round a face ) models  @xcite of rsos ( restricted solid - on - solid ) type  @xcite on the square lattice with adjacency conditions encoded by the dynkin diagram of the lie algebra @xmath7 . in contrast to the usual ( non - dilute ) rsos models built on this adjacency graph ( these are the abf models @xcite )",
    ", the effective adjacency graph of the dilute @xmath7 models contains loops which connect each node to itself , see fig .",
    "[ f : ead ] . in other words",
    ", one considers configurations of @xmath9 local states or `` heights '' ( labeled @xmath10 ) on the vertices of the square lattice subject to the additional requirement that states on neighboring ( adjacent ) lattice sites may differ _ at most _ by one .",
    "one then defines a statistical model by assigning boltzmann weights to the elementary plaquettes ( faces ) of the lattice .",
    "the face weights of the dilute @xmath7 models are @xcite @xmath11 @xmath12 here , @xmath13 labels the heights , and the possible values of the variable @xmath14 are determined by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the crossing factors @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are standard theta functions of nome @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these face weights satisfy the yang - baxter equation and therefore lead to an integrable lattice model .",
    "the corresponding row transfer matrices  @xcite for fixed value of @xmath19 form a one - parameter commuting family in the spectral parameter @xmath21 .",
    "in general , the dilute @xmath7 models have four different branches for any value of @xmath9 @xcite , distinguished by two possible values of @xmath14 with two regimes each for the spectral parameter @xmath21 . here , we are only interested in the dilute @xmath0 model ( @xmath22 ) in a particular branch @xcite where the model behaves like the ising model in a magnetic field .",
    "for this case , @xmath23 and the spectral parameter @xmath21 lies in the interval @xmath24 .",
    "it is the parameter @xmath19 that acts like the magnetic field , and the ising critical point corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath26 of the row transfer matrix for a system of size @xmath27 with periodic boundary conditions have the following form  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and where the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , form a solution of the set of @xmath27 coupled bae @xmath32 here , @xmath33 labels a sector related to the braid limit eigenvalues of the row transfer matrix at criticality ( @xmath25 ) . whereas it is believed to be true that all eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are of the form ( [ e : eval ] ) , the converse is certainly wrong ( at least off - criticality )  the bae ( [ e : bae ] ) in general allow for many additional solutions which do not correspond to proper eigenvalues of the transfer matrix . for any numerically found solution of eq .",
    "( [ e : bae ] ) one thus has to check whether it gives a proper eigenvalue of the transfer matrix ( see section  [ s : nr ] below ) .",
    "the theta function @xmath17 shows the ( quasi-)periodicity properties @xcite    @xmath34    where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) with @xmath37 .",
    "consider a solution @xmath38 of the bae ( [ e : bae ] ) in sector @xmath39 . clearly , nothing is changed if a multiple of @xmath40 is added to any of the roots @xmath30 .",
    "more interesting is the result of adding @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) to a root @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", one obtains a solution of ( [ e : bae ] ) with @xmath43 replaced by @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ e : eval ] ) it is evident that these two solutions correspond to the same eigenvalue .",
    "this means that the `` sectors '' @xmath33 lose their significance in the off - critical case ( @xmath45 ) since we can always adjust @xmath39 by adding or subtracting suitable multiples of @xmath46 to some of the roots .",
    "of course , this also yields many possibilities in which the phase factors cancel , and hence eq .",
    "( [ e : bae ] ) is recovered without any alteration , which means that a single solution of the bae can be presented in many ways differing by addition and subtraction of suitable multiples of @xmath46 to some of the roots .    for the case of interest",
    ", it turns out that the largest eigenvalue @xmath47 of the transfer matrix is given by a purely imaginary solution of the bae ( [ e : bae ] ) in the sector @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , in place of the roots @xmath30 , we prefer to use @xmath49 in what follows ; thus the largest eigenvalue corresponds to a set of real ba roots @xmath50 .",
    "general solutions to the bae will however involve complex roots , which in the large @xmath27 limit typically arrange into so - called _ strings _ ( subsets of roots with approximately the same real part , in terms of the @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ f : string ] , where the horizontal line represents the real axis .",
    "note that the `` string content '' of a particular solution might well depend on the variable @xmath19 , an example of this behavior will be given in section  [ ss : bar ] below .",
    "the dilute @xmath0 model has a critical point of ising type at @xmath25 .",
    "thus its critical limit ( given by @xmath25 , @xmath51 ) is described by the @xmath2 cft with scaling dimensions @xmath52 .",
    "this has drastic consequences for the spectrum of the transfer matrix in the critical limit .",
    "consider the scaled spectral gaps @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix with periodic boundary conditions at the isotropic point @xmath55 , @xmath56 being the largest eigenvalue .",
    "in the critical limit , the spectrum of scaling dimensions @xmath57 consists of `` conformal towers '' of states labeled by pairs @xmath58 with scaled energy @xmath59 , conformal spin @xmath60 and momentum @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",

    "note that the face weights ( [ e : fw ] ) for nome @xmath19 and @xmath77 are related by symmetry , thus it suffices to consider positive values of the nome .    in the massive limit ( @xmath72 ) , the ratios @xmath78 approach the particle mass ratios of the corresponding massive field theory .",
    "the masses of the eight stable particles are proportional to the entries of the perron - frobenius eigenvector of the cartan matrix of the lie algebra @xmath5 and their ratios ( ordered by magnitude ) are given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 defines the mass scale .",

    "@xcite , each of the corresponding eight massive particles is associated to a particular string in the ba solution .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that , apart from these eight strings and the one - strings forming the vacuum solutions , no other string types occur in thermodynamically relevant quantities . with these assumptions ,",
    "the tba equations imply that the hole - type excitations in the one - strings have vanishing density .",
    "the density of one - strings can be eliminated from the calculation , which finally leads to the @xmath81 scattering matrix of the @xmath5 factorized scattering theory @xcite .    in table",

    "[ t : st ] , the string of type @xmath83 consists of @xmath84 roots of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the center of the string on the real line .",
    "for the numerical treatment of the bae ( [ e : bae ] ) we used a modified newton method @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed in extended precision fortran ( with 16 byte real numbers ) on an ibm workstation .    as a first step , we solved the bae at criticality ( @xmath25 ) for small system size and compared the corresponding eigenvalues ( [ e : eval ] ) to those obtained by direct diagonalization of the transfer matrix using high precision arithmetics .",
    "this also served as a test of the performance of our programs .",
    "in particular , the _ complete _ set of solutions corresponding to zero - momentum eigenstates of the transfer matrix for systems of size @xmath87 was obtained . in this way",
    ", the structure of the solutions for the largest eigenvalues could be identified .",
    "these solutions were followed as a function of the elliptic nome @xmath19 .",
    "the results of this analysis were then generalized to larger system size by looking for solutions of the same type which differ by additional real roots only .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the mass ratios in the scaling limit , we exclusively considered zero momentum states . for solutions of the bae",
    ", the momentum is obtained from the eigenvalue @xmath88 ( [ e : eval ] ) at spectral parameter @xmath89 , where the transfer matrix reduces to a shift operator .",
    "because we want to follow solutions for varying @xmath19 , which means that we have to repeat the calculation for a large number of values of @xmath19 , we limited ourselves to systems of size @xmath90 .",
    "however , in certain cases the numerical accuracy of the calculations becomes the major problem .",
    "this happens for instance for ba solutions which contain roots that are very close to singularities of the bae , or for solutions where differences between roots ( respectively their real parts ) become extremely small .",
    "these situations typically show up if one considers large values of the elliptic nome @xmath19 ( where the meaning of `` large '' depends on the system size ) , but also for the massive excitations of the critical dilute @xmath0 model discussed in section  [ ss : me ] below .",
    "as far as we can see , there are only two ways to go beyond the limitations imposed by these numerical problems ; either by using higher precision arithmetics , or , to a lesser extent , by adjusting the program according to each specific type of ba solution ( which we did to some extent by treating the ubiquitous complex conjugate pairs of ba roots with imaginary parts close to @xmath91 in a special way ) .      in the critical limit ( @xmath25 , @xmath51 ) , the largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix organize according to the characters of representations of the virasoro algebra with central charge @xmath2 as described in section  [ ss : cs ] above .",
    "schematically , the resulting values for the scaling dimensions @xmath92 in the zero - momentum sector and their distribution into the three sectors labeled by @xmath93 are shown in fig .",

    "[ t : c ] , numerical values for the central charge and the lowest scaling dimensions obtained from the corresponding solutions of the bae for systems of different sizes are presented . here , eq .",

    "all zero - momentum states with a critical scaling dimension of @xmath94 have been found , compare fig .",
    "[ f : conf ] , except one of the four excitations with conformal dimensions @xmath95 for which , despite some effort , we have not been able to find the corresponding solution of the bae . in particular , this includes all cases without degeneracy , i.e. , where only a single zero - momentum state of a certain scaling dimension occurs in the conformal tower .    to keep the three remaining ba solutions with scaling dimension @xmath96 apart , we distinguish them by subscripts @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "actually , it turns out that the two solutions denoted by @xmath98 and @xmath99 yield the same eigenvalue even for finite systems , which remains true also off - criticality .",
    "thus , we do not need to consider them separately unless we are interested in the ba solutions , which of course are different , see section  [ ss : bar ] below .",
    "while the numerical data are in perfect agreement with the exact values , it should be noted that the string structure of the critical ba solutions have no apparent similarity to those proposed in ref .",
    "we shall come back to this point later .      analyzing the spectrum of largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix",
    ", one observes that , in addition to the conformal spectrum discussed above , the spectrum contains _ massive _ excitations .",
    "more precisely , these are states with eigenvalues @xmath100 for which the quantities @xmath101 converge to a non - zero limit ( mass ) as @xmath51 , compare eq .",
    "( [ e : xj ] ) for the conformal states where this limit gives zero .    apparently , a number of different masses is involved , which are again characterized by particular strings in the ba solutions . strikingly , the strings which we observed are among those listed in table  [ t : st ] .",
    "we have found explicit solutions containing strings of type @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . in all cases , the roots forming these strings are  even for small systems  located extremely close to the singularity of the bae which they approach for @xmath51 .",
    "this asks for a careful numerical treatment , and severely limits the system sizes we can treat . with the numerical accuracy of our program",
    ", we were able to get reliable results for systems of at most 2030 sites , depending on the particular solution .",
    "an example is given in table  [ t : me ] . here , the solutions obtained by adding a number of `` massive '' two - strings ( @xmath104 ) to the ground - state solution of a system of size @xmath105 are presented . from the eigenvalues for larger systems , one can see that each additional `` massive '' two - string just adds the same mass , thus substantiating our interpretation in terms of massive particles .    apparently , it is possible to add arbitrary numbers of these `` massive '' strings not only to the ground - state , but to _ each _ solution corresponding to a conformal state .",
    "this means that the spectrum ( at the critical point @xmath25 ) contains infinitely many copies of the complete conformal spectrum , shifted with respect to the ground - state by a mass determined by the collection of `` massive '' strings .    as to the observed `` massive '' strings , they fall into two classes : for @xmath106 , and @xmath103",
    ", we have a single solution of the bae , whereas for @xmath107 and @xmath108 the solutions belong to eigenvalues which are doubly degenerate ( for finite systems ) . labeling the masses associated to the `` massive '' string type @xmath83 by @xmath109",
    ", we obtain the numerical estimates @xmath110 for the ratios of the masses with respect to the smallest mass which is associated to the two - string ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "note that these numbers are calculated from the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix with spectral parameter @xmath55 .",
    "this situation is similar to what is observed in the hubbard model , where one has two types of excitations : so - called `` holons '' ( carrying charge but no spin ) and `` spinons '' ( carrying spin but no charge ) @xcite .",
    "generically , both excitations are massless , and the corresponding field theory consists of two coupled @xmath111 cft . however",
    ", if the filling fraction ( number of electrons per lattice site ) is chosen to be precisely one , the holons become massive while the spinons stay massless . at low energies ,",
    "this theory is then described by a @xmath111 cft with additional massive excitations @xcite .      as mentioned above",
    ", the string structure of the ba roots at criticality does not seem to agree with the predictions of ref .",
    "however , if one follows a particular solution as a function of the nome @xmath19 , one finds that in many cases one encounters singularities of the bae where the string structure changes .",
    "the simplest example is given by the second largest eigenvalue , which corresponds to the conformal spin density field with dimensions @xmath112 in the critical limit and to the lightest massive particle in the massive scaling limit . at criticality ,",
    "the corresponding solution of the bae differs from that of the largest eigenvalue ( which contains real roots @xmath50 only ) by a single root with imaginary part @xmath113 .",
    "however , as can been seen from fig .",
    "[ f : bas ] , as @xmath19 is increased from @xmath25 , the complex root and one real root approach each other , until their real parts agree . at that point ,",
    "the real parts of the two roots stay the same , but they move in the imaginary direction until they form a complex conjugate pair of roots ( hence a two - string ) , which then persists for large values of @xmath19 .",
    "comparing systems of different size , this mechanism stays always the same , the additional real roots just play the rle of spectators .",
    "moreover , the transition from one string type to another takes place at approximately the same value of the scaling parameter @xmath74 ( [ e : mu ] ) as the system size is increased .",
    "more precisely , the scaling parameter values approach a non - zero limit as the system size tends to infinity .",
    "this implies that although @xmath69 in the scaling limit , for large values of @xmath74 ( and in particular for the massive scaling limit @xmath72 ) , the two - string is the relevant type of solution .",
    "the same scenario applies to the other excitations we considered . in table",
    "[ t : ss ] , we compiled numerical values of the non - real ba roots for systems of size @xmath114 , both at criticality ( @xmath25 , i.e.  @xmath71 ) and for a rather large value @xmath115 of the scaling parameter ( corresponding to @xmath116 for @xmath114 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath117 the real part of the roots @xmath50 can be shifted by multiples of @xmath118 ( @xmath36 ) as discussed in section  [ ss : bae ] above .",
    "using this property , we arranged the solutions such that the values of the non - real roots have a real part in the interval @xmath119 .",
    "actually , as table  [ t : ss ] suggests , all non - real roots are located in the vicinity of @xmath120 for sufficiently large scaling parameters @xmath74 .",
    "this also distinguishes these solutions from the `` massive '' strings at criticality considered above , whose centers are located close to the origin .",
    "furthermore , the values of the nome @xmath19 where changes in the string patterns for @xmath114 occur are also indicated in table  [ t : ss ] .",
    "all five single - particle states show at least one such point , whereas some of the two - particle states do not change as @xmath19 is varied .",
    "although the relation between the scaling exponents on one end and the content of massive particles on the other is determined by the field theory , we are not aware that it has been calculated .",
    "our results given in table  [ t : ss ] give an unambiguous connection for the lowest states , but they do not suggest an obvious pattern that can be generalized to the higher excitations .    comparing with the proposed string types of ref .",
    "@xcite given in table  [ t : st ] and by eq .",
    "( [ e : strings ] ) , one finds that the solutions for large scaling parameter agree with the predictions apart from the two states which contain a particle of mass @xmath8 . here , in place",
    "of a five - string with imaginary parts @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath113 , the solution found numerically on first view looks more like a seven - string with imaginary parts @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath113 .",
    "however , in comparison to the other single - particle states , the real parts of the roots forming this `` string '' are quite far apart , which might be an indication for another change of pattern occurring at a larger value of @xmath19 , which of course we can not exclude on the basis of our numerical data .",

    "[ f : bam4_20 ] , no indication of this behavior remains , and the same holds true for the larger systems ( up to @xmath114 ) which we examined . from this , we conclude that either there is no further change in the string pattern , or it has to occur for a very large value of the scaling parameter @xmath74 , which however seems rather unlikely to us .",
    "though this result is somewhat inconclusive , let us examine the string pattern of this solution in more detail . in particular , we are interested in the question whether there are holes in the one - strings in this case . to see this , we consider the `` phase function '' @xmath130 \\label{e : ph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is basically the logarithm of the bae ( [ e : bae ] ) , but now @xmath131 denote the roots of our particular ba solution , and we consider @xmath132 as a function of the complex variable @xmath133 . by definition ,",

    ", the location of this single root coincides _ precisely _ with a hole in the one - strings , which may seem to disagree with the findings of ref .",

    ", it thus seems that the string structure associated to the mass @xmath8 consists of the rather complicated pattern of a seven - string involving three complex conjugate pairs of roots ( with imaginary parts @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) and a neighboring root at @xmath138 which comes together with a hole in the one - string distribution .",
    "of course , in the infinite size limit the distance between the real parts of these roots becomes infinitesimal .",
    "it is not obvious what happens in the tba calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite if their string type @xmath139 ( see table  [ t : st ] ) is replaced by the observed pattern , especially as we did not see the strings associated to the three largest masses . nevertheless , we believe that the main ideas underlying the tba treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite are correct , and that only details of the calculation would be affected .",
    "before we move on to the discussion of the scaling function , two short remarks regarding the ba solutions are in order . it should be noted that the `` massive '' strings mentioned previously in section  [ ss : me ] , which yield the massive excitations _ at criticality _ , do not undergo similar changes .",
    "these strings are always located very close to singularities of the bae , and move even closer as the nome @xmath19 is increased .",
    "moreover , their centers lie at the origin , see e.g.  table  [ t : me ] , whereas for the states belonging to the @xmath5 integrable field theory the strings cluster around the value @xmath120 .",
    "finally , let us mention that a similar behavior of ba roots has recently been observed in the solution of the xxz heisenberg chain , where the boundary twist acts as the varying parameter  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the results for the scaling functions @xmath140 ( [ e : f0 ] ) and @xmath141 ( [ e : fj ] ) .",
    "for the latter , all zero - momentum states with a critical scaling dimension of @xmath94 are considered , except the one missing excitation with conformal dimensions @xmath95 . in all cases ,",
    "we use data from systems of size @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath114 . for these sizes and the values of @xmath19 we considered",
    ", it turns out that the corrections to scaling are so small that one can hardly recognize them in our figures .    in fig .",
    "[ f : gsf ] , the ( natural ) logarithm of @xmath140 ( which as defined in eq .",
    "( [ e : f0 ] ) is positive ) is shown as a function of @xmath129 ( [ e : mu ] ) .",
    "apart from the behavior for small @xmath19 , the plot is nicely linear , showing the exponential decrease of @xmath144 as a function of @xmath145 down to about @xmath146 where the difference between the eigenvalues for the finite sizes and the bulk limit value becomes smaller than our numerical precision , which also proves the performance of our numerical routines .",
    "small deviations from scaling can be seen for larger values of @xmath19 .",
    "the scaling functions for the excitations @xmath141 ( [ e : fj ] ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : sf ] .",
    "the curves shown are piecewise linear plots connecting data points obtained from systems with @xmath114 . for convenience",
    ", we again used @xmath129 ( [ e : mu ] ) on the horizontal axis .",
    "qualitatively , the scaling functions agree with the results of previous numerical calculations for the ising model in a magnetic field @xcite and with the results of the truncated fermionic space approach , compare the figures given in ref .",
    "the one - particle states can be recognized by their characteristic minima @xcite .",
    "this becomes clearer when we consider their ratios @xmath147 ( [ e : rj ] ) which are presented in fig .",
    "[ f : ratios ] . here",
    ", we again show individual data points which were obtained from systems of size @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath114 , which obviously were large enough to keep corrections to scaling small .",
    "the ratios @xmath147 , given here against the scaling variable @xmath74 , are labeled by the corresponding conformal dimensions at criticality .",
    "we also indicated the single - particle mass ratios ( [ e : masses ] ) of the @xmath5 field theory .",
    "clearly , the agreement is convincing , more detail on the approach of the massive scaling limit is contained in table  [ t : rat ] .",
    "the spectrum of the dilute @xmath0 model has been studied by numerical solution of the bethe ansatz equations , both at and off - criticality .",
    "this gives the correspondence between the lowest states of the conformal spectrum of the critical ising model and those of the massive @xmath5 field theory ( note that the connection given in ref .",
    "@xcite contains an obvious mistake ) .    at criticality ,",
    "the spectrum consists for one part of massless excitations described by @xmath2 minimal cft as in the critical ising model , but in addition to these it contains massive excitations .",
    "obviously , the masses of these excitations are linked to the appearance of particular strings in the bethe ansatz solutions , which can be interpreted as massive particles . in our numerical analysis , we have seen at least five such `` massive '' strings .",
    "it is intriguing that all these strings ( showing up in solutions _ at criticality _ ) are among the conjectured list of `` thermodynamically significant string types '' in the tba analysis @xcite of the massive scaling limit .",
    "this is strongly suggestive of a connection between the lie algebra @xmath5 and the masses of these excitations .",
    "however , these are not the states which yield zamolodchikov s @xmath5 field theory of the ising model in a magnetic field .",
    "those correspond to massless excitations at the critical point , which develop a mass due to the existence of the symmetry - breaking field . at criticality",
    ", the string structure of these states does not agree with the predictions of @xcite  to solve this puzzle had been the original motivation for this work .",
    "our numerical results suggest a scenario that may solve this apparent contradiction : the string type of the relevant excitations undergoes a number of changes as the field is switched on , and for large systems these reorganizations take place at particular values of the scaling parameter @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the string structure entering the massive scaling limit @xmath72 is that observed for large values of the elliptic nome @xmath19 .",
    "numerically , we have been able to identify the single particle states up to the fifth mass , and a number of two - particle states",
    ". clearly , our results for the scaling functions are in complete agreement with both the analytic values of the mass ratios and with earlier numerical work on the ising model in a magnetic field . as to the bethe ansatz solutions , apart from one exception , the string structure for large field is that conjectured in @xcite .",
    "the one exception concerns the string type associated to the particle of mass @xmath8 .",
    "we found two states which contain this particle  one being the single particle state with conformal dimensions @xmath148 , the other a two - particle state which also contains the lightest particle and has scaling dimensions @xmath149 at criticality . in both cases ,",
    "the observed string structures agree , but they differ from the one proposed in @xcite , compare table  [ t : ss ] . of course , it can not be ruled out completely that another change of string type appears at a larger value of the scaling parameter , but we found no trace of such a behavior for scaling parameters up to @xmath150 .",
    "this clearly demands further clarification , and maybe the investigation of the dilute @xmath151 model can lead the way . in the scaling limit , this model is described by an @xmath152 theory of factorized scattering , but has so far eluded a tba approach analogous to that of @xcite . in this case , we have been able to identify _ all _ seven single - particle states and observed interesting string solutions , details will be published soon @xcite .",
    "a number of interesting questions arise in connection with the massive excitations of the critical dilute @xmath0 model .",
    "this is one property of the dilute @xmath0 model which distinguishes it from the proper ising model in a magnetic field , since the critical ising model does not show such excitations .",
    "moreover , we suppose that this phenomenon is not particular to the specific model and will show up in the other dilute models as well . it would be interesting to understand the physical nature of these excitations , and to obtain analytic predictions for the observed mass ratios . also , their dispersion relations have not been studied because we concentrated on momentum zero states throughout this work .",
