    "it has been suggested that such a term is responsible for the finite conductivity of graphene described by a massless dirac energy spectrum  @xcite . in other words , it is zb that makes it impossible to localize relativistic particles , as it is connected with the uncertainty of the position of a relativistic quantum particle due to the creation of particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "therefore , the origin of delocalization characterizing the non - abelian system that persists even for infinite disorder ( @xmath234 ) can be attributed to zb .",
