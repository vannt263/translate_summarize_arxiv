    "in the last years the developement of more accurate methods of investigations such as angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , joined with the fabrication of novel materials as high - tc superconductors @xcite , colossal magnetoresistance manganites @xcite , correlated oxides @xcite , topological insulators @xcite and graphene @xcite in different topological conditions ( from bulk , to surfaces and eterostructures , up to single monolayers ) , allowed a deep insight in low - energy electronic and spectral properties .",
    "the countinuosly increased measurements accuracy in experiments gives the opportunity to detect and study such low - energy features which in many cases were recognized as the fingerprint of the electron - phonon interaction .    the possibility to tune the chemical potential by doping offers a great potentially useful way to modify the materials electronic structures and properties .",
    "very recently , in the low doping conditions electron - phonon signatures were successfully detected in the arpes spectra of many different systems , from oxygen vacancies doped @xmath0 surface @xcite or lightly bulk doped @xmath0 @xcite , to monolayer pnictide @xmath1 growth on @xmath0 @xcite , from tridimensional anatase @xcite to @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite superconductors , up to @xmath4 topological non - trivial materials as @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , as well as on the quasi two - dimensional layered lightly - doped @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "such a rich variety of different materials displaying common electron - phonon low - energy features calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism at play .",
    "however , once all these systems are taken into account and in particular when dealing with surfaces , monolayers and low - dimensional systems , the role of disorder can not be neglected .",
    "in fact the growth processes on substrates and/or the action of chemical doping imply the presence of disorder , whose impact largely depends on which energy scale one is focused on .",
    "for example , impurity bands can be formed close to the conduction band of the pristine material as a consequence of the presence of the dopant energy levels @xcite , or can have magnetic origins as in mn - doped gaas @xcite . on the other hand , oxygen vacancies on the substrate",
    "@xcite may represents centers of scatterings for carriers in the deposited film .",
    "interestingly in this sense , recent arpes experiments and ab - initio theoretical works suggest how charge carriers can be trapped by oxygen vacancies at the @xmath8/@xmath0 ( lao / sto ) interface @xcite and @xmath0 surface @xcite , naturally introducing the role of disorder in the understanding of the electronic properties of oxide - oxide heterostructure interfaces and oxide surfaces , where confined two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) should also undergo superconducting phase transitions @xcite .",
    "usually disorder can be added perturbatively in the theoretical explanation of arpes spectra as a weak source of scattering leading to an intrinsic band linewidth . within this approach ,",
    "interactions such as electron - phonon coupling contribute to the low - energy properties of the spectrum and the disorder simply provides a further smearing of the electron - phonon features .",
    "however this is not the case when disorder and electron - phonon interaction act on comparable energy scales . for example",
    "let us consider the case of an intermediate electron - phonon coupling ; in the very low doping limit , the system is prone to polaron formation and the presence of scattering centers may provide , in a synergic way , the necessary energy to stabilize a small polaron @xcite .",
    "another example is that of a low ( but finite ) electron density and weak electron - phonon coupling . in this case",
    "when disorder and electron - phonon interaction are treated self - consistently impurity and phonon contributions to electron scattering are not additive when the fermi energy is of the order of the phonon frequency @xcite , and impurity scattering has a significant nonlinear effect @xcite . in this work",
    "we approach the problem of the interplay between disorder and electron - phonon interaction starting from a weak electron - phonon coupling , going beyond the self - consistent born approximation used in refs .",
    "@xcite by using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) thus extending our treatement to the case of strong disorder .",
    "previous studies of models in this peculiar regime concentrated on the case of classical phonons in binary alloys @xcite or , in the same context , on the effects of electron - phonon interaction on transport properties at high temperature@xcite .",
    "electron - phonon interaction and strong disorder have also been studied in the classical phonon case @xcite within the context of the falicov - kimball model of correlated electrons , for which cpa is the exact solution @xcite .",
    "noticeably , the mott transition in the falicov - kimball model can be described as a disorder - induced metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in the alloy context @xcite .",
    "here we address the single particle properties , namely how disorder and electron - phonon interaction modifies arpes spectra of lightly - doped materials @xcite .",
    "a proper quantum treatment of the phonon is , in this case , crucial to explain the low energy features of arpes spectra .",
    "the disorder - induced metal - insulator transition is also studied as it depends on the strength of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ hamiltonians ] we discuss the model hamiltonians and the types of electron - phonon couplings taken into account in this work . in section [ methods ] we explain how such models can be solved in presence of local disorder as introduced by an anderson type hamiltonian , and we discuss the fluctuation of the electron - phonon self - energy due to disorder . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the main results of our work discussing the interplay between electron - phonon interaction and disorder to explain the features of the arpes spectra , we discuss also the electron - phonon dependence of the disorder - induced metal - insulator transitiion . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we draw our conclusions and further remarks .",

    ", the action of such a strong disorder does not prevent the typical fingerprints of the electron - phonon interaction , as the kinks at the phonon frequency ( see appendix [ appendixd2akw ] ) .",
    "this result highlights the fact that when disorder and electron - phonon coupling interact at the same energy scales , as in the considered case , the action of disorder can not be taken into account as a simple broadening of the spectral features in absence of disorder , since disorder and electron - phonon interaction work in a cooperative way .    in panel d ) we plot the spectra obtained using a gaussian disorder with @xmath101 .",
    "we have chosen the variance of disorder requiring the same value of the fermi @xmath102 as that given by the @xmath103% impurities . in this case",

    "moreover we see that within cpa1 scheme the effect of disorder is largely dominant , as can be seen by comparing the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : cpa2vscpa1dos ] ( lower left panel ) and that obtained in the presence of pure disorder ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] c ) ) . since in cpa1",
    "we average the electron - phonon self - energy over the disorder variable we can ascribe the large discrepancies between the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpa2vscpa1dos ] to the correlation between electron - phonon and disorder effects in the self - energy .",
    "this issue can be analyzed from the point of view of perturbative expansions .",
    "the resummation in cpa2 scheme of diagrams of type a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpa2vscpa1diagrams ] which take into account the correlation at the hartree level between electron - phonon and local disorder , leads to an enhancement of the electron - phonon interaction effects on the energy scale of the emerging impurity band ( around @xmath116 from the fermi level ) .",
    "in contrast to cpa1 the cpa2 hartree term is correlated to the presence of the impurity leading to the @xmath109 dependence of the disorder - induced metal - insulator transition ( see discussion above and upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mott_x=0.05 ] ) . for this reason , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpa2vscpa1dos ] , the impurity band within cpa2 seems to be more marked than that in cpa1 .",
    "however another aspect is clear from the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpa2vscpa1dos ] : the cpa2 impurity band is also much wider that that obtained within cpa1 , and , despite the strong disorder , prominent phonon signatures are still evident on the impurity band .",
    "this should be ascribed to the correlation between disorder and electron - phonon self - energy at the fock level diagrams of type b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpa2vscpa1diagrams ] . in previous work",
    "an interplay between electron - phonon interaction and disorder has been found within self - consistent born approximation @xcite in which , despite the self - energy separates into electron - phonon and disorder parts , non additivity in electron scattering time is found due to the self - consistency condition .",
    "we remark here the difference in our strong - disorder approach in which the self - energy appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gloc ] ) is no longer separable into two contributions .",
    "we thus have analyzed the strong fluctuations of the self - energy due to disorder rather than its separability into electron - phonon and disorder part .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we have investigated the role of the electron - phonon interaction in disordered systems , and their strong interplay when the energy scales in which they act are comparable . it is well known that trapping impurities provide the necessary energy for the polaronic transition stabilizing the polaronic state at weaker electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "here we have discussed this interplay at finite electron density and weak electron - phonon coupling , thus relying our study on the ppnca to deal with weak electron - phonon interaction . we have developed a theoretical method to combine the ppnca with the cpa to study strongly disordered systems , and we have extended such theory to the apical oxygens model @xcite and to a non - local electron - phonon interaction characteristic of couplings with crystal s polar modes .",
    "we mainly focused our attention on low dimensional systems such as quasi twodimensional or layered ones , since in these cases the effect of disorder can in principle be larger with respect to purely 3d systems . on the other hand",
    ", we concentrated on low doped systems in which the impurity band can be very close , and hybridizes , with the bottom of the electronic one .",
    "this peculiar , but quite common experimental and theoretical evidence @xcite allowed us to study when disorder and electron - phonon interaction act in a cooperative way , and the action of disorder can not be included in a perturbative way as a source of weak broadening of the spectral features . on the contrary , impurity - type disorder strongly affects the electronic structure giving rise to a significant spectral weight redistribution .",
    "this could lead to a dramatic fermi surface reduction even at moderate electron - phonon couplings , which in turns can be detected as a luttinger s theorem violation@xcite and eventually an electron - phonon driven metal - insulator transition as the fermi surface vanishes . from a quantitative point of view , the strongest interplay between electron - phonon and local disorder is found for the local electron - phonon interaction ( loc model ) .",
    "non - local couplings studied in this work ( ao , nloc ) both display a less effective interplay with disorder as a consequence of the interactions non - locality .",
    "cpa approximation used to approach the strong disorder regime is a reasonable approximation for the dos or the average spectral function in three dimensions @xcite . in our 2 ( loc , nloc ) or 2 + 1 ( ao ) dimensional systems there are however some deviations which can be treated within a non - local dca framework @xcite . generally speaking cpa overestimates the disorder induced gap . as a consequence in our treatment of the disorder - induced mit we expect that the disorder needed to reach the mit would be slightly lower going beyond cpa .",
    "localization effects , absent in cpa approach , which are however beyond the present work , can be relevant for transport properties in low dimensional systems .",
    "their effects can be probed at the local level by anomalous fluctuations of the local doss which can be relevant to tunneling experiments . instead of the averaged dos taken into account in this work one can consider the typical dos obtained as geometric averages of local doss @xcite . as far as local quantities are concerned for the loc model one can generalize our self - consistency equations to the case of typical quantities following the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ppnca approximation for electron - phonon interaction used in our work can not be used to attach the polaronic regime which can be interesting to study , since the recently found polaronic resonances in single layer high-@xmath117 superconducting @xmath1 @xcite . also from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the interplay between disorder and polaronic electron - phonon interaction could be much different from that proposed in the present paper @xcite .",
    "to this aim a beyond - nca approach such as dmft should be useful also to include electronic correlations .",
    "a cluster - dmft approach could also be useful to include spatial correlations which we neglect in our local approach in the loc model case , overcoming in this way the well known problems of single site dmft in dealing with systems at low dimensionality @xcite .",
