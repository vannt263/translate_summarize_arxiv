    "a future discovery of a charged higgs boson would be a sure sign of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) includes in its particle content charged higgs bosons in addition to neutral higgs .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson , including the charged higgs of the mssm , is a major goal at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the lhc has good potential for discovery of a charged higgs .",
    "a promising channel is @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the complete next - to - leading order qcd corrections to this process have been recently derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the born cross section is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath3 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets in the mssm .",
    "we use the @xmath4 running top and bottom quark masses , corresponding to pole masses @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev , in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 terms , but set @xmath9 elsewhere .",
    "the production cross section for @xmath10 at the lhc for large @xmath11 is actually dominated by soft - gluon corrections from the near - threshold region @xcite .",
    "we define the standard kinematical invariants @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . at threshold @xmath16 .",
    "the threshold soft - gluon corrections then take the form @xmath17_+$ ] , with @xmath18 for the order @xmath19 corrections .",
    "they are calculated following the methods in refs .",
    "@xcite , which have been applied to various processes @xcite .",
    "the leading logarithms ( ll ) are with @xmath20 while the next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) are with @xmath21 . here",
    "we calculate nlo and nnlo soft - gluon corrections corrections at nll accuracy .",
    "we denote them as nlo - nll and nnlo - nll , respectively .",
    "thus , at nlo we include @xmath22_+$ ] ( ll ) and @xmath23_+$ ] ( nll ) terms .",
    "although we do not include the full virtual @xmath24 terms , we include those @xmath24 terms that involve the factorization and renormalization scales , denoted by @xmath25 . at nnlo ,",
    "we include @xmath26_+$ ] ( ll ) and @xmath27_+$ ] ( nll ) terms .",
    "we also include some @xmath22_+$ ] and @xmath23_+$ ] terms that involve the scale @xmath25 and some @xmath28 and @xmath29 constants .",
    "explicit analytical expressions are given in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the cross section for charged higgs production via @xmath0 at the lhc as a function of the charged higgs mass for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the approximate nnlo parton distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite have been used .",
    "we note that in the corresponding figures in refs .",
    "@xcite the pole mass of the bottom quark was used ; the @xmath4 mass , however , is a preferable choice @xcite .",
    "the born , nlo - nll , and nnlo - nll cross sections are shown .",
    "the cross sections span over two orders of magnitude in the mass range 200 gev @xmath32 1000 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the @xmath33-factors , i.e. the ratios of the nlo - nll and nnlo - nll cross sections to the born cross section , and the ratio of the nnlo - nll to the nlo - nll cross section .",
    "we use the same nnlo parton densities and couplings at all orders , so as to concentrate on the effect of the soft - gluon corrections .",
    "it should be stressed that the nlo - nll / born ratio is quite close to the exact nlo / born ratio @xcite ( note that different conventions and scales are used there ) which indicates that threshold corrections indeed dominate the cross section .",
    "the difference between the exact nlo and nlo - nll results is only a few percent .",
    "the nnlo - nll corrections provide a significant enhancement to the nlo cross section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the cross section with two different choices of scale , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for clarity",
    "we concentrate on @xmath36 gev .",
    "we see that the variation with scale of the born cross section is large .",
    "the variation at nlo - nll is smaller , and at nnlo - nll it is very small .",
    "in fact the two nnlo - nll curves are on top of each other for most of the range in @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the scale dependence of the cross section is drastically reduced when higher - order corrections are included .",
    "finally , we note that the cross section for @xmath37 is the same as for @xmath0 .",
