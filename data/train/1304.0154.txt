    "this work is devoted to study the routing capabilities of three proactive protocols named as destination - sequence distance vector ( dsdv ) @xcite , fish - eye state routing ( fsr ) @xcite and optimized link state routing ( olsr ) @xcite in different network cases of wmhns .    in literature",
    ", we find different analysis on performance of routing protocols for different scenarios .",
    "a scalability analysis is presented in @xcite , which evaluates routing protocols with respect to different number of ( cbr ) resources .",
    "this analysis describes performance evaluation of aodv and dsr protocols influenced by the network size ( up to @xmath0 nodes ) , nodes mobility and density .",
    "the authors in @xcite evaluate the performance of dsr and aodv with varied number of sources ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 sources with different pause time ) .",
    "they demonstrate that even though dsr and aodv share a similar on - demand behavior , the differences in the protocol mechanics can lead to significant performance differentials . the problem from a different perspective",
    "is discussed in @xcite , using the simulation model with a dynamic network size and is examined practically for dsdv , aodv @xcite , dsr @xcite and temporally ordered routing algorithm ( tora ) .",
    "the authors in @xcite examine the performance of proactive routing protocols .",
    "they set up a mathematical model to optimize proactive routing overhead without disturbing accuracy of routes .",
    "they present a generalized mathematical model for proactive routing protocol and specifically study the use of ack mechanism .",
    "finally they deduce that by optimizing the time interval of hello messages , proactive protocol will have less routing overhead and high delivery rate .",
    "their evaluation based on mathematical model is generalized for proactive class , however , in our work , we specifically discuss the behavior of reactive ( aodv , dsr , dymo ) along with proactive protocols ( dsdv , fsr and olsr ) .",
    "dsdv protocol performs three type of maintenance operations ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 as mentioned in @xcite . whereas , this protocol sends routing messages for @xmath5 and @xmath4 , because of link sensing from mac layer .",
    "so , @xmath6 of dsdv depends on the interval of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , dsdv uses flooding mechanism to disseminate routing information .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 represents @xmath6 of periodic and trigger updates of dsdv , and we can write the total @xmath6 as :    @xmath9    @xmath10    where , generation of @xmath11 depends on status of @xmath12 among @xmath13 .      to avoid routing overhead ,",
    "fsr only uses periodic maintenance operations ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "mac layer notification and scope routing _ ( sr ) _ are performed , respectively . in _ sr _ , diameter of whole network is divided into scopes and information is exchanged between scopes using graded - frequency technique .",
    "two scopes ; inter - scope and intra - scope are defined for fsr in @xcite and @xmath6 for these scopes is given below :    @xmath14    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are intrascope_interval and interscope_interval , respectively ( table .",
    "1 ) . whereas , @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent total number of nodes in intrascope ( ias ) and interscope ( ies ) .      in olsr , @xmath3 and @xmath5",
    "are used to get information for links and routes .",
    "@xmath3 is performed by generating hello messages on routing layer after @xmath20 ( @xmath3 table .",
    "1 ) . whereas , @xmath11 is broadcasted through tc messages .",
    "the interval between successive @xmath11 depends on stability of mprs .",
    "this stability is periodically confirmed through hello messages . on the other hand , to calculate topology information , tc messages are broadcasted .",
    "the broadcasting period of tc message depends on status of mprs after @xmath21 ( default value as mentioned in table 1 ) if mprs are stable , while these messages are triggered and are transmitted to whole network in case of unstable mprs , when node 6 detects link breakage then olsr generates @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath6 of olsr is given below :    @xmath22    @xmath23    .predefined parameters values [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]",
    "to evaluate chosen protocols , we take different mobilities , scalabilities .",
    "we selected three performance metrics ; throughput , @xmath24 and @xmath6 .",
    "we analytically simulate @xmath24 in terms of routing overhead and @xmath6 in terms of frequency of topological exchange period .",
    "the performance metrics are measured through simulations in ns-2 . for simulation setup ,",
    "random way - point is used as mobility models .",
    "the area specified is @xmath25 field presenting a square space to allow mobile nodes to move inside .",
    "all of the nodes are provided with wireless links of a bandwidth of @xmath26 to transmit on .",
    "simulations are run for @xmath27 each . for evaluating mobilities effects , we vary pause time from @xmath28 to @xmath27 for @xmath29 nodes with speed @xmath30 . for evaluating different network flows with @xmath31 speed and fixed pause time of @xmath32",
    ", we vary nodes from @xmath1 nodes to @xmath33 nodes .      among proactive protocols",
    ", dsdv attains the highest throughput and shows efficient behavior in all pause times for , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] .",
    "the reason for this good throughput is to use of route settling time ; when the first data packet arrives , it is kept until the best route is found for a particular destination , thus overall satisfied constraints . secondly , a decision may delay to advertise the routes which are about to change soon , thus damping fluctuations of the route tables .",
    "the rebroadcasts of the routes with the same sequence number are minimized by delaying the advertisement of unstabilized routes .",
    "this enhances the accuracy of valid routes resulting in the increased throughput of dsdv in all types of mobility rates , moreover , the updates are transmitting through npdu s in small scalabilities .",
    "the reason for this gradual decrease with increasing mobility is the unavailability of valid routes due to its proactive nature .",
    "in static situation as well as low speed , in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] , throughput is better as compared to moderate and relatively high mobility due to availability of stable entries for mprs .",
    "thus , in moderate and no mobilities olsr performs well ( pause time more than @xmath34 represents moderate mobilities , while pause time @xmath27 means static mobile , because total simulation time is @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , fsr does not trigger any control messages unlike dsdv and olsr when links breaks .",
    "therefore , it is not as efficient as dsdv and olsr .",
    "[ h ]     [ h ]     [ h ]     [ h ]     fsr shows appreciable performance for varying traffic rates and olsr is well scalable among proactive protocols . in medium and high traffic loads , fsr s performance",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:08 ] .",
    "this is due to introduction of new technique of multi - level fish - eye scope ( fs ) , that reduces routing overhead and works better when available bandwidth is low , thus increasing throughput in case of increased data traffic loads and reduces routing update overhead .",
    "although , dsdv uses npdus to reduce routing transparency but @xmath11 causes routing overhead and degrades performance .",
    "olsr uses mprs for reduction of overhead but computation of these mprs takes more bandwidth .",
    "therefore its throughput is less than fsr .",
    "further optimization helps fsr to only broadcast topology messages to neighbors in order to reduce flooding overhead .",
    "if fsr would have taken mac layer feedback in case of link brakes then there might be exchange of messages to update neighbors , consuming bandwidth and lowering throughput .",
    "this faster discovery results in a better performance during high traffic loads .",
    "simulation results of olsr in fig .",
    "[ fig:07 ] comparative to fig .",
    "[ fig:08 ] show that it is scalable but less converged protocol for high traffic rates .",
    "this protocol is well suited for large and dense mobile networks , as it selects optimal routes ( in terms of number of hops ) and achieves more optimizations using mprs .",
    "olsr - m due to exchanging information of neighbors and with topology through frequent exchange results more throughput , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:05]-[fig:08 ] .      in all proactive protocols ,",
    "@xmath24 value is directly proportional to speed and mobility , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:09 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "dsdv possesses the highest delay cost among proactive in moderate and no mobility situations , as well as in all cases its e2ed is higher than olsr . because in dsdv , a data packet is kept for the duration between arrival of the first packet and selection of the best route for a particular destination .",
    "this selection creates delay in advertising routes which are about to change soon , thus causing damping fluctuations of the route tables .",
    "furthermore , advertisement of the routes which are not stabilized yet is delayed in order to reduce the number of rebroadcasts of possible route entries that normally arrive with the same sequence number .",
    "fsr at higher mobilities produces the highest @xmath24 value among proactive protocols .",
    "due to graded - frequency mechanism when mobility increases , routes to remote destinations become less accurate . however , when a packet approaches its destination , it finds increasingly accurate routing instructions as it enters sectors with a higher refresh rate . at moderate and",
    "no mobilities at all speeds , the value of end to end delay is the same as well as this delay is less than other proactive protocol due to sr .",
    "[ bt ]     [ bt ]     [ bt ]     [ bt ]     fsr overall suffers higher delay in scalabilities due to retain route entries for each destination , this protocol maintains low single packet latency when population is small as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] .",
    "the graded - frequency mechanism is used to find destination to keep routing overhead low .",
    "fsr exchanges updates more frequently to the near destinations .",
    "thus , in higher data rates or more scalabilities this protocol attains more @xmath24 value .",
    "the reason for delay in dsdv is that it waits to transmit a data packet for an interval between arrival of first route and the best route .",
    "this selection creates delay in advertising routes which are about to change soon .",
    "a node uses new entry for subsequent forwarding decisions and route settling time is used to decide how long to wait before advertising it .",
    "this strategy helps to compute accurate route but produces more delay .",
    "small values of @xmath24 for olsr are seen among proactive protocols in all scalabilities , because , mprs provides efficient flooding control mechanism ; instead of broadcasting , control packets are exchanged with neighbors only . in olsr - m , routing latency is further decreased as compared to olsr due decreasing @xmath35 and @xmath36 intervals ( figs .",
    "[ fig:09]-[fig:12 ] ) .",
    "to practically examine constraints of respective lp_models over proactive routing protocols , we select dsdv , fsr and olsr .",
    "we relate the effects of routing strategies of respective protocols over wmhns constraints to check energy efficient and delay reduction of these protocols in different scenarios in ns-2 .",
    "dsdv shows more convergence to high dynamicties due to @xmath11 after detecting link layer feed back and provides optimal solution against constraints of @xmath37 .",
    "fsr attains highest efficiency in more scalabilities by providing feasible solution against @xmath38 constraints due to scope routing . whereas , olsr and olsr - m achieves highest throughput in scalabilities , because of feasible solution through mprs against all constraints of @xmath39 ."
