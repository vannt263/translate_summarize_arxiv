    "the preceding paper  @xcite [ hereafter referred to as i and equations therein as e.g.  ( i.2.3 ) ] developed an eigenvector expansion for a broad class of systems with @xmath4 ohmically damped coupled oscillators , also applicable to interacting quantum systems .",
    "the key concept is a bilinear map @xmath5 , under which the time - evolution operator @xmath0 is symmetric : @xmath6 , thus allowing concepts familiar from conservative systems to be transcribed .    in i , it is assumed that ( a )  the eigenvectors @xmath7 of @xmath0 are complete and ( b )  @xmath8 for all @xmath9 .",

    "some results are known in a continuum limit  @xcite , but this paper gives a self - contained account , putting the concept of critical damping into a general framework , in which projections etc .",

    "it remains to orthogonalize the other blocks with respect to this first one",
    ". then relation ( [ eq : orth ] ) will hold for @xmath97 and any @xmath98 , which will not change when the blocks @xmath99 are mixed among themselves upon repeating the whole procedure .    for orthogonalizing the blocks @xmath99 with respect to the @xmath97 block , completing one iteration of the construction",
    ", it suffices to consider the top vectors @xmath100 : when their associated block is reconstructed by iterating @xmath96 , all vectors in it will be orthogonal to @xmath101 by virtue of ( [ eq : diag ] ) . by the same token ,",
    "@xmath102 already if @xmath103 . for @xmath104",
    ", this bilinear map can be made to vanish by @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the needed mixings are precisely those which conserve the block structure and are allowed by ( [ eq : free ] ) ; e.g. , in ( [ eq : exarray1 ] ) , in the course of the above we do not mix @xmath106 into @xmath107 .",
    "iterating the procedure until the number of blocks  @xmath86 is exhausted , we finally achieve ( [ eq : orth ] ) in general .",
    "clearly , all of the above goes through as well if level crossing occurs at several frequencies .      separating ( [ eq : comp4 ] ) into coordinates and",

    "inter - block matrix elements of @xmath153 can be handled in the split basis as well .",
    "in fact , there is not much to be gained by further analytic treatment ; one can simply diagonalize the relevant @xmath124 block of @xmath0 numerically and deal with inter - block interactions in the resultant basis , using the non - degenerate perturbation theory of  i.      the perturbation of a jb is said to be non - generic when @xmath161 .",
    "the simplest way to proceed is to expand ( [ eq : pertchar1 ] ) around @xmath14 ,    0 & = ( -1)^m_j j ( ) + & = ( ) ^m_j+ + & + ^2 [ j_2(_j ) + ] + .    in this case , @xmath162 ; assuming there is no higher - order nongenericity , i.e. , @xmath163 , ( [ eq : ngpert01 ] ) gives 0 = + .",
    "thus we see that ( a )  one state is unshifted to lowest order , and ( b )  the other states split like a generic jb of order @xmath164 , viz . , with @xmath165 and splitting in @xmath164 equiangular directions . [ if @xmath126 , the @xmath166 term is of the same order and must be retained .",

    "the exercise analogous to ( [ eq : jbh1])([eq : jbp04 ] ) and ( [ eq : jbp08 ] ) shows that @xmath167 , with =(_j,1,_j,0 ) = f_j,1 ( ) k ( , ) f_j,0 ( ) .    not much is gained by formally pursuing nongeneric perturbations any further , since in applications",
    "it is again preferable to simply diagonalize the ( typically small ) jb .      the above resolves the  small - denominator problem \" .",

    "already in part  i it has been argued that then @xmath169 while @xmath170 is finite , apparently causing @xmath171 to diverge .",

    "similar arguments prove the cancellation of small denominators in other physical quantities , or for other splitting patterns ( section  [ sect : jbpertnongen ] ) . these exactly parallel the discussion of excess noise ( over the standard schawlow  townes value ) in lossy laser cavities  @xcite .",
    "in fact , only the noise per mode is enhanced while the sum over all ( non - orthogonal ) modes has no excess contribution , consistent with the fluctuation  dissipation theorem .",
    "only perturbation theory requires special care : while a near - critical mode cluster shifts other eigenvalues by a finite amount , the cluster s modes themselves are highly sensitive to perturbations ( section  [ sect : jbperthigh])indeed , no cancellation is expected in the properties of _ individual _ modes .",
