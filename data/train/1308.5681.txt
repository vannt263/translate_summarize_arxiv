    "much of the optical emission from distant galaxies is absorbed by dust and re - radiated at sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) wavelengths @xcite .",
    "sub - mm observations have revealed a population of dusty galaxies at @xmath6 , previously hidden at optical wavelengths ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred star formation rates for these galaxies are huge , averaging at @xmath7 yr@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "observations of sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) allow us to examine star formation in the early universe and the strong cosmic evolution in the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "ground based surveys have managed to identify and study individual sub - mm sources @xcite .",
    "such surveys however covered small areas of sky and only found a few tens of smgs and suffered from biases in their selections .",
    "the blast survey @xcite covered @xmath9deg@xmath10 of sky and found a few hundred smgs @xcite but to really probe the evolution of the smgs with redshift much larger blind surveys are needed .    in order to investigate the smgs , particularly the evolution of the star formation rate and the luminosity function , we need to know",
    "the redshifts of all sources being considered .",
    "ideally this is done by matching a source to an optical counterpart and then measuring the redshift of this counterpart spectroscopically .",
    "however the poor angular resolution of sub - mm telescopes and high confusion between sources means that finding optical counterparts in this way is difficult .",
    "one method to find counterparts is to first match the sub - mm source to a mid - ir or radio source , then match the mid - ir / radio source to its corresponding optical counterpart .",
    "this can lead to a bias , however , as cold or high redshift objects are more likely to be undetected at mid - infrared and radio wavelengths @xcite .    fully exploiting the potential of sub - mm wavelengths on a large scale was impossible until the advent of the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the infrared emission of galaxies peaks between @xmath11 m , the wavebands that are covered by _",
    "herschel _ s two instruments : the spectral and photometric imaging receiver , spire @xcite , and the photodetector array camera and spectrometer , pacs @xcite .",
    "astrophysics terahertz large area survey , h - atlas @xcite , covers 550 deg@xmath10 of sky and is the largest sub - mm blind survey to date .",
    "the h - atlas fields were chosen partly due to the high quantity of complementary data at other wavelengths . however ,",
    "less than 10% of the h - atlas sources in the 15h field are detected by _ wise _ at 22@xmath5 m @xcite and current large - area radio surveys only detect a tiny fraction of h - atlas sources .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite have shown that it is possible , using a sophisticated baysian technique , to match the h - atlas sources to optically - detected galaxies directly . however , only approximately a third of the h - atlas sources have single reliable optical counterparts on images from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite which has limited subsequent investigations into the luminosity @xcite or dust mass @xcite functions .",
    "matching to the near infrared images from the viking survey produces a higher proportion of counterparts , 51% opposed to the 36% provided by the optical @xcite , but there are still a large number of sources without counterparts .",
    "co line spectroscopy , using wide band instruments , can be used to accurately measure the redshift of sub - mm sources without the need for accurate optical positions @xcite . however , co observations are time consuming and even with alma it will only be possible to measure redshifts for a tiny fraction of the h - atlas sources .",
    "the only feasible method currently for estimating redshifts for such a large number of _ herschel _ sources is to estimate the redshifts from the sub - mm fluxes themselves .",
    "previous attempts to estimate redshifts for _ herschel _ sources from the sub - mm fluxes have used as templates the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of individual galaxies e.g. @xcite .",
    "many of these template galaxies are at low redshift and their seds may not be representative of the seds of the high - redshift _ herschel _ sources and even if a high - redshift galaxy is used it may not be representative of the high - redshift population as a whole . for these reasons , we describe in this paper a method for creating a template directly from the sub - mm fluxes of all the high-@xmath12 h - atlas sources for which there are spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the seds are also important for increasing our understanding of the population of high - redshift dusty galaxies and investigating the seds at the range of wavelengths in which the dust emission is at its peak .",
    "the average sed that we derive in this paper , although obviously telling us nothing about the diversity of the population , is still useful for comparing this population with dusty galaxies of low redshift @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes the observations on which the method is based .",
    "we describe the method of template determination in section [ sec : sed ] and present the estimated redshift distributions in section [ sec : zdist ] .",
    "we summarise our results in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 = 70 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "phase 1 of the h - atlas survey covers around 160 deg@xmath10 of sky with both pacs observations at 100 and 160@xmath5 m and spire observations at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath5 m .",
    "however only a few percent of the h - atlas sources were detected at pacs wavelengths at greater than 5@xmath16 , so we have developed a method of estimating redshifts using only the spire fluxes .",
    "phase 1 coincides with the three equatorial fields of the galaxy and mass assembly , gama @xcite , spectroscopic survey .",
    "the fwhm beam sizes of the spire observations are 18@xmath17 , 25@xmath17 and 35@xmath17 for 250 , 350 and 500@xmath5 m respectively .",
    "@xcite describes the map - making procedure for the spire observations . to find the sources ,",
    "the madx algorithm @xcite was used on the maps that had been passed through a point spread function filter .",
    "the algorithm initially used the 250@xmath5 m map to find the positions of sources detected above 2.5@xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding fluxes from the 350 and 500@xmath5 m maps were then measured at these positions .",
    "if a source was detected at greater than 5@xmath16 in any of the three wavebands then it was listed as a detection , with 78,014 sources extracted in total .",
    "the 5@xmath16 sensitivities of the catalogues are 32 , 36 and 45 mjy for 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath18 m , respectively .",
    "the error on the flux , @xmath19 , is the combined instrumental and confusion noise with an additional 7% calibration error added in quadrature .",
    "the phase 1 _ herschel _ maps and catalogues will be described fully in valiante et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "the fields were chosen due to their lack of galactic cirrus ( though g09 does still contain a large amount of cirrus ) and large amount of complementary multi - wavelength data .",
    "however the lack of radio and mid - ir data meant counterparts were found directly by applying a likelihood ratio technique @xcite to objects in the sdss @xcite dr7 catalogue with a search radius of 10 . only optical objects matched with a reliability factor r@xmath2080% were considered as reliable matches .",
    "23,312 sources have reliable optical counterparts . for these",
    "there is photometry in _ ugriz _ and _ yjhk _ from the sdss and ukids large area survey @xcite , respectively , and fuv and nuv data from galex @xcite .",
    "12,136 sources also have spectroscopic redshifts available from the sdss , 6dfgs @xcite and 2slaq - qso / lrg @xcite surveys and from the gama catalogues @xcite .",
    "a further 10,972 photometric redshifts have been estimated from optical and near - ir photometry using the artificial neural network code ( annz ) @xcite .",
    "these redshift distributions are shown in fig [ figure : zdistopt ] . in fig",
    "[ figure : smithcomp ] sources without optical counterparts are shown to have slightly redder sub - mm colours , suggesting that they lie at higher redshifts than those with counterparts .",
    "we used fifteen h - atlas sources with redshifts from co observations to construct our template .",
    "these sources are listed in table [ table : harrisz ] .",
    "five of these are from @xcite , who measured co redshifts for sources with @xmath21mjy ; seven are from @xcite , who observed galaxies whose sub - mm emission peaked at 350@xmath5 m , indicating a high redshift ; one is from @xcite , who studied one of the brightest sources in the gama 15hr field , which has the peak of its emission at 500@xmath5 m ; and the remaining two are as yet unpublished redshifts from the h - atlas team .    the selection criteria for these follow - up observations picked out bright galaxies that were likely to be at high redshift and so only represent the most luminous high-@xmath12 galaxies .",
    "herschel _ colours of these galaxies are very red , which might introduce a bias towards colder objects .",
    "there is also a bias towards galaxies that are rich in co gas , since not all sources observed in the co programme were detected .",
    "many of these sources are likely to have been strongly lensed @xcite . as the gravitational magnification is likely to vary over a source it is possible that an unusually warm section of a galaxy might be magnified more strongly , boosting the flux at short wavelengths .",
    "however the dust detected at spire wavelengths is likely to be cool and evenly distributed throughout the galaxy and so the _ herschel _ colours are likely to remain reasonably unaffected and resulting temperatures can be taken as safe upper limits .",
    "to create the template we formed a sample of bright sources with accurately known redshifts . to do this we selected sources with either a redshift determined from the co observations , @xmath22 , or an optically determined redshift , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "in addition the flux must be greater than @xmath25mjy in at least one of the spire wavelengths .",
    "optically selected sources with @xmath26 are more likely to be quasars or atypical galaxies and so we did not use sources with optically determined redshifts above this reshift .",
    "the flux and redshift limits ensure we have a selection of high-@xmath12 sources for which we have accurate measurements of the seds .",
    "we excluded sources at @xmath27 for two reasons .",
    "first , these sources do not actually provide much extra information about the rest - frame _ herschel _ seds , because for low - redshift galaxies the spire colours depend very weakly on dust temperature .",
    "second , there is evidence from studies that combine the pacs and spire data for individual sources @xcite and from stacking analyses ( eales et al . in prep . ) that the seds of low - redshift and high - redshift herschel sources are quite different .",
    "these selection criteria produced a sample of 40 sources with known redshifts which are given in table [ table : harrisz ] : 15 sources with co redshifts and 25 sources with optical redshifts .",
    "there are actually many more sources in the redshift range @xmath28 with optical redshifts , but 25 were randomly chosen in order to prevent them from overwhelming the co sources .",
    "we assume that this sample is representative of the whole survey ; their redshifts and _ herschel _ colours are shown for comparison in figs [ figure : zdistopt ] and [ figure : smithcomp ] .",
    "the colours of this sample seem to be similar to those of sources with no optical counterpart .",
    "however , a possible bias may arise from the fact that all these sources are chosen to be bright and so will be among the most luminous h - atlas sources at their respective redshifts and so may not be representative of less luminous sources @xcite .",
    "we will use pacs data to test the dependence of dust temperature on luminosity in a later paper ( eales et al . in prep . ) .",
    "we then transform these sources to their rest - frame wavelengths as determined by their @xmath23 or @xmath22 , thus giving a range of flux measurements from @xmath29 m .",
    "we then fit our model , based upon a modified black body spectrum , consisting of two dust components each with a different temperature : @xmath30 \\label{eqn : sedfit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the flux at a rest - frame frequency @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a normalisation factor , @xmath34 is the planck function , @xmath35 is the dust emissivity index , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the temperatures of the hot and cold dust components , and @xmath38 is the ratio of the mass of cold dust to the mass of hot dust .",
    "a two temperature model is important because galaxies with high far - infrared luminosities are known to contain a cold dust component @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath39 because recent _ herschel _ observations of nearby galaxies suggest this is a typical value @xcite .",
    "the spire fluxes for the h - atlas sources do not give useful constraints on @xmath35 as they do not lie in the rayleigh - jeans region of the sed , where @xmath35 has the greatest effect .    for a given set of @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 the template",
    "was then fitted to the fluxes at their rest - frame wavelengths of all the sources within our sample .",
    "different intrinsic brightnesses and distances caused a large variation in flux between sources and so we introduced an additional normalisation factor , @xmath40 , for each source such that @xmath41 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the predicted flux of the @xmath43 source according to equation [ eqn : sedfit ] for the set of values being considered and @xmath44 is the measured flux and @xmath45 is the total error . for the @xmath43 source the measured fluxes and errors at all wavelengths",
    "are multiplied by @xmath40 , and then the difference from the flux predicted by the model is found .",
    "since the sources in our calibration sample are very bright , there are pacs measurements for many of them . in fitting the template , we used the pacs measurements for the sources as long as the rest - frame wavelength of the flux measurement was at @xmath4650@xmath5 m ; at shorter wavelengths there is likely to be significant emission from dust that is not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xmath47 is a sum over all 40 sources in the sample and over all available wavelengths .",
    "for each combination of @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 we found the values of @xmath40 that gave the minimum value of @xmath47 .",
    "our best - fit model was the set of @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 that gave the lowest value of @xmath47 overall , resulting in the template shown in figure [ figure : plottemplate ] and the values given in table [ table : jk ] .",
    "our best - fit model gives @xmath1k , @xmath2k with a ratio of cold to hot dust mass being 30.1 .",
    "for comparison we have also shown the seds of smm j2135 - 0102 ( @xmath48 ) and g15.141 ( @xmath49 ) in figure [ figure : templatecomp ] , as used in @xcite for estimating the redshifts of the sources in the h - atlas field observed during the _ herschel _ science demonstation phase ( sdp ) .",
    "all seds are normalised to the best values of @xmath40 given by our template as seen in figure [ figure : plottemplate ] .",
    "the template we find from the sample peaks at a slightly higher wavelength than that of those found in @xcite though the rayleigh - jeans region has very similar slope , most likely as both use @xmath39 for at least one of the dust components .",
    "when compared to the sed from @xcite , generated from spectroscopically selected hermes galaxies , the peak lies in a very similar position .",
    "the sed dervied by @xcite is controlled by a power law shortward of the peak to cover the mid - ir component , which is why is is so different from the other seds .",
    "however this region is well below the rest frame wavelength of sampled by our spire observations .",
    "it should be noted that the template is not expected to be a physically real sed but simply a statistical tool for estimating redshifts from spire fluxes .",
    "the peak of fig [ figure : plottemplate ] will represent the real sed of sources with @xmath50 , with the sed at longer wavelengths representing the real sed of h - atlas galaxies at lower redshift . in a later paper",
    "we will make a more detailed comparison of the seds of high - redshift h - atlas galaxies with low - redshift dusty galaxies .",
    "here we note that the average sed is quite similar to the two - temperature seds found by @xcite for luminous low - redshift dusty galaxies .      in order to test the accuracy of the redshifts determined from the template we used a jackknife technique . from the initial selection of 40 sources we created two subsets by listing the sources by redshift and alternately placing them into each subset .",
    "this ensured an even spread of redshifts and thus equal wavelength coverage .",
    "this was repeated twice more , this time splitting the sources randomly , resulting in three pairs of subsets from the initial data sample . for each subset",
    "we created a template as detailed in section [ sec : ctt ] .",
    "we then used the template to estimate the redshifts , @xmath51 , of the sources in the other sample from the pair . in estimating the redshifts the template was allowed to vary in redshift between @xmath52 with the minimum @xmath47 between the fluxes and the template giving the best estimate of @xmath51 .",
    "the temperatures and dust ratio values for the templates derived from the jackknife sets , as well as the values for the whole sample are shown in in table [ table : jk ] . to estimate the accuracy of the template derived from a set of sources , we calculate the value of @xmath53 for the sources in the other set from the pair ( or the whole sample when the template is derived from the whole sample ) , where @xmath23 is the best optical or co redshift .",
    "fig [ figure : zvsz ] shows the estimates from all three jackknife pairs .",
    "the mean and root mean squared ( rms ) values for each template are shown in table [ table : jk ] . for comparison we have also used the two seds used in @xcite to estimate the redshifts of the sources in our sample ."
