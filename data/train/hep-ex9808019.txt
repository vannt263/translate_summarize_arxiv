    ". a comparison of the inclusive hadronic decay rate of the  with qcd predictions can give fundamental parameters of the theory . the energy regime governed by @xmath54",
    "is regarded as a compromise region between the low and high energy regimes where non - perturbative and perturbative qcd dominate , respectively .",
    "in fact ,  decay is probably the lowest - energy process from which the coupling constant @xmath55 can be cleanly extracted @xcite without large complications from non - perturbative effects , while the perturbative expansion still converges well .    in this analysis",
    "the most important quantity to measure is the strong coupling constant @xmath56 .",
    "the running  of @xmath55 , for energy scales smaller than @xmath57 , can be tested with the integrated differential decay rate into hadrons @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the mass of the final - state hadronic system and @xmath60 is the hadronic decay width of the tau normalized to the decay width of the tau going into electron and neutrinos .",
    "this is possible as the hadronic decay rate @xmath61 depends on the strong coupling constant @xmath62 at the scale @xmath63 only , where @xmath63 denotes the upper integration limit for the integral over @xmath58 .",
    "the measured @xmath56 can be transformed into a value for @xmath3 through the renormalization group equation ( @xmath64-function ) . in doing that , the relative error of @xmath65 decreases like the decrease of @xmath65 itself .",

    "hence , the significance of this measurement compares favorably with other @xmath3 determination methods  @xcite .",
    "inclusive observables like the hadronic decay rate @xmath8  have been calculated in perturbative qcd to @xmath68 .",
    "some remaining theoretical uncertainties due to corrections in powers of @xmath69 can be avoided if the differential decay rate @xmath58 is measured and compared to the theory by means of its spectral moments which are weighted integrals over @xmath58 . as a result",
    ", the power corrections and @xmath55 can be simultaneously determined from a fit . while @xmath70 can be precisely determined from the leptonic branching ratios and the  lifetime , @xmath58 involves a measurement of the invariant mass of the hadronic system .",
    "thus , an exclusive reconstruction of all hadronic final states in  decays is necessary .    in this paper",
    "an analysis is presented using data taken with the opal detector at lep at energies within @xmath71 of the   peak .",
    "the analysis includes measurements of the differential decay rates @xmath72 for vector ( v ) and axial - vector ( a ) decays and their respective spectral moments . using these moments , fits of qcd predictions",
    "are made extracting the strong coupling constant @xmath56 and parameters of the non - perturbative expansion , most notably the contributions of dimension 6 and 8 operators .",
    "the measurement is based on a set of spectral moments defined by the same weighting functions used by aleph  @xcite and cleo  @xcite .",
    "the differential decay rates themselves can be re - expressed in terms of spectral functions of the vector and axial - vector current , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this measurement serves for saturation tests of qcd sum rules at the -mass scale by comparing the experimental values of the sum rules with chiral qcd predictions .",

    "the functions @xmath85 are proportional to the spectral functions for the non - strange currents with angular momenta @xmath86 and @xmath87 as indicated by the superscripts .",
    "the latter spectral function vanishes for the vector current , since no scalar particle has been observed in @xmath88 decays , while @xmath89 is given by the pion pole , assuming that the pion is the only pseudo - scalar final - state in non - strange   decays : @xmath90 with @xmath91 being the number of selected  decays into pions .",

    "these two rates are identical and add up to the number of colors .",
    "since only non - strange currents are considered in this work the nave expectation has to be multiplied by @xmath95 . including the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions , equation ( [ eq : rkl ] ) is usually written as @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the same multiplicative correction as in equation  ( [ eq : drds ] ) and @xmath98 are additive electroweak corrections .",
    "the latter has been calculated for @xmath99 only  @xcite yielding @xmath100 . in the higher moments",
    "it is assumed that this term scales with the integral over the weight functions in equations  ( [ eq : drds ] ) and  ( [ eq : rkl ] ) like the @xmath101 correction : @xmath102 therefore the @xmath98 contribution to the moments is small ( @xmath103 ) and the uncertainty due to this term is neglected in the analysis .",
    "the other factors in equation  ( [ eq : rklqcd ] ) are explained in more detail below .      the perturbative term @xmath104 is known to third order in @xmath0  @xcite and partly known to fourth order in @xmath0  @xcite . for @xmath105 and @xmath7 it is : @xmath106 this result which truncates after the fourth power of @xmath0  is refered to as fixed order perturbation theory ( fopt ) .",
    "different attempts have been made to obtain a resummation of some of the higher order terms .",
    "the resummation scheme proposed in  @xcite compensates for higher order logarithmic terms in @xmath0  by expressing the @xmath107 terms by contour - integrals in the complex @xmath80-plane along the circle @xmath108 and solving numerically for each @xmath65 along the circle ( contour - improved perturbation theory , cipt ) .",
    "the different @xmath65 values on the circle can be calculated from @xmath56 by solving numerically the @xmath64-function : @xmath109 with @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114  @xcite for @xmath115 quark flavors .",
    "the last two coefficients are renormalization scheme dependent and the quoted values belong to the @xmath116-scheme .",

    "expanding the perturbative corrections in terms of cipt gives : @xmath119 where the functions @xmath120 are the weighted contour integrals .",
    "for @xmath105 the function is : @xmath121 in the @xmath116-scheme and for three flavors the first four terms are : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124  @xcite .",

    "similar estimates are given in @xcite .",
    "a central value of @xmath126 is used , with an uncertainty of @xmath127 in the perturbative expansions for cipt and fopt .",
    "another major theoretical uncertainty is the choice of renormalization scale @xmath128 in the @xmath0  dependence of @xmath129 .",

    "the non - perturbative contributions are expressed as a power series in terms of @xmath69 absorbing the long - distance dynamics into vacuum matrix elements @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "thus , they can be written as sums over power corrections of different dimensions , @xmath138 : @xmath139 in contrast to the perturbative part described in the previous section the power corrections differ for the vector and the axial - vector currents .    in equation  ( [ eq : nonpert ] ) the correction of dimension",
    "@xmath140 is a mass correction term and therefore belongs to the perturbative part .",
    "the @xmath141 term is the first term with major non - perturbative contributions , namely the quark condensates for the three light flavors @xmath142 and the gluon condensate @xmath143 .",
    "if one neglects the small @xmath80-dependence of the power corrections , the @xmath144 terms can be expressed for all @xmath145 values by a product of the same ( vector / axial - vector ) operator of dimension @xmath138 ( or the power correction for @xmath99 ) and a simple integral over the @xmath145-dependent weight - functions  @xcite : @xmath146 where each entry in the matrix belongs to a particular dimension  @xmath138 and a particular moment @xmath145 , as denoted by the first row and the last column .",
    "the parameter @xmath147 is an arbitrary factorization scale which separates the long - distance non - perturbative effects , which are absorbed in the vacuum matrix elements @xmath148 , from short - distance perturbative effects which are incorporated in the wilson coefficients @xmath149  @xcite .",

    "the least precisely known @xmath141 parameter , the gluon condensate , which is known only to @xmath153 @xcite , is also taken as a free parameter in the fit , while the @xmath140 term is calculated from the quark masses and the strong coupling .",
    "terms with dimensions higher then @xmath154 are neglected in this analysis as they do not contribute to @xmath155 as can be seen from equation  ( [ eq : ope ] ) .",

    "multihadrons are removed from the sample by requiring two narrow jets ( cones with a half opening angle of @xmath177 ) and up to six tracks in the event .",
    "the events from two - photon processes are eliminated by allowing an acollinearity angle of up to @xmath178 between the two jets .",

    "the most important observable for the discrimination between vector and axial - vector channels is the number of neutral pions in a cone .",
    "a new method to reconstruct neutral pions in  decays has been employed , which is described in the following section .",
    "neutral pions are identified by their decay into two photons . since photons are only detected in the ecal , an iterative fit of photon energies and directions to the observed energy deposits in the ecal blocks is performed .",
    "the energy deposition in an ecal block can be expressed as a function of the photon energy and the photon direction .",
    "this is done by parameterizing the integrated energy density of an electromagnetic shower for each ecal block . in the barrel region of the ecal where the blocks have a quasi - pointing geometry only lateral shower profiles need",

    "the longitudinal profile is reasonably described by the gamma distribution  @xcite .",
    "the mean energy deposit of a minimum ionizing particle is subtracted from all ecal blocks hit by a charged particle .",
    "the fit then finds the smallest number of photons needed to explain the measured energies and provides their corresponding three - vectors .",
    "energy depositions from hadronic interactions of charged pions in the ecal are accounted for by assigning photon candidates which are close to track intersections with the ecal to the track .",
    "the maximum angle allowed between a photon candidate and a track to which the photon candidate can be assigned depends on the polar angle of the track and varies between @xmath208 and @xmath209 in the barrel region and between @xmath210 and @xmath211 in the endcap region . a photon candidate close to a track",
    "is still classified as a photon if the total energy of photon candidates assigned to this track exceeds the measured track momentum .",
    "all possible two - photon combinations are then used to find   candidates .",
    "the combination resulting in the largest number of   candidates with an average invariant mass deviation from the  mass less than @xmath212 is selected .",
    "the error on the invariant two - photon mass , @xmath213 , is calculated from the error matrices of the above photon fit .",
    "the  four - momenta are then calculated from the energies and directions of the photon pairs of the selected combination after a constrained fit to the  mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : pi0 ] shows the photon - pair mass for selected  candidates before the -mass constraint .",
    "for all the one - prong modes a minimum energy of @xmath214 for each reconstructed  is required while @xmath215 is required in the three - prong modes to suppress fake s introduced by the energy deposition of charged pions in the ecal .",
    "the granularity of the ecal allows the reconstruction of both photons from a  only if its energy is below @xmath216 .",
    "the s with larger energies have photons which are merged in the ecal .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : unf1 ] ) can be simplified to a matrix equation of the form : @xmath225 this is performed in two steps .",
    "first , the true distribution @xmath219 is parameterized with a set of @xmath226 parameters @xmath227 and @xmath226 basis functions @xmath228 which are defined below in equation  ( [ eq : bsplines ] ) : @xmath229 with @xmath230 being the generated monte carlo distribution . by defining : @xmath231 equation  ( [ eq : unf1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath232 in the second step , @xmath220 , @xmath223 and @xmath233 are represented by @xmath234 bins : @xmath235 the basis functions @xmath228 used in equations  ( [ eq : discret1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ajy ] ) are chosen as cubic b - splines and thus have the following form : @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the distance between adjacent knots @xmath238 for @xmath239 knots and @xmath226 splines .",

    "unfolding produces results with unphysical behavior .",
    "statistically insignificant components of the fitted coefficient vector @xmath244 can lead to large oscillations of the unfolded distribution .",

    "the value of equation  ( [ eq : i3 ] ) at @xmath7 is : @xmath531 where the error covers all experimental uncertainties .      assuming that the dmo sum rule shown in figure  [ fig : sum_rules ]  ( c ) is already saturated at the -mass scale , its value can be used to predict the electric polarizability of the charged pion as proposed in  @xcite : @xmath532 using the result from the previous section for the dmo sum rule ( equation  ( [ eq : i3_result ] ) ) one gets : @xmath533 which is in good agreement with the value @xmath534 , derived in  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the spectral functions of the vector current and the axial - vector current and their applications in qcd have been presented . within the framework of the operator product expansion , a simultaneous determination of the strong coupling constant @xmath0   and non - perturbative correction terms has been performed .",
    "the sum of @xmath497 and @xmath498 was found to involve a large cancellation of the non - perturbative terms and thus has been used together with the @xmath88 lifetime and the branching ratio @xmath535 to give a precise measurement of the strong coupling constant .",
    "cipt has led to the value @xmath536 at the -mass scale and @xmath537 at the -mass scale , where the first error stems from the experimental uncertainties and the second error originates from the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath3 using fopt or rcpt are @xmath4 and @xmath5 smaller , respectively .",
    "the total amount of non - perturbative corrections to @xmath497 ( @xmath498 ) was found to be @xmath538 ( @xmath539 ) , while the correction on the sum of @xmath497 and @xmath498 due to non - perturbative qcd is found to be only @xmath540 . here",
    "the errors include all experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "assuming the validity of the operator product expansion for energy scales below the  mass a test of the running  of the strong coupling between @xmath541 and @xmath542 has been performed .",
    "a good agreement between the predicted running  from the @xmath543-loop @xmath64-function and the fitted @xmath55 values has been observed for cipt .",
    "the saturation of qcd sum rules at the -mass scale has been tested , yielding a measurement of the pion polarizability of @xmath544 as determined from the dmo sum rule .",
