    "the context of the localization phenomena addressed by p.w . anderson in 1958 was the understanding of the conductivity of electrons in solids .",
    "in particular , anderson studied the diffusion of a single particle traveling in an infinite disordered lattice in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "as a consequence of the coherent back scattering process not only the phase , but also the amplitude of the single particle wave function becomes affected .",
    "the main result of such seminal work , was to demonstrate that localization or absence of diffusion occurs for critical values of the disorder strength , being the most distinctive signature of such phenomena the exponentially decaying behavior of the single particle wave function envelope . later in 1974 , thouless considered the role of the system size and established a correspondence among the conductivity , the energy spectrum and the system size .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to the influence that disorder and scaling , namely dimensionality and size , have in determining the conductance properties in a macroscopic material , another unavoidable aspect present in real solids are the interactions between particles , that even in the low temperature regime , dramatically modify the behavior of the transport properties . in 1949",
    "n. mott @xcite showed that when correlations between electrons become strong in presumably metallic systems , half - filled energy bands appear transforming metallic systems into insulators .",
    "although there is an extensive literature dealing with transport and localization phenomena @xcite , still open questions remain regarding dimensionality against interactions .        now a days ultracold neutral gases are perhaps the most simplified scenario to address the study of transport properties , compared to their analogous electrically charged particles within the condensed matter scheme .",
    "as it is well known , each aspect intervening in either dynamical and stationary properties may be externally controlled in the case of neutral atoms .",
    "superfluid - mott insulating transition and anderson localization phenomena have been experimentally tested in fermionic @xcite and bosonic @xcite systems loaded in optical lattices , and more recently , the interplay of disorder and many body interactions has been analyzed in a bose gas confined in a two dimensional space @xcite .",
    "in particular , the impediment towards equilibrium caused by disorder and many body interactions was investigated in that experiment . from the theoretical perspective",
    "there is also an extensive amount of literature addressing the study of transport in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the standard schemes used to describe the referred transitions are the extended full quantum bose - hubbard ( ebh ) model and the hybrid ebh model within the decoupling approach .",
    "however , due to the degeneracy associated to dimensionality and number of particles , the size of hilbert space grows enormously , thus making impracticable to deal with .",
    "therefore another descriptions circumventing the many body problem must be used .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation is precisely the most suitable scheme to describe the ground state of a weakly interacting bose gas .",
    "despite that fact that fluctuations in the number of particles are always poissonian in gp calculations , such a mean field approach allow us to investigate either stationary or dynamical transport properties in superfluids away from the regime of insulating states , such as a mott insulator .    in this work",
    "we study the localization phenomena in a gas of interacting bose atoms confined in disordered square and triangular lattices in two dimensions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the gas being in its condensate phase is described through gp equation . in particular ,",
    "we determine the stationary states as a function of the disorder magnitude for a fixed value of the two - body contact interaction . from the analysis of the stationary density profiles we calculate the average localization length and the energy spectrum as a function of disorder .",
    "our mean field study allowed us to reach the conclusion that localization phenomena is indeed present in two dimensional systems , being the triangular geometry favorable against the square one in attaining exponentially localized states .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the system model and set the parameters used for the calculations . in section 3 , from the stationary density profiles ,",
    "we determine the average localization length as a function of the disorder for both geometries square and triangular . in section 4",
    "we analyze the energy spectrum and found that associated to the disorder present in the finite size lattices , the discrete levels levels acquire a finite width . finally in section 5 a summary of this work",
    "the system under study consist of an interacting gas of bosonic atoms confined in a two dimensional lattice , subjected to a static random disorder . in fig . [ fig1 ] we illustrate a realization of disorder in a square lattice . to model the interactions between particles we assume onsite contact interactions scaled through the effective interaction strength @xmath0 that is written in terms of the @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 and the atomic mass @xmath3 .",
    "as it is well known , this approximation is valid at sufficiently low temperatures , low densities and weak interactions . to analyze the effect of the disorder in the interacting bose gas",
    ", we consider gp equation ,    @xmath4    for the amplitude of the interacting bose gas . in this equation @xmath5",
    "is the total number of particles composing the condensate and the potential .",
    "@xmath6 is given by a two dimensional disordered lattice with square or triangular symmetry ,    @xmath7    where the parameter @xmath8 is a random quantity varying in the interval @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 .",
    "namely , the disorder in the square and triangular lattices is created by randomly varying its amplitude . for our calculations we used @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to stress that this way of setting disorder through the lattice resembles the original treatment made by anderson , that is , considering an energetic random disorder .",
    "nevertheless disordered potentials can be experimentally created by combining the light pattern of a standing wave having square or triangular symmetry together with the light arising from an optical speckle field produced when a laser beam passes through a diffusing plate .",
    "such technique produces spatially random disorder that also originates localized states .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in real experiments , besides the disordered optical lattice confinement , the atoms typically move under the influence of a harmonic confinement @xmath12 .",
    "we note that such a contribution can also be considered in our gp analysis to investigate the modifications introduced the inhomogeneity .",
    "for our analysis we shall consider typical parameters of @xmath13rb atoms @xcite confined in an optical lattice potential having a depths of @xmath14 and a lattice spacing @xmath15 nm , where @xmath16 the recoil energy .. other natural scale for the energy is given in terms of the nearest neighbor tunneling energy @xmath17}$ ] .",
    "] regarding the onsite interaction energy between pairs of particles we assume that the @xmath1-wave scattering length takes a fixed value @xmath18 nm . the value of the disorder that we shall consider for our calculations is between 5 and 30 percent of the optical lattice depth .",
    "in this section we study the stationary states of equation ( [ gpe ] ) as a function of the disorder strength @xmath8 for a fixed value of the interaction coefficient @xmath19 for both square and triangular lattices .",
    "that is , we solve numerically the time independent gp equation for several values of the disorder and determine the density profile to investigate the existence of localized states . for this purpose",
    "we consider lattices of size @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and 25 in the case of square lattices , and @xmath22 and 126 sites in the case of triangular lattices . in order to have meaningful quantities in terms of the disorder amplitude , for a given size of the lattice @xmath23",
    ", we consider sets of 30 realizations of random numbers for each value @xmath24 .",
    "that is , for a given disorder amplitude @xmath24 the lattice amplitude at each point changes in the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "each of the analyzed quantities is the result of the average over the 30 realizations . to illustrate the effect of the disorder in figs .",

    "we identify such states as those whose stationary density profile @xmath32 is composed of exponentially localized peaks of the form @xmath33 $ ] , being @xmath34 the localization length and @xmath35 and @xmath36 the lattice size positions ( see the density profiles illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "that is , the center of the peaks coincide with the positions of the lattice . for a given value of the disorder strength",
    "the fraction of peaks is constant on average , that is , different realizations of disorder having the same disorder amplitude , produce the same fraction of peaks . to determine the localization length we average , as stated above , over 30 different realizations for a given disorder amplitude and a given lattice size .",
    "it is found that although several peaks in a given realization have variable height , its localization length is the same .",
    "[ fig4 ] summarize the results obtained for square and triangular lattices .",
    "there , we plot the average localization length scaled in units of lattice constant @xmath37 as a function of the disorder amplitude @xmath8 in units of recoil energy @xmath16 .",
    "black and red circles correspond to square and triangular lattices respectively . to ensure that the underlying geometry was not destroyed , and thus have meaningful predictions ,",
    "the maximum value of disorder strength used in our calculations did not exceed 30 percent of the optical depth @xmath38 .",
    "namely , we restricted or analysis to values of @xmath8 in the interval @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "it is found that the value of the average localization length in the case of triangular lattice is smaller than that of a square lattice .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the coordination number of the system .",
    "the number of nearest neighbors is larger in the triangular case ( @xmath40 ) with respect to the square lattice ( @xmath41 ) , thus the difference in topology of the lattices induces a change in mobility between the atoms .",
    "as there are more neighbors to each density peak there is a local compression effect , leading to a smaller mean localization length . as the disorder amplitude @xmath8",
    "is further increased , the average of the localization length reaches a stationary value in both lattice topologies , see fig.[fig4 ] .     as a function of disorder for square ( black circles ) and triangular ( red circles ) lattices .",
    "localization length and disorder are in units of lattice constant @xmath37 and recoil energy @xmath16.,width=316 ]    to complement our analysis we investigate the effect of harmonic confinement in disordered lattices .",
    "we found that exponentially localized states appear at the center of the lattice , that is , peaks surrounding the origin of the harmonic trap become visible , for values of disorder strength smaller than those at which localization occurs in the absence harmonic confinement . as the value of the harmonic frequency is increased , the number of peaks at the center diminish , until just one peak remain for meaningful values of the harmonic frequency . summarizing , harmonic confinement works together with disorder to produce localization at the center of the trap",
    "in this section we investigate the energy spectrum of the stationary states analyzed above .",
    "to proceed we consider the energy associated to the stationary gp equation as a function of the disorder strength @xmath8 and a fixed value of the mean field interaction @xmath42 ,    @xmath43   \\psi(r ) + \\frac{g}{2 }   | \\psi(r)|^4 \\right \\},\\ ] ]    being the disorder included in the expression for square and triangular lattices @xmath44 , @xmath45 written above .",

    "[ fig5 ] we show , in the reciprocal space , density plots of the energy spectra for two values of disorder , for either , square and triangular lattices .",
    "it is important to point out that the information displayed in this panel can be compared with direct experimental measurements .",
    "we observe from this panel that the main effect of disorder on the energy spectrum is that structure become visible compared with the case of no disorder",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] summarize the full energy spectra as a function of the disorder strength for square and triangular lattices respectively . as can be appreciated from those figures the finite size of the two dimensional lattices produce energy levels having a level width .",
