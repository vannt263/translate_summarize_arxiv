    "julian barbour proposed a scaled _ relational particle mechanics ( rpm ) _ in 1982 with bruno bertotti bb82 @xcite and a pure - shape rpm in 2003 @xcite .",
    "these implement both temporal relationalism and spatial relationalism @xcite in senses that are in accord with leibniz and mach s critiques of newtonian mechanics as explained in sec 2 .",
    "moreover , spatial relationalism was implemented indirectly in barbour s formulations of these rpm s , i.e. at the level of unreduced actions . a natural further question",
    "then is what is the specific geometry of these theories reduced configuration spaces ?",
    "i began to study this question from first principles in @xcite , but subsequently found that david kendall s theory of _ shape geometry _",
    "( sec 3 ) @xcite already covered this in far greater generality in the pure - shape case .",
    "kendall s work was in fact done in an entirely different context from mechanics : the _ statistical _ theory of shape .",
    "nevertheless , his underlying notion of shape coincides with @xcite that used in barbour s pure - shape rpm . additionally , the cone ( in the sense explained in sec 3 ) over kendall s pure - shape geometry turns out to be the reduced configuration space for the scaled rpm @xcite .",
    "overall , the procedure for constructing a mechanics from a given geometry @xcite to kendall s geometry ( or the cone thereover ) coincides with the reduction of barbour s mechanics theories , as outlined in sec 4 .",
    "sec 5 then supplies further motivation for barbour s rpm s from their analogies with gr @xcite .",
    "these include rpms manifesting a number of gr s background independent aspects @xcite and the consequent facets of the problem of time in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "sec 6 then considers one approach to resolving the problem of time which barbour has also worked on @xcite : the hitherto rather speculative timeless records theory ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "i then explain ( secs 7 to 10 ) a new theoretical observation : that kendall s own further application of shape geometry ",
    "shape statistics @xcite  can furthermore be applied to the rpm case of records theory itself .",
    "this is a promising indication of how to render records theory a quantitative subject more generally .",
    "kendall for instance used shape statistics to determine whether the locations of the standing stones at land s end in cornwall contained more alignments than could be put down to to random chance .",
    "he approached this by the method of sampling in threes , with the probability distribution functions used being based on the geometry of the shape space for the three particles .",
    "he also applied such shape statistics in a more physical setting , involving assessing the supposed evidence for quasars being aligned .",
    "is that that there is no meaningful time for the universe as a whole @xcite as a desirable tenet of background - independence and of closed universes .",
    "this admits the following mathematically sharp implementation .",
    "\\i ) the action is to neither include any extraneous times  such as newtonian time  nor any extraneous time - like variables ( such as the lapse @xcite in the case of gr ) .",
    "\\ii ) time is not to be smuggled into the action in the guise of a label either .",
    "this is attained by postulating _",
    "geometrical jacobi type actions _",
    "s = s ; [ sj ] these so happen to be manifestly parametrization - irrelevant .",
    "here s : = ||q|| _ [ 2 ] is the kinetic arc element  the geometry on the configuration space @xmath0 of the possible values of the configurations @xmath1 .",
    "this has a metric @xmath2 with components @xmath3 , which is riemannian ( positive - definite ) for mechanics .",
    "also the potential factor @xmath4 for mechanics is @xmath5 , for potential @xmath6 and total energy @xmath7 .    a distinguished time that simplifies both @xcite the equation of motion and the change ",
    "momentum relation ( relational analogue of velocity - momentum relation @xcite ) then emerges .",
    "its form is t^ = s/ . via ( [ 2 ] ) and @xmath8 being a notion of change ,",
    "this clearly implements mach s ` time is to be abstracted from change ' resolution of primary - level timelessness .",
    "moreover , this implementation is such that all changes are given an opportunity to contribute @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) * configurational relationalism * @xcite is that one can take into account the physical irrelevance of a continuous group of transformations @xmath9 acting on the system s configuration space @xmath0 . for mechanics , these are usually translations and rotations of space , though in general configurational relationalism also covers physically irrelevant internal transformations , as in the most common types of gauge theory .",
    "an indirect implementation of configurational relationalism is _ best matching _ : bringing two configurations into minimum incongruence with each other by application of @xmath9 s group action .",
    "then taking into account the linear constraints ensuing from variation with respect to the auxiliary @xmath9-variables sends one to the relationally - desired quotient space @xmath10 .",
    "one is to use a cyclic differential presentation @xmath11 for the auxiliary @xmath9-variables @xcite if this implementation of configurational relationalism is to be compatible with the above implementation of temporal relationalism .",

    "kendall then furthermore used the definition that ( n , d ) : = ( n , d)/(d ) ; note that this coincides with pure - shape rpm s reduced configuration space .",
    "moreover , some of these shape spaces have highly tractable mathematics : they are very straightforwardly spheres @xmath24 spheres for 1-@xmath12 , and , as kendall demonstrated , @xcite , complex projective spaces @xmath25 for 2-@xmath12 .",

    "study metric @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath27 , rendering triangleland considerably simpler to study than any larger @xmath22-a - gonland . then in this case",
    ", one has not only tractable geometry and methods of mathematical physics , but also kendall s spherical blackboard : fig [ blackboard].a ) .",
    "i then defined ( n , d ) : = ( n , d)/(d ) ; this also coincides with scaled rpm s configuration space .",
    "the geometry of this is , moreover , the cone over the above shape space @xcite.[multiblock footnote omitted ] this further simplifies for the @xmath22-stop metroland case via c@xmath28 both topologically and metrically .",
    "there is no such simplification for @xmath22-a - gonlands except for triangleland , though that case is not flat ( but is conformally flat ) .",
    "finally , a consequence of the cone structure is that pure - shape problems occur as subproblems in models with scale .",
    "thus considering kendall s pure - shape case turned out to be key to solving barbour s scaled rpm also .",
    "carry out to completion the relevant set of moves in fig 3 on the jacobi arc elements ( [ s - scale ] ) and ( [ s - ps ] ) in 1- and 2-@xmath12 for arbitrary @xmath22 to obtain barbour s rpm in reduced form : the explicit end - product of best matching .",
    "apply the jacobi ",
    "synge approach @xcite  which involves building a natural mechanics from a given metric geometry  to kendall s shape spaces and to the cone over these .",
    "i previously showed that these procedures coincide @xcite ; i term this the _ direct = best - matched theorem _",
    "after the two types of implementation of configurational relationalism .",
    "thus indeed kendall s work  and its straightforward extension by coning  amounts to having already derived the detailed topological and metric structure of the reduced configuration spaces for barbour s rpm s .",
    "this greatly strengthened the rpm program @xcite .",
    "note that this coincidence of procedures was by no means guaranteed .",
    "for instance , bookstein @xcite gave a distinct metric geometry on the space of shapes .",
    "i did not study mechanics corresponding to this geometry because it gives material significance to the plane figures themselves , in the form of a ` resistance to crushing ' criterion .",
    "contrast with how relational mechanics considers the constellation of points itself to be the primary entity .",
    "also barbour s best matching is a procedure that bears much conceptual similarity to the procrustes procedure of shape geometry @xcite ; however these each involve extremizing a different object .",
    "motivation 1 ) rpm s are analogous to various significant formulations of gr .",
    "1.i ) wheeler s _ geometrodynamics _ is gr as a dynamical system in which the evolving entities are spatial 3-geometries .",
    "this is governed by the @xcite has determinant @xmath29 , inverse @xmath30 , covariant derivative @xmath31 , ricci scalar @xmath32 and conjugate momentum @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the dewitt supermetric @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the cosmological constant . ] : = _ abcd^ab^cd - \\ { - 2 } = 0 [ hamm ] _ i : = - 2_j^j_i = 0 .",
    "[ momm ] these are analogous to scaled rpm s @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively ( @xmath39 is rather trivial to remove ) .",
    "1.ii ) _ conformogeometrodynamics _ is geometrodynamics further reformulation in terms of conformal mathematics .",
    "this has the virtue of decoupling @xmath40 from @xmath41 , and is then the centrepiece of the initial value problem formulation of gr @xcite .",
    "this formulation requires a maximal or cmc slice , given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the first of these is furthermore analogous to pure - shape rpm s @xmath44 .    motivation 2 ) moreover , rpm s model a number of aspects of background independence @xcite and of the subsequent problem of time in quantum gravity @xcite and in quantum cosmology in particular @xcite , including exhibiting various further closed - universe effects @xcite .",
    "2.i ) temporal and configurational relationalism as described in sec 2 are two aspects of background independence that are indeed also manifested by gr .",
    "the minisuperspace case of gr  the restriction to homogeneous spatial metrics  can indeed be cast in terms of an action of form ( [ sj ] ) , except that now ( [ 2 ] ) is a semi - riemannian ( indefinite ) geometry @xcite and @xmath45 for gr . in the case of full gr , the redundant configuration space @xmath0 = riem(@xmath46 ) : the space of riemannian metrics on a 3-space of fixed topology @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath9 = diff(@xmath46 )  the corresponding spatial 3-diffeomorphisms  are to be used in the case of geometrodynamics . implementing configurational relationalism with respect to these by best",
    "matching gives e.g. the baierlein ",
    "wheeler action @xcite if the shift auxiliary variable is used , or further actions @xcite if temporal relationalism is to be implemented in tandem with this .",
    "these are still of the general form ( [ sj ] ) , except that now integration over space is required in addition to the above interpretations of ( [ 2 ] ) and @xmath4 carrying over .",
    "then @xmath40 arises from configurational relationalism as a minor variant on the usual manner @xcite in which diff(@xmath46 ) leads to @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath41 usually arises in gr from variation with respect to the lapse .",
    "this working has to change , since lapse no longer exists in the relational approach at the primary level .",
    "what happens is that relational actions for gr none the less make up for this non - existence , by @xmath41 arising from them as a primary constraint instead , in parallel to how @xmath37 arises in rpm s .",
    "if one chooses instead @xmath9 = conf(@xmath46 ) @xmath13 diff(@xmath46 ) or vpconf(@xmath46 ) @xmath13 diff(@xmath46 )  where conf(@xmath46 ) are the conformal transformations and vpconf(@xmath46 ) are the global volume - preserving conformal transformations  conformogeometrodynamical formulations or theories ensue .",
    "pure - shape rpm s constraint @xmath44 is furthermore then analogous to conformogeometrodynamics maximal slice condition .",
    "2.ii ) furthermore , relational approach additionally leads to new derivations of both 1.i ) and 1.ii ) when applied to gr @xcite , and to various alternative theories and formulations of gravitational theory @xcite .",
    "some of the workings involved in this have rpm analogues @xcite .",
    "2.iii ) the corresponding gr configuration spaces are the following quotient spaces .",
    "wheeler s , ( ) : = ( ) / ( ) diff ( ) , and the adjunction to the latter of a solitary global volume degree of freedom @xmath47 to form @xmath48 .",
    "compare sec 3 for rpm analogues ; moreover these gr configuration spaces are considerably harder to model than their 1- and 2-@xmath12 counterparts , rendering them useful model arenas .",
    "in particular , cs(@xmath46 ) is gr s own version of shape space : the space of conformal 3-geometries , whereas \\{cs + v}(@xmath46 ) and superspace(@xmath46 ) are globally and locally scaled counterparts of this respectively .",
    "finally note that 2-@xmath12 suffices to have a very comprehensive analogy with spatially 3-@xmath12 gr @xcite .",
    "3-@xmath12 shape geometry is much harder @xcite and for very different reasons that gr s own difficulties . in this way ,",
    "3-@xmath12 rpm is _ far less _ suitable as a productive model arena for gr @xcite than 1- and 2-@xmath12 rpm are .",
    "2.iv ) the most well - known facet of the problem of time is the frozen formalism problem , a common phrasing for which is that the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation  the quantum wave equation = 0 for each whole - universe gr model  is stationary , i.e. frozen alias timeless . through possessing eq ( [ e ] ) ,",
    "rpm s clearly also exhibit a frozen quantum wave equation , = 0",
    ". moreover , the problem of time is multi - faceted @xcite , with rpm s exhibiting around 2/3rds of these @xcite .",
    "one strategy then for dealing with this unexpected frozenness ( and the problem of time more generally ) is to take it at face value and see how much physics one can still do .",
    "dynamics or history are now to be _ apparent notions _ to be constructed from the instant @xcite",
    ". this amounts to supplanting ` becoming ' with ` being ' at the primary level . `",
    "being at a time ' is a simpler case to supplant with just ` being ' .",
    "this is by replacing it by correlations within a single instant between the configuration under study and another that constitutes the ` hands of the clock ' .",
    "supplanting ` becoming ' itself is more involved @xcite from a practical perspective .",
    "theoreticians have differed somewhat both in how to render the notion of timeless records more precise , and in how they envisage the semblance of dynamics may come about .",
    "thus there are in fact a number of distinct timeless records approaches @xcite . the particular version i consider is as follows at the classical level .    ) .",
    "records are information - containing subconfigurations of a single instant that are localized both in space and in configuration space .",
    "this is partly so that they are accurately known and partly so that there can be more than one such to compare .",
    "for these reasons , barbour s own insistence on whole - universe configurations is dropped .    .",
    "records are furthermore required to contain useful information . in this way , such as information theory and pattern recognition are thus relevant precursors to records theory .    .",
    "this is ` ratios of relative separations ' information , which can already be modelled by particles in 1-@xmath12 .",
    "this has the further advantages of involving more detailed information which can be attributed locally and to subsystems . in this manner",
    ", clumping statistics can be used to assess the significance of more detailed aspects of patterns , as well as applying to localized subconfigurations in the context of records theory .",
    "e.g. roach @xcite provided a discrete statistical study of clumping ; this can in turn be interpreted in terms of coarse - grainings of rpm configurations .",
    "also note that the previous sec s fitting a line concerns relative angle information between the points in the constellation , in distinction to ratios of relative separations information .",
    "these are two distinct types of shape information . moreover , in 1-@xmath12 , only the latter type of shape information exists .",
    "thus 1-@xmath12 rpm s can be used to study ratios of relative separations information _ in isolation from _ @xcite the more complicated assessment of relative angle information . on the other hand ,",
    "2-@xmath12 rpm s suffice to exhibit both , in fact in a 1 : 1 proportion .",
    "this follows most readily from the @xmath49 presentation underlying the @xmath50 having one independent ratio information magnitude per independent relative angle phase .",
    "moreover , the previous sec s approach is but one particular case of assessing relative angle information , and one which uses the whole data set rather than localized subconfigurations .",
    "a more general and detailed method for assessing relative angle information , which furthermore focuses on subconfigurations , is laid out in the next section .",
    "indeed , seeking a single regression line for the best fit of a whole data set as in sec 7 is not always appropriate .",
    "this is made clear by the study of the distribution of standing stones or quasars . here",
    ", one is to consider more sophisticated geometrical propositions about @xmath22-a - gon constellations .",
    "e.g. assessing whether there is a disproportionate number of approximately - collinear triples of points  a more detailed relative angle information criterion and indeed tied to subconfigurations .",
    "this is addressed by sampling in threes .",
    "the standing stones problem was first posed as a problem of this kind to be addressed by geometrical statistics by broadbent @xcite .",
    "some relevant details of the statistical tests used are as follows .",
    "one of the approaches by kendall and collaborators @xcite involves the assumption that the standing stones lie within a compact convex polygon ( ` the cornish coastline ' for the particular land s end standing stones problem ) .",
    "detail of the compact convex polygon then enters the test s outcome .",
    "however , this restriction is made in order to to cope with uniform independent identically - distributed distributions ( much as quantum physicists often perform ` normalization by boxing ' ) . moreover , other approaches by kendall and collaborators use distributions that tail off ; in these cases , involvement of a ` coastline ' ceases to be necessary .",
    "the probability distributions in question then live on the shape space of the triangles that one is sampling with . as per sec 3 , this is ( a piece of ) @xmath51 for which geometry and subsequent mathematical methods are well - understood . in this manner , one is dealing with a _",
    "geometrical statistics_. a fortiori , it is a _ shape statistics _ in accord with the following distinction .",
    "geometrical statistics concerns applying probability and statistics techniques to sample spaces that are differentiable manifolds @xcite , involving suitable notions of @xmath52-field , geometrical measure , change of variables formulae and taking isometries into account .",
    "shape statistics , however , concerns a differentiable ( in general stratified ) manifold the points of which can , a furthermore , be interpreted as ` shapes in space ' .    finally , a suitable conceptual notion for assessing the approximate collinearity of triples of points is kendall s notion of @xmath53-bluntness ( see fig [ ecoll].a ) .",
    "kendall additionally generalized such methods from sampling in triples to sampling in @xmath54-tuples in 2-@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "* clumping  kendall paradigm for rpm records theory*. roach s clumping and kendall s alignment in threes cover the detection of _ discernible patterns _ in the ratios of relative separations and relative angle types of shape information in the @xmath22-a - gon configurations of rpm .",
    "furthermore , it is discernible patterns that distinguish certain subconfigurations of an instant as a pre - record .",
    "thus these statistical techniques constitute quantitative means of determining whether a given configuration is a meaningful pre - record rather than a purely random subconfiguration . between shape geometry furnishing the notion of distance needed for records postulate 1 ) and",
    "shape statistics furnishing the notions of useful information and correlation needed for records postulate 2 ) as a corollary of the ` direct = best - matched ' theorem , we have a working theory of classical pre - records .",
    "this pioneers the use of a wider variety of notions of pattern assessment so as to render _ any _ physical theory s records theory formulation quantitatively meaningful .",
    "see @xcite for outlines of examples of notions of shape , shape mechanics , shape statistics and records theories in a wider range of settings .",
    "let us comment in more detail on kendall s approach from an rpm perspective .",
    "that the method of sampling in threes is based on probing with the 2-@xmath12 model s minimal - sized nontrivially - relational subconfigurations : the constituent triangles .",
    "the subset of methods involving fitting within a convex polygon are not per se a restriction on rpm instant configurations , since one can always rescale these to fit within .",
    "however , detail of the convex shape in question entering the conclusion would now constitute an unwanted vestige of absolute structure .",
    "thus the other subset of methods involving probability distributions that tail off instead is particularly welcome in the rpm context , as a freeing from such a background - independent imprint .",
    "the pre - records found peak about the real projective space @xmath55 ` equator ' of collinearity that each @xmath22-a - gonland shape space @xmath25 possesses @xcite . since rpm s",
    "hitherto studied in detail have involved small particle numbers @xcite , i point out that the 3 points of a triangle are too few for this application to records theory .",
    "this is because sampling in threes means that a single triangle s worth of data plays the role of the statistically - meaningless sample size of 1 .",
    "nontriviality in this application thus starts with quadrilateral configurations @xcite , which allow for sampling with up to 4 constituent triangles .",
    "moreover , one needs a constellation containing somewhat more points than that in order to attain a _ statistically significant _ sample size .",
    "finally , as regards obtaining a semblance of history from records , now significant results for different values of @xmath53 carry different implications @xcite .",
    "were they laid out skillfully by the epoch s standards for e.g. astronomical or religious reasons ( @xmath56 minutes of arc ) , or were they just the markers of routes or plots of land ( @xmath57 degree ) ?",
    "barbour s relational particle mechanics ( rpm ) are of considerable interest both as theories of mechanics which implement leibnizian and machian features and as toy models of many aspects of gr - as - geometrodynamics .",
    "direct jacobi ",
    "synge construction of the mechanics corresponding to kendall s shape space geometry and to the cone thereover produces the same mechanics as reducing barbour s pure - shape and scaled rpm s respectively , which he formulated indirectly instead : using best matching .",
    "subsequent application of shape statistics to theoretical physics is new . in the present article ,",
    "i have shown that this is ready - built for use in the case of the 1- and 2-@xmath12 rpm s  the rpm s that are _ productive _ model arenas of gr - as - geometrodynamics .",
    "this can be used to quantify whether given subconfigurations are records , a matter of interest in timeless ( and histories  see below ) approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "i leave expressing the shape statistics quantifiers themselves in terms of these for a future occasion .    instead",
    ", i pose a difficult and interesting question .",
    "this follows from gr having its own analogue of shape space : cs(@xmath46 ) , and globally and locally scaled counterparts thereof : \\{cs",
    "+ v}(@xmath46 ) and superspace(@xmath46 ) respectively .",
    "the question then is what are the corresponding notions of ( scale and ) shape statistics , which one would use to quantitatively detect records within ( conformo)geometrodynamical subconfigurations ?",
    "some intermediate steps toward this are as follows ( see @xcite for details and references ) .",
    "minisuperspace ( homogeneous gr ) and inhomogeneous perturbations about homogeneous gr are rather simpler models than full gr .",
    "\\2 ) at the other extreme , full gr s shape space  cs(@xmath46 )  is both infinite-@xmath12 and a stratified manifold , though some of kendall s work @xcite makes it clear that geometrical statistics can indeed transcend to stratified manifold geometries .",
    "\\3 ) the inhomogeneous perturbation model is intermediate in complexity between the previous two cases , and can furthermore be seen as a replacement of the point particles of rpm s by small inhomogeneous lumps within a gr framework . by this , and by cs(@xmath46 ) being a shape space , the name ` shape statistics ' indeed continues to be merited for this example by the argument given in sec 9 .",
    "furthermore , this line of enquiry for 3 ) could lead to new methods and insights as regards the analysis of the detailed data recently gathered by the planck satellite .",
    "finally , of course , one s ultimate interest as regards quantum gravity and the records theory approach to this is , additionally , quantum - mechanical .",
    "barbour suggested @xcite the formation of tracks by @xmath58-particles in bubble chambers as a paradigm for timeless records formation from which a sense of dynamics or history could be extracted .",
    "however , it may well be far more typical for decoherence to leave most to all information in an irretrievable state , as suggested e.g. by the joos",
    " zeh paradigm of a dust particle decohering due to the microwave background photons @xcite .",
    "barbour also conjectured that quantum probability density function ` mist ' might peak in some geometrically distinguished region of configuration space , whose configurations happen to be meaningful records @xcite .",
    "unfortunately for this conjecture , the concrete examples of small classical and quantum rpm s that i have worked out so far do not support it @xcite .",
    "n.b . that records theory is useful not only in purely timeless approaches but also in approaches which assume a sense of history @xcite .",
