    "we consider a system of infinitely many brownian particles in @xmath7 , interacting via the gradient of a symmetric pair potential @xmath4 .",
    "since each particle can move through each position in space , the system is called continuous and is used for modeling suspensions , gases or fluids .",
    "the infinite volume , infinite particle , stochastic dynamics @xmath8 heuristically solves the following infinite system of stochastic differential equations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 ,  @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a _ sequence of independent brownian motions_. its informal generator is given by @xmath13 using @xmath14 we have @xmath15 note that @xmath16 in this form is not well - defined .",
    "the construction of such diffusions has been initiated by r.  lang @xcite , who considered the case @xmath17 using finite dimensional approximations and stochastic differential equations .",
    "more singular @xmath4 , which are of particular interest in physics , as e.g.  the lennard ",
    "jones potential , have been treated by h.  osada , @xcite , and m.  yoshida , @xcite .",
    "osada and yoshida were the first to use dirichlet forms for the construction of such processes .",
    "however , they could not write down the corresponding generators or martingale problems explicitly , hence could not prove that their processes actually solve ( [ sde ] ) weakly . this , however , was proved in @xcite by showing an integration by parts formula for the respective grand canonical gibbs measures .",
    "another approach not using an integration by parts can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors provide an @xmath18-limit for the infinite volume , infinite particle stochastic dynamics with singular interactions in continuous particle systems on @xmath19 .",
    "their construction is the first covering the case @xmath20 in the space of single configurations ( only one particle at one site for all times @xmath11 ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the tagged particle process in continuum with singular interactions .",
    "the underlying model can be described as follows .",
    "consider the infinite system of brownian particles described by ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "coloring any one particle from the system blue and all the rest of the particles yellow , we investigate the motion of this _ tagged particle _ in the random sea of all the yellow ones . in @xcite this model and a scaling limit of it is studied for brownian particles in @xmath21 interacting via the gradient of a smooth , finite range , symmetric , positive pair potential . in @xcite",
    "the author considers the tagged particle process for more singular potentials , including the lennard ",
    "jones potential , using dirichlet form techniques .",
    "however , there the author is also mainly interested in obtaining a scaling limit for the tagged particle process .",
    "showing existence of the stochastic dynamics in the above cited articles has been left open .",
    "osada gives reference to a forthcoming paper on his own , but as far as we know , it has never been published .",
    "thus in our opinion there is a need to construct the tagged particle process with interaction potential rigorously . for other strategies to obtain the tagged particle process see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) and the references therein . but note that these are not worked out in detail .",
    "we start with an heuristic approach just to clarify the way of posing the problem .",
    "after doing so the whole analysis will be done on a strictly rigorous level .",
    "assume we are given a solution @xmath22 , of ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "using the coordinate transformation @xmath23 we can rewrite ( [ sde ] ) and obtain @xmath24 to derive the informal generator of the process @xmath25 corresponding to ( [ tppro ] ) and ( [ envpro ] ) , we use again the coordinate transformation ( [ ctrans ] ) and obtain @xmath26 plugging this into the representation of @xmath16 in ( [ genivipdif ] ) yields @xmath27 by setting @xmath28 we obtain @xmath29 hence @xmath30 splits into @xmath31 where @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 is called _",
    "environment process_. it is the marginal of the @xmath35-process describing the environment seen from the tagged particle and having @xmath36 as informal generator .",
    "@xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the informal generator of a gradient stochastic dynamics with additional drift term ( compare ( [ densityivipdif ] ) and ( [ denscoup ] ) ) . in the sequel",
    "we call the dynamics corresponding to @xmath39 a _ gradient stochastic dynamics with additional drift_.    now ( [ tppro ] ) with @xmath40 describes the motion @xmath41 of the tagged particle which is determined by the environment process @xmath34 .",
    "thus @xmath30 is the informal generator of the diffusion process coupling the motion of the tagged particle in @xmath21 and the motion of the environment seen from this particle .",
    "the tagged particle process is then obtained by a projection of the coupled process generated informally by @xmath30 .    on a rigorous level the infinite volume , infinite particle , stochastic dynamics in continuous particle systems",
    "can be realized as an infinite dimensional diffusion process taking values in the configuration space @xmath42 and having a grand canonical gibbs measure as an invariant measure . in @xcite the generator realizing @xmath16 ( see ( [ genivipdif ] ) ) is given by @xmath43 it is obtained by carrying out an integration by parts of @xmath44 with respect to a grand canonical gibbs measure @xmath45 corresponding to an intensity measure @xmath46 .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the operator realizing @xmath39 ( see ( [ igenmgsd ] ) ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 , i.e.  a grand canonical gibbs measure corresponding to a pair potential @xmath4 and an intensity measure @xmath49 , with corresponding correlation measures fulfilling a ruelle bound .",
    "the associated symmetric bilinear form is given by @xmath50 having a ruelle bound enables us to prove an integration by parts formula for cylinder functions on the configuration space @xmath2 with respect to the underlying grand canonical gibbs measure @xmath3 for a general class of pair potentials @xmath4 .",
    "this is done in section [ secintbp1 ] , see theorem [ thmintbyparts ] . using this result",
    "we can identify @xmath51 as generator of @xmath52 on @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , showing that @xmath54 is a conservative , local , quasi - regular , symmetric dirichlet form we have the existence of a conservative diffusion process @xmath55 solving the associated martingale problem . to tackle @xmath52 we got many ideas from @xcite , but due to the more general intensity measure @xmath56 according to @xmath3 , we have to deal with additional technical problems .",
    "next step is to investigate the operator realizing @xmath36 ( see ( [ igenenv ] ) ) .",
    "hence we consider @xmath57 @xmath58 and the associated symmetric bilinear form @xmath59 here @xmath3 is again as above . for an activity @xmath60 and a general class of pair potentials @xmath4 in @xcite for a non - empty subset of @xmath61 an integration by parts formula with respect to @xmath6 is shown . in the sequel",
    "we denote this subset of @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "hence for @xmath63 the bilinear form @xmath64 is closable .",
    "furthermore , together with the results we obtained for @xmath54 we prove that @xmath65 is a conservative , local , quasi - regular , symmetric dirichlet form .",
    "thus we obtain a conservative diffusion process @xmath66 solving the associated martingale problem .",
    "hence @xmath66 solves ( [ envpro ] ) weakly and describes the motion of the environment seen from the tagged particle .    finally , as the operator realizing @xmath67 ( see ( [ igencoup ] ) ) we consider @xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath70 for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath60 .",
    "the associated symmetric bilinear form is given by @xmath74 applying a strategy as used for tackling @xmath52 and @xmath75 we have that also @xmath76 is a conservative , local , quasi - regular dirichlet form , where @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , there exists a conservative diffusion process @xmath78 taking values in @xmath79 for @xmath80 ( for @xmath20 the process exists only in the larger space @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the configuration space of multiple configurations ) solving the martingale problem associated to ( [ tppro ] ) and ( [ envpro ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath78 realizes the coupling of the motion of the tagged particle and the motion of the environment seen from the tagged particle .",
    "then we obtain the tagged particle process by a projection of the process @xmath78 to its first component .",
    "note that the resulting process in general is no longer a markov process .",
    "the progress achieved in this paper may be summarized by the following list of core results :    * we prove an integration by parts formula for @xmath1 with respect to grand canonical gibbs measures @xmath3 fulfilling a ruelle bound and having @xmath5 , as intensity measure , see theorems [ thmintbyparts ] .",
    "* we provide a rigorous explicit representation of the generator @xmath83 of the coupled process for functions in @xmath84 , see theorem [ thmexcoup ] . *",
    "we prove quasi - regularity for @xmath65 , the dirichlet form corresponding to the environment process , see lemma [ leme22 ] .",
    "* we show the existence of the tagged particle process with interaction potential rigorously by using dirichlet form techniques , see theorem [ thmexprocoup ] and remark [ remextppro ] . *",
    "the process we construct is conservative and the unique solution to the martingale problem corresponding to the friedrichs extension of @xmath85 , see theorem [ thmexprocoup ] . *",
    "our results give the first mathematically rigorous and complete construction of the tagged particle process in continuum with interaction potential .    here",
    "we would like to stress that all the above results hold for a very general class of interaction potentials .",
    "we only have to assume that the interaction potential is super stable ( ss ) , integrable ( i ) , lower regular ( lr ) , differentiable and @xmath86 ( d@xmath87 ) , @xmath88 , and locally summable ( ls ) .",
