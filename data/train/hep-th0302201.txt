    "we have known light and fermions for many years .",
    "but we still can not give a satisfactory answer to the following fundamental questions : what are light and fermions ?",
    "where light and fermions come from ? why light and fermions exist ? at moment , the standard answers to the above fundamental questions appear to be `` light is the particle described by a gauge field '' and `` fermions are the particles described by anti - commuting fields '' . here , we like to argue that there is another possible answer to the above questions : our vacuum is filled with string - like objects that form network of arbitrary sizes and those string - nets form a quantum condensed state . according to the string - net picture ,",
    "the light ( and other gauge bosons ) is a vibration of the condensed string - nets and fermions are ends of strings ( or nodes of string - nets ) .",
    "the string - net condensation provides a unified origin of light and fermions .    before discussing the above fundamental questions in more detail",
    ", we would like to clarify what do we mean by `` light exists '' and `` fermions exist '' . we know that there is a natural mass scale in physics  the planck mass .",
    "planck mass is so large that any observed particle have a mass at least factor @xmath0 smaller than the planck mass .",
    "so all the observed particles can be treated as massless when compared with planck mass .",
    "when we ask why some particles exist , we really ask why those particles are massless ( or nearly massless when compared with planck mass ) .",
    "so the real issue is to understand what makes certain excitations ( such as light and fermions ) massless .",
    "we have known that symmetry breaking is a way to get gapless bosonic excitations .",
    "we will see that string - net condensation is another way to get gapless excitations .",
    "however , string - net condensations can generate massless gauge bosons and massless fermions .",
    "second , we would like to clarify what do we mean by `` origin of light and fermions '' .",
    "we know that everything has to come from something .",
    "so when we ask `` where light and fermions come from '' , we have assumed that there are some things simpler and more fundamental than light and fermions . in the section [ lbm ] , we define local bosonic models which are simpler than models with gauge fields coupled to fermions .",
    "we will regard local bosonic models as more fundamental ( the locality principle ) .",
    "we will show that light and fermions can emerge from a local bosonic model if the model contains a condensation of nets of string - like object in its ground state .    after the above two clarifications , we can state more precisely the meaning of `` string - net condensation provides another possible answer to the fundamental questions about light and fermions '' .",
    "when we say gauge bosons and fermions originate from string - net condensation , we really mean that ( nearly ) _ massless _ gauge bosons and fermions originate from string - net condensation in a _ local bosonic model_.      before considering the origin of massless photon and massless fermions , let us consider a simpler massless ( or gapless ) excitation  phonon .",
    "we can ask three similar questions about phonon : what is phonon ? where phonon comes from ?",
    "why phonon exists ? we know that those are scientific questions and we know their answers .",
    "phonon is a vibration of a crystal .",
    "phonon comes from a spontaneous translation symmetry breaking .",
    "phonon exists because the translation - symmetry - breaking phase actually exists in nature .",
    "in particular , the gaplessness of phonon is directly originated from and protected by the spontaneous translation symmetry breaking.@xcite many other gapless excitations , such as spin wave , superfluid mode , also come from condensation of point - like objects that break certain symmetries .",
    "it is quite interesting to see that our understanding of a gapless excitation - phonon - is rooted in our understanding of phases of matter .",
    "according to landau s theory,@xcite phases of matter are different because they have different broken symmetries .",
    "the symmetry description of phases is very powerful .",
    "it allows us to classify all possible crystals .",
    "it also provides the origin for gapless phonons and many other gapless excitations .",
    "until a few years ago , it was believed that the condensations of point - like objects , and the related symmetry breaking and order parameters , can describe all the orders ( or phases ) in nature .",
    "knowing light as a massless excitation , one may wonder maybe light , just like phonon , is also a nambu - goldstone mode from a broken symmetry .",
    "however , experiments tell us that a @xmath1 gauge boson , such as light , is really different from a nambu - goldstone mode in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "therefore it is impossible to use landau s symmetry breaking theory and condensation of point - like objects to understand the origin and the masslessness of light . also",
    ", nambu - goldstone modes are always bosonic , thus it is impossible to use symmetry breaking to understand the origin and the ( nearly ) masslessness of fermions .",
    "it seems that there does not exist any order that can give rise to massless light and massless fermions .",
    "because of this , we put light and electron into a different category than phonon .",
    "we regarded them as elementary and introduced them by hand into our theory of nature .",
    "however , if we believe light and electrons , just like phonon , exist for a reason , then such a reason must be a certain order in our vacuum that protect the masslessness of light and electron .",
    "( here we have assumed that light and electron are not something that we place in an empty vacuum .",
    "our vacuum is more like an `` ocean '' which is not empty .",
    "light and electron are collective excitations that correspond to certain patterns of `` water '' motion . )",
    "now the question is that what kind of order can give rise to light and electron , and protect their masslessness .",
    "if we really believe in the equality between light , electron and phonon , then the very existence of light and fermions indicates that our understanding of states of matter is incomplete",
    ". we should deepen and expand our understanding of the states of matter .",
    "there should be new states of matter that contain new kind of orders .",
    "the new orders will produce light and electron , and protect their masslessness .",
    "after the discovery of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect,@xcite it became clear that the landau s symmetry breaking theory can not describe different fqh states , since those states all have the _ same _ symmetry .",
    "it was proposed that fqh states contain a new kind of order - topological order.@xcite topological order is new because it can not be described by symmetry breaking , long range correlation , and local order parameters .",
    "non of the usual tools that we used to characterize phases applies to topological order . despite of this ,",
    "topological order is not an empty concept .",
    "topological order can be characterized by a new set of tools , such as the number of degenerate ground states , quasiparticle statistics , and edge states .",
    "it was shown that the ground state degeneracy of a topological ordered state is a universal property since the degeneracy is robust against any perturbations.@xcite such a topological degeneracy demonstrates the existence of topological order .",
    "it can also be used to perform fault tolerant quantum computations.@xcite        recently , the concept of topological order was generalized to quantum order.@xcite quantum order is used to describe new kinds of orders in gapless quantum states .",
    "one way to understand quantum order is to see how it fits into a general classification scheme of orders ( see fig .",
    "[ clorder ] ) .",
    "first , different orders can be divided into two classes : symmetry breaking orders and non - symmetry breaking orders .",
    "the symmetry breaking orders can be described by a local order parameter and can be said to contain a condensation of point - like objects .",
    "all the symmetry breaking orders can be understood in terms of landau s symmetry breaking theory .",
    "the non - symmetry breaking orders can not be described by symmetry breaking , neither by the related local order parameters and long range correlations .",
    "thus they are a new kind of orders .",
    "if a quantum system ( a state at zero temperature ) contains a non - symmetry breaking order , then the system is said to contain a non - trivial quantum order .",
    "we see that a quantum order is simply a non - symmetry breaking order in a quantum system .",
    "quantum order can be further divided into many subclasses .",
    "if a quantum state is gapped , then the corresponding quantum order will be called topological order .",
    "the low energy effective theory of a topological ordered state will be a topological field theory.@xcite the second class of quantum orders appear in fermi liquids ( or free fermion systems ) .",
    "the different quantum orders in fermi liquids are classified by the fermi surface topology.@xcite      in this paper , we will concentrate on the third class of quantum orders  the quantum orders from condensation of nets of strings , or simply , string - net condensation.@xcite this class of quantum orders shares some similarities with the symmetry breaking orders of `` particle '' condensation . we know that different symmetry breaking orders can be classified by symmetry groups . using group theory",
    ", we can classify all the 230 crystal orders in three dimensions .",
    "the symmetry also produces and protects gapless nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "similarly , as we will see later in this paper , different string - net condensations ( and the corresponding quantum orders ) can be classified by a mathematical object called projective symmetry group ( psg).@xcite using psg , we can classify over 100 different 2d spin liquids that all have the same symmetry.@xcite just like symmetry group , psg can also produce and protect gapless excitations .",
    "however , unlike symmetry group , psg produces and protects gapless gauge bosons and gapless fermions.@xcite because of this , we can say light and massless fermions can have a unified origin .",
    "they can come from string - net condensations .",
    "we used to believe that to have light and fermions in our theory , we have to introduce by hand a fundamental @xmath1 gauge field and anti - commuting fermion fields , since at that time we did not know any collective modes that behave like gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "now , we know that gauge bosons and fermions appear commonly and naturally in quantum ordered states , as fluctuations of condensed string - nets and ends of open strings .",
    "this raises an issue : do light and fermions come from a fundamental @xmath1 gauge field and anti - commuting fields as in the 123 standard model or do they come from a particular quantum order in our vacuum ? clearly it is more natural to assume light and fermions come from a quantum order in our vacuum . from the connection between string - net condensation , quantum order , and massless",
    "gauge / fermion excitations , it is very tempting to propose the following answers to the fundamental questions about light and ( nearly ) massless fermions :    had our vacuum chosen to have a `` particle '' condensation , there would be only nambu - goldstone bosons at low energies . such a universe would be very boring .",
    "string - net condensation and the resulting light and ( nearly ) massless fermions provide a much more interesting universe , at least interesting enough to support intelligent life to study the origin of light and massless fermions .",
    "the string - net picture of fermions explains why there is always an even number of fermions in our universe .",
    "the string - net picture for gauge bosons and fermions also has an experimental prediction : all fermions must carry certain gauge charges.@xcite at first sight , this prediction appears to contradict with the known experimental fact that neutron carry no gauge charges .",
    "thus one may think the string - net picture of gauge bosons and fermions has already been falsified by experiments . here",
    "we would like to point out that the string - net picture of gauge bosons and fermions can still be correct if we assume the existence of a new discrete gauge field , such as a @xmath2 gauge field , in our universe . in this case ,",
    "neutrons and neutrinos carry a non - zero charge of the discrete gauge field .",
    "therefore , the string - net picture of gauge bosons and fermions predict the existence of discrete gauge excitations ( such as gauge flux lines ) in our universe .",
    "we would like to remark that , despite the similarity , the above string - net picture of gauge bosons and fermions is different from the picture of standard superstring theory . in standard superstring theory , closed strings correspond to gravitons , and open string correspond to gauge bosons .",
    "all the elementary particles correspond to different vibration modes of small strings in the superstring theory .",
    "also , the fermions in the standard superstring theory come from the fermion fields on the world sheet . in our string - net picture ,",
    "the vacuum is filled with large nets of strings .",
    "the massless gauge bosons correspond to the fluctuations of large closed string - nets ( nets of closed strings ) and fermions correspond to the ends of open strings in string nets .",
    "anti - commuting fields are not needed to produce ( nearly ) massless fermions .",
    "massless fermions appear as low energy collective modes in a purely bosonic system .",
    "the string - net picture for gauge theories have a long history .",
    "the closed - string description of gauge fluctuations is intimately related to the wilson loop in gauge theory.@xcite the relation between dynamical gauge theory and a dynamical wilson - loop theory was suggested in . studied the hamiltonian of a non - local model - lattice gauge theory .",
    "it was found that the lattice gauge theory contains a string - net structure and the gauge charges can be viewed as ends of strings . in various duality relations between lattice gauge theories and theories of extended objects",
    "were reviewed .",
    "in particular , some statistical lattice gauge models were found to be dual to certain statistical membrane models.@xcite this duality relation is directly connected to the relation between gauge theory and closed - string - net theory@xcite in quantum models .",
    "emerging fermions from local bosonic models also have a complicated history . the first examples of emerging fermions / anyons were the fractional quantum hall states,@xcite where fermionic / anyonic excitations were obtained theoretically from interacting bosons in magnetic field.@xcite in 1987",
    ", fermion fields and gauge fields were introduced to express the spin-1/2 hamiltonian in the slave - boson approach.@xcite however , writing a bosonic hamiltonian in terms of fermion fields does not imply the appearance of well defined fermionic quasiparticles . emerging fermionic excitations can appear only in deconfined phases of the gauge field .",
    "constructed several deconfined phases where the fermion fields do describe well defined quasiparticles . however , depending on the property of deconfined phases , those quasiparticles may carry fractional statistics ( for the chiral spin states)@xcite or fermi statistics ( for the @xmath2 deconfined states).@xcite    also in 1987 , in a study of resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) states , emerging fermions ( the spinons ) were proposed in a nearest neighbor dimer model on square lattice.@xcite but , according to the deconfinement picture , the results in are valid only when the ground state of the dimer model is in the @xmath2 deconfined phase .",
    "it appears that the dimer liquid on square lattice with only nearest neighbor dimers is not a deconfined state,@xcite and thus it is not clear if the nearest neighbor dimer model on square lattice@xcite has the fermionic quasiparticles or not.@xcite however , on triangular lattice , the dimer liquid is indeed a @xmath2 deconfined state.@xcite therefore , the results in are valid for the triangular - lattice dimer model and fermionic quasiparticles do emerge in a dimer liquid on triangular lattice .",
    "all the above models with emerging fermions are 2 + 1d models , where the emerging fermions can be understood from binding flux to a charged particle.@xcite recently , it was pointed out in that the key to emerging fermions is a string structure .",
    "fermions can generally appear as ends of open strings .",
    "the string picture allows a construction of a 3 + 1d local bosonic model that has emerging fermions .    comparing with those previous results ,",
    "the new features discussed in this paper are : ( a ) _ massless _ gauge bosons and fermions can emerge from _ local bosonic models _ as a result of string - net condensation .",
    "( b ) massless fermions are protected by the string - net condensation ( and the associated psg ) .",
    "( c ) string - net condensed states represent a new kind of phases which can not be described landau s symmetry breaking theory .",
    "different string - net condensed states are characterized by different psg s .",
    "( d ) qed and qcd can emerge from a local bosonic model on cubic lattice .",
    "the effective qed and qcd has @xmath3 families of leptons and quarks .",
    "each family has one lepton and two flavors of quarks .",
    "the bottom line is that , within local bosonic models , massless fermions do not just emerge by themselves .",
    "emerging massless fermions , emerging massless gauge bosons , string - net condensations , and psg are intimately related .",
    "they are just different sides of same coin - quantum order .    according to the picture of quantum order , elementary particles ( such as photon and electron )",
    "may not be elementary after all .",
    "they may be collective excitations of a local bosonic system below planck scale .",
    "since we can not do experiments close to planck scale , it is hard to determine if photon and electron are elementary particles or not . in this paper",
    ", we would like to show that the string - net picture of light and fermions is at least self consistent by studying some concrete local boson models which produce massless gauge bosons and massless fermions through string - net condensations .",
    "the local boson models studied here are just a few examples among a long list of local boson models that contain emerging fermions and gauge fields .    here",
    "we would like to stress that the string - net picture for the actual gauge bosons and fermions in our universe is only a proposal at moment .",
    "although string - net condensation can produce and protect massless photons , gluons , quarks , and other charged leptons , we do not know at moment if string - net condensations can produce neutrinos which are chiral fermions , and the weak - interaction @xmath4 gauge field which couples chirally to the quarks and the leptons . also , we do not know if string - net condensation can produce an odd number of families of quarks and leptons .",
    "the qed and qcd produced by the known string - net condensations all contain an even number of families so far .",
    "the correctness of string - net condensation in our vacuum depend on resolving the above problems .",
    "nature has four fascinating and somewhat strange properties : gauge bosons , fermi statistics , chiral fermions , and gravity .",
    "the string - net condensation picture provides a natural explanation for the first two properties .",
    "two more to go .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we concern about a condensed matter problem : how to use bosons to make artificial light and artificial fermions , then the string - net picture and quantum order do provide an answer . to make artificial light and artificial fermions",
    ", we simply let certain string - nets to condense .    in some recent work , quantum orders and their connection to emerging gauge bosons and fermions were studied using psg s , without realizing their connection to string - net condensation.@xcite in this paper , we will show that the quantum ordered states described by psg s are actually string - net condensed states .",
    "the gauge bosons and fermions produced and protected by the psg s have a very natural string - net interpretation.@xcite quantum order , psg , and string - net condensation are different parts of the same story . here",
    "we will summarize and expand those previous work and try to present a coherent picture for quantum order , psg , and string - net condensation , as well as the associated emerging gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "section [ sec : z2 ] reviews the work in",
    ". we will study an exactly soluble spin-1/2 model on square lattice@xcite .",
    "the model was solved using slave - boson approach.@xcite this allowed us to identify the psg that characterizes the non - trivial quantum order in the ground state.@xcite here , following , we will solve the model from string - net condensation point of view .",
    "since the ground state of the model can be described by both string - net condensation and psg , this allows us to demonstrate the direct connection between string - net condensation and psg in section [ psgstring ] .",
    "the model is also one of the simplest models that demonstrates the connection between string - net condensation and emerging gauge field and fermions.@xcite    however , the above exact soluble model does not contain gapless gauge boson and gapless fermions . if we regard the lattice scale as the planck scale , then gauge bosons and fermions do not `` exist '' in our model in the sense discussed in section [ fq ] . in section [ masslessferm ] , we will discuss an exact soluble local bosonic model that contain massless dirac fermions . in sections [ qed ] and [ secqcd ]",

    "gauge bosons and fermions `` exist '' in those latter models .",
    "in this paper , we will only consider local bosonic models .",
    "local bosonic models are important since they are really local .",
    "we note that a fermionic model are in general non local since the fermion operators at different sites do not commute , even when the sites are well separated . due to their intrinsic locality ,",
    "local bosonic models are natural candidates for the fundamental theory of nature . in the following",
    "we will give a detailed definition of local bosonic models .    to define a physical system , we need to specify ( a ) a total hilbert space , ( b ) a definition of a set of local physical operators , and ( c ) a hamiltonian . with this understanding",
    ", a local bosonic model is defined to be a model that satisfies : ( a ) the total hilbert space is a direct product of local hilbert spaces of finite dimensions .",
    "( b ) local physical operators are local bosonic operators . by definition , _ local bosonic operators _ are operators acting within a local hilbert space or finite products of those operators for nearby local hilbert spaces . those operators are called local bosonic operators since they all commute with each other when far apart .",
    "( c ) the hamiltonian is a sum of local physical operators .",
    "a spin-1/2 system on a lattice is an example of local bosonic models .",

    "local physical operators are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the pauli matrices .",
    "a free spinless fermion system ( in 2 or higher dimensions ) is not a local bosonic model despite it has the same total hilbert space as the spin-1/2 system .",
    "this is because the fermion operators @xmath11 on different sites do not commute and are not local bosonic operators .",
    "more importantly , the fermion hoping hamiltonian in 2 and higher dimensions can not be written as a sum of local bosonic operators .",
    "( note in higher dimensions , we can not write all the hoping terms @xmath12 as product of local bosonic operators .",
    "however , due to the jordan - wigner transformation , a 1d fermion hoping @xmath13 can be written as a local bosonic operators .",
    "hence , a 1d fermion system can be a local bosonic model if we exclude @xmath11 from our definition of local physical operators . )",
    "the bosonic field theory without cut - off is not a local bosonic model .",
    "this is because the local hilbert space does not have a finite dimension .",
    "a lattice gauge theory is not a local bosonic model .",
    "this is because its total hilbert space can not be a direct product of local hilbert spaces .",
    "another counter example of local bosonic model is a quantum closed - string - net model . a quantum closed - string - net model on lattice",
    "can be defined in the following way .",
    "let us consider only strings that cover nearest neighbor links",
    ". a closed - string configuration may have many closed strings with or without overlap .",
    "we will call a closed - string configuration a closed string - net . for every closed string - net , we assign a quantum state .",
    "all those quantum states form a basis of the total hilbert space of the closed - string - net model . just like lattice gauge theory , the closed - string - net model is not a local bosonic model since the total hilbert space can not be a direct product of local hilbert spaces .",
    "it turns out that closed - string - net models and lattice gauge model are closely related .",
    "in fact some closed - string - net models ( or statistical membrane models ) are equivalent to lattice gauge models.@xcite",

    "however , unlike symmetry breaking states which can only produce and protect gapless scaler bosons ( or nambu - goldstone modes ) , string - net condensed states can produce and protect gapless gauge bosons and gapless fermions .",
    "it is amazing to see that gapless fermions can even appear in local bosonic models .    motivated by the above results , we propose the following locality principle : _ the fundamental theory for our universe is a local bosonic model . _ using several local bosonic models as examples",
    ", we try to argue that the locality principle is not obviously wrong , if we assume that there is a string - net condensation in our vacuum .",
    "the string - net condensation can naturally produce and protect massless photons ( as well as gluons ) and ( nearly ) massless electrons / quarks .",
    "however , to really prove the string - net condensation in our vacuum , we need to show that string - net condensation can generate chiral fermions . also , the above locality principle has not taken quantum gravity into account .",
    "it may need to be generalized to include quantum gravity . in any case",
    ", we can say that we have a plausible understanding where light and fermions come from .",
    "the existence of light and fermions is no longer mysterious once we realize that they can come from local bosonic models via string - net condensations .",
    "the string - net condensation and the associated psg also provide a new solution to the chiral symmetry and the fermion mass problem in lattice qed and lattice qcd .",
    "we show that the symmetry of a lattice bosonic model leads to psg of the hopping hamiltonian for the ends of condensed strings .",
    "if the ends of condensed strings are fermions , then psg can some times protect the masslessness of the fermions , even though the chiral symmetry in the continuum limit can not be generalized to the lattice .",
    "thus psg can lead to an emerging chiral symmetry that protect massless dirac fermions .    in this paper , we have been stressing that string - net condensation and the associated psg can protect the masslessness of fermions . however , most fermions in nature do have masses , although very small comparing to the planck mass .",
    "one may wonder where those small masses come from . here",
    "we would like to point out that the psg argument for masslessness only works for radiative corrections .",
    "in other words , the fermions protected by string - net condensation and psg can not gain any mass from additive radiative corrections caused by high energy fluctuations .",
    "however , if the model has infrared divergence , then infrared divergence can give the would - be - massless fermions some masses .",
    "the acquired masses should have the scale of the infrared divergence .",
    "the 3 + 1d qed model studied in this paper do not have any infrared divergence .",
    "thus , the artificial electrons in the model are exactly massless .",
    "but in the bosonic model discussed in section [ secqcd ] , the @xmath586 gauge coupling @xmath632 runs as @xmath634 where @xmath635 is the cut - off scale .",
    "thus when @xmath636 , @xmath632 has a logarithmic infrared divergence . in general , for models with @xmath1 and @xmath586 gauge interactions and a right content of fermions , the @xmath586 gauge interactions can have a weak logarithmic infrared divergence in 3 + 1d.@xcite this weak divergence could generate mass of order @xmath637 , where @xmath638 is the planck mass or the gut scale ( the cut - off scale of the lattice theory ) , @xmath639 and @xmath640 is the dimensionless gauge coupling constant at the planck scale .",
    "an @xmath641 can produce a desired separation between the planck mass / gut scale and the masses of observed fermions .",
    "it is interesting to see that , in order to use string - net condensation picture to explain the origin of gauge bosons and nearly massless fermions , it is important to have a four dimensional space - time .",
    "when space - time has five or more dimensions , the gauge - fermion interaction do not have any infrared divergence . in this case , if a string - net condensation produces massless fermions , those fermions will remain to be massless down to zero energy . in 2 + 1d ,",
    "the gauge interaction between massless fermions is so strong that one can not have fermionic quasiparticles at low energies.@xcite it is amazing to see that 3 + 1 is the only space - time dimension that the gauge bosons and fermions produced by string - net condensation have weak enough interaction so that they can be identified at low energies and , at same time , have strong enough interaction to have a rich non - trivial structure at low energies ."
