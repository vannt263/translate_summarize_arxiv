    "<S> local perturbations of crystal and magnetic structure of @xmath0-iron near carbon interstitial impurity is investigated by _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the carbon impurity creates locally a region of ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering with substantial tetragonal distortions . </S>",
    "<S> exchange integrals and solution enthalpy are calculated , the latter being in a very good agreement with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> effect of the local distortions on the carbon - carbon interactions in @xmath0-iron is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> steel is a material playing unique role in our civilization . </S>",
    "<S> its main chemical composition is very simple , this is just iron and carbon . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , surprisingly , basic microscopic physics determining phase and structural states of the steel is rather poorly understood yet . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , mechanisms of development of lattice instability and martensitic transformation at cooling down of @xmath0-fe are still unknown . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted now that magnetism is of crucial importance for the phase stability of iron and its alloys  @xcite , however , more or less detailed theoretical studies have been carried out only for a particular case of invar fe - ni alloys  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> commonly used steel is based on the low - temperature ( @xmath1 ) bcc phase of iron . </S>",
    "<S> however , morphology of its microstructure which is decisive for all practical applications is formed during the quenching process from high - temperature fcc ( @xmath0 ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> kinetics of the @xmath2 transition is very sensitive to carbon concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the state of carbon in @xmath1-iron was a subject of numerous investigations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the state of carbon in @xmath0-iron is much less understood , and even its solution enthalpy calculated by state - of - art _ ab initio _ approach strongly disagrees with the experimental data  @xcite which is quite unusual .    the most probably , magnetic state of @xmath0-iron is relevant for structural properties of its alloys . </S>",
    "<S> its magnetic state is strongly frustrated which leads to existence of numerous complicated magnetic structures with very close energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> role of the lability of magnetic structure and the frustrations is discussed already in the context of invar problem  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of _ ab initio _ calculations of the electronic structure , lattice and magnetic properties of carbon solid solution in @xmath0-iron . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the carbon interstitial in octahedron void results in an essential local magnetic polarization and strong lattice distortions which should be taken into account , in particular , to obtain correct value of the solution enthalpy .    </S>",
    "<S> we used the siesta package of first - principles electronic structure calculations  @xcite with the generalized gradient approximation for the density functional  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> earlier the same approach has been successfully used to calculate various properties of bulk and surface iron  @xcite as well as fe clusters  @xcite . to calculate exchange interactions of the effective heisenberg model @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath4 are the classical spins defined by the direction and magnitude of obtained magnetic moments ) a standard density functional approach has been used based on the `` magnetic force theorem ''  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we optimized first the structure and then use the implementation of the green s function  @xcite into the lmto method  @xcite to calculate the effective exchange parameters which is not possible in the framework of siesta . </S>",
    "<S> justification of this approach will be presented below , at the discussion of the table [ tab2 ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> + lattice parameters , magnetic moments , and energies of different magnetic configurations per atom for @xmath0-fe with atomic relaxation taken into account ; numbers in parenthesis are taken from ref .. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mechanism of fm state stabilization by the carbon impurity can be understood by investigation of fe - c chemical bonding . </S>",
    "<S> we present the density of states ( dos ) for fe in fe@xmath5c supercell , together with the local dos for carbon impurity , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that for a broad energy interval ( @xmath6ev ) near the fermi level the hybridization of the @xmath7-states of carbon with the @xmath8-states of iron is much more pronounced for the fm state ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) than for both afm ones ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to the energy stabilization of fm states in fcc fe - c alloys , which results in positive exchange interactions even without structure relaxation ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of anisotropic structural relaxation increases formation of strong fm bonds ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c ) and reduce the total iron dos at the fermi level ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) in comparison with the original afm states .    </S>",
    "<S> the solution enthalpy of carbon in @xmath0-iron has been calculated from the total energies of fm fe@xmath5c and of afmd fcc fe ( which have the lowest energies among trial magnetic configurations ) , together with the ground state energy of graphite . </S>",
    "<S> the result is 0.55 ev whereas experimental value is about 0.4 ev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> keeping in mind that _ ab initio _ calculations without taking into account local distortions and correct magnetic ground state give just a wrong sign for this quantity  @xcite one can say that the agreement is rather good . </S>",
    "<S> actually , this is even better since our calculations have been done for high enough carbon concentration and thus a fictitious carbon - carbon interaction presents . </S>",
    "<S> estimations of this effect according to the standard elasticity theory  @xcite gives a value of order of 0.1 ev which should be subtracted from our result .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) total dos of iron atoms ( solid red line ) , dos of iron atoms from the first shell ( dotted blue line ) , and for carbon atom ( dashed green line ) for relaxed fe@xmath5c supercell with carbon in octahedral void for different magnetic configurations . </S>",
    "<S> , width=3 ]    we have done also calculations for the supercell fe@xmath9c with the afmd magnetic configuration . starting from third coordination sphere of the carbon atom the tetragonal deformation @xmath10 is approximately 7% which is close to the value for pure iron ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding values of local tetragonal distortions for the first shell near the carbon impurity is 3% and for second shell is already 6% . </S>",
    "<S> this means that respective to the tetragonal deformation of the host carbon produces local distortion of its nearest surrounding at approximately -4% which is a bit smaller than for fe@xmath5c supercell . </S>",
    "<S> the values of magnetic moments ( in @xmath11 units ) for the first three coordination spheres are 1.9 , 2.5 , and 2.6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , local tetragonal distortion around carbon atom can be considered , indeed , as an effect of single impurity .    </S>",
    "<S> interactions between carbon atoms via lattice distortions ( deformation interactions ) determine decomposition and carbon ordering processes in steel which are important for microstructure formation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> octahedral voids in bcc lattice are asymmetric themselves which results in local tetragonal distortions around carbon interstitial impurity and rather strong deformation interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly accepted that the deformation interactions in fcc host are much weaker since the voids are symmetric and the interstitial carbons are considered as purely dilatations centers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that proper including the magnetic effects leads to the local tetragonal distortions around carbon in @xmath0-fe of the same order of magnitude as in @xmath1-fe and , thus , traditional views on the importance of the deformation interactions in different phases should be reconsidered .    </S>",
    "<S> these local deformations are intimately connected with the effect of carbon on local magnetic configurations of iron . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that carbon changes signs of some exchange integrals from afm to fm . </S>",
    "<S> similar effects of strong distortion dependence of exchange interactions has been discussed earlier for fcc fe - ni alloys  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that in addition to above mentioned distance dependence of effective exchange interaction the effect of fe - c chemical bonding is also important </S>",
    "<S> .    it should be noted , that our calculations are done for the ground - state case whereas an interesting temperature interval for fe - c steels is above 10@xmath12 k. nevertheless , the investigated magnetic effects can be very important for understanding of structural distortions in @xmath0-iron alloy . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> local magnetic configurations and thus local distortions can survive till relatively high temperatures . for the classical heisenberg model on fcc lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field estimation for the curie temperature is equal to the energy difference between fm and afm configurations which gives a value of order of 500 k ( see table [ tab2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantum effects for magnetic moments of order of 2 @xmath11 increases this estimation by a factor of 2  @xcite which allows to assume that , at least , up to 10@xmath12 k local magnetic correlations will survive . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature can be higher for higher concentration of carbon . </S>",
    "<S> there are some direct experimental evidences that magnetic effects are important for the austenite - to - ferrite ( @xmath13 ) transformation in steel  @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the complex magnetic state with strong tetragonal distortions is predicted for @xmath0-iron near carbon impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated exchange interactions show the strong tendency to formation of local fm clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this effect changes drastically carbon - carbon deformation interactions in @xmath0-phase and thus should be relevant for the martensitic transformations in steel . </S>"
