    "evolving random graphs have recently attracted attention , see e.g. refs @xcite and references therein .",
    "this interest is mainly motivated by concrete problems related to the structure of communication or biological networks .",
    "experimental data are now available in many contexts @xcite .    in these examples ,",
    "the asymmetry and the evolving nature of the networks are likely to be important ingredients for deciphering their statistical properties .",
    "it is however far from obvious to find solvable cases that would possibly account for some relevant features of , say , the regulating network of a genome .",
    "although biology has strongly influenced our interest in evolving networks , the model we solve is not based on realistic biological facts but it nevertheless incorporates asymmetry and chronological order .",
    "understanding such simple evolving graphs may help understanding biological networks , at least by comparison and opposition .",
    "we were initially motivated by the study of the yeast genetic regulatory network presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors studied in and out degree distributions and discovered a strong asymmetry : a single gene may participate to the regulation of many other genes  the law for out - degrees seems to be large  , but each genes is only regulated by a few other genes  the law for in - degrees seems to have finite moments .",
    "this is why we consider oriented evolving random graphs in the sequel .",
    "a biological interpretation for the asymmetry is that the few promoter - repressor sites for each gene bind only to specific proteins , but that along the genome many promoter - repressor sites are homologous .",
    "however , this does not predict the precise laws .",
    "an understanding of the same features from a purely probabilistic viewpoint would be desirable as well .",
    "the recent experimental studies dealt with global statistical properties of evolving graphs , i.e. when the evolving network is observed at some fixed time with the ages of different vertices and edges not taken into account .",
    "there are simple experimental reasons for that  : to keep track of the ages would in many cases dramatically reduce the statistics , and in other cases this information is even not available .",
    "our second motivation is a better understanding of the local - in - time statistical properties of evolving networks .",
    "this helps dating or assigning likely ages to different structures of the networks .",
    "as we shall later see , the global analysis , which is like a time average , gives a distorted view of the real structure of the networks .",
    "we shall present a detailed analysis of local - in - time features in our model .",
    "the model we study is the natural evolving cousin of the famous erds - renyi random graphs @xcite .",
    "starting from a single vertex at time @xmath0 , a new vertex is created at each time step  so that at time @xmath1 , the size of the system , i.e. the number of vertices , is @xmath1  , and new oriented edges are created with specified probabilistic rules .",
    "a tunable parameter @xmath2 ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 describes asymptotically the average number of incoming edges on a vertex .",
    "precise definitions are given in the next section .",
    "our main results are the following  :    from very simple rules , we see an asymmetry emerging .",
    "the global in and out degree distributions are different .",
    "we also compute the local profiles of in and out degree distributions , and comment on the differences .",
    "we make a detailed global analysis for the structure and sizes of the connected components .",
    "we use generating function methods to write down a differential equation that implies recursion relations for the distribution of component sizes , see eqs.([cdiff],[crecur ] ) .",
    "a salient global feature of the model is a percolation phase transition at a critical value of the average connectivity . below this value",
    ", no single component contains a finite fraction of the sites in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "however , a slightly unusual situation occurs in that below the transition the system contains components whose sizes scale like a power of the total size of the graph , see eq.([eq : grosclu ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the probability distribution for component sizes has an algebraic queue , see eq.([asympk ] ) , and its number of finite moments jumps at specific values of the average connectivity . above the transition , this probability distribution becomes defective , but its decrease is exponential , see eq.([pklarge ] ) .",
    "the transition is continuous .",
    "close to the threshold , the fraction of sites in the giant component  the percolation cluster  has an essential singularity , see eq.([eq : pof ] ) .",
    "we argue that this result is universal , with the meaning used in the study of critical phenomena .",
    "the essential singularity at the percolation threshold had already been observed numerically by @xcite in a different model which we show to be in the same universality class as ours for the percolation transition , and computed analytically for another class of models in @xcite .",
    "we then turn to the study of local - in - time profiles of connected components .",
    "guided by a direct enumeration based on tree combinatorics , we show that they satisfy recursion relations , and we give the first few profiles ( isolated vertices , pairs , triples ) explicitly .",
    "the profile of the giant component is given by a differential equation , from which we extract the singularity in the far past and the critical singularity in the present ",
    "see eqs([eq : rho_0],[eq : rho_1 ] ) .",
    "in particular the giant component invades all the time slices of the graph above the transition .",
    "one strange feature of profiles , which would deserve a good explanation , is that in several instances the formal parameter involved in generating functions for global quantities is simply traded for the relative age to obtain interesting local - in - time observables , see eqs.([eq : young],[ddiff ] ) .",
    "we have compared our analytical results with numerical simulation whenever possible .    while polishing this paper , we became aware of @xcite , whose goals overlap partly with ours . when they can be compared , the results agree",
    "we construct evolving random graphs with the following rules : + ( i ) we consider a triangular array of independent random variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where @xmath5 takes value @xmath0 with probability @xmath7 $ ] and value @xmath3 with probability @xmath8 .",
    "+ ( ii ) we start from the graph made of single vertex at initial time @xmath9 . at time @xmath1 , @xmath10 , a vertex with label @xmath1 is added together with the _ directed _ edges @xmath11 $ ] for which @xmath12 .",
    "we shall often take the viewpoint that the ( biased ) coin tossings defining @xmath13 are done at time @xmath1 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath14 at large time @xmath1 , with @xmath2 a parameter which we shall identify as half the average connectivity .",
    "this choice ensures the convergence of various distributions to stationary measures , most of them being independent of the precise values of the early probabilities .    by construction",
    "all edges arriving at a given vertex are simultaneously created at the instant of creation of this vertex . as a consequence ,",
    "these graphs are not only oriented but chronologically oriented  this is unrealistic from the biological viewpoint .",
    "in this section we give the incoming and outgoing edge distributions .",
    "+ let @xmath15 be the number of incoming edges at the vertex @xmath16 , and @xmath17 be the number of outgoing edges at this vertex at time @xmath1 .",
    "+ let @xmath18 be the number of vertices with @xmath19 incoming edges , and @xmath20 be the number of vertices with @xmath19 outgoing edges at time @xmath1 .",
    "we may look either at the edge distributions at a given vertex , or we may look at the edge distributions defined by gathering averaged histograms over whole graphs .",
    "the former are specified by their generating functions , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes expectation value .",
    "it may depend on the specified vertex labeled by @xmath16 .",
    "the latter is defined by the generating functions , @xmath23 we remark that this global histogram distribution is the average of the local - in - time quantity @xmath24 . since at time @xmath1 the total number of vertices is @xmath1 , @xmath25 is properly normalized , @xmath26 , to define an averaged probability distribution function , independent of the vertices , for the incoming or outgoing edge variables @xmath27 : @xmath28    _ incoming vertices . _",
    "the number of incoming edges @xmath29 at vertex @xmath30 asymptotically possesses a poisson distribution since @xmath31\\simeq_{j\\to\\infty}\\exp({\\alpha}(z-1))\\ ] ] the convergence of this distribution justifies our choice of asymptotic probabilities @xmath32 .",
    "only the vertices whose ages @xmath16 scale with the age of the graph , i.e. with @xmath33 fixed , @xmath34 , give non trivial contributions at large time to the averaged histogram ( [ histo ] ) and @xmath35 this expression may also be retrieved by looking at the evolution equation of @xmath36 . indeed , consider adding the new vertex at time @xmath1 . since the edges are oriented from older to younger vertices , .",
    "] we have @xmath37 from the second definition in eq.([histo ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath38 as @xmath39 at large time , the stationary limit is given by eq.([v- ] ) .",
    "this yields a poissonian distribution with probabilities @xmath40    _ outgoing vertices .",

    "approximating at large time the sum over @xmath16 in eq.([histo ] ) by an integral over @xmath44 gives the histogram distribution : @xmath45 as for incoming vertices , this formula follows from the evolution equation for @xmath46 . indeed , since the numbers of outgoing edges",
    "@xmath47 from vertex @xmath16 at time @xmath1 and @xmath48 differ by @xmath49 we have @xmath50 . from definition ( [ histo ] ) this gives @xmath51 where the first term is the contribution of the newly added vertex at time @xmath1 .",
    "the stationary limit is given by eq.([v+ ] ) .",
    "this is a geometric distribution , slightly larger than the poisson distribution , with probabilities @xmath52    _ mixed distribution_. let @xmath53 be the number of vertices with @xmath54 outgoing and @xmath55 incoming edges at time @xmath1 . as in eq.([histo ] ) , the generating function for the mixed histogram distribution is defined by @xmath56 by construction the outgoing and incoming edges variables @xmath57 are statistically independent for @xmath16 fixed , so that the last expectation values factorize . as above we may derive an evolution equation by evaluating the contribution of the newly added vertex at time @xmath1",
    "this yields : @xmath58 its stationary limit is factorized : @xmath59 outgoing and incoming edges are statistically independent at large time .",
    "in this section , we present the main relations governing the probability distributions of connected components of the graphs .",
    "two vertices belong to the same connected component if they can be joined by a path made of edges , without any reference to orientation .",
    "this definition ensures that the property of being in the same connected component is an equivalence relation , but does not ensure that two points in a connected component can be joined by an oriented path .    to partly avoid repetitions , the term _ cluster _ is used as a synonymous for _ connected component _ in the sequel .",
    "intuitively , the fact that the network is fragmented can be understood as follows : when a vertex @xmath60 is created , it has a finite probability to be isolated , and the probability that none of the vertices @xmath61 connects to vertex @xmath60 is @xmath62 which scales as @xmath63 .",
    "this quantity remains finite as long as @xmath64 does .",
    "this argument shows that there are isolated vertices in the system .",
    "a small extension of the argument shows that there are also finite components and that young vertices are more likely to be in small components than old ones .",
    "this will be made more rigourous in the study of profiles , see section [ sec : chropro ] .",
    "let @xmath65 be the number of connected components with @xmath19 vertices at time @xmath1 and let @xmath66 be the generating function , @xmath67 by definition , @xmath68 is the number of components and @xmath69 the total number of vertices , @xmath70 at any finite time .",
    "let us write an evolution equation for @xmath66 . at time @xmath71",
    ", we add the vertex with label @xmath71 which may then be connected to @xmath72 connected components of size @xmath19 .",
    "this creates a new component of size @xmath73 , but also removes @xmath72 components of size @xmath19 .",
    "thus , at time @xmath71 we have : @xmath74 with @xmath75 the kronecker symbol .",
    "alternatively , @xmath76    as is apparent from this formulation , the transition probability from a given @xmath66 to a given @xmath77 can be given in closed form . to be precise ,",
    "the admissible @xmath66 s ( describing the accessible distributions of components at time @xmath1 ) are polynomials with integral non - negative coefficients , whose derivative at @xmath78 have value @xmath1 .",
    "now suppose @xmath66 and @xmath77 are admissible . if the difference @xmath79 can not be written as @xmath80 for some set of nonnegative integers @xmath72 , the transition is forbidden .",
    "if it can , then the @xmath72 s are uniquely defined and the transition probability is @xmath81 the meaning of this equation is simple . at time @xmath71 , the new vertex is added , and for each of the former @xmath1 points a ( biased ) coin is tossed to decide the value of the edge variables @xmath82 .",
    "the tossings are independent with the same law , so the probability that the new point does not attach to a given component of size @xmath19 is @xmath83 , and distinct components are independent .",
    "hence for each @xmath19 one makes @xmath65 independent bernoulli trials with failure probability @xmath83 , and the transition from @xmath84 requires exactly @xmath72 successes .",
    "this shows that the graph evolution is a ( time inhomogeneous ) markov process on the space of components distributions , a fact that we shall use for the purpose of numerical simulations .",
    "this explicit representation of the transition probability could be used to average equation ( [ ntbis ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can represent the number @xmath72 of components of size @xmath19 which are connected to the new vertex in terms of the edge variables @xmath5 as @xmath85=1}^{n_k(t)}[1 - \\prod_{j\\in[k]}(1-\\ell_{j , t+1})]\\ ] ] where @xmath86 $ ] runs over connected components of size @xmath19 . since the edge variables @xmath82 are statistically independent of the earlier edge variables , @xmath87 with @xmath88 , and therefore also independent of the @xmath65 s , we have for any @xmath89 , @xmath90^{n_k(t ) } \\rangle } \\label{ndist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath91 we can now take the average value of eq.([ntbis ] ) to get @xmath92^{n_k(t ) }",

    "this in particular implies that for any finite size @xmath19 the number of connected components of size @xmath19 scales thermodynamically with the graph size .",
    "if both sides of eq.([nmoyen ] ) are expended in powers of @xmath98 , a given degree involves only components of bounded ( @xmath1-independent ) size .",
    "so , order by order in @xmath98 , self - averaging applies and we conclude that taking @xmath99 , the following is an accurate approximation for the last term in eq.([nmoyen ] ) at large times : @xmath100^{n_k(t ) } \\simeq_{t\\to \\infty } \\exp(-{\\alpha}+{\\alpha}\\sum_{k\\geq 1}kz^kc_k).\\ ] ] the averaged evolution equation ( [ nmoyen ] ) then gives a deterministic differential equation @xmath101 for the generating function @xmath102 the function @xmath103 has a direct probabilistic interpretation .",
    "indeed , @xmath104 is the fraction of points in clusters of size @xmath19 , or equivalently the probability that a randomly chosen vertex belongs to a connected component of size @xmath19",
    ".    by construction @xmath105 is a taylor series with positive coefficients .",
    "the series @xmath106 is convergent because it counts the fraction of points in finite clusters which is @xmath107 . as a consequence",
    "the radius of convergence of @xmath105 is at least @xmath0 : if we denote by @xmath108 the radius of convergence @xmath105 , we know that @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "we show in appendix a that analogous methods can be used to describe the connected components of the erds - renyi random graph model .",
    "most of our subsequent analysis will be based on ( [ cdiff ] ) .",
    "it recursively determines the @xmath96 s .",
    "the first few are : @xmath111 more generally , the combinations @xmath112 are rational functions in @xmath2 .",
    "they are more efficiently computed using a second order differential equation which follows from derivation of the logarithm of eq.([cdiff ] ) : @xmath113 this leads to @xmath114 a general feature of the recursion relations is that the rational function @xmath112 has no poles except possibly at the points @xmath115 .",
    "eq.([nmoyen ] ) is not a closed formula for the probability distributions of the number of connected components .",
    "but as shown in appendix b , one may improve slightly the above argument to obtain a closed system ( see eq.[mast ] ) which can be used to prove systematically that the variables @xmath96 are self - averaging , a task we perform for @xmath116 and @xmath117 in appendix b. the proof becomes more and more tedious for large @xmath19 .",
    "but we are confident that the self averaging property is general because of the close relationship with the erds - renyi model presented in appendix a.",
    "up to now , our analysis of connected components has always concentrated on finite components : the thermodynamic limit @xmath118 has been taken while keeping @xmath19 , the component size , arbitrary but fixed .",
    "we have argued that in this regime , the number of components of size @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "this has lead to a satisfactory description of @xmath96 .",
    "our arguments did not use any hypothesis on whether or not only finite components play a role in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , as we observed already , the sum @xmath119 measures exactly the fraction of the sites that are either isolated or in components of size @xmath120 or @xmath121 or @xmath122 . to rephrase it more vaguely , @xmath119 counts the fraction of vertices that belong to finite connected components . if only clusters of finite size contribute to the thermodynamic limit , then @xmath123 . else , by standard physical arguments , a single giant component of size @xmath124 accounts for the deficit .",
    "the giant component is also called the percolating cluster .",
    "its relative size , which we denote by @xmath125 , is @xmath126     and @xmath127 .",

    ", the convergence of the series is slow for the whole relevant range of @xmath2 .",
    "the result of such a partial summation @xmath129 is plotted in fig.[fig : perconum ] for @xmath130 .",
    "it reveals a phase transition at a value @xmath131 between @xmath132 and @xmath133 , going from a regime where finite components contain all vertices to a regime where they do not .",
    "below @xmath132 and above @xmath133 , the plots corresponding to different values of @xmath134 are hard to distinguish , but in the transition region , large values of @xmath19 make substantial contributions to @xmath135 .",
    "the transition is also manifest on an analogous study of @xmath136 .",
    "we shall show later that @xmath137 is the exact threshold in this model and that @xmath136 is discontinuous at the transition .",
    "the growth of @xmath125 just above the threshold seems to start with many vanishing derivatives , in strong contrast with what happens in the erds - renyi random graph , for which the growth of the giant component is linear close to the transition .",
    "this can be related to the following observations :     as we have recalled in appendix a , in the erds - renyi model the components of size @xmath19 occupy a fraction @xmath138 . as a function of @xmath2 ,",
    "this fraction has a single maximum at @xmath139 .",
    "these values accumulate at @xmath140 , the well - known transition point for the standard random graph .",
    "then for @xmath141 , the fraction of sites occupied by components of size @xmath19 decreases with a finite slope for all @xmath19 s , and so does the sum , so that the growth of the giant component is linear close to the transition .",
    " in the model studied in this paper , the behavior of @xmath142 as a function of @xmath2 for generic @xmath19 is not so easy to get at .",
    "however , a simple numerical analysis leads to the following picture : @xmath143 is a decreasing function of @xmath2 , but for @xmath144 , @xmath104 has a single maximum , at say @xmath145 .",
    "this sequence starts with @xmath146 , @xmath147 @xmath148 , is maximum for @xmath149 with @xmath150 and then decreases very slowly ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) , apparently getting closer and closer to @xmath137 . at the transition",
    ", most @xmath142 s are still increasing , and close enough to the transition a finite but large number of them is still increasing .",
    "so subtle compensation mechanisms can take place , leading possibly to the vanishing of ( infinitely ) many derivatives of @xmath125 at @xmath154 .",
    "this is confirmed in the following subsections , which are also devoted to a more precise description of the distributions of finite and infinite clusters .",
    "to summarize : @xmath155",
    "we turn to the examination of the consequences of eq.([cdiff ] ) , the equation that determines the generating function for the number of clusters of given finite size .    we know that @xmath108 , the radius of convergence of @xmath105 , is at least @xmath0 . to analyze the behavior of @xmath105 around @xmath78",

    "this translates into the boundary condition @xmath163      we first look for a formal solution @xmath164 of eq.([feq ] ) in the form of a taylor series in @xmath165 : @xmath166 the taylor coefficients are the moments of the measure @xmath104 : @xmath167 .",
    "for example @xmath168 is the average proportion of vertices per component . as eq.([cd2 ] ) the differential equation eq.([cdiff ] ) may be turned into a second order differential equation for @xmath169 , @xmath170 eq.([cdiff ] ) with @xmath171 gives @xmath172 .",
    "eq.([ydiff ] ) then allows us to recursively compute the @xmath173 s : @xmath174 with @xmath175 the square root singularity in the expression of @xmath168 indicates that the initial boundary condition ( [ mesp ] ) becomes pathological at @xmath154 and thus signals the percolation transition .",
    "the recursion relation for the higher taylor coefficients shows that @xmath176 possesses a pole at @xmath177 .",

    "indeed , the differential equation ( [ feq ] ) is compatible with an expansion of @xmath162 for @xmath192 , @xmath193 , of the form : @xmath194 with @xmath195 and @xmath196 . as a function of the complex variable @xmath98",
    ", @xmath197 has thus a branch cut starting at @xmath78 : @xmath198 for @xmath179 an integer , this formula should becomes @xmath199 .",

    "for very large @xmath1 , the number of arrows emerging from vertex @xmath205 grows like @xmath206 .",

    "our results are illustrated on fig.[fig : profinfin ] .",
    "random graphs of size @xmath495 . from top to bottom , the values of @xmath2 are @xmath0 , @xmath496 and @xmath497.__,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    to conclude this discussion , let us observe that @xmath486 can be expressed in terms of the profiles of finite components that we studied before : @xmath498 with @xmath499 defined in eq.([defrhoz ] ) . we end up with yet another equation constraining @xmath499 , @xmath500    if we expand @xmath501 in powers of @xmath502 as @xmath503 and define @xmath504 , we can check that @xmath505 in particular , by differentiation this implies that @xmath506 the resemblance with equations ( [ cdiff ] ) and ( [ crecur ] ) for the function @xmath105 is rather striking , but we have not been able to use this more deeply .",
    "one difference is that ( [ cdiff ] ) determines @xmath116 from scratch , whereas ( [ ddiff ] ) does it in a two step process .",
    "if @xmath507 is the solution of this equation satisfying @xmath508 , then @xmath509 , and then @xmath510 has to satisfy @xmath511 another difference is that the sequence @xmath512 alternates in sign .",
    "again , the formal parameter @xmath98 receives a simple physical interpretation @xmath513 where @xmath44 labels the relative date of birth of vertices .",
    "in this study , we have described detailed global and local - in - time features of evolving random graphs with uniform attachment rules .    concerning global properties , we have shown that the model has a percolation phase transition at @xmath154 .",
    "below the transition , the system contains clusters whose sizes scale like @xmath514 . above the transition , a single component , the giant component , grows steadily with time .",
    "we have shown that , close to the threshold , the fraction of sites in the giant component has an essential singularity and behaves as @xmath515 .",
    "the behaviors below and above the transitions are strongly reminiscent of the two dimensional @xmath516 model , so that our model can be interpreted as some algorithmic equivalent of it , but it seems unlikely that a direct connexion exists .",
    "this analogy and further scaling properties we present call for an alternative renormalization group approach to the transition .    by describing local - in - time profiles ,",
    "we have shown that they offer a more accurate vision of the specificities of evolving graphs .",
    "it would be desirable to generalize this approach by answering the following question : assume that a procedure to assign ages to the vertices of some evolving graphs has been given , what informations on the microscopic evolution rules of these graphs can be decoded from the knowledge of local - in - time statistics  ?",
    "aknowledgements : we thank gilles schaeffer for his clarifying help in tree generating functions and sergei dorogovtsev for his comments and interest .",
    "we show how our arguments of section [ sec : clusters ] can be modified to describe the erds - renyi random graph model . in this model ,",
    "one starts with @xmath178 points , and any two points are connected by an edge with probability @xmath517 ( so in this model all the points are equivalent ) . then a limit @xmath518 is taken .",
    "this famous model describes a static graph , but it can also be rephrased as an evolving graph in the following way : set @xmath519 and suppose that points are added one by one , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , each new point connecting to any previous one with probability @xmath520 . from this point of view , it can be seen that looking only at the first @xmath205 vertices ( @xmath521 ) amount to look at an erds - renyi random graph with a modified connectivity parameter @xmath522 . to get a recursion relation , we start from an erds - renyi random graph of size @xmath1 with connectivity parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we add vertex @xmath71 and connect any older vertex to it with probability @xmath523 , so that the effective connectivity parameter for the graph on @xmath71 vertices is @xmath524 .",
    "then the derivation proceeds as before , with the little proviso that in eq.([nmoyen ] ) , on the left - hand side @xmath525 has an effective connectivity parameter @xmath524 instead of @xmath2 .",
    "so when we take the thermodynamic limit , nothing changes on the right - hand side of ( [ nmoyen ] ) , but an additional term @xmath526 contributes to the left - hand side . if @xmath527 denotes the analog of @xmath465 but for the erds - renyi random graph , then @xmath528    this little modification in the equation has drastic consequences .",
    "the new equation has a single solution regular at @xmath529 , namely @xmath530 which is the well - known result .",
    "we conclude that our self - averaging hypothesis is valid for the erds - renyi model .",
    "this makes it more plausible that it works for our original model as well , a fact also confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "our goal is to prove the following formula and to investigate a few of its consequences .",
    "we claim that @xmath531^{n_m(t ) }   \\rangle } \\label{mast}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the contour integral is around the origin .",
    "it is a fokker - planck equation for the markov process formed by the @xmath65 s , which could be used to prove systematically that the variables @xmath96 are self - averaging , a task we perform for @xmath116 and @xmath117 at the end of this appendix .",
    "we start from eq.([nt ] ) which may be rewritten as @xmath532 to compute the last term we insert the tautological identity @xmath533 in the r.h.s . to get @xmath534 to compute the r.h.s .",
    "expectation value we use a contour integral representation of the kronecker symbol @xmath535 this yields @xmath536 the r.h.s .",
    "can now be computed using eq.([ndist ] ) and gives eq.([mast ] ) .",
    "this computation has a rather simple combinatorial reinterpretation .",
    "we set @xmath537 and observe that going from time @xmath1 to @xmath71 , we add vertex @xmath71 and edges from the rest of the graph to @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that the component of vertex @xmath71 has size say @xmath19 .",
    "this component was build by `` eating '' some components of the graph at time @xmath1 .",
    "a component of size @xmath16 is swallowed with probability @xmath538 and survives with probability @xmath539 .",
    "on the other hand , if one expands @xmath540 in powers of @xmath541 , the term of degree @xmath542 enumerates all the possibilities to build the component of vertex @xmath71 with the correct probability .",
    "defining @xmath543 , summation over @xmath19 gives @xmath544 as obtained previously .",
    "the fokker - planck eq.([mast ] ) may also be formulated as a difference equation , similar to a discrete schrodinger equation .",
    "let us for instance specify it for @xmath545 with @xmath546 , @xmath547 , a set of complex numbers and let @xmath548^{n_k(t ) }   \\rangle } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this parametrization is similar to that used in matrix theory where @xmath549 may be thought of as the trace of the @xmath550 power of matrix whose eigenvalues are the @xmath546 s .",
    "the contour integral in eq.([mast ] ) can then be explicitly evaluated by deforming the integration contour to pick the simple pole contributions located at the points @xmath551 .",
    "this gives : @xmath552    eq.([mast ] ) or ( [ diffshro ] ) may be used to prove that the numbers @xmath96 are self - averaging .",
    "let us choose for example two parameters @xmath553 and @xmath554 .",
    "then , only the clusters of size @xmath0 give a non trivial contribution to @xmath555 at large time so that @xmath556 at large time , the difference equation ( [ diffshro ] ) then reduces to a differential equation for @xmath557 , @xmath558 it implies that @xmath559 is linear in @xmath98 at large time which means that @xmath116 is self - averaging and stationary at large time .",
    "more precisely , integrating the above equation gives : @xmath560 in agreement with eq.([lesc ] ) .",
    "similarly , to prove that @xmath117 possesses a finite self - averaging limit as @xmath561 we choose three parameters @xmath553 , @xmath562 so that only clusters of size two survive in @xmath555 at large time , @xmath563 eq.([diffshro ] ) then gives a first order differential equation for @xmath564 which implies that @xmath565 in agreement with eq.([lesc ] ) .",
    "although we do not have a global argument this proof may clearly be extended to recursively prove self - averageness of any @xmath96 by choosing the parameters @xmath566 with @xmath567 .",
    "here we present the proof of eq.([gscal ] ) . let us first recall lagrange formula . consider a variable @xmath568 defined by the implicit relation @xmath569 for some given analytic function @xmath301 .",
    "the solution of this equation is supposed to be unique so that @xmath568 is function of @xmath570 . given another analytic function @xmath571 we look for the taylor series in @xmath570 of @xmath572 .",
    "this composed function may be presented as a contour integral : @xmath573 expanding the integrated rational function in taylor series in @xmath570 gives lagrange formula : @xmath574    let @xmath575 .",
    "eq.([eqgc ] ) translates into @xmath576 or @xmath577 for @xmath578 and @xmath579 .",
    "we now apply lagrange formula with @xmath580 and @xmath581 .",
    "this gives @xmath582 with @xmath583 and @xmath578 , this proves eq.([gscal ] ) ."
