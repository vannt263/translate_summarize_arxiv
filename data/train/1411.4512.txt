    "randomness is a vital resource in many information and communications technology applications , such as computer simulations , statistics , gaming , and cryptography . for applications that are not concerned with the security and uniqueness of randomness",
    ", a sequence with uniformly distributed numbers mostly suffices .",
    "such sequences can be generated using a pseudorandom - number generator ( prng ) that works via certain deterministic algorithm .",
    "although prngs can offer highly unbiased random numbers , they can not be used for applications that require information security for two reasons : first , prng - generated sequences are unpredictable only under limitations of computational power , since prngs are inherently based on deterministic algorithms .",
    "second , the random seeds , which are required to define the initial state of a prng , limit the amount of entropy in the random - number sequences they generate .",
    "this compromises the security of an encryption protocol .    for cryptographic applications @xcite ,",
    "a random sequence is required to be truly unpredictable and to have maximum entropy . to achieve this ,",
    "intensive efforts have been devoted to developing high - speed hardware rngs that generate randomness via physical noise @xcite .",
    "hardware rngs are attractive alternatives because they provide fresh randomness based on physical processes that are apparently unpredictable ( i.e.  uncorrelated with any existing information either with past settings or side information ) .",
    "moreover , they also provide a solution to the problem of having insufficient entropy .",
    "because of the deterministic nature of classical physics , however , some of these hardware generators may be only truly random under practical assumptions that can not be validated .",
    "rngs that rely on quantum processes ( qrngs ) , on the other hand , can have guaranteed indeterminism and entropy , since quantum processes are inherently unpredictable @xcite .",
    "examples of such processes include quantum phase fluctuations @xcite , spontaneous emission noise @xcite , photon arrival times @xcite , stimulated raman scattering @xcite , photon polarization state @xcite , vacuum fluctuations @xcite , and even mobile phone cameras @xcite .",
    "these qrngs resolve both shortcomings of the prngs .",
    "however , despite their reliance on entropy which is ultimately guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics , measurements on quantum systems are often tainted by classical noise .",
    "we quantify the amount of quantum randomness to the amount of classical noise using a quantum - to - classical - noise ratio ( qcnr ) .",
    "when qcnr is low , both the quality and the security of the random sequence generated may be compromised @xcite .    to address this issue , gabriel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite took into account potential eavesdropping on the classical noise by considering the channel capacity of their qrng .",
    "their setup exhibited a good qcnr clearance and was able to extract approximately 3 bits per sample of guaranteed randomness out of 5 bits of digitization ( approximately 60% ) .",
    "more recently , ma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a framework for qrng entropy evaluation . by using _ min - entropy _ as the quantifier for randomness",
    ", they extracted a higher rate of random bits of 6.7 bits per sample from 8 bits ( approximately 84% ) , where the quantum contribution of the randomness was obtained by inferring the qcnr .    in the process of generating random bits via measuring continuous - variable systems ,",
    "an analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) is commonly used to discretize the measurement outcomes .",
    "it has been speculated @xcite that the freedom of choosing the adc range could be exploited to optimize extractable randomness .",
    "meanwhile , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the choice of dynamical adc range was justified by experimental observations .",
    "thus , a systematic approach to determine the dynamical adc range in extracting a maximum amount of secure randomness is very much required .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a new generic framework where the dynamical adc range can be appropriately chosen to deliver maximum randomness . by quantifying randomness via min - entropy conditioned on classical noise , we show that qcnr is not the sole limiting factor in generating secure random bits .",
    "in fact , by carefully optimizing the dynamical adc range , one can extract a nonzero amount of secure randomness even when the classical noise is larger than the quantum noise . by applying this method to our continuous - variable ( cv ) qrng based on a homodyne measurement of vacuum state @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate that the setup is capable of delivering more than 70  gbps of secure random bits .",
    "recently , certifiable randomness based on a violation of fundamental inequalities has been proposed and demonstrated @xcite .",
    "these devices do not rely on the assumption of a trusted device .",
    "the generated bits can be certified as random based on the measured correlations alone and independent from the internal structure of the generator . however , achieving a high generation rate with such devices is experimentally challenging .",
