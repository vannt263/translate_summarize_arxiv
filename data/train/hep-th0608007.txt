    "perturbative gauge theory and gravity in four dimensions are quite dissimilar from a dynamical viewpoint .",

    "arguments based on power counting within unitary cuts suggest that the first counter term in maximal supergravity@xcite is expected at five loops@xcite .",
    "recently , initiated by the duality between gauge theories and a twister string theory@xcite , there has been much progress in the computation of amplitudes in gauge theory . in this talk we discuss how these ideas may be applied to gravity calculations and the results thereof .",
    "we will first review the recent progress in computing physical on - shell tree amplitudes for gravity theories particularly focusing on the on - shell recursion relations@xcite and the mhv - vertex construction@xcite .",

    "graviton scattering amplitudes are extremely difficult to evaluate using conventional feynman diagram techniques . in this section",

    "1 ) * gravity amplitudes can be constructed through the kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt)-relations@xcite as squares of gauge theory amplitudes .",
    "the klt relations are inspired by the nave string theory relation @xmath6 and have the explicit form , up to five points , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the tree - level colour - ordered gauge theory partial amplitudes .",
    "we suppress factors of @xmath9 in the @xmath8 and @xmath10 in the @xmath11 .",
    "the klt relations are helpful in the calculation of gravity tree amplitudes , however they have some undesirable features .",
    "the factorisation structure is not manifest and the expressions do not tend to be compact , as the permutation sums grow rather quickly with @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , the berends , giele and kuijf ( bgk ) form of the mhv gravity amplitude@xcite , @xmath13\\ , , \\cr } \\]]is rather more compact than that of the klt sum ( as is the expression in @xcite . ) in the above we use the definitions , @xmath14 \\;\\equiv\\ ; \\sum_{a = i}^j\\spb k.a\\spa a.l\\,,$ ] and @xmath15 . in terms of the above weyl spinors we often use twistor variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the mhv amplitudes for graviton scattering display a feature not shared by the yang - mills expressions , they depend not only on the holomorphic variables @xmath18 , but also on the anti - holomorphic @xmath19 variables ( within the @xmath20 for the klt expression ) .    *",
    "2 ) * in a recent computational approach for amplitudes , britto , cachazo , feng and witten@xcite obtained on - shell recursion relations for trees .",
    "the recursion relations are based on factorisation properties of amplitudes and are thus applicable to a wide range of theories and in particular to gravity@xcite .",
    "the technique is based on analytically shifting a pair of external legs , @xmath21 and on determining the physical amplitude , @xmath22 , from the poles in the shifted amplitude , @xmath23.this leads to a recursion relation of the form , @xmath24 where the factorisation is only on these poles , @xmath25 , where legs @xmath26 and @xmath27 are connected to different sub - amplitudes .",
    "an essential condition for the recursion relations is that the shifted amplitude @xmath23 vanishes for large @xmath28 .",
    "whereas proven for gauge theory amplitudes a general proof ( for arbitrary helicities@xcite ) in gravity is an open problem .",
    "recursion relations based on the analyticity in the complex plane can also be used at loop level both to calculate rational terms@xcite and the coefficients of integral functions@xcite .    *",
    "3 ) * finally , we would like to mention the csw construction@xcite of amplitudes and its generalisation to gravity@xcite .",

    "inspired by the duality in @xcite , considerable progress has recently been made in determining such coefficients , @xmath68 , using a variety of methods based on unitarity@xcite .    for @xmath1 supergravity",

    "there is evidence that all one - loop amplitudes of @xmath1 , like the @xmath0 amplitudes eq .",
    "( [ onlyboxeseq ] ) , can be expressed as a sum over scalar box integrals , the so called `` no - triangle hypothesis''@xcite .",
    "firstly , in the few definite computations at one - loop level , triangle or bubble functions do not appear .",
    "the first computation was of the four - point amplitude@xcite where only box functions appear ( although this is consistent with power counting ) .",
    "beyond this computations of the five and six point mhv - amplitudes yielded only scalar box - functions@xcite .",
    "secondly , the factorisation properties of physical amplitudes do not demand the presence of these functions .",
    "since the four and five point amplitudes are triangle - free then in any factorisation limit of a higher point function the triangles must vanish . in this spirit",
    "an ansatz for the @xmath12-point mhv amplitude was constructed@xcite entirely of box functions consistent in all soft limits .",

    "the `` no - triangle '' hypothesis applies to one - loop amplitudes .",
    "however , by factorisation it should have implications beyond one - loop suggesting the uv behaviour of maximal supergravity may be significantly milder than expected from power counting .",
