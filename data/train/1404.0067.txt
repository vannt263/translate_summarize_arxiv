    "social network analysis is the study of the structure of relationships linking individuals ( or other social units , such as organizations ) and of interdependencies in behavior or attitudes related to configurations of social relations .",
    "the observational units in a social network are the relationships between individuals and their attributes . whereas studies in medicine typically involve individuals whose observations",
    "can be thought of as statistically independent , observations made on social networks may be simultaneously dependent on all other observations due to the social ties and pathways linking them .",
    "accordingly , different statistical techniques are needed to analyze social network data .",
    "the focus of this chapter is _ sociocentric data _ , the case when relational data is available for all pairs of individuals , allowing a fully - fledged review of available methods .",
    "two major questions in social network analysis are : 1 ) do behavioral and other mutable traits spread from person - to - person through a process of induction ( also known as _ social influence _ , _ peer effects _ , or _ social contagion _ ) ; 2 ) what exogeneous factors ( e.g. , shared actor traits ) or endogeneous factors ( e.g. , internal configurations of actors such as triads ) are important to the overall structure of relationships among a group of individuals .",
    "the first problem has affinity to medical studies in that individuals are the observational units . in medicine ,",
    "the health of an individual is paramount and so individual outcomes have historically been used to judge the effectiveness of an intervention .",
    "a study of social influence in medicine may involve the same outcome but the treatment or intervention is the same variable evaluated on the peers of the focal individual ( referred to as _ alters _ ) .",
    "an important characteristic of studies of social influence is that individuals may partly or fully share treatments and one individual s treatment may depend on the outcome of another .",
    "for example , an intervention that encourages person a to exercise in order to lose weight might also influence the weight of a s friends ( b and c ) because they exercise more when around a. hence , a s weight intervention may also affect the weight of b and c. a consequence is that the total effect of a s treatment must also consider it s effect on b and c , the benefit to individuals to whom b and c are connected , and so on . such _ interference _ between observations violates the stable - unit treatment value assumption ( sutva ) that one individuals treatment not affect anothers outcome @xcite , which presents challenges for identification of causal effects .",
    "interference is likely to result in an incongruity between a regression parameter and the causal effect that would be estimated in the absence of interference .",
    "the second problem is important in sociology as social networks are thought to reveal the structure of a group , organization , or society as a whole @xcite .",
    "for example , there has always been great interest in determining whether the triad is an important social unit @xcite .",
    "if the existence of network ties a - b and a - c makes the presence of network tie b - c more likely then the network exhibits _ transitivity _ , commonly described as `` a friend of a friend is a friend '' .",
    "thus , just as an individual may influence or be influenced by multiple others , the relationship status of one dyad ( pair of individuals ) may affect the relationship status of another dyad , even if no individuals are common to multiple dyads .",
    "accounting for between dyad dependence is a core component of many social network analyses and has entailed much methodological research .",
    "network science is a parallel field to social network analysis in that there is very little overlap between researchers in the respective fields despite the similiarity of the problems . whereas solutions to problems in social networks have tended to be data - oriented in that models and statistical tests are based on the data , those in network science have tended to be phenomenon - oriented with analogies to problems in the physical sciences often providing the backbone for solutions .",
    "methods for social network analysis often have causal hypotheses ( e.g. , does one individual have an effect on another , does the presence of a common friend make friendship formation more likely ) motivating them and involving micro - level modeling .",
    "in contrast , methods in network science seek models generated from some theoretical basis that reproduce the network at a global or system level and in so - doing reveal features of the data generating process ( e.g. , is the network scale - free , does the degree - distribution follow a power - law ) .",
    "one of the goals of this chapter is to address the lack of interaction between the social network and network science fields by providing the first joint review of both . by enlarging the range of methods at the disposal of researchers , advances at the frontier of networks and health",
    "will hopefully accelerate .",
    "the computer age has enabled widespread implementation of methods for social network and network science analysis , particularly statistical models . at the same time , a diverse range of applications of social network analysis have appeared , including in medicine . because many medical and health - related phenomena involve interdependent actors ( e.g. patients , nurses , physicians , and hospitals ) , there is enormous potential for social network analysis to advance health services research @xcite .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the chapter is as follows .",
    "this introductory section concludes with a brief historical account of social networks and network science is given .",
    "the major types of networks and methods for representing networks are then discussed ( section 2 ) . in section 3 formal notation",
    "is introduced and descriptive measures for networks are reviewed . social influence and social selection",
    "are studied in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "our focus switches to methods akin with network science in section 6 , where descriptive methods are discussed .",
    "the review of network science methods continues with community detection methods in section 7 and generative models in section 8 .",
    "the chapter concludes in section 9 .      in the 1930 s ,",
    "a field of study involving human interactions and relationships emerged simultaneously from sociology , psychology , and anthropology .",
    "moreno is credited for inventing the sociogram @xcite , a visual display of social structure .",
    "the appeal of the sociogram led to moreno being considered a founder of sociometry , a precursor to the field known as _",
    "social networks_. a number of mathematical analyses of network - valued random variables in the form of sociograms followed @xcite .",
    "other important contributions were to structural balance @xcite ; the diffusion of medical innovations @xcite ; structural equivalence @xcite ; and social influence @xcite",
    ". refer to for a detailed historical account .",
    "early network studies involved small networks with defined boundaries such as students in a classroom , or a few large entities such as countries engaging in international trade . because the typical number of individuals in such studies was small ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) , relationships could be determined for all possible pairs of individuals yielding complete _ sociocentric _ datasets .",
    "furthermore , the often enclosed nature of the system ( e.g. , a classroom or commune ) reduced the risk of confounding by external factors ( e.g. , unobserved actors ) .    sociological theory developed over time as sociologists provided intuitive reasoning to support various hypotheses involving social networks and society @xcite . in the specific area of individual health , at least five principal mediating pathways through which social relationships and thus social networks may influence outcomes have been posited @xcite .",
    "prominent among these is social support , which has emotional , instrumental , appraisal ( assistance in decision making ) , and informational aspects @xcite . beyond social support , networks may also offer access to tangible resources such as financial assistance or transportation .",
    "they can also convey social influence by defining norms about such health - related behaviors as smoking or diet , or via social controls promoting ( for example ) adherence to medication regimes @xcite .",
    "networks are also channels through which certain communicable diseases , notably sexually transmitted ones , spread @xcite and certain network structures have been hypothesized to reduce exposure to stressors @xcite .    a field known as mathematical sociology complemented social theory by attempting to derive results using mathematical rather than intuitive arguments .",
    "in particular , statistical and probability methods are used to test for the presence of various structural features in the network .",
    "other key areas of mathematics that have been used in network analysis include graph theory and algebraic models .",
    "develop tests of dependence within dyads ( pairs of actors ) while ( ) develop tests of triadic dependence .",
    "in general , results were descriptive or based on simple models making strong assumptions about the network . with the advent of powerful computers ,",
    "mathematical contributions have taken on more importance as so much more can be implemented that in the past .",
    "for example , computer simulation has recently been used to test and develop theoretical results @xcite .    in the mid - late 1990s ,",
    "network science emerged as a discipline . whereas social networks were the domain of social scientists and a growing number of statisticians ,",
    "network scientists typically have backgrounds in physics , computer science or applied mathematics .",
    "the use of physical concepts to generate solutions to problems is common as evinced by the large domains of research focusing on the adaptation of ( e.g. ) a particular physical equation to network data .",
    "for example , several procedures for partitioning a network into disjoint groups of individuals ( `` communities '' ) rely on the _ modularity _ equation , which was developed in the context of spin - theory to model the interaction of electrons .",
    "while much of the initial work focused on the properties of the solution at different values of the parameters there recently been has increased attention to using these methods to provide valuable insight on important practical problems .",
    "social networks are comprised of units and the relationships between them .",
    "the units are often individuals ( also referred to as _ actors _ ) but can include larger ( e.g. , countries , companies ) and smaller ( e.g. , organisms , genes ) entities .      in sociocentric studies ,",
    "data is assembled on the ties linking all units or actors within some bounded social collective @xcite .",
    "for example , the collection of data on the network of all children in a classroom or on all pairs of physician collaborations within a medical practice constitutes a sociocentric study .",
    "relationships can be shared or directional , and quantified by binary ( tie exists or not ) , scale ( or valued ) , or multivariate variables . by measuring all relationships , sociocentric data",
    "constitutes the highest level of information collection and facilitates an extensive range of analyses including accounting for the effects of multiple actors on actor outcomes or the structure of the network itself to be studied @xcite",
    ". a weaker form of relational data is collected in egocentric studies where individuals ( `` egos '' ) are sampled at random and information is collected on at least a sample of the individuals with direct ties to the egos ( `` alters '' ) . because standard statistical methods such as regression analysis can generally be used to analyze egocentric data , herein egocentric data are not featured .",
    "relational data is often binary ( e.g. , friend or non - friend ) .",
    "one reason is that other types of relational data ( e.g. , nominal , ordinal , interval - valued ) are often transformed to binary due to the convenience of displaying binary networks .",
    "another is the greater range of models available for modeling binary data .",
    "many studies involve two distinct types of units , such as patients and physicians , or physicians and hospitals , authors and journal articles or books , etc . in these two - mode networks",
    ", the elementary relationships of interest usually refer to affiliations of units in one set with those in the other ; e.g. , of patients with the physician(s ) responsible for their care , or of physicians with the hospital(s ) at which they are admitted to practice .",
    "two - mode networks are also known as affiliation or _",
    "_ networks .",
    "they can be viewed as a special - case of general sociocentric network data in that the relationship of interest is between heterogeneous types of actors .",
    "the advent of high - powered computers has enabled the analysis of large networks , which has benefitted fields such as health services research that regularly encounter large data sets .",
    "a challenge facing analyses of large networks is that it may be infeasible for all actors to be exposed to each other actor and thus for a relationship to have formed .",
    "therefore , statistical analyses for large networks essentially use relational data representing the joint event of individuals meeting and then forming a tie , not the network of ties that would be observed if all pairs of individuals actually met .",
    "accordingly , analyses of large networks may underestimate effect sizes unless information on the likelihood of two individuals meeting is incorporated .",
    "let the status of the relationship from @xmath1 to @xmath2 be denoted by @xmath3 , element @xmath4 of the adjacency matrix @xmath5 . in a directed network",
    "@xmath3 may differ from @xmath6 while in a non - directed network @xmath7 , implying @xmath8 .",
    "a network constructed from friendship nominations is likely to be directed while a network of coworkers is non - directed . in the case of immutable relationships ( e.g. , siblings ) ,",
    "@xmath9 will only change as actors are added or removed ( e.g. , through birth or death ) , as relationship status is otherwise invariant . in the following ,",
    "assume the network is binary unless otherwise stated .",
    "matrices and graphs are two common ways of representing the status of a networks at a fixed time . in a matrix representation ,",
    "rows and columns correspond to units or actors ; the matrix is square for one - mode and rectangular for two - mode networks",
    ". elements of the matrix contain the value of the relationship linking the corresponding units or actors , so that element @xmath4 represents the relationship from actor @xmath1 to actor @xmath2 . with binary ties ( 1 = tie present , 0 = tie absent ) ,",
    "the matrix representation is known as an adjacency matrix .",
    "irrespective of how the network is valued , the diagonal elements of the matrix representing the network equal 0 as self - ties are not permitted .",
    "several network properties can be computed through matrix operations .    .",
    "note : self - ties are not relevant in studies involving relationships.,width=432 ]    in graphical form , units or actors are vertices and non - null relationships are lines .",
    "non - directed relationships are known as `` edges '' and directed ones as `` arcs '' ; arrows at the end(s ) of arcs denote their directionality .",
    "value - weighted graphs can be constructed by displaying non - null tie values along arcs or edges , or by letting thinner and thicker lines represent line values .",
    "such graphical imagery is a hallmark of social network analysis @xcite .    two - mode ( or bipartite ) networks may be represented in set - theoretic form as hypergraphs consisting of a set of actors of one type , together with a collection of subsets of the actors defined on the basis of a common actor of the second type @xcite . this representation highlights the multi - party relationships that may exist among those actors of one type that are linked to a given actor of the other type ; e.g. , the set of all physicians affiliated with a particular clinic or service . in matrix form ,",
    "element @xmath4 of an affiliation matrix @xmath9 indicates that actor @xmath1 of the first type is linked to actor @xmath2 of the second type .",
    "affiliation networks may usefully be represented as bipartite graphs in which nodes are partitioned into two disjoint subsets and all lines link nodes in different sets .",
    "an induced one - mode network @xmath9 may be obtained by multiplying an affiliation matrix @xmath10 by its transpose , @xmath11 ; entry @xmath4 of the outer - product @xmath12 gives the number of affiliations shared by a pair of actors of one type ( see figure  [ fig : biparproj ] , which emulates a figure in ) .",
    "dually , the inner - product @xmath13 yields a one - mode network of shared affiliations among actors of the second type @xcite .",
    "the diagonals of the outer and inner matrix products give the degree of the actors ( i.e. , the number of ties to actors of the other mode ) .    )",
    "bipartite adjacency matrix @xmath10 .",
    "a one - mode projection of the doctor - patient network is obtained by multiplying the bipartite adjacency matrix @xmath10 by its transpose , @xmath14 , to yield a @xmath15 symmetric one - mode adjacency matrix @xmath9 , whose elements indicate the number of patients the two physicians have in common .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath9 correspond to the number of patients the given physician `` shares with themselves '' ( i.e. , the number of patients they care for).,width=432 ]    in health services applications , an investigator is often interested in a one - mode network that is not directly observed but rather is induced from a two - mode network .",
    "such one - mode projection networks are motivated theoretically by a claim that shared actors from the other mode act as surrogates for ties between the actors .",
    "for example , physicians with many patients in common might have heightened opportunities for contact through consultations or sharing of information about those patients and thus the number of shared patients is a surrogate for the actual extent of interaction between pairs of physicians .",
    "examples of provider ( physician , hospital , health service area ) networks obtained as one - mode projections of bipartite networks in health services research are given in ( ) .",
    "an often overlooked feature of bipartite network analysis is the mechanism by which network data is obtained .",
    "networks obtained from one - mode projections have different statistical properties from directly - observed one - mode networks .",
    "consider a patient - physician bipartite network and suppose a threshold is applied to the physician one - mode projection such that true social ties are assumed to exist or not according to whether one or more patients are shared .",
    "then a patient that visits three physicians is seen to induce ties between all three physicians .",
    "the same complete set of ties between the three physicians is also induced by three patients that each visit different pairs of the three physicians .",
    "however , the projection does not preserve the distinction ( see section  [ sec : bipar ] for further comment ) .",
    "the number of units or actors ( @xmath16 ) is known as the order of the network .",
    "a common network statistic is network density ( @xmath17 ) , defined as the number of ties across the network ( @xmath18 ) divided by the number of possible ties ; for directed networks @xmath19 and for non - directed networks @xmath20 .",
    "thus , density equals the mean value of the binary ( 1 , 0 ) ties across the network . the same definition can be used for general relational data , in which case the resulting measure is sometimes referred to as _",
    "strength_. while results in this chapter are generally presented for binary networks , corresponding measures for weighted networks often exist ( ) .",
    "the tendency for relationships to form between people having similar attributes is known as homophily .",
    "homophily involves subgroup - specific network density statistics . with high homophily according to some attribute , networks tend toward segregation by that attribute - the extreme case occurs when the network consists of separate components ( i.e. , no ties between actors in different components ) defined by levels of the attribute . in the other direction , one obtains a bipartite network where all ties are between different types of actors ( extreme heterophily ) .",
    "the out- and in - degree for an actor @xmath1 are the number of ties from , @xmath21 ( column sum ) , and to , @xmath22 ( row sum ) , actor @xmath1 .",
    "these are also referred to as _ expansiveness _ and _ popularity _ , respectively .",
    "for example , a positive correlation between out- and in - degree suggests that popular individuals are expansive .",
    "the number of ties ( or value of the ties ) in a network is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the mean degree ( or strength ) of an individual , implying the density of the network is given by @xmath25 .",
    "this result is not specific to in- or out - degree due to the fact that the total number of inward ties must equal the total number of outward ties , implying mean in - degree equals mean out - degree .",
    "the variance of the degree distribution measures the extent to which tie - density ( or connectedness ) varies across the network @xcite .",
    "often actors having higher degree have prominent roles in the network @xcite .",
    "a special type of homophily is the phenomenon where individuals form ties with individuals of similar degree , commonly referred to as _",
    "assortative mixing_. in directed networks , assortative mixing can be defined with respect to both out - degree and in - degree @xcite .",
    "the opposite scenario to a network with the same degree for all actors is a @xmath26-star  a network configuration with @xmath26 relationships are incident to the focal actor ( figure  [ fig : config ] )  in which there are no ties between the other actors .",
    "the length of a path between two actors through the network is defined as the number of ties traversed to get from one actor to the other .",
    "the elements of the adjacency matrix multiplied by itself @xmath27 times , denoted @xmath28 , equal the number of paths of length @xmath26 between any two actors with the number of @xmath26-cycles ( including multiple or repeated loops ) on the diagonal .",
    "the shortest path between two actors is referred to as the _ geodesic distance_.      certain subnetworks have particular theoretical prominence .",
    "the first step - up from the trivial single actor subnetwork , also known as an isolated node , is the network comprising two actors ( a `` dyad '' ) .",
    "the presence and magnitude of a tendency toward symmetry or reciprocity in a directed network can be measured by comparing the number of mutual dyads ( ties in both directions ) to the number expected under a null model that does not accommodate reciprocity .",
    "if the number of mutual dyads is higher than expected , there is a tendency towards reciprocation .",
    "a _ triad _ is formed by a group of three actors .",
    "figure  [ fig : config ] shows a `` transitive triad '' , so - named as it exhibits the phenomenon that a `` friend of a friend is a friend . '' non - parametric tests for the presence of transitivity or other forms of triadic dependence are based on the distribution of the number of closed and non - closed triads conditional on the number of null ( no ties intact ) , directed ( one tie intact ) , and mutual dyads ( both ties intact ) collectively known as the _ dyad census _ ; the degree distribution ; and other lower - order effects ( e.g. , homophily of relevant individual characteristics ) in the observed network . such tests are described in .",
    "centrality is the most common metric of an actor s prominence in the network and many distinct measures exist .",
    "they are often taken as indicators of an actor s network - based `` structural power . ''",
    "such measures are often used as explanatory variables in individual - level regression models .",
    "different centrality measures are characterized by the aspects of an actor s position in the network that they reflect .",
    "for example , degree - based centrality  the degree of an actor in an undirected network and in- or out - degree in a directed network  reflects an actor s level of network connectivity or involvement in the network .",
    "betweenness centrality computes the frequency with which an actor is found in an intermediary position along the geodesic paths linking pairs of other actors .",
    "actors with high betweenness centrality have high capacity to broker or control relationships among other actors . a third major centrality measure , closeness centrality ,",
    "is inversely - proportional to the sum of geodesic distances from a given actor to all others .",
    "the rationale underlying closeness measures is that actors linked to others via short geodesics have comparatively little need for intermediary units , and hence have relative independence in managing their relationships .",
    "closeness measures are defined only for networks in which all actors are mutually related to one another by paths of finite geodesic distance ; i.e. , single component networks .",
    "finally , eigenvalue centrality is sensitive to the presence or strength of connections , as well as those of the actors to which an actor is linked @xcite .",
    "it assumes that connections to central actors indicate greater prominence than do ( similar - strength ) connections to peripheral actors .",
    "the key component of the measure is the largest eigenvalue of an adjacency or other matrix representation of the network @xcite .",
    "network - level centrality indices @xcite are network - level statistics that resemble the degree variance whose values grow larger to the extent that a single actor is involved in all relationships ( as in the `` star '' network shown in figure  [ fig : config ] ) .",
    "the assignment of actors to groups is an important and growing field within social networks .",
    "the rationale for grouping actors is that it may reveal salient social distinctions that are not directly observed .",
    "the general statistical principle adhered to is that individuals within a group are more alike than individuals in different groups .",
    "groups are typically formed on the basis of network ties alone , the rationale being that the similarity of individuals positions in the network is in - part revealed by the pattern of ties involving them .",
    "thus , actors in densely connected parts of the network are likely to be grouped together .",
    "a related concept to a group is a clique , a maximal subset of actors having density 1.0 ( i.e. , ties exist between all pairs of individuals in a binary network ) .",
    "the larger the clique the stronger the evidence that the collective individuals are in the same group .",
    "grouping algorithms based on maximizing the ratio of within - group to between group ties are unlikely to split large cliques as doing so creates a lot of between group ties .",
    "however , a clique need not be its own group .    components of a network are defined by the non - existence of any paths between the actors in them . often a network is comprised of one large component and several small components containing few individuals .",
    "a more practical way of grouping individuals than by cliques is through @xmath26-connected components @xcite , a maximal subset of actors mutually linked to one another by at least @xmath26 node - independent paths ( i.e. , paths that involve disjoint sets of intermediary actors who also lie within the subgraph ) .",
    "such a criterion is related to @xmath26-coreness , a measure of the extent to which subgraphs with all internal degrees @xmath29 occur @xcite in a network .",
    "there are several other ways for grouping the actors in a network .",
    "model - based methods include mixed - membership stochastic block models @xcite and latent - class models in which the group is treated as a categorical individual - level latent variable @xcite while non - parametric methods used in network science include _ modularity _ and its variants .",
    "these methods are discussed in section  [ sec : physcd ] , where the grouping of actors is referred to as _ community detection_.      in practice two - mode networks are rarely directly analyzed .",
    "if one of the modes instigates ties or is of primary interest , the network involving just those actors is often analyzed as a single - mode network .",
    "for example , in a physician - patient referral network , the physicians often instigate ties through patient referrals while patients are chiefly responsible for who they see first . the projection from a two - mode network to a one - mode network links nodes in one mode ( e.g. , physicians )",
    "if they share a node of the other mode ( e.g. , patients ) . a weighted network can be formed with the number of shared actors of the other mode ( or function thereof ) as weights .    in describing networks obtained from a projection of a two - mode network ,",
    "the usual practice is to use unipartite descriptive measures .",
    "however , several layers of information are lost , including the number of actors in the other mode underlying a tie and the degree distribution of the actors in the other mode , from treating a one - mode projection as an actual network . even if the two - mode network is completely random , ties in a one - mode projection that arise from a single ( e.g. ) patient with ties to ( e.g. ) three physicians are not separate events .",
    "more generally , a patient who visits @xmath26-physicians generates a @xmath26-clique among those physicians and tells us nothing about whether physician sharing of one patient is correlated with physician sharing of another patient  the question of primary interest in the study of the diffusion of treatment practices .",
    "thus , @xmath26-cliques for @xmath30 may be excluded from measures of transitivity in two - mode networks .",
    "descriptive measures for two - mode networks may be computed that parallel those for one - mode networks @xcite .",
    "centrality measures based on the bipartite network representation are covered in .",
    "review visualization , subgroup detection , and measurement of centrality for two - mode network data .",
    "more descriptive measures for two - mode networks have recently been proposed .",
    "for example , a two - mode measure of transitivity defined as the ratio of the total number of six cycles ( closed paths of six ties through six nodes ) in the two - mode network divided by the total number of open five - paths through six nodes @xcite . in the context of the patient - physician network , _ physician transitivity _ exists if physicians a and b sharing a patient and physicians b and c sharing a patient makes it more likely for physicians a and c to share a patient .",
    "it is only if the two pairs of physicians have different patients in common that the physician triad may be transitive and only if the third pair share a different patient from the first two that the event can be attributed to transitivity .",
    "the involvement of distinct patients makes the physician - physician ties distinct events and thus informative about clustering of physicians ( and patients ) .    in general , the matrix equation @xmath11 in which a bipartite network adjacency matrix @xmath31 is multiplied by its transpose yields a weighted one - mode network ( the elements contain the number of shared actors of the other mode ) .",
    "to avoid losing information about the number of actors leading to a tie between primary nodes , weights can be retained or monotonically transformed in the projected network .",
    "weighted analogies of descriptive measures of binary networks can be evaluated on the weighted one - mode projection .",
    "for example , the calculation of degree is emulated by summing the weights of the edges involving an individual , yielding their _ strength_. degree and strength together distinguish between actors with many weak ties and those with a few strong ties .",
    "analogous measures of centrality can also be computed for the weighted one - mode projection @xcite . however , whether ties between @xmath26 physicians arise through them all treating the same patient , from each pair of physicians sharing a unique patient , or some in - between scenario can not be determined post - transformation ; thus , the projection transformation expends information .",
    "a further strategy is to set weights for the bipartite network prior to forming the projection .",
    "for example , in co - authorship networks , the tie connecting an author to a publication might receive a weight of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of authors on paper @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "( only papers with at least two authors are used to form such networks . )",
    "the rationale is that the greater the number of authors the lower the expected interaction between any pair ( a similar logic underlies the example weight matrix described in section  [ sec : influ ] ) .",
    "the sum of the weights across all publications common to two authors is then the basis of their relationship in the author network .",
    "if the events defining the bipartite network occur at different times ( e.g. , medical claims data often contain time - stamps for each patient - physician encounter ) a directed one - mode network may be formed",
    ". the value of the a - b and b - a ties in the physician - physician network could be the number of patients who visited a before b and b before a , respectively . in the resulting directed network",
    "each physician has a flow to and from each other physician .",
    "subsequent transformation of the flows to binary values yields dyads with states null , directed , and mutual as in a directed unipartite binary network .",
    "because medical claims and surveys are frequent sources of information about one entity s experience ( e.g. , a patient ) with another entity ( e.g. , a health plan or physician ) , bipartite network analysis is an area that promises to have enormous applicability to health services research .",
    "hence , new methods for bipartite network analysis are needed .",
    "we now consider the use of statistical models in social network analysis .",
    "particular emphasis is placed on methods for estimating social influence or peer effects and models for analyzing the network itself , including accounting for social selection through the estimation of effects of homophily .",
    "reported claims about peer effects of health outcomes such as bmi , smoking , depression , alcohol use , and happiness have recently tantalized the social sciences . in large part , the discussion and associated controversies have arisen from the statistical methods used to estimate peer effects @xcite .",

    "a common alternative model assumes @xmath61 ; in other words , that peer effects only act through the same variable in the alters as the outcome .",
    "another set of variants arises in the case when there are multiple types of alters with heterogeneous peer effects .",

    "the scenario depicted in figure  [ fig : netconfound ] does not present any major difficulties as long as effects involving individual @xmath26 are accounted .",
    "however , if individual @xmath26 is not known about or is ignored , then the analysis may be exposed to unmeasured confounding .",
    "this point has particular relevance to social network analyses as networks are often defined by specifying boundaries or rules for including individuals as opposed to being finite , closed systems @xcite . in situations where such boundaries break true ties ,",
    "influential peers may be excluded , potentially leading to biased results .      from a practical standpoint , it may be infeasible to use a model with only lagged predictors such as ( [ eq : dynam1 ] ) .",
    "for instance , the time points might be so far apart that statistical power is severely compromised .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to use a model with contemporaneous predictors such as : @xmath78 where adjusting for @xmath79 seeks to isolate the peer effect acting since @xmath76 .",
    "however , because @xmath80 is correlated with the outcome variables of other observations , ols will be inconsistent .",

    "the most widely cited of the christakis - fowler peer effect papers , the endogeneity problem is resolved using a novel theoretical argument .",
    "they purported that it is reasonable to assume in a friendship network that the influence acting on the focal actor ( the ego ) is greatest for mutual friendships , followed by ego - nominated friendships , followed by alter - nominated friendships , and finally is close to 0 in dyads with no friendships .",
    "furthermore , they reasoned that because unmeasured common causes should affect each dyad equally . because the estimated peer effects declined from large and positive for mutual friendships to close to 0 for alter and null friendships , consistent with their theory ,",
    "it was suggested that this constituted strong evidence of a peer effect . despite the compelling argument , revealed that unobserved factors affecting tie - formation ( homophily ) may confound the relationship and thus lead to biased effects .",
    "the estimation of peer effects is a topic of ongoing vigorous debate in the academic and the popular press .",
    "alternative approaches to the theory - based approach of christakis and fowler are now described .",
    "a parametric model - based solution to endogenous feedback is to specify a joint distribution for @xmath83 .",
    "then the reduced form of the model satisfies @xmath84 for @xmath38 to yield @xmath85 .",
    "the resulting model emulates a spatial autocorrelation model @xcite .",
    "one way of facilitating estimation is by specifying a probability distribution for @xmath86 .",
    "however , relying on the correctness of the assumed distribution for identification may make the estimation procedure sensitive to an erroneous assumed distribution .",
    "a semi - parametric solution is to find an instrumental variable ( iv ) , @xmath87 ; a variable that is related to @xmath80 but conditional on @xmath80 and @xmath88 does not cause @xmath34 . if @xmath89 is excluded from ( [ eq : dynamcf ] ) , its elements can potentially be used as ivs @xcite .",
    "however , iv methods can be problematic if the instrument is weak or if the assumption that the iv does not directly impact @xmath34 ( the exclusion restriction ) is violated , an untestable assumption .",
    "thus , in fitting a model with contemporaneous peer effects , one faces a choice between assuming a multivariate distribution holds , relying on the non - existence of unmeasured confounding variables , or relying on the validity of an iv .",
    "none of these assumptions can be evaluated unconditionally on the observed data .",
    "while joint modeling and iv methods provide theoretical solutions to the estimation of contemporaneous peer effects , the notion of causality is philosophically challenged when the cause is not known to occur prior to effect . therefore , longitudinal data provide an important basis for the identification of causal effects , in particular in negating concerns of reverse causality . if the observation times are far apart the use of lagged alter predictors may , however , substantially reduced the power of an analysis .",
    "if the dyads consist of mutually exclusive or isolated pairs of actors there are no inter - dyad ties and influence only acts within dyads .",
    "an example of such a situation occurs when individuals can have exactly one relationship and the relationship is reciprocated , as is the case with spousal dyads .",
    "the network influence models of section  [ sec : influ ] reduce to _ dyadic influence models _ in which the predictors are based on individual alters . for example , the dyadic influence model analogous to ( [ eq : dynamcf ] ) is obtained by replacing the subscript @xmath90 with @xmath2 .",
    "that is , @xmath91 the model in ( [ eq : dyad1 ] ) may be estimated using generalized estimating equations ( gee ) , avoiding specifying a distribution for @xmath57 . however ,",
    "if any relationships are bidirectional , standard software packages will yield inconsistent estimates of the peer effects as they do not account for the statistical dependence introduced by individuals who play the dual role of ego and alter at time @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "there has recently been a lot of interest and discussion concerning causal peer effects .",
    "issues that have been discussed include the use of ordinary least squares ( ols ) for the estimation of contemporaneous peer effects @xcite and the identification of peer effects independent of homophily @xcite .",
    "the discussion has helped elevate social network methodology to the forefront of many disciplines .",
    "for example , show that ols still provides a valid test of the null hypothesis that the peer effect is zero when the true peer effect is zero .",
    "therefore , ols can be used to test for peer effects despite the fact that ols estimates are inconsistent under the alternative hypothesis .",
    "use tie directionality to account for unmeasured confounding variables under the assumption that their effect on relationship status is the same for all types of relationships .",
    "the rationale is that the estimated peer effect in dyads where the relationship is not expected to be conducive to peer influence ( `` control relationships '' ) provides a baseline against which to identify the peer effect for other types of relationships .",
    "however , this test fails to offer complete protection against unmeasured homophily @xcite , reflecting the vulnerability of observational data to unmeasured sources of bias .",
    "however , sensitivity analyses that evaluate the effect - size needed to overturn the results may be conducted to help support a conclusion by illustrating that the confounding effect must be implausibly large to reverse the finding @xcite .",
    "instrumental variable ( iv ) methods have also been used to estimate peer effects .",
    "a common source of instruments is alters attributes other than the one for which the peer effect is estimated @xcite .",
    "potential ivs must predict the attribute of interest in the alter but must not be a cause of the same attribute in other individuals .",
    "attributes that are invisible such as an individuals genes appear to be ideal candidate genes . for instance , an individual with two risk alleles of an obesity gene is at more risk of increased bmi but conditional on that individual s bmi their obesity genes should not affect the bmi of other individuals .",
    "however , if the obesity genes are revealed through another behavior ( a phenomenon known as _ pleiotropy _ ) that is associated with bmi then , unless such factors are conditioned on , genes will not be valid ivs .",
    "sociocentric network studies assemble data on the ties representing the relationship linking a set of individuals , such as all physicians within a medical practice .",
    "models for such data posit that global network properties are the result of phenomena involving subgroups of ( most commonly ) four or fewer actors @xcite .",
    "examples of such regularities are actor - level tendencies to produce or attract ties ( homophily and heterophily ) , dyadic tendencies toward reciprocity , and triadic tendencies toward closure or transitivity .",
    "a relational model , in essence , specifies a set of micro - level rules governing the local structure of a network . in this section , models for cross - sectional relational data",
    "are consider first followed by longitudinal counterparts of them .",
    "the simplest models for sociocentric data assume dyadic independence . under the random model ,",
    "all ties have equal probability of occurring and the status of one has no impact on the status of another @xcite .",
    "more general dyadic models were developed in and later were extended in . because independence is still assumed between dyads , the information from the data about the model parameters accumulates in the form of a product of the probability densities for the status of the dyadin observation over each dyad : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are vectors of actor - specific parameters representing the actors expansiveness ( propensity to send ties ) and popularity ( propensity to receive ties ) , respectively , and @xmath95 is a vector of covariates relevant to @xmath3 ( this may include covariates specific to either actor and combined traits of both actors ) .",
    "it is important to realize that covariates can be directional ; thus , @xmath95 need not equal @xmath96 .",
    "although the model may include other parameters , @xmath97 and @xmath98 play an important role in network analysis due to their relationship to the degree distribution of the network and so are explicitly denoted .",
    "when relationship status is binary , the distribution of @xmath99 is a four - component multinomial distribution .",
    "the probabilities are typically represented in the form of a generalized logistic regression model ( an extension of the logistic regression model to @xmath100 categories ) having the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are functions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the predictors can be directional and so it is likely that @xmath110 .",
    "however , the only covariates included in @xmath105 must be non - directional as they affect the likelihood of @xmath111 ; the sign of @xmath105 indicates whether a mutual tie is more ( if @xmath112 ) or less ( if @xmath113 ) likely to occur than predicted by the density terms and so is a measure of _ reciprocity _ or _",
    "mutuality_. null mutuality is implied by @xmath114 .    in dyadic models , the terms @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 account for the local network about actors @xmath1 and @xmath2 through the inclusion of @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , other effects can be homogeneous across actors or actor - specific .",
    "for example , the p@xmath115 model @xcite assumes @xmath116 and @xmath117 , implying the covariate - free joint probability density function of the network given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the p@xmath115 model depends on @xmath123 network statistics and associated parameters .",
    "if the p@xmath115 model holds within ( ego , alter)-shared values of categorical attributes , a stochastic block model is obtained by allowing block - specific modifications to the density and reciprocity of ties @xcite .",
    "an extension would allow reciprocity to also vary between blocks .",
    "because the stochastic blockmodel extension of the p@xmath115 model is saturated at the actor - level due to the expansiveness and popularity fixed effects , no assumption is made about differences in the degree - distributions of the actors in different blocks .",
    "stochastic block models are the basis of mixed - membership and other recent statistical approaches for node - partitioning social network data @xcite .",
    "individuals in the same block of a stochastic block model are often referred to as being structurally equivalent .",
    "a criticism of dyadic independence models is that they fail to account for interdependencies between dyads .",
    "the @xmath124 or exponential random graph model ( ergm ) generalizes dyadic independence models @xcite .",
    "an ergm has the form @xmath125 where @xmath9 denotes a possible state of the network , @xmath126 denotes a network statistic evaluated over @xmath9 ( e.g. , the number of ties , the number of reciprocated ties ) , @xmath127 and @xmath128 is the set of all @xmath129 possible realizations of a directed network . in general , the scale factor @xmath130 that sums over each distinct network does not factor into a product of analogous terms . as a result , it is computationally infeasible to exactly evaluate the likelihood function of dyadic dependent ergms for even moderately - sized @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xmath131 is problematic @xcite ) .",
    "the key feature of the p@xmath115 model that allows the probability of the network to decompose into the product of dyadic - state probabilities is that it only depends on network statistics @xmath126 that sum individual ties or pairs of ties from the same dyad .",
    "if dyads are independent unless they share an actor , the network is a _",
    "markov random graph _",
    "markov random graphs may include terms for density , reciprocity , transitivity and other triadic structures , and @xmath26-stars ( equivalent to the degree distribution )  these terms contain sums of the products of no more than three ties .",
    "such terms may be multiplied with actor attribute variables to define interaction effects .",
    "( an interaction is the effect of the product of two or more variables ; e.g. , if males and females have different tendencies to reciprocate ties then gender is said to interact with reciprocity . )",
    "networks that extend markov random graphs by allowing four - cycles but no fifth- or higher - order terms are _ partially conditionally dependent_. in such networks , a sufficient condition for dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath132 is that @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",
    "thus , two edges may be dependent despite not having any actors in common .",
    "partial conditional dependence is the basis of the new parameterizations of network statistics developed by @xcite that have led to better fitting ergms ( see below ) .    under ergms ,",

    "thus , the parameters of an ergm are interpreted as the change in the log of the odds that the tie is present to not being present conditional on the status of the rest of the network @xcite .",
    "a large positive parameter suggests that more configurations of the type represented in the network statistic appear in the observed network more often than expected by chance , all else equal @xcite .    due to the factorization of the likelihood function in ( [ eq : likefn ] ) , likelihood - based estimators of dyadic independence models",
    "have desirable statistical properties such as consistency and statistical efficiency .",
    "however , if the model for the network includes predictors based on three or more actors , no such factorization occurs and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) is required to optimize the likelihood function for ( [ eq : ergm ] ) , which for each observation involves making computations on @xmath138 ( @xmath139 if directed and @xmath140 if non - directed ) distinct networks .",
    "ergms have been demonstrated to be estimable on networks with @xmath141 @xcite , but computational feasibility depends on the terms in the model and the amount of memory available .",

    "other estimation difficulties include failure of the optimization algorithm to converge and the fitted model producing nonsensical `` degenerate '' predicted networks . _",
    "degeneracy _ arises because for certain specifications of @xmath126 the network statistics are highly collinear or there is unaccounted effect heterogeneity across the network . as a result , under the fitted model the local neighborhood of networks around the observed network may have probability close to 0 and those networks with positive probability ( often the empty and complete graphs )",
    "may be radically different from each other and thus the observed network .",
    "although the average network over repeated draws has similar network statistics to the observed network , the individual networks generated under the fitted model do not bear any resemblence to the observed network .    because an actor of degree @xmath142 contributes @xmath26-stars for @xmath143 ,",

    "however , extensions of ergms to longitudinal scenarios have been developed ",
    "most often involving a markov assumption to describe dependence across time .",
    "the first longitudinal ergms treated tie - formation and tie - dissolution as equitable events in the evolution of the network @xcite .",
    "a more general formulation treats tie - formation ( attractiveness in the context of network science ) and tie - duration ( the complement of tie - duration referred to as fitness in network science ) as separable processes , thereby allowing the same network statistic to impact tie - formation and tie - dissolution differently @xcite .",
    "like ergms for cross - sectional data , longitudinal ergms are defined by statistics that count the number of occurrences of substructures in the network . however , in addition to the current state of the network , such statistics may also depend on previous states . under markovian dependence , network statistics only depend on the current and the most recent state ; for example , the number of ties that remain intact from the preceding observation .",
    "the recently released tergm ( `` temporal exponential random graph model '' ) package in the statnet suite in r estimates ergms for discrete temporal ( i.e. , longitudinal ) sociocentric data @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach for modeling network evolution is the actor - oriented model @xcite .",
    "this centers on an objective function that actors seek to maximize and which may be sensitive to multiple network properties , including reciprocity , closure , homophily , or contact with high - degree actors .",
    "the model assumes that actors control their outgoing ties and change them in order to increase their satisfaction with the network in one or more respects as quantified by the objective function .",
    "it resembles a rationale choice model in which each agent attempts to maximize their own utility function .",
    "estimated parameters indicate whether changes in a given property raise or lower actor satisfaction .",
    "an important distinction of actor - oriented models from ergms is that the relevant network statistics in the actor - oriented model are specific to individuals rather than being aggregations across the network .",
    "however , like ergms , estimation is computationally intensive .",
    "the siena package in stocnet @xcite uses a stochastic approximation algorithm but struggles with networks of appreciable size ( e.g. , thousands of individuals ) .",
    "because they only resemble ergms in the limiting steady - state case , actor - oriented models may also suffer from degeneracy but the problem is less profound @xcite .",
    "a virtue of the actor - oriented modeling framework in siena is that an actor s relationships can be modeled jointly with the social - influence effects of an actor s peers on their own traits . if the model is correctly specified , it has the potential to account for unmeasured confounding factors that affect both the evolution of relationship status and the values of individuals attributes , yielding unbiased estimates of the effects of observed variables affecting social influence and the evolution of the network .",
    "such a model was developed by steglich and colleagues @xcite but to date work in this area is limited .      in ergms",
    "a huge increase in computational complexity occurs between the dyadic independent and dyadic dependent models .",
    "a second concern about ergms is that in general they are not consistent under sampling in the sense that statistical inferences drawn from the network for the sample do not generalize to the full network @xcite .",
    "the few ergms to exhibit such consistency include the dyadic independent p@xmath115 and stochastic block models .",
    "an alternative modeling strategy provides a more graduated transition between independence and dependence scenarios by using random effects to model dyadic dependence and also ensures consistency between the results of analyzing the sample and the population of interest .",
    "random effects are used to account for dyadic independence in the p@xmath164 model @xcite introduced below .    the p@xmath164 model is much like the p@xmath115 model except that the expansiveness @xmath165 and popularity @xmath166 parameters are random as opposed to fixed effects .",
    "typically , @xmath167 is assumed to be bivariate normal with covariance matrix @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the p@xmath164 model is given by @xmath169 @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "thus , @xmath172 and @xmath173 includes a subset of covariates that are symmetric ( @xmath174 ) in reflection of the fact that reciprocity is a symmetric phenomenon .",
    "conditional on @xmath167 the model implies that the relationship status of one dyad does not depend on that of another .",
    "a positive off - diagonal element of @xmath168 implies that expansive individuals also tend to be popular .",
    "the p@xmath164 model can be extended to account for more general forms of dyadic dependence than the latent propensity of an individual to send or receive ties .",
    "let each individual have a vector of latent variables , denoted @xmath175 in the case of individual @xmath1 , that together with the same for individual @xmath2 affects the value of the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of tie - status on @xmath176 is generally represented using a simple mathematical function .",
    "the major types of models are latent class models @xcite , latent distance models @xcite , and latent eigenmodels @xcite .",
    "these models are characterized by the form of the latent variable @xmath177 which is included as an additional predictor in @xmath103 . in ( [ eq : latvble ] ) the form and interpretation of @xmath176 changes from denoting a scalar @xmath178 categorical latent variable in the latent class model ( first row ) , to a position in a continuously - valued multi - dimensional space in the latent distance and latent eigenmodels ( second and third rows , respectively ) .",
    "the term @xmath178 can be added to either the @xmath103 or @xmath105 components of the p@xmath164 model to allow higher - order dependence to moderate the effect of density and reciprocity , respectively .    in the latent class specification",
    "the array of values of @xmath179 form a symmetric @xmath180 matrix @xmath181 .",
    "a basic specification is @xmath182 if @xmath183 ( nodes in same partition ) and @xmath184 if @xmath185 ( nodes in different partitions ) ( ) .",
    "latent class models extend stochastic - block models to allow latent clusters as well as observed clustering variables .",
    "this family of models is suited to network data exhibiting structural equivalence ; that is , under the model individuals are hypothesized to belong to latent groups such that members of the same group have similar patterns of relationships .    in the latent distance specification the most common values for @xmath186 are 1 and 2 , corresponding to absolute and cartesian distance , respectively .",
    "the distance metric accounts for latent homophily  the effect of unobserved individual characteristics that induce ties between individuals . in this model",
    ", @xmath176 can be interpreted as the position of individual @xmath1 in a social space @xcite .",
    "this model accounts for triadic dependence ( e.g. , transitivity ) by requiring that latent distances between individuals obey the triangle inequality .",
    "latent distance models are available in the latentnet package in r @xcite .",
    "the latent eigenmodel is the most general specification and accounts for both structural equivalence and latent homophily .",
    "furthermore , the parameter space of the latent eigenmodel model of dimension @xmath187 generalizes that of the latent class model of the same dimension and weakly generalizes the latent distance model of dimension @xmath188 .",
    "conversely , the latent distance model of dimension @xmath187 does not generalize the one - dimensional latent eigenmodel model @xcite . the closeness of the latent factors @xmath189 and @xmath190 quantifies the structural equivalence of actors @xmath1 and @xmath2 positions in the network ; a tie is more likely if @xmath189 and @xmath190 have a similar direction and magnitude , allowing for more clustering than under ( [ eq : p2mod ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "latent homophily is accounted for by the diagonal elements of @xmath191 , which can be positive or negative ( allowing for heterophily as well as homophily ) .",
    "the model constrains the extent to which the quadratic - forms @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and @xmath194 constructed from the latent vectors vary from one another .",
    "the greater the magnitude of @xmath195 the greater the extent to which ties are expected to cluster and form cliques .",
    "the latent eigenmodel model is appropriate if a network exhibits clustering due to both structural equivalence and unmeasured homophily .    in and models",
    "are specified at the tie - level with reciprocity ( in directed networks ) represented as the within - dyad correlation between two tie - specific latent variables . modeling reciprocity as a latent process differs from the p@xmath164 model , in which reciprocity",
    "is represented as a direct effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , an alternative family of latent variable models for networks is obtained by augmenting the density term in the p@xmath164 model with ( [ eq : latvble ] ) .",
    "an advantage of specifying a joint model at the dyad level is that the resulting ( extended - p@xmath164 ) model involves @xmath196 fewer latent variables , possibly alleviating computational issues such as non - identifiability of parameters or multiple local optima .    the challenges of estimating models involving latent variables resemble those of factor analysis or other dimension - reduction methods .",
    "first , an appropriate value of @xmath187 may not be able to be specified from existing knowledge of the network and estimating @xmath187 from the data is not straightforward .",
    "second , computational challenges in estimating the latent variables can make the method difficult to apply to large networks .",
    "however , such issues are more easily overcome than degeneracy in ergms .",
    "degeneracy is avoided in these models as the model for a dyad determines the distribution of the network . in other words ,",
    "the factorization of the likelihood into a product of like terms ensures asymptotically that networks sampled under the model are almost surely in the neighborhood of the observed network , increasingly so as @xmath16 increases .",
    "another contrast with ergms is that the model describes a population as opposed to the single observed network .",
    "thus , in latent variable models the data generating process is modeled whereas ergms are specific to the observed network and so have more in common with finite population inference .",
    "another advantage of conditional independence models over ergms is that the same types of models can be applied to valued relational data .",
    "analogous to generalized linear models , the link function and any parametric distributions assumptions that define a conditional independence network model can be tailored to the type of relationship variable ( scale , count , ratio , categorical , multivariate ) . however",
    ", a recent adaptation of ergms has been proposed for modeling count - valued sociocentric data @xcite .",
    "offsetting the above advantageous features of conditional independence models is that terms such as @xmath178 are limited from the hypothesis testing and interpretational standpoint in that they do not distinguish particular forms of social equivalence or latent homophily .",
    "for example , the effect of transitivity is not distinguished from that of cyclicity or higher - order clustering , such as tetradic closure .",
    "therefore , the choice of model in practice might depend on the importance of testing specific hypotheses about higher - order effects to obtaining a model whose generative basis allows it to make predictions beyond the data set on which the model was estimated .",
    "longitudinal counterparts of conditional independence models are obtained by introducing terms that account for longitudinal dependence ( e.g. , past states of the dyad ) .",
    "a simple markov transition model was developed in with tie - formation and tie - dissolution treated as unrelated processes .",
    "conditional on the past state of the dyad and the sender and receiver random effects , the value of each tie is assumed to be statistically independent of that of any other tie .",
    "a more general formulation extends the p@xmath164 model , allowing dependence between ties within a dyad ( reciprocity ) , heterogeneous effects in the formation and dissolution of ties , and the inclusion of higher - order effects ( e.g. , third - order interactions to account for transitivity ) as lagged predictors @xcite .",
    "the approach in is notable for attempting to capture the best of both worlds : it allows localized ( actor or dyadic ) versions of the higher - order predictors available in ergms to be included as predictors , but avoids degeneracy by using their lagged values as opposed to their current values as predictors .",
    "therefore , conditional on the observed and latent predictors , dyads are cross - sectionally independent but longitudinally dependent on prior states of other dyads ( in addition to their own past states ) in the network .",
    "an extension that builds on is to incorporate the latent class , distance or eigenfactor terms in ( [ eq : latvble ] ) in the model .",
    "such a model was entertained in but has not yet been developed .",
    "we now switch attention to methods that have been derived and used in the field of network science . in general ,",
    "network science approaches avoid assumptions about distributions in models .",
    "for example , to test whether a network exhibits a certain property , the commonly - employed approach is to use a permutation test to develop a null distribution for a statistic that embodies the property in question and then evaluate how extreme the observed value of the statistic is with respect to the null distribution .",
    "this technique is the cornerstone of the procedure used to evaluate the degree of separation to which social clustering can be detected in .",
    "network science focuses not only on social networks , but also covers information networks , transportation networks , biological networks , and many others .",
    "most of the networks studied within network science are non - directed as ties are typically thought of as connections as opposed to measures for which the distinction between instigator and receiver is relevant .",
    "thus , the networks in this section are assumed to be non - directed unless stated otherwise .",
    "network science has taken a somewhat different approach to modeling networks than the social sciences or statistics .",
    "essentially all models developed within network science are _ generative models _ , sometimes also known as forward models , in contrast to probabilistic models such as ergms .",
    "these models start from a set of simple hypothesized mechanisms , often functioning at the level of individual nodes and ties , and attempt to describe what types of network structures emerge from a repeated application of the proposed mechanisms .",
    "many of the models describe growing networks , where one starts from a small connected seed network consisting of a few connected nodes , and then grows the network by subsequent addition of nodes , usually one at a time .",
    "the _ attachment rules _ specify how exactly an incoming node attaches itself to the existing network .",
    "generative models are commonly exploratory in nature .",
    "if they reproduce the type of structure observed in an empirical network , it is plausible that the proposed mechanisms may underlie network formation in the real world .",
    "the main insight to be gained from a generative model is a potential explanation for why a network possesses the type of structure it does .",
    "many of the models are simple in nature , which occasionally leads to analytical tractability , but the main reason for simplicity is the potential to expose clearly the main mechanism(s ) driving the phenomenon of interest .",
    "it is not uncommon for generative models to possess only two or three parameters , yet occasionally simple generative mechanisms can explain some of the key features surprisingly well .",
    "once a model can explain the main features , it can be fine - tuned by adding more specific or nuanced mechanisms .",
    "a few examples of generative models are now described .",
    "cumulative advantage refers to phenomena where success seems to breed success , such as in the case of accumulation of further wealth to already wealthy individuals . in networks of scientific citations ,",
    "where a node represents a scientific paper , each node has some number of edges pointing to nodes that correspond to cited papers @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "for example , there would be an edge pointing from the node representing this chapter to the node representing the 1965 _ science _ paper of price . while the out - degree of nodes is fairly uniform , as the length of bibliographies is fairly constrained , the in - degree distribution was found to be fat - tailed with the functional form of a power - law , @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "price later proposed a mathematical model for cumulative advantage processes , `` the situation in which success breeds success '' @xcite .",
    "in this model , nodes are added to the network one at a time , and the average out - degree of each node is fixed .",
    "the attachment rule in the model specifies that each new paper will cite existing papers with probability proportional to the number of citations they already have .",
    "thus each incoming node will attach itself with some number of directed edges to the existing network , the exact number of ties being drawn from a distribution , and the nodes these new edges are pointing to will be chosen proportional to their in - degree . in this formulation , however , papers with exactly zero citations can never accrue citations . to overcome this problem , one can either consider the original publication as the first citation so that each paper starts with one citation or , alternatively , add a small constant to the number of citations @xcite . either way , the outcome is that the target nodes are chosen in proportion to their in - degree plus this small positive constant",
    ". a derivation of the resulting in - degree distribution is given by newman @xcite . denoting the average out - degree of a node by @xmath186 and using @xmath198 to denote the small positive constant , the in - degree distribution @xmath199 for large values of @xmath26 has the power - law form @xmath197 , where @xmath200 .",
    "this simple model ( although the derivation of the result is quite involved ) is able to reproduce the empirical citation ( in - degree ) distribution for scientific papers with surprising accuracy given that the model only contains two parameters .",
    "it may seem odd that the model does not incorporate any notion of paper quality , which surely should be an important driver of citations .",
    "here it is important to notice that the model does not make any attempt to predict _ which _ paper becomes popular ( although it can be shown , using the model , that papers published at the inception of a field have a much higher probability to become popular ) .",
    "instead , the model incorporates the quality of papers implicitly , and indeed the number of citations to a paper is frequently seen as an indicator of its quality .",
    "popular papers are also easily discovered , which further feeds their popularity .",
    "the idea of using popularity as a proxy for quality may extend to other areas where resources are scarce ; for example , skilled surgeons are in high demand .",
    "the cumulative advantage model of price @xcite is developed as a modification of the polya urn model , which is used to model a sampling process where each draw from the urn , corresponding to a collection of different types of objects , changes the composition of the urn and thereby changes the probability of drawing an object of any type in the future .",
    "the standard polya urn model consists of an urn containing some number of black and white balls , drawing a ball at random and then returning it to the urn along with a new ball of the same color @xcite .",
    "independently of price , barabasi and albert introduced a similar model in 1999 @xcite .",
    "they examined the degree distributions of an actor collaboration network ( two actors are connected if they are cast in the same movie ) , world wide web ( two web pages are connected if there is a hyperlink from one page to the other ) , and power grid ( two elements ( generators , transformers , substations ) are connected if there is a high - voltage transmission line between them ) , finding that they approximately followed power - law distributions . although the actor collaboration network and the power grid networks are defined much like a projection from a two - mode to a one mode network , a subtle difference between them is that direct interaction between the nodes can be assumed . in other words ,",
    "the nodes can be thought of as directly linked .    both of the generic network models in existence at the time , the erds - rnyi and the watts - strogatz models , operated on a fixed set of @xmath16 vertices , and assumed that connections were placed or rewired without any regard to the degrees of the nodes to which they were connected .",
    "the model of barabasi and albert changed both of these aspects .",
    "first , they introduced the notion of network growth , such that at each time step a new node would be added to the network .",
    "second , this new node would connect to the existing network with exactly @xmath142 non - directed edges , and the nodes they attached to were chosen in proportion to their degree .",
    "the probability for the incoming vertex to connect to vertex @xmath1 depends solely on its degree @xmath201 and is given by @xmath202    the model was solved by barabasi and albert using rate equations , which are differential equations for the evolution of node degree over time where both degree and time , as an approximation , are treated as if they were continuous variables @xcite .",
    "more general solutions were provided by krapivsky _",
    "et al . _ also using rate equations @xcite and dorogovtsev _",
    "_ using master equations which , like rate equations , are differential equations for the evolution of node degree , but they ( correctly ) treat degree as a discrete variable while still making the continuous - time approximation for time @xcite . in the master equation approach ,",
    "one writes down an equation for the evolution of the number of nodes of a given degree .",
    "let us use @xmath203 to denote the number of nodes of degree @xmath26 in the network at time @xmath77 , where time is identified with network size , i.e. , time @xmath77 corresponds to the network at the point of its evolution when it consists of @xmath77 nodes .",
    "( the nodes making up the seed network can be usually ignored in the limit as time increases . )",
    "the number @xmath203 can change in two ways : it can either increase as an incoming node attaches itself to a node of degree @xmath27 and thus turns it into a node of degree @xmath26 , or it can decrease as an incoming node attaches itself to a node of degree @xmath26 , turning into a node of degree @xmath204 .",
    "the former situation leads to @xmath205 , and the latter to @xmath206 .",
    "transitions larger than one , e.g. , from @xmath26 to @xmath207 or from @xmath26 to @xmath208 are very unlikely and can be ignored .",
    "the value of @xmath209 increases by one per time step as each incoming node has degree @xmath142 , which also means there are no nodes with degree less than @xmath142 , and hence the equations used to model the evolution of quantities like @xmath203 are not valid for @xmath210 .",
    "the resulting degee distribution has the form @xmath211 which asymptotically behaves as @xmath212 .",
    "the preferential attachment model of barabasi and albert has attracted a tremendous amount of scientific interest in the past few years , and consequently numerous modifications of the model have been introduced .",
    "for example , extensions of the model allow :    * ties to appear and disappear between any pairs of vertices ( the original formulation only considers the addition of ties between the incoming vertex and set of vertices already in existence ) .",
    "* vertices to be deleted either uniformly at random or based on their connectivity . *",
    "the attachment probability @xmath213 to be super - linear or sub - linear in degree , or to consist of several terms .",
    "* nodal attributes , such as the _ attractiveness _ ( the propensity with which new ties form with the node ) or _ fitness _ ( the propensity with which established ties remain intact ) of a node , and the attachment probability can incorporate these attributes in addition to degree . * edges to assume weights instead of @xmath214 binary values to codify connection strength between any pair of elements .    in the context of physician networks ,",
    "a preferential attachment model could be used to examine the process of new physicians seeking colleagues to ask for advice upon joining a medical organization , such as a hospital . under the preferential attachment hypothesis",
    ", new physicians would be more likely to form ties with and thus seek advice from popular established physicians or physicians in the same cohort ( e.g. , medical school or residency program ) .      the class of models known as _ network evolution models _ can be defined via three properties : ( i ) the models incorporate a set of stochastic attachment rules which determine the evolution of the network structure explicitly on a time - step  by  time - step basis ; ( ii ) the network evolution starts from an empty network consisting of nodes only , or from a small seed network possessing arbitrary structure ; and ( iii ) the models incorporate a stopping criterion , which for growing network models is typically in the form of the network size reaching a predetermined value , and for dynamical ( non - growing ) network models the convergence of network statistics to their asymptotic values .",
    "many network evolution models do not reference intrinsic properties or attributes of nodes , and in this sense they are similar to the various implementations of preferential attachment models that do not postulate node specific fitness or attractiveness .",
    "most network evolution models that are intended to model social networks employ some variants of focal closure and cyclic closure ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "_ focal closure _ refers to the formation of ties between individuals based on shared foci , which in a medical context could correspond to a group of doctors who practice in a particular hospital ( the focus ) .",
    "the concept of shared foci in network science is analogous to homophily in social network analysis .",
    "more broadly , ties could represent any interest or activity that connects otherwise unlinked individuals .",
    "in contrast , _ cyclic closure _ refers to the idea of forming new ties by navigating and leveraging one s existing social ties , a process that results in a cycle in the underlying network .",
    "because the network is non - directed , the term cycle is used interchangeably with closure .",
    "this differs from when the network is directional and a cycle is a specific form of closure , with transitivity being another form .",
    "_ triadic closure _ , which is the special case of cyclic closure involving just three individuals , refers to the process of getting to know friends of friends , leading to the formation of a closed triad in the non - directed network .",
    "most social networks are expected to ( i ) have skewed and fat - tailed degree distributions , ( ii ) be assortatively mixed ( high - degree individuals are connected to high - degree individuals ) , ( iii ) be highly clustered , and ( iv ) possess the small - world property ( average shortest path lengths are short , or more precisely , scale as @xmath215 ) , and ( v ) exhibit community structure .    the models by davidsen _",

    "only when the value of @xmath217 is decreased below a point denoted by @xmath221 does the network `` collapse '' and re - enter the sparse phase .",
    "this phenomenon , which demonstrates some of the connections between network science and statistical physics , is typical of first - order or discontinuous phase transitions in statistical physics , and it demonstrates how hysteresis , the effect of the system remembering its past state can rise in networked systems . although markov dependence is a special case of hysteresis , its use is generally restricted to probabilistic models whereas hysteresis is typically aligned with nonlinear models of physical phenomena having a continuous state - space . from the social network point of view",
    "this means that the network can remain in a connected phase even if the rate of establishing new connections at the current rate would not be sufficient for getting the network to that phase in the first place . in more practical terms",
    ", this finding implies that it is possible to maintain a highly connected network with a relatively low `` effort '' ( the @xmath217 parameter in the model ) once the network has been established , but that same low level of effort would not be sufficient for establishing the dense phase of network evolution in the first place .",

    "in addition , if there is a link connecting node @xmath1 and node @xmath26 , the weight @xmath231 on that link is similarly increased by @xmath230 ; otherwise a new link is established between node @xmath1 and @xmath26 with @xmath232 . when @xmath233 , there is no clear community structure present , but as the value of @xmath230 is increased , very clear nucleation of communities takes place .",
    "this phenomenon happens because when @xmath234 , a type of positive feedback or memory gets imprinted on the network , which reinforces existing connections , and makes future traversal of those connections more likely .",
    "this is not unlike the models of cumulative advantage or preferential attachment discussed above , but now applies to individual links as opposed to nodes .",
    "if one inspects the community structure produced by the model , most of the strong links appear to be located within communities , whereas links between communities are typically weak .",

    "nodal attribute models , in stark contrast to network evolution models , specify nodal attributes for each node , which could be scalar or vector valued .",
    "the probability of linkage between any two nodes is typically an increasing function of the similarity of the nodal attributes of the two nodes in consideration .",
    "this is compatible with the notion of homophily , the tendency for like to attract like .",
    "nodal attribute models can also be interpreted as spatial models , where the idea is that each node has a specific location in a social space .",
    "the models by bogu _",
    "_ @xcite and wong _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite serve as interesting examples .",
    "nodal attribute models do not specify attachment rules at the level of the network , and in some sense can be seen as latent variable models for social network formation .",
    "these types of models have been studied less in the network science literature than network evolution models .",
    "clearly , nodal attribute models have a strong resemblance to models developed and studied in the social network literature that treat dyads as independent conditional on observed attributes of the individuals , other covariates , and various latent variables ( individual - specific random effects in the case of the p@xmath164 model , categorical latent variables in the case of latent class models , continuous latent variables under the latent - space and latent eigenmodels in section  [ sec : condindep ] ) .",
    "unlike network science , work on such models in the social network literature has been more prominent than work on network evolution .",
    "a difference in the approach of some nodal attribute models and social network models is that the former may use specific rules for determining whether a tie is expected , such as a threshold function ( in a sense emulating formal decision making ) , whereas the latter rewards values of parameters that make the model most consistent with the observed network(s ) .",
    "many network characteristics are either microscopic or macroscopic in nature ; the value of a microscopic characteristic depends on local network structure only , whereas the value of a macroscopic characteristic depends on the structure of the entire network .",
    "node degree is an example of a microscopic quantity : the degree of a node depends only on the number of its connections .",
    "in contrast , network diameter , the longest of all pairwise shortest paths in the network , can change dramatically by the addition ( or removal ) of even a very small number of links anywhere in the network .",
    "for example , a @xmath26-cycle consists of @xmath26 nodes connected by @xmath26 links such that a cycle is formed with each node connected to precisely two nodes .",
    "the diameter of such a network is @xmath238 , where the floor function @xmath239 maps a real number @xmath240 to the largest previous integer , such that for an even @xmath241 it follows that @xmath242 . for large values of @xmath26 , adding just a few links quickly brings down the value of network diameter .",
    "there is a third , intermediate scale that lies between the microscopic and macroscopic scales which is often known as the _ mesoscopic _ scale .",
    "for example , a @xmath26-clique could justifiably be called a mesoscopic object ( especially if @xmath26 is large ) .",
    "another type of mesoscopic structure is that of a network community , which can be loosely defined as a set of nodes that are densely connected to each other but sparsely connected to other nodes in the network ( but not to the extent of resulting in distinct components ) .",
    "there has been considerable interest especially in the physics literature focusing on how to define and detect such communities , and several review papers cover the existing methods @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind many of these efforts is the idea that communities may correspond to functional units in networks , such as unobserved societal structures .",
    "the examples range from metabolic circuits within cells @xcite to tightly - knit groups of individuals in social networks @xcite .",
    "the interested reader can consult the review articles on community detection methods @xcite for more details .",
    "another application is health care where , for instance , have deduced communities of physicians based on network ties representing their treating the same patients within the same period of time .",
    "the clustering of physicians in communities is shown for one particular hospital referral region ( a health care market encompassing at least one major city where both cardiovascular surgical procedures and neurosurgery are performed ) in the united states ( figure  [ fig : commex ] ) .",
    "one potential application of network science methods for community detection is in the area of health education and disease prevention ( e.g. , screening ) . due to limited resources",
    ", it may not be possible to send materials or otherwise directly educate every member of the population .",
    "the partition of individuals into groups would facilitate a possibly more efficient approach whereby the communities are first studied to identify key individuals .",
    "then a few key individuals in each community are trained and advised on mechanisms for helping the intervention to diffuse across the community . a general characteristic of interventions where such an approach might be useful are those where intensive training is required to be effective and where delegation of resources through passing on knowledge or advice is possible .",
    "a number of network community detection methods define communities implicitly via an appropriately chosen quality function .",
    "the underlying idea is that a given network can be divided into a large number of partitions , or subsets of nodes , such that each node belongs to one subset , and each such partition @xmath243 has a scalar - valued quality measure associated with it , denoted by @xmath244 . in principle",
    "one would like to enumerate all possible partitions and compute the value of @xmath245 for each of them , and the network communities would then be identified as the partition ( or possibly partitions ) with the highest quality . in practice , however , the number of possible partitions is exceedingly large even for relatively small networks , and therefore heuristics are needed to optimize the value of @xmath245 .",
    "community detection methods based on quality function optimization therefore have two distinct components , which are the functional form of the quality function @xmath245 , and the heuristic used for navigating a subset of partitions over which @xmath245 is maximized .",
    "the most commonly used optimization based approach to community detection is modularity maximization , where modularity is one possible choice for the quality function @xmath245 ; in statistical terminology , modularity maximization would be regarded as a non - parametric procedure due to the fact that no distributional nor functional form assumptions are relied upon .",
    "there are many variants of modularity , but here the focus is on the original formulation by newman and girvan @xcite .",
    "modularity can be seen as a measure that characterizes the extent of homophily or assortative mixing by class membership , and one way to derive it is by considering the observed and expected numbers of connections between vertices of given classes , where the class of vertex @xmath1 is given by @xmath246 .",
    "the following derivation follows closely that of @xcite , although other derivations , based for example on dynamic processes , are also available .",
    "we start by considering the observed number of edges between vertices of the same class , which is given by @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the kronecker delta , and the factor @xmath249 prevents double - counting vertex pairs . to obtain the expected number of edges between vertices of the same class , cut every edge in half , resulting in two stubs per edge , and then connect these stubs at random . for a network with @xmath142 edges , there are a total of @xmath250 such stubs .",
    "consider one of the @xmath201 stubs connected to vertex @xmath1 .",
    "this particular stub will be connected at random to vertex @xmath2 of degree @xmath251 with probability @xmath252 , and since vertex @xmath1 has @xmath201 such stubs , the number of expected edges between vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 is @xmath253 .",
    "the expected number of edges falling between vertices of the same class is now @xmath254 .",
    "the difference between the observed and expected number of within class ties is therefore @xmath255 .",
    "given that the number of edges varies from one network to the next , it is convenient to deal with the fraction of edges as opposed to the number of edges , which is easily obtained by dividing the expression by @xmath142 , resulting in @xmath256 the assignment @xmath243 of nodes into classes that maximizes modularity @xmath257 is taken as the optimal partition and identifies the assignment of nodes into network communities .",
    "note that modularity can be easily generalized from binary networks to weighted networks , in which case @xmath201 stands for the strength ( sum of all adjacent edge weights ) of node @xmath1 , and @xmath142 is the total weight of the edges in the network .",
    "the expression for modularity has an interesting connection to spin models in statistical physics . in a so - called infinite range @xmath258-state potts model ,",
    "each of the @xmath16 particles can be in one of @xmath258 states called spins , and the interaction energy between particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 is @xmath259 if they are in the same state and zero if they are not in different states .",
    "the energy function of the system , known as its hamiltonian , is given by the sum over all of the pairwise interaction energies in the system @xmath260 where @xmath261 indicates the spin of particle @xmath147 and @xmath262 denotes the configuration of all @xmath16 spins . finding the minimum energy state ( the ground state ) of the system corresponds to finding @xmath262 such that @xmath263 is minimized .",
    "the states of the particles ( spins ) correspond to community assignments of nodes in the network problem , and minimizing @xmath263 is mathematically identical to maximizing modularity @xmath257 . in the physical system ,",
    "depending on the interaction energies , the spins seek to align with other spins ( interact ferromagnetically ) or they seek to have different orientations ( interact antiferromagnetically ) . in the community detection problem ,",
    "two nodes seek to be in the same community if they are connected by an edge that is stronger than expected ; otherwise they seek to be in different communities .",
    "this correspondence between the two problems has enabled the application of computational techniques developed for the study of spin systems and other physical systems to be applied to modularity optimization and , more broadly , to the optimization of other quality functions .",
    "simulated annealing , greedy algorithms , and spectral methods serve as examples of these methods .",
    "more details and references are available in community detection review articles @xcite .    , where subscripts @xmath1 and @xmath2 are used to index the nodes and subscript @xmath264 is used to index the slices .",
    "each node is coupled to itself in the other slices , and the structure of this coupling , encoded by the @xmath265 tensor , depends on whether the slices correspond to snapshots taken at different times ( time - dependent network ) , to communities detected at different resolution levels ( multiscale network ) , or to a network consisting of multiple types of interactions ( multiplex network ) . for time - dependent and multiscale networks ,",
    "the slice - to - slice coupling extends for each node a tie to itself across neighboring slices only as exemplified for the node in the upper right corner of the slices ; for multiplex networks , the slice - to - slice coupling extends a tie from each node to itself in all the slices as exemplified for the node in the lower left corner .",
    "whatever the form of this coupling , it is applied the same way to each node , although for visual clarity the slice - to - slice couplings are shown just for two nodes .",

    "_ developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allow the study of community structure of arbitrary multislice networks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] ) , which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one slice to the same node in other slices .",
    "this framework allows studies of community structure in time - dependent , multiscale , and multiplex networks .",
    "much of the work in the area of community detection is motivated by the observation that the behavior of dynamical processes on networks is driven or constrained by their community structure .",
    "the approach of mucha _ et al . _",
    "is based on a reversal of this logic , and it introduces a dynamical process on the network , and the behavior of the dynamical process is used to identify the ( structural ) communities .",
    "the outcome is a quality function @xmath266 \\delta(c_{is } , c_{jr}),\\ ] ] where @xmath267 encodes the node - to - node couplings within slices and @xmath265 encodes the node - to - node couplings across slices that are usually set to a uniform value @xmath268 ; @xmath269 is the number ( or weight ) of ties within slice @xmath264 and @xmath270 is the weight of all ties in the network , both those located within slices and those placed across slices ; @xmath271 is a resolution parameter that controls the scale of community slices separately for each slice @xmath264 .",
    "the standard modularity quality function uses @xmath246 to denote the community assignment of node @xmath1 , but in the multislice context two indices are needed , giving rise to the @xmath272 terms , where the subscript @xmath1 is used to index the node in question and the subscript @xmath264 to index the slice .",
    "the outcome of minimizing @xmath273 , which can be done with the same heuristics as minimization of the standard modularity @xmath274 , is a matrix @xmath275 that consists of the community assignments @xmath272 of each node in every slice .",
    "the multislice framework can handle any combination of time - dependent , multiscale , and multiplex networks .",
    "for example , the slices in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] could correspond , say , to a longitudinal friendship network of a cohort of college students , each slice capturing the offline friendships of the students in each year .",
    "if data on the online friendships of the students were also available , corresponding to a different type of friendship , one could then introduce a second stack of four slices encoding those friendships .",
    "the four offline slices and the four online slices form a multiplex system , and they would be coupled accordingly .",
    "one could further introduce multiple resolution scales , and if one was interested in examining the community structure of the students at three different scales using , say , @xmath276 , this would result in a three - fold replication of the @xmath277 slice array with each of the three layers having a distinct value for @xmath271 .",
    "taken together , this would lead to a three - dimensional @xmath278 array of slices .",
    "cliques are ( usually small ) fully connected subgraphs , and a non - directed @xmath26-clique is a complete subgraph consisting of @xmath26 nodes connected with @xmath279 links . in materials",
    "science the term percolation refers to the movement of fluid through porous materials .",
    "however , in mathematics and statistical physics , the field of percolation theory considers the properties of clusters on regular lattices or random networks , where each edge may be either open or closed , and the clusters correspond to groups of adjacent nodes that are connected by open edges .",
    "the system is said to percolate in the limit of infinite system size if the largest component , held together by open edges , occupies a finite fraction of the nodes .",
    "the method of @xmath26-clique percolation in combines cliques and percolation theory , and it relies on the empirical observation that network communities seem to consist of several small cliques that share many of their nodes with other cliques in the same community . in this framework , cliques can be thought of as the building blocks of communities .",
    "a @xmath26-clique community is then defined as the union of all adjacent @xmath26-cliques , where two @xmath26-cliques are defined to be adjacent if they share @xmath27 nodes .",
    "one can also think about `` rolling '' a @xmath26-clique template from any @xmath26-clique in the graph to any adjacent @xmath26-clique by relocating one of its nodes and keeping the other @xmath27 nodes fixed . a community , defined through the percolation of such a template , then consists of the union of all subgraphs that can be fully explored by rolling a @xmath26-clique template . as @xmath26 becomes larger , the notion of a community becomes more stringent , and values of @xmath280 tend to be most appropriate because larger values become unwieldy .",
    "the special case of @xmath281 reduces to bond ( link ) percolation and @xmath282 reduces to site ( node ) percolation .",
    "the @xmath26-clique percolation algorithm is an example of a local community - finding method .",
    "one obtains a network s global community structure by considering the ensemble of communities obtained by looping over all of its @xmath26-cliques .",
    "some nodes might not belong to any community ( because they are never part of any @xmath26-clique ) , and others can belong to several communities ( if they are located at the interface between two or more communities ) .",
    "the nested nature of communities is recovered by considering different values of @xmath26 , although @xmath26-clique percolation can be too rigid because focusing on cliques typically causes one to overlook other dense modules that are not quite as tightly connected .",
    "the advantage of @xmath26-clique percolation is that it provides a successful way to consider community overlap . allowing the detection of network communities that overlap is especially appealing in the social sciences , as people may belong simultaneously to several communities ( colleagues , family , friends , etc . ) .",
    "however , the case can be made that it is the underlying interactions that are different , and one should not combine interactions that are of fundamentally different types . in statistics , this is analogous to using composite variables or scales that combine multiple items in ( e.g. ) health surveys or questionnaires .",
    "if the nature of the interactions is known , the system might be more appropriately described as a multiplex network , where one tie type encodes professional interactions , another tie type corresponds to personal friendships , and a third tie type captures family memberships . the multislice framework discussed above is able to accommodate memberships in multiple communities as long as distinct interaction types are encoded with distinct ( multiplex ) ties .      the latent class models in section  [ sec : condindep ] partitions the actors in a network into disjoint groups that can be thought of as communities . the clustering process can be thought of as a search for structural equivalence in that individuals are likely to be included in the same community if the network around them is similar to that of their neighbors .",
    "the criteria for judging the efficacy of the partition of nodes into communities is embedded in the statistical model implied for the network and as such is a balance between all of the terms in the model .",
    "this contrasts a non - model - based objective function such as modularity which focuses on maximizing in some sense the ratio of density of ties within and between communities . to illustrate the difference ,",
    "consider a @xmath26-star .",
    "the greater the value of @xmath26 , the greater the discrepancy in the degree of the actors . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath26-stars occur frequently , the members of the same @xmath26-star are likely to be included in the same group by the latent class model but , due to the difference in degree , are unlikely to be grouped under modularity maximization . however , an advantage of the network science approach is that results are likely to be more robust to model mis - specifications than under the social network approach .    in the future it is possible to imagine a bridging of the two approaches to community detection .",
    "for example , a model for the network or the component of the model involving the key determinants of network ties , could be incorporated in the modularity function in ( [ eq : modmax ] ) .",
    "depending on the specification , the result might be a weighted version of modularity in which a higher penalty is incurred if individuals with similar traits  or in structurally equivalent positions with respect to @xmath26-stars , triadic closure or other local network configurations  are included in different communities than if individuals with different traits are in different communities",

    "a novel feature of this chapter is the attention given to network science .",
    "although network science is descriptively - inclined and thus is removed from mainstream translational medical research seeking to identify causes of medical outcomes , the increasing availability of complex systems data provides an opportunity for network science to play a more prominent role in medical research in the future .",

    ", they created a phenotypic disease network ( pdn ) as a map summarizing phenotypic connections between diseases @xcite .",
    "these networks provided important insights into the potential common origins of different diseases , whether diseases progress through cellular functions ( phenotypes ) associated with a single diseased ( mutated ) gene or with other phenotypes , and whether patients affected by diseases that are connected to many other diseases tend to die sooner than those affected by less connected diseases .",
    "such work has the potential to provide insights into many previously untested hypotheses about disease mechanisms .",
    "for example , they may ultimately be helpful in designing `` personalized treatments '' based on the network position held by an individual s combined genetic , proteomic , and phenotypic information .",
    "in addition , they may suggest conditions for which treatments found to be effective on another condition might also be tried .",
    "there are several important topics that have not been discussed , notably including network sampling . in gathering network data , adaptive methods such as link - tracing designs",
    "are often used to identify individuals more likely to know each other and thus to have formed a relationship with other sampled individuals than in a random - probability design .",
    "link - tracing and other related designs are often used to identify hard - to - reach populations @xcite .",
    "however , the sampling probabilities corresponding to link - tracing designs may be difficult to evaluate ( generally requiring the use of simulation ) and it may not be obvious how they should be incorporated in the analysis .",
    "the development of statistical methods that account for the sample design in the analysis of social network data has lagged behind the designs themselves .",
    "however , recently progress has been made on statistical inference for sampled relational network data .    in the future it is likely that more bridges will form between the social network and the network science fields with models or methods developed in one field used to solve problems in the other .",
