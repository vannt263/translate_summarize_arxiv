    "about 37% ( 62/166 ) sources were not previously identified as drg , ero , or @xmath59 galaxies .",
    "what are the selection biases impacting our sample ?",
    "general biases in the selection of massive galaxies in the gns survey have been discussed in conselice et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and we only discuss below the points relevant for our sample .    the 60 gns pointings were selected to include massive galaxies identified via three color methods ( drg , @xmath59 , and iero ) .",
    "combining all three color criteria , rather than using any single one , is already a step forward compared to many earlier studies because no single criterion would isolate a complete sample of massive galaxies ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2006 ; conselice et al .",
    "these three criteria all pick massive galaxies with red observed colors , but due to the range of criteria involved , they can pick both red dusty systems and red evolved stellar populations .",
    "another key step that makes our study less biased towards a specific type of massive galaxy is that our working sample at @xmath0 is neither limited to nor defined by the original color - selected massive galaxies .",
    "rather , it is derived from all galaxies within the survey area that are bright enough to be mapped with nic3/f160w and for which a reliable stellar mass and photometric redshift could be determined by conselice et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , as outlined in @xmath39[datamassz ] .",
    "the first potential bias in this final sample is introduced by excluding galaxies that are undetected by nic3/f160w .",
    "the second potential bias is introduced by excluding detected galaxies for which no reliable stellar mass and photometric redshift could be determined .",
    "for instance , ultra - dusty galaxies , may not be detected in enough of the optical bands to allow a photometric redshift to be reliably estimated .",
    "we assess the impact of the second bias by estimating how many massive galaxies we might miss due to the lack of available photometric redshift and stellar masses . of the 8300 sources detected by gns ,",
    "1076 have no photometric redshift and stellar mass measurements .",
    "most ( 68% ) of these 1076 sources are fainter ( @xmath108 ) than our sample of massive galaxies ( figure  [ maghist ] ) . among gns objects as bright ( @xmath109 ) as our sample of massive galaxies , only 8.5% , or 349/4083 have no redshift or stellar mass measurements .",
    "furthermore , not all 8.5% of these bright ( @xmath109 ) sources will be massive , so that this fraction represents an upper limit on the sources we might not include in our sample due to the lack of a photometric redshift or stellar mass measurements .",
    "we next discuss the impact of the first potential bias and the type of objects the gns survey might not detect .",
    "it is relevant to ask whether we might miss galaxies with blue observed colors .",
    "we believe this is not the case for the following reasons . as discussed above ,",
    "our working sample is not strongly biased against galaxies with blue observed colors because it is not limited to those massive galaxies selected by the three color methods ( drg , @xmath59 , and iero ) that preferentially pick galaxies with red observed colors .",
    "secondly , conselice et al . (",
    "2011 ) explicitly show that many galaxies with blue observed ( @xmath110 ) colors , which would have been undetected by these color selections , do get included in this final sample of massive galaxies for the gns survey . nearly all known lyman break galaxies or bx / bm objects ( reddy et al .",
    "2008 ) at @xmath3 in the gns fields are detected by the gns nic3/f160w imaging ( conselice et al . 2011 ) .    in terms of rest - frame colors , rather than observed colors , it is also important to note that the galaxies detected by gns at @xmath25 or @xmath3 include systems with both blue and red rest - frame @xmath111 colors .",

    "@xmath23 @xmath2 ( figure [ massuv ] ) . the systems with blue rest - frame @xmath111 colors are preferentially at low masses , while gns galaxies with @xmath82 @xmath2 at @xmath3 have preferentially red rest - frame @xmath111 colors , in the range of 1.0 to 1.7 . these inherently red rest - frame @xmath111 colors of the massive galaxies at @xmath3 could be due to a combination of old stellar populations and dusty young star - forming regions .",
    "we checked that the colors are consistent with stellar population synthesis models ( based on bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and assuming a chabrier imf , an exponentially declining star formation history with a 100 myr e - folding time ) .",
    "we find that even without dust extinction @xmath111 color rises rapidly .",

    "ideally , one would like to fit multiple components ( bulge , disk , bar , nuclear point source , etc . ) in the decomposition , but the @xmath56 diameter ( or full width half - maximum ) of the psf ( corresponding to @xmath118 kpc at @xmath0 ) prevents such detailed decompositions . ] .",

    "we find a range in psf fwhm of @xmath123 .",
    "it is clear that a single srsic profile is not a complete indicator of overall galaxy structure .",
    "for instance , in detailed images of nearby galaxies , the best - fit index @xmath18 for a single srsic profile does not always correlate with the bulge srsic index obtained with 2d bulge - disk or bulge - disk - bar decomposition ( weinzirl et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , the single srsic index @xmath18 is on average a good way to separate disk - dominated galaxies from the class of luminous spheroidal and bulged - dominated galaxies ( see  [ redshift ] ) , and in studies of high - redshift galaxies the criterion @xmath124 is often used to separate spirals or disk galaxies from ellipticals ( e.g. , ravindranath et al .",

    "next , we estimate the relative expected contributions of the massive gns galaxy and the extra nic3/f160w sources to the overall 24  @xmath11 m flux by using the stellar mass ratio of the main massive gns galaxy ( e.g. , @xmath210 ) and of the contaminating source ( e.g. , @xmath211 ) , scaled by a function that takes into account the different redshifts of the two sources . specifically , for the two sources with stellar mass @xmath210 and @xmath211 , having redshifts @xmath212 and @xmath213 and luminosity distances @xmath214 and @xmath215 , the stellar mass ratio @xmath216 is scaled by @xmath217 . in 8 of 30 cases , the contribution of the extra nic3 contaminating sources to the overall 24  @xmath11 m flux is @xmath218 that of the main gns galaxy , and spans @xmath14 to @xmath219 .",

    "while the @xmath13 disky systems have a wide range of sfr@xmath231 ( 53 to 1466 @xmath2 yr@xmath28 at @xmath3 ) , they include the systems of the highest sfr@xmath231 at both @xmath25 and @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , the massive ultra - compact objects at @xmath3 are less likely by a factor of @xmath253 to have sfr@xmath231 above the detection limit , compared to the whole sample of non - agn massive galaxies .    using a variety of techniques ( x - ray properties ,",
    "ir power - law , and ir - to - optical excess ) to identify agn , we find that 49/166 ( @xmath394 ) of the massive galaxies at @xmath0 are agn candidates .",
    "the agn fraction rises with redshift , increasing from @xmath303 at @xmath304 to @xmath305 at @xmath3 ( table  [ tabagnfrak ] ) .",
    "we find a relationship between host galaxy structure and agn activity that complements the relationship between sfr and structure . among massive galaxies at @xmath3 ,",
    "agn appear to be found preferentially in galaxies that are not ultra - compact , as evidenced by the fact that most ( @xmath307 ) agn hosts have @xmath148 kpc .",
    "in fact , at @xmath3 , the agn fraction in ultra - compact galaxies is @xmath235 times lower than in extended galaxies ( @xmath308 versus @xmath309 ) .",
    "_ thus , ultra - compact galaxies appear quiescent in terms of both sfr and agn activity . _ in terms of their srsic index @xmath18 , a large fraction ( @xmath311 ) of agn hosts at @xmath3 have disky ( @xmath16 ) morphologies .",
    "we apply a standard schmidt - kennicutt law ( kennicutt 1998 ) to the sfr@xmath231 of the non - agn host candidates .",
    "the high estimated sfr@xmath231 suggest that copious cold gas reservoirs are present .",
    "we estimate that the average cold gas surface density in non - agn hosts ranges from @xmath395 to @xmath396 @xmath258  pc@xmath259 at @xmath0 , with a median value of @xmath397 @xmath258  pc@xmath259 ( figure  [ figfgas ] ) . the implied cold gas fraction within the rest - frame optical half - light radius ranges from @xmath398 to @xmath399 , with a mean of @xmath400 at @xmath3 ( figure  [ figfgas ] ) .",
    "the highest gas fractions at a given redshift are found among the less massive galaxies , consistent with downsizing .",
    "the massive galaxies at @xmath3 already have an average rest - frame optical surface brightness within @xmath19 that can be up to 3 - 6 magnitudes brighter than @xmath4 massive galaxies .",
    "the associated high stellar mass densities imply that massive galaxies at @xmath3 must have formed via rapid , highly dissipative events at @xmath17 . both gas - rich major mergers and gas accretion at @xmath17 are viable as their associated short dynamical timescales and short gas cooling times at @xmath17 would lead to a rapid buildup of mass .",
    "however , the large fraction ( @xmath6% ) of massive galaxies at @xmath3 with @xmath16 and disky morphologies suggest that cold - mode accretion at @xmath17 must have played an important role in the build - up of massive galaxies by @xmath3 , since it may be challenging to have such a large fraction of of merger remnants with low @xmath200 from isolated gas - rich major mergers .    in order for massive galaxies at @xmath3 to evolve into @xmath4 massive systems ( which are primarily e and s0s ) , they need to radically change their rest - frame optical structure and distributions of ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "in particular they need to raise @xmath18 well above 2 , increase @xmath19 by an average factor of 3 - 4 , and dim the average rest - frame optical surface brightness .",
    "dry major mergers can induce changes in galaxy size , srsic index , and stellar surface density , but they may be too rare to account for all the needed evolution .",
    "successive dry minor mergers have been shown to influence galaxy size , srsic index , and stellar surface density in a similar direction .",
    "we suggest the transformation of massive @xmath3 galaxies into @xmath4 galaxies will occur through a combination of dry major mergers , minor mergers",
    ". we will investigate in the relative importance and efficiency of these mechanisms in a future paper .",

    "it is not advisable to adopt a set of psf stars from a subset of pointings because the nic3 psf depends on position within the nic3 field and is also subject to interpolation artifacts introduced by ` drizzle ` that are dependent on the adopted dither pattern ( j. krist , private communication ) .    as a result ,",
    "the best available option for handling psf convolution is to make synthetic nic3 psfs with tiny tim ( krist 1995 ) . for each galaxy ,",
    "tiny tim psfs were generated for all the galaxy s positions in the individual , undrizzled exposures .",
    "telescope breathing was accounted for with each psf by refining the tiny tim parameters to match the pupil alignment mechanism ( pam ) value recorded in the headers of the undrizzled frames .",

    "this process was repeated for all 166 massive ( @xmath465 ) galaxies in our sample .",

    "could some of the galaxies with an @xmath16 have similarly good fits with higher @xmath18 ?",
    "first , one should note that the errors quoted by galfit on the structural parameters can not be used to assess the robustness of the fits because the errors quoted by galfit underestimate the true parameter errors ( hussler et al .",
    "2007 ) , which are dominated by the systematics of galaxy structure , and in particular , by parameter coupling and degeneracy .",
    "the task of assessing the coupling between model parameters is complicated when models have a large number of free parameters .",
    "the single srsic profiles fit to the nicmos galaxy images have 7 free parameters ( centroid , luminosity , @xmath19 , @xmath18 , axis ratio , and position angle ) .",
    "while galfit selects a best - fit by minimizing @xmath466 for a given set of input guesses , it is not clear whether the minimized @xmath466 is an absolute minimum or local minimum . investigating the @xmath466 values for all combinations of fit parameters over the full multi - dimensional parameter space is prohibitively time consuming and computationally expensive .",
    "instead , we will adopt a simpler approach of focusing on strong coupling between @xmath19 and @xmath18 , and exploring how @xmath466 varies as these parameters are moved away from the initial solution picked by galfit .",
    "one important point should be noted when using changes in @xmath466 , or @xmath467 , for fits to different models .",
    "when errors are normally distributed , the multi - dimensional ellipsoids for a given @xmath467 contour can be associated with a statistical confidence level ( e.g. , @xmath468 corresponds to a 68% confidence level ) .",
    "however , since the errors in the galfit models are not normally distributed , but are instead dominated by the systematics of galaxy structure , this means that we can not a priori assign a confidence level to a given @xmath467 . as outlined in the test below , we can still use the shape of @xmath467 as a function of @xmath18 or @xmath19 as a guide to the quality of fit in the sense that sharp rises in @xmath466 as @xmath18 is varied away from the best - fit value are taken as indicative of poorer fits .",

    "the associated best - fit parameters are @xmath470 and @xmath471 .",
    "we then fit single srsic profiles with @xmath18 fixed at discrete values ( 0.5 - 10 ) , while allowing all other parameters to freely vary .",
    "the initial inputs to these fits were the same as those used to generate the model in which @xmath18 is a free parameter .",
    "we let galfit find the best - fit for each of these fixed @xmath18 models by minimizing @xmath466 , and we record for each such best - fit the following quantities : the fixed value of @xmath18 , the best - fit value of @xmath19 , and the associated minimum in @xmath466 called @xmath472 .",

    "the test was carried out for all galaxies .",
    "figure  [ chitest ] shows the results of the test for four representative galaxies with @xmath473 .",
    "the first column of figure [ chitest ] shows how ( @xmath472-@xmath469 ) changes when @xmath18 is varied away from @xmath470 at discrete values ( 0.5 - 10 ) and galfit is allowed to vary all other parameters to get a best - fit that yields @xmath472 .",
    "the second column shows the corresponding best - fit @xmath19 for that @xmath472 .",
    "red stars in the plots denote @xmath470 and @xmath471 , which are associated with @xmath469 .",
    "the shape of @xmath472 - @xmath469 is asymmetric for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the coupling between @xmath18 and @xmath19 means ( @xmath472 - @xmath469 ) varies in a similar way with both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we can see that in figure  [ chitest ] , the absolute minimum @xmath466 values occur at the @xmath470 and @xmath471 values , which galfit picked when it was allowed to freely fit the galaxies without fixing @xmath18 .",
    "shifting @xmath18 away from @xmath470 ( denoted by the red stars ) by @xmath474 can increase @xmath472 by several 10s or 100s of @xmath466 units . while only 4 representative galaxies are shown in figure [ chitest ] , we show results for the whole sample in figure [ chihist ] .",
    "this figure illustrates that the distribution of ( @xmath472 - @xmath469 ) for @xmath475 ( top panel ) and @xmath476 ( bottom panel ) , and demonstrates for the whole sample , @xmath472 generally changes substantially when @xmath18 is shifted away from @xmath470 .",

    ", @xmath472 - @xmath469 rises sharply at lower @xmath478 , suggesting that lower @xmath18 values are unlikely to yield a good fit for such systems . at @xmath479 ,",
    "@xmath472 - @xmath469 rises less sharply , but the rise is still substantial as demonstrated in by the high - magnification inset plots in rows 3 and 4 of column 1 . 2 .",
    "the most important point to take from figure  [ chitest ] is that for galaxies with @xmath480 ( as in rows 1 and 2 ) , @xmath472 - @xmath469 rises rapidly at higher @xmath479 , thereby making it unlikely that a higher @xmath163 would provide a similarly good fit . _",
    "thus , we have a great degree of confidence that we are not highly overestimating the number of @xmath16 galaxies in the sample_.      section  [ decompcoupling ] tests how well parameters are recovered in real galaxies , but we can not a priori assign a confidence level to a given @xmath467 because the errors in the galfit models are not normally distributed . however , we can run an extra complementary test where we use simulated _ idealized _ galaxies whose ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) are a priori known .",
    "the drawback of using idealized galaxies as opposed to the real galaxies fitted in  [ decomp ] is that the former lack the complexity of real galaxies , since they are simply generated from galfit models and exactly described by a functional form , such as a sersic model with a specified ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , the advantage is that we do know the ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) values a priori and can therefore compare these values to those obtained once these idealized galaxies are inserted into frames with noise properties corresponding to the nic3 gns images of our sample galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "this test is performed by simulating 1000 galaxy images , each with a unique set of srsic parameters : surface brightness at the effective radius @xmath361 , effective radius @xmath19 , srsic index @xmath18 , axis ratio b / a , and position angle pa .",

    "the chosen range in input @xmath361 mimics the effect of surface brightness dimming , and the range in @xmath19 ensures the simulated objects span the angular size of the real gns galaxies .",
    "the simulated galaxies were created with galfit and convolved with a drizzled psf image .",
    "they were set within a sky background equivalent to the mean nic3 sky background within gns ( 0.1 counts / sec ) .",
    "source noise , sky noise , and read noise ( 29 @xmath185 ) were added to the frames .",
    "the simulated images were then re - fit with galfit to derive ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "initial guess parameters for ( @xmath361 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 , b / a , pa ) were generated randomly from uniform distributions spanning @xmath483 mag / arcsec@xmath51 in @xmath361 , @xmath484 in @xmath19 , @xmath485 indices in @xmath18 , 0.3 to 1 in b / a , and -90 to 90 degrees in pa .",

    "one might wonder whether the dramatic shift in figure  [ fnre ] of the @xmath3 galaxies toward lower ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) compared to the the @xmath136  0 mgc galaxies may be caused by systematic differences between the fitting techniques used by us versus those by allen et al .",
    "this would be the case only if the fits by allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) give systematically higher ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) than ours for the same galaxies . as we show below this",
    "is not the case .    in order to address this issue",

    "the comparison ( top row of figure  [ fmgc1 ] ) shows that the gim2d - based fits of allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are not biased to higher ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) compared to our galfit - based fits for the @xmath136  0 mgc galaxies . in fact , for large @xmath19 , the gim2d - based values may even be lower . in many cases .",
    "these results are consistent with extensive comparisons of single component srsic fits from galfit and gim2d conducted by hussler et al.(2007 ) on both simulated and real galaxy data .",
    "they concluded that both codes provide reliable fits with little systematic error for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses brighter than that of the sky , as long as one is not dealing with highly crowded fields .",
    "another possible source of difference between the structural parameters of the @xmath136  0 and @xmath3 massive galaxies might be the fact that allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) fitted the @xmath136  0 massive galaxies with only a single srsic component , and did not include an extra point source component in galaxies with evident nuclear sources .",
    "it seems unlikely that the much larger fraction of higher ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) systems at @xmath136  0 in figure  [ fnre ] is mainly driven by this effect . to illustrate this ,",
    "we have fitted the @xmath136  0 mgc galaxies in the top row of figure  [ fmgc1 ] with a combination of a single srsic component and a point source model using galfit .",
    "the bottom row of figure  [ fmgc1 ] shows the results .",
    "the values of @xmath19 are not changed systematically .",
    "the srsic index is lowered by the addition of the point source , but only 20% of the sources with @xmath163 in the single srsic fit have @xmath16 after including the point source . since not all @xmath136  0 mgc galaxies in figure  [ fnre ] will have nuclear sources , the fraction of sources impacted will be even less .",
    "we thus conclude that the presence of a point source in some of the @xmath136  0 mgc galaxies and the inclusion of such a point source in the model fits , are not sufficient to shift the @xmath136  0 mgc galaxies into the parameter space occupied by the @xmath3 massive galaxies in figure  [ fnre ] ."

    "<S> approximately 40% of massive galaxies are ultra - compact ( @xmath5 kpc ) , compared to less than 1% at @xmath4 . furthermore , most ( @xmath6% ) systems at @xmath3 have a low srsic index @xmath7 , compared to @xmath8 at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence that the @xmath7 systems at @xmath3 likely contain prominent disks , unlike most massive @xmath4 systems . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 )  there is a correlation between structure and star formation rates ( sfr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the majority ( @xmath9% ) of non - agn massive galaxies at @xmath3 , with sfr high enough to yield a 5@xmath10 ( 30@xmath11jy ) 24 @xmath11 m @xmath12 detection have low @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> ultra - compact galaxies appear quiescent in terms of both agn activity and star formation . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 )  large stellar surface densities imply massive galaxies at @xmath3 formed via rapid , highly dissipative events at @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the large fraction of @xmath7 disky systems suggests cold mode accretion complements gas - rich major mergers at @xmath17 . in order for massive galaxies at @xmath3 to evolve into present - day massive e / s0s </S>",
