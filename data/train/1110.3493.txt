    "therefore , at present , it is unclear whether the method of arakawa and kaneko can be used to prove and .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we propose , in section [ sec-1 ] , the problem of generalizing theorem [ main - t ] to the multiple case ; because this would lead , without using the duality , to multiple generalizations of and , that would imply an @xmath1-analogue of the arakawa - kaneko formula .",

    ". then we have @xmath138 which is uniformly convergent on any compact subset of @xmath80 though it is not absolutely convergent as we mentioned in section [ sec-2 ] .",
    "hence we can consider the indefinite integral of on @xmath80 , namely @xmath139 with a certain constant @xmath140 .",
