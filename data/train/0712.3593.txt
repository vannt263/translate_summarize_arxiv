    "this is the reason of the absence of a true bec in the one - dimensional system of hard rods , even at zero temperature .",
    "furthermore , it is also easy to understand that the decay is greatly enhanced in the high - density regime . indeed , as we see , contributions to the off - diagonal @xmath92 elements of the one - body density matrix at high density come mainly from the scenario described in fig .",

    "furthermore , the behavior of the momentum distribution of other exactly solvable 1d models describing interacting luttinger liquids can be related to the hard rod system though the value of the luttinger parameter .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig - nkfbx ] that the low density momentum distributions of both bosons and fermions are far from being gaussian , but also that the differences between @xmath94 and @xmath141 reduce when the density increases .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 and @xmath141 seem to approach a common profile that looks gaussian at low momenta , but this happens at even higher densities .",
    "this means that in the high density limit the contribution of the non  analytical parts of @xmath142 is less relevant , and also that in this limit the coefficients in the taylor expansion of the analytical part of @xmath142 are mostly dominated by the kinetic energy per particle , according to the cumulant expansion of eq .",
    "( [ cumul_rho1 ] ) .",
    "it is also apparent from the figure that the differences between the statistics vanish , as a function of the density , before the common profile is approached .",
    "still , one can not deduce from the simulation the analytical form of the large-@xmath108 behavior of the momentum distributions , and in particular whether a true gaussian is reached when @xmath143 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the one  body density matrix and momentum distribution of a fermi gas of hard rods , comparing them to their bosonic counterparts .",
    "we find that @xmath34 has a nodal structure quite close to that of the 1d free fermi gas , in agreement with haldane s theory of luttinger liquids .",
    "we have also discussed the analytical properties of @xmath34 to find that non ",
    "analytical parts become less relevant as the density increases .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm that the momentum distribution does not present a sharp gap at the fermi surface , but has infinite derivative at @xmath144 when the density is lower than a critical value @xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 for fermions and bosons share the same lower order moments while showing an overall fairly different shape .",
    "these differences reduce when the density increases , and remarkably the bose and fermi momentum distributions approach a common limit at high densities ."
