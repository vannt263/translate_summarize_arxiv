    "a well known problem in model reduction for partial differential equations ( pdes ) is the so - called _ stable model reduction _ problem .",
    "the goal is to use galerkin projection onto a suitable set of modes to reduce pdes to a small system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , while maintaining the main characteristics of the original model , such as stability and prediction precision .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on reduced order models obtained by the method of proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) @xcite , which has been widely used to obtain surrogate models of tractable size in fluid flow applications . however , it has been observed , e.g. , @xcite , that pod - roms can lose stability .",
    "maintaining stability is crucial for any rom to be accurate over long time intervals .",
    "we address the stable model reduction problem by using closure models , which are additive , viscosity - like terms introduced in the roms to ensure the stability and accuracy of solutions . through lyapunov theory , we propose a new closure model that is robust to parametric uncertainties in the model .",
    "the obtained closure model has free parameters , which we auto - tune with a model - free mes algorithm to optimally match predictions of the pde model .",
    "the idea of using extremum - seeking to auto - tune closure models has been introduced in @xcite , however , the difference with this work lies in the new formulation of _ robust _ closure models .",
    "furthermore , contrary to @xcite where the authors considered the simple case of the burgers equation , here we study the 3d boussinesq equations , which is a more challenging test - case and is directly applicable to a number of important control applications  @xcite .",
    "our work extends existing results in the field .",
    "stable model reduction of navier - stokes flow models by adding a nonlinear viscosity term to the reduced - order model is considered in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "incompressible flows are stabilized by an iterative search of the projection modes that satisfy a local lyapunov stability condition .",
    "an optimization - based approach for the pod modes of linear models , which solely focused on matching the outputs of the models is derived in @xcite .",
    "kalb and deane @xcite added error correction terms to the reduced - order model for improved accuracy and stabilization .",
    "moreover , the authors in @xcite calibrated the pod model by solving a quadratic optimization problem based on three different weighted error norms . stable model reduction for the navier - stokes and boussinesq equations using turbulence closure models was presented in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these closure models modify some stability - enhancing coefficients of the reduced - order ode model using either constant additive terms , such as the constant eddy viscosity model , or time and space varying terms , such as smagorinsky models .",
    "the amplitudes of the additional terms are tuned in such a way to accurately stabilize the reduced - order model .",
    "however , such closure models do not take into account parametric uncertainties in the model , and their tuning is not always straightforward .",
    "our work addresses these issues and proposes a new closure model in section  [ es - rom - stab ] that addresses parametric uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , we achieve optimal auto - tuning of this closure model using a learning - based approach , and is demonstrated using the 3d boussinesq equations in section  [ boussinesq ] . to set the stage",
    ", the following section establishes our notation .",
    "for a vector @xmath0 , the transpose is denoted by @xmath1 . the euclidean vector norm for @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 so that @xmath4 .",
    "the frobenius norm of a tensor @xmath5 , with elements @xmath6 , is defined as @xmath7 .",
    "the kronecker delta function is defined as : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we call a function analytic in a given set , if it admits a convergent taylor series approximation in some neighborhood of every point of the set . our pdes ( the boussinesq equations )",
    "are solved on the unit cube @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we shall abbreviate the time derivative by @xmath12 , and consider the following hilbert spaces : @xmath13 , @xmath14 for velocity and @xmath15 for temperature .",
    "thus , @xmath16 is the space of divergence - free vector fields on @xmath17 with components in @xmath18 .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are also considered in @xmath16 and @xmath19 .",
    "we define the inner product @xmath20 and the associated norm @xmath21 on @xmath22 as @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , for @xmath25 .",
    "a function @xmath26 is in @xmath27;\\mathcal{h})$ ] if for each @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 with analogous definitions for the vector valued functions in @xmath31 . to generalize the discussion below",
    ", we consider the abstract hilbert space @xmath32 , and later specialize to @xmath33 when considering the boussinesq equations .",
    "finally , in the remainder of this paper we consider the stability of dynamical systems in the sense of lagrange , e.g. , @xcite : a system @xmath34 is said to be lagrange stable if for every initial condition @xmath35 associated with the time instant @xmath36 , there exists @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 .",
    "we consider a stable dynamical system modeled by a nonlinear partial differential equation of the form @xmath39 where @xmath32 is an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "solutions to this pde can be approximated in a finite dimensional subspace @xmath40 through expensive numerical discretization , which can be impractical for multi - query settings such as analysis and design , and even more so for real - time applications such as prediction and control . in many systems ,",
    "including fluid flows , solutions of the pde may be well - approximated using only a few suitable ( optimal ) basis functions  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to reduced - order modeling through galerkin projection , which can be broken down into three main steps : one first discretizes the pde using a finite , but large , number of basis functions , such as piecewise quadratic ( for finite element methods ) , higher order polynomials ( spectral methods ) , or splines . in this paper",
    "we use the well - established finite element method ( fem ) , and refer the reader to the large literature , e.g. , @xcite , for details .",
    "we denote the approximation of the pde solution by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an @xmath43-dimensional finite element subspace of @xmath32 .",
    "secondly , one determines a small set of spatial basis vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , that well approximates the discretized pde solution with respect to a pre - specified criterion , i.e. @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the projection of @xmath49 onto @xmath42 , and @xmath50 is a matrix containing the basis vectors @xmath51 as column vectors .",
    "note that the dimension @xmath43 , coming from the high fidelity discretization of the pde described above , is generally very large , in contrast to the dimension @xmath52 of the optimal basis set .",
    "thirdly , a galerkin projection yields a rom for the coefficient functions @xmath53 of the form @xmath54 the function @xmath55 is obtained using the weak form of the original pde and galerkin projection .",
    "the main challenge in this approach lies in the selection of the ` optimal ' basis matrix @xmath50 , and the criterion of optimality used .",
    "there are many model reduction methods to find those basis functions for nonlinear systems .",
    "for example , some of the most used methods are proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) @xcite , dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd ) @xcite , and reduced basis methods ( rbm ) @xcite .",
    "we present the idea of closure models in the framework of pod .",
    "however , the derivation is not limited to a particular basis . indeed , these closure models can be applied to roms constructed from other basis functions , such as , dmd .",
    "the motivation comes from the fact that any low - dimensional basis necessarily removes the ability to represent the smallest scale structures in the flow and these structures are responsible for energy dissipation .",
    "the missing dissipation often must be accounted for with an additional modeling term to ensure accuracy and stability of the rom .",
    "[ remark_bouss_notation ] for our boussinesq example , we could maintain one set of coefficients for both velocity and temperature  @xcite .",
    "this would be reasonable for the class of free - convection problems considered here .",
    "however , to accommodate forced- and mixed - convection problems , we apply the pod procedure below for velocity and temperature data separately .",
    "we continue to use the framework in ( [ rom1_chap3 ] ) and consider separate basis functions for velocity , @xmath56^*$ ] for @xmath57 and temperature , @xmath58^*$ ] for @xmath59 .",
    "the different groups of coefficient functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 ) are associated with the independent variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "pod - based models are most known for retaining a maximal amount of energy in the reduced model  @xcite .",
    "the pod basis is computed from a collection of @xmath65 time snapshots @xmath66 of the dynamical system , usually obtained from a discretized approximation of the pde model in @xmath43 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath67 are time instances at which snapshots are recorded , and do not have to be uniform .",
    "the _ correlation matrix _",
    "@xmath68 is then defined as @xmath69 the normalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath68 are denoted by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath70 are also referred to as the _ pod eigenvalues_. the @xmath72th _ pod basis function _ is computed as @xmath73_j z_n ( t_{j},x),\\;i=1, ... ,r,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the number of retained pod basis functions and depends upon the application .",
    "the pod basis functions are orthonormal : @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the kronecker delta function .    in this new basis ,",
    "the solution of the pde ( [ general_pde_chap3 ] ) can then be approximated by @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the pod projection coefficients . to find the coefficients @xmath79 , the ( weak form of the ) model ( [ general_pde_chap3 ] )",
    "is projected onto the @xmath52th - order pod subspace @xmath80 using a galerkin projection in @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , both sides of equation ( [ general_pde_chap3 ] ) are multiplied by the pod basis functions , where @xmath81 is replaced by @xmath82 , and then both sides are integrated over @xmath17 . using the orthonormality of the pod basis ( [ pod_ortho_chap3 ] ) leads to an ode of the form ( [ rom1_chap3 ] ) .",
    "a projection of the initial condition for @xmath83 can be used to determine @xmath84 .",
    "the galerkin projection preserves the structure of the nonlinearities of the original pde .      we continue to present the problem of stable model reduction in its general form , without specifying a particular type of pde .",
    "however , we now assume an affine dependence of the general pde ( [ general_pde_chap3 ] ) on a single physical parameter @xmath85 , @xmath86 as well as    [ pdestab_assumption1_chap3 ] the solutions of the original pde model ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) are assumed to be in @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "we further assume that the parameter @xmath85 is critical for the stability and accuracy of the model , i.e. , changing the parameter can either make the model unstable , or lead to inaccurate predictions .",
    "since we are interested in fluid dynamics problems , we can consider @xmath85 as a viscosity coefficient .",
    "the corresponding reduced - order pod model takes the form ( [ rom1_chap3 ] ) and ( [ pod_proj_chap3 ] ) : @xmath89 the issue with this galerkin pod - rom ( denoted pod - rom - g ) is that the norm of @xmath90 , and hence @xmath91 , might become unbounded at a finite time , even if the solution of ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) is bounded ( lagrange stable ) .    the main idea behind the closure modeling approach is to replace the viscosity coefficient @xmath85 in ( [ rom3_chap3 ] ) by a virtual viscosity coefficient @xmath92 , whose form is chosen to stabilize the solutions of the pod - rom ( [ rom3_chap3 ] ) . furthermore , a penalty term @xmath93 is added to the original pod - rom - g , as follows @xmath94 the term @xmath93 is chosen depending on the structure of @xmath95 to stabilize the solutions of ( [ rom41_chap3 ] ) .",
    "for instance , one can use the cazemier penalty model described in @xcite .      here",
    "we introduce the first main result of this paper , namely a lyapunov - based closure model that is robust to parametric uncertainties .",
    "we first rewrite the right - hand side of the rom model ( [ rom3_chap3 ] ) to isolate the linear viscous term as follows , @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents a constant , negative definite matrix , and the function @xmath98 represents the remainder of the rom model , i.e. , the part without damping .",
    "we now consider the case where @xmath98 might be unknown , but bounded by a known function .",
    "this includes the case of parametric uncertainties in ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) that produce structured uncertainties in ( [ rom4_chap3 ] ) .",
    "to treat this case , we use lyapunov theory and propose a nonlinear closure model that _ robustly _ stabilizes the rom in the sense of lagrange .",
    "assume that @xmath98 satisfies    the norm of the vector field @xmath98 is bounded by a known function of @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "assumption [ pdestabgene_assumption1_chap3 ] allows us to consider a general class of pdes and their associated roms .",
    "indeed , all we require is that the right - hand side of ( [ rom3_chap3 ] ) can be decomposed as ( [ rom4_chap3 ] ) , where a linear damping term can be extracted and the remaining nonlinear term @xmath100 is bounded .",
    "this could allow for more general parametric dependencies and includes many structured uncertainties of the rom , e.g. , a bounded parametric uncertainty can be formulated in this manner .",
    "we now present our first main result .",
    "[ pdestabnlclosurebenos_chap3 ] consider the pde ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) under assumption [ pdestab_assumption1_chap3 ] , together with its stabilized rom model @xmath101 where @xmath98 satisfies assumption [ pdestabgene_assumption1_chap3 ] , @xmath102 is negative definite , and @xmath92 is given by @xmath103 here @xmath85 is the nominal value of the viscosity coefficient in ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) , and @xmath104 is the additional constant term .",
    "then , the nonlinear closure model @xmath105 stabilizes the solutions of the rom to the invariant set @xmath106    first , we prove that the nonlinear closure model ( [ nlingenterm1_chap3 ] ) stabilizes the rom ( [ rom5_chap3 ] ) to an invariant set .",
    "to do so , we use the following energy - like lyapunov function @xmath107 we then evaluate the derivative of @xmath108 along the solutions of ( [ rom5_chap3 ] ) , and use ( [ nlingenterm1_chap3 ] ) and assumption [ pdestabgene_assumption1_chap3 ] to write @xmath109 this shows convergence to the invariant set @xmath110 . @xmath111    note that @xmath112 and @xmath113 are negative , thus the sizes of @xmath92 and @xmath114 directly influence the size of @xmath110 .",
    "it is also apparent how the use of the term @xmath115 offers robustness when the uncertainty in @xmath95 is difficult to manage .      as discussed in the introduction as well as in @xcite",
    ", tuning the closure model amplitudes is important to achieve an optimal stabilization of the rom . in this study",
    ", we use model - free mes optimization algorithms to tune the coefficients @xmath104 and @xmath114 of the closure models presented in section [ closure_models_chap3 ] .",
    "an advantage of using mes over other optimization approaches is the auto - tuning capability that such algorithms allow for , as well as their ability to continually tune the closure model , _ even during online operation of the system_. indeed , we first use mes to tune the closure model , but the same algorithm can be coupled to the real system to continually update the closure model coefficients .",
    "note that mes - based closure model auto - tuning has many advantages .",
    "first of all , the closure models can be valid for longer time intervals when compared to standard closure models with constant coefficients that are identified offline over a ( fixed ) finite time interval .",
    "secondly , the optimality of the closure model ensures that the rom obtains the most accuracy for a given low - dimensional basis , leading to the smallest possible rom for a given application .",
    "we begin by defining a suitable learning cost function for the mes algorithm .",
    "the goals of the learning ( or tuning ) are i. ) to enforce lagrange stability of the rom model ( [ rom3_chap3 ] ) and ii . ) to ensure that the solutions of the rom ( [ rom3_chap3 ] ) are close to those of the approximation @xmath116 to the original pde ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) .",
    "the latter learning goal is important for the accuracy of the solution .",
    "we define the learning cost as a positive definite function of the norm of the error between the approximate solutions of ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) and the rom ( [ rom41_chap3 ] ) , @xmath117 where @xmath118^ * \\in\\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] denotes the learned parameters , and @xmath119 is a positive definite function of @xmath120 .",
    "note that the error @xmath120 could be computed offline using solutions of the rom ( [ rom41_chap3 ] ) and approximate solutions of the pde ( [ general_pde2_chap3 ] ) . the error could be also computed online where the @xmath121 is obtained from solving the model ( [ rom41_chap3 ] ) online , but the @xmath122 could be replaced by real measurements of the system at selected spatial locations @xmath123 .",
    "the latter approach would circumvent the fem model , and directly operate on the system , making the reduced order model more consistent with respect to the operating plant .",
    "a practical way to implement the mes - based tuning of @xmath124 , is to begin with an offline tuning of the closure model .",
    "one then uses the obtained rom ( with the optimal values of @xmath125 , namely @xmath126 ) in the online operation of the system , e.g. , control and estimation .",
    "we can then fine - tune the rom online by continuously learning the best value of @xmath125 at any given time during the operation of the system .",
    "to derive formal convergence results , we introduce some classical assumptions on the learning cost function .",
