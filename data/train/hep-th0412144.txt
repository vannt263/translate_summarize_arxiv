    "we consider in this brief report the problem of determining the effective charged - scalar - boson  charged - scalar - boson low energy potential @xmath2 arising from d - dimensional electromagnetism with a cutoff @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangian concerning this theory can be written as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the usual electromagnetic tensor field .",
    "lagrangian ( 1 ) is gauge and lorentz invariant ; in addition , it leads to local field equations which are linear in the field quantities . at distances much larger than the cutoff , the fields described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) become essentially equivalent to the maxwell fields .",
    "it worth mentioning that lagrangian ( 1 ) was proposed a long time ago , in 3 + 1 dimensions , by podolsky and schwed @xcite , in a rather different context .",
    "the main reason for investigating this theory is that recently it was shown that in its framework the electromagnetic mass of a point charge occurs in the equation of motion in a form consistent with special relativity ; moreover , the exact equation of motion does not exhibit runaway solutions or non - causal behavior , when the cutoff is larger than half of the classical radius of the electron @xcite .",
    "massive fermions , in turn , have their helicity flipped on account of their interaction with an electromagnetic field described by podolsky s generalized electrodynamics , while massless ones seem to be unaffected by the electromagnetic field as far as their helicity is concerned @xcite . now , as is well known , if one starts from a renormalizable theory and calculates the effective action one obtains typically several operators of dimension 6 ( or higher ) and not just podolsky s term @xcite .",
    "this raises the question : would these latter results change significantly if one takes all these terms into account ?",
    "since the amount of spin - flip is determined by the vector nature of the electromagnetic field but not by its spatial distribution , the aforementioned results will not change at all .",
    "what about the finiteness of the electromagnetic mass ?",
    "since the evaluation of the classical self - force acting on the point charge depends on the cutoff @xmath3 @xcite , one is led to conjecture that the finiteness of the electromagnetic mass is a very specific property of podolsky s electrodynamics and not a general feature of higher - derivative theories .",
    "it is interesting that the same route that leads to maxwell s electrodynamics leads also to podolsky s electrodynamics provided we start from podolsky s electrostatic force instead of the usual coulomb s law @xcite . unlike maxwell s electrodynamics , podolsky s generalized electrodynamics implies a finite value for the energy of a point charge in the whole space @xcite .",
    "we are motivated by two quite similar developments : in the first , we investigate whether @xmath1 can form  cooper pairs \" .",
    "our second topic is related to three - dimensional podolsky - chern - simons theory .",
    "based on the interesting discussions from jackiw @xcite about the consistency of the nonrelativistic limit of certain relativistically invariant quantum field theories , it can be shown that the chern - simons term alone is unable to form boson - boson bound states @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , numerical calculations indicate that the podolsky term provides an stabilizing mechanism allowing for the existence of ",
    "cooper pairs \" .",
    "we use natural units throughout ; our signature is @xmath6 .",
    "we begin by describing a method for computing the effective nonrelativistic potential for the interaction of two charged spinless bosons of equal masses via a  podolskian photon \" exchange .",
    "the prescription is based on the marriage of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "an algorithm for calculating the propagator is then presented .",
    "the recipe is used afterward to get the propagator for higher - derivative electromagnetism in the lorentz gauge .",
    "finally , we reduce the problem of computing the effective nonrelativistic potential to quadratures .      nonrelativistic quantum mechanics tells us that in the first born approximation the cross section for the scattering of two indistinguishable massive particles , in the center - of - mass frame ( com ) , is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the initial ( final ) momentum of one of the particles in the com . in terms of the transfer momentum , @xmath9 ,",
    "it reads    @xmath10    on the other hand , from quantum field theory we know that the cross section , in the com , for the scattering of two identical massive scalars bosons by an electromagnetic field , can be written a @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the initial energy of one of the bosons and @xmath13 is the feynman amplitude for the process at hand , which in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath14 reduces to    @xmath15    from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we come to the conclusion that the expression that enables us to compute the d - dimensional effective nonrelativistic potential has the form    @xmath16    which clearly shows how the potential from quantum mechanics and the feynman amplitude obtained via quantum field theory are related to each other .",
    "now , in the lorentz gauge podolsky s scalar qed is described by the lagrangian    @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the interaction lagrangian to order @xmath19 for the process @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes a spinless boson of mass @xmath22 and charge @xmath19 , is @xmath23 the feynman rule for the elementary vertex is shown in fig .",
    "1 . accordingly ,",
    "the feynman amplitude for the interaction of two charged spinless bosons of equal mass via a  podolskian photon \" exchange ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is    cc    &    l    @xmath24 +   +   +   +   +   +        @xmath25    where @xmath26 designates the  podolskian photon \" propagator .",
    "we propose now an algorithm for computing the propagator for electromagnetic theories with higher - derivatives , based on the usual transverse and longitudinal vector projector operators , namely @xmath27 which satisfy the relations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the set of operators @xmath30 is a complete set of projector operators for rank - one tensors .",
    "indeed , they are idempotent , mutually orthogonal and satisfy the completness relation @xmath31_{\\mu\\nu } = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu } \\equiv i_{\\mu\\nu}.$ ]    let @xmath32 be the lagrangian for electromagnetism with higher - derivatives . since @xmath32 is a gauge -invariant lagrangian , we add to it a gauge - fixing lagrangian @xmath33 , which implies that @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35 expanding @xmath36 in the basis @xmath37 , yields @xmath38 accordingly , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the propagator and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are parameters to be determined .",
    "now , taking into account that @xmath43 we promptly obtain    @xmath44    where we are supposing that both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are nonvanishing .",
    "note that the procedure we have just outlined is quite straightforward : on the one hand it reduces the work of calculating the propagator to a trivial algebraic exercise ; on the other hand it great simplifies calculations involving the contraction of conserved currents @xmath47 with the propagator since in this case the alluded contraction simply gives    @xmath48    from the above we find that the propagator for podolsky s electrodynamics in the lorentz gauge assumes the form    @xmath49    where @xmath50      from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) , we get immediately @xmath51 which implies    @xmath52    inserting eq . ( 9 ) into eq . ( 4 ) , we obtain    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 now , taking into account that    @xmath56    @xmath57    where @xmath58 denotes the bessel function , we arrive at the following expression for the potential    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61    on the other hand , it is trivial to show that @xmath1 can be evaluated from the expression    @xmath62 .",
    "hence , the problem of computing the effective nonrelativistic potential for @xmath63 was reduced to quadratures .    if eq .",
    "( 10 ) is correct , it must reproduce the podolskian potential in 3 + 1 dimensions . performing the computation for @xmath64",
    ", we get    @xmath65    which is just the same result as that obtained in podolsky s electromagnetic theory [ 1 ] .",
    "for @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( 10 ) yields    @xmath67,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath68 is an infrared regulator and @xmath69 is the modified bessel function .",
    "we discuss now the existence of boson - boson bound states in the context of planar quadratic electromagnetism .",
    "the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equation can be written as    @xmath70    @xmath71 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 is the @xmath73th normalizable eigenfunction of the radial hamiltonian @xmath74 whose corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the @xmath77th partial wave effective potential .",
    "on the other hand ,    @xmath78    which allows us to conclude that @xmath79 in the interval @xmath80 , implying that @xmath76 is strictly decreasing in this interval .",
    "consequently , in the framework of planar quadratic electromagnetism , no bound state concerning the two charged scalar bosons system exists .",
    "since boson - boson bound states do not show up in podolsky planar electromagnetism , we investigate here whether the effective boson - boson low energy potential related to podolsky - chern - simons ( pcs ) planar theory can bind a pair of identical charged scalar bosons .",
    "the lagrangian for pcs scalar qed , in the lorentz gauge , can be written as                                                            in order to find out whether or not boson - boson bound states could be formed , we shall analyze how @xmath120 behaves for small values of the cutoff @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , only if @xmath121 will the well recognized properties of @xmath122 be preserved . in this limit",
    ", we get      we assume from now on @xmath121 and @xmath124 , without any loss of generality .",
    "it is trivial to see that if @xmath125 , the potential is strictly decreasing , which precludes the existence of bound states .",
    "the remaining possibility is @xmath126 . in this interval @xmath115",
    "approaches @xmath127 at the origin and @xmath128 for @xmath129 , which is indicative of a local minimum .",
    "therefore , the existence of  cooper pairs \" is subordinated to the conditions @xmath121 and @xmath130 .    of course , it is impossible to solve eq .",
    "( 16 ) analytically ; however , it can be solved numerically . to do that",
    ", we rewrite beforehand the radial function as @xmath131 . as a consequence , eq .",
    "( 16 ) takes the form      using the numerov algorithm @xcite , we solved eq .",
    "( 17 ) numerically for several values of the parameters @xmath133 and @xmath77 , keeping the cutoff @xmath3 fixed .",
    "the latter was chosen equal to @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the fourdimensional classical radius of the electron .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the anomalous factor of @xmath136 in the inertia related to the abraham - lorentz model for the electron does not show up if if @xmath137 [ 2,3 ] .    in fig .",
    "3 we present our numerical results for the potential and the corresponding radial eigenfuntions concerning the first three bound states in the specific case of @xmath138 . the associated energies are      the graphics shown in fig . 3 exhibit , in a sense , the generic features of the potential and of the radial eigenfunctions , although they have been composed using particular values of the parameters @xmath140 and @xmath3 . a detailed study of the modifications of the effective potential induced by radioactive corrections , as well as the corresponding alterations to the eigenvalue structure ,",
