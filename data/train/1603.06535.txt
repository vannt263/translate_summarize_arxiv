    "in addition , ammi _ et al . _ performed a 3d splash experiment and recorded the results using two high - speed cameras , demonstrating that the mean ejection angle @xmath2 of a series of splashed grains is independent of both @xmath0 and the velocity of the incident grains @xmath3 , and it is close to @xmath4 @xcite . in their experiment ,",
    "a randomly packed ( rp ) bed was considered , and the final result suggests that the behavior at the first instance of impact during a splash process involving a granular bed has no influence on the later behavior .    in the present study , we perform numerical simulations in order to investigate the splash processes in more detail . assuming that the packing structure of a granular bed affects the splash behavior , we consider not only an rp bed ( an rp bed corresponds to the scenario examined in the experiment of ammi _",

    "we performed 3d splash process simulations using the dem for two kinds of granular bed structures : a randomly structured bed and an fcc - structured bed .",
    "it was found that the mean number of ejected grains for each collision was related to the injection energy .",
    "after renormalization by the energy transferred from the incident grain to the granular bed , a good linear fit was obtained between the mean number of ejected grains and the incident speed , with the rp bed ejecting twice as many grains as the fcc bed . moreover ,",

    "the grain movement direction is strongly affected by the surrounding grains in the fcc bed .",
    "furthermore , the ejection velocity distributions for the rp bed exhibited qualitatively good agreement with the results of previous experiments@xcite . on the other hand , coupled with the ejection angle results , the distributions obtained for the fcc bed indicate that the vertical movement of the ejected grains is dominant and that movement in the horizontal direction is significantly smaller than that for the rp bed .",
    "in addition , the ejected - grain characteristics , i.e. , the ejection angle and speed , evidently depend on the ejection timing after the initial grain impact . for the ejection angle",
    ", the difference between the ejected grain angles at the beginning and end of each splash is apparent .",
    "regarding the vertical ejection speed , the ejection timing determines the distribution , and this distribution changes from a power - law form to a log - normal form according to the ejection timing .",
    "furthermore , the splashed grains at the beginning of each splash gain retains around 80% of the total kinetic energy of the ejected grains .",
    "these results are assumed to be related to the propagation of the impact energy , both along and beneath the surface of the granular bed .",

    "<S> using the discrete element method ( dem ) , we study the splash processes induced by the impact of a grain on two types of granular beds , namely , randomly packed and fcc - structured beds . </S>",
    "<S> good correspondence is obtained between our numerical results and the findings of previous experiments , and it is demonstrated that the packing structure of the granular bed strongly affects the splash process . the mean ejection angle for the randomly packed bed is consistent with previous experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the fcc - structured bed yields a larger mean ejection angle ; however , the latter result has not been confirmed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ejection angle distributions and the vertical ejection speeds for individual grains vary depending on the relative timing at which the grains are ejected after the initial impact . </S>",
    "<S> obvious differences are observed between the distributions of grains ejected during the earlier and later splash periods : the form of the vertical ejection speed distribution varies from a power - law form to a lognormal form with time , and more than 80% of the kinetic energy of all ejected grains is used for earlier ejected grains . </S>"
