    "<S> we describe a continuous variable teleportation scheme that allows to teleport with high fidelity the quantum state of broadband multimode electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we call this scheme `` quantum holographic teleportation '' because it allows for reconstruction of an optical wavefront preserving its quantum correlations in space - time .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum teleportation allows for transportation of an arbitrary quantum state of a field from one place to another using classical information exchange . </S>",
    "<S> initially proposed for discrete variables@xcite , later on teleportation was extended to continuous - variable schemes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation for discrete variables was realized in @xcite for single - photon polarization states , and continuous - variable teleportation in@xcite for coherent state of electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> next challenging task is teleportation of truly nonclassical states like entangled states or so - called `` entanglement swapping '' . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of entanglement swapping was initially introduced for single - photon polarization states@xcite and has already been realized experimentally for single photons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are several proposals of entanglement swapping for continuous - variable teleportation schemes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from obvious interest to teleportation due to its fundamental quantum nature nonexistent in classical physics , there is a practical interest to this phenomenon stirred by potential applications in quantum error correction@xcite , quantum dence coding@xcite , and quantum cryptography@xcite .    to date </S>",
    "<S> , most theoretical schemes consider quantum teleportation of just a single - mode state of the field . </S>",
    "<S> such an assumption greatly simplifies analysis of the teleportation protocol and calculation of parameters describing the performance of the scheme . </S>",
    "<S> however , in reality one has to deal with optical signals distributed in space - time which have characteristic spatio - temporal scales such as coherence time and coherence area , for example . to understand the role of these parameters in teleportation process we have to abandon the single - mode approximation and generalize quantum teleportation for multimode states of electromagnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> while broadband teleportation of time - dependent signals has been already discussed in the literature@xcite , the spatial aspects of the problem has been ignored so far . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a full spatio - temporal teleportation protocol . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme allows us to teleport the quantum state of the distributed in space - time electromagnetic field , which can carry a spatial information like an optical image , or spatio - temporal information like an animation or a movie .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8.3 cm    our teleportation scheme is similar to that described in @xcite and is shown in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the input light field to be teleported from alice to bob is denoted by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the transverse coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> two quadrature components of the light field are detected `` point - by - point '' by two balanced homodyne detectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 formed by high efficiency multipixel photodetection matrices ( ccd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spatio - temporal quantum fluctuations of these quadrature components are locally imprinted into the photocurrents @xmath4 and @xmath5 on the output of individual pixels of ccd cameras . </S>",
    "<S> these photocurrents are sent from alice to bob via two multichannel parallel classical communication lines . </S>",
    "<S> bob uses these photocurrents for reconstruction of the field @xmath6 via two multichannel modulators @xmath7 and @xmath8 which modulate in space and time an incoming plane coherent light wave .    </S>",
    "<S> the essential part of the teleportation scheme is a pair of traveling - wave optical parametric amplifiers opa@xmath9 and opa@xmath10 used for creation of two broadband multimode entangled einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) light beams . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the multimode nature of entanglement created by the opas , our scheme allows for parallel teleportation with optimum fidelity of @xmath11 elements of the input wavefront , preserving the space - time correlations between these elements . </S>",
    "<S> this number is given by the ratio of the wavefront cross - section to the coherence area of the light created by opas . </S>",
    "<S> in the generic teleportation scheme @xcite @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the epr beams @xmath13 , n = 1,2 , are created by the interference mixing at the 50:50 beam splitter bs@xmath9 of the fields @xmath14 , m = 1,2 , in broadband multimode squeezed state , e_n(,t ) = _ m=1,2 r_nm s_m(,t ) , [ mixing ] where \\ { r_nm } = (    rr 1 & 1 + -1 & 1 +    ) , [ beamsplitter ] is the scattering matrix of the beam splitter bs@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the light waves @xmath14 in the broadband multimode squeezed state are created by two traveling - wave optical parametric amplifiers opa@xmath9 and opa@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed description of properties of such squeezed light can be found , for example in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation of the input fields @xmath15 in the vacuum state into the output fields @xmath14 in the broadband multimode squeezed state is described in terms of the fourier components of these operators in frequency and spatial - frequency domain , s_m(,)=ddt s_m(,t ) , [ fourier ] and similar for @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> these fourier components are related as follows , s_m ( , ) = u_m ( , ) a_m ( , ) + v_m ( , ) a_m^(-,- ) , [ squeezing ] where the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on the pump - field amplitudes of the opas , their nonlinear susceptibilities and the phase - matching conditions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatial and temporal scales of our teleportation scheme are determined by the orientation angle @xmath19 of the major axis of the squeezing ellipse , _ m ( , ) = \\{u_m ( , ) v_m(-,- ) } , [ psi ] and by the degree of squeezing @xmath20 , e^r_m ( , ) = |u_m(,)| |v_m(,)| . </S>",
    "<S> [ exponential ] in analogy to the single - mode epr beams , the multimode epr beams are created if squeezing in both channels is effective , and the squeezing ellipses are oriented in orthogonal directions . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity we shall assume that opa@xmath9 and opa@xmath10 have such properties that , @xmath21 v_1 ( , ) = - v_2 ( , ) v ( , ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ orthogonal ] this situation is realized , for example , for broadband multimode squeezing produced by an opa with type - ii phase matching@xcite . in the latter case two </S>",
    "<S> independent squeezed beams correspond to two orthogonal polarization components of the field with the following properties , @xmath22 _ 1 ( , ) = _ 2 ( , ) /2 ( , ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ orthogonal_2 ] under these conditions the epr fields are entangled for the frequencies @xmath23 and spatial frequencies @xmath24 within the phase matching of the opa .    for observation of two quadrature components of the input field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 the input beam is mixed with one of two epr beams , @xmath25 , at the beam splitter bs@xmath10 with the same scattering matrix as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ beamsplitter ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the input fields of the balanced homodyne detectors @xmath2 , @xmath3 as @xmath26 b_p(,t ) = ( -a_in(,t ) + e_1(,t ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ mixing_2 ] these fields in turn are mixed with the local oscillator fields lo@xmath27 and lo@xmath28 having complex amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath29 is real , at beam splitters bs@xmath31 and bs@xmath32 with the same scattering matrices as for bs@xmath9 and bs@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that pixels of the ccd matrices have the area much smaller than the coherence area @xmath33 of the epr beams . </S>",
    "<S> in this case it can be shown that the photocurrents collected from individual pixels of d@xmath27 and @xmath3 at the point @xmath34 are given by , @xmath35 i_p(,t ) = b_0 ( b_p(,t ) - b^_p(,t ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ current ] these photocurrents are sent from alice to bob via two multichannel classical communication lines and are used by bob for local modulation of an external coherent wave , phase matched with the squeezed fields @xcite . in the modulated beam </S>",
    "<S> the field component @xmath36 is created . </S>",
    "<S> the teleported field @xmath37 is obtained by interference mixing on the mirror m with hight reflectivity of the modulated field with the second epr beam @xmath38 , a_out(,t ) = e_2(,t ) + g(i_x(,t ) -i i_p(,t ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ out_coord ] here @xmath39 is the coupling constant which takes into account the efficiency of modulation and the transmission of the mirror m. the teleportation takes place when @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the teleported field @xmath37 in the form , a_out(,t ) = a_in(,t)+f(,t ) , [ out_fourier ] where f(,t ) = e_2(,t ) + e_1^(,t ) , [ noise ] is the noise field , added by the teleportation process . in the ideal case of perfect entanglement of two epr beams at all frequencies @xmath23 and spatial frequencies @xmath24 the terms @xmath38 and @xmath41 are perfectly anticorrelated and their quantum fluctuation cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> this would correspond to the perfect `` point - to - point '' in space and instantaneous in time teleportation of the quantum state of the input field with an arbitrary distribution in space and time , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> however such teleportation would require infinitely large energy of epr beams . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , firstly as in the single - mode case , one would have to achieve an infinite squeezing per single coherence volume of an epr beam . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , since now we have broadband multimode entanglement , one would need an infinite number of elementary coherence volumes in the epr beams . in practice teleportation </S>",
    "<S> will never be point - to - point in space and instantaneous in time but always `` on average '' within some spatial area and within some finite time interval .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to verify that teleportation has actually taken place and to evaluate its quality we shall follow the strategy employed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and introduce the third party , victor . </S>",
    "<S> he will make two measurements with the fields @xmath0 and @xmath37 and according to the results of these measurements he will decide whether teleportation was successful or not .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that victor performs his own homodyne detection measurement of an arbitrary quadrature component of the _ in _ and _ out _ fields determined by the angle @xmath43 , i_out^()(,t ) = a_0 ( a_out(,t)e^-i+ a_out^(,t)e^i ) , [ current_2 ] where @xmath44 is the real amplitude of victor s local oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> for evaluation of the teleportation quality victor observes the photocurrent noise spectrum of the teleported field defined as , @xmath45\\ ] ] i^()_out(,0 ) i^()_out(,t ) , [ spectrum_def ] where @xmath46 is the fluctuation of the photocurrent around its mean value . </S>",
    "<S> he compares this spectrum with an analogous noise spectrum @xmath47 for the input field . using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ out_fourier ] ) and relations between the epr fields and the input fields of the opas we obtain , @xmath48 . + e^2r ( , ) ^2 ( , ) } . </S>",
    "<S> [ spectrum_res ] let us consider first teleportation of a classical plane monochromatic wave , i.  e.  when the fourier component of @xmath0 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 is in coherent state and all other components in vacuum state . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 . without squeezing , @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath53 . in this classical limit of teleportation </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the three - dimensional noise spectrum of photocurrent is multiplied by the same factor 3 , as the one - dimensional @xmath23-dependent spectrum in the single - mode case .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum teleportation superseding this classical limit is possible when ( i ) there is an effective squeezing , @xmath54 , in a certain region of frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath23 , and ( ii ) the orientation angle @xmath55 within this region is @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> it was shown earlier that the @xmath23-dependence of the angle @xmath55 can be compensated by the frequency - dependent refraction index of nonlinear medium  @xcite , and the @xmath24-dependence is to large extent compensated by a thin lens properly inserted after the opa  @xcite . assuming that opas have phase matching degenerate in frequency and angle , we can introduce the coherence area @xmath57 and the coherence time @xmath58 for the epr fields . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing is effective for @xmath59 and @xmath60 the three - dimensional photocurrent noise spectra of the _ in _ and _ out _ fields become identical within this range of frequencies and spatial frequencies , @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to quantum teleportation which can not be achieved without broadband multimode epr beams shared by alice and bob .    the low - frequency noise suppression in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spectrum_res ] ) means that if the photocurrents are collected from the area @xmath62 during the time @xmath63 , the fluctuations in the _ in _ and _ out _ measurements have similar statistics . in the opposite case of measurement with @xmath64 , @xmath65 the high - frequency noise contribution in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spectrum_res ] ) degrades the quality of teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for the space - time distributed fields the concept of teleportation fidelity must include coarse - grained description with the scales @xmath33 , @xmath66 of the epr beams .    </S>",
    "<S> the teleportation fidelity is degraded due to the noise field @xmath67 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ out_fourier ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the commutation relations for @xmath67 correspond to classical noise , [ f(,t),f^(,t ) ] = 0 , = 0 . </S>",

    "<S> [ functional_def ] our calculations which will be published elsewhere give , @xmath69 . </S>",

    "<S> [ green ] it follows from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ functional_res ] ) that the noise is gaussian and the correlation functions of the fields @xmath67 and @xmath72 of an arbitrary order are expressed in standard way via the second - order correlation functions f(,t ) f^(,t)= g(-,t - t ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ pair ] incidentally , similar green function describes the photocurrent correlations in space - time by the homodyne detection of multimode squeezed light  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> mean that noise on the scales @xmath64 , @xmath81 is not eliminated , but on the scales @xmath82 , @xmath83 effective entanglement results in significant noise suppression .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed the protocol for quantum teleportation of the distributed in space - time light fields . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol is based on the entanglement between the corresponding coherence volumes @xmath84 of the broadband multimode epr fields produced by two traveling - wave opas . </S>",
    "<S> every such volume determines an elementary degree of freedom of the input field , whose quantum state can be effectively teleported , i.  e.  the `` resolving power '' of teleportation .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ out_fourier ] ) , which relates in the heisenberg picture the _ out _ field to _ in _ field , that any average product of the _ out _ fields , taken at arbitrary space - time points , is equal to the analogous average product of the _ in _ fields plus average noise term which can be made small using entangled epr beams . </S>",
    "<S> that is , our protocol preserves the space - time quantum correlations in the _ in _ field . </S>",
    "<S> teleportation with these features can be called _ </S>",
    "<S> quantum holographic teleportation_.    in fact , in our three - dimensional generalization of the continuous variable teleportation protocol @xcite one can easily recognize an extension to the quantum domain of the conventional non - stationary holography . as in holography , the distributed in space - time input field is mixed with the local oscillator waves . </S>",
    "<S> classical photocurrent densities @xmath85 and @xmath86 are equivalent to non - stationary holograms , each for one of two quadrature components . these holograms are transmitted via classical multichannel communication lines and used for reconstruction of both quadrature components of the input field by means of non - stationary modulation of the beam from an external laser . </S>",
    "<S> the novel feature , which converts the holography to the quantum holographic teleportation is a pair of broadband multimode epr beams shared by alice and bob . </S>"
