    "entangled states are used as resource for quantum teleportation  @xcite . the success of quantum teleportation is quantified by optimal teleportation fidelity .",
    "the strength of entanglement is proportional to the success of teleportation for pure entangled resources .",
    "maximally entangled pure states give maximum optimal teleportation fidelity of unity . on the other hand , for mixed states , success of teleportation",
    "depends , in addition to strength of entanglement , on mixedness of the state  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that , for mixed entangled states , there is an upper bound on mixedness above which the state is useless for quantum teleportation .",
    "upper bounds on measures of mixedness , namely , von neumann entropy and linear entropy were obtained for a general bipartite @xmath0 state .",
    "mixed entangled states can be classified according to their rank @xmath1 , where the rank @xmath1 varies between @xmath2 and @xmath3 for a bipartite @xmath0 system . in the present work , we obtain rank dependent upper bounds on measures of mixedness , above which the states of respective ranks become useless for quantum teleportation .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we observed that mixedness and entanglement of a mixed state resource independently influence teleportation . for a state with a fixed value of mixedness ,",
    "the state being entangled is only necessary for it to be a resource for quantum teleportation , but not sufficient .",
    "states with low mixedness and high entanglement turn out to be ideal resources for quantum teleportation .",
    "we argued based on the numerical work on a class of maximally entangled mixed states that there exists a rank dependent lower bound on a measure of entanglement such as concurrence , below which the states are useless for quantum teleportation . in this article , we derive rank dependent lower bounds on concurrence for a bipartite @xmath4 systems .",
    "werner state defined as a probabilistic mixture of maximally entangled pure state and maximally mixed separable state , exhibits highest mixedness for a given optimum teleportation fidelity among all the two qubit mixed entangled states known in the literature .",
    "werner state  @xcite is a rank 4 state . in the present study",
    ", we generalize the construction and obtain second and third rank werner states .",
    "we show that rank dependent werner states exhibit the respective rank dependent bounds obtained on measures of mixedness and entanglement for a given value of teleportaion fidelity .",
    "we consider two measures of mixedness of a state @xmath5 , namely , von nuemann entropy defined as @xmath6  @xcite and linear entropy given as @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "further , the maximum achievable teleportaion fidelity of a bipartite @xmath8 system in the standard teleportation  @xcite scheme is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the singlet fraction of @xmath5 given by @xmath11 . here",
    "the maximum is over all maximally entangled states . and maximum fidelity achieved classically is @xmath12 .",

    "we have state @xmath18 of rank @xmath1 of @xmath21 systems as , @xmath22 @xmath23 is the basis formed from @xmath24 maximally entangled states .",
    "we have from the definition of singlet fraction the largest element , say @xmath25 of @xmath26 is greater than or equal to @xmath27 . and",

    "@xmath28 shannon entropy in eq.([shannon ] ) is maximum for @xmath29 and rest of @xmath30 elements are equal , subjected to the constraint @xmath31 , we get the upper bound as    @xmath32    this implies , @xmath33 this shows that for @xmath17 satisfying eq.([von ] ) , the singlet fraction is greater than @xmath27 . thus , we prove if @xmath34 , state @xmath18 is useless for quantum teleportation .",
    "we also obtain an analytical expression for the rank dependant upper bound on linear entropy as a measure of mixedness as @xmath35 for @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 where @xmath1 is the rank of the state , which varies from 2 to 4 . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , based on the analysis of a class of maximally entangled mixed states of @xmath4 bipartite system given in  @xcite , we observed that for a given value of linear entropy , there exists a rank dependent upper bound on the optimal teleportation fidelity and the upper bound increases with increase in the rank .",
    "this is equivalent to stating that for a given value of optimal telportation fidelity , there exists a rank dependent upper bound on linear entropy and the upper bound increases with rank .",
    "the above result allows us to calculate the upper bounds explicitly .",
    "if the optimal teleportation fidelity is fixed as @xmath38 , the classical fidelity , the upper bound on linear entropy for states of second , third and fourth ranks are @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "states with linear entropy above the respective rank dependent upper bounds are useless for teleportation .",
    "a class of maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) is constructed by ishizaka et .",
    "al  @xcite and the construction is as follows .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 are the eigenvalues of the state @xmath5 @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the werner state , which is a convex sum of maximally entangled pure state and maximally mixed separable state , given by @xmath45 werner state corresponds to a choice of eigenvalues given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "werner state is a state of rank 4 .",
    "the singlet fraction for werner state is @xmath48 and linear entropy is estimated as @xmath49 .",
    "the value of linear entropy at which fidelity is equal to classical limit can be found as @xmath50 , which is same as the upper bound obtained above for states of rank 4 .",
    "this correspondence motivated us to construct werner like states of ranks 2 and 3 .",
    "a rank @xmath51 werner state can be constructed by using eigenvalues as @xmath52,@xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we have @xmath55 and linear entropy is equal to @xmath56 .",
    "thus it is clear that @xmath57 for a value of linear entropy greater than @xmath58 , which is the obtained upper bound for rank 3 states . to construct rank @xmath2 werner state we take @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we get singlet fraction and linear entropy as @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "it clearly shows that rank @xmath2 werner state is useless for teleportation when linear entropy is greater than @xmath64 , coinciding with the theoretical upper bound shown above .",
    "thus , we illustrate that the constructed rank dependent werner states exhibit the theoretical upper bounds on the linear entropy for a given value of optimal teleportaion fidelity .",
    "the relationship between the concurrence as a measure of entanglement of state @xmath5 and it s purity is well studied , the degree of entanglement decreases as purity decreases .",
    "the maximum possible value of concurrence of a state @xmath5 for a spectrum of eigenvalues  @xcite @xmath65 in descending order is given as @xmath66 in our previous work , we also observed that there exist a rank dependent lower bound on concurrence for a fixed value of optimal teleportation fidelity and the lower bound decreases with increase in the rank of the state . in the present work ,",
    "we obtain the exact rank dependent lower bounds on the concurrence for a @xmath4 bipartite states .",
    "we find that the eigenvalues @xmath67 and equal values of rest of the @xmath68 @xmath69 minimize @xmath70 among all eigenvalue spectra .    by substituting the values for @xmath71 ,",
    "that is , corresponding to rank @xmath1 , @xmath72 and rest of @xmath68 elements are equal , we get the lower bound on the concurrence of state @xmath18 of rank @xmath1 below which the state fails to be a source for quantum teleportation .",
    "we obtain the values of lower bound on concurrence for the failure of teleportation for rank 4,3 and 2 states as follows , @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively . from this",
    "we clearly show that there exist a lower bound on concurrence for a fixed value of fidelity , this lower bound decreases as rank increases for two qubit systems .",
    "the lower bound on concurrence for failure of quantum teleportation for rank dependent werners states coincide with the bounds derived in this work .",
    "lower and upper bounds on teleportation fidelity as a function of concurrence are obtained in  @xcite . the upper and lower bounds on fidelity @xmath75 for a concurrence @xmath76 are given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the upper bound on fidelity as a function of concurrence coincides with werner state of rank 4 . based on the properties of lower rank werner states constructed in this work",
    ", we conjecture that there exist rank dependant bounds on fidelity as a function of concurrence and these bounds which also coincide with werner states of lower ranks .",
    "the maximum amount of fidelity of a rank three state as a function of concurrence is given as @xmath79 , in the same way the amount of teleportation fidelity for rank two state is given by werner state of rank 2 as @xmath80 .",
    "teleportation fidelity as a function of concurrence for rank dependent werner states are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "werner states of different ranks exhibit respective rank dependent lower bounds on concurrence below which the state is useless for quantum teleportation .",
    "it can be seen that , in the fidelity - concurrence plane , the allowed values of teleportation fidelity for a fixed value of concurrence of @xmath4 states is bounded below and above by curves corresponding to second and fourth rank werner states respectively .",
    "fidelity of second and fourth rank werner state also coincide respectively with lower and upper bounds on fidelity of @xmath4 states obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the curve corresponding to werner state of rank 3 , which lies between the curves of upper and lower bounds , serves as an upper bound on teleportation fidelity of rank 3 mixed states .",
    "this implies , quantum teleportation can be achieved with a resource of low value of concurrence , then it has to be a high rank state .",
    "for example , if we have to use a state with concurrence 0.1 as a quantum teleportation resource , it has to be necessarily a fourth rank state .",
    "in  @xcite it is shown that local environment can enhance fidelity of quantum teleportation .",
    "it is shown that for a class of density matrices , interaction with environment enhance the singlet fraction above @xmath81 , and thus making the state useful for quantum teleportation .",
    "there are other methods  @xcite like entanglement purification , local filtering , entanglement concentration for single and multiple number of qubits can be made use to improve the teleportation fidelity of quantum channels . in this context",
    "it is important to understand whether the rank dependant bounds on fidelity as a function of linear entropy and concurrence are preserved under operations that enhance fidelity .",
    "we understand that the operations involved in enhancing fidelity need not preserve the rank and hence rank dependant bounds are valid as long as the state is of the respective ranks .",
    "it can be stated that for fixed values of concurrence and linear entropy of a state of fixed rank @xmath1 , the maximum achievable teleportation fidelity is that of werner state of rank @xmath1 .",
    "we proved the existence of rank dependent upper bound on the von neumann entropy as well as linear entropy as measures of mixedness of a general mixed state of a bipartite @xmath0 system for failure of the state to be resource for quantum teleportation .",
    "we constructed rank 3 and rank 2 werner states .",
    "rank dependent werner states exhibit the theoretical upper bounds obtained on von neumann entropy and linear entropy .",
    "further , we proved the existence of rank dependent lower bounds on the concurrence of a @xmath4 mixed states for the failure of states as resource for quantum teleportation and showed that the lower bound on concurrence for rank dependent werner states coincide with the theoretical lower bounds .",
    "we also showed the rank dependant werner states give upper and lower bounds on fidelity as a function concurrence , which are consistent with the results in the literature .",
