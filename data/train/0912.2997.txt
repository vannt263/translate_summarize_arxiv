    "the illustration of a void in a @xmath1cdm universe is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdmvoid ] by a sequence of 6 timesteps . because the density within underdense regions gradually increases outward ,",
    "we see a decrease of the corresponding peculiar ( outward ) gravitational acceleration : void matter in the centre moves outward faster than void matter towards the boundary .",
    "this leads to matter accumulating in ridges which surround the void , while the interior evolves into a uniform low - density region resembling a low - density homogeneous frw universe .",
    "the steepness of the resulting density profile depends on the protovoid depression @xcite . in",

    "subsequently , their expansion will slow down with respect to the earlier linear expansion .",
    "this impelled ref .   to identify voids in the present - day galaxy distribution with voids that have just reached the stage of shell - crossing .",
    "it happens when a primordial density depression attains a linearly extrapolated underdensity @xmath11 ( for an eds universe , see sec  [ sec : voidexcur ] ) .",

    "the voids that we see nowadays in the galaxy distribution do probably correspond to regions whose density is @xmath12 of the mean cosmic density ( note that it may be different for underdensity in the galaxy distribution ) .    note that while by definition voids correspond to density perturbations of at most unity , @xmath14 , mature voids in the nonlinear matter distribution do represent _ highly nonlinear _ features .",
    "this may be best understood within the context of lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "overdense fluctuations may be described as a converging series of higher order perturbations .",

    "the bottom - left frame of fig .  [ fig : gifvoid ] shows these profiles for the linear section along the solid line indicated in the other three frames .",
    "the density profile does confirm to the general trend of low - density regions to develop a near uniform interior density surrounded by sharply defined boundaries .",

    "the comparison with the top two frames demonstrates the strong relation with features in the particle distribution and the density field .",
    "not only it is slightly elongated along the direction of the void s shape , but it is also sensitive to some prominent internal features of the void . towards the `` se '' direction the flow appears to slow down near a ridge , near the centre the dtfe reconstruction identifies two expansion centres .",
    "the void velocity field profile is intimately coupled to that of its density field .",
    "the linear velocity increase is a manifestation of its general expansion .",
    "the near constant velocity divergence within the void conforms to the _ super - hubble flow _ expected for the near uniform interior density distribution . because voids are emptier than the rest of the universe they will expand faster than the rest of the universe with a net velocity divergence equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined to be the ratio of the super - hubble expansion rate of the void and the hubble expansion of the universe .",
    "various studies have found strong indications for the imprint of voids in the peculiar velocity flows of galaxies in the local universe . ref .   made the first claim of seeing pushing influence of voids when assessing the stronger velocity flows of galaxies along a filament in the first cfa slice .",
    "stronger evidence came from the extensive and systematic potent analysis of mark iii peculiar galaxy velocities @xcite in the local universe @xcite .",

    "this conclusion agree with that reached on the basis of an analysis of the peculiar velocity of the local group by ref .  .",

    "the effective gravitational acceleration is stronger along the short axis than along the longer axes . for overdensities",
    "this results in a stronger inward acceleration and infall , producing increasingly flattened and elongated features .",
    "by contrast , for voids this translates into a larger _ outward _ acceleration along the shortest axis so that asphericities will tend to diminish .",
    "for the interior of voids this tendency has been confirmed by n - body simulations @xcite .    in reality",
    ", voids will never reach sphericity . even though voids tend to be less flattened or elongated than the halos in the dark matter distribution ,",
    "they are nevertheless quite nonspherical : ref .   find that they are slightly prolate with axis ratios of the order of @xmath26 .",
    "this agrees with the statement by ref .   and ref .",
    "that in realistic cosmological circumstances voids will be nonspherical .",
    "this is also quite apparent in images of , for example , the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "the flattening is a result of large scale dynamical and environmental factors , amongst which we can identify at least two important factors @xcite . even while their internal dynamics pushes them to a more spherical shape they will never be able to reach perfect sphericity before encountering surrounding structures such as overdense filaments or planar walls . even more important may be the fact that , for voids , external tidal influences remain important : voids will always be rather moderate densities perturbations since they can never be more underdense than @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite represents a better description for the evolution of voids than that of collapsing overdense peaks .",
    "overdense regions contract into more compact and hence steeper density peaks , so that the area in which the ellipsoidal model represents a reasonable approximation will continuously shrink .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen the natural tendency of voids is to develop an increasingly uniform interior density field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sphervoid ] ) : while they expand their interior gets drained of matter and develops a flat `` bucket - shaped '' density profile .",
    "in many respects the homogeneous model is a better approximation for underdense regions than it is for overdense ones .",
    "evidently , the approximation is restricted to the interior and fails at the void s outer fringes because of its neglect of the domineering role of surrounding material , such as the sweeping up of matter and the encounter with neighbouring features .",
    "the homogeneous ellipsoidal model assumes an object to be a region with a triaxially symmetric ellipsoidal geometry and a homogeneous interior density , embedded within a uniform background density @xmath27 .",
    "consider the simple situation of the external tidal shear directed along the principal axes of the ellipsoid .",
    "the gravitational acceleration along the principal axes of an ellipsoid with over / underdensity @xmath28 can be evaluated from the expression for the corresponding scale factors @xmath29 , @xmath30\\,{\\cal r}_{\\rm m}\\,-\\,\\tau_{\\rm m}\\ , { \\cal r}_{\\rm m}\\,+\\,\\lambda r_m\\ , , \\label{eq : ellipseqnmot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also taken into account the influence of the cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "the factors @xmath31 are the ellipsoidal coefficients specified by the integral equation , @xmath32    the influence of the external ( large - scale ) tidal shear tensor @xmath33 enters via the eigenvalue @xmath34 . from eqn .",
    "[ eq : ellipseqnmot ] , it is straightforward to appreciate that as @xmath28 grows strongly nonlinear , the relative influence of the large - scale ( near-)linear tidal field will decline .",
    "however , the density deficit @xmath28 of voids will never exceed unity , @xmath35 , so that the importance of the factor @xmath34 remains relatively large .",
    "its impact can be so strong that it not only effects an anisotropic expansion of the void , but even may manage to make an initially spherically expanding void to collapse ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : voidcoll ] ) .",
    "large scale tidal influences not only manifest themselves in the shaping of individual voids .",
    "they are also responsible for a distinct alignment of substructures along a preferred direction , while they are also instrumental in their mutual arrangement and organization .",
    "locally , the orientation of a void turns out to be strongly aligned with the tidal force field generated by structures on scales up to at least @xmath36 .",
    "this goes along with a similar mutual alignment amongst voids themselves .",
    "they have strongly correlated orientations over distances @xmath37 @xcite , a scale considerably exceeding the typical void size .",

    "two processes dictate the evolution of voids : their _ merging _ into ever larger voids as well as the _ collapse _ and disappearance of small ones embedded in overdense regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : voidhier ] ) .      first , consider a small region which was less dense than the critical void density value .",
    "it may be that this region is embedded in a significantly larger underdense region which is also less dense than the critical density .",
    "many small primordial density troughs may exist within the larger void region .",
    "once small density depressions located within a larger embedding underdensity have emerged as true voids at some earlier epoch , their expansion tends to slow down .",
    "when the adjacent subvoids meet up , the matter in between is squeezed in thin walls and filaments .",
    "the peculiar velocities perpendicular to the void walls are mostly suppressed so that the flow of matter is mostly confined to tangential motions .",

    "the timescale on which the internal substructure of the encompassing void is erased is approximately the same as that on which it reaches maturity .",
    "the final result is the merging and absorption of the subvoids in the larger void emerging from the embedding underdensity .",
    "hence , as far as the void population is concerned only the large void counts , while the smaller subvoids should be discarded as such .",

    "by contrast , the evolution of overdensities is governed only by the _ cloud - in - cloud _ process ; the _ cloud - in - void _ process is much less important , because clouds which condense in a large scale void are not torn apart as their parent void expands around them .",
    "this asymmetry between how the surrounding environment affects halo and void formation is incorporated into the _ excursion set approach _ by using one barrier to model halo formation and a second barrier to model void formation . only the first barrier matters for halo formation ,",

    "a manifest environmental influence which still needs to be understood is the finding that void galaxies appear bluer , a trend which continues down into the most rarefied void regions .",
    "another issue of interest is whether we can observe the intricate filigree of substructure in voids , expected as the remaining debris of the merging voids and filaments in the hierarchical formation process .",
    "void galaxies do appear to have significantly different properties than average field galaxies .",
    "they appear to reside in a more youthful state of star formation and possess larger and less distorted supplies of gas .",
    "analysis of void galaxies in the sdss and 2dfgrs indicate that void galaxies are bluer and have higher specific star formation rates than galaxies in denser environments @xcite .",
    "while these trends appear to be quite general , controversy persists in the literature as to whether or not galaxies in voids differ in their internal properties from similar objects in denser regions .",
    "part of this relates to the selection of void galaxies .",
    "there are distinct differences between the majority of these galaxies , residing in the moderate underdense environment near the boundary , and those in the deepest realms , @xmath63 , where some 10% of the void galaxies resides .",
    "the most recent results on the basis of sdss dr6 @xcite and 2dfgrs @xcite do indicate that these are intrinsic differences : at fixed morphology and luminosity the faintest void galaxies are intrinsically bluer and have higher star formation rates .",
    "it may certainly be true that , following the interpretation by ref .",
    ", because structure grows more slowly in the low - density environment of voids the galaxy population in voids is younger",
    ". an additional effect may be that star formation events may be triggered more easily by galaxy encounters in the low velocity dispersion environment of voids @xcite .",
    "interestingly , voids also contain nearly normal ellipticals @xcite .",
    "it seems that the red sequence of ellipticals in the color - magnitude diagram from sdss is almost independent of environment @xcite , contrasting sharply to the significant blueward shift of the blue sequence in voids @xcite .",
    "if major mergers produce ellipticals , it is not obvious how galaxies in the least dense regions , where interactions are rare , acquire these properties . careful examination of ellipticals in voids may therefore reveal important clues to the balance of nature vs. nurture in galaxy formation .",

    "even though a crucial factor for understanding their recent formation and star formation history , less is known about the gas content of void galaxies .",
    "possible systematic trends in the ratio of hydrogen mass to stellar mass are crucial for understanding the influence of the void environment on the galaxies star formation history .",
    "the morphology of the gas layer , in particular that of the outskirts , may reflect their isolated existence .",
    "the earliest systematic survey of hi in void galaxies is that of the galaxies in the botes region @xcite .",
    "it comprised pointed observations of 24 iras selected galaxies .",
    "sixteen were detected with sufficient amounts of hydrogen , most of which were late - type , gas - rich and usually disturbed systems .",
    "interesting was the finding of 18 new galaxy companions in the vicinity of the known galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , most of the observed galaxies were residing in the outer realms of the void and with some reason might have been identified with the moderate density environment of walls .",
    "an important additional hi study of void galaxies involved the search for dwarf galaxies in the local void @xcite .",
    "the fact that they were only found at the edge of the void and avoid its interior represents a major challenge for our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "some well - known nearby luminous galaxies whose hi layers have been studied in detail , ie . ngc6946 and m101 ,",
    "are actually found within the local void .",
    "it is rather intriguing that e.g. ngc6946 is known to undergo a substantial level of gas inflow and has a large gas disk bearing the marks of numerous recent supernovae @xcite .",
    "galaxies in and around voids are also searched for in the hipass @xcite and alfalfa survey @xcite .    .",
    "see stanonik et al .",
    "2009a.,width=491 ]    the most sensitive and systematic study of gaseous void galaxies is our ( ongoing ) wsrt hi survey of sdss galaxies .",
    "it consists of a sample of around 55 galaxies , sufficiently large to probe the morphological diversity of void galaxies and voids of different size , shape and underdensity .",
    "it involves a unique selection procedure in that it is based upon finding void galaxies in the deepest underdensities of the dtfe reconstruction of the density field ( dtfe : delaunay tessellation field estimator ) in the ( dr7 ) sdss redshift survey @xcite .",
    "[ fig : sdsssel ] illustrates the void galaxy selection pipeline .",
    "each sample galaxy is optically selected from sdss / dr7 and has to be located in the central interior region of a nearby void identified from the sdss survey .",
    "al sample galaxies are at a considerably closer distance than the botes void .",
    "most galaxies in our sample are blue , a few red ( see 10 specimen fig .  [",
    "fig : sdsssam ] ) .",
    "results of the pilot study are reported in ref .   and ref .  . with 14 detections out of of 15 void galaxies",
    ", the detection rate of the pilot survey has been 93% @xcite .",
    "the one without a detection is the reddest galaxy in the sample .",
    "the hi content of the 14 detected galaxies ranges from @xmath64 m@xmath65 to @xmath66 m@xmath65 .",
    "their optical radii are small , 5 - 10 kpc , while they have hi disks that extend far beyond the optical and appear to be in regular rotation .",
    "nearly 2/3rd appear asymmetric or slightly warped at the faintest contour levels .",
    "three galaxies turn out to be uniquely interesting systems .",
    "one is part of a system of three galaxies , all aligned in the plane of the sky , stretching out over 57 kpc , and connected by an hi bridge possibly related to a tenuous void filament .",
    "a second galaxy shows regular disk rotation in its hi distribution .",
    "however , optically it exhibits a clumpy , knotty morphology similar to that seen in chain - galaxies forming at high redshift .",
    "it also has a companion .",
    "the most outstanding specimen of the sample is a polar disk galaxy @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : void03 ] ) . amongst the most lonely galaxies in the universe",
    "( 4 mpc up to the nearest ugc and ngc galaxy ) , it has a massive , star - poor hi disk that is perpendicular to the disk of the central void galaxy .",
    "no optical counterpart to the hi disk has been found , even though the central galaxy is actively forming stars .",
    "the ring reveals a regular rotation pattern .",
    "the galaxy is located within a what looks like a tenuous wall in between two large roundish voids .",
    "the central optical disk is strongly inclined with respect to the surrounding wall ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the unique void environment forces a reappraisal of the traditionally assumed formation mechanisms for such polar ring galaxies , by a close interaction or merger .",
    "its existence may point to a slow hi accretion dictated by the unique environment , possibly at the crossing point of the outflow from the two voids .",
    "+      with respect to their spatial distribution , void galaxies are found to display a significant luminosity dependence .",
    "the consensus is that there is a good statistical agreement between theory and observation of the large voids defined by @xmath68 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the observed density contrast of bright galaxies in large voids , around 1/10 of the cosmic mean @xcite , is consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "however , conflicts arise when we look at the distribution and properties of lower luminosity / mass objects . from optical and hi surveys ,",
    "ref .   found that the density of faint ( @xmath69 ) galaxies is only @xmath70 that of the mean .",
    "this forms a marked contrast to the prediction by high - resolution @xmath1cdm simulations that voids have a density of low mass ( @xmath71 ) halos that is 1/10 that of the cosmic mean @xcite .",
    "the dearth of dwarf and/or low surface brightness void galaxies represents a major challenge for the standard cosmological view of galaxy formation .",
    "the simplest models of galaxy formation @xcite predict that voids would be filled with galaxies of low luminosity , or galaxies of some other uncommon nature @xcite .",
    "ref .   pointed out that the observed salient absence of dwarf galaxies in nearby voids could possibly involve strong ramifications for the viability of the @xmath1cdm cosmology on small scales .",
    "branded with the name _ void - phenomenon _ , the issue has been marked as a _",
    "`` a crisis for the cdm model '' _ since peebles strongly emphasized the notion that nearby voids do _ not _ appear to contain the expected population of dwarf and/or low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "various processes and influences have been forwarded as an explanation for the missing void dwarfs within the context of existing galaxy formation theories .",
    "these involve environmental properties of dark matter halos and astrophysical procesess , ranging from supplementary baryonic physical processes and radiation feedback processes .",
    "the nature of the environmental influence on the formation of halos has been addressed in a variety of studies .",
    "high - resolution simulations now clearly predict dependence of the shape , concentration , spin , and mean age of formation of halos on their environment @xcite , particularly so for lower mass halos . because the mass function of halos shifts to lower masses in voids these effects should be most noticeable among void galaxies @xcite .",
    "ref .   and ref .",
    "modelled the dependence of the properties of galaxies on the halos they inhibit to infer the properties of voids in the galaxy distribution . according to ref .",
    ", halo models would explain away the void phenomenon .",
    "however , the implied spatial segregation between galaxies of different luminosities in and near voids does not bear much resemblance to reality .",
    "the issue still seems far from solved and progress will depend largely on insights offered by new observational data .    amongst the most plausible astrophysical explanations for the absence of dwarfs in voids",
    "is the ionizing influence of the uv background in suppressing the star forming capacity of low mass halos @xcite .",
    "however , ref",
    ".   showed that these effects would not explain the distribution of dwarf galaxies in voids . also the suggestion that supernova feedback would be instrumental in evicting gas from the shallow potential wells of the dwarfs does not seem to offer an explanation .",
    "simulations by ref",
    ".   showed that most internal properties of dwarf galaxies can be reproduced without invoking supernova feedback .",
    "our voyage along the empty realms of our universe has been made possible by the many inspiring and instructive discussions and keen insights of those who shared the experience along minor or major parts of the journey .",

    "<S> in this contribution we review and discuss several aspects of cosmic voids . </S>",
    "<S> voids are a major component of the large scale distribution of matter and galaxies in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> their instrumental importance for understanding the emergence of the cosmic web is clear . </S>",
    "<S> their relatively simple shape and structure makes them into useful tools for extracting the value of a variety cosmic parameters , possibly including even that of the influence of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps most promising and challenging is the issue of the galaxies found within their realm . not only does the pristine environment of voids provide a promising testing ground for assessing the role of environment on the formation and evolution of galaxies , the dearth of dwarf galaxies may even represent a serious challenge to the standard view of cosmic structure formation . </S>"
