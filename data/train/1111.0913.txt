    "the large majority of extragalactic tev photons emitters belongs to the class of blazars : radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with a relativistic jet closely oriented towards the earth @xcite .",
    "the typical spectrum emitted by a blazar is non thermal and covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum , as sketched in fig  1 .",
    "it is composed by two bumps : at low energies the emission is synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons , while at higher energies the origin of the radiation is more uncertain .",
    "the most credited models , referred as leptonic models , involve the inverse compton scattering mechanism to explain the high energy emission .",
    "however , alternative models taking into account the presence of a hadronic component in the emission are not ruled out .    at gev and tev regimes ,",
    "the photon energy flux emitted by a blazar is usually well approximated with a power law of the form @xmath1 .",
    "an important effect involving vhe photons emitted by blazars is the production of electron - positron pairs ( @xmath2 ) , caused by the interaction with the ebl @xcite .",
    "ebl is composed of stellar light emitted and partially reprocessed by dust throughout the entire history of cosmic evolution .    due to the lack of direct ebl knowledge",
    ", many models have been elaborated in the last years  @xcite , but the uncertainties remains quite large .",
    "quantitatively , the effect of the interaction of vhe photons with ebl is an exponential attenuation of the flux by a factor @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the optical depth , function of both photon energy and source redshift .",
    "this is represented in fig .  1 , where , due to the absorption , the observed tev spectrum ( continuous line ) differs significantly from the emitted spectrum ( dashed line ) .",
    "the observed differential energy spectrum from a blazar is related to the emitted one according to @xmath5 .    in principle",
    "it is possible to derive the emitted ( or intrinsic ) spectrum by deabsorbing the observed spectrum .",
    "this procedure depends on the absorption coefficient @xmath4 and the redshift @xmath6 of the source .",
    "vice versa , if the intrinsic source spectrum is known , given the absorption coefficient @xmath4 , the redshift @xmath6 can be estimated comparing the absorbed spectrum with the observed one . here",
    ", we use the second approach .        [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the shaded area represents the two sources with uncertain redshift ( s5  0716 + 714 and 3c  66a ) , not used in the gaussian fit.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]        following the first study , we investigate the distribution @xmath8 , difference between the values @xmath9 , listed in the last column of table  [ table_values ] , obtained by inverting the linear formula @xmath9  =  ( @xmath10 , and the true redshifts , @xmath11 .",
    "the histogram obtained , figure  [ fig : dispersion_fradom_fermi1y ] , is well fitted by a gaussian of @xmath12 , which can be assumed as the error on the reconstructed redshift , @xmath9 , estimated with this method . in the histogram ,",
    "the two sources with uncertain redshift , not used for the gaussian fit , lie outside the expected interval .",
    "this result confirms that the behaviour of s5  0716 + 714 and 3c  66a is different from that found for other sources and suggests that or these sources are peculiar , or their redshift is incorrect .    in conclusion",
    ", we can say that with an enlarged data set the results previously found are confirmed .",
    "however , the linearity of the @xmath13@xmath11 relation has a smaller probability , due to the reduced errors of the new @xmath14 determinations .",
    "as a final application , we use our method on pks  1424 + 240 , a blazar of unknown redshift recently observed in the vhe regime by veritas @xcite . the slope measured by _",
    "fermi_/lat in the energy range 0.1100gev is @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath13 at which the slope of the deabsorbed tev spectrum becomes equal to it is @xmath16 , filled circles in fig .",
    "[ 1424_plot ] .",
    "this result is in agreement with the value of @xmath17 , reported in @xcite , calculated by applying the same procedure but using only simultaneous lat data .",
    "our estimate on the most probable distance for pks  1424 + 240 is 0.26@xmath180.05 , where the error is the @xmath19 of the gaussian fitting the @xmath20z distribution .",
