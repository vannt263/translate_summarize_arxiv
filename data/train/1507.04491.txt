    "security is a major concern in a connected vehicular network .",
    "on one hand , the wireless , ad - hoc , and mobile communication imply security threats , while on the other hand , require perfectly reliable communication , as errors have immediate hazardous implications  @xcite .",
    "the intelligent transportation systems ( its ) has been regulated as per the standard ieee 1609 dedicated short range communication ( dsrc )  @xcite and ieee 802.11p wireless access for vehicular environment ( wave )  @xcite . also , the security configurations have been standardized as ieee 1609.2  @xcite for the online security and iso 26262  @xcite for the functional risk assessment during automotive life cycle . while vehicles move in a predictable road topology ,",
    "maneuvering among the vehicles is somewhat unpredictable .",
    "for example , the vehicle ordering is changed dynamically along the road and over time . identifying a vehicle is crucially important in the scope of establishing secure communication with passing by vehicles . in particular , using public key infrastructure to establish secure sessions among the moving vehicles is not secure against man - in - the - middle ( mitm ) attacks .",
    "therefore , we propose to modify the conventional certificate structure and facilitate vehicle to vehicle authentication through certificate exchange .",
    "* applications of vehicular networks .",
    "* gaining on - road safety and efficient traffic management are two prime goals in the use of vehicular networks which is gradually penetrating into the internet of things ( iot ) communication paradigm .",
    "a survey on trust management for iot  @xcite and the available candidate internet engineering task force ( ietf ) solutions across the network layers has been given in  @xcite .",
    "smart vehicles may exchange information concerning road scenario with each other to help manage the traffic and to address safety concerns  @xcite . for example",
    ", data sharing , remote resource access , payments on the go , a notification on the occurrence of an accident or a traffic jam ahead may assist the approaching vehicles to optimize their time and energy resources . in the very near future",
    ", vehicles will interact with several other vehicles to coordinate actions  @xcite and to provide heterogenous media services  @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been a great deal of interest to integrate cloud services with the dynamic vehicular communication .",
    "considering the scalability issues and rapid data exchange in vehicular networks in  @xcite authors have shown an integrated secure mobile cloud computing  @xcite on top of dynamically scattered cyber - physical vehicle networks .",
    "evidently , these kind of ubiquitous services and real - time applications would definitely require an extended spectrum capacity along with the high - speed gigabit data transfer .",
    "therefore , a great deal of research is being directed to materialize a new cellular networking paradigm termed as 5 g  @xcite , which would essentially realize the vision of next - generation ad - hoc networks .",
    "several major projects  @xcite , for example , car2car - communication consortium  @xcite , cartalk  @xcite , network on wheels  @xcite , vehicle infrastructure integration  @xcite , partners for advanced transportation technology  @xcite , secure vehicular communication  @xcite , e - safety vehicle intrusion protected applications  @xcite were conducted in order to initiate , develop and standardize the vehicle network operation .",
    "these projects were funded by national governments and accomplished by a joint venture of automobile companies , universities and research organizations .",
    "currently , the vehicle communication research is rapidly trending towards the security aspects  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the focus in this paper is to provide secure wireless communication that is secure against any impersonation attacks by a third party",
    ".        * problem statement . *",
    "public key infrastructure has a severe disadvantage when coping with mitm attacks not only in the scope of vehicle networks . in the common practice public keys",
    "are signed by the authorities and can be verified by the receiver . in the scope of vehicle ( ad - hoc ) networks ,",
    "secure interaction among the peer vehicles should be established rapidly without any third party assistance .",
    "thus , no interaction with the certificate authority ( ca ) during the session key exchange is feasible and an impersonation attack among the moving vehicles is possible .",
    "the following scenario demonstrates a typical mitm attack as shown in figure  [ figure : psf ] .",
    "the scenario starts when a vehicle @xmath0 tries to securely communicate with @xmath1 and requests for the public key of @xmath1 .",
    "vehicle @xmath2 pretends to be @xmath1 and answers @xmath0 with @xmath2 public key instead of @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath2 concurrently asks @xmath1 for its public key .",
    "vehicle @xmath0 is fooled to establish a private key with @xmath2 instead of @xmath1 , and @xmath1 is fooled to establish a private key with @xmath2 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "vehicle @xmath2 conveys messages from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and back , decrypting and re - encrypting with the appropriate established keys . in this way",
    ", @xmath2 can find the appropriate moment to change information and cause hazardous actions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    * our contribution . *",
    "our work demonstrates the utility of out - of - band identification  @xcite using a coupled public key and fixed verifiable attributes .",
    "the certified attributes may be visually verified by a camera , microphone , wireless transceiver fingerprint identification  @xcite , and other sensing devices .",
    "we ensure the countermeasures against the mitm attack in two sequential and explicit rounds of communication .",
    "* _ twofold authentication : _ we propose a solution that employs a fixed attribute based certification mechanism to correctly identify the neighboring vehicles .",
    "visual identification  @xcite implies more robust authentication of the transmission source in comparison with the signal noise and/or transceiver fingerprint verification .",
    "our solution relies on the verification that the public key was originated by the ca , and that the public key belongs to the vehicle with the coupled signed attributes .",
    "the periodic licensing routine can serve as an important ingredient of our protocol . * _ periodic certificate restore : _ our method has the benefit of interacting with the ca only during preprocessing stages , rather than during the real - time secret session key establishment procedure .",
    "given such certified public key and vehicle attributes , the protocol establishes a secret session key with neighboring authenticated vehicles using only two communication rounds . *",
    "_ adaptation : _ the proposed approach can be integrated with the existing authentication protocols without beaching the respective security claims in these existing protocols . therefore , the security claims are strengthened while adapting the proposed approach with the proven authentication protocols . *",
    "_ verification : _ the proposed approach satisfies the secrecy and authentication properties .",
    "these security claims have been verified using an extended security analysis in spi calculus .",
    "* related work . * in this section , we illustrate the related work , concerning vehicle network threats , state of the art for mitigating mitm attacks .",
    "then we describe existing entity authentication schemes , and in particular , the utility of out - of - band communication for the authentication purposes .    _ vehicle networks threats . _",
    "an autonomous wireless connection among vehicles imposes serious security threats such as eavesdropping  @xcite , identity spoofing  @xcite , sybil attack  @xcite , wormhole attack  @xcite , replay attack  @xcite , message content tampering  @xcite , impersonation  @xcite , denial of service attack ( dos )  @xcite and man - in - the - middle attack  @xcite . in  @xcite an anti - spoofing scheme based on mutual egress filtering ( mef ) using a compressed access control list ( acl ) over border routers",
    "is presented .",
    "furthermore ,  @xcite presents a survey of security challenges in cognitive radio networks ( crn ) with respect to exogenous / jamming , intruding , greedy attackers and crucial routing metrics . _ mitigating man - in - the - middle attacks . _",
    "global system for mobile communication ( gsm ) is one of the most popular standards in cellular network infrastructure .",
    "unfortunately , it uses only one sided authentication between the mobile station and the coupled base station  @xcite .",
    "the universal mobile telecommunication standard ( umts ) improves over the security loopholes in gsm .",
    "it includes a mutual authentication and integrity protection mechanism but is still vulnerable to mitm attacks  @xcite .",
    "mitm and dos attack analysis for session initiation protocol ( sip ) is shown in  @xcite , using a triangle communication model between sip user agent and server .",
    "this work presents an analysis on the attack possibility , but does not offer any solution to the problem in hand .",
    "the interconnection between 3 g and wireless lan is vulnerable to mitm attacks by influencing the gateway nodes  @xcite . according to  @xcite , mobile hosts and",
    "the base station share a secret cryptographic function and mutually raises a challenge - response string , prior to employing the original diffie - hellman key exchange scheme  @xcite .",
    "thus , the mobile host replies with a cryptographic response and subscriber station identifier ( ssi ) to a base station , but it does not verify any of the unchangeable attributes of the intended subscriber . this way a base station , capable of verifying a unique ssi connection , may not confirm the authentic owner of the ssi connection .",
    "furthermore , position - based routing schemes for vehicular networks  @xcite would play a crucial role in a reliable secure communication .",
    "it may further be extended to energy saving such as a delay tolerant routing approach for vehicle networks  @xcite that allows a delay bounded delivery by combining a carry - and - forward mechanism with the replication mechanism .",
    "dynamic backpressure - based routing protocol for delay tolerant networks ( dtns ) is given in  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , routing decisions are made on a per - packet basis using queue logs , random walk and data packet scheduling as opposed to static end - to - end routes .",
    "similarly , a stability based routing scheme to synergise noise ratio , distance and velocity into a routing decision is given in  @xcite .",
    "a reliable multicast protocol for lossy wireless networks using opportunistic routing with random linear network coding  @xcite and a genetic algorithm based approach is presented in  @xcite .",
    "_ entity authentication .",
    "_ there has been a great research activity in the scope of cryptographic solutions  @xcite for the entity authentication .",
    "a security scheme for sensor networks , called tesla has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "tesla is based on delayed authentication with self - authenticating key chains .",
    "tesla yields a time consuming authentication mechanism ( as the messages are received on a timeline can be authenticated only after receiving the immediate next message over the same timeline ) .",
    "although , chances are less , but a mitm can still intercept through weak hash collisions and fake delayed key .",
    "an improvement tesla++ has been suggested in  @xcite , as an adapted variation of delayed authentication .",
    "a combination of tesla++ and digital signature provides denial of service ( dos ) attack resilience and non - repudiation respectively .",
    "the drawback with this approach is that the message digest and corresponding message ( with self - authenticating key ) are transmitted separately to the receiver .",
    "thus , mitm may step in , as it does not follow the fixed attribute based verification . furthermore ,",
    "another scheme for anomaly - detection and attack trace back for encrypted protocols  @xcite and ip spoofing trace back is given in  @xcite .",
    "raya and haubaux  @xcite proposed that each vehicle contains a set of anonymous public / private key pairs , while these public keys have been certified by ca .",
    "the certificates are short lived , and therefore , need to be confirmed with a certificate revocation list ( crl ) before the use .",
    "the drawback with this approach is that roadside infrastructure is required to provide the most updated crl .",
    "a mitm attack resistant key agreement technique for the peer to peer wireless network is suggested in  @xcite where the primary mutual authentication is done before the original diffie - hellman key exchange .",
    "this primary authentication step could be a secret digest comparison , e.g. , through visual or verbal contact , distance bounding or integrity codes .",
    "however , a mitm can intercept because of the proximity awareness , visual and verbal signals , computed by the device and verified by the user ; while in our case it is already certified by the ca and then user verifies it again .",
    "moreover , the authors in  @xcite presented an incentive mechanism for peer - to - peer networks in order to encourage user cooperation as opposed to selfish behaviour and another software defined network ( sdn ) security in  @xcite .",
    "the secure communication scheme , in  @xcite is an enhancement over the raya and haubaux scheme , in that a certified public key is exchanged and further used to set up a secret session key as well as a group key . here",
    ", the attacker can pretend to be some other vehicle , by replaying the certificates and there currently exists no other means to verify that this vehicle is not the actual owner of the certificate .",
    "in addition  @xcite presents a secure ( i.e. proactive secret sharing scheme ) and privacy preserving ( identity blinding ) key management scheme resilient to time and location based mobile attacks proposed for the m - healthecare social networks  @xcite .",
    "_ out - of - band channel authentication .",
    "_ there have been great efforts to utilize various auxiliary out - of - band channels for entity authentication . the notion of pre - shared secret over a limited contact channel",
    "was first raised in  @xcite .",
    "the pre - authentication channel is a limited scope channel to share limited information but it inherits the same vulnerability that a wireless channel has . in this scheme , there may be cases when a vehicle authenticates the sender but is not able to verify the specific identity traits . in our scheme",
    "we do it in reverse , first the certified attribute verification over the wireless channel and then the static attribute verification over the out - of - band channel of communication .    a method shown , in  @xcite , suggests that a common movement pattern can help to mutually authenticate two individual wireless devices driven by a single user . in  @xcite , a pre - authentication phase is used to verify the identity , before the original public key is exchanged and confirmed over the insecure wireless channel .",
    "another work , in  @xcite , presents a visual out - of - band channel .",
    "a device can display a two dimensional barcode that encodes the commitment data , hence , a camera equipped device can receive and confirm this commitment data with the available public key . unfortunately the attacker can still capture and/or fabricate the visible commitment data , as it is not coupled with the public key .",
    "the approach in  @xcite is based on acoustic signals , using audio - visual and audio - audio channels to verify the commitment data . in the audio - visual scheme , a digest of the public key",
    "is exchanged by vocalizing the sentence and comparing with a display on the other device , while the audio - audio scheme , compares vocalized sentences on both devices . in a recent work",
    "@xcite , light emitting diode ( led ) blinks and the time gap between those blinks has been used to convey the digest on the public key . also , a combination of an audio - visual and an out - of - band channel has been proposed in  @xcite , that uses beeps ( audio ) and led blinks ( visual ) in a combination to convey the commitment data .",
    "the proposed method is less effective because the public key and the out - of - band information is not certified therefore mitm can record the out - of - band information and replay it .",
    "the approach in  @xcite suggested the use of spatial reference authentication such as correlating latency with the distance which can be faked by a mitm attacker .",
    "in particular , all identification techniques presented in  @xcite are not coupled with the public key in a signed form , therefore , allows an mitm attacker to penetrate .",

    "the proposed approach is specifically designed and ready to use for the recently customized vehicles with following configurations .    * system settings . *    _ customized standards and hardware for vehicles . _",
    "the vehicles are assumed to be equipped with electronic control units ( ecus ) , sensors , actuators  @xcite and the wireless transceiver that support the dsrc ( dedicated short range communication ) standard  @xcite .",
    "these ecu s are interconnected over a shared bus to trigger a collaborative decision on some safety critical events .",
    "furthermore , a wireless gateway is installed to connect the in - vehicle network with the external network or device for the diagnosis purposes .",
    "the in - vehicle network can be divided into the controller area network ( can ) , local interconnect network ( lin ) , and media oriented system ( most )  @xcite based on the technical configurations and the application requirements .",
    "these embedded devices enable facilities such as automatic door locking , collision warnings , automatic brake system , reporting road conditions , rain and dark detection and communication with the surrounding road infrastructure .",
    "therefore , vehicles must be equipped with the fundamental communication capabilities as per the vehicular communication standards mentioned above .",
    "our protocol would provide a secure communication on top of the available and standardized communication schemes in these customized vehicles .",
    "_ registration and identity certification .",
    "_ in addition , with the technical configurations that a vehicle must be equipped with , a trusted third party is also required periodically for the successful execution of the proposed approach in this paper . currently , every vehicle is periodically registered with its national or regional transportation authority , which allocates a unique identifier to the vehicle with an expiration date which usually is the next required inspection date . in some regions of the united states and europe , registration authorities have made substantial progress toward electronically identifying vehicles and machine readable driving license .",
    "according to the state of the art these registration authorities would assign a public / private key pair to the inspected vehicles for a secret information exchange",
    ". however , our protocol would be secure against the possible attacks even if vehicles are pre - assigned with the certificates .",
    "we suggest mitigating mitm attacks by coupling out - of-(the wireless)-band verifiable attributes ( see figure  [ fig : originalmp ] ) .",
    "vehicles are authenticated using digitally signed certificates and out - of - band verifiable attributes .",
    "for example , these attributes may include visual information that can be verified by input from a camera when there exists line - of - sight including the identification of the driving license number , brand , color and texture , and even the driver s face if the owner wants to restrict the drivers that may drive the vehicle .",
    "other attributes may be verified by other sensing devices , such as a microphone for noise .",
    "the proposed protocol can be pinpointed as follows :    * initially , vehicles must preprocess a uniform cipher suite and a unique certificate from a ca . *",
    "communication starts with exchanging a digitally signed certificate that is a commitment over the certified attributes and coupled public key . *",
    "the present protocol utilizes an indirect binding over the commitment data , and the shared secret session key . * two rounds of session key negotiation",

    "* commitment data is assumed to be hashed using a collision free and second preimage resistant function . *",
    "the protocol is interactive , while enabling the mutual authentication , session key establishment and subsequent session interaction in a single protocol run . *",
    "the protocol ensures perfect forward secrecy ( protocol with improvements for fs , see section [ sect : ake ] ) .",
