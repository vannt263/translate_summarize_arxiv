    "we wish to check the model results in view of the more realistic price formation .    due to the rich variety of existing equilibrium pricing models , we have to restrict ourselves to case studies . in a previous work",

    "such an agent  based model was recently put forward and successfully tested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we briefly present its setup and adjust it to the bornholdt  kaizoji  fujiwara model .",
    "this amounts to applying the decision making part of the bornholdt ",
    "kaizoji  fujiwara model , but to then let the order book work .",
    "in particular , this lifts the constraints due to equilibrium pricing .",

    "considering their paramount success for the study of phase transitions in statistical mechanics , it is not surprising that the application of spin models , in particular those of the ising type , to financial markets has a long history , see  @xcite .",
    "bornholdt  @xcite introduced an additional coupling constant to the ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interaction which then couples the individual spins to the total magnetization .",
    "this is motivated by two conflicting economic driving forces :    1 .",
    "`` do what your neighbors do '' , by aligning your spin to your neighbors .",
    "2 .   `` do what the minority does '' , by coupling to the magnetization .    as there is no quantifiable stock price in the original version of the model  @xcite , kaizoji , bornholdt and",
    "fujiwara  @xcite extended it accordingly by setting up a stock market with two groups of traders .",
    "we refer to this version as bornholdt  kaizoji  fujiwara model .",
    "there are @xmath0 _ interacting traders _ @xmath1",
    "whose investment attitude is represented by one spin variable @xmath2 each .",
    "the dynamics of the spins is governed by a heat bath that depends on a local hamiltonian @xmath3 and determines a probability @xmath4 such that @xmath5 here , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) represents a positive ( negative ) investment attitude , meaning that trader @xmath1 buys ( sells ) the stock .",
    "the traders perception of the market is driven by two kinds of information .",
    "locally , he is only influenced by the nearest interacting traders , but globally , it will also affect him whether or not he belongs to the majority group .",
    "this is measured by the absolute value @xmath8 of the magnetization @xmath9 to accumulate wealth , the trader has to be in the majority group and the majority has to expand over the next trading period .",
    "however , if @xmath8 already has a large value , further increase is hampered .",
    "traders in the majority group then tend to switch to the minority to avert a loss . on the other hand , a trader in the minority group tends to switch to the majority in the quest for profit .",
    "altogether , the larger @xmath8 , the larger is the tendency for any group member to switch sides .",
    "the local hamiltonian @xmath10 entering eq .",
    "( [ heatbath ] ) reads @xmath11 with interaction @xmath12 for nearest neighbors @xmath13 and with @xmath14 for all other pairs @xmath13 .",
    "the global coupling constant @xmath15 is positive , @xmath16 .    how is the stock price @xmath17 determined in this model ? ",
    "a number @xmath18 of _ fundamentalist traders _ is introduced whose decisions are driven by supply and demand .",
    "they assume to have a reasonable knowledge of the fundamental value @xmath19 of the stock price .",
    "if the price @xmath17 falls below that threshold @xmath19 , the _",
    "fundamentalists _ buy the stock , otherwise they sells it .",

    "on the other hand , the _ interacting traders _",
    "excess demand is governed by the total magnetization , @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the corresponding strength parameter .    the crucial assumption in the bornholdt  kaizoji ",
    "fujiwara model is now the balance of supply and demand such that @xmath24 from this the relative price change @xmath25 after the time step from @xmath26 to @xmath27 follows according to @xmath28 with the combination of constants as given by @xmath29 here , we slightly differ from ref .",
    "@xcite where the price change is defined from the time step @xmath30 to @xmath26 with fixed @xmath31 . for the sake of simplicity",

    "fujiwara model results from a supply and demand mechnism .",
    "the authors establish a link bewteen magnetization and trading volume and give an interpretation of the aperiodic switching between bull and bear markets .",
    "they also show in a detailed analysis that their model reproduces , in an impressive fashion , stylized facts of real financial data , see ref .",
    "@xcite , such as clustered volatilities , positive cross ",
    "correlation between trading volume and volatility , powerlaw fat tails and certain similarities of the volatilities at different time scales .",
    "nevertheless , the concept of a fundamental price @xmath19 , which may be interpreted in the spirit of the `` fair price '' in the efficient market model  @xcite , raises questions .",
    "why should such a fair or fundamental price exist at all ?",
    " it is an artificial criterion applied from outside the market .",
    "is this consistent with the reality in which `` the market makes the price '' ?  the zero intelligence trading model  @xcite works without such an external concept and still produces results which are equivalent to those of the efficient market model .",
    "consequently , it is interesting to study the bornholdt  kaizoji  fujiwara model in a realistic setting by dropping the concept of the fundamental price and applying the full order book dynamics instead .",
    "put differently , we only use the decision making procedure of the bornholdt  kaizoji  fujiwara model and leave the rest to the trading via the order book .",
    "after rewieving the model setup of ref .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "3.1 , we introduce in sec .",
    "3.2 the isingtrader that is especially adjusted to the bornholdt ",
    "kaizoji  fujiwara model .",
    "agent  based models provide a useful microscopic framework for the understanding of stylized facts , even though their complexity often outrules a one  to  one assignment of input and output .",
    "there are numerous agent  based models for financial markets involving different approaches , see _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a `` minimalistic '' agent  based model was introduced that implements a double  auction order book by only resting upon absolutely essential features .",
    "it posseses a variety of traders that follow a given set of rules .",
    "the order book stores the limit orders ascending from the cheapest buy to the most expensive sell order . prices and time",
    "are discretized to the tick  size and simulation steps , respectively .",
    "orders are cleared , whenever they are marketable , _",
    "i.e. _ , whenever some buy and sell orders match . in each simulation step an arbitrary number of traders are active , the order of the trading actions is randomized .",
    "each active trader can place one order and draws his next time of action or rather his waiting time @xmath34 from an exponential distribution @xmath35 at the end of his trading action .",
    "the mean value @xmath36 is the product of the number @xmath37 of traders and a parameter @xmath38 calibrated to achieve approximately 5.4 trades per minute .",
    "this choice coincides with the average trade frequency of the top @xmath39 stocks in the s&p 500 index traded in 2007  @xcite .",
    "( to avoid confusion , we mention that the distributions denoted @xmath40 in the present study are denoted @xmath41 in ref .",
    "limit orders are placed with a lifetime @xmath42 drawn from an exponential distribution @xmath43 with mean value @xmath44 .",
    "we notice that traders of different type can choose different lifetimes @xmath42 corresponding to their governing rules .",
    "the virtual trading is carried out by the randomtrader whose buy or sell limit orders are random with normal distributed prices centered around the current best price .",
    "the order sizes @xmath45 are exponentially distributed , @xmath46 with mean value @xmath47 .",
    "short  selling is allowed and the traders have unlimited credit .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a gap structure in the order book is identified as the reason for fat tails .",
    "two mechanisms yield such gaps : canceling of older limit orders and orders placed far away from the current midpoint .",
    "the more liquidity is provided by limit orders , the less likely are extreme price shifts .",
    "the finiteness of lifetimes @xmath42 of limit orders placed by the randomtraders produces gaps , if the lifetime @xmath42 is in the range of the rate at which new orders are placed .",
    "consistent with farmer  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , price gaps between limit orders are at low liquidity even relevant close to the current midpoint .",
    "it also happens that large order volumes yield fat tails because orders far away from the midpoint are very unlikely and lead to large gaps , implying that the liquidity deep in the order book is very low .",
    "these gaps can only be reached with very large volumes which explains the observations .",
    "for very small order lifetimes @xmath42 , the number of limit orders becomes so small that the order book effectively plays a minor role .",
    "the price formation is then mainly driven by the specific behavior of the trader , in particular by the distribution used to determine the order price . to study the relevance of the order book",
    ", we should not focus on this regime .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we only consider order lifetimes which are sufficiently large , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath48 time steps .",
    "we now introduce the isingtrader as a new trader type in the agent  based model of ref .  @xcite . with the isingtrader we implement the bornholdt  kaizoji  fujiwara model apart from the concept of the fundamental price .",
    "the order book dynamics alone generates the price .",
    "we identify every lattice site in the bornholdt ",
    "kaizoji  fujiwara model as an independent isingtrader .",
    "the spin @xmath49 of every isingtrader determines , when he is active , whether he will buy or sell in the particular time step .",
    "we do not modify the mechanism that activates the traders to avoid interference with the time evolution in the agent  based model , and neither do we change the drawing of the order volumes as compared with the randomtrader , because the bornholdt ",
    "fujiwara model does not provide a corresponding appropriate rule .",
    "we also have to decide which typ of order the isingtrader places . according to the bornholdt  kaizoji  fujiwara model , we ought to derive an appropriate limit price and a lifetime to place limit orders .",
    "this , however , would be quite complicated and , importantly , not in line with our intention to abandon the concept of equilibrium pricing .",
    "the better choice is the market order , because the trader s spin value in the bornholdt ",
    "kaizoji  fujiwara model directly translates to a demand at the current point in time .",
    "this means in the framework of the agent  based model that the trader has to buy or sell the stock directly , depending on his spin value .",
    "this can only be achieved by a market order",
    ". another question arises regarding the lattice dynamics . in the agent  based model ,",
    "we wish to affect the lattice dynamics as little as possible .",
    "we have to account for the facts that , first , not every isingtrader is active in every timestep and that , second , too many market orders at one time would wipe the whole order book clean .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to couple the rate of sweeps over the spin grid to the trading dynamics in the agent  based model by a sweep probability @xmath50 .    for comparative reasons",
    ", we also introduce the liquiditytaker  @xcite who is a randomtrader placing market orders . comparing the results for isingtrader and liquiditytaker , we are able to trace statistical features back to the way how the isingtrader makes his decisions .",
    "we performed simulations with @xmath51 randomtraders with limit - order lifetimes of @xmath52 time steps , because , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , fat  tails or related stylized facts do not occur in this case . the randomtraders provide a neutral background for the trading activities of the @xmath53 isingtraders .",
    "the isingtraders parameters are set to @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 in accordance with ref .",
    "the mean value @xmath57 of the waiting time distribution  ( [ eq : waitingtime ] ) for the isingtraders only scales with the number of isingtraders , @xmath58 a good value for the sweep probability was found to be @xmath59 . to this end",
    "we looked at the price stability resembled in the ratio of limit order placing randomtraders and market order placing isingtraders .",
    "importantly , the simulations only very weakly depend on the exact value of @xmath50 .",
    "a crucial quantity is the average ratio @xmath60 of isingtraders who can place their orders before the lattice is updated for the first time .",
    "it is easily seen to be @xmath61 knowledge of @xmath60 gives a grip on the interplay between lattice and trading dynamics .",
    "this is so , because only if the lattice is updated slowly enough the simulation `` sees '' something of the lattice dynamics .",
    "altogether , these choices yield on average a trading frequency of 5.4 trades per time step .",
    "we ran 1000 simulations with @xmath62 time steps .",
    "we checked that all of them were stable far beyond the chosen time scale .    from the traded prices",
    "@xmath17 , we calculate the returns @xmath63 with return interval @xmath64 as well as the the standard deviation @xmath65 where the angular brackets indicate the sample mean over the entire trading time @xmath66 .    to study the behavior of the return distribution , we normalize the returns to zero mean and unit standard deviation , @xmath67 in fig .  [",
    "fig : results : rt_pdf ] , we compare the distributions of the normalized returns @xmath68 for six different return intervals",
    "@xmath69 to a normal distribution .",
    "we observe heavy tails which are the lower the larger the return intervals @xmath64 .    to also investigate the volatility distributions , we calculate time dependent volatilities by moving a window of @xmath70 time steps through the data .",
    "the resulting distributions for different return intervals are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : results : vol_pdf ] .",
    "they agree well with a log  normal distribution , which is consistent with empirically found volatility distributions .",
    "@xcite .    what is the effect of the isingtrader s strategy ?",
    " in fig .",
    "[ fig : results : auto_pdf ] , we compare his time autocorrelation @xmath71 for squared returns as function of a time lag @xmath72 to that of the liquiditytaker .",
    "interestingly , the isingtrader creates long ",
    "range    autocorrelation independently of the chosen return interval .",
    "a similar behavior has indeed been observed in empirical data  @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to the autocorrelation of the squared magnetization changes as observed in ref .",
    "however , in the case of small return intervals , we also observe a non zero autocorrelation for lags greater than the return interval for the liquiditytaker .",
    "this is a result of the rate of trades compared to the return interval .",
    "if the trade frequency is very low compared to the return interval , the price does not change and we obtain many successive zero returns .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : results : rt_pdf ] for @xmath73 and @xmath74 . a persistent autocorrelation of the squared returns results .",
    "we therefore find similar behavior for the liquditytaker and the isingtrader at relatively small lags .",
    "it is less pronounced and eventually disappears when the return interval increases .",
    "models for financial markets typically consist of two parts : decision making and price formation . due to",
    "the _ a priori _ limited information about the individual trader , statistical concepts have to be invoked to model the decision making .",
    "the challenge is then to capture salient features of the highly complex dynamics by stochastic ingredients . on the other hand ,",
    "the price formation is , in real stock exchanges , a microscopically well defined and deterministic process .",
    "the reason why the price formation part of most models relies on equilibrium pricing and does not involve the order book is probably twofold : first , the concept of equilibrium pricing is deeply rooted in the economics literature .",
    "second , even though the order book dynamics is microscopically well defined , it is not possible to directly map it on a simple schematic equation .",
    "hence , we find it worthwhile to critically examine the price formation part of stock market models by putting their specific decision making part in a realistic order book setting . in a previous study  @xcite",
    ", we carried out this program for a model whose decision making part is much simpler than in the bornholdt ",
    "kaizoji  fujiwara model that we investigated in the present study",
    ". the price formation part of the latter explicitly employs the concept of a `` fundamental '' price which is as questionable as the closely related concept of a `` fair '' price in the efficient market model . to model the dynamics of a system , _",
    "i.e. _ , the stock market in the present case , only quantities should enter which have some empirical justification .",
    "the `` fundamental '' price , however , is an external criterion that can not , not even indirectly , be measured .",
    "we implemented the decision making part of the bornholdt ",
    " fujiwara model in a minimalistic agent  based model and performed numerical simulations .",
    "they yield realistic stylized facts , including non ",
    "trivial features such as long  range temporal autocorrelations .",
    "this implies that the equilibrium pricing mechanism is fully obsolete .",
    "we thus conclude that the decision making part of the bornholdt ",
    "fujiwara model grasps essential features of the market dynamics in a reliable manner .",
    "furthermore , we may draw a second conclusion . in an indirect way",
    ", our study shows that the equilibrium pricing mechanism can be used to coarsely and effectively mimick the order book dynamics . put differently , the highly complex order book dynamics generates _ upon average _ a schematic rule that seems to be largely equivalent to an equilibrium pricing mechanism .",
    "contrary to the common assumption in economics , there is no need whatsoever to require that the _ individual _ trades result from such an equilibrium pricing mechanism .",
    "admittedly , we can base these statements only on the present case study , but we are tempted to believe that they are more general . nevertheless , it is not necessary to evoke the sometimes almost ideological reasoning behind the concept of equilibrium pricing .",
    "abandoning such a strict and schematic view also helps to understand turbulent market situations in which the assumption of equilibrium pricing is even less plausible than during quiet times .",
    "equilibrium pricing should at best only be seen as an averaged result of the true dynamics : everything is in the order book .",
    "we thank s.  bornholdt , t.  kaizoji and y.  fujiwara for making their preliminary studies on the spin model available to us .",
