    "the impurity f - orbital is subjected to a local on - site energy @xmath16 and local coulomb interaction @xmath13 and is hybridized with one of the s - orbitals ( here the one at the beginning of the chain ) via a hybridization matrix element @xmath19 .",
    "this maps the impurity f - orbital onto site @xmath20 and the impurity s - orbital onto site @xmath21 in this geometry , the rest of the conduction band s - electron orbitals are mapped onto sites @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the semi - infinite non interacting chain is truncated at some site @xmath24 .",
    "this decomposes the model into two clusters : an interacting cluster of variable size including the interacting impurity f - orbital and a semi - infinite chain of non interacting s - orbitals . in cpt",

    "all calculations are performed with @xmath32 and @xmath33 which yields @xmath34 .",
    "all reported results , except for the ct - qmc data in sec .",

    "a handle on dynamic single - particle correlations and expectation values is given by the single - particle green s function @xmath35 which we calculate within cluster perturbation theory ( cpt )  @xcite as well as the variational cluster approach ( vca )  @xcite .",
    "cpt and vca have been previously applied inter alia to the fermionic hubbard model and vca also with great success to bosonic systems  @xcite with broken symmetry phases .",
    "the groundwork of vca lies within cluster perturbation theory which is a cluster extension of strong coupling perturbation theory , valid to first order in the inter - cluster hopping .",

    "this tiling is done by removing the hoppings between sites connecting such clusters",
    ". therefore the matrix @xmath39 contains all single - particle terms connecting clusters ( i.e. the inter cluster hopping which will be referred to as @xmath40 below ) .",
    "the subscript  @xmath41 denotes the non interacting green s function . to apply this approach to the siam we start by splitting the physical model under consideration ( eq.([eq : hsiam ] ) ) into appropriate pieces . here",

    "this is a bit different from the usual application of cpt to translationally invariant systems which normally leads to a single cluster having discrete spectra , embedded in a superlattice .",
    "therefore the application of cpt to this problem does obviously not suffer from issues arising due to periodization prescriptions for the green s function or self - energy  @xcite .",
    "we are dealing with two fundamentally different clusters , where one has a discrete ( interacting cluster eq.([eq : cluster ] ) ) and the other a continuous spectrum ( environment eq.([eq : environment ] ) ) . due to the continuous spectrum of the environment a numerically favorable representation of the green s function of the physical system @xmath36 in terms of the lehmann representation ( see for example ref .  )",
    "is not possible . for evaluating quantities from the green s function @xmath36 one",
    "therefore has to use a direct numerical integration , which works best on the matsubara axis .",
    "+ the cluster green s function @xmath46 is determined by exact diagonalization of eq.([eq : cluster ] ) .",
    "we apply the lanczos algorithm  @xcite to find the ground state and a band lanczos method to obtain the green s function .",

    "the trace tr is short for @xmath67 , the sum is over fermionic matsubara frequencies and the small form trace tr denotes a sum over lattice sites and spin .",
    "the idea is that , due to its universality , @xmath58 $ ] ( and thus @xmath68 $ ] ) can be evaluated exactly by exploiting a different system ( so called `` reference system '' ) which differs from the physical system by single - particle terms only .",
    "this reference system @xmath69 is simpler , and thus exactly solvable .",
    "it is defined on a cluster tiling of the original lattice and has the same interaction as the original system @xmath70 .",
    "the vca reference system is chosen to be a cluster decomposition of the original lattice , as the one introduced for cpt above .",

    ", the space of allowed @xmath66 is spanned by the set of single - particle parameters of the reference system , @xmath72 .",

    "the matrix @xmath39 ( eq.([eq : dyson ] ) ) in vca contains all single - particle terms not included in the reference system ( i.e. @xmath40 ) as well as , in addition , the deviation introduced by vca , @xmath75 of the single - particle parameters of the reference system @xmath72 with respect to the ones of the original system @xmath76 . in the following we fully adopt the zero temperature formalism , in which according expressions for the grand potential and related quantities may be readily evaluated . +      in ref .",
    "we explored an alternative version of vca whereby the variational parameters @xmath72 were determined by a suitable self consistent criterion , instead of looking for the stationary point of the grand potential @xmath1 eq.([eq : stationarity ] ) .",
    "this alternative approach was introduced to treat systems out of equilibrium , although it can equally be adopted in equilibrium .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the solution of a self consistent equation is numerically easier than the search for a saddle point .",
    "the idea of this self consistent approach is to use a reference system which resembles the full system best . + the strategy is to find those values @xmath72 for the set of parameters of the reference system which let the expectation values of their corresponding single - particle operators @xmath77 coincide with those of the full system @xmath78 .",
    "here , the angle brackets denote expectation values in the cluster and the full system coupled by cpt or vca respectively .",
    "consider the on - site energies @xmath79 and @xmath80 as variational parameters .",
    "we will look for those cluster parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 which fulfill the relations @xmath81 the sum is over all non interacting sites included in the cluster .",
    "this amounts to solving a system of non - linear equations in each step of the self consistency cycle . in general",
    "it is possible to vary each single - particle parameter individually . for reasons of keeping the numerics",
    "tractable we use one @xmath80 only , which we take to be the same for each orbital in the chain .",
    "extension to a larger number of @xmath80 is straightforward . to fix this parameter",
    "we require the average particle density on the non interacting sites to fulfill the condition eq.([eq : sccond ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the condition presented in ref .",

    "the particle number expectation values in eq.([eq : sccond ] ) are replaced by hopping expectation values .",
    "again for @xmath83 we use a single variational parameter for hopping between all uncorrelated sites and fix it by requiring the mean value of hopping in the cluster and the full system to coincide .",
    "a discussion of this self consistency condition in connection with ( cluster ) dmft is given in ref .  .",
    "we use an improved multidimensional newton - raphson algorithm to find the roots of the system eq.([eq : sccond ] ) . in some parameter regions",
    "no solution is found . + a comparison between results obtained via the usual sfa , i.e. as stationary points of the grand potential @xmath1 , which we will now refer to as vca@xmath84 , to the ones obtained by the above - mentioned self consistent condition ( vca@xmath85 ) will be given in the results section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "+      in vca one can , in principle , optimize all possible single - particle parameters which are present in the original model , as well as additional ones . by adding bath sites not present in the original model ,",
    "one includes dynamical contributions to the cluster green s function  @xcite .",
    "the numerical difficulty increases with the number of variational parameters .",
    "for the vca@xmath85 case a multidimensional root finding algorithm has to be adopted . for the vca@xmath84 case , a saddle point in many dimensions has to be located . since the allowed set of variational parameters limits the search space for the self - energies one will find a solution in this restricted space only .",
    "it is therefore desirable to vary as many single - particle quantities as possible .",
    "a balance has to be found between a large space of available self energies and numerically feasible multidimensional algorithms .",
    "many works have addressed the question of which parameters are the most important to vary and how the choice of variational parameters will influence or limit the results  @xcite . as discussed in refs .",
    ", it is important to include an overall chemical potential as a variational parameter in order to preserve thermodynamic consistency . as a compromise",
    ", we will take two variational parameters @xmath86 , which cover the overall chemical potential .",
    "note that this amounts to shifting an overall on - site energy in the whole cluster plus an extra independent shift at the correlated site . for the variation of on - site energies we observe the grand potential @xmath1 to be maximal at the stationary point which is in agreement with results for other models .",
    "further parameters in the siam are the hopping @xmath6 and the hybridization @xmath19 . as discussed for example in ref .  , the variation of hopping parameters is not straightforward . for the vca@xmath87 approach ,",
    "we observe a maximum of @xmath1 at @xmath88 in the center of two symmetric stationary points .",
    "the two symmetrically lying minima are equivalent due to the fact that the self - energy is an even power of @xmath19 .",
    "as one tunes the parameters away from particle - hole symmetry this stationary point is lost in the crossover region from the kondo plateau to a doubly or unoccupied impurity ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : efscan ] ) .",
    "in this parameter region the hopping @xmath6 and hybridization @xmath19 are probably not appropriate to be used as variational parameters within vca@xmath87 .",
    "+ in the following , we always choose the set @xmath89 or @xmath90 for calculations at particle - hole symmetry , which also includes @xmath91 , since the variation of on - site energies will always yield zero deviations from the physical parameters and thus reproduce the cpt result here .",
