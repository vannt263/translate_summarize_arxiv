    "hii galaxies are characterised by prominent emission lines . in fact , they are defined as having strong h@xmath4 and oiii lines , but other ionised hydrogen ( h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , etc . ) and high excitation metallicity lines ( oii , nii , and others ) are strong too .",
    "these emission lines are driven by photoionisation of interstellar gas by hot massive stars from young stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the star forming activity in hii galaxies is so strong that it can certainly not have been maintained at its present level during a hubble time ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , they are the most extreme case of star forming galaxies , showing the highest excitation emission lines , and thus the highest ( relative ) star formation rates ( sfrs )",

    "* and others ) , nevertheless , both the high relative sfrs and the low metallicities indicate that hii galaxies are among the least evolved galaxies in existence , which assigns to them a special role as fossil record of galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "they are , therefore , ideal objects for chemical evolution studies .",
    "several authors have developed theoretical evolutionary models of dwarf irregular galaxies , of which hii galaxies are a sub - category .",
    "some of these models predict the galaxies present - day stellar - and gas metallicities , among other properties . in these models ,",
    "several chemical enrichment processes are identified .",
    "+ @xcite developed single - phased hydrodynamical models for dwarf galaxies .",
    "they model the effects of repeated supernova type ii ( snii ) explosions from starbursts on the interstellar medium , that is , the enrichment by the ejected metals on the one hand , and the gas loss by supernova winds on the other hand , taking into account the gravitational potential of their dark matter haloes .",
    "they find that , in galaxies with gas masses below @xmath7 , most of the gas is blown away , and in galaxies with masses between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , mainly the newly - formed metal - rich gas is blown away , whereas the already present , metal - poor , gas is retained .",
    "they do not calculate the final ( present - day ) metallicities of their model galaxies , but it is obvious that they remain low - metallicity , at least the ones with gas masses below @xmath9 .",
    "+ @xcite simulate izw18 , one of the lowest - metallicity galaxies known , using a single star formation burst model and a model with a doubly peaked star formation history .",
    "they use a lower snii heating efficiency than maclow et al . in their models , but include type ia supernovae ( sneia ) , for which they use a higher heating efficiency . as a consequence , alpha elements are ejected less efficiently than in maclow et al.s model , resulting in higher metallicities .",
    "the iron - peak elements , which are produced in sneia , on the other hand , are still ejected , causing high [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios .",
    "the ( gas ) metallicity in their single burst model remains very low , [ o / h@xmath10\\stackrel{_<}{_\\sim}-1.3 $ ] , depending on the galaxy mass . in their ( more likely ) double burst model , [ o / h ] can reach values up to -1 , depending on the details of the models , that is , the stellar yields used , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the time between the bursts , the duration of the second burst , the gas density and - metallicity in the star forming region , and the total mass of the stars formed in the second burst .",
    "the final metallicities of the double burst model galaxies are between 0.6 and 1 dex higher than after the first burst .",
    "+ @xcite include photoionisation and cluster wind in their two - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "they identify two mechanisms : the storage of clouds into a long - lasting ragged shell inhibiting the expansion of the thermalised wind , and the steady filtering of the shocked wind gas through channels carved within the cloud layer .",
    "they conclude that both processes must be at work in hii galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , they make no prediction about the present - day metallicity of their model galaxies .",
    "+ in a series of papers , recchi and collaborators use a new generation of chemo - dynamical models , some of which include infalling clouds .",
    "the first two , @xcite and @xcite , are aimed at reproducing the properties of two specific objects , izw18 and ngc1569 , respectively .",
    "the third one , @xcite investigates the influence of several factors , such as the cloudiness of the gas distribution , the imf slope , and stellar yields .",
    "they find that models with continuous low level star formation periods in the past followed by a quiescent phase and a recent , stronger burst best reproduce the chemical properties of the studied galaxies .",
    "they also find that , for a homogeneous gas distribution , metals get blown away by galactic winds , but cool infalling intergalactic clouds can hamper these galactic winds .",
    "the final metallicities in the their various models vary from -2.5 to -0.8 .",
    "although metallicity determinations of the various components of hii galaxies can not discriminate , how much each of these mechanisms contribute to the chemical evolution , they can quantify the metallicity at various stages of a galaxy s evolution , i.e. at the time of the formation of the old ( @xmath11 gyr ) stellar populations and at present , and thereby help to rule out some of the evolutionary scenarios , and support others .",
    "hii galaxies have the advantage that it is possible to determine independently the metallicities of the young and the old populations from their spectra .",
    "as the young populations were formed recently out of the same gas that is responsible for the emission lines , their metallicity can be assumed to be more or less the same as the one of the gas , which can be determined from the emission line strengths .",
    "the metallicity of the old populations , on the other hand , can be determined from the continuum and absorption features through population synthesis .",
    "+ the main goal of the present work is to measure the chemical enrichment in a homogeneous sample of hii galaxies , and examine possible trends with galactic properties such as total mass .",
    "this way , we can evaluate the different models and make statements on the importance of the various enrichment mechanisms .",
    "until recently , the discovery of hii galaxies was limited to the visual inspection of objective - prism surveys , introducing ill - controlled biases and selection effects ( for compilations , see * ? ? ?",
    "? * and references therein ) .",
    "+ the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) presents for the first time a comprehensive database of galactic spectra .",
    "data release 7 @xcite contains over 900000 galaxy spectra that have been selected on clear magnitude limiting criteria . in an unprecedented manner , the sdss allows to study star forming emission line galaxies based on clear and quantitative criteria , and not mere visual inspection .    in this work , we define clear emission line strength criteria to distinguish galaxies containing strongly excited gas from other emission line galaxies .",
    "we only include spectra that contain the [ oii ]  @xmath03727    emission line , as this line is indispensable for an adequate determination of the gas metallicity .",
    "this criterion excludes galaxies with redshift @xmath1 .",
    "this way , we selected a homogeneous sample of @xmath12 hii galaxy spectra of high quality from the sdss .",
    "+ in this sample , we determine the metallicities of both the gas and the old stellar content using emission line calibration and stellar population synthesis methods , respectively .",
    "it is the first time an independent metallicity determination of the gas and the stars is performed on a clearly defined hii galaxy sample .",
    "the layout of this article is the following : in sect .",
    "[ spectra ] , the catalogue of spectra analysed in this work is presented .",
    "[ method ] gives a detailed description of the method we used to analyse the spectra .",
    "subsection [ ohgas ] describes , how we determined the gas metallicity , and subsection [ fehstars ] is dedicated to the determination of the stellar metallicities .",

    "the solid line represents the observed spectrum ( rebinned to the bc03 wavelength grid ) , whereas the short - dashed line shows the best fit using the bc03 high resolution library .",
    "the shaded region between these two lines shows the area used to calculate the emission - line strength .",
    "the right panel shows the emission line after subtracting the best fit .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the shaded area between spectrum and best fit from the left panel . ]        for this work , we used spectra from the sdss data release 7 , which have a signal - to - noise of @xmath13 per pixel at @xmath14 , but usually much higher , and cover a wavelength range of 3800 to 9200   .",
    "most important of all , it contains a large number of galaxy spectra , that is around 900000 .",
    "any analysis however relies on previous clear criteria to define what hii galaxies are .",
    "first , we rejected all spectra whose wavelength ranges do not include the region from 3677    to 3775   , which is needed to measure the [ oii ]  @xmath03727    emission line strength , used in many strong line methods to determine the gas metallicity .",
    "this excludes galaxies with redshifts below 0.033 .",
    "another prerequisite for measuring this line strength is a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio in this wavelength region .",
    "we only kept spectra with @xmath153727}}\\geq 2.8 $ ] .",
    "this criterion guarantees sufficiently low noise for the entire spectral range used in this work , since at longer wavelengths , the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra is higher than around the [ oii ]  @xmath03727    line , i.e. @xmath16 in @xmath17 .",
    "+ the spectra were then corrected for galactic ( foreground ) gas extinction using the values given in the sdss database , which were derived from the @xcite reddening maps .",
    "using these extinction values and the galactic extinction law of @xcite , we dereddened the spectra .",
    "after that , we deredshifted them , and measured the emission line strengths . + in order to properly determine the emission line strengths , we first had to remove the contribution from the absorption lines of the underlying stellar populations .",
    "this was done by subtracting high resolution spectra representing the stellar continuum from the empirical spectra as illustrated in fig  [ subtraction ] .",
    "these high resolution spectra were compiled by fitting the spectra of composite stellar populations , made up of three single stellar populations ( ssps ) , a young ( @xmath18  myr ) , an intermediate - age ( 20    500  myr ) , and an old one ( 5  gyr ) , from the `` bc03 '' integrated spectral energy distribution ( ised ) library to the continua of the galaxy spectra . the `` bc03 '' library was produced using the bruzual and charlot ( 2003 ) galaxy isochrone spectral synthesis evolution library ( gissel ) code @xcite implementing the padova 1995 isochrones @xcite combined with the stelib @xcite stellar library . since it is made up of empirical high resolution spectra , the `` bc03 '' library reproduces absorption line shapes well , and is ideal for this purpose .",
    "table  [ lines ] lists all the lines we measured .",
    "+ however , incomplete coverage of the stellar parameter space and calibration uncertainties of the stelib library result in systematic errors in the overall spectral shapes . therefore the `` bc03 '' library is not a good choice for determining the properties of the stellar content from a full spectral fit . for the stellar population synthesis",
    ", we perform another fit using a different library , described in the next section ."
