    "the cosmological origin of @xmath5-ray bursts ( grbs ) is favored by many recent observations ( meegan et al . 1992 ; costa et al . 1997 ; van paradijs et al . 1997 ; bond 1997 ; fail et al .",
    "1997 ; metzger et al . 1997 ; kulkarni et al . 1998 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) . the discovery of the bright optical transient ( ot ) associated with the grb990123 ( odewahn et al",
    ". 1999a , b ) at a redshift of z=1.6 ( kelson et al .",
    "1999 ; hjorth et al . 1999 ) added another cogent piece of evidence for the cosmological distances of grbs .",
    "these results also lead to an `` energy crisis '' of about @xmath6 ergs if @xmath5-ray emission is isotropic ( kulkarni et al .",
    "it is difficult to make a model of the energy source by known mechanisms of radiation , despite the many models of the grb energy source which have been proposed ( see the references in hartmann 1996 ; piran 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the energy of grbs indicates that they are related to some kind of violent process .",
    "related to this idea , we note the galaxy host of grb990123 is highly irregular ( bloom et al . 1999 ,",
    "fruchter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this is evidence that the hosts of grbs are in a violent dynamical state , such as gravitationally collapsed halos .",
    "therefore , it would be reasonable to assume that grbs form in collapsed halos during cosmic gravitational clustering .",
    "a question is then : what are the basic properties of these halos ?",
    "namely , in what environment ( halos ) are grbs likely to form ?",
    "we will try , in this _",
    "letter _ , to approach this question cosmologically .",
    "the current situation of grbs is in some ways similar to that of qsos in the early 1970s : the mechanism of their radiation is uncertain , but they are believed to be cosmological objects .",
    "past experience tells us that the cosmological aspects of qsos can be studied even in the absence of knowledge of the radiation mechanism .",
    "for instance , the abundance , two - point correlation function , and redshift evolution of qsos has been successfully investigated in the framework of large scale structure formation ( efstathiou & rees 1988 , nusser & silk 1993 , blanchard , buchartet & klaff 1993 , bi & fang , 1997 ) . in this approach qsos were assumed to be hosted by collapsed dark matter halos of the cosmic mass field , while the radiation and other hydrodynamic processes of qsos were described by phenomenological parameters .",
    "considering that the hydrodynamic processes are local , it is reasonable to assume that the hydrodynamic conditions may not be modulated by the density inhomogeneities on scale sizes larger than the size of the halo . in this case , the probability of a halo having a qso should be the same for all halos ( fang & jing 1998 ) .    with the encouragement of the success of the cosmological approach to qsos",
    ", we introduce a phenomenological parameter @xmath0 to describe the average number of grbs hosted by a collapsed halo .",
    "consequently , the grb birthrate at redshift @xmath7 should be proportional to the birthrate of the considered collapsed halos .",
    "thus , by comparing the cosmologically predicted halos with the observed redshifts of grbs , one can find what halo environment is favored by grbs , i.e. one can find the mass and age of the halos which are likely to host grbs .",
    "the current data on cosmological properties of grbs are still poor . however",
    ", popular models of structure formation , such as the cold dark matter cosmogony , show that the redshift evolution of collapsed halos is a strong function of the parameters of the halos . in such a case ,",
    "even a few redshift data are able to constrain the models .",
    "for instance , the data of three high redshift galaxy clusters were found to effectively rule out models with high mass density ( bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the few redshift observations of grbs would also be able to provide useful constraints on the halos hosting grbs . in the next two sections , using the data on the redshifts of grb ots and the rate of grbs , we find the basic parameters of grb - hosting halos in the framework of cdm cosmogony .",
    "in the hierarchical structure formation models with gaussian initial perturbation , the comoving number density of collapsed halos in the mass range @xmath8 to @xmath9 can be calculated with the press & schechter formalism ( 1974 ) as @xmath10 where @xmath11 almost independent of cosmologies .",
    "@xmath12 is the linear theory @xmath13 mass density fluctuation in spheres of mass @xmath8 at redshift @xmath7 within a top - hat window of radius @xmath14 , and is determined by the initial density spectrum @xmath15 and normalization factor @xmath16 .",
    "we consider two popular representative cdm models - the standard cdm ( scdm ) and the flat low - density cdm ( lcdm ) .",
    "the parameters of the models ( hubble constant @xmath17 mpc@xmath18 ) , mass density @xmath19 , cosmological constant @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are taken to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the scdm and lcdm , respectively .",
    "these models provide a reasonable description of many observational properties of large scale structures of the universe .",
    "six high redshift galaxies have been found to host grbs so far . collapsed",
    "halos must be massive enough to be favored by the huge energy and violent activity of grbs .",
    "thus , we have to introduce the first parameter for the environment of grbs : the mass scale @xmath24 of grb hosting halos . from eq.(1 )",
    ", the number density of the collapsed halos formed by the era @xmath7 with mass greater than @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 because @xmath26 decreases rapidly with @xmath8 , @xmath27 is actually dominated by halos with mass @xmath28 .    in the case of objects like galaxy clusters , there is a one - to - one correspondence between an object and a halo with mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath29 ( xu , fang & wu , 1998 ; xu , fang & deng 1999 ) . obviously , the one - to - one identification is incorrect for the grb as one massive collapsed halo may host many grbs in its history",
    ". moreover , the number of grbs hosted by a halo of mass @xmath8 may be different for different halos , because the formation of a grb is not only determined by gravitational parameters of the halos , but also by hydrodynamical processes . to reduce this uncertainty , we consider that the hydrodynamical processes are local .",
    "this is , the relevant hydrodynamical conditions may not be modulated by the density inhomogeneities on scales much larger than the size of the halos considered . in this case , the average number of grbs ( @xmath0 ) hosted by a halo of mass @xmath8 does not depend on the structures larger than the halos of eq.(2 ) , and is also redshift - independent .",
    "thus , the total number of grbs hosted by halos of eq.(2 ) is @xmath30 .",
    "the birthrate of halos of mass @xmath31 at @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "a grb may not form at the same time as the birth of a collapsed halo of mass @xmath8 . in either stellar models or active galactic center models of grbs",
    ", the formation of a grb on average has to be later than the birth of its host by @xmath34 , which is the time scale of the evolution from the birth of a collapsed halo to the formation of grbs in the halo .",
    "obviously , @xmath34 is dependent on hydrodynamics , and different for different halos .",
    "however , similar to @xmath0 , @xmath34 can be treated as a parameter if we are interested only in the mean rate of the grb formations over a mass scale much larger than the grb halos themselves .",
    "thus , a halo of mass @xmath24 , formed at redshift @xmath32 , will contribute on average @xmath0 grb(s ) at epoch @xmath7 , and @xmath35 the grb birthrate at redshift @xmath7 is then @xmath36 the last term comes from the time dilation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "1 plots the birthrate @xmath39 vs. @xmath7 in models scdm and lcdm for a given @xmath40 @xmath3 m@xmath4 . for other values of @xmath24",
    ", the curves would basically be the same except for the normalization .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is taken to be 0.1 to 5 gyr .",
    "the curves in fig.1 have similar features : sharply rising at redshift @xmath41 and falling at @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the nonzero range from @xmath41 to @xmath42 is weakly affected by the redshift dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the peak of the birth rate shifts to smaller redshift for larger @xmath34 .",
    "this is expected as the larger @xmath34 means the later formation of grbs .",
    "the observational data of grb redshifts have been obtained in a couple of ways listed below with decreasing reliability : ( 1 ) derived from absorption line features in the spectrum of optical transient .",
    "it includes the measurements of @xmath43 1.6 for grb990123 ( kelson et al .",
    "1999 ; hjorth et al . 1999 ) and @xmath43 0.835 for grb970508 ( metzger et al . 1997 ) .",
    "( 2 ) derived from host galaxy , by assuming a physical association between grb and its host galaxy .",
    "it includes the redshift measurements of @xmath44 for grb970508 ( bloom et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath45 for grb980703 ( djorgovski et al . 1998 ) , @xmath46 for grb980613 ( djorgovski et al . 1999 ) , @xmath47 for grb971214 ( kulkarni et al . 1998 ) , and @xmath48 for grb970228 ( fruchter et al . 1998 ) .",
    "( 3 ) derived from a variety of objects other than ots or host galaxies .",
    "examples are grb980329 at @xmath49 ( fruchter 1999 ) , grb970828 at @xmath50 ( yoshida et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb980425 at @xmath51 ( galama et al . 1998 ) .",
    "our major conclusion is based only on the two ot redshifts .",
    "the ot redshift of grb990123 ( @xmath43 1.6 ) is further considered as the mean of redshift distribution , because it is not far away from the middle value of the five available host galaxy redshifts .",
    "the redshift @xmath43 1.6 is shown in fig 1 .",
    "this redshift is outside the birth rate curves with parameters of @xmath52 yr for scdm , and @xmath53 yr for lcdm , regardless of @xmath24 .",
    "however , if we take @xmath54 of grb971214 seriously , even @xmath55 yr curves can be excluded .",
    "these upper bounds of @xmath34 are significantly shorter than the hubble time @xmath56 at redshift @xmath57 .",
    "( @xmath56=3.1 , 5.5 gyr , respectively for scdm and lcdm ) .",
    "therefore , grbs are most likely to form in _ newly _ collapsed halos .    a generic feature of the birthrate of fig .",
    "1 is the deficiency of grbs at low redshift .",
    "the redshift range @xmath58 of each birthrate curve is generally rather narrow .",
    "@xmath59 is larger than 0.1 for @xmath60 yr . especially for the model lcdm , we have @xmath61 . therefore , if the @xmath7=0.0085 supernova really corresponds to grb980425 ( galama at al .",
    "1998 ) , the model lcdm will be in difficulty .",
    "namely , grb redshifts of @xmath62 and 0.0085 ca nt be simultaneously contained within redshift range of @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath7=0.0085 supernova - related grb probably does not belong to the same type of grbs at high redshifts in our model .",
    "the redshift distribution also supports the speculation that the soft @xmath5-ray repeaters in our galaxy are caused by neutron stars , and are different from grbs with cosmic distances ( piran 1998 ) .",
    "2 plots the birthrate @xmath39 vs. @xmath7 in models scdm and lcdm for @xmath63 and 2 gyr , respectively for scdm and lcdm .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is taken to be in the range @xmath64 - @xmath65 @xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "this figure also shows a sharply rising of the distribution at redshift @xmath41 and a sharply falling at @xmath42 .",
    "the peaks of the birth rate shift to smaller redshift for larger @xmath24 , as the larger @xmath24 formed later .    in order to fit the range of @xmath66 ( grb980703 ) and",
    "@xmath67 3 ( grb971214 ) , the mass @xmath24 of halos must be larger than @xmath68 @xmath3 m@xmath69 .",
    "halos of @xmath70 @xmath3 m@xmath69 form too early , and it is difficult for them to simultaneously cover the @xmath71 1 and @xmath71 3 for any @xmath34 . on the other hand , m@xmath72 @xmath65 @xmath3m@xmath73 halos form too late .",
    "therefore , the most likely mass range of grb halos is @xmath74 m@xmath73 .",
    "this mass range is at the lower end of masses typical of today s galaxies .",
    "therefore , these halos would be most readily identified as the progenitors of galaxies .",
    "this result is consistent with the observed hosts , as the mass of grb hosts is on the order of the mass of halos that can form galaxies by merging .",
    "it does nt mean , however , that the hosts of grbs _ must _ be galaxies , because some massive halos may not be involved in galaxy formation .",
    "for these halos grbs are not associated with galaxies .",
    "we now consider the reasonableness of the environment parameters with the observed rate of grb . from the birthrate eq.(4 ) , the all - sky , observable number per year , of gamma ray burst events at the epoch of redshift @xmath7 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the volume element in redshift space .",
    "the term @xmath77 comes from the time dilation between @xmath78 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the total number of grbs per year is @xmath79 where @xmath80 the observed grbs per unit time is then @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a factor less than 1 to describe observational efficiency of grbs , @xmath83 is the correction of angular scale if the radiation is beamed .",
    "the all - sky observed rate of grbs is approximately one per day , i.e. @xmath84yr@xmath18 .",
    "thus , one can calculate the observation - theory ratio @xmath85 , which is equal to @xmath86 .",
    "3 shows how @xmath85 depends on @xmath24 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is interesting to see that for all the considered parameter ranges of @xmath24 and @xmath34 , @xmath85 is less than , and even far less than one .",
    "because @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we have a lower bound to @xmath0 given by @xmath89 since @xmath90m@xmath4 (  2 ) and @xmath91 gyr ( scdm ) and 3 gyr ( lcdm ) , we have @xmath92 ( lcdm ) and @xmath93 ( scdm ) .",
    "there is some speculation that grbs may constitute a unique homogeneous population of sources which has few selection effect(piran 1998 ) .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath82 is not much less than 1 , then @xmath94 .",
    "although our guesses about the beaming of the @xmath5-ray emission varing from isotropic explosion @xmath95 ( e.g. iwamoto et al . 1998 ) to highly beamed radiation @xmath96 ( e.g. hartmann 1996 ) , @xmath0 is generally not larger than 1 for the majority of value of @xmath24 and @xmath34 shown in fig .",
    "our model predicts one new born massive halo can contribute no more than one grb .",
    "a possible interpretation of this result is that the grb phenomenon is related to halo merging . in the hierarchical structure formation scenario",
    ", massive halos formed from merging of less massive halos , i.e. each merging of massive halos will produce a new halo .",
    "thus , each grb halo will undergo no more than once of merging of itself .",
    "imaging of grb990123 shows that the grb is apparantly within an ongoing merger ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) .    moreover , if most grb - hosted halos merged into galaxies , each galaxy with mass @xmath97m@xmath4 formed , on average , from @xmath98 merging of @xmath68 @xmath3m@xmath4 halos ; or @xmath99 merging of @xmath65 @xmath3m@xmath4 halos . in other words , in the entire evolutionary history of galaxy formation , a galaxy on average underwent about @xmath99 - @xmath98 grb - hosted halo mergings . on the other hand ,",
    "an estimation of the mean grb number per galaxy in their evolutionary history found @xmath100 ( hartmann 1996 ) , which is consistent with our cosmological estimation .",
    "the redshift data of grb ots yield significant constraints on the massive halos hosting grbs if the popular models of cdm cosmogony are employed .",
    "we show that these data can be fitted by standard cdm models .",
    "our model predicts grbs probably to be new members of the family of high redshift objects which trace the cosmic large scale structures .",
    "we show that the halos forming grbs are newly collapsed ( @xmath60 yr ) with masses scales around @xmath2 @xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "if the current record of grbs is free of observational selection effects , the observed rate of grbs requires that each grb host halo will host no more than one grb event on average .",
    "this strongly implies a possible relation between halo mergings and grbs .",
    "these conclusions are based on our assumption of a constant harboring coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "more generally , @xmath0 may depend on the mass @xmath8 of the collapsed halo .",
    "for instance , the capacity of harbhoring grbs can be made proportional to @xmath8 ( i.e. a linear relation:@xmath101 ) . since the abundance of halos @xmath102 is a strong function of redshift around @xmath59 and @xmath103 , any weak @xmath8-dependent relation of @xmath0 will not change the conclusion about @xmath59 and @xmath103 . in this case , the constraints to @xmath8 and @xmath34 are still valid .    using the parameters of the possible grb halos , we predict the redshift distribution of grb ots , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "this redshift distribution is not sensitive to how @xmath0 depends on @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , our results will be further tested in near future when enough redshift data are accumulated to give us a reliable redshift distribution of grbs ."
