    "inelastic collisions are the process that a part of initial macroscopic energy of colliding bodies is distributed into the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "this irreversible process of head - on collisions may be characterized by the restitution coefficient which is the ratio of the normal rebound speed to the normal impact speed .",
    "although it was generally believed that the restitution coefficient is a material constant , modern experiments and simulations have revealed that the restitution coefficient decreases with the increase of impact velocity.@xcite for example , in the case of collisions between icy particles , we can easily find the monotonic decrease of the restitution coefficient against impact velocity without any flat region.@xcite the dependence of the restitution coefficient on the low impact velocity is theoretically treated by the quasistatic theory@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "kuwabara and kono performed impact experiments by the use of a pendulum of various materials to validate their theoretical prediction .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of the restitution coefficient on the high impact velocity is treated by the dimensional analysis based on plastic collisions.@xcite from the dimensional analysis , the relationship between the restitution coefficient @xmath0 and the impact velocity @xmath1 becomes @xmath2 , which coincides with experimental results by the use of a steel ball and blocks of various materials such as hard bronze and brass .",
    "@xcite we also recognize that the restitution coefficient can be less than unity for head - on collisions without any introduction of explicit dissipation , because the macroscopic inelasticities originate in the transfer of the energy from the translational mode to the internal modes such as vibrations.@xcite    although it is believed that the restitution coefficient for head - on collisions is smaller than unity , the restitution coefficient can be larger than unity in oblique collisions.@xcite for example , louge and adams observed such an anomalous impact in which the restitution coefficient is larger than unity in oblique collisions of a hard aluminum oxide sphere onto a thick elastoplastic polycarbonate plate in which the restitution coefficient increases monotonically with the increase of the magnitude of the tangent of the angle of incidence.@xcite they explained that this phenomena can be attributed to the change in rebound angle resulting from the local deformation of the contact area between the sphere and the plate , which causes the increase in the normal component of the rebound velocity against the collision plane .",
    "the present authors performed a two - dimensional impact simulation with an elastic disc and an elastic wall consisted of nonlinear spring network to reproduce the anomalous impacts .",
    "they also explained the mechanism to appear large restitution coefficient based on a simple phenomenology by taking into account the local surface deformation .",
    "@xcite    the static interaction between macroscopic granular particles is characterized by the hertzian theory@xcite of the elastic repulsive force as well as the dissipative force which is proportional to relative speed of colliding two particles .",
    "the total force acting between granular particles in contact is assumed to be a combination of the elastic repulsive force and the dissipative force in the quasistatic theory , with which many aspects of the inelastic collisions for such granular particles can be understood .",
    "this theory can reproduce the restitution coefficient as a function of the colliding speed observed in experiments and simulations.@xcite    although the repulsive interaction becomes dominant for collisions of large bodies , cohesive interactions such as van der waals force and electrostatic force play important roles for small clusters of the nanoscale.@xcite recently , brilliantov _ et al . _",
    "have developed the quasistatic theory for inelastic collisions to explain the relation between the colliding speed and the restitution coefficient for cohesive collisions.@xcite the result of an experimental result of collisions of macroscopic particles with the cohesive interaction is consistent with the theory.@xcite    for molecular dynamics simulations of small clusters , many empirical potentials are used to mimic the interaction between various atoms.@xcite among them , most commonly used one is the lennard - jones potential : @xmath3 which well approximates the interaction between inert gas atoms such as argons.@xcite here , @xmath4 is the distance between two atoms labeled by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energy constant and the characteristic diameter , respectively . in this potential ,",
    "the second term on the right hand side represents the cohesive interaction which is originated from van - der waals interaction .    dynamics of nanoclusters are extensively investigated from both scientific and technological interests .",
    "there are a lot of studies on cluster - cluster and cluster - surface collisions based on the molecular dynamics simulation.@xcite we observe variety of rebound processes in such systems caused by the competition between the attractive interaction and the repulsive interaction of two colliding bodies .",
    "binary collisions of identical clusters cause coalescence , scattering , and fragmentation depending on the cluster size and the impact energy .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , cluster - surface collisions induce soft landing , embedding , and fragmentation.@xcite the attractive interaction plays crucially important roles in such colliding processes",
    ".    however , the attractive interaction may be reduced in the case of some combinations of the two interacting objects and the relative configuration of colliding molecules  @xcite .",
    "_ carried out the molecular dynamics simulation for collisions of lennard - jones clusters onto surfaces to simulate the collision of a @xmath9 cluster onto a @xmath10 surface.@xcite they introduced a cohesive parameter to characterize the magnitude of attraction and investigate the rebound behavior of the clusters .",
    "similarly , recent papers have reported that surface - passivated si nanoclusters exhibit elastic rebounds on si surface due to the reduction of the attractive interaction between the surfaces.@xcite these results suggest that nearly repulsive collisions really exist even in small systems .    in the case of purely repulsive collisions between two identical nanoclusters , we have already reported that the relation between colliding speed and the restitution coefficient may be described by the quasi - static theory for inelastic impacts , though the restitution coefficient exceeds unity for small impact speed.@xcite in addition , on the basis of the distribution function of macroscopic energy loss during collision , we have shown that our numerical results can be approximated by the fluctuation relation for inelastic impacts.@xcite    the aim of the present paper is to study statistical properties in binary head - on collisions of identical nanoclusters .",

    "when those clusters are located by the separation @xmath152 , the surface energy per unit area @xmath153 is given by@xcite @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the hamaker constant @xmath156 with the cohesive parameter @xmath21 and the number density @xmath157 of each cluster . in our model",
    ", we use the number density becomes @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "the surface tension @xmath83 is equal to the energy per unit area to separate the two contacting plane to infinity .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath83 as @xmath160",
    "let us derive a scaling relation between the restitution coefficient and the radius of cluster .",
    "our assumption is that ( i ) the energy dissipation during a collision is originated from the sum of of the viscous force and the boussinesq force , ( ii ) energy dissipation from the boussinesq force is approximately given by the work during the detachment process of two coalesced clusters .",
    "let us first estimate the energy dissipation caused by the surface tension .",
    "a pair of colliding clusters is partially coalesced as shown in figure [ ct ] , where we assume that the deformation of two spheres are negligible , and contacted state can be characterized by a simple cut of the deformed region .",
    "let @xmath161 be the angle around the center of the upper sphere ranging from @xmath162 to @xmath163 under the assumption a small @xmath163 .        from this figure , the surface area of a cut hemi -",
    "sphere is approximately given by @xmath164 with the deformation @xmath165 .",
    "thus , the work needed to pull off two spheres is @xmath166 where we use the estimation @xmath167 on the basis of the theory of elasticity , where @xmath168 is the density.@xcite    on the other hand , the energy dissipation of repulsive spheres is given by@xcite @xmath169 where @xmath170 is time scale of the dissipation . from the combination of two terms in eqs .",
    "( [ se ] ) and ( [ e - loss ] ) , we obtain the expression of the total energy loss during a collision @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "since eq.([total - loss ] ) should be balanced with @xmath174 , we obtain @xmath175 thus , our phenomenology suggests that @xmath176 is independent of the radius of the colliding spheres .",
    "in this appendix we investigate the instability of the surface profile of clusters on the assumption that the internal modes of the cluster are expressed by those of an isotropic elastic sphere . when the shear stress can be ignored , the stress tensor @xmath177 can be written as @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the bulk modulus",
    ", @xmath180 is kronecker delta , and @xmath181 is the strain .",
    "thus , the equation of motion in the bulk becomes @xmath182 where @xmath157 is the density and @xmath183 is the effective pressure .",
    "thus , the problem can be mapped onto a problem of perfect fluid .",
    "thus , the dispersion relation is linearized equation @xmath184 can be written as @xmath185 as in the case of a liquid droplet@xcite , where @xmath18 is the index of legendre polynomial .",
    "when we introduce the gravity in this perfect fluid model , the scalar potential @xmath186 defined by @xmath187 satisfies @xmath188 where where @xmath189 is the time derivative , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 is an arbitrary function of time , @xmath192 and @xmath22 are the gravitational acceleration and the relative vertical position from the center of mass of the sphere .",
    "choosing @xmath191 satisfying @xmath193 with the surface tension @xmath83 , curvatures @xmath194 and @xmath195 , eq . ( [ eq7 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath196 where @xmath197 . to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) we have used @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 at @xmath201 .",
    "equation implies that the mode with @xmath208 is always unstable for the perturbation .",
    "thus , we conclude that an accelerated elastic sphere is unstable , which is similar to the instability of a raindrop of the perfect fluid because the neutral mode @xmath208 does not have any recovering force .",
