    "the standard model for grb afterglows assumes that relativistic material is decelerating due to interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "a shock wave is formed heating the surrounding matter to relativistic temperatures .",
    "it is assumed that both magnetic fields and accelerated electrons aqcuire an energy density which is a significant fraction of the equipartition value . in the simplest case , which will be referred to as the standard scenario ,",
    "a single value of the energy and the bulk lorentz factor is injected either as delta or as a top - hat function , of duration short respect to the afterglow .",
    "the total energy is fixed in time and equals the initial energy of the explosion .",
    "slower moving material is essential to all models which use density gradients as a means of acceleration .",
    "actually , if this is indeed the mechanism , most of the system s energy is carried by the slower material .",
    "this scenario overcomes the need for a clean environment .",
    "the fact that one now needs a substantially higher energy input can be addressed by a very energetic source such as a massive star .",
    "a similar situation exists in some cases of supernova .",
    "when a shock wave propagates through the envelope of the star arrives at the edge it accelerates , and higher and higher velocities are being imparted to a smaller fraction of the mass .    in grb afterglows ,",
    "if such slower material with significant energy is ejected , it will affect the evolution in two major ways : first , the system becomes more energetic as time passes ( refreshed shock scenario ) , therefore the temporal decay of the afterglow will be slower ( rees & 1998 ) .",
    "second , since the reverse shock will last for as long as the energy supply continues , it adds an additional long - living ( reverse ) emission component , typically at low frequencies .",
    "the emission from such a reverse shock was considered by @xcite for the discrete injection case . with accurate enough observations of the afterglow temporal decay or good spectral sampling , especially at radio to mm frequencies ,",
    "both of these features may be detected , and could therefore constrain the possibility of additional energy injection .",
    "we assume here that the source ejects a range of lorentz factors .",
    "the simplest description is that there is a certain amount of mass @xmath0 moving with a lorentz factor greater than @xmath1 , all ejected at essentially the same time ( i.e. , over a period which is much shorter than the afterglow timescales ) .",
    "the energy associated with that mass is @xmath2 .",
    "note that this is valid only for @xmath3 , were for @xmath4 the energy above any lorentz factor is constant since it is all concentrated near the highest lorentz factor .",
    "we normalize this proportionality using the initial lorentz factor , @xmath5 , and the initial energy content , which is about the `` burst '' energy @xmath6 : @xmath7 down to some value @xmath8 .",
    "this tilted top - hat injection leads to a  refreshed \" shock scenario ( @xcite ) , in contrast to the standard straight top - hat or delta function model with a mono - energetic @xmath9 and a single value @xmath10 .",
    "although @xmath5 and @xmath6 are free parameters , we have lower limits on @xmath11 to avoid pair creation during the grb itself , and we have an estimate of the initial energy @xmath6 from the energy seen in the burst . the actual value of @xmath5 can be obtained from the onset time of the afterglow or from the reverse shock initial frequency .",
    "this scenario is related to , but not identical , to the @xcite model in which a wind with near - steady @xmath12 impacts on a decelerating wall produced by the outermost shells of material which first make contact with the exterior gas .",
    "the refreshed shock or tilted top - hat scenario envisages an engine duration which is instantaneous compared to the deceleration time , whereas the latter scenario assumes that the wind duration is longer than the initial deceleration time .",
    "however if the engine produced a wind whose lorentz factor decreased with time , the net effect could be rather similar to the refreshed shock .",
    "the low lorentz factor mass will catch up with the high lorentz factor mass only when the latter has decelerated to a comparable lorentz factor . at that time",
    "the shocked material ( both reverse and forward shock ) has a lorentz factor @xmath1 satisfying @xmath13    if we assume that the outer density is @xmath14 , then we have @xmath15 using the relation @xmath16 we get @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the deceleration radius and deceleration time of the initial material with @xmath20 .",
    "note that these scalings differ from those of rees and ( 1998 ) , who obtained @xmath21 where we have @xmath22 in the scalings of expressions after our equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) . for @xmath23",
    "the energy in the slow material adds up only logarithmically and therefore the above expression degenerates to the usual ones of instantaneous injection",
    ". however , for @xmath3 where more energy is stored in a slowly moving material , we have a slower decay as more and more energy is added to the system as time evolves .",
    "note also that these expression are only valid for @xmath24 .",
    "otherwise , the shocks is accelerating ( see blandford & mckee for @xmath25 and best & sari for @xmath26)@xmath27 however , the most useful values of @xmath28 are probably the constant density case @xmath29 and the wind case @xmath30 .    since the additional slow shells catch up with the shocked material once these are with comparable lorentz factors , the reverse shock is always mildly relativistic ( rees & 1998 , kumar and piran 1999 ) .",
    "the thermal lorentz factor of the electrons is therefore roughly given by the ratio of proton to electron mass @xmath31 .",
    "in the forward shock , the thermal lorentz factor of the electrons is @xmath32 .",
    "the pressure behind the reverse shock is proportional to the density behind the reverse shock which is comparable to the density in front of it ( a mildly relativistic shock ) therefore @xmath33 as a check we can see that this is also the pressure at the forward shock which is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "the forward and reverse shock have the same bulk lorentz factor and the same pressure , while the forward shock has a temperature which is higher by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics above determine the bulk lorentz factor and the thermal lorentz factor of the electrons as function of time .",
    "to estimate the resulting synchrotron radiation , one also needs an estimate of the magnetic field . for a given magnetic field ,",
    "the spectrum consists of four power law segments separated by three break frequencies @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( sari , piran and narayan 1998 , , rees & wijers 1998 ) . adopting the standard assumption that the magnetic energy density is some fraction @xmath38 of equipartition , i.e. , proportional to the pressure , we have @xmath39 since the pressure in the reverse and forward shock is identical",
    ", the magnetic field will also be the same , if the equipartition parameter @xmath40 is the same .",
    "the difference between the forward and reverse shock lies then in the number of electrons ( which is larger by a factor of @xmath12 at the reverse shock ) and their thermal lorentz factor ( which is smaller by a factor of @xmath12 at the reverse shock ) .",
    "this result in the following general properties , valid at any given moment :    \\1 ) the peak flux of the reverse shock , at any time , is larger by a factor of @xmath1 than that of the forward shock : @xmath41    \\2 ) the typical frequency of the minimal electron in the reverse shock is smaller by a factor of @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "\\3 ) the cooling frequency of the reverse and forward shock are equal : @xmath44 .",
    "\\4 ) at sufficiently early time ( typically the first few weeks or months ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the sefl absorption frequency of the reverse shock is larger than that of the forward shock .",
    "it is larger by a factor of @xmath47 initially , when both are in fast cooling and by a factor of @xmath48 if both are in slow cooling .",
    "points one and two above agree with those of kumar and piran , calculated for the discrete case .",
    "we have here generalized the result to include the effect of the cooling frequency and self absorption frequency .",
    "the combined reverse+forward shock emission can therefore be one of three types , evolving in time in the following order :    \\a ) both reverse and forward shock are cooling fast : @xmath49 .",
    "\\b ) reverse is slow cooling , forward is fast cooling : @xmath50 .",
    "\\c ) both reverse and forward shock are in slow cooling , @xmath51 .",
    "these three spectra are presented in figure [ spectra ] . as evident from the figure ,",
    "the forward shock dominates the emission at very low and very high frequencies while the reverse shock contributes to a spectral `` bump '' at intermediate frequencies .",
    "the peak flux is that of the reverse rather than the forward shock .",
    "the combined spectrum is somehwat flatter than the usual one ( which uses the forward shock only ) . a good sampling of the spectrum , especially at low frequencies ,",
    "can therefore show the existence or non - existence of such a feature .",
    "the forward shock alway dominates above @xmath52 by a small factor of @xmath53 .",
    "since the value of @xmath54 is close to @xmath55 , the forward shock does not radiate much more than the reverse at high frequencies .    in the case of",
    "fast cooling we have ignored the effect of the ordered structure of the electron s energy behind the shock ( @xcite ) , both for the reverse and forward shock .",
    "this effect will increase the emission at frequencies below the self absoption frequency , @xmath56 , but will not change the qualitative conclusions of this paper .",
    "the spectrum displayed in figure [ spectra ] is valid at any moment if the energy and momentum injection is continuous , but also at the moment of impact in the case of the standard top - hat injection .",
    "however , in the latter case the reverse shock component will rapidly disappear as discussed by sari & piran 1999 and & rees 1999 .",
    "if the injection is discrete , the dynamics of the forward shock right after the collision will not be affected , and it will evolve as in the standard non - refreshed scenario . .    for the continuous case ,",
    "the time dependence @xmath57 of the various quantities is given in table 1 , for arbitrary parameters @xmath22 and @xmath28 , assuming a spectral shape @xmath58 . above the peak",
    "@xmath59 $ ] where the flux has the value @xmath60 the dependence @xmath61 is calculated separately for the slow and fast cooling regimes .    to give more specific numerical examples we specialize to the constant density case , where @xmath29 .",
    "we then have @xmath62 for slow cooling , @xmath63 , the spectral peak is at @xmath64 , and synchrotron self - absorption occurs at @xmath65 while for fast cooling , @xmath66 , the spectral peak is at @xmath67 and we have @xmath68    using the normalization of the peak flux and the break points , the flux can be calculated at any frequency .",
    "similar to the standard case , it is possible to test the model by comparing the temporal decay and spectral slopes .    in the standard case ( mono - energetic instantaneous injection ) , the flux above this frequency is falling with time , while the flux below this frequency is rising with time .",
    "the additional energy in the varying injection case tends to flatten the decay rate , and for high enough values of @xmath22 can even make it grow .",
    "( from equations ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) one sees that the @xmath69 factors in equations ( 5)-(13 ) are equivalent to a power of the ratio of the injected to initial energy @xmath70 )",
    ". stated differently , one would need a steeper spectral index to give rise to the same observed temporal decay in the refreshed scenario .",
    "table 2 summarizes for @xmath29 the values of the spectral index @xmath71 that can be inffered from a measured temporal decay index @xmath72 in the instantenous and refreshed scenarios , for reverse and forward shocks .",
    "it can be seen that the spectal indices that need to exmplain a @xmath73 decay that is observed in many bursts are considerably steeper .",
    "some confusion can occur between a forward moderately refreshed ( @xmath74 ) shock in the slow cooling regime and a fast cooling forward shock in the non - refreshed scenario , as these two scenarios predict similar relation between @xmath72 and @xmath71 for nominal values",
    ". however , most other regimes are considerably different from the standard instanteneous forward shock prediction even if one only has moderately accurate spectral data information .",
    "_ grb 970508_. - in the case of grb 970508 , the observations show a steep increase in the optical and x - ray fluxes between one and two days .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of a varying injection event , e.g. panaitescu , & rees 1998 , who consider the radiation of the forward shock assuming a large value of @xmath22 , a value of @xmath75 and a final energy @xmath76 . after this time",
    "the energy is constant , and the afterglow can be fitted with a standard mono - energetic afterglow , e.g. wijers & galama 1999 .",
    "how could we test the hypothesis that the `` jump '' between half a day to two days is indeed due to varying injection ?",
    "it turns out that a delayed energy injection ( if @xmath77 is the same for the reverse and forward shocks ) has a very strong prediction . we can estimate the forward shock break frequencies at @xmath78 days by extrapolating them back from those at day 12 , where the spectrum is well studied ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite )",
    "this results in @xmath79 hz , @xmath80mjy , @xmath81 ghz and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , according to the lower frame of figure [ spectra ] the reverse shock should have @xmath83ghz and @xmath84ghz .",
    "the reverse shock signature should be the largest between these two frequencies , where the flux should exceed by an order of magnitude the simple extrapolation of the forward shock model back to day two . at a more observationally accessible frequency of @xmath85ghz and",
    "@xmath86ghz the flux increase due to the reverse shock should be a factor @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively , i.e. a flux of @xmath89mjy and @xmath90mjy , respectively . unfortunately , the observations around 2 days at these frequencies where short and therefore of low sensitivity .",
    "the @xmath91 upper limit of @xmath90mjy obtained by bima is consistent with energy injection .",
    "this prediction of an additional low frequency component in grb  970508 is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "however , taking the self absorption frequency into account we have shown here that this would not apply to the usually observed radio frequencies @xmath92ghz-@xmath93ghz but to the range of @xmath94ghz-@xmath95ghz .",
    "it is therefore of great value to obtain low frequency observations or strong upper limits if such jumps in the optical and x - ray flux will be seen again in the future .",
    "if the reverse shock signature is not seen in other comparable bursts where a light curve peak is detected at a certain time ( 1.5 days in this case ) , a varying injection episode can be ruled out as an explanation for this peak ( or else , it would imply @xmath96 ) .",
    "_ grb 990123_. - in grb 990123 , a bright 9th magnitude prompt flash was seen about 60s after the trigger time ( @xcite ) , attributable to a reverse shock ( @xcite with an initial temporal decay @xmath97 , steeper than the subsequent decay @xmath98 which is attributable to the forward shock . here , an impulsive mono - energetic ( standard ) injection fits better than a tilted top - hat , since e.g a varying @xmath99 injection would predict a decay @xmath100 , while an impulsive event gives @xmath101 , in good agreement with observations for a spectral slope @xmath102 in the fast cooling regime ( the values are 2/3 and 9/8 in the adiabatic regime ) .",
    "though no spectral information was available for this burst in the first hours , a slope @xmath103 can be assumed based on our accumulated knowledge from previous afterglows .",
    "the dynamics and emission of the forward and reverse shocks is controlled by several factors , including the continuity and nature of the energy and mass input , the possible existence of external density gradients , and the strength of the magnetic fields in these regions .",
    "a contineous injection of energy with a lower lorentz factor has as its main consequence that it tends to flatten the decay slopes of the afterglow , after it has gone through the maximum .",
    "an external density gradient ( e.g. as in a wind with @xmath104 , where @xmath105 might be typical ) has the property of steepening the decay .",
    "this applies in general both to the forward and the reverse shocks .",
    "we have suggested ways in which one can attempt to discriminate between the standard straight top - hat injection of energy and momentum with a single @xmath10 and @xmath9 , which then remains constant throughout the afterglow phase , and a refreshed scenario , where the injection is also brief ( e.g. comparable to the gamma - ray burst duration and therefore instantaneous compared to the afterglow timescale ) but in which there is a varying distribution of @xmath12 and of energy during that injection , so that matter ejected with low lorentz factor cateches up with the bulk of the flow on long timescales .",
    "the afterglow energy then increases with time . under the simple assumption that both the forward and the reverse magnetic fields are equal ( @xmath106 ) a remarkable prediction is that",
    "in all regimes ( both shocks are fast cooling , reverse is slow cooling and forward shock is fast cooling or both are slow cooling ) the reverse shock spectrum joins seamlessly , or with only a very modest step @xmath107 , onto the forward shock spectrum , extending it to lower frequencies .",
    "( this could be modified if , for instance , @xmath108 , which would give a spectrum with a more pronounce through separating the reverse and forward components ) .",
    "specifically , in the case of grb 970508 , if a descrete episode of injection that produced refreshed shocks at @xmath109 days is the explanation of the step in the x - ray and optical flux at this time , then one would expect ( for equal forward and reverse @xmath40 ) an even more dramatic rise of the 20 ghz and 100ghz flux at 1.5 - 2 days .",
    "this should be about a factor of 5 and 8 , respectively , larger than expected from the forward shock values extrapolated back to 2 days . in the case of grb 990123",
    "a reverse shock appears to have been responsible for the prompt optical flash , and the decay indices ( for reasonable spectral slopes ) are compatible with monoenergetic impulsive ( or straight top - hat ) injection .    for future",
    "grb afterglow observations , the main prediction from having comparable values of @xmath40 in the forward and reverse shocks of baryon loaded fireballs is that the peak flux is found at the peak frequency of the reverse , rather than of the forward shock , i.e. at lower frequencies than typically considered .",
    "the ir , mm and radio fluxes would therefore be expected to be significantly larger than for simple ( forward shock ) standard afterglow models ( e.g. fig 1 ) .",
    "this holds whether the injection in contineous or descrete .",
    "the two contributions continue to evolve as a pair of smoothly joined components , the ratio of the two peak frequencies @xmath110 and peak fluxes @xmath111 gradually approaching each other until they coincide at the transition to the non - relativistic case @xmath112 .",
