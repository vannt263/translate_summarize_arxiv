    "in the context of tropical geometry , it is well known that two tropical curves may share an infinite number of intersection points without sharing a common component .",
    "this problem is avoided with the notion of stable intersection , @xcite . given two curves , there is a well defined set of intersection points that varies continuously under perturbations of the curves .",
    "this stable intersection has very nice properties .",

    "an alternative way of defining a finite intersection set is the following : given two tropical curves @xmath0 and @xmath1 , take two algebraic curves @xmath2 and @xmath3 projecting onto the tropical curves . then , the intersection of the two algebraic curves @xmath4 will project into the intersection of the tropical curves , @xmath5 .",
    "in general , the set @xmath6 depends on the election of the curves @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we are proving that , if the coefficients of @xmath2 , @xmath3 are generic , then the algebraic intersection will project exactly onto the stable intersection and there is a correspondence among the multiplicities of the intersection points .",
    "moreover , given two curves , we compute residually dense sufficient conditions defining these genericity conditions .",
    "the method works in any characteristic and it is essential in the generalization of the geometric construction method of @xcite to the non linear case .",
    "this also provides a particular case of bernstein - koushnirenko theorem for fields of positive characteristic . in order to prove this relationship",

    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec_notions ] , we give a brief description of the algebraic context we will work in .",
    "next , in section [ intersec_estable ] we recall the notion of stable intersection for plane curves and provide a brief discussion about its properties .",
    "then , it is introduced the notion of tropical resultant for univariate polynomials ( section [ sec_univariate ] ) and plane curves ( section [ sec_bivariate ] ) . in section [ sec_stable_int ] , we relate the stable intersection of tropical curves with the resultant of the curves and the generic preimage under the tropicalization map",

    "let @xmath41 , @xmath167 be two finite subsets of @xmath168 of cardinality at least 2 such that @xmath169 .",

    "it follows that the maximum of the piecewise affine function @xmath195 is never attained in the monomial @xmath22 alone and that @xmath22 does not induce any subdivision in the cell it is contained .",

    "first , we suppose that @xmath13 . in general",
    ", the composition of polynomials does not commute with tropicalization , because , in the algebraic case , there can be a cancellation of terms when performing the substitution that does not occur in the tropical case .",
    "recall that , by the nature of tropical operations , a cancellation of terms in the tropical development of the polynomial never happens .",
    "so , we have to check that there is never a cancellation of terms in the algebraic setting .",
    "first , it is proved that there is no cancellation of monomials when substituting the variables by polynomials without dehomogenizing .",
    "@xmath274 is homogeneous in the set of variables @xmath275 and in the set of variables @xmath215 . as the substitution is linear in the variables @xmath236 and @xmath237",
    ", @xmath276 is homogeneous in @xmath277 and @xmath237 .",
    "if we have two different terms @xmath278 , @xmath279 of @xmath280 , then there is a variable with different exponent in both terms .",

    "after the substitution , the monomials obtained by expansion of @xmath278 are homogeneous of degree @xmath282 in the set of variables @xmath284 and the monomials coming from @xmath279 are homogeneous of degree @xmath283 in the variables @xmath284 .",
    "thus , it is not possible to have a cancellation of terms and we can conclude that the homogeneous polynomial projects onto the tropical homogeneous polynomial .",
    "in the case we dehomogenize @xmath2 and @xmath3 with respect to the indices @xmath285 , @xmath286 respectively . by the homogeneous case , we can suppose that all the variables @xmath287 and @xmath288 in @xmath280 have already been substituted by the polynomials @xmath289 and @xmath290 respectively .",
    "the only possibility to have a cancellation of terms is if there are two monomials of the form @xmath291 , @xmath292 with @xmath293 and @xmath294 is a monomial in the variables @xmath236 , @xmath237 .",
    "but , as the polynomial is multihomogeneous in @xmath295 and @xmath296 , it must happen that @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "that is , the original monomials were the same .",
    "so , a cancellation of terms is not possible and the dehomogenized polynomial projects into the dehomogenized tropical polynomial .",
    "in particular , @xmath299 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath15 . in this case , it is not necessarily true that the tropicalization of the algebraic resultant is the tropical resultant .",
    "but we are going to check that the monomials where these two tropical polynomials differ do not add anything to the tropical variety @xmath300 .",

    "it happens that @xmath166 is never a extreme monomial .",

    "so , for every @xmath132 , @xmath310 .",
    "hence , the monomials of @xmath311 never add anything to the tropical variety defined by @xmath247 , because they are never greater than the monomials that appear by the extreme monomials .",
    "the other source of potential differences in the monomials is the decreasing of the tropicalization of some terms of the power @xmath312 due to some combinatorial coefficient @xmath313 divisible by @xmath17 .",
    "but , in the tropical context , it happens that @xmath314 as piecewise affine functions .",
    "the rest of the terms in the expansion do not contribute anything to the tropical variety .",
    "the only terms that may play a role are @xmath315 , @xmath316 .",
    "so , even if the tropicalization of the polynomials @xmath317 depends on the algebraic field @xmath7 , the tropical variety they define is always the same and it is the tropical variety defined by @xmath302 , including the weight of the cells .",
    "so , the previous lemma provides a notion of tropical resultant for bivariate polynomials with respect to one variable .",
    "they also prove that this polynomials define the same variety as the projection of the algebraic resultant in the generic case .",
    "our next goal is to provide a geometric meaning to the roots of the tropical resultant in terms of the stable intersection of the curves .",

    "this subdivision is essential in the definition of tropical multiplicity and stable intersection for the case of curves .",
