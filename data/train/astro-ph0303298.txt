    "recent cosmological observations suggest that there is a dark energy component to the energy density of the universe , which should be added to the matter component so as to reach the critical density .",
    "theorists have considered various possibilities for the nature of this dark energy , notably a cosmological constant and quintessence , a dynamical scalar field leading to a time - varying equation of state parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "these models most often involve a single field @xcite or , in some cases , two coupled scalar fields @xcite .",
    "other possibilities for the origin of dark energy include the generalized chaplygin gas proposal @xcite and cardassian models @xcite .    in order to unravel the nature of dark energy ,",
    "it is crucial to use observations so as to be able to discriminate among different models . in particular",
    ", the existence of a dark energy component affects the structure of the cmb power spectrum , which is particularly sensitive to the amount of dark energy at different epochs in cosmology .",
    "for instance , the locations of peaks and troughs depend crucially on the amount of dark energy today and at last scattering as well as the dark energy time - averaged equation of state , which are model - dependent quantities @xcite .",
    "hence , one can use the high precision measurements recently obtained by the boomerang @xcite , maxima-1 @xcite , archeops @xcite and , in particular , wmap @xcite observations to constrain dark energy models .",
    "this study has already been performed for the case of a cosmological constant @xcite , the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite and for some of the quintessence models that have been used in the literature , e.g. for the pure exponential potential @xcite , a `` leaping kinetic term '' model @xcite , ratra - peebles potential @xcite , a class of sugra potentials @xcite and cosine - type quintessence @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the effect of a dark energy component defined by the quintessence potential proposed in ref .",

    "( [ eq : pot ] ) leads to a model with some interesting features , namely there are two types of attractor solutions giving rise to an accelerating universe today , corresponding to permanent or transient acceleration @xcite .",
    "transient vacuum acceleration is a particularly appealing scenario that would also solve the apparent incompatibility between an eternally accelerating universe and string theory , at least in its present formulation , given that string asymptotic states are inconsistent with spacetimes that exhibit event horizons @xcite .    for both types of solutions ,",
    "there is scaling of the densities early in the expansion history , with @xmath6 in the radiation dominated era and @xmath7 in the matter dominated epoch , followed by vacuum domination and accelerated expansion .",
    "transient vacuum dominated solutions arise for @xmath8 , in which case the potential has no local minimum or , for @xmath9 , if the field @xmath10 arrives at the local minimum with enough kinetic energy to roll over the potential barrier and continue rolling down the potential .",
    "permanent vacuum domination occurs for @xmath9 , if @xmath10 gets trapped in the local potential minimum .",
    "our study of the dependence of the first three peaks and first trough locations on the potential parameters in the @xmath11 cosmological parameters space , in view of wmap s results , reveals that , for @xmath1 , the quintessence model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) is favoured as compared to the @xmath0cdm model , provided @xmath12 , which determines the average fraction of dark energy before last scattering , satisfies @xmath13 . for @xmath14 and @xmath13 ,",
    "we find the opposite _ i.e. _ @xmath0cdm is favoured as compared to quintessence .",
    "as @xmath12 increases , @xmath15 , the model s results become comparable to @xmath0cdm s , independently of @xmath16 , as should be expected since the average fraction of dark energy before last scattering becomes negligible .",
    "moreover , the model presents a non - negligible fraction of dark energy at last scattering and during structure formation , typical of early quintessence models , leading to suppressed clustering power on small length scales as suggested by wmap / cmb / large scale structure combined data @xcite .",
    "we consider a spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe containing a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant ( @xmath19 for radiation and @xmath20 for dust ) , together with a scalar ( quintessence ) field with potential given by eq .",

    "the cmb peaks arise from acoustic oscillations of the primeval plasma just before the universe becomes transparent .",

    ", there is a simple relation between the location of the @xmath29-th peak and the acoustic scale , namely @xmath30 .",
    "however , the location of the peaks is slightly shifted by driving effects and this can be compensated by parameterising the location of the @xmath29-th peak , @xmath31 , as in @xcite    _ p_m _ a ( m - _ m ) _ a ( m -|-_m )  , [ eq : lm ] where @xmath32 is the overall peak shift and @xmath33 is the relative shift of the m - th peak relative to the first .",
    "( [ eq : lm ] ) is correct also for the location of troughs if we set , for instance , @xmath34 for the first trough and @xmath35 for the second trough .",
    "although is not in general possible to derive analytically a relationship between the cosmological parameters and the peak shifts , one can use fitting formulae that describe their dependence on these parameters .",

    "notice that , as the authors of ref .",
