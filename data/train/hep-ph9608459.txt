    "this paper is the second of the two papers devoted to a study of the deep inelastic lepton scattering ( inclusive electroproduction ) on the deuteron within the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) formalism .",
    "the first paper  @xcite , presented a formal approach to the deep inelastic scattering within the bs formalism .",
    "the emphasize was on the self - consistency of the method , and the development of all aspects of the formalism so that it could be applied to a study of the realistic cases of reactions .",
    "basic analysis was performed utilizing the operator product expansion method in the leading twist approximation .",
    "subsequently , the results were obtained in the space of the moments of the structure functions .",
    "formal consistency of the approach was established and important sum rules were proven .",
    "however , all numerical estimates were performed in the `` scalar deuteron '' model which is rather far from reality . at the same time",
    ", it was stated that the following tasks have to be done in order to complete the study .",
    "first , explicit formulas for the deuteron spin - averaged and spin - dependent structure functions have to be derived , and , second , the structure functions have to be computed in a realistic meson - nucleon theory . the present paper deals with both of the tasks .",
    "utilizing the realistic bs amplitude of the deuteron , we calculate all the leading twist structure functions of the deuteron , and analyze the manifestations of the relativistic effects in these structure functions .",
    "some of the preliminary results , including solution of the bs equation with realistic @xmath3-interactions , were discussed previously  @xcite . however , this paper is not just a simple sum of results reported elsewhere , nor is it based solely on the direct application of the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but rather presents a better understanding of the formal and physical aspects of the process .",
    "it is imperative to mention now that in recent years a number of studies of the deep inelastic scattering of leptons off the deuteron have been done , referring to various manifestations of the relativistic features of the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "these studies certainly influenced our analysis during extensive studies in the time following the first publication  @xcite .",
    "next , we found it convenient to use the formalism developed in refs .",
    "@xcite in the late 1970-th ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this formalism is more convenient if we deal with the structure functions , rather than the moments of structure functions ( although it is mathematically equivalent , of course ) .",
    "indeed , the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to calculate the physical moments of the structure functions using the deuteron amplitude under the wick rotation .",
    "however , the _ numerical transform _ from the moments to the structure functions ( the inverse mellin transform ) is not a well - defined operation .",
    "the new formalism allows for numerical treatment of the `` inverse wick rotation '' of the bethe - salpeter amplitude of the deuteron for an application to the calculation of the structure functions .",
    "another new distinguishing feature of the present paper is the special accent on the systematic comparison of the relativistic and non - relativistic approaches . to do this",
    ", we consider a connection of the structure functions to the densities of appropriate charges and currents , and then analyze these densities in both relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches . in this way",
    ", we are able to trace the origins of the relativistic effects and demonstrate inconsistencies in the nonrelativistic approximations . the paper contains a number of illustrations for every step of our analysis .",
    "finally , results for the structure functions published previously have been recalculated using the new method and some of them have been corrected slightly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "anatomy ] , we define the densities of the currents which are used later in the analysis of the deep inelastic scattering . for this purpose , the realistic bs amplitude for the deuteron is presented , and the relativistic and nonrelativistic expressions for densities are defined and calculated within the realistic models . in section  [ sec : th ] the relativistic formalism of the approach to the deep inelastic scattering on the deuteron is developed , including explicit relativistic and nonrelativistic formulae for the structure functions , and the sum rules for the structure functions are analyzed . section  [ sec : num ] contains results of the calculations of the structure functions @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the realistic models , both relativistic and nonrelativistic . in section",
    "[ sec : sum ] the summary of results of the paper is presented .",
    "two appendices contain important technical details .",
    "the basis of our approach to the relativistic description of the deep inelastic scattering off the deuteron is a nucleon - nucleon bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "general self - consistency of the approach has been analysed in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "the way to construct relevant matrix elements has been shown and important sum rules have been proved , both without any reference to the particular model for the bs amplitude . a naive numerical estimate has been done within the _ scalar deuteron _ model which is found to be in a qualitative agreement with the nonrelativistic theory of the deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .    apparently , for the realistic calculations of the deuteron structure functions we need the _ realistic _ bs amplitude .",
    "the realistic bs amplitude of the deuteron is such an amplitude which provides us with a good description of bulk of the deuteron properties .",
    "this is the same ideology as it is in constructing the realistic wave function of the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the most consistent way to obtain the realistic bs amplitude is to solve dynamical problem within the _ realistic model _ of the @xmath3-interaction .",
    "the realistic @xmath3-interaction still can not be derived from the underlying fundamental theory , qcd , or its nonrelativistic approximations , such as the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "although some progress has been achieved in recent years  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the parameters of the @xmath3-interaction can be fixed from the available experimental data on nucleon - nucleon scattering ( phase shifts analysis ) , if the general form of interaction is somehow fixed .",
    "this is a traditional way of action  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the parametrization of the @xmath3-interaction is dependent on the choice of a dynamical equation . in spite of certain similarity of the sets of parameters in all realistic models",
    "there is no universal potential for all nonrelativistic and relativistic potentials .",
    "only one parametrization of the @xmath3-interaction is available for the bs equation , the parametrization of fleischer and tjon  @xcite .",
    "this parametrization is probably already due for a revision  @xcite , incorporating new data on the nucleon - nucleon phase shift analysis  @xcite .",
    "however , this parametrization has been used as the basis for our recent calculation of the bs amplitude of the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the meson parameters ( masses , coupling constants , cut - off parameters ) have been taken to be the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the coupling constant of the scalar @xmath6-meson , which has been adjusted to provide a numerical solution of the homogeneous bs equation .",
    "the chosen set of meson parameters requires some minor adjustment , in view of two circumstances .",
    "first , here we use a simplified form of the propagator of the vector mesons , omitting @xmath7-term .",
    "second , the different numerical procedures in solving the eigenvalue problem for the bs equation can also affect the value of parameters .",
    "a detailed formalism preceding the numerical solution of the bs equation for the deuteron is presented in ref .",
    "the fredholm system of `` wick rotated '' equations with all meson exchanges is solved by an iteration procedure with two dimensional gaussian integration  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "eight components of the bs amplitude of the deuteron : @xmath8 have been computed as scalar functions of two variables , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "now these components are available in the form of an analytical parametrization  @xcite .",
    "since the one - boson exchange potential  @xcite was used only with a minor adjustment , our solution does not contain new physics ( or different physics ) than the pioneering paper .",
    "all parameters are presented in table 1 .",
    "the set of parameters includes the nucleon mass , @xmath11 , the deuteron binding energy , @xmath12 , and , therefore , the deuteron mass , @xmath13 .",
    "the coupling constants are shown in accordance with our definition of the meson - nucleon form - factors : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a cut - off parameter ( see table  i ) .      in order to compare different models of the deuteron and define to",
    "what degree each of the models is _ realistic _ , it is natural to calculate various observables within these models and compare them with each other and with the experimental data . the canonical way to do",
    "this is to calculate the nucleon contributions to static observables , such as mean square radius , magnetic and quadrupole moments , etc .",
    "( the mesonic corrections are quite small and depend upon additional model assumptions . )",
    "most of the modern realistic models give quite good description of the static properties , or have a decent explanation in the case of a minor discrepancy .",
    "the observables of the reactions , such as formfactors and structure functions , are more model dependent . those are often used as a tool for discriminating between models or certain ways of using models for calculations .",
    "a direct comparison of the wave functions and amplitudes usually seems to be less meaningful .",
    "still , in many cases particular properties of the wave functions and amplitudes directly indicate what will happen when observables are calculated .",
    "a good example here is the @xmath16-wave admixture , which directly affects values of the magnetic and quadrupole moments , tensor analysing power , @xmath17 , and spin - dependent structure functions of the deuteron , @xmath2 and @xmath18 .",
    "another example , the high momentum `` tail '' of the wave function ( amplitude ) dominates in the observables for some kinematic conditions with a high momentum transfer . however , the interpretation and properties of bs amplitudes are very different from the ones of the wave functions , a direct comparison between them is impossible .",
    "recently , it has been argued that a new intuition can be developed in working with the bs amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the approach is based on dealing with the charge and current densities .",
    "the same densities also can be calculated in the nonrelativistic approach with wave functions .",
    "thus we gain a possibility to compare the models by comparing densities . besides densities are more directly linked to the observables than wave functions and amplitudes . following this guiding idea ,",
    "we calculate the charge densities which are related to the various structure functions in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the nucleon contribution to the deuteron observable , @xmath19 , in many important cases is defined by the triangle diagram ( see fig .  [ tre - dia ] ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the deuteron momentum in the rest frame , @xmath23 is the relative momentum of nucleons , @xmath24 is an appropriate operator and @xmath25 is the bethe - salpeter amplitude for the deuteron with @xmath26 being the deuteron s total angular momentum projection ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definition and conventions for @xmath25 ) . the operator @xmath27 is written in a general form , depending on nucleon momentum , @xmath28 and two external momenta , @xmath29 which does not sneak into the lower part of the diagram and @xmath30 which adds to nucleon momentum . in the present paper",
    "we consider only the case with @xmath31 .    the explicit form of operators and structure of the deuteron matrix elements relevant to the deep inelastic scattering ,",
    "were studied previously  @xcite .",
    "one of the methods to find a form of the operator for deep inelastic scattering is to adopt the wilson s operator product expansion  @xcite and use it within the effective meson nucleon theory  @xcite .",
    "other possible approach is based on a parametrization of the operators in the most general form with analysis of all structures phenomenologically or within models for quark - nucleon amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "both approaches lead to the same results in `` convolution approximation '' which assumes that the deformation of the nucleon operator off - mass - shell can be neglected .",
    "very small and strongly model dependent corrections to the convolution are qualitatively similar in both approaches . in the present paper",
    "we do not concentrate on the differences between these two approaches , i.e. our analysis is not going beyond the convolution approximation .",
    "thus , the relevant operators are vector , @xmath32 , and axial vector , @xmath33 .",
    "let us define the matrix elements of the following components of these operators : @xmath34 where notation in the l.h.s .",
    "are obvious and we use this notation in what follows .",
    "there are three main combinations of these matrix elements which are important for deep inelastic scattering and which are discussed in the present paper .",
    "they are presented below together with the correspondent structure functions of the deuteron : @xmath35 where @xmath36 means `` corresponding to '' and does not have a direct mathematical interpretation .",
    "explicit connection of these matrix elements to the structure functions will be discussed in section [ sec : th ] .",
    "the important circumstance now is that these matrix elements present charges and currents , vector and axial vector , calculated for the deuteron states with different combinations of the total angular momentum projections , @xmath26 .",
    "properties of these matrix elements , including rigorous sum rules for the charges , are used later to discuss the structure functions .",
    "let us start from the matrix elements involved in eq .",
    "( [ meun ] ) .",
    "the first term , @xmath37 , is the charge of the conserved vector current and since it is independent of @xmath26 the following sum rules can be immediately written down ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath38 obviously this sum rule is also valid in the nonrelativistic approaches , since it is just a normalization condition for both the wave functions and bs amplitudes . to make more meaningful use of this matrix element and compare our approach to other realistic approaches ,",
    "we define charge density in the bs formalism as ( see appendix [ sec : dens ] for explicit form ) : @xmath39 which in the nonrelativistic limit corresponds to the momentum density  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a nonrelativistic wave function of the deuteron ( do not confuse with the bethe - salpeter amplitude , @xmath42 ! ) with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being its @xmath45- and @xmath16-wave components .",
    "the densities , @xmath46 , calculated in three realistic models  @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ g0den ] as functions of @xmath10 .",
    "certain model differences at @xmath47  gev are present , however there is no distinguishing feature of the relativistic density .",
    "similarly , we consider other components of the vector and axial matrix elements .",
    "the relativistic densities , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc , are defined by replacing @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , etc , and taking appropriate combination of the matrix elements with different @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ nchbs ] ) .",
    "the explicit expressions for all densities in terms of components of the bs amplitude are presented in the appendix  [ sec : dens ] .",
    "the nonrelativistic densities are calculated using methods of nonrelativistic reduction  @xcite . here",
    "we present the most interesting of them .",
    "a remarkable feature of the non - relativistic densities is that they have the same angular dependences as the corresponding relativistic densities .",
    "the 3rd spatial component of the vector current in the nonrelativistic limit gives : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is polar angle of vector @xmath55 .",
    "note , this density has a suppression factor of @xmath56 , due to a mixing of upper and lower components of the dirac spinors by non - diagonal matrix @xmath51 . since the angular dependence of the explicit form of the relativistic density @xmath57 is also absorbed in the factor @xmath58 ( see appendix [ sec : dens ] ) , the integrals of both relativistic and nonrelativistic densities @xmath59 over @xmath60 are zero : @xmath61    these densities for realistic models are show in fig .",
    "[ g3den ] at @xmath62 .",
    "basically they just reflect the behavior of the charge densities from fig .",
    "[ g0den ] in accordance with the nonrelativistic formula ( [ n3nr ] ) . for illustration ,",
    "the curve representing the bs density from fig .  [ g0den ] multiplied by the factor @xmath63 is also shown ( dash - dotted ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , it barely can be distinguished from the exact @xmath64 ( solid line ) even at momenta higher than @xmath11",
    ".    two examples of spin - dependent densities : @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the legendre polynomial .",

    "the relativistic analogue of the sum rule ( [ naxnr ] ) can be used for an estimate of the `` admixture '' of the @xmath16-wave in the relativistic formalism which otherwise does not allow for probabilistic interpretation .",
    "numerically we have : @xmath71 which gives us an estimate of @xmath72 .",

    "these two examples confirm the conclusions of the previous illustrations : ( i ) realistic models are in a reasonable agreement among each other , providing description of the charge and current densities of the deuteron , and ( ii ) in spite of some model variations at high momentum , there is no distinguishing feature of the densities obtained in a relativistic bs formalism",
    ". therefore , we can not expect striking relativistic effects caused by the _ form _ of the densities .",
    "however , this conclusion does not close a possibility for effects generated by the differences in the relativistic and non - relativistic description of the deep inelastic reaction .",

    "<S> this allows for a systematic comparison between the relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations , by analysing the same densities in both approaches . </S>",
