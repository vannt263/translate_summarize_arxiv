    "lattice qcd calculation that will confront experiment .",
    "it is proposed to use analytic results for fermion determinants in qcd and qed as a check on extrapolated lattice fermion determinants . in particular ,",
    "the analytic results should be used to verify the universality hypothesis relating the continuum limits of the nave , staggered and wilson fermion determinants for a single quark flavor  @xcite :    @xmath0    or stated somewhat differently , verify that    @xmath1    it is understood that these are limits computed by taking ratios of the interacting and free determinants .",
    "checks such as these would also be useful in establishing error bounds on determinant extrapolations to the continuum .",
    "one important point should be noted : @xmath2 is renormalization scheme dependant , and so it is necessary to have compatible lattice and continuum renormalization schemes when making the above comparisons .    the analytic results , to be relevant and useful , should be free of ultraviolet and volume cutoffs .",
    "since large quark mass can be dealt with by perturbation theory , the results should be valid for all mass values or at least mass values small enough to connect with effective chiral theories . finally , the background gauge fields should be as general as possible .",
    "obviously these are severe constraints that greatly limit the available benchmark determinants . for",
    "lattice theorists such checks will require writing new code and convincing funding agencies that this is a worthwhile project .",
    "by fermion determinant we mean the ratio of determinants of the interacting and free euclidean dirac operators , @xmath3 , defined by the renormalized determinant on @xmath4 , namely    @xmath5    where    @xmath6,\\ ] ]    and @xmath7 ; @xmath8 are the second- , third- , and fourth - order contributions to the one - loop effective action defined by some consistent regularization together with a coupling constant subtraction in @xmath9 when @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is omitted when @xmath12 as well as @xmath13 when @xmath14 .",
    "the operator @xmath15 is a bounded operator on the hilbert space @xmath16 for @xmath17 , in which case it belongs to the trace ideal @xmath18 for @xmath19 @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "this means that @xmath21 in ( [ eq_02 ] ) can be expanded in terms of the discrete complex eigenvalues @xmath22 of the non - hermitian compact operator @xmath15 :    @xmath23.\\ ] ]    in qed , c - invariance and the reality of @xmath24 imply that the eigenvalues of @xmath15 appear in quartets @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; in addition , @xmath13 is absent in ( [ eq_01 ] ) .",
    "it is always assumed that @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 case raises nontrivial problems , and most of the above statements , including ( [ eq_03 ] ) , are false in this case  @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to refs . for a review of these basic results",
    ".    definition ( [ eq_01 ] ) of @xmath24 gives back what one gets using the feynman rules , and so @xmath24 is what physicists mean by a determinant .",
    "closely related to ( [ eq_01 ] ) is the schwinger proper time representation of the determinant provided it has a coupling constant renormalization subtraction included .",
    "these are to be contrasted with the zeta function definition whose field - theoretic meaning is not evident . the modified fredholm determinant",
    "( [ eq_02 ] ) in the definition of @xmath24 is necessary because the loop diagrams representing @xmath29 for @xmath30 are not defined by themselves .",
    "we have summarized this basic material because some lattice determinants in the literature , such as @xmath31 , make no sense when extrapolated to zero lattice spacing .",
    "because @xmath24 has no zeros on the real @xmath32-axis and @xmath33 , it is positive for real @xmath32 . by inspection",
    "it is an entire function of @xmath32 , and because @xmath34 , @xmath19 , it is of order @xmath35 .",
    "this means that for suitable constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 and any complex value of @xmath32 , @xmath38 both the qcd and qed determinants satisfy @xmath39 for real @xmath32 and all values of @xmath40 .",
    "defined by ( [ eq_01 ] ) and ( [ eq_02 ] ) .",
    "this is partially dealt with in refs . a continuum proof of @xmath41 with @xmath32 real for @xmath42 is needed . ]",
    "this is known as the `` diamagnetic '' bound  @xcite which can be interpreted in qed as a reflection of the paramagnetism of charged fermions in a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in these cases @xmath24 definitely does not achieve its maximal growth on the real @xmath32-axis .",
    "already at this point we have exhausted all that can generally be said so far about fermion determinants in qcd and qed .",
    "@xmath49 is euler s constant and @xmath50 is the subtraction point of the coupling constant @xmath32 .",
    "the first three terms in ( [ eq_05 ] ) were obtained by t hooft  @xcite .",
    "later , carlitz and creamer  @xcite obtained the @xmath51 term .",
    "then kwon , lee and min  @xcite verified the calculation in ref .   and also obtained the remaining terms of order @xmath52 .",
    "note that the coefficient of the leading @xmath53 term , @xmath54 , is the chiral anomaly in this case , which should be of special interest in extrapolations of lattice calculations of the instanton determinant .",
    "recently , dunne , hur , lee and min  @xcite have proposed a partial - wave wkb phaseshift method for calculating the instanton determinant for all values of @xmath55 .",
    "although their predicted value for @xmath56 is @xmath57 to third order in the wkb approximation , inclusion of higher order terms may improve this result .",
    "if so this would raise the question of why the wkb analysis should work for other than large values of @xmath55 .    the inclusion of the subscript @xmath58 on the determinant in ( [ eq_05 ] ) is provisional because it was not calculated following ( [ eq_01 ] ) and ( [ eq_02 ] ) .",
    "instead , the @xmath59 term in ( [ eq_05 ] ) was obtained using pauli - villars regulator fields[multiblock footnote omitted ] with space - time dependent masses followed by a change in the subtraction point to the constant mass @xmath50 in ( [ eq_05 ] )",
    ". it would be reassuring if the instanton determinant were recalculated for @xmath27 using ( [ eq_01 ] ) and ( [ eq_02 ] ) or the schwinger proper time representation without space - time dependant masses and verify that the @xmath59 term emerges when @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to generalise the first two terms in ( [ eq_05 ] ) to any square - integrable self - dual background gauge field with range @xmath45 interacting with a massive fermion . referring to eqs .",
    "( 3.5 ) and ( 3.10 ) in ref .",
    "one sees by inspection that for @xmath61 and @xmath62            the second analytic result available is the fermion determinant in @xmath70 for the background field @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath74 is arbitrary except that @xmath75 with continuous first and second derivatives and @xmath76 for @xmath77 with @xmath78 . in polar coordinates , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the total flux of @xmath74 out to @xmath82 .",
    "hence @xmath83 , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is @xmath74 s total flux .",
    "then for the sequence of limits indicated we obtain the following result  @xcite :      the minus sign is in accord with the diamagnetic bound cited in sec .",
    "[ sec_02 ] , and the coefficient of the @xmath87 term , @xmath88 , is the two - dimensional chiral anomaly , assuming @xmath89 . the analysis in ref . is not sufficient to rule out the @xmath90 term in the remainder in ( [ eq_09 ] ) ; it may only be @xmath91 .",
    "this result is therefore valid for a whole class of background gauge fields in the nonperturbative region of small mass and strong coupling .",
    "note that the @xmath9 term in ( [ eq_01 ] ) is cancelled by @xmath92 in ( [ eq_01 ] ) and ( [ eq_02 ] ) .",
    "we believe this is a general result and that @xmath11 will be cancelled by @xmath93 in @xmath94 .",
    "finally , although result ( [ eq_09 ] ) is for an abelian background field in @xmath14 it remains a challenge for lattice qcd fermion determinant algorithms  which we take to include the discretization of the dirac operator adopted  to reproduce it .",
