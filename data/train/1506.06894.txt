    "simulating a quantum system with a classical computer seems to be an unfeasible task due to the exponential growths of the dimension of the hilbert space as a function of the number of considered systems .",
    "this is why the classical simulation of quantum behavior is usually restricted to a few qubits , although the numerical methods became very powerful .",
    "however , as pointed out be feynman @xcite and proven by lloyd @xcite quantum systems can be used to simulate the behavior of the other .",
    "the former being such that constituents can be very precisely prepared , manipulated and measured .",
    "many experiments are realizing such a simulation nowadays . among them",

    ", we are using the fact that some classes of quantum algorithms , among them those which are based on matchgates , can be simulated classically efficiently .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that matchgate circuits can also be simulated by an exponentially smaller quantum computer @xcite . there , the classical computation is restricted in space such that the computation has to be performed by the quantum computer and can not be performed by the classical computer .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the computational power of matchgate circuits running on @xmath0 qubits is equivalent to the one of space - bounded quantum computation with space restricted to being logarithmic in @xmath0 @xcite .    as demonstrated in @xcite this compressed way of quantum computation",

    "such a set  up can be used to simulate certain interactions of @xmath2 qubits . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated how the adiabatic evolution of the 1d ising and more generally the xy - model can be simulated via an exponentially smaller quantum system .",
    "more precisely , it is shown there , how the phase transition of such a model of a spin chain consisting out of @xmath0 qubits can be observed via a compressed algorithm processing only @xmath1 qubits .",
    "the feasibility of such a compressed quantum simulation is due to the fact that the adiabatic evolution and the measurement of the magnetization employed to observe the phase transition can be described by a matchgate circuit .",
    "remarkably , the number of elementary gates , i.e. the number of single and two-qubit gates which are required to implement the compressed simulation can be even smaller than required to implement the original matchgate circuit .",
    "this compressed algorithm has already been experimentally realized using nmr quantum computing @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed that not only the quantum phase transition can be observed in this way , but that various other interesting processes , such as quantum quenching , where the evolution is non  adiabatic , and general time evolutions can be simulated with an exponentially smaller system .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the notion of compressed quantum simulation even further .",
    "we will consider the xy - model and derive compressed circuits to simulate the behavior of the thermal and any excited state of the system . to this end , we use the diagonalization of the xy  hamiltonian presented in @xcite .",
    "there , the unitary , which diagonalizes the xy  hamiltonian has been derived and decomposed into matchgates .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that this unitary can be utilized to generate the thermal and any excited state of the system from a product state .",
    "we use these results to derive compressed circuit which simulate the corresponding matchgate circuits .",
    "they can then be used to measure for instance the magnetization of any thermal or excited state of the system using exponentially fewer qubits .",
    "apart from that , we also show that the number of elementary gates will be smaller in the compressed simulation than the direct simulation .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is the following .",
    "first , we will recall the definition of matchgates and review how compressed quantum computation can be achieved . moreover",
    ", we will recall some basic properties of the xy - model and its exact diagonalization . in sec .",

    "[ sect.compressed ] we derive then the compressed circuit corresponding to @xmath3 .",
    "we will show that the number of elementary gates required for any of those simulations can be even smaller in the compressed simulation than the original one . using this circuit",
