    "one possible approach to study the chaotic properties of bounded time - independent quantum system is based on results of the random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "bohigas , giannoni and schmit @xcite conjectured that the local fluctuations of quantum energy levels of such systems display universal properties .",
    "following this conjecture the level spacing distribution of integrable systems with more than one degree of freedom is expected to be poissonian , while the distribution for systems that are classically chaotic is described by the random matrix theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( integrability in the quantum case means that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system can be evaluated by solving a simple algebraic equation . )",
    "the specific distribution depends in this case on the symmetry of the system and is described by the gaussian orthogonal , unitary or symplectic ensemble respectively .",
    "nowadays there is an impressive amount of evidence for the relevance of this conjecture and so for the link between the random matrix theory and the quantum behaviour of classically chaotic systems .",
    "the assumption about the number of degrees of freedom is , however , quite important since the conjecture does nt hold in one dimension . all classical time independent one dimensional systems",
    "are integrable .",
    "nevertheless there are quasi one - dimensional quantum systems ( the quantum graphs ) that display random matrix properties .",
    "recent papers give a wide theoretical and experimental evidence for such behaviour in various interconnected quantum graphs @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamic is here related to the nontrivial topological structure of the graph and the random matrix description of the spectral statistics of the quantum graph is based on this fact .",
    "quantum graphs are topologically nontrivial since each node is connected with at least three neighbors .",
    "this is why these systems are regarded as quasi one dimensional . in a very one dimensional system",
    "each point is topologically related only to its two neighbors : to the one on its right and to the one on its left .",
    "our aim here is to construct a virtually one dimensional system ( i.e. each node has only 2 neighbors ) displaying a random matrix behavior .",
    "the work is based on the paper @xcite .",
    "however there is a great difference in results .",
    "we focus on the weak coupling limit and show that in this case , the level - spacing spectral statistic display two fundamentally different types of behavior .",
    "the statistical properties of the odd level spacings are described by the random matrix theory while the even spacings do not show this behavior .",
    "we deal with a one dimensional particle on a circle with scale free point interactions localized at the points @xmath1 .",
    "the scale free point interaction ( @xcite ) localized at the origin is described by a one parameter family of boundary conditions : @xmath2 it has the amazing property that the corresponding reflection / transmission coefficients do not depend on the particle energy . the scale free point interaction is also expressible as a limit of short - range potentials , see @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is represented by the one dimensional laplace operator @xmath3 with a set of boundary conditions : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a parameter .",
    "we denote the domain of @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions define a circle .",
    "the second pair describes the point interactions .",
    "it can be easily shown ( see the theory of self adjoint extensions e.g.@xcite ) that the operator @xmath6 is self adjoint for every @xmath8 . moreover ,",
    "its spectrum is purely discrete containing eigenvalues of finite multiplicity without limit points .",
    "note that for @xmath9 the hamiltonian describes simply a free particle on a circle .",
    "furthermore in the limits @xmath10 the system decouples into @xmath0 independent subsystems with the dirichlet boundary condition on one side and the neumann condition on the other side of the subintervals @xmath11 .",
    "in what follows we will focus on the positive part of the spectrum denoting @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "an eigenvector @xmath14 corresponding to the energy @xmath15 writes on the subinterval @xmath16 as @xmath17 with some coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the vector @xmath20 belongs to the domain @xmath7 if it satisfies the boundary conditions and .",
    "this leads to a relation between the neighboring coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 for each @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being a 2x2 matrix : @xmath26 the dependence between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is given by the periodic boundary conditions ( [ 1kruz ] ) and leads to a relation @xmath29 with matrix @xmath30 combining all these relations together we obtain that the coefficients @xmath28 determine an eigenvector of @xmath6 iff @xmath31 so the eigenvalues of @xmath6 are obtained as solutions of the equation @xmath32    since the matrices in the above determinant are of size @xmath33 , we can easily determine the explicit form of from and by induction .",
    "the secular equation becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 note that ( [ zetap ] ) is a finite series and it ends when the number of indices in the last sum reaches the highest even number @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "so the last term is @xmath38    since the equation contains only even powers of @xmath39 the positive spectrum of @xmath6 is invariant under the replacement @xmath40 ( it leads to the change @xmath41 ) .    in the free case ( @xmath42 ) the equation simplifies to @xmath43 and the solutions are just @xmath44 with the eigenvalues being doubly degenerate ( a consequence of the rotational symmetry of the system ) .",
    "we start with the free case omitting its non degenerate ground state .",
    "further we suppose that all the points @xmath45 are rationally independent , i.e. we suppose that the equation @xmath46 has a solution only for @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .    the states are two times degenerate . since we want to compare the fluctuation properties of the energy levels with the random matrix theory we will not work directly with the eigenvalues @xmath49 but with the values @xmath50 .",
    "the point is that the values @xmath51 have not to be unfolded and are of density 1 . from now on whenever we deal with the level spacing statistics we have the `` spectrum '' @xmath51 in mind .",
    "the free case is trivial : @xmath52 . defining the level spacing",
    "@xmath53 we immediately see that the probability density @xmath54 consists simply of two delta peaks @xmath55 .",
    "the peak at @xmath56 comes from the degeneracy of the eigenvalues .",
    "the question is what happens in the case @xmath57 , i.e. when the point interactions are switched on .",
    "the degeneracy vanishes and the two delta peaks turn into smooth distributions .    to see what happens in that case",
    "let us assume a small change of the parameter @xmath8 : @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the relation leads to @xmath60    so the secular equation can be solved perturbatively supposing the roots @xmath61 in the form @xmath62 with @xmath63 . substituting it into the equation ( ) and using the properties of goniometric functions we get",
    "@xmath64 the absolute term drops out and we get ( in the order of @xmath65 ) @xmath66 the solutions @xmath67 are given by @xmath68    the degenerate eigenvalues split and become @xmath69 so the unfolded level spacings are @xmath70 the odd spacings @xmath71 contribute to the widening of the @xmath72 peak localized at @xmath56 while the even spacings @xmath73 broaden the @xmath74 peak localized at 2 .",
    "we will now show that the peak at 0 is not only broaden but it acquires a shape prescribed by the random matrix theory .    the positions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are altogether rationally independent .",
    "hence @xmath77 are also rationally independent irrational numbers .",
    "the periodicity of cosine leads to the relation @xmath78 where mod means the remainder after integer division .",
    "from the theory of distribution of sequences modulo one ( see @xcite ) we know that when @xmath79 changes the arguments of cosines and sines in behave like independent random variables uniformly distributed in @xmath80 . from this fact",
    "follows that the distribution of the sequence @xmath81 has a probability density function @xmath82 moreover for different positions @xmath83 , @xmath84 these sequences behave like independent random variables .",
    "the same holds for @xmath85 .",
    "so the sums @xmath86 , @xmath87 normalized by the factor @xmath88 converge with increasing @xmath0 to two normally distributed random variables .",
    "in fact there two variables are _ statistically independent .",
    "to see this we sketch the proof of this fact .",
    "it is based on the observation that the pair @xmath89 , with @xmath90 being uniformly distributed along @xmath91 , can be equivalently represented in the form @xmath92 as one can easily prove , random variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 are stochastically independent .",
    "so the statistical dependence of the cosine and sine is fully contained in their absolute values , while their signs are statistically independent .",
    "this observation together with the characteristic function technique used in the standard proof of the central limit theorem shows finally the statistical independence of the above sums . _    summarizing we see that in the weak perturbation limit the distribution of the odd spacings @xmath71 is given by a square root of a sum of squares of two independent and normally distributed random variables .",
    "properly normalized it is nothing but the wigner distribution @xmath95 approximating the spacing distribution @xmath96 of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices ( goe ) : @xmath97    remember that during the limiting procedure the perturbation condition @xmath63 has to be fulfilled for every @xmath0 . together with the structure of the formula ( [ lambdapmj ] ) it leads to a condition @xmath98 .",
    "since the exact wigner distribution is obtained in the limit @xmath99 the parameter @xmath39 has to decrease to @xmath56 .",
    "it is an open question how this distribution behaves for increasing @xmath0 and fixed @xmath39 .",
    "we suppose that for fixed @xmath39 the difference to the wigner distribution first decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "than , for some value of @xmath0 , it reaches a minimum and starts to increase when @xmath0 violates the condition @xmath98 .",
    "the even spacings @xmath73 behave differently .",
    "substracting the constant 2 the relation contains a sum of two variables with a wigner distribution .",
    "so the spacing probability density behaves as @xmath100 for small @xmath101 and hence in a way that is not related to the random matrix theory .",
    "the next section shows that the distribution of the odd spacings follows the random matrix prediction even in the non perturbative regime .",
    "the topology of the system ( a circle ) is of fundamental importance . to show this we investigate an analogous system on a line segment .",
    "all the parameters of the system remain unchanged .",
    "the only difference is that the periodic boundary conditions ( [ 1kruz ] ) are replaced by the dirichlet ones : @xmath102 .",
    "the spectrum is again purely discrete and the eigenvalues are determined by the roots of the secular equation @xmath103 the free case ( @xmath104 ) leads to unfolded energies @xmath105 and the probability density @xmath54 of the level spacings @xmath53 is just @xmath106 .    for weak",
    "coupling one applies the perturbation methods . with the assumption @xmath107 the result",
    "is given by @xmath108 the distribution of @xmath109 tends ( after rescaling by the factor @xmath110 ) to a normal distribution with zero mean as @xmath111 .",
    "so the unfolded level spacings , @xmath112 , are in the weak coupling limit normally distributed and not related to the random matrix theory .",
    "we solved the equation ( [ chareqkruz ] ) finding its first @xmath113 roots for different values of @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "the interaction positions have been chosen as @xmath114 with @xmath115 denoting the @xmath116th prime number .",
    "this choice is obviously rationally independent and @xmath117 holds .",
    "the presented results are , however , not influenced by this particular choice .",
    "for different positions satisfying @xmath117 the results remain unchanged .    in the perturbative regime",
    "the odd spacings follow the wigner distribution whereas the even spacings not .",
    "interestingly enough the spacing statistics behave similarly also beyond the weak coupling limit .        as an approximation of the exact distribution @xmath96 we used the taylor expansion up to the power 42 for small spacings and the dyson asymptotic result otherwise .",
    "this approach is described in @xcite chapter 4.9 .",
    "it leads to a difference between the wigner surmise and the goe result : @xmath122    the distribution @xmath123 of the odd level spacings @xmath124 is defined in a usual way , @xmath125 with @xmath126 being the heaviside step function and @xmath127 the number of spacings taken into account .",
    "its derivative ( in the limit @xmath128 ) is the level spacing density .",
    "a typical result is shown on the figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the solid line marks the wigner probability density , .",
    "stars show the a the level - spacing probability density for goe as published in @xcite , table a.15 .",
    "it is not a surprise that for the weak coupling @xmath135 the sequence @xmath71 follows the wigner distribution more closely than mehta - gaudin ( goe ) distribution .",
    "this is just the consequence of the arguments presented in the previous section .",
    "it remains true , however , also for @xmath8 up to @xmath136 i.e. far outside the weak coupling limit .",
    "even more : there is a distinct minimum of @xmath132 for @xmath137 . with increasing @xmath8",
    "the distribution starts , however , approach closer the goe result then its wigner approximation . for @xmath138 the difference @xmath139 displays a clear minimum with @xmath140 . for this coupling the spacing distribution of the model very close to the true goe statistic . for @xmath141 the agreement however deteriorates step by step",
    "this is understandable since the system with many non - periodically placed interactions is influenced by localization effects for strong enough coupling .",
    "for @xmath142 the spectrum becomes a sum of @xmath0 mutually embedded equidistant sequences and becomes poissonian for rationally independent points @xmath143 - see @xcite .",
    "the level spacing statistic depends only on the neighbouring levels .",
    "more sensitive statistical properties , like for instance the number variance , describe the correlation of larger level sets . in our case ,",
    "such large correlations are dominated by the simple geometric structure of the model and by the related periodic orbits ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this leads finally to oscillatory pattern like the one observed in the number variance and plotted on the figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "evaluated for 24 point interactions with @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the solid and dashed curves correspond to the predictions for the gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) and the gaussian unitary ( gue ) ensembles respectively.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the spectral properties of the model are closely related to its topology .",
    "remember that the odd spacings originate from the splitting of the two times degenerate eigenvalues for the free case and are in such a way linked to the fact that the system has a topology of a circle .",
    "if we change the topology and replace the periodic boundary condition ( [ 1kruz ] ) with the dirichlet ones @xmath102 ( i.e. we work on a line segment instead of on a circle ) the spacing distribution changes fundamentally and never follows the random matrix theory .",
    "in this case the distribution of all spacings ( odd and even ) is the same .",
    "their common distribution is displayed on the figure [ linefig ] .",
    "to summarize : we have discussed a simple one dimensional quantum model that displays a level spacing statistics being in a surprising agreement with the predictions of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices .",
    "we show that this agreement is related to the topology of the system ( circle ) and vanishes when the topology is changed ( circle is replaced by a line segment ) .",
