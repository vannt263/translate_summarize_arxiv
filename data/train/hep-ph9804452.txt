    "mesons in which the gluons are in an excited state have been discussed for some time .",
    "there are two main pictures that have evolved for treating these excited states .",
    "the first is the constituent gluon approach where the quarks and a gluon move in an mit bag @xcite or a potential model @xcite . the second picture envisions the quarks to be connected by a string or flux tube @xcite which has quantized transverse vibrations . in this case the flux tube can be thought of as a coherent gluonic state . in all of these models",
    "the resulting meson is analogous to the diatomic molecule where the gluonic degrees of freedom are the `` electronic state '' that can assume many levels of excitation .",
    "each excited state yields an interaction energy that acts as an adiabatic potential in which the quarks or `` ions '' move .",
    "the ground state of the glue corresponds to standard meson states and the excited glue to `` hybrid meson '' states .",
    "recently the excited glue states with fixed end points have been investigated in detail by lattice simulation @xcite .",
    "these calculations are done with an improved action in the quenched approximation for a variety of gluonic operators , and on several anisotropic lattices .",
    "it is our purpose here to point out that the systematics of the gluon states are extremely simple from the vibrating relativistic flux tube point of view . to a remarkable extent",
    "the gluon states group themselves into a few highly degenerate states at large quark separations , reflecting the well known degeneracy of the quantized two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "we further show that , given the ground state potential , the hybrid adiabatic potentials are uniquely predicted and agree well with the lattice results .",
    "our calculation is fully relativistic and does not introduce arbitrary procedures as required by previous work @xcite .",
    "it is a common misconception that a free relativistic string _ must _ be formulated in twenty six dimensions in order to be consistently quantized . in fact",
    ", quantized theories of a single non - interacting relativistic string can be defined consistently in any spacetime dimension smaller than twenty six using the standard string theoretic methods .",
    "long ago , brower and goddard and thorn @xcite showed that free bosonic string theories in spacetime dimensions @xmath0 are free of ghost ( negative norm ) states as long as the first excited state is not tachyonic .",
    "subsequently rohrlich @xcite found an oscillator quantization of the non - interacting relativistic string that is manifestly free of ghosts in any dimension , while polyakov @xcite quantized the string as a sum over random surfaces that is consistent in dimensions twenty - six or smaller .",
    "it is only in the context of dual models and their superstring offspring that the theory becomes consistent in a single ( critical ) dimension .",
    "this is because unphysical states that may be consistently eliminated from a free string can not be consistently eliminated from an interacting string theory @xcite .",
    "the nambu - goto action , with fixed end boundary conditions may be quantized consistently in @xmath1 using the gupta - bleuler method in the temporal gauge , @xmath2 .",
    "the energy of a string of tension @xmath3 and distance @xmath4 between the fixed ends , @xmath5 follows from the zero mode of the virasoro constraint @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath6 labels the mode level which is occupied by @xmath7 phonons of positive helicity and @xmath8 phonons of negative helicity .",
    "the constant @xmath9 is an arbitrary normal ordering constant subject only to the constraint , @xmath10 , of the no - ghost theorem .    in the temporal gauge ,",
    "lorentz invariance does not impose any restriction on spacetime dimension @xmath11 @xcite as it does in light - cone gauge and only requires that @xmath9 be chosen such that the system has a rest frame .",
    "this formally infinite constant is often calculated @xcite by summing the casimir zero - point energies using zeta function regularization , yielding the value @xmath12 .",
    "the standard brst quantization method also yields the values @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the gupta - bleuler method we use here yields a consistent quantum theory of a single string for any value of @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that different methods of quantizing theories with constraints , such as the nambu - goto string , need not be equivalent and may differ in their energy spectra as well as in their dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the excited glue states are completely specified by the separation between the ends and the occupation number of each of the modes , @xmath16 states with @xmath17 are denoted @xmath18 .",
    "the second label is the cp value of the glue which appears as either a subscript @xmath19 or @xmath20 depending on whether cp is even or odd respectively .",
    "the @xmath21 states ( @xmath22 ) are labeled additionally by a superscript @xmath23 denoting their parity under reflection through a plane in which the axis lies .",
    "the cp value of the flux tube is determined by @xcite @xmath24 in the vibrating flux tube model the @xmath25 and @xmath26 states are always degenerate as well .    for @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "the glue states are uniquely @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "for @xmath31 the flux tube can be excited in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 states .",
    "for an arbitrary @xmath35 , states with @xmath36 can be excited .",
    "this degeneracy is a firm prediction of the flux tube picture and is expected to hold for large @xmath37 separations .",
    "in this section we compare the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) for flux tube vibrations with the results of a lattice simulation of quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "the lattice energies are given relative to the ground state ( @xmath29 ) energy at a quark separation of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a hadronic scale distance determined @xcite from the @xmath29 data at large @xmath4 .    the ground state ( @xmath29 ) potential from eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) with @xmath27 , together with a short distance @xmath37 color singlet potential @xmath40 and an additive constant , gives @xmath41 the existence of a potential for all values of @xmath4 requires @xmath9 non - negative . if @xmath42 , the `` cornell '' potential is recovered , @xmath43 the best fit of eq .",
    "( [ groundpotential ] ) to the lattice data occurs in fact where @xmath42 . assuming this , we obtain for the best representation of @xmath29 @xmath44 once the above values have been fixed by the ground state lattice data , all of the excited states are predicted uniquely , with @xmath45    the gluonic excitation energies obtained by lattice simulation are shown in figs .",
    "13 in molecular notation . in fig .  1 the @xmath46 states @xmath47 are plotted .",
    "the lowest @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) states are displayed in figs .  2 and 3 respectively .",
    "for @xmath52 , the @xmath53 and @xmath54 states are degenerate .    in the figures we also show the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 predictions superimposed upon the @xmath21 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 lattice data @xcite .",
    "we observe general agreement at large @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 states follow the vibrating string prediction even down to small @xmath37 separations .",
    "the @xmath26 states do not closely resemble either the @xmath31 or @xmath57 curves .",
    "one possible explanation is that they have admixtures of higher @xmath60 excitations .    because the flux tube may be viewed as a coherent gluonic state",
    ", one might expect that for small quark separation it should continue smoothly to the perturbative configuration of one gluon and a @xmath37 color octet .",
    "we test this assumption by modifying the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ highern ] ) by adding to the excited potentials a color octet short distance repulsion , @xmath61 where @xmath62 was determined ( [ rnaught ] ) by the short distance color singlet attraction of the @xmath29 ground state .",
    "our results ( dashed curves ) indicate that this short range behavior seems to improve most of the predictions , if only marginally .",
    "relativistic vibrating string models have been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "some authors maintain that a tachyonic ground state ( @xmath63 ) is required in fewer than 26 dimensions @xcite .",
    "others maintain that there are quantization ambiguities that allow , at least for a non - interacting string , consistent quantization in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "we advocate the later interpretation and show that the vibrating ( phonon ) excitations closely correspond to a lattice simulation of qcd .",
    "the success of this simple flux tube picture strongly supports the string vibration modes as being the correct low energy degrees of freedom for the gluonic excitations in hybrid mesons . the original work of isgur and paton @xcite has the same large @xmath4 limit as our result but is intrinsically non - relativistic .",
    "since waves propagate with the speed of light on a flux tube , a relativistic model is mandated .",
    "furthermore , the isgur - paton model introduces an arbitrary radial functional dependence to avoid unphysical behavior at @xmath64 . in this function a free parameter can be tuned so that the potential has zero slope at @xmath64 for the @xmath65 state . for larger @xmath60 the intercept rises as required , but now the slope becomes progressively more negative .",
    "this effect is demonstrated numerically in @xcite .",
    "our model predicts a unique potential for the excited states once the parameters are determined by the ground state .",
