    "differential flatness , roughly speaking , means that all the variables of an under - determined system of ordinary differential equations can be expressed as functions of a particular output , called flat output , and a finite number of its successive time derivatives ( @xcite , see also @xcite and the references therein ) .    for time - delay systems and more general classes of infinite - dimensional systems , extensions of this concept",
    "have been proposed and thoroughly discussed in @xcite . in a linear context ,",
    "relations with the notion of system parameterization @xcite and , in the behavioral approach of @xcite , with _ latent variables _ of _ observable image representations _",

    "other theoretic approaches have been proposed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "interesting control applications of linear differential - delay systems may be found in @xcite .",
    "characterizing differential flatness and flat outputs has been an active topic since the beginning of this theory .",
    "the interested reader may find a historical perspective of this question in @xcite .",
    "constructive algorithms , relying on standard computer algebra environments , may be found e.g. in @xcite for nonlinear finite - dimensional systems , or @xcite for linear systems over ore algebras .    for algebraic reasons recalled in section  [ sys : sec ] ,",
    "the notions of @xmath0-freeness and @xmath0-flatness have been introduced in the context of linear differential - delay systems by @xcite and then for linear time - varying differential - delay systems , with polynomial time dependence , by @xcite .    the results and algorithms proposed in this paper concern time - varying differential - delay systems with meromorphic time - dependence .",
    "our approach may be seen as an extension of @xcite to this context .",
    "our main contributions are ( 1 ) a new definition of @xmath0- and @xmath0-@xmath1-flatness , ( 2 ) the characterization of @xmath0- and @xmath0 - 0-flatness in terms of the _ hyper - regularity _ of the system matrices , ( 3 ) yielding an elementary algorithm , of polynomial time complexity , to compute @xmath0- and @xmath0 - 0-flat outputs , based on the row / column reduction of the former matrices .",
    "let us emphasize that the introduced definitions are directly suitable for motion planning and that our formalism is able to consider state and input variables separately or not .",
    "note that , though the natural algebraic framework used to describe such systems is based on a ring , denoted by @xmath2 , of polynomials in both the delay and differential operators , which is non principal , the evaluation of our @xmath0- and @xmath0 - 0-flatness criteria relies upon computations over a principal ideal ring , denoted by @xmath3 , containing @xmath2 , thus making the computations much simpler .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a first section briefly presents recalls on operators and signals ( section  [ op - sig : sec ] ) , followed by recalls on matrices over the non commutative differential ring @xmath2 ( section  [ mat - hyp - reg : sec ] ) . in the latter section , the notions of hyper - regularity and row and column reduction are introduced and characterized in this non commutative context .",
    "section  [ sys : sec ] then deals with differential algebraic notions of systems , @xmath0-flatness and @xmath0-@xmath1-flatness and contains the main results characterizing @xmath0-flat and @xmath0 - 0-flat outputs .",
    "algorithms to compute such @xmath0-flat and @xmath0 - 0-flat outputs are then deduced .",
