    "this was improved to @xmath23 by busenberg & martelli @xcite and finally to @xmath10 by busenberg , fisher & martelli @xcite who also gave another proof for @xmath9 in any hilbert space using wirtinger s inequality .",
    "an obvious extension of the simple two - dimensional example @xmath24 shows that @xmath9 is sharp in any hilbert space .",
    "busenberg , fisher & martelli @xcite also constructed an example of an ode on a periodic orbit of period @xmath25 , which when viewed as a subset of @xmath26 ^ 2)$ ] has lipschitz constant @xmath27 , showing that @xmath10 is sharp for general banach spaces .",
    "+ however , some interesting questions about minimal periods remain unanswered .",
    "does there exist an ode in a finite - dimensional banach space such that the lower bound of @xmath28 is obtained ?",
    "does @xmath29 characterise hilbert spaces ? is there a ( non - hilbert ) banach space for which @xmath30 ?    the results in this paper address this last question .",
    "first we show that in strictly convex banach spaces necessarily @xmath31 . for these normed topological vector spaces",
    "the unit ball is a strictly convex set .",
    "it is easy to see that the unit balls in @xmath32 and @xmath33 contain a line segment and are therefore not strictly convex sets whereas the unit balls for all @xmath34 are strictly convex .",
    "this result nicely complements the current theory because the only example for a banach space with @xmath10 is @xmath35 .",
    "+ however , we prove not only that the inequality is strict in any strictly convex banach space but we are also able to push the bound a little further for the simplest family of interesting finite - dimensional banach spaces , namely @xmath36 , that is @xmath37 equipped with the @xmath38-norm , @xmath39    it is remarkable that even for euclidean spaces with the family of @xmath38-norms the optimal constant is not known in @xmath40 ) . ] for @xmath41 . our second contribution in this paper",
    "is to point out that by using a generalised form of wirtinger s inequality , one can find explicit bounds on @xmath6 which are strictly larger than @xmath42 in a range of @xmath38-spaces near @xmath15 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "a similar argument also works in the infinite - dimensional lebesgue spaces @xmath13 .",
    "we should mention the interesting related result , due to zevin @xcite , that if @xmath3 is a finite - dimensional banach space and one considers the second order equation @xmath44 with @xmath45 lipschitz with constant @xmath46 , then @xmath47 independent of the space @xmath3 .",
    "( the paper @xcite claims a similar result for the first order equation @xmath48 , but there is a small error in the proof of equation ( 11 ) . nevertheless , zevin s argument readily yields the result we have stated for @xmath44 . )",
    "let us start this section by stating the main result of this paper :    [ main result ] let @xmath3 be a strictly convex banach space . then @xmath49    in fact the proof of this statement is a refinement of an integral inequality originally introduced by busenberg , martelli & fisher @xcite .",
    "the revised version of the result is summarised in the following lemma .",
    "[ banachlemma ] let @xmath3 be a normed space and @xmath50 be a continuous , @xmath1-periodic function such that @xmath51 is integrable .",
    "then @xmath52 if @xmath3 is a strictly convex banach space , then the above inequality is in fact strict .",
    "before we go into details of the proof , we show how busenberg , fisher & martelli used it to establish @xmath53 for any banach space .    applying lemma [ banachlemma ] and using the lipschitz continuity of @xmath4 , it follows that @xmath54 dividing both sides of the inequality by @xmath55 yields the result .",
    "we now turn to the main proof of this section .",
    "[ integral lemma martelli ] we know that @xmath56 is periodic with period @xmath1 . hence its integral over one period is shift invariant and thus @xmath57 using the above observation , we can derive the following integral expression    @xmath58    the last inner integral has been taken over one period , so we may shift it by @xmath59 in order to obtain @xmath60 giving us the desired inequality for arbitrary banach spaces .",
    "+ from now on we consider the case when @xmath3 is in fact a strictly convex banach space .",
    "the only actual inequality in the above argument occurs in line ( [ inequality martelli ] ) where we use the triangle inequality for the banach space @xmath3 .",
    "note that in doing so , we have a weight @xmath61 in front of the inner integral which vanishes at @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , if we show that this inequality actually has to be strict for some @xmath63 and some @xmath64 , our statement follows . additionally ,",
    "because of the weight , these conditions are tight as the triangle inequality could fail to be strict at @xmath62 without causing the chain of inequalities to become strict .",
    "note that from the continuity of @xmath65 we obtain that the functions @xmath66 @xmath67 are continuous as well .",
    "fix @xmath63 and @xmath64 , fix an arbitrarily fine decomposition @xmath68 and abbreviate @xmath69    if there is in fact equality in ( 1 ) , then we need to have equality in every step of iteratively applying the triangle inequality and thus @xmath70 w.l.o.g .",
    "we assume that all the terms satisfy @xmath71 .",
    "strict convexity implies in the last line of this argument that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are collinear . by the same reasoning @xmath74 and @xmath75 are collinear , however , the last expression itself is collinear to @xmath76 as well as @xmath77 .",
    "iterating this argument shows that all @xmath78 are necessarily collinear . using the continuity of @xmath65 , making the partition sufficiently small and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus",

    "since @xmath56 is periodic with period @xmath1 , @xmath93 this implies that @xmath94 is a scalar multiple of @xmath84 , in which case @xmath95 this establishes that @xmath96 is one - dimensional , that is @xmath97 for some @xmath98 and a continuous , @xmath99periodic function @xmath100 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] .",
    "+ going back to an earlier stage of the argument , we had that for any fixed @xmath63 and @xmath101 the application of the triangle inequality needs to be strict , that is @xmath102 plugging in the relation @xmath103 , we require that for any fixed @xmath85 with @xmath64 @xmath104 however , since @xmath105 is continuous and @xmath106 @xmath105 has to vanish in a point , say @xmath107 . for @xmath92",
    "very small , we have @xmath108 while @xmath109 proving that @xmath110",
    "the second part of this paper is devoted to establishing explicit bounds for a certain class of @xmath38-spaces .",
    "the idea of our approach goes back to the proof that @xmath29 in any hilbert space which is based on an analogue of wirtinger s inequality for hilbert spaces . in the following we adapt this idea by using the work of croce & dacorogna @xcite who found the optimal constant in a generalised set of wirtinger inequalities , including the case of interest to us here .",
    "they showed that for @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the space of @xmath113-functions @xmath114 whose weak first derivative lies in @xmath113 , one has @xmath115 where @xmath116 is sharp .",

    "one can see that the constant is optimal by considering @xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
