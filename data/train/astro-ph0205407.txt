    "the change in the continuum flux of quasars by stars or compact objects in intervening galaxies ( gravitational microlensing ) is now a well - established observational phenomenon .",
    "several studies have attempted to resolve the structure of the region generating the optical and uv continuum by using the microlensing effect as a gravitational telescope ( see yonehara 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , it has usually been assumed that the size of the region generating the broad emission lines ( bels ) of quasars is too large ( 0.11 pc within the framework of the standard model , rees 1984 ) to be substantially affected by stellar - mass lenses . according to previous studies ( nemiroff 1988 ; schneider & wambsganss 1990 ) , by comparing one line in different components of a multiple - image quasar , we would be able to detect only fractional deviations of the lensed from the unlensed profile . even using optimistic estimates for the microlens masses",
    ", these deviations would amount to a modest 1030% range . however , new results concerning the blr structure and kinematics are relevant to these studies , and could substantially change the common view about the expected influence of microlensing events on the bel profiles . a recent study ( wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ) that compares the blr size determinations obtained using both the reverberation and",
    "the photoionization techniques for a sample of 19 low luminosity agn ( mainly seyferts ) inferred a size in the range of a few light days to a few light weeks .",
    "for agn of greater luminosity ( qsos ) kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived sizes from the balmer lines in the range from 13 to 514 light days , finding a global scaling of the blr size as a function of the intrinsic luminosity , @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to revisit the influence of microlensing in the bel by incorporating these new results . in ",
    "2 we estimate the possibility of microlensing on the blr of different known multiple - image quasars . in ",
    "3 we use simple , but not kinematically unrealistic , models of blrs to study qualitatively the effects that microlensing can produce on the line profiles . in ",
    "4 the observational implications and applications will be discussed .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "only extended objects of sizes comparable to or smaller than the einstein radius associated with the gravitational lens will experience appreciable amplifications ( e.g. , schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) .",
    "thus , in the framework of the agn standard model where the blr is supposed to have a radius in the 0.11 pc range , only massive deflectors could give rise to significant amplifications .",
    "however , recent results from the macho project indicate that the most likely microdeflector masses in the galactic halo are in the range 0.150.9 @xmath2 ( alcock et al .",
    "2000b ) . in the galactic bulge",
    "the microdeflector masses are in good agreement with normal - mass stars ( alcock et al .",
    "estimates from the lightcurve of q  2237 + 0305 ( wyithe , webster , & turner 2000 ) are also in reasonable agreement with these values .",
    "consequently , significant amplifications of the bel would not be expected according to the standard model .",
    "this result has been pointed out by other authors ( nemiroff 1988 ; schneider & wambsganss 1990 ) , even if they were somewhat optimistic concerning the distribution of the microlens mass adopted .",
    "however , recent research on the bel seems to indicate that the blr could be substantially smaller than expected in the standard model ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) . based on the idea that ` the continuum / emission line cross - correlation function measures the responsivity - weighted radius of the blr ( koratkar & gaskell , 1991 ) ' , wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have obtained reliable size measurements .",
    "the sizes obtained using this technique ( reverberation mapping ) are consistent with the substantially more extensive but less accurate measurements inferred from the photoionization method .",
    "the results summarized by wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) exhibited a large scatter ( from 1.4 to 107 days ) which could be attributed to : i ) the different size / structure of the blr in different objects , and ii ) the different sizes of the regions associated with emission lines of different degrees of ionization .",
    "the latter possibility has been neatly exemplified in the case of ngc 5548 , in which luminosity - weighted radii ranging from @xmath0 2.5 days for the he  ii @xmath31640 line to the 28 days corresponding to the [ c  iii ] @xmath31909 line have been found ( peterson & wandel 1999 ) .",
    "ngc 5548 and the other objects in the sample of wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are agn of relatively low luminosity",
    ". however , there is a range of luminosities among the lensed qsos . to take this fact into account we use the results from kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who found a dependence between the blr size and the intrinsic luminosity of the agn , @xmath1 .      for a typical lens configuration ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the projected einstein radius of the microlens on the source is @xmath6 light - days ( for a @xmath7 flat cosmology and @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "objects with @xmath10 are significantly affected by microlensing .",
    "so the relevant question is whether in the sample of the @xmath11 known gravitational lens systems there exist some lensed quasars with blr radius @xmath12 . to answer this question",
    "we can apply the kaspi relationship @xmath1 using ngc 5548 as a reference object .",
    "we adopt two values for the blr size of ngc 5548 in order to account for its stratification : 21.2 light - days ( balmer lines , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) and 2.5 light - days ( high ionization , he  ii line , peterson & wandel 1999 ) .",
    "one can straightforwardly verify that for a @xmath13 ( 1 ) quasar with @xmath14 ( 22.5 ) would have the same @xmath15 as ngc 5548 , i.e. , the microlensing on the blr would be quite pronounced .",
    "multiple - image objects of this apparent magnitude can be detected and , in fact , there are several examples among the currently known gravitational lens systems .",
    "we can refine this rough estimate by taking into account the redshift and apparent magnitude of each lensed object . with this aim , in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show contour plots of the blr radius as a function of the source redshift and apparent magnitude using both reference values for the blr of ngc 5548 and the @xmath1 law .",
    "we have also included in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the observed redshift ",
    "magnitude values corresponding to a sample of 31 qsos selected from the @xmath11 known gravitational lenses with the criteria of having the lens and source redshifts and the optical magnitude well determined .",
    "we have used the @xmath16 magnitude of the brightest lensed image ( in b 1933 + 507 , b 2045 + 265 , mg 0414 + 0534 , pks 1830 - 211 and other four unlabeled objects we have inferred @xmath16 from @xmath17 using @xmath18 ; in hst 1413 + 5211 and other unlabeled object we have inferred @xmath16 from @xmath19 using @xmath20 ) .",
    "the data have been mainly obtained from the castles web page ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles ) . for the previous and subsequent calculations we have adopted from ned the visible magnitude and redshift of ngc 5548 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . to transform apparent magnitudes into intrinsic luminosities",
    "we have made use of the equation @xmath23 , which relates the absolute luminosity of the source , the luminosity distance , @xmath24 , the apparent flux , @xmath25 , and the spectral index , @xmath26 , defined by @xmath27 .",
    "we have considered an @xmath7 flat cosmology and a value for the spectral index @xmath28 ( e.g. , richards et al . 2001 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we can identify a group of ten systems with magnitude @xmath29 that would lie in the region @xmath30 light - days ( balmer lines ) and in the region @xmath31 light - days ( high - ionization lines ) .",
    "these systems are possibly affected by microlensing , with particular strength in the case of the high - ionization lines .",
    "however , the observed magnitudes of the lensed qsos should be corrected by extinction and gravitational lens amplification .",
    "the amount of extinction in the gravitational lenses is unknown for most of them , but it can be in the range from dust - free lenses to strongly reddened systems ( e.g. , falco et al .",
    "1999 ; muoz et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "we selected the magnitude from the brightest qso image , which in most of the cases is the less reddened .",
    "as a first approximation to the expected amount of obscuration we can adopt the mean extinction , @xmath32 , derived by falco , kochanek , & muoz ( 1998 ) comparing the statistics of radio and optical lensed quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "the quasar source is amplified by the gravitational lens and the true luminosity of the unlensed quasar should be calculated by fitting a lens model to each system .",
    "the exact amplification of each gravitational lens system depends on the lens model and on the particular configuration of the system , but an average expected amplification between the brightest image and the unlensed source is @xmath33 mag ( e.g. , lehr et al .",
    "thus , a roughly averaged correction of the combined effects of extinction and lens amplification can be made by adding @xmath34 mag to the apparent qso magnitude .",
    "taking into account the + 1 mag shift , the number of possible candidates affected by microlensing ( at least in the high - ionization lines ) is increased to 12 ( @xmath35% of the sample , see fig .",
    "our selection procedure could include not only intrinsically low - luminosity but also reddened objects in the list of candidates .",
    "as we have seen , a 1 mag shift due to underestimation of the extinction will not substantially modify the set of candidates .",
    "this moderates the impact of the extinction uncertainties in the selection of candidates , but we can not discard the possibility that our statistics were biased by heavily reddened objects of intrinsically high luminosity . this is the case for b 0218 + 357 , which according to the rest - frame @xmath36 obtained from falco et al .",
    "( 1999 ) would be an intrinsically high - luminosity object reddened by extinction .",
    "mg 0414 + 0534 is also a very reddened object , but in this case probably owing to a very red intrinsic spectral distribution ( @xmath37 was measured at optical wavelengths by hewitt et al .",
    "this implies that mg 0414 + 0534 could have a high intrinsic rest - frame v luminosity but also indicates that this object is probably a radio galaxy rather than a qso .",
    "the identification of the candidates available in the literature supports the hypothesis that most of them are intrinsically low - luminosity objects , since in most cases the objects can not be clearly classified as bright qsos but admit alternative classifications as objects with lower levels of activity ( radio galaxies , underluminous qsos , starburst galaxies , seyfert 2 galaxies , or other types of agns ) .",
    "this also implies that we have probably overestimated the luminosities of the candidate objects because we have not removed the contribution from the galaxy , which is probably far from negligible .",
    "it would be very useful to compute the expected amplifications for each object in the list of candidates .",
    "however , lack of knowledge of the extinction in each system and , to some extent , of a precise classification of the source , could affect the results significantly .",
    "we have selected the gravitational lens discovered by jackson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , b 1600 + 434 , a double - imaged typical quasar at @xmath38 , lensed by an edge - on spiral galaxy at @xmath39 , in which both the lens amplification and the extinction might be reasonably well known . to calculate the amplification induced in b 1600 + 434 by the lens galaxy",
    "we have fitted a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) to this double - imaged quasar .",
    "thus , we obtain an amplification of 0.96 mag for the brightest quasar image , which has an observed v - band magnitude of @xmath40 . for the extinction we have used the result from falco et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , @xmath41 mag . from the intrinsic luminosity obtained after correcting for amplification and extinction ( @xmath42 ) and using the kaspi et al .",
    "relationship , we have estimated radii of 45 and 5.3 ligth - days for the balmer and he  ii blrs , respectively ( according to the two values of reference adopted for ngc 5548 ) .    to estimate the maximum amplification , @xmath43 , we adopt the expression ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the blr radius , and @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the angular diameter distances to the lens and the qso respectively , and @xmath50 is the angular diameter lens ",
    "qso distance ) .",
    "if we apply these formulae to b 1600 + 434 , we find that a solar - mass stellar microlens would induce a modest , albeit potentially observable , amplification of 1.4 in the balmer lines and a strong amplification of 8.2 in he  ii .",
    "a @xmath51 microlens would also induce an appreciable amplification of 2.76 in the he  ii lines .",
    "we do not calculate the amplification by microlensing on the bel for the other objects in the list because the exact amount of extinction is unknown for most of them , and because we can no longer suppose that the @xmath52 dependence of the energy distribution is a realistic approach for some of the objects .    in summary , although most of the lensed quasars ( @xmath53 of the total ) are intrinsically high - luminosity quasars ( so that no strong microlensing in the bel is expected ) we found that @xmath54 of the lensed sources are faint enough to be considered as possibly affected by microlensing in the bel .",
    "when an organized velocity field governs the kinematics of the blr , microlensing can give rise to a selective amplification of the emission - line profile ( nemiroff 1988 ) .",
    "the shape of the line depends on the location of the source with respect to the optical axis ( defined by the observer and the microlens ) and can change with the relative movement between the microlens and the blr . in this section",
    "we adopt the kinematic models for the blr used by robinson ( 1995 ) to study the range of profile shapes that exists among agn in the context of a simple parameterization of some basic properties of the blr such as emissivity and velocity law .",
    "our intention is to study , in this framework , the effects induced in the line profile by a microlens in different locations with respect to the center of the blr .",
    "we assume that a single microdeflector is affecting the blr .",
    "this supposition adequately serves the objectives of the present paper ( a more realistic approach based on the existence of a random distribution of microdeflectors will be analyzed in a future paper ) .    in accordance with robinson ( 1995 )",

    ", one notable property of robinson s models is that the profile shape depends only on @xmath77 .",

    "could the presence of microlensing break this degeneracy for a spherical shell ?",
    "such questions as the existence of a monotonically increasing or decreasing dependence with radial distance of the velocity field may have a formal answer . in principle , it would be possible to invert the line - profile expression ( eq . [ ecflux ] ) obtained for several different positions of the microlens to recuperate , making suitable suppositions , the law for radial velocities .",

    "if the models and assumptions of the previous sections constitute a good description of blr microlensing , we could conclude that the effects of this phenomenon on the line profiles should be not only noticeable but also easily detectable in some lens systems .    the experimental situation , however , is more complex . in first place ,",
    "the bels are blended with the narrow emission lines , which come from the much more extended narrow - line region ( nlr ) , which would be not affected by microlensing .",
    "in fact , it is likely that diverse transition regions between the blr and the nlr could also contribute to the core of the line profile .",
    "second , the compactness of the lens systems makes observation very difficult . for instance , in the case ( b  1600 + 434 ) in which we have obtained a realistic estimate for microlensing amplification there are two compact images , the lens galaxy ( an edge - on spiral ) , and some additional extended emission , all within a separation of @xmath117 .",
    "this is a major setback when trying to obtain individual spectra , and only modern spectroscopic techniques ( 2d spectroscopy , mediavilla et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) or observation from space avoid the problems induced by source blending and differential atmospheric refraction . in any case , to detect microlensing we should obtain spectra ( preferably of high - ionization lines ) with a high s / n ratio in the wings of the line profile , where the contribution from the blr would be dominant .    the emissivity is another important parameter that can affect the detection of microlensing in bels . in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] we present the ratio of the amplified to unamplified line profiles corresponding to the modified keplerian case , where we have changed the emissivity parameter , @xmath118 . for a highly concentrated blr ( @xmath119 ) the effect is stronger when the blr is almost centered on the microlens and weak for larger displacements of the microlens with respect to the center of the blr .",
    "but when the emissivity is constant ( for a disk of uniform brightness , @xmath120 ) the effects of microlensing remain noticeable for all displacements considered and are hence more likely to be observed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have labeled the gravitational lens systems in which significant bel microlensing could be detected ( 30% of the total ) . however , in other systems a modest effect could be detectable by looking at high - ionization lines .",
    "this is important because other questions than the amplification , such as the crossing time of the microlens across the blr or the frequency of the events , can lead us to study a gravitational lens system in particular .",
    "for instance , in a favorable case it would be possible not only to compare the line profile corresponding to microlensed and non - microlensed images but also to observe in the line profile of an image changes attributable to the microlens crossing . in the most favorable case from this perspective , q 2237 + 0305 , microlensing events are reported each year with crossing times of the order of a year or less . however , this is a bright qso in which only very modest amplifications of 30% or less can be expected in the high - ionization lines .",
    "this estimation of the amplification is , in any case , subject to changes in the blr - size vs qso - luminosity relationship , and also to the expected intrinsic dispersion from object to object .    in spite of the last comment ,",
    "the amplifications associated with the high - ionization lines could be high in many cases , and only a strong departure from the assumptions made in this study ( e.g. , a severe underestimate of the extinction , very different behavior of the blr - size / qso - magnitude relationship , or an unexpectedly low - mass population of microlenses ) could avoid the detection of microlensing in the bels by comparing the high - ionization line profiles of a microlensed and a non - microlensed image in the most favorable cases . according to this , the study of the incidence of microlensing in bels could become a tool for studying the blr size and stratification , especially when lines of different ionization are observed .",
    "in the light of recent discoveries concerning the blr size and its scaling with agn luminosity , currently accepted values for microlens masses , and a variety of kinematic models for the blr , we have revisited the influence of microlensing in the bel .",
    "we have computed grids of line profiles corresponding to different displacements of the microlens with respect to the blr center .",
    "some results are worth summarizing :    1.- the global amplification of the bel induced by microlensing events could be relevant .",
    "we identify a group of ten gravitational lens systems ( about 30% of the total sample ) for which the microlensing effect could be observable , especially in high - ionization lines .",
    "in other gravitational lenses the microlensing amplifications would be much more modest .",
    "2.- even for relatively small microlenses corresponding to high values of the blr radius / einstein radius quotient , ( @xmath121 ) , the effects produced by the differential amplification of the line profile ( relative enhancement of different parts of the line profile , line asymmetries , displacement of the peak of the line , etc .",
    ") would be easily detectable except for highly symmetric velocity fields .",
    "the displacement of the peak of the line profile caused by microlensing is especially interesting , since it could otherwise induce inexplicable redshift differences between the different images in a gravitational lens system .",
    "3.- the study of the changes between the bel profiles corresponding to microlensed and non - microlensed images , or among the bel profiles of lines with different ionization in a microlensed image could be useful for probing current ideas about blr size and stratification .",
    "we would like to acknowledge valuable and useful comments of the anonymous referee .",

    "nowadays , there is no generally accepted model for the geometry and dynamics of the broad line region .",
    "so , we adopt in this paper the discrete cloud model ( see robinson 1995 ) in which it is assumed that the magnitude of the velocity and the volume emissivity may be independently specified by a power law . it is also assumed that the clouds or volume elements emit line radiation isotropically .",
