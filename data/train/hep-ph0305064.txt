    "recently , several studies on cpt violation @xcite have been performed in order to incorporate the so - called lsnd anomaly @xcite within the description of standard three flavor neutrino oscillations .",
    "however , this requires a new mass squared difference different from the ones coming from atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrinos , which means that one would need to have three mass squared differences instead of two  a scenario , which is not consistent with ordinary models of three flavor neutrino oscillations .",
    "therefore , in most of the studies on cpt violation @xcite , different mass squared differences and mixing parameters are introduced phenomenologically by hand for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "this results , in the three neutrino flavor picture , in two mass squared differences and four mixing parameters for neutrinos and the same for antineutrinos , _",
    "i.e. _ , in total , four mass squared differences and eight mixing parameters .",
    "thus , it is possible to have a different mass squared difference describing the results of the lsnd experiment other than the ones describing atmospheric and solar neutrino data .",
    "it should be noted that the results of the lsnd experiment will be further tested by the miniboone experiment @xcite , which started running in september 2002 .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned that the standard way of incorporating the lsnd data is to introduce sterile neutrinos , and therefore , the introduction of fundamental cpt violation , sometimes also called _ genuine _ cpt violation , serves as an alternative description to sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , neutrino oscillations between pure sterile flavors and active and sterile flavors have , in principle , been excluded by the sno experiment @xcite .    in cpt violation studies ,",
    "the cpt invariance theorem @xcite , a milestone of local quantum field theory , obviously does not hold , and in addition , fundamental properties such as lorentz invariance and locality may also be violated . however , the @xmath0 standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics , for which the cpt theorem is valid , is in very good agreement with all existing experimental data . therefore , fundamental cpt violation is connected to physics beyond the sm such as string theory or models including extra dimensions , in which cpt invariance could be violated .",
    "the recent and the first results of the kamland experiment @xcite , which is a reactor long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment measuring the @xmath1 flux from distant nuclear reactors in japan and south korea , strongly favor the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution region for solar neutrino oscillations and the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , they indicate that there is no need for fundamental cpt violation , _",
    "i.e. _ , having different mass squared differences for solar neutrinos and reactor antineutrinos .",
    "thus , solar neutrino data and kamland data can be simultaneously and consistently accommodated with the same mass squared difference .    in this paper , we investigate matter - induced ( or extrinsic ) cpt violation effects in neutrino oscillations in matter . in a previous paper @xcite , the interplay between fundamental and matter - induced t violation effects has been discussed . in the case of cpt violation effects , there exists no fundamental ( or intrinsic ) cpt violation effects if we assume that the cpt theorem holds .",
    "this means that the matter - induced cpt violation is a pure effect of the simple fact that ordinary matter consists of unequal numbers of particles and antiparticles .",
    "matter - induced cpt violation , sometimes also called _ fake _ cpt violation , have been studied and illustrated in some papers @xcite , in which numerical calculations of cpt - violating asymmetries between survival probabilities for neutrinos and antineutrinos in different scenarios of atmospheric and long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments have been presented . here",
    "we will try to perform a much more systematic study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : genform ] , we discuss the general formalism and properties of cpt violation in vacuum and in matter . in particular , we derive approximate analytical formulas for all cpt - violating probability differences for three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter with an arbitrary matter density profile .",
    "the derivations are performed using first order perturbation theory in the small leptonic mixing angle @xmath2 for the neutrino and antineutrino evolution operators as well as the fact that @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the solar mass squared difference is some orders of magnitude smaller than the atmospheric mass squared difference . at the end of this section , we consider two different explicit examples of matter density profiles .",
    "these are constant and step - function matter density profiles . in both cases ,",
    "we present the first order perturbation theory formulas for the cpt probability differences as well as the useful corresponding low - energy region formulas .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : numcal ] , we discuss the implications for long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments and potential neutrino factory setups as well as solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we illuminate the discussion with several tables and plots of the cpt probability differences .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : s&c ]",
    ", we present a summary of the obtained results as well as our conclusions . finally , in app .",
    "[ app : evolop ] , we give details of the general analytical derivation of the evolution operators for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "let us by @xmath4 ) denote the transition probability from a neutrino flavor @xmath5 to a neutrino flavor @xmath6 , and similarly , for antineutrino flavors . then ,",
    "the cp , t , and cpt ( -violating ) probability differences are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the cp and t probability differences have previously been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will study in detail the cpt probability differences .",
    "let us first dicuss some general properties of the cpt probability differences .",
    "in general , _",
    "i.e. _ , both in vacuum and in matter , it follows from conservation of probability that @xmath9 in words , the sum of the transition probabilities of a given neutrino ( antineutrino ) flavor into neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) of all possible flavors is , of course , equal to one , _",
    "i.e. _ , the probability is conserved .",
    "using the definitions of the cpt probability differences , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : probsum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : probsum2 ] ) can be re - written as @xmath10 note that not all of these equations are linearly independent .",
    "for example , for three neutrino flavors , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cptsum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cptsum2 ] ) can be written as the following system of equations @xmath11 hence , there are nine cpt probability differences for neutrinos and six equations relating these cpt probability differences .",
    "the rank of the corresponding system matrix for the above system of equations is five , which means that only five of the six equations are linearly independent .",
    "thus , five out of the nine cpt probability differences can be expressed in terms of the other four , _",
    "i.e. _ , there are , in fact , only four cpt probability differences . choosing , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 as the known cpt probability differences , the other five can be expressed as @xmath16 furthermore , the cpt probability differences for neutrinos are related to the ones for antineutrinos by @xmath17 where @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the cpt probability differences for antineutrinos do not give any further information .",
    "for completeness , we shall also briefly consider the case of two neutrino flavors . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath18 from which one immediately obtains @xmath19 thus , for two neutrino flavors there is only one linearly independent cpt probability difference , which we , _ e.g. _ , can choose as @xmath20 .    generally , for the t probability differences , we have @xcite @xmath21 for three neutrino flavors and @xmath22 for two neutrino flavors .",
    "thus , in the case of three neutrino flavors , there is only one linearly independent t probability difference , whereas in the case of two neutrino flavors , neutrino oscillations are t - invariant irrespective of whether they take place in vacuum or in matter .    using the definitions  ( [ eq : cp ] ) - ( [ eq : cpt ] )",
    ", one immediately observes that the cp probability differences are directly related to the t and cpt probability differences by the following formulas @xmath23 in vacuum , where cpt invariance holds , one has @xmath24 , which means that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , using again the definition  ( [ eq : cp ] ) , one finds that @xmath27 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , _ i.e. _ , the cp probability differences for neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) are given by the corresponding t probability differences for neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) .",
    "however , in matter , cpt invariance is no longer valid in general , and thus , one has @xmath30 , which means that we need to know both the t and cpt probability differences in order to determine the cp probability differences .",
    "moreover , in vacuum , it follows in general that @xmath31 and in particular that @xmath32 , which leads to @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , cp violation effects can not occur in disappearance channels ( @xmath34 ) , but only in appearance channels ( @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ) @xcite , while in matter one has in general @xmath37 .    in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss the hamiltonians and evolution operators for neutrinos and antineutrinos , which we will use to calculate the cpt probability differences .      if neutrinos are massive and mixed , then the neutrino flavor fields @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , are linear combinations of the neutrino mass eigenfields @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of neutrino flavors and the @xmath44 s are the matrix elements of the unitary leptonic mixing matrix @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath2 , and @xmath49 are the leptonic mixing angles and @xmath50 is the leptonic cp violation phase . ]",
    "thus , we have the following relation between the neutrino flavor and mass states @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath40 is the @xmath52th neutrino mass state for a neutrino with definite 3-momentum @xmath53 , energy @xmath54 ( if @xmath55 ) , and negative helicity . here",
    "@xmath56 is the mass of the @xmath52th neutrino mass eigenstate and @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , for antineutrinos , we have @xmath58 in the ultra - relativistic approximation , the quantum mechanical time evolution of the neutrino states and the neutrino oscillations are governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the neutrino vector of state and @xmath61 is the time - dependent hamiltonian of the system , which is different for neutrinos and antineutrinos and its form also depends on in which basis it is given ( see app .",
    "[ app : evolop ] for the different expressions of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "hence , the neutrino evolution ( _ i.e. _ , the solution to the schrdinger equation ) is given by @xmath62 where the exponential function is time - ordered .",
    "note that if one assumes that neutrinos are stable and that they are not absorbed in matter , then the hamiltonian @xmath61 is hermitian .",
    "this will be assumed throughout this paper .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to define the evolution operator ( or the evolution matrix ) @xmath63 as @xmath64 which has the following obvious properties @xmath65 the last property is the unitarity condition , which follows directly from the hermiticity of the hamiltonian @xmath61 .",
    "neutrinos are produced in weak interaction processes as flavor states @xmath66 , where @xmath39 . between a source , the production point of neutrinos , and a detector , neutrinos",
    "evolve as mass eigenstates @xmath67 , where @xmath41 , _",

    "we calculate the cpt probability differences both in vacuum and in matter .      in vacuum ,",
    "the matter potential is zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80 , and therefore , the evolution operators for neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the free hamiltonian and @xmath83 is the baseline length .",
    "note that the hamiltonians in vacuum for neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same , since we have assumed the cpt theorem .",
    "thus , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prob_nu ] ) and ( [ eq : prob_antinu ] ) , it directly follows that @xmath84 which means that there is simply no ( intrinsic ) cpt violation in neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "note that this general result holds for any number of neutrino flavors .",
    "furthermore , note that even though there is no intrinsic cpt violation effects in vacuum , there could be intrinsic cp and t violation effects induced by a non - zero cp ( or t ) violation phase @xmath50 , which could , if sizeable enough , be measured by very long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments in the future @xcite .    in matter , the situation is slightly more complicated than in vacuum .",
    "however , the technique is the same , _",
    "i.e. _ , the extrinsic cpt probability differences are given by differences of different matrix elements of the evolution operators for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the probability amplitude of neutrino flavor transitions are the matrix elements of the evolution operators : @xmath85_{\\beta\\alpha } = \\left [ s_f(t , t_0 )    \\right]_{\\beta\\alpha},\\\\    a \\left ( \\bar\\nu_{\\alpha } \\rightarrow \\bar\\nu_{\\beta }",

    "( [ eq : sf ] ) and ( [ eq : antisf ] ) , respectively , the different @xmath87 s are now easily found , but the expressions are quite unwieldy .",
    "the cpt probability difference @xmath12 to first order in perturbation theory is found to be given by ( see app .",
    "[ app : evolop ] for definitions of different quantities ) @xmath88 which is equal to zero in vacuum , in which @xmath80 .",
    "note that in the case of t violation all diagonal elements , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , are trivially equal to zero [ _ cf .",
    "_ , eq .  ( [ eq : dpdiag ] ) ] .",
    "this is obviously not the case for cpt violation if matter is present .",
    "similarly , we find @xmath91 note that @xmath12 is the only cpt probability difference that is uniquely determined by the ( 1,2)-subsector of the full three flavor neutrino evolution , see the explicit expressions of the evolution operators for neutrinos and antineutrinos [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) and ( [ eq : antisf ] ) ] .",
