    "we will show that the radiative efficiency of an accreting black hole ( @xmath0 , @xmath7 is the luminosity , @xmath8 is the mass accretion rate ) depends on the magnetic field strength .",
    "an investigation similar to ours , but with different conclusions , was carried out by quataert ( 1997 ) .",
    "it was suggested that at low accretion rates , @xmath9 , a two - temperature plasma with @xmath10 forms near the schwarzschild radius of an accreting black hole ( shapiro et al 1976 , phinney 1981 , rees et al 1982 , narayan & yi 1995 ) , and the disk is inflated into a torus by the ion pressure .",
    "the plasma in the torus is collisionless , and coulomb energy exchange between electrons and ions is small .",
    "viscous heating power must be @xmath11 .",
    "if nearly all the heat is released into ions , radiative efficiencies as low as @xmath2 are obtained , because ions take all the heat into the hole .",
    "electrons radiate efficiently , and @xmath12 can not be much smaller than @xmath13 due to adiabatic heating of electrons .",
    "observational estimates for @xmath7 and @xmath8 exist for a number of objects ( narayan et al 1997 , fabian & rees 1995 ) , and some black hole candidates seem to have @xmath14 .",
    "we show here that if indeed @xmath14 , magnetic fields in these accretion flows must be very weak , @xmath1 , where @xmath15 is the gas ( ion ) pressure . for stronger magnetic fields , @xmath4 because electrons receive more than 0.1% of the viscous heat , and this part of the viscous heat is efficiently radiated . at equipartition fields ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "electrons get most of the heat and the radiative efficiency is close to the standard thin disk estimate , @xmath17 .",
    "theoretical models of black hole accretion that assume both @xmath5 and @xmath14 should be abandoned .",
    "the reason why stronger magnetic fields lead to an increased fraction of viscous energy going into electrons ( and correspondingly to larger radiative efficiency ) is roughly as follows . at strong fields , turbulence in the torus",
    "is dominated by alfven waves which are only weakly damped at the length scales @xmath18 ( the ion larmor radius ) , where damping by ions is maximal .",
    "turbulent energy flux gets through the ion damping barrier at scales @xmath18 and cascades to smaller scales . at length scales",
    "@xmath19 , ions drop out of dynamics because of the larmor circle averaging , and the energy flux heats electrons .",
    "the constraint @xmath20 ( for @xmath14 ) is of interest for modeling the spectrum of an accreting black hole .",
    "the radiation spectrum is determined by the synchrotron emission and its comptonization ; the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath21 changes by a factor of 30 when our estimate of @xmath22 is changed from 1 ( which is the standard assumption ) to @xmath23 .",
    "unless the plasma somehow leaves precisely all of its angular momentum behind by the time it reaches the hole , the ion torus will be rotating at about the keplerian speed .",
    "to accrete , the plasma has to transport its angular momentum outwards ( in a frame moving radially with the plasma ) , and this means that hydromagnetic turbulence should develop in the torus .",
    "whatever the nature of turbulence and the resulting turbulent viscosity are , viscous heat will be generated at a rate @xmath24 ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "the question is into which plasma species is this heat deposited .",
    "the ions will take their share into the hole , while most of the electrons share will be radiated .",
    "narayan et al ( 1997 ) and mahadevan ( 1997 ) suggested that the ratio of electron to ion heating , @xmath25 , is given by the mass ratio , @xmath26 .",
    "we will show that such small ratios of electron to ion heating are possible only at very weak magnetic fields .",
    "there are two particle heating mechanisms in a magnetized collisionless plasma - landau heating by electric fields parallel to the local magnetic field and landau heating by the time varying magnetic field ( by the curl of the electric field parallel to the local magnetic field , e.g. stix ( 1992 ) ) . in the advection dominated regime ( narayan & yi 1995 ) near the hole , thermal velocities of electrons and ions are @xmath27 , yet the @xmath28-factors are not large , so that the plasma is roughly non - relativistic . at comparable thermal velocities",
    "landau heating by parallel electric fields is proportional to @xmath29 , and hence it is dominated by electrons , the ratio of electron to ion heating being @xmath30 . for magnetic heating , the charge @xmath31 should be replaced by the magnetic moment , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . the heating ratio is @xmath34 , as narayan and coworkers usually assume .",
    "electron to ion heating ratio will be much greater than @xmath23 if heating by the parallel electric fields is important .",
    "ion heating is also suppressed , and correspondingly electron to ion heating ratio is increased , at small length scales when averaging of the lorentz force over the ion larmor circle becomes important .    to calculate the ratio of electron to ion heating , we must follow the turbulent energy as it cascades from the largest energy containing scales to smaller scales and estimate the strengths of the two damping mechanisms for all scales .",
    "since random magnetic fields limit the mean free path of plasma species to corresponding larmor radii , hydrodynamic description is applicable at large scales , and kolmogorov energy cascade develops . at smaller scales , turbulence is dominated by alfven waves , because the nonlinear frequency @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the energy flux in momentum space , units @xmath37 ) becomes smaller than the linear alfven frequency @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the alfven speed ) . following goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) ( appendix a )",
    ", we assume that for @xmath40 , when alfven frequency is formally larger than the nonlinear frequency , turbulence develops anisotropy , with filamentary perturbations aligned with the local magnetic field , @xmath41 .",
    "degree of anisotropy is determined by a requirement that the spectrum be critically balanced , meaning that hydrodynamic and alfven frequencies are comparable , @xmath42 .    in the critically balanced alfven turbulence regime",
    ", it takes about @xmath43 for a turbulent eddy to cascade to twice its wavenumber .",
    "let @xmath44 be the landau damping rate at a given scale ( calculated in appendix b ) .",
    "the fraction of energy flux intercepted at wavenumber scales @xmath45 is of order @xmath46 - the rest of energy goes to scales of order @xmath47 .",
    "the ratio @xmath48 ( damping to real frequency for linear waves ) is all we need .",
    "this ratio determines at what scales the energy flux is damped , and knowing this it is straightforward to predict which plasma species is heated .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath48 as a function of the perpendicular wavenumber . as seen from the figure , significant fraction of the energy",
    "is damped near the ion larmor radius , @xmath49 , when magnetic fields are weak , @xmath50    for @xmath51 the main damping mechanism of alfven waves is magnetic heating of ions .",
    "the damping rate is given by ( appendix b , for @xmath52 ) @xmath53 at @xmath54 , alfven waves gradually modify into whistlers ( appendices b and c ) , the ions still take most of the heat load , and for @xmath52 , @xmath55 according to the last formula , ion damping becomes small at @xmath56 few .",
    "turbulent energy that gets through the ion damping barrier at @xmath49 is only weakly damped until it reaches very small scales to be damped by electrons ( see appendix c for a discussion of whistler turbulence ) .",
    "ions drop out of the picture at @xmath57 few because of larmor circle averaging .",
    "the ion heating maximum at @xmath49 determines the ratio of electron to ion heating .    at equipartition magnetic fields ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the maximal value of ion damping is @xmath59 at @xmath49 and much smaller at other scales .",
    "most of the viscous heat gets over the ion damping barrier and is ultimately damped in electrons .",
    "figure 2 shows the turbulent energy flow in the wavenumber space ( arrows are drawn by hand ! ) .",
    "the corresponding radiative efficiency is @xmath17 , similar to thin accretion disk models .",
    "the very small radiative efficiency assumed in advection dominated accretion models , @xmath2 , is possible only if a very small fraction , @xmath60 , of the alfven wave energy at @xmath61 is transmitted to whistlers at @xmath56 few .",
    "whistlers can propagate at @xmath62 as small as @xmath63 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "alfven waves are not fully damped at @xmath65 and will excite whistlers by three - wave interactions .",
    "thus , @xmath20 is necessary for @xmath14 .",
    "fortunately , electron parameters ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) do not enter eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "electron thermal velocity and @xmath28-factor are determined by radiation and are not reliably predicted by the advection dominated ( or any other ) accretion model .",
    "however , the only parameter that matters for our calculation is @xmath22 - an input parameter .",
    "our predictions are not limited to any particular model of accretion , as long as @xmath10 and @xmath68 .",
    "a minimal model of turbulence was assumed in this work - no secondary instabilities , no shocks , just a simple kolmogorov cascade with landau damping .",
    "this model predicts substantial heating of electrons and large radiative efficiencies if magnetic fields are close to equipartition .",
    "small radiative efficiency is possible if nearly all the viscous heat is absorbed by ions . for this",
    ", magnetic fields must be very weak , @xmath20 .",
    "incidentally , we can argue that low radiative efficiency is possible only at very weak magnetic fields if we assume that blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) mechanism is at work .",
    "poloidal magnetic field of order @xmath69 near a maximally rotating black hole gives a luminosity @xmath70 .",
    "we get a radiative efficiency @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the shakura - sunayev parameter . arbitrarily assuming @xmath73 , @xmath74 , we get @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 is required for @xmath77 .",
    "i thank john bahcall and martin rees for suggesting the problem , and peter goldreich , pawan kumar and insu yi for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported by nsf phy-9513835 .",
    "this appendix is based on goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath36 is the energy flux in the wavenumber space ( energy pumping rate , units @xmath37 ) .",
    "isotropic kolmogorov turbulence is characterized by a nonlinear frequency @xmath78 at wavenumbers @xmath79 .",
    "if there is a large scale magnetic field with alfven speed @xmath39 , another characteristic frequency of the turbulence is the linear frequency @xmath80 .",
    "if the turbulence were isotropic , the hydrodynamic nonlinear frequency would be much smaller than the linear alfven frequency at small enough scales . according to goldreich & sridhar",
    "this does not happen . instead , turbulent energy propagates to smaller scales within a narrow cone in the @xmath45-space given by @xmath81 . in other words ,",
    "turbulence is dominated by elongated structures , that are aligned with the local magnetic field .",
    "this could be roughly explained as follows .",
    "suppose , that a `` turbulent eddy '' leaves the cone .",
    "on the outside of the cone , turbulence is just a collection of weakly nonlinear waves .",
    "waves propagating parallel and antiparallel to the local magnetic field follow the field lines perturbed by each other , and thus cascade in @xmath82",
    ". turbulent energy from outside of the cone will cascade in @xmath82 without cascading in @xmath83 and will thus enter the cone .",
    "turbulence fills the entire cone , because within the cone the presence of the large - scale magnetic field is not `` felt '' , @xmath84 .",
    "turbulent eddies will try to isotropize themselves , filling as much of the @xmath45-space as possible .",
    "we calculated landau damping of alfven waves ( whistlers at @xmath54 ) numerically using a full dielectric permittivity tensor of a magnetized maxwellian plasma ( e.g. mikhailovskii 1967 ) .",
    "results are shown in fig.1 , where the ratio of imaginary to real parts of the eigenfrequency is plotted versus dimensionless perpendicular wavenumber @xmath62 .",
    "the calculation was carried out for maxwellian electrons and ions with thermal velocities @xmath85 and @xmath86 which are close to the plasma parameters of a two - temperature advection dominated accretion model of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath87 , and checked that @xmath88 does not depend on @xmath89 as long as @xmath90 .",
    "the four curves correspond to four values of @xmath22 .",
    "damping by ions is maximal at @xmath49 , where damping by electrons is negligible . for strong fields , @xmath16 ,",
    "the damping at @xmath49 is small . the damping increases with decreasing @xmath22 .",
    "at @xmath91 , the damping is so strong that alfven waves do not propagate in a narrow region near @xmath92 .",
    "the region of forbidden propagation is narrow for @xmath91 and widens for @xmath93 .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "electrons and ions that resonate with alfven waves and whistlers belong to the bulk of the distribution functions .",
    "deviations from maxwellian distribution , which may be expected in our collisionless plasma , will not strongly affect the results . also , linear and nonlinear landau damping rates are similar , because linear frequencies and nonlinear frequency shifts are of the same order for a critically balanced turbulence .",
    "most of the numerical results shown in fig.1 can be understood analytically . as discussed in",
    " 2 , analytical expressions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are of importance - they imply that our results are model independent . for @xmath41 , @xmath94 , the following approximate expressions for the permittivity tensor ( mikhailovskii 1967 ) give a good accuracy . for a wavenumber in the @xmath95-plane , with @xmath96 along the local magnetic field ,",

    "for alfven waves , in the limit @xmath118 when @xmath103 is pure imaginary , we have approximately @xmath119 giving @xmath120 that is @xmath53 for whistlers at @xmath54 , we have approximately @xmath121 giving @xmath55    at even larger @xmath62 electron damping becomes important .",
    "the ratio of electron to ion damping can be estimated ( for @xmath118 ) as @xmath122 here the wave electric fields should be obtained from the system of linear equations whose determinant is given in eq .",
    "two of these equations can be approximately written as @xmath123 @xmath124 now eq .",
    "( b17 ) gives @xmath125 showing that electron heating dominates for @xmath126 . at these small scales ,",
    "ions are not important either for real part of the frequency or its imaginary part ( heating ) . for perturbations with perpendicular length scales",
    "@xmath127 , ions can be treated as a constant positive background for electrons and electromagnetic fields .",
    "we should make sure that turbulent energy will keep cascading to smaller scales after alfven waves are transformed into whistlers at length scales @xmath18 .",
