    "extending back to the mid - nineteenth century , the history of thermoelectricity can be seen as a continuous struggle to follow kelvin s attempt to understand it as a quasi - thermodynamic phenomenon .",
    "the most important episode in this tale is onsager s formulation of the reciprocal relations@xcite . in 1948",
    ", callen@xcite demonstrated that it provides a solid basis for the kelvin relation between seebeck and peltier coefficients as well as the bridgman relation between nernst and ettingshausen effects@xcite .",
    "today , potential technological applications of materials with a sizeable thermoelectric figure of merit is the subject matter of a vast research activity@xcite . in this context , the nernst - ettingshausen effect , the transverse thermoelectric response emerging in presence of magnetic field , is much less explored than its longitudinal counterpart .",
    "ironically , however , the record of the lowest temperature attained by thermoelectric cooling starting from room temperature is still held by an ettingshausen cooler@xcite , albeit in a magnetic field as strong as 11 t , which severely limits potential applications .    from a fundamental perspective , the nernst effect attracted much attention following the discovery of a sizeable nernst coefficient in a high - temperature cuprate superconductor at the turn of this century@xcite .",
    "numerous studies followed and led to a clarification of how quasi - particles@xcite and gaussian superconducting fluctuations@xcite can generate a nernst signal .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to give a picture of our current understanding of the nernst effect in metals and superconductors . since the publication of two previous review articles@xcite in 2009 ,",
    "experimental and theoretical studies have sharpened our overall picture of transverse thermoelectricity , which we wish to sketch in the present review .",
    "the article begins by framing the significance of thermoelectric response in general and transverse thermoelectricity in particular following a picture first sketched by callen , based on onsager s reciprocity relations .",
    "this is helpful to identify the fundamental constants and the material - dependent length scales which set the magnitude of the transverse thermoelectric response , in a manner , which follows landauer s approach to transport phenomena .",
    "afterwards , we review experimental results and their interpretation in four different contexts where , quasi - particles , short - lived cooper pairs , superconducting vortices and landau tubes are believed to play a prominent role in producing a nernst signal .",
    "we end this review by a brief discussion of other cases , not identified as belonging to any of these four categories .",
    "the application of onsager s reciprocal relations to thermoelectric and thermomagnetic phenomena by callen in 1948 put the kelvin and bridgman relations on a firm ground . back in the nineteenth century , lord kelvin had linked the seebeck and the peltier effects . according to him , these two apparently distinct thermoelectric phenomena , the seebeck , @xmath0 , and the peltier , @xmath1 , coefficients are simply proportional to each other . according to the kelvin relation : @xmath2    the seebeck coefficient is the ratio of the electric field to the thermal gradient applied to generate it . on the other hand , the peltier coefficient is equal to the ratio of heat current density to charge current density .",
    "callen demonstrated that this link is a consequence of onsager s reciprocity .",
    "his analysis led to an alternative definition of the seebeck coefficient . here",
    "are his own words : `` a current flowing in a conductor of a given temperature distribution carries with it an entropy per particle .",
    "this entropy flow is , of course , in addition to the entropy flow [ driven by the temperature gradient ] '' @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be expressed as one of the two components of the entropy flow , @xmath3 : @xmath4    here , @xmath5 is the charge current density , @xmath6 the thermal conductivity and @xmath7 the thermal gradient . as far as we know ,",
    "this equation was first written down in ref.@xcite . according to it , in absence of thermal gradient , the second term in the right hand vanishes and the seebeck coefficient becomes simply the ratio of entropy flow to charge flow .",
    "the counterpart of kelvin relation for transverse thermoelectricity was first proposed in 1924 by bridgman , who proposed a link between nernst , @xmath8 , and ettingshausen , @xmath9 , coefficients through thermal conductivity , @xmath6@xcite :    @xmath10    the nernst coefficient is the transverse electric field produced by a longitudinal thermal gradient and the ettingshaussen coefficient is the transverse thermal gradient produced by a longitudinal charge current .",
    "callen showed that the bridgman relation can also be derived from onsager reciprocal relations@xcite .",
    "he argued that in presence of magnetic field , eight thermomagnetic coefficients can be derived from six independent onsager coefficients , implying two unavoidable relations .",
    "one of these two is non - trivial and links _ isothermal _ ( and not adiabatic ) nernst , ettingshaussen and thermal conductivity coefficients to each other .",
    "this was the same equation originally derived by bridgman . in 1931 ,",
    "sommerfeld and frank had demonstrated its validity independently using a thermodynamic argument@xcite .",
    "onsager s reciprocity leads to thermodynamic constraints in relations between what he called forces and fluxes .",
    "according to the kelvin relation , measuring the ratio of the entropy flow to the particle flow is fundamentally equivalent to measuring the ratio of the potential gradient ( otherwise known as the electric field ) to the thermal gradient .",
    "in other words , measuring ratio of two thermodynamic fluxes is expected to give an information identical to measuring the ratio of the thermodynamic forces which generate them .",
    "the ultimate reason behind the bridgman relation is exactly the same .",
    "this can be seen by rewriting eq.3 ( assuming isotropic thermal conductivity ) :    @xmath11    in other words , the nernst coefficient is a measure of transverse entropy flow caused by longitudinal particle flow . as in the case of the seebeck coefficient ,",
    "this alternative definition provided by the application of onsager reciprocity is strictly identical to the ratio of the transverse electric field to the longitudinal thermal gradient invoked by the more common definition .",
    "this picture is particularly useful in setting a frame for the magnitude of the thermoelectric response linked to fundamental constants and material dependent parameters .",
    "let us now focus on the particular case of mobile fermionic quasi - particles .",
    "the two equations linking the three conductivity tensors , @xmath12(electric ) , @xmath13 ( thermal ) and @xmath14 ( thermoelectric ) , two flux densities , @xmath15(charge current ) , and @xmath16(heat current ) , and two driving vectors , @xmath17(electric field ) and @xmath18(thermal gradient ) are often stated as@xcite :    @xmath19    @xmath20    each diagonal and off - diagonal component of these three tensors is set each by one of the six independent onsager coefficients .",
    "a standard treatment using boltzmann equation considering the electric field and thermal gradient as perturbations to a fermi - dirac distribution leads to two independent relations between the three tensors@xcite .",
    "one of these two , linking @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a cornerstone of fermionic thermoelectricity and is called the mott relation@xcite :    @xmath23    in the drude - boltmann picture , the simplest expression for charge conductivity is :    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the concentration of the carriers and @xmath26 their mobility . in the past few decades ,",
    "a conceptual revolution initiated by landauer@xcite led to consider conduction as transmission@xcite . in this picture , an alternative transcription of this equation in two dimensions",
    "is :    @xmath27    eq.[drude ] and eq.[landauer ] are strictly equivalent since one can write mobility as @xmath28 .",
    "however eq.[landauer ] transparently states that electric conductivity is the capacity to transmit a quantum of electric conductance amplified or hindered by two material - dependent length scales : the distance electrons can go before being scattered ( @xmath29 is the man - free - path ) and their fermi wave - length , @xmath30 .",
    "in other dimensions , the numerical prefactor and the exponent for @xmath30 are different , but the picture is fundamentally similar .",
    "the thermoelectric counterpart of eq.[landauer ] was first discussed in the context of thermoelectricity of one - dimensional quantum point contacts by van houten _ _ el al.__@xcite , who argued that the mott relation should hold between @xmath21 and @xmath22 in one dimension . in two dimensions , using the mott relation , one finds ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of the expression in different dimensions ) : @xmath31    the new length scale introduced is the de broglie thermal wavelength :    @xmath32    in other words , the magnitude of @xmath33 is set by the quantum of thermoelectric conductance ( @xmath34)and three material - dependent properties , which are @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath35 . in absence of a well - established terminology",
    ", we will call @xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) the longitudinal ( the transverse ) thermoelectric coefficient .",
    "usually they are not directly measured by experiment .",
    "much more straightforward is to probe how the system responds to a quantified thermal gradient , which leads to a direct experimental measurement of the seebeck and nernst coefficients .",
    "the expression for the seebeck coefficient simply becomes :    @xmath37    the seebeck coefficient is a transport property .",
    "nevertheless , in the simplest conceivable fermi liquid , its magnitude does not depend on the distance between two scattering events .",
    "this is a consequence of callen s insight that the seebeck coefficient is a ratio of two onsager flows , and therefore , the ratio of the entropy of each electron to its electric charge .",
    "their entropy is set by how much the wavelength of a traveling electron can deviate from the fermi wavelength in the statistical distribution .",
    "we will use this picture in the next section to find what is the expected magnitude of @xmath36 .",
    "an intuitive window to the magnitude of @xmath36 , the transverse thermoelectric response , can be obtained by considering two more familiar cases . the longitudinal thermoelectric response ( the seebeck effect ) and",
    "the transverse charge conductivity ( the hall effect ) of the fermi liquids .",
    "longitudinal thermoelectricity arises when charged particles with a finite amount of entropy are simultaneously subject to an electric force and a thermal force ( see fig .",
    "1a ) . in a solid with mobile electrons ,",
    "the first is proportional to the electric field ( and the electric charge ) and the second is equal to the thermal gradient ( and the entropy associated with each electron ) . in equilibrium , these two forces cancel each other .",
    "therefore , the seebeck coefficient , the ratio of the electric field to the thermal gradient is also the ratio of quasi - particle entropy , @xmath38 to its charge , @xmath39 : @xmath40    now , the common expression for the seebeck coefficient of a fermi liquid is : @xmath41    are these two expressions equivalent ?",
    "the answer is affirmative . in a fermi - dirac distribution entropy available to transport",
    "is restricted to a thermal window , k@xmath42 t in the immediate vicinity of the fermi energy , @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to an expression of @xmath38 in terms of two length scales@xcite :    @xmath44    this is the origin of the equivalency between eq.[eq : sxx1 ] and eq.[seebeck ] or eq.[eq : sxx2 ] .",
    "let us now consider the hall effect ( fig .",
    "quasi - particles carrying both an electric charge , @xmath39 and a magnetic flux , @xmath45 , are subject to a coulomb force , ee@xmath46 , caused by a longitudinal electric field , e@xmath46 and a lorentz force , j@xmath47 generated by a transverse charge current j@xmath48 .",
    "the compensation between these two forces set the magnitude of the hall coefficient :    @xmath49    what is the magnitude of @xmath45 ? to answer this question , consider the drude - boltzmann picture of hall conductivity in a simple two - dimensional circular fermi surface :    @xmath50    this expression can be rewritten in terms of @xmath51 , material - dependent length scales and the magnetic length , @xmath52",
    ":    @xmath53    in the weak - field limit ( @xmath54 ) , as ong showed in a paper devoted to the geometric interpretation of the hall conductivity@xcite , it becomes simply :    @xmath55    combining eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmaxy ] and eq.[eq : sigmaxyong ] , one finds that the magnetic flux associated with each quasi - particle is : @xmath56    with these two cases in mind , let us turn our attention to transverse thermoelectricity .",
    "consider a system in which each carrier is a package containing both magnetic flux and entropy ( fig .",
    "such carriers can suffer a thermal force proportional to their entropy ( and the thermal gradient ) and a lorentz force proportional to their magnetic flux ( and the transverse charge current ) . in equilibrium",
    "these two forces cancel out .",
    "thus , the ratio of the transverse charge current to the longitudinal thermal gradient which generate it ( the definition of @xmath36 ) is equal to the ratio of entropy to magnetic flux of traveling quasi - particles .",
    "in other words : @xmath57    here , @xmath38 is the entropy of each carrier and @xmath45 its magnetic flux . using the expressions for @xmath38 ( eq . [ eq : sqp ] ) and @xmath45 ( eq . [ eq : phiqp ] ) , one can derive the following expression for transverse thermoelectric conductivity :    @xmath58    according to this equation , , the low - field transverse thermoelectric response is set by it natural units , @xmath59 , and three material - dependent length scales : the mean - free - path , the fermi wavelength and the de broglie thermal length .",
    "2 is summary of this very simple picture of quasi - particle transport .",
    "the transverse thermoelectric response is amplified by a long mean - free - path as well as the degeneracy intensity of the fermionic system .",
    "let us consider other sources for a nernst signal in presence of a superconducting ground state .",
    "the gaussian fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter are one such source . because of these fluctuations",
    ", short - lived cooper pairs appear above the critical temperature and in the normal state .",
    "the expected magnitude of their transverse thermoelectric response was first calculated by usshishkin , sondhi and huse@xcite :    @xmath60    here @xmath61 is the superconducting coherence length .",
    "this expression can be intuitively understood by considering that each short - lived cooper pair has an entropy of the order of k@xmath42 and carries a magnetic flux equal to : @xmath62    let us note that the cooper pairs , in contrast with quasi - particles , present a nernst response which does not depend on the mean - free - path .",
    "this is also true of their paraconductivity , expressed as : @xmath63    here , n@xmath64 the concentration of cooper pairs and @xmath65 is the ginzburg - landau time scale . unlike fermionic quasi - particles ,",
    "the landauer transmission factor does not depend on scattering time , but only on the pair lifetime , which diverges at the critical temperature .",
    "this time scale sets the temperature dependence of both the nernst response and the paraconductivity .",
    ".entropy , magnetic flux and transverse thermoelectric response in the case of different types of carriers . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     during the last few years , unexpectedly large oscillations of the nernst response was reported in both bismuth@xcite and graphite@xcite in the vicinity of the quantum limit . in both these systems ,",
    "when a few landau tubes remain , a large oscillatory nernst response dominates the monotonous background . in bismuth , the nernst response has a large phonon - drag component down to sub - kelvin temperature range . in graphite , on the other hand , it is mostly diffusive . nevertheless , the profile of oscillations are qualitatively similar ( see fig.[fig_bi_osc ] and [ fig_graphite ] ) .",
    "early studies both on bismuth@xcite and graphite@xcite had already reported on quantum oscillations of thermoelectric coefficients , but were not extended to low enough temperatures or large enough magnetic fields to detect the spectacular peaks seen when the magnetic field becomes a few tesla and the temperature goes below 1k .",
    "more recently , one has detected giant nernst oscillations in high - mobility semiconductors such as bi@xmath66se@xmath67@xcite , srtio@xmath68 @xcite and two systems believed to host massive dirac electrons , pb@xmath69sn@xmath46se@xcite and bitei@xcite . if stoichiometric , these systems are expected to be gapped semiconductors . however , the real samples are sufficiently doped to be pushed to the metallic side of metal - insulator transition and possess a sharp tiny fermi surface giving rise to a large oscillatory thermoelectric response .",
    "even if it was not known in 2007 , giant quantum oscillations in the vicinity of the quantum limit had been already observed decades before .",
    "one can find reports as early as 1959 on oscillations of the nernst coefficient with a large amplitude and low frequency in metals such as elemental zinc@xcite or aluminium@xcite .",
    "a similar observation was reported in the case of a degenerate semiconductor such as fe - doped hgse@xcite .    in two - dimensional systems , following the discovery of the quantum hall effect , several experiments on thermoelectric response were performed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "thermoelectric coefficients in the quantum hall regime have been studied both in silicon mosfets@xcite and in gaas / ga@xmath69al@xmath46as hetero - junctions@xcite .",
    "more recently , graphene has attracted tremendous attention as a two - dimensional electron gas displaying quantum hall effect .",
    "its thermoelectric response in the quantum hall system was subject a few recent studies@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of heterojunctions where the phonon drag contribution dominates the thermoelectric response down to sub - kelvin temperature@xcite , the thermoelectric response in graphene is essentially diffusive and even at 10 k , phonon drag is negligible .",
    "the thermoelectric response in a two - dimensional electron gas subject to a strong magnetic field has been the subject of theoretical investigations dating back as early as 1984@xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional case and its nernst quantum oscillations were subject of a number of recent studies@xcite .",
    "a number of empirical observations have been reported on the profile of the quantum oscillations of the nernst response . studying a two - electron gas in gaas / ga@xmath69al@xmath46as heterostructures , tieke _ _ et al.__@xcite found that the nernst response is proportional to the field derivative of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "in other words , the transverse response presents peaks which are shifted by @xmath70 compared to those seen in the longitudinal response .",
    "they provided a justification for this observation based on the mott formula .",
    "such a shift can also be seen in the case of graphene(see fig.[fig_graphene ] ) . as seen in the figure ,",
    "each nernst oscillation consists of a pair of negative and positive peaks sandwiching a vanishing signal .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical expectations@xcite .",
    "the nernst response is expected to vanish twice , at the center of a hall plateau and at the passage from one plateau to the next .",
    "in both cases , the hall mobility presents an extremum as a function of chemical potential .",
    "nernst quantum oscillations in graphite , on the other hand , present a very different profile . in this case",
    ", each oscillation has an asymmetric sharp peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_graphite ] ) .",
    "this empirical observation suggested a qualitative change in the transverse thermoelectric response in the passage from 2d to 3d@xcite .    in a theoretical work devoted to the field dependence of @xmath36 ( dubbed `` dissipationless nernst effect '' ) , bergman and oganesyan@xcite derived the following expression for two dimensions :    @xmath71\\ ] ]    here , @xmath72 is the fermi distribution of electrons belonging to the landau level indexed n. the field dependence of @xmath73 consists of sign - changing oscillations with an amplitude set by the quantum of thermoelectric conductance . in three dimensions",
    ", they found another expression :    @xmath74    in this equation , @xmath75 is the fermi velocity of the n - th landau tube . according to this latter equation , the three - dimensional @xmath36 should present asymmetric sharp peaks at each evacuation of a landau level , leading to a drastic decrease in @xmath75 .",
    "this theoretical prediction was in agreement with the experimental observation of the field - dependence of the nernst coefficient @xmath76@xcite .",
    "when the magnetoresistance is field - linear , @xmath76 is simply proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , experiment resolved temperature - independent crossing points@xcite , reminiscent of those predicted by theory@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_graphite ] ) .",
    "later studies on other three - dimensional solids brought more information and additional complications .",
    "giant oscillations of the nernst coefficient were indeed observed in doped semiconductors such as bi@xmath66se@xmath67@xcite and srtio@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "however , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_sto_osc ] , these oscillations do not consist of asymmetric peaks . as in the case of dhva and sdh effect",
    ", the temperature dependence of the amplitude of oscillations could be used to extract the effective mass of carriers using the lifshitz - kosevitch formalism .",
    "thus , as far as the experiment can tell , there is a clear qualitative difference between the profile of quantum oscillations of the nernst coefficient in compensated semi - metals such as bismuth and graphite and in doped semiconductors .    to explain this difference",
    ", two distinct possibilities can be thought of .",
    "first , in compensated metals , the hall resistivity remains much smaller than longitudinal resistivity .",
    "therefore , since magnetoresistance is field - linear , @xmath76 , remains within a good approximation proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "this is not the case of uncompensated systems in which the field dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath76 could be very different",
    ". the expected singularity in @xmath36 may not be directly visible in uncompensated dilute metals .",
    "another road to an explanation may reside in the fact the carrier concentration in compensated semimetals does not remain constant in the vicinity of the quantum limit . a _ quantitative _ explanation of the sharp asymmetric peaks seen in the magnetostriction of bismuth@xcite invokes this field - induced variation in carrier concentration , which is absent in uncompensated doped semiconductors .",
    "it may be that the additional carriers brought to the system to preserve charge neutrality play a role in generating the sharp nernst peaks each time the height of a landau tube@xcite is reduced to zero .",
    "future investigations and in particular a direct comparison of the profile of @xmath36 ( and not @xmath76 ) in different dilute metals would be instructive .",
    "in spite of the absence of a quantitative understanding of the nernst response in the vicinity of the quantum limit in different bulk metals , the sensitivity of the nernst effect makes it a very useful probe of landau spectrum . in the case of bismuth",
    ", angle - resolved nernst experiments has mapped the complex landau spectrum for the whole solid angle up to 28 t. this complex spectrum has been found to be in satisfactory agreement with theoretical calculations , pinning down the band parameters of bismuth with a high precision@xcite . moreover , the angle - resolved study led to the identification of the origin of the unexpected nernst peaks observed in an initial experiment@xcite .",
    "these peaks were due to presence of minority domains in a twinned bismuth crystal .",
    "this was revealed by comparing their evolution with rotation with those expected by theory@xcite for a crystal rotated by 108 degrees , the angle imposed by twinning in bismuth@xcite .",
    "a very recent report on the nernst coefficient in this heavy - fermion system points to a puzzle , which has yet to be figured out@xcite .",
    "uru@xmath66si@xmath66 is host to a phase transition occurring at 18 k and leading to the emergence of the so - called hidden order@xcite . in 2004",
    ", it was reported that the entry to the hidden order is accompanied by a sudden enhancement in the nernst response@xcite .",
    "this can be understood by taking into account the sudden decrease in the carrier concentration and the drastic increase in the carrier mobility in the hidden order . both of them contribute to amplify the nernst coefficient@xcite .",
    "one can destroy the hidden order by the application of a strong magnetic field .",
    "this destruction is concomitant with the suppression of the large nernst response@xcite .",
    "these experiments were performed in samples with a rrr of the order of 30 ( or a residual resistivity of about 10 m@xmath77 cm ) .",
    "recently studied new generation samples of uru@xmath66si@xmath66 which were much cleaner ( their rrr was 620 and 1080 ) .",
    "they found that in these samples , the enhancement of the nernst coefficient triggered by the 18 k phase transition is even more pronounced@xcite compared to the older generation@xcite(see fig.[fig_urusi ] ) .",
    "the low - temperature mobility is much higher in these new - generation crystals and qualitatively , the enhancement of the nernst coefficient with carrier mobility is conform to eq .",
    ". however , yamashita _ et al . _ observed also another enhancement of the nernst coefficient at t@xmath78 k ( i.e. above the superconducting transition temperature ( t@xmath79 k ) .",
    "this second enhancement was absent in the data on dirtier crystals@xcite .",
    "they attributed this to superconducting fluctuations@xcite and , noticing that the magnitude of the observed signal is much larger than what is expected for gaussian fluctuations , speculated about an exotic source of superconducting fluctuations .",
    "what is currently known about various sources of a nernst signal inspires us a couple of comments .",
    "first of all , one is inclined to compare uru@xmath66si@xmath66 with other superconductors , in which one has detected both vortex ( below t@xmath80 ) and fluctuating ( above t@xmath80 ) contributions to the nernst response . in all of them ,",
    "the fluctuating signal in the normal state is a high - temperature tail of the vortex signal . in the case of uru@xmath66si@xmath66 , on the other hand no vortex nernst signal has been clearly resolved .",
    "the contrast is visible by comparing the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_urusi ] with fig .",
    "[ fig_nernst_vortex_ybco ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_nernst_vortex_fesete ] .",
    "if superconductivity generates the large nernst signal detected above t@xmath81 , then one would have expected a much larger nernst signal below t@xmath80 .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "note that experiment has detected a first - order transition identified as the melting transition of the vortex lattice@xcite .",
    "therefore , the temperature range for the expected emergence of the vortex nernst signal is known .",
    "since there is no enhanced nernst signal in this range , any nernst signal by mobile vortices should be be much lower in amplitude than the signal observed by experiment above t@xmath80 .",
    "alternatively , to check a possible quasi - particle origin of the observed signal , it is instructive to compare the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_urusi ] with the case of bismuth ( see fig.[fig_bi ] ) .",
    "the nernst coefficient even in the cleanest uru@xmath66si@xmath66 remains well below what has been observed in the dirtiest bismuth .",
    "moreover , in both cases , the enhancement of rrr leads to an amplification of the nernst coefficient .    in section 3",
    ", we argued the magnitude of @xmath36 for a given type of carriers is set by the ratio of entropy they transport to the magnetic flux they carry .",
    "thus , quasi - particles with a long mean - free - path and a long fermi wave - length can generate a large @xmath36 exceeding by far what can be produced by either vortices or short - lived cooper pairs .",
    "the @xmath36 in uru@xmath66si@xmath66 peaking to 23 ak@xmath82cm@xmath82 ( at t@xmath841.65 k and b@xmath841 t)@xcite is indeed `` colossal '' compared to the highest value seen in a superconductor such as optimally - doped yba@xmath66cu@xmath67o@xmath85 , where @xmath36 peaks to 0.08 ak@xmath82cm@xmath82 ( at t@xmath8480 k and b@xmath84 12 t@xcite ) , but remains smaller than what has been seen in a bismuth crystal even a rrr as low as 65 ( @xmath86 120 ak@xmath82cm@xmath82 at t@xmath841 k and b@xmath84 0.1 t@xcite ) .",
    "these comparisons suggest that superconducting fluctuations are an unlikely source of a nernst signal as large the one observed in the normal state of uru@xmath66si@xmath66 .",
    "on the other hand , a scenario invoking quasi - particles needs to explain what happens at t@xmath87 to the fermi surface ( or more likely to one of its components ) in order to produce the enhanced nernst signal .",
    "there is no satisfactory answer to this question .",
    "however , a similar mystery exists in the case of prfe@xmath88p@xmath89@xcite . in this system , ordering at 6 k leads to an enhancement of the nernst response . at 2  k , well below the ordering temperature ,",
    "a second jump occurs in the nernst coefficient , which becomes as large as 60@xmath26 vk@xmath82 ( comparable to the peak value in uru@xmath66si@xmath66 with rrr=620 ) . in non - superconducting prfe@xmath88p@xmath89",
    ", this is undoubtedly caused by a sudden jump in quasi - particle mobility , suggesting that such a scenario can not be ruled out in the case of uru@xmath66si@xmath66 .",
    "let us briefly mention anomalous nernst effect ( ane ) , which has attracted significant attention in the past few years .",
    "this refers to the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) . in ferromagnetic solids",
    ", there is a spontaneous hall current on top of the normal hall effect .",
    "recent work has shown that this can be traced back to the presence of an anomalous velocity intimately linked with berry - phase curvatures(see nagaosa _ _ et al.__@xcite for a review ) .    following its introduction by berry in 1984@xcite ,",
    "the idea that tuning the geometric phase of a quantum state can lead to experimentally observable physical phenomena has deeply influenced the understanding of diverse phenomena in condensed - matter physics@xcite . in the case of bloch waves in crystals ,",
    "the berry curvature modifies the group velocity by introducing an anomalous term @xcite : @xmath90    in the absence of the second term in the right side of this equation , the group velocity , @xmath91 is set by the energy dispersion , @xmath92 of a band indexed @xmath25 .",
    "various transport properties of electrons in a crystal would be affected by the presence of a finite @xmath93 .",
    "the latter is called berry curvature .",
    "it can be defined for the bloch wave - function of a band indexed @xmath25 :    @xmath94    in the following way@xcite : @xmath95    when the @xmath93 field is such that its integral along a closed orbit remains finite one speaks of s non - trivial berry phase .",
    "this is a generalization of the physics of aharanov - bohm effect to a situation in which the phase difference is nor produced by a _",
    "real _ magnetic field , but by an _ effective _",
    "magnetic field described by the berry curvature .    in a theoretical study of ane ,",
    "xiao and co - workers@xcite argued that in spite of the fact that the force produced by a thermal gradient is statistical and therefore intrinsically macroscopic ( in contrast to the one generated by an electric field ) , a finite berry curvature generates an anomalous transverse thermoelectric response , @xmath96 .",
    "they found that the magnitude of the latter is linked to the the anomalous hall effect , @xmath97 , : @xmath98 this is the mott formula , the same which links the normal versions of the two effects in the purely orbital case .",
    "a number of experimental studies have been devoted to the ane in ferromagnetic solids@xcite . in two systems , the ferromagnetic semiconductor , ga@xmath99mn@xmath46as@xcite and half - metallic",
    "magnetite(fe@xmath67o@xmath88)@xcite , the measured values of ane and ahe were reported to be in agreement with the mott formula .",
    "one expects to see in near future many other nernst experiments probing electronic states with non - trivial topology .",
    "contrary to what one can still read here and there in scientific literature , the nernst effect is not negligibly small in fermi liquids .",
    "quasi - particles generate a nernst signal which can vary by many orders of magnitude in different fermi liquids .",
    "the largest known nernst coefficients are recorded in dilute metals hosting extremely mobile electrons . on the other hand , when the quasi - particle contribution is tuned to zero in the normal - state of a dirty superconductor , one can resolve a sizeable nernst signal coming from fluctuating cooper pairs .",
    "mobile superconducting vortices are another well - established source of a nernst signal below the critical temperature . finally , there are indications that squeezing a landau tube generates nernst peaks , which become visible in the vicinity of quantum limit .",

    "<S> the nernst effect is the transverse electric field produced by a longitudinal thermal gradient in presence of magnetic field . in the beginning of this century , </S>",

    "<S> extremely mobile quasi - particles in dilute metals generate a widely - documented nernst signal . fluctuating cooper pairs in the normal state of superconductors </S>",
    "<S> have been found to produce a detectable nernst signal with an amplitude conform to the gaussian theory , first conceived by ussishkin , sondhi and huse . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these microscopic sources , mobile abrikosov vortices , mesoscopic objects carrying simultaneously entropy and magnetic flux , can produce a sizeable nernst response . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in metals subject to a magnetic field strong enough to truncate the fermi surface to a few landau tubes , each exiting tube generates a peak in the nernst response . </S>",
    "<S> the survey of these well - established sources of the nernst signal is a helpful guide to identify the origin of the nernst signal in other controversial cases . </S>"
