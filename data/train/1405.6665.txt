    "quantum field theory in curved spacetimes has a broad range of applicability .",
    "it covers not only real gravitation , e.g. , the expanding universe and black holes , but also non - inertial reference frames , e.g. , accelerated frames and rotating frames .",
    "one of the most prominent quantum phenomena in curved spacetimes is particle creation from the vacuum .",
    "the particle creation occurs on black holes , in accelerated frames , and in the expanding universe @xcite .",
    "the understanding of such a quantum process at the full quantum level is a long standing problem .    despite enormous efforts ,",
    "the consistent quantization of gravity is still difficult due to nonrenormalizability . at energies below the planck scale , quantum effects of gravity",
    "can be neglected and gravity can be treated as a classical field . whereas quantum gravity is too difficult , quantum field theory with classical gravity is , at least in principle , tamable .",
    "practical calculations of interacting quantum field theory are , however , not easy even if gravity is classical , .",
    "in particular , in the strong coupling region of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , a perturbative approach does not work successfully . to study nonperturbative aspects of qcd",
    ", we need the lattice simulation , which is an _ ab initio _ nonperturbative approach in qcd .    in this paper , we formulate lattice qcd with external gravitational fields .",
    "the gravitational fields are classical backgrounds in this framework , unlike in lattice quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "while the backreaction from qcd to gravity is absent , quantum effects of qcd are exactly taken into account .",
    "lattice qcd in a curved spacetime was first formulated in a specific case of a rotating frame @xcite .",
    "we extend this formalism to general curved spacetimes .",
    "there are pioneering works of abelian gauge theory on curved lattices @xcite .",
    "in addition , some kinds of simulations in flat spacetimes can be regarded as simulations in curved spacetimes .",
    "the examples are an anisotropic lattice with direction - dependent coupling constant @xcite and an inhomogeneous lattice with coordinate - dependent coupling constant @xcite .",
    "we consider a four - dimensional riemannian spacetime with the invariant length @xmath0 the metric tensor @xmath1 has positive signatures . for simplicity , we assume that the spacetime is covered with a single global coordinate patch .    in the continuum , the yang - mills action is @xmath2 and the fermion action is @xmath3 \\psi\\ ] ] @xcite .",

    "they are related through the vierbein @xmath6 , which satisfies @xmath7 .",
    "the gamma matrix in curved spacetimes is given @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gamma matrix in the flat euclid space .",
    "in general , there exists the ambiguity of the choice for the vierbein and the dirac operator depends on it .",
    "we embed a hypercubic lattice into a spacetime where the gravitational field and the coordinate are fixed .",
    "thus there is no general covariance , i.e. , no local gauge invariance of gravity , unlike the dynamical triangulation in lattice quantum gravity @xcite . on the lattice",
    ", continuum spacetime symmetry is broken to discrete symmetries .",
    "for example , a hypercubic lattice has the symmetries of reflection , discrete rotation of @xmath10 , and discrete translation of @xmath11 .",
    "some of them are further broken by background gravitational fields .",
    "the full spacetime symmetry depends on @xmath1 .",
    "we here consider the hypercubic lattice with a single lattice spacing @xmath11 that is independent of positions and directions , i.e. , @xmath12 between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the @xmath13 link variable is obtained by discretizing the path - ordered product of @xmath14 , @xmath15 in this and the following equations , the contraction of the lorentz indices is not performed unless otherwise explicitly summed .    the building block of the lattice gauge action is the plaquette @xmath16 the shorthand notation @xmath17 means the unit lattice vector in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "we construct three symmetric combinations of the plaquettes , @xmath19 \\\\ \\bar{v}_{\\mu\\nu\\rho } & = & \\frac{1}{8 } [ ( u_{\\mu\\nu } - u_{-\\mu\\nu } ) ( u_{\\nu\\sigma}-u_{\\nu-\\sigma } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( u_{\\mu-\\nu } - u_{-\\mu-\\nu } ) ( u_{-\\nu\\sigma}-u_{-\\nu-\\sigma } ) ]   \\\\ \\bar{w}_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma } & = & \\frac{1}{16 } [ u_{\\mu\\nu } - u_{-\\mu\\nu } - u_{\\mu-\\nu } + u_{-\\mu-\\nu } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times [ u_{\\rho\\sigma } - u_{-\\rho\\sigma } - u_{\\rho-\\sigma } + u_{-\\rho-\\sigma } ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the plaquettes with negative directions are defined as @xmath20 etc . in the continuum limit , @xmath21 the lattice gauge action in curved spacetimes is @xmath22 .",

    ", we adopted the condition that it respects reflection symmetry ( apart from explicit symmetry breaking by the metric ) and has the smallest number of loops .",
    "as long as the continuum limit is the same , other constructions are possible .",
    "for example , @xmath28 can be replaced by @xmath29 but it has larger number of loops .    among several choices of lattice fermions ,",
    "we here consider the simplest one , i.e. , the wilson fermion .",
    "the wilson fermion action in curved spacetimes is @xmath30 \\psi(x_2 ) .",

    "( [ eqsflat ] ) between adjacent lattice sites is determined by requiring @xmath34 hermiticity of the lattice wilson - dirac operator @xmath35 . in the formalism of the wilson fermion",
    ", the so - called wilson term is added to the naive fermion action to kill the artificial poles of doublers .",
    "since the detailed form of the wilson term is irrelevant in the continuum limit , we added the usual wilson term which is the laplacian @xmath36 in a flat spacetime .",
    "we can use the laplacian @xmath37 although the lattice action becomes more complicated .    as in lattice qcd in flat spacetimes ,",
    "improved lattice actions can be constructed by adding higher - order terms of the lattice spacing , which are irrelevant in the continuum limit , to reduce discretization artifacts .",
    "in the euclidean path integral formulation , real time @xmath38 is transformed to imaginary time @xmath39 by the wick rotation @xmath40 . in euclidean quantum gravity ,",
    "the wick rotation causes serious problems , such as the conformal instability @xcite .",
    "most of the problems are irrelevant for classical gravity because they originate from the dynamical einstein - hilbert action and the diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "however , also in classical gravity , the wick rotation causes the complex metric problem .",
    "for instance , if @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is nonzero or if @xmath43 includes an odd function of @xmath38 , then @xmath44 is complex and thus the euclidean action is complex . also , if the connection is an imaginary number , the fermion action is complex . even if all the elements of the metric tensor is real , as in the minkowski space , the action can be negative and thus non - positive definite .",
    "when the total action is not positive definite , the monte carlo simulation does not work because of the sign fluctuation .",
    "this is called the sign problem .",
    "this is a known problem of a quark chemical potential and an external electric field @xcite .",
    "the fermion action with a chemical potential or an electric field is complex . in curved spacetimes ,",
    "the sign problem is more severe because both of the gauge and fermion actions can be complex .",
    "one approach to avoid the sign problem is to change the real parameter that makes the action complex to the imaginary parameter .",
    "this is the analogy of an imaginary quark chemical potential and a euclidean electric field @xcite .",
    "the real information in the lorentzian spacetime is obtained by analytic continuation .",
    "thus this approach is justified only when analytic continuation is validated .",
    "if analyticity is lost , for example in the presence of a phase transition , this approach is not justified . in numerical simulations ,",
    "analytic continuation is done as numerical extrapolation along the parameter .",
    "this extrapolation is expected to be reliable for small parameter region , i.e. , in weakly curved spacetimes .",
    "another approach is to utilize special symmetry to cancel the complex phase of the action . for the sign problem of chemical potentials and electric fields , there are several known symmetries , e.g. , isospin symmetry @xcite . for the complex metric problem , such symmetry is not yet known .",
    "in contrast to the first approach , the second approach is applicable to large parameter region , i.e. , in strongly curved spacetimes .",
    "an entirely different approach is stochastic quantization @xcite .",
    "although stochastic quantization for complex action is not fully understood , it is developing rapidly .",
    "the direct simulation of complex metric systems might be possible in the future .",
    "the ultraviolet divergence of quantum field theory comes from infinitely short length scale .",
    "when the gravitational field is classical , it has only fixed intrinsic scales .",
    "therefore classical gravity does not cause new ultraviolet divergences .",
    "actually , the continuum theory is known to be renormalizable in general curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "although there is no formal proof of the renormalizability by lattice regularization , the lattice theory is expected to be renormalizable .",
    "the lattice spacing is affected by renormalization .",
    "the renormalization of the lattice spacing is troublesome in curved spacetimes . in flat spacetimes , if the classical lattice spacing is homogeneous and isotropic , the renormalized lattice spacing is homogeneous and isotropic because it is protected by spacetime symmetry . in the curved spacetimes where spacetime symmetry is explicitly broken , even if the classical lattice spacing is homogeneous and isotropic , the renormalized lattice spacing can be inhomogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "a famous example is the renormalization of the anisotropic lattice action @xcite . on the anisotropic lattice ,",
    "the spatial lattice spacing @xmath45 and the temporal lattice spacing @xmath46 are different .",
    "since they are differently affected by the renormalization , the renormalized anisotropic ratio @xmath47 deviates from the classical value @xmath48 . in weakly curved spacetimes ,",
    "the renormalization correction may approximately be neglected . in a strongly curved spacetime",
    ", we need to find a ( perturbative or nonperturbative ) scheme to determine the renormalized lattice spacing and the physical unit .",
    "in addition to the quantum correction , the lattice spacing receives a classical gravitational correction . in a curved spacetime ,",
    "the invariant length is @xmath49 .",
    "the distance between nearest neighbor sites changes as @xmath50 .",
    "when we calculate a two - point correlator as a function of time or distance , we should use the proper time or the proper length @xmath51 .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate the computational implementation of the above formulation . for a simple and intuitive example",
    ", we consider particle production in an expanding space .",
    "the time evolution of a flat three - dimensional space is described by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath52 which is used for the cosmological model of the expanding universe @xcite .",
