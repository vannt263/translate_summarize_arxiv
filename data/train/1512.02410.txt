    "in an earlier work@xcite we derived core - level spectra for single free - standing graphene sheets .",
    "our derivations were based on a model used by langreth@xcite for the core - hole problem@xcite in the seventies .",
    "our theoretical results very well reproduced experimental results , both for pristine and doped graphene .    in the excitation process",
    "the photoelectron leaves the system and a core hole is left behind .",
    "the shape of the xps ( x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ) spectrum depends on how fast the process is .",
    "one may use the adiabatic approximation if the process is very slow . in this approximation",
    "one assumes that the electrons in the system have time to relax around the core hole during the process .",
    "when we derive the xps line shape we go to the other extreme and assume that the excitation process is very fast ; we use the sudden approximation . in this approximation",
    "the core - hole potential is turned on instantaneously .",
    "the electrons have not time , during the process , to settle down and reach equilibrium in the potential caused by the sudden appearance of the core hole .",
    "this results in shake - up effects in the form of single particle ( electron - hole pair ) excitations and collective ( plasmon ) excitations .",
    "the electrons contributing to the shake - up effects are the electrons in the valence and conduction bands .",
    "we use the conical approximation for these bands in which both bands have conical shapes for all momenta .",
    "we make the assumption that the core hole does not recoil in the shake - up process and that there are no excitations within the core .",
    "we approximate the core - hole potential with a pure coulomb potential .",
    "furthermore , the finite lifetime of the core hole causes a lorentzian broadening of all peaks and experimental uncertainties give a gaussian broadening .",
    "in many experiments one finds samples with more than one graphene sheet and the doping levels are often different in the sheets .",
    "this motivates the present work where we investigate how the core - level spectra in a bilayer system differ from that in a monolayer system .",
    "the sudden creation of the core hole in one layer is expected to cause shake - up processes not just in that layer but also in the other layer . to be more precise , the collective excitations in the two layers",
    "are coupled and the spectra are affected by single - particle excitations in the two layers and by collective excitations of the bilayer system .    the material is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ the ] we summarize the formulas for the core - level spectra derived for a 2d system in ref . [ ] and show how they are modified for a bilayer system .",
    "we furthermore discuss the spectrum of single - particle inter - band and intra - band excitations in the @xmath3-plane , and show how the dispersion curves of the collective modes are modified in the bilayer system .",

    "we have taken the finite life - time of the core hole into account by introducing the first factor of the integrand of eq.([equ1 ] ) , where @xmath16 is the fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of the lorentz broadened peak .",

    "if the doping is @xmath37-type electrons are filling up the states at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "this excludes some of the inter - band transitions since pauli s exclusion principle prevents electrons excited from the valence band to end up in these occupied conduction - band states .",
    "this leads to a depletion of the continuum above the @xmath31 line .",

    "new intra - band excitations occur where electron further down in the valence band can be excited into these now empty states .    .",
    "the solid blue curves are the two plasmon branches when the layers have a separation of 3.35  .",

    ". when the separation decreases the single particle excitation continua in the two sheets are unchanged .",
    "however , the coupling constants for processes where the excitations are a part change .",
    "this is , e.g. , important for core - level spectroscopy , addressed in the present work .",
    "the effect of coupling is even more dramatic for the collective modes . here , apart from the change in coupling constants the dispersion curves for the modes change . if the doping concentration is the same in the two sheets the dispersion curves for the plasmons in the two sheets are degenerate for large separation .",
    "when the separation decreases the two plasmon modes split up and the collective modes for the bilayer system will have two branches .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[figu2 ] where we show the dispersion curves for the collective modes for a graphene bilayer with two graphene sheets separated by 3.35  , both with a doping concentration of @xmath40 . when the two layers are far apart the plasmon dispersion curves ( red short dashed curve ) for the two layers are degenerate .",
    "when the layers are brought together the curves split up and form two plasmon branches ( blue solid curves ) .",
    "the curves merge with the single - particle intra - band continuum for large momenta or stop before that ; they may stop before merging since they are already inside a continuum , the inter - band continuum .",
    "the black solid straight line represents the upper boundary of the intra - band continuum . if the two layers have different amount of doping , for large separations the two plasmon dispersion curves are not degenerate .",
    "when the sheets are brought together the two branches of the collective modes of the bilayer system start out as the two single - sheet plasmon - modes but the closer the sheets come the stronger the coupling and the more the two dispersion curves are modified .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[figu3 ] for a graphene bilayer with the doping concentration @xmath2 in one of the sheets and @xmath1 in the other .",
    "now , the plasmon curves for the individual layers are no longer degenerate . when the sheets are brought together the sheets couple to each other and two new dispersion curves bracket the two individual plasmon curves .",
    "the upper branch follows very closely to the high - density plasmon curve and the lower branch is squeezed between the low - density plasmon curve and the continuum .",
    "it stays above the continuum for small momenta but merges fairly quickly with the continuum with increasing momentum .    in figs .",
    "[ figu2 ] and [ figu3 ] we have not discussed damping of the plasmon branches . it becomes more complicated when the doping concentration is different in the two sheets .",

    "distinct ( undoped ) plasmon curves only appear in the smaller @xmath33-region defined by the low density sheet . for our calculations here we do not have to bother with the damping and finding the dispersion curves .",

    "we have here concentrated on the peak shapes only and not on the position of the peaks . in each of the figures we present",
    "we have chosen a fix doping concentration in the sheet containing the core - level .",
    "we show the peak for a single free - standing sheet with this doping concentration as a reference peak .",
    "then we give the result when a second sheet , with the same or different doping concentration , is put close to the sheet containing the core - level .",
    "we have chosen the separation to be 3.35 @xcite in all examples .",
    "a larger value would give a smaller effect on the peaks and smaller value a larger effect .",

    ", we continue to increase the doping concentration in the sheet with the core hole , now to @xmath43 .",
    "the reference peak in this case has a well developed shoulder .",
    "when bringing in a second sheet with doping doping concentration @xmath41 actually reduces this shoulder . when the concentration in the second sheet is increased to @xmath42 very little happens . finally , when the concentration in the second sheet is increased to @xmath43 the shoulder is reduced further in a region of small negative energies but comes back up further down in the tail region .",
    "this example demonstrates a different and unexpected behavior and shows that it is difficult to predict the outcome .",
    "simulations are necessary .",
    "we have derived the formula for the core - level spectra in bilayer graphene and presented numerical spectra for a combination of doping concentrations in the two graphene sheets . in a real experiment with doping concentrations @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the two sheets",
    "the spectrum consists of the superposition of the two spectra @xmath45;@xmath46 and @xmath46;@xmath45 with the notation used in the legends of figs.[figu4]-[figu6 ] . when the two spectra are superimposed they should be shifted in energy relative each other by the fermi energy difference in the two sheets and by the difference in the interaction shifts . in the formalism we use",
    "one obtains the interaction shifts , @xmath14 , but we have refrained from giving them here because they are sensitive to the band - structure approximation . in the real band structure",
    "the valence- and conduction - bands deviate from conical for energies a couple of electron volts away from the dirac point where the bands touch .",
    "thus , the true location of the peaks is sensitive to deviations of the band shapes from conical .",
    "this is expected to influence the results more the higher the doping concentration .    when analyzing the results shown in figs.[figu4]-[figu6 ] we found that for the two first figures the tail to the left in the spectrum increased when a second sheet was introduced .",
    "in fig.[figu6 ] the opposite was found .",
    "one should keep in mind that the peaks are normalized in such a way that the peak maximum is put equal to unity , this means that an increase in small - energy shake - up processes will lower the values in the shoulder- and tail - regions .",
    "all the results presented here are for free - standing bilayers .",
    "when a bilayer is on a substrate the results may be affected both by screening from the substrate and by possible additional shake - up processes taken place in the substrate .",
