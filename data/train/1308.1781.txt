    "geometric study of coconvex bodies is motivated by singularity theory .",
    "the connections between coconvex geometry and singularity theory are similar to the connections between convex geometry and algebraic geometry .",
    "many local phenomena studied by singularity theory are local manifestations of global algebraic geometry phenomena",
    ". thus it would be natural to expect that many properties of coconvex bodies are manifestations of properties of convex bodies . in this paper",
    ", we prove a number of results of this spirit .    in the first subsection of the introduction",
    ", we briefly overview the connections of convex geometry with algebraic geometry , of algebraic geometry with singularity theory and , finally , of singularity theory with coconvex geometry .",
    "these were the main motivations of the authors , however , neither algebraic geometry , nor singularity theory appear later in the text .",
    "thus the following subsection can be omitted .      the theory of newton polytopes founded in 1970s revealed unexpected connections between algebraic geometry and convex geometry .",
    "these connections turned out to be useful for both fields .",
    "according to a theorem of kouchnirenko and bernstein @xcite , the number of solutions of a polynomial system @xmath0 in @xmath1 equals the mixed volume of the corresponding newton polytopes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the relationship between algebra and geometry contained in this result allowed to prove the aleksandrov ",
    "fenchel inequalities using transparent and intuitive algebraic geometry considerations @xcite , to find previously unknown analogs of the aleksandrov ",
    "fenchel inequalities in algebraic geometry @xcite , to find convex - geometric versions of the hodge  riemann relations that generalize the polytopal aleksandrov ",
    "fenchel inequalities @xcite .",
    "the number of integer points in polytopes is a classical object of study in geometry and combinatorics .",
    "the relationship with algebraic geometry has enriched this area with explicit formulas of riemann - roch type @xcite , has allowed to connect the ehrhart duality with the serre duality ( from topology of algebraic varieties ) .",
    "the integration with respect to the euler characteristic , inspired by the connections with algebraic geometry , has allowed to find a better viewpoint on classical results of p. mcmullen , simplify and considerably generalize them @xcite .",
    "connections with algebraic geometry led to important results in combinatorics of simple ( and non - simple ) convex polytopes , and had many more follow - ups .",
    "the theory of newton polytopes has a local version , which studies singularities of sufficiently generic polynomials with given _ newton diagrams _ at the origin .",
    "this theory connects singularity theory with somewhat unusual geometric objects , namely , newton diagrams .",
    "a newton diagram is the union of all compact faces of an unbounded convex polyhedron lying in a convex cone ( which in this case coincides with the positive coordinate orthant ) and coinciding with the cone sufficiently far from the origin .",
    "the complement in the cone of the given unbounded convex polyhedron is , in our terminology , a _ coconvex body _",
    "( except that it is also convenient to remove the apex of the cone from the coconvex body for reasons that will become clear later )",
    ". computations of local invariants in algebraic geometry and singularity theory have persistently led to volumes ( and mixed volumes ) of coconvex bodies , the number of integer points in coconvex bodies , etc .",
    "computation of local invariants is often reduced to computation of global invariants .",
    "let us illustrate this effect on the following toy problem : compute the multiplicity of the zero root of a polynomial @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the multiplicity of the zero root of the polynomial @xmath8 equals the number of nonzero roots of a polynomial @xmath9 that vanish ( i.e. , tend to @xmath10 ) as @xmath11 .",
    "the newton polytopes of the polynomials @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath8 are , respectively , the intervals @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the lengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 of these intervals are equal to the number of nonzero roots of the polynomials @xmath12 and @xmath8 ( the answers in global problems ) .",
    "it follows that exactly @xmath18 solutions vanish as @xmath11 .",
    "thus , in this simplest case , the multiplicity @xmath19 of the root 0 ( the local invariant ) equals the difference of two global invariants , namely , the lengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the intervals @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] .    similarly to this simple example , many questions of singularity theory ( local questions ) reduce to questions of algebraic geometry ( global questions ) . computing various local invariants for generic collections of functions with given newton diagrams",
    "reduces to computing global algebro - geometric invariants for collections of generic polynomials with given newton polytopes .",
    "a systematic development of the coconvex bodies theory became a pressing need when , several years ago , relationships between convex and coconvex geometry on one side , algebraic geometry and singularity theory on the other side , were found that are far more general than relationships based on newton diagrams and newton polytopes .",
    "for example , these relationships have allowed kaveh and khovanskii @xcite to deduce non - trivial commutative algebra inequalities from a version of the brunn  minkowski inequality for coconvex bodies ( this version follows from theorem a ) .",
    "computing hilbert polynomials of algebraic varieties and their local versions for algebraic singularities leads to problems of counting integer points in lattice convex and coconvex polytopes .",
    "we start by recalling some terminology from convex geometry .",
    "the _ minkowski sum _ of two convex sets @xmath20 , @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 . for a positive real number @xmath23 ,",
    "we let @xmath24 denote the set @xmath25 . by definition ,",

    "let @xmath26 be a closed strictly convex cone with the apex at @xmath10 and a nonempty interior . consider a closed convex subset @xmath27 such that @xmath28 is bounded and nonempty .",
    "then the set @xmath29 is called a _",
    "coconvex body_. when we talk about volumes , we may replace @xmath20 with its closure @xmath30 .",
    "however , for the discussion of integer points in coconvex bodies , the distinction between @xmath20 and @xmath30 becomes important .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath31 are coconvex sets with respect to the same cone @xmath32 , then we can define @xmath33 as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the unbounded components of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , repsectively .",
    "it is clear that any @xmath32-coconvex set can be represented as a set - theoretic difference of two convex bounded sets .",
    "this representation allows to carry over a number of results concerning the convex bodies with the operation @xmath39 to the coconvex bodies with the operation @xmath40 .    in this paper",
    ", we describe several results of this type .",
    "although the reduction from the `` convex world '' to the `` coconvex world '' is always simple and sometimes straightforward , the results obtained with the help of it are interesting because , firstly , they are related ( through newton diagrams ) with singularity theory @xcite and commutative algebra @xcite , and , secondly , they are intrinsic , i.e. , do not depend on a particular representation of a coconvex set as a difference of two convex sets .",
    "coconvex aleksandrov ",
    "fenchel inequalities also appeared in @xcite in the context of fuchsian groups .",
