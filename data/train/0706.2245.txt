    "in the early eighties of the last century , the evolution of `` h - normal '' post - agb stars has been quite well understood , e.g. @xcite and @xcite have presented evolutionary calculations for these stars . at that time , neither standard evolutionary calculations nor model atmospheres could explain observations of h - deficient post - agb stars .    in 1979",
    "the discovery of pg1159@xmath0035 , the h - deficient prototype of the gw vir variables , had shown the inadequacy of theory : the optical spectrum exhibits broad and shallow absorption lines of highly ionized species , e.g. and , indicating  to be much higher than 100000k . at this temperature regime ,",
    "the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) is not valid and thus , adequate fully metal line - blanketed nlte model - atmospheres were required  but not available .    in sect.[sect :",
    "tmap ] we describe briefly our nlte model - atmosphere code _ tmap _ , which has been developed over the last two decades and has been successfully used for the analysis of hot , compact stars .",
    "such analyses have continuously provided constraints for evolutionary theory and , vice versa , predictions from evolutionary calculations have inspired us to search for lines of unidentified species in uv spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in sect.[sect : pg1159 ] and [ sect : lsv4621 ] , we give representative examples for our analyses of h - deficient and h - normal post - agb stars .",
    "we use _ _ tmap _ _ , the tbingen nlte model atmosphere package @xcite , for the calculation of plane - parallel , chemically homogeneous models in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium .",

    "pg1159 stars are so - called `` born - again post - agb stars '' @xcite , i.e. after their departure from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and at already declining luminosity , they experienced a ( very ) late thermal pulse ( he - shell flash ) and returned to the agb . during the born - again phase , the entire h - rich envelope ( @xmath1 ) was convectively mixed @xcite with the intershell material ( @xmath2 , located between he- and h - burning shells ) and h is completely burned .",
    "the direct view on intershell matter ( at the surface now ) allows to conclude on details of nuclear and mixing processes in agb stars .",

    "our analyses of pg1159 stars revealed that their abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , f , si , and ar are in line with predictions from evolutionary models .",

    "an inspection of stis observations of the same objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that there is no increase of the ni abundance and thus , it appears likely that the s - process has converted even ni into trans iron - group elements .",
    "however , we do not have reliable atomic data to prove this .",

    "95% of these are identified .",

    "<S> spectral analysis needs the observation of lines of successive ionization stages in order to evaluate the ionization equilibrium ( of a particular species ) which is a sensitive indicator for the effective temperature ( ) . since stars with  as high as 100000k have their flux maximum in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) wavelength range and due to the high degree of ionization , most of the metal lines are found in the ultraviolet ( uv ) range . </S>",
    "<S> thus , high - s / n and high - resolution uv spectra are a pre - requisite for a precise analysis . consequently , we employed the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in order to obtain suitable data . </S>",
