    "<S> the results are summarized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : badd ] . besides indicating the inadequacy of perturbative udd for @xmath97 ps , two main features emerge . </S>",
    "<S> first , as predicted by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bound ] ) , the minimum error achievable by badd is mainly dictated by @xmath66 , largely independently of the total time @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> second , lodd performance is fairly sensitive to the timing constraint : for a fixed @xmath24 ( @xmath98 ps in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : badd ] ) , `` softening '' the constraint selects lodd sequences that outperform badd , the opposite behavior being seen if the constraint on the intended @xmath66 is  hardened  . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a badd protocol effectively optimizes over a set of lodd sequences where the timing constraint is only approximately met , consistent with intuition .    in practice </S>",
    "<S> , an important question is whether the performance of a dd scheme is robust against uncertainties in the underlying spectral measure : in particular , sequences adapted to a presumed @xmath99 need not be adequate for the actual @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> some illustrative results are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : effect - of - varying ] for sequences subject to the same timing constraint , but applied to a setting where @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , a smaller cutoff @xmath102 leads to smaller decoherence , but much more so for perturbative udd sequences . </S>",
    "<S> expectedly , the knowledge of the spectral density explicitly assumed in generating badd and lodd results in far better coherence compared to ofdd and udd , especially when this knowledge is precise ( @xmath103 ) or overestimates the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> comparatively , badd sequences appear to be more robust than lodd sequences when the cutoff is underestimated .    , vs. actual over presumed cutoff , @xmath104 , for the supra - ohmic gaussian spectral density ( @xmath92 ) corresponding to the exciton qubit . </S>",
    "<S> all sequences are adapted to @xmath105ps , @xmath106ps . </S>",
    "<S> varying the `` actual '' power law of the noise to @xmath107 and @xmath108 resulted in a qualitatively similar behavior ( data not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : effect - of - varying ] ]    _ discussion. _ our mathematical description has relied on the solvability of the dephasing spin - boson model in the limit of instantaneous control pulses , however we expect similar timing - induced lower bounds to exist under more general conditions . in principle , non - gaussian classical dephasing such as random telegraph noise could be addressed based on the exact solution presented in @xcite , whereas non - bosonic dephasing models of the form @xmath109 , could be tackled by matching the leading - order contributions in @xmath110 with the bosonic case studied here . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that bounded timing resources do _ not _ prevent the dd accuracy bound to be zero in _ special _ cases  such as `` monochromatic '' or `` non - dynamical '' baths ( @xmath111 ) , for both of which the length of the arc appearing in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bound ] ) vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , `` nilpotent '' environments , where powers of the bath operators in @xmath112 and @xmath113 vanish at some order , allow perturbative dd schemes to achieve perfect decoupling , as perturbation theory becomes exact . for more `` adversarial '' environments , where @xmath112 is not restricted to but includes single - axis decoherence </S>",
    "<S> , similar lower bounds must exist by inclusion . </S>",
    "<S> elucidating the algebraic features responsible for a finite vs. zero performance bound remains an interesting open problem with implications for quantum error correction in general . </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to pulsed control scenarios , continuous - time modulation subject to finite energy / bandwidth constraints has also been explored for decoherence control @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although , even for a purely dephasing qubit , finding the optimal modulation requires solving a non - linear integro - differential equation , it would be interesting to quantify the extent to which the extra freedom afforded by continuous controls may improve the achievable performance lower bounds .    </S>",
