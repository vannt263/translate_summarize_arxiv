    "then the number of null vectors of @xmath0 , including the zero vector , is @xmath33 which counts the number of distinct solutions in @xmath34 , including the zero solution , to @xmath35 note that for a fixed @xmath6 and a given realization of the sequence of rows @xmath36 , the numbers @xmath2 are nondecreasing as @xmath37 increases .",

    "we also study the rate of exponential decay of the probability that @xmath42 is a null vector .",
    "the probabilistic setting that we consider has the rows @xmath29 being independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with the law of a random vector @xmath43 .",
    "the problem has different flavours depending on the underlying law of @xmath44 , and several regimes have received considerable attention in the literature , including :    * the _ dense _ regime in which @xmath44 has order @xmath6 non - zero components ; the standard model studied in this regime has @xmath44 distributed uniformly over @xmath45 . * the classical _ sparse _ regime in which @xmath44 has order @xmath46 non - zero components . * the uniformly ( very ) sparse regime in which @xmath44 has @xmath47 non - zero components .",
    "the main focus of the present paper is regime ( c ) ( albeit our ` @xmath47 ' may be random for each row , and might not even have a mean ) ; in section [ sec : other ] below we briefly discuss other models that have been studied . in the simplest case , @xmath44 contains a fixed number @xmath48 of non - zero components ( the cases @xmath49 and @xmath50 have distinct behaviour from the case @xmath51 ) ; in more generality the number of non - zero components is randomly distributed according to a given _",

    "thus the absence of non - trivial left null vectors is equivalent to all column vectors in @xmath3 being expressible as a linear combination of the columns of @xmath0 ( with addition modulo 2 ) , or in other words , to there being a solution @xmath53 to @xmath54 for all column vectors @xmath55 . in the special case of @xmath50 , motivation for considering this question",

    "_ suppose that a tennis club is organizing its annual schedule .",

    "each player wants to play on a given subset of the days ; if there is not a match available on every one of these days , they refuse to pay the annual membership .",
    "each day , in order for nobody to be left out , an even number of players is required .",
    "each possible schedule satisfying these requirements is a left null vector mod @xmath40 ; the one with the most units achieves the maximal income for the tennis club . + _ randomized lights out .",
    "_ this is a variant of the game ` lights out ' @xcite .",
    "each of @xmath37 lamps can be either on or off , and there are @xmath6 switches , each of which is incident to a specified subset of the lamps , as given by the random matrix @xmath0 ; lamp @xmath56 and switch @xmath57 are mutually incident if and only if the entry at @xmath58 of @xmath0 is 1 .",
    "if a switch is toggled , all of the lamps incident to it have their status changed from on to off or off to on .",
    "one may ask whether all states ( i.e.  configurations of on and off lamps ) are accessible from the ` all off ' state by using some sequence of switches ( or equivalently , if the ` all off ' state is accessible from all possible starting states ) , and this is equivalent to the question of whether the column rank of @xmath0 is @xmath37 .",
    "+ _ the xorsat problem .",
    "_ this is a variant of the random satisfiability problem @xcite , where there are @xmath6 boolean variables which may be deemed true or false .",
    "each row of @xmath0 represents a clause built as the logical xor ( exclusive or ) involving those boolean variables corresponding to columns incident to this row , so the clause is true if an odd number of the variables incident to the row are deemed true . given a vector @xmath55 , finding a solution @xmath59 to @xmath54 corresponds to finding a truth - assignment for the boolean variables so that each clause @xmath56 is true if @xmath60 and false if @xmath61 .",

    "then @xmath70 is a null vector for @xmath0 if and only if the model returns to the initial state after @xmath37 steps .",
    "this may also be interpreted as a random walk on the graph whose vertices are @xmath45 and edges are present between those vertices that differ in a single component ; the event that @xmath70 is null corresponds to the walker being back in his starting state after @xmath37 steps .",
    "the general case , allowing other weight distributions , corresponds to a generalization of the ehrenfest model whereby multiple ` diffusions ' are allowed , i.e.   at each step several particles may change colour at once ; cf ( * ? ? ?",

    "the null - vector problem in the fixed row - weight case has received several treatments in the literature , and it is not easy to reconcile all of the existing results , due to differences in presentation and also differences in the underlying probabilistic models . one contribution of the present paper is to clarify some of these issues , including giving a rigorous justification that the results are unchanged under small perturbations of the underlying model .",
