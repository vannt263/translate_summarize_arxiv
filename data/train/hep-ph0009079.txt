    "the aim of this paper is to present a careful recalculation of the electromagnetic corrections which have to be applied in the analysis of low energy @xmath3 elastic scattering data in order to recover the hadronic phase shifts .    for these electromagnetic effects in @xmath4 scattering ( @xmath3 elastic and @xmath6 elastic and charge exchange ) two different approaches",
    "were developed : the dispersion theory method and a method using potentials for the hadronic and electromagnetic interactions in a relativised schrdinger equation ( rse for short ) . by this we mean an extension of the schrdinger equation to the relativistic domain .",
    "the dispersion theory approach was initiated by sauter @xcite .",
    "it was then extended by the nordita group .",
    "the final results for their corrections are given in tromborg _",
    "_ @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the same authors present a detailed exposition of the underlying ideas and point out their limitations .",
    "the potential theory approach was initiated by oades and rasche @xcite and applied in detail by zimmermann @xcite to an analysis of the then existing data .",
    "his final results appear in the landolt - brnstein tables on @xmath4 scattering @xcite .",
    "both methods have their shortcomings . in the dispersion theory approach",
    "the only contribution from @xmath7- and @xmath8-channel exchange which is taken into account is that from @xmath8-channel nucleon exchange . the rest of the unphysical contributions are omitted .",
    "ref.@xcite states : ` we are not able to determine or even estimate this term , which is of course a serious drawback of our method ' . for this reason , ref.@xcite makes it clear that the results of an analysis of data for the three measured reactions which uses the corrections given there can not be used to draw any conclusion about isospin symmetry violation .",
    "it seems that the fact that a dispersion theory method can not give absolute values of the electromagnetic corrections has not been sufficiently recognised .",
    "this is an unsatisfactory situation , particularly for the analysis of the large amount of data at low energies .    in the potential theory approach of refs.@xcite hadronic potentials",
    "were constructed via rses to reproduce the hadronic phase shifts .",
    "these potentials then were used in rses , containing also the electromagnetic potential , to calculate the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "the idea is that by this addition of an effective short range hadronic potential and the long range electromagnetic potential we can estimate the corrections reliably .",
    "the weak point here is the use of a hadronic potential in a rse .",
    "but it should be noted that + ( i ) the hadronic potentials are used only to calculate the corrections , not to calculate the hadronic quantities themselves ; + ( ii ) the potential model is the only method that can give a well defined separation between hadronic quantities and their electromagnetic corrections .",
    "it was indeed possible ( ref.@xcite ) to analyse the best experimental data of that time in an isospin invariant way , using energy dependent hadronic potentials .",
    "the main reasons for recalculating the electromagnetic corrections in the potential model approach are the following .",
    "+ ( i ) the results need to be extended to lower energies , where there is now a large amount of new data obtained at pion factories .",
    "+ ( ii ) the slight effect which a change of the hadronic input has on the electromagnetic corrections needs to be controlled .",
    "this has not been done by the nordita group .",
    "+ ( iii ) the effect of some fine details of the electromagnetic interaction , which might become important at the present precision of the experimental data , needs to be checked .",
    "this also is not contained in the nordita results .",
    "+ ( iv ) instead of the energy dependent potentials used in refs.@xcite we want to use energy independent hadronic potentials to calculate the electromagnetic corrections for pion laboratory kinetic energy @xmath9 mev .    in this paper",
    "we treat only the single channel problem of @xmath3 elastic scattering .",
    "it enables us to describe the formalism carefully and to provide a survey of the relative importance of the contributions to the corrections . in the next paper",
    "we extend the formalism to the two - channel ( @xmath10 ) case and give the results for the electromagnetic corrections which need to be applied in the analysis of low energy @xmath6 elastic and charge exchange scattering data .    in section 2",
    "we give a detailed description of our model for the electromagnetic corrections to @xmath3 scattering . in section 3",
    "we explain the method of evaluation of the corrections in this model and in section 4 we give the final numerical results for these corrections .",
    "for the purpose of calculating the electromagnetic corrections we describe low energy @xmath3 scattering by means of individual potentials for each of the partial waves which are used in relativised schrdinger equations ( rses ) .",
    "we therefore develop the model by motivating the construction of the rses and discussing the components of the potentials that appear in them .",
    "the point charge coulomb potential is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the distance between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the c.m . system .",
    "when the potential ( [ eq:1 ] ) is used in the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation , one obtains the nonrelativistic point charge coulomb amplitude @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 being the c.m . scattering angle and @xmath20",
    "the reduced mass of the @xmath21 system : @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 the masses of the proton and charged pion respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is the c.m .",
    "momentum of the @xmath21 system .",
    "the born approximation to the point charge coulomb amplitude is given by the expression ( [ eq:2 ] ) without the phase factor .",
    "to make the relativistic generalisation of these nonrelativistic results , we start from the one photon exchange ( @xmath26 ) no - flip and spin - flip amplitudes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , modified by the pion and proton form factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 respectively , and separate them into three parts : @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 \\,[w^2-(m_p+\\mu_c)^2]}{4w^2 } , \\label{eq:10}\\ ] ] @xmath39 the quantity @xmath40 is the total energy in the c.m .",

    "( [ eq:6])-([eq:10 ] ) are fully relativistic .",
    "we now note that the relativistic @xmath41 point charge amplitude @xmath42 in eq.([eq:6 ] ) is the born approximation to @xmath43 multiplied by the factor @xmath44 .",
    "it is thus the born approximation to the amplitude obtained from the rse @xmath45 the inclusion of @xmath44 in eq.([eq:11 ] ) gives the unambiguous relativistic generalisation of the nonrelativistic potential term @xmath46 .",
    "the factor @xmath47 when @xmath48 and increases as @xmath40 increases .",
    "the rse ( [ eq:11 ] ) is obtained in a more rigorous way by following the standard route from the bethe - salpeter equation , making a three - dimensional reduction , using only the leading part of the @xmath26 diagram contribution and converting to coordinate space .",
    "this is the method used in ref.@xcite ; the factor @xmath44 is just the quantity @xmath49 in eqs.(2 ) and ( 4 ) of that paper .",
    "the full amplitude @xmath50 obtained from the rse ( [ eq:11 ] ) is @xmath51 where @xmath52 the expression ( [ eq:12 ] ) is the point charge coulomb amplitude to all orders in @xmath53 .",
    "it agrees with the results in eqs.([eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) in the appropriate limits and generalises those results .    from the rse ( [ eq:11 ] ) one obtains the radial rses for individual partial waves : @xmath54",
    "the wavefunction regular at @xmath55 has the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by eq.([eq:13 ] ) .",
    "we shall now proceed to add other potentials to @xmath59 , so that the wavefunction regular at @xmath55 behaves as @xmath56 like @xmath60 the notation @xmath61 takes account of the fact that the extra phase shifts , as well as the added potentials , in general depend on the orbital angular momentum @xmath62 and on the total angular momentum @xmath63 .",
    "we now take the sum over all partial waves to obtain the full no - flip and spin - flip amplitudes @xmath64 , @xmath65 respectively and use the identity @xmath66 furthermore , as is customary practice , we remove the phase factor @xmath67 from both amplitudes ; this does not affect any observable .",
    "the result is @xmath68 @xmath69 with @xmath70 @xmath71 the potentials other than @xmath59 are sufficiently well behaved as @xmath72 for the sums over partial waves to be convergent .",
    "two photon exchange contributions give a very small correction to the @xmath26 amplitudes and can be neglected at the level of accuracy required for the present calculations .",
    "however , even though vacuum polarisation is of higher order in @xmath73 , it needs to be taken into account because it is of extremely long range compared with the hadronic interaction . for vacuum polarisation we used the standard uehling potential for point charges given by durand @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the electron mass . the explicit integral representation of @xmath76 can be taken from ref.@xcite . since @xmath77 is a potential of electromagnetic origin , we assume (",
    "as is done in the treatment of @xmath78 scattering ) that , when @xmath77 is added to @xmath59 in the rses ( 14 ) , the factor @xmath44 should multiply it as well . the tiny effect of the extended charge distributions on @xmath77 can be neglected .",
    "the vacuum polarisation amplitude @xmath79 is given with sufficient accuracy for the analysis of current @xmath3 data by the lowest order expression in eq.(12.2 ) of ref.@xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82    the next step is to explicitly separate from the phase shifts @xmath61 the very small phase shifts @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the partial - wave projections of the amplitudes given in eqs.([eq:7])-([eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:20 ] ) lead to the results @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the legendre function of the second kind . the expression in eq.([eq:23 ] )",
    "comes from eq.(8.2 ) of ref.@xcite . for @xmath91",
    "this result was checked by direct integration of the rses , integrating to 1000 fm because of the very long range of @xmath77 .",
    "the expressions ( [ eq:21])-([eq:23 ] ) are completely sufficient for these very small phase shifts .    in order to calculate the electromagnetic corrections ( which we do for @xmath92 ) it",
    "is necessary to construct potentials @xmath93 and @xmath94 which reproduce the phase shifts @xmath95 and @xmath96 with good accuracy up to @xmath97 mev .",
    "the phase shifts themselves are calculated from eqs.([eq:21 ] ) and ( [ eq:22 ] ) with the dipole form factors @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 where @xmath101 the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 are chosen to correspond to the measured charge radii of the proton and charged pion , which can be found in refs.@xcite .",

    "the radial rses ( [ eq:14 ] ) are integrated outwards from the origin , with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath105 or @xmath106 and the factor @xmath44 included .",
    "even though dipole form factors are used in calculating @xmath95 , we found that it is quite sufficient for reproducing these phase shifts and calculating the electromagnetic corrections to use the simple potential for gaussian charge distributions @xmath107 where @xmath108 since @xmath109 in eq.([eq:21 ] ) contains @xmath110 , it is the potential term @xmath111 , with @xmath105 given by eq.([eq:24 ] ) , that reproduces @xmath109 satisfactorily .",
    "for @xmath112 the numerator @xmath113 of @xmath114 does not appear explicitly in eq.([eq:22 ] ) .",
    "the potential term can be written as @xmath115 or as @xmath116 , with @xmath117 energy independent in each case , and the phase shifts @xmath118 and @xmath119 satisfactorily fitted .",
    "we checked that this makes an insignificant difference to the contribution of @xmath120 to the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "for convenience we therefore took the term in the form @xmath116 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath118 is proportional to @xmath25 near threshold and can be reproduced very well for @xmath121 mev by means of a very short range energy independent potential @xmath122 .",
    "we constructed @xmath123 and @xmath124 by adding together a very short range potential and a potential which has the @xmath125 behaviour for large @xmath12 characteristic of a spin - orbit potential and is modified for small @xmath12 to take account of the charge distributions .",
    "these three potentials are plotted in fig .",

    "]    if we now construct the total electromagnetic potentials @xmath127 and insert them in the radial rses of the form given in eq.([eq:14 ] ) , with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath128 , the wavefunction regular at @xmath55 has the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath56 @xmath129 here we have neglected higher order contributions in @xmath73 to the total electromagnetic phase shifts .",
    "the distances at which the asymptotic behaviour is reached are determined by @xmath77 . since the potentials @xmath130 have an @xmath125 tail one might think that they require integration of the appropriate rses to the largest distance .",
    "it turns out however that one can stop the integration for @xmath130 at a smaller distance than for @xmath77 .",
    "we now return to eqs.([eq:15])-([eq:17 ] ) and write @xmath131 the residual phase shifts @xmath132 , which arise because of the hadronic interaction , are usually called nuclear phase shifts , in contrast to the hadronic phase shifts to be defined later .",
    "we now use the identity @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 using eq.([eq:13 ] ) . the separation in eq.([eq:27 ] ) is made because the phase shifts @xmath84 and @xmath85 drop off slowly as @xmath62 increases and all partial waves must be taken into account .",
    "it is convenient to treat @xmath83 in the same way as @xmath84 and @xmath85 and to take the sums indicated in eqs.([eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:16 ] ) over all values of @xmath62 .",
    "if we work consistently to the lowest order in @xmath73 ( @xmath73 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , @xmath138 for @xmath139 ) , we can replace @xmath140 by @xmath141 the sum over all partial waves then yields @xmath142 @xmath143 with @xmath144 the electromagnetic amplitudes are defined in eqs.([eq:7])-([eq:9 ] ) , ( [ eq:18 ] ) and ( [ eq:20 ] ) .",

    "present experiments do not go to an energy as low as this , and the measurements are at angles sufficiently away from the forward direction that the lowest order approximation to @xmath79 given in eq.(20 ) is adequate .    for small angles and energies ,",
    "the leading correction to the lowest order approximation to @xmath79 is the imaginary part of the quantity @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is given in eq .",

    "the magnitude of the ratio of this correction to the lowest order approximation increases as the scattering angle decreases .",

    "the magnitude of this ratio is 6.6% at @xmath158 and it might just be necessary to take the correction into account at such a small angle .",
    "the final step is to introduce the hadronic interaction via effective hadronic potentials @xmath159 ( in the presence of the electromagnetic interaction ) which are added to @xmath160 : @xmath161 eq.([eq:33 ] ) implies that the hadronic potential term has the form @xmath162 . with",

    "it is equally possible to take the hadronic potential term as @xmath164 , with of course a different energy independent potential . for the @xmath3 case we checked that the values of the electromagnetic corrections are practically independent of the energy dependence of the hadronic potential term that is chosen .",
    "as we shall see in the next paper , this is not the case for the two - channel @xmath6 situation ; the choice of the energy dependence of the hadronic potential term has significant consequences for the values of the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "we shall defer to that paper a full discussion of this delicate point of principle ; for the present it is sufficient to note that , for the @xmath3 corrections , what energy dependence is chosen for the hadronic potential term is not important . in the calculation of the corrections given in section 4 we use rses with the form @xmath165 with @xmath166 given by eqs.([eq:33 ] ) and ( [ eq:25 ] ) .",

    "we emphasize again that the @xmath175 , as well as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , are needed only for the calculation of the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "once these corrections are determined , the phase shift analysis , using eqs.([eq:30])-([eq:32 ] ) and ( [ eq:35 ] ) , determines hadronic phase shifts without any further reference to potentials .",
    "we proceed in the next section to describe the construction of the hadronic potentials and the evaluation of the corrections .",
    "numerically we evaluated the electromagnetic corrections @xmath170 only for the three lowest partial waves ( @xmath176 ) .",

    "the hadronic potentials constructed in a ) can be considered as an auxiliary alternative parametrisation of the hadronic phase shifts which is used only for the calculation of the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "a very important observation of a conceptual nature needs to be made .",
    "we have called the quantities @xmath196 hadronic phase shifts , but they are obtained from a phase shift analysis which contains the _ physical _ masses of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the @xmath196 can not be considered to be strictly hadronic quantities .",
    "such quantities relate to a situation in which the electromagnetic interaction is switched off ( @xmath197 ) and therefore need to be obtained using the hadronic masses of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these hadronic masses are not the same as their physical masses ( indeed it is universally accepted that the hadronic mass of @xmath13 is very close to the physical mass of @xmath198 ) . in the same sense",
    "we have noted that the quantities @xmath159 are effective hadronic potentials in the presence of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "they would be different in the complete absence of all electromagnetic interactions .",
    "therefore in our present work , as in all previous work known to us , we avoid speculation about the strictly hadronic situation and give quantities that we call hadronic phase shifts and electromagnetic corrections which , though they have a precise definition within the framework of our potential model , are not the full corrections that would give truly hadronic phase shifts by subtraction from the nuclear phase shifts . any attempt to completely purge the experimental data of all electromagnetic effects",
    "would be very speculative .",
    "our aim is the more modest one of taking account of those electromagnetic effects that may be calculated with reasonable confidence .",
    "the final results for the three electromagnetic corrections @xmath199 , @xmath200 are given in table [ tab:1 ] from 10 to 100 mev pion lab kinetic energy .",
    "estimates of the uncertainties in the values of these corrections are also given in the table . in making these estimates",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between a ) uncertainties coming from applying our model and b ) uncertainties coming from the choice of the model itself .       in tables",
    "[ tab:2 ] and [ tab:3 ] we give ( at a smaller set of energies ) the various contributions to the corrections ( eq.([eq:11])).these components are additive to a very good approximation and tiny differences between the sums of the numbers in these tables and the complete corrections in table [ tab:1 ] are due to higher order effects .",
    "the corrections are clearly dominated by the component @xmath203 arising from the interplay between the hadronic and point charge coulomb potentials .",
    "the only other significant components are @xmath204 and @xmath205 near @xmath97 mev .",
    "our results are compared with those of the dispersion theory approach used by nordita@xcite in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "they have not included the vacuum polarisation contribution but we see from tables [ tab:2 ] and [ tab:3 ] that it is negligible for each of the partial waves at the energies we consider .",
    "the results of zimmermann @xcite , who uses a slightly different version of the potential model , are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we have added our values of the relativistic corrections to the results of zimmermann .",
    "we have indicated in fig.[fig:3 ] the uncertainties in our corrections at @xmath206 mev , as given in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "no errors are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the corrections presented there .",
    "for @xmath199 the results are in very good agreement , the differences being considerably smaller than the error on @xmath207 arising from the psa . for @xmath202",
    "our results agree quite well with those of zimmermann , which indicates the stability of the results obtained with the potential model .",
    "however , there is a systematic difference from the results of nordita , the discrepancy increasing with energy . at 100 mev",
    "the difference is about 2.5 times our estimated uncertainty in @xmath202 and over 4 times the error in @xmath208 arising from the psa . for @xmath201 our results agree with those of nordita at low energies , but at 100 mev the discrepancy is roughly twice the error in @xmath209 .",
    "however , since @xmath209 is very small , the corrections are of minor importance for the results of the psa .",
    "as we discussed in section 1 , the calculation of electromagnetic corrections using dispersion relations omits what could be important medium range effects due to @xmath7-and @xmath8-channel exhanges , which the potential model includes quite reliably .",
    "the differences of our results from those of nordita are probably due to such medium range effects .",
    "in particular the stronger energy dependence of the nordita results for @xmath202 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] is likely to be a medium range effect , perhaps due to their omission of @xmath7-channel @xmath210 ( @xmath211 , @xmath212 ) exchange .",
    "we therefore claim a higher degree of reliability for our present calculation of the electromagnetic corrections , compared with that of nordita . at the same time it is pleasing",
    "that the corrections in the @xmath3 case are very reliably known and are to a large extent independent of the model used for their calculation .      99 e. sauter , nuov . cim .",
