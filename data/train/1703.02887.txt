    "the hill problem is an useful approximation of the restricted three - body problem not to be confused with a particular case @xcite that , further than its original application to the computation of the orbit of the moon around the earth @xcite , can be representative of the dynamics of an object under the gravitational atraction of different pairs of solar system bodies . indeed , when using suitable units of length and time the hill problem does not depend on any parameter , and , therefore , its application to different scenarios becomes a simple matter of scaling @xcite .",
    "in particular , the hill problem is well suited by itself to study the dynamics about asteroids , yet it may need to be amended to include the important effect of the solar radiation pressure ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "but it can be used too in the description of the most relevant features of the dynamics around planetary satellites @xcite , a case that may require to further superimpose to the third - body dynamics the nonspherical disturbances of the central body , which can notably modify the orbital behavior close to the origin ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* for instance ) .",
    "the hill problem equations are useful also in the investigation of satellite encounters @xcite , and can capture the bulk of the dynamics of coorbital motion , with different applications to relative spacecraft motion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the hill problem has been thoroughly studied numerically by the propagation of periodic and quasi - periodic orbits @xcite , as well as escape trajectories @xcite .",
    "other studies provide detailed accounts of the dynamics , including the global description of the planar case for values of the energy corresponding to bounded motion @xcite . besides",
    ", due to its interest in spacecraft mission design , special emphasis has been given to the study of the stable and unstable manifolds associated to lissajous orbits , which can be effectively computed from the investigation of the center manifold of the collinear libration points @xcite .",
    "the global dynamics of the hill problem must be necessarily investigated numerically , although purely analytical approaches may provide useful information in those regions of phase space in which the motion can be considered a perturbation of the keplerian motion the normalized solution been commonly constrained to the close vicinity of the primary @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the normal form approach is not restricted to the case of perturbed keplerian motion and is customarily used in the computation of the center manifold of the libration points @xcite .",
    "this two degrees of freedom manifold is investigated numerically with the usual tools of non - linear dynamics , as poincar surfaces of section and the continuation of periodic and quasi periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "optionally , analytical approximations to the existing periodic orbits can be obtained with the lindstedt - poincar method @xcite ( see , also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively to the use of poincar surfaces of section , the dynamics of the center manifold can be approached analytically , at least for energy values close enough to the energy of the libration points .",
    "indeed , the center manifold hamiltonian of the hill problem has the form of a two degrees of freedom perturbed harmonic oscillator in the quasi - resonance condition , which is easily cast into the form of a perturbed elliptic oscillator by the standard introduction of a detuning parameter @xcite .",
    "then , the hamiltonian is rearranged in the form of an unperturbed term in the 1 - 1 resonance condition , whereas the terms that have been decoupled with the detuning parameter are incorporated into the perturbation .",
    "the dynamics of these classes of resonant systems can be efficiently approached analytically using perturbation theory ( see the recent review in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has been lately applied to the computation of analytical approximations of the lissajous and halo orbits in the restricted three - body problem @xcite .",
    "the former was approached by a standard double normalization of the center manifold hamiltonian in harmonic - type variables , whereas the computation of the later required a preprocessing of the center manifold hamiltonian in order to apply resonant perturbation theory @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lissajous transformation @xcite comes out as a convenient option to the customary use of harmonic variables in dealing with elliptic oscillators .",
    "it was specifically devised to deal with perturbed elliptic oscillators , and reveals particularly well suited to the construction of a resonant normal form hamiltonian by standard averaging over the elliptic anomaly .",
    "the normalized hamiltonian is of one degree of freedom and , after reformulation in the @xcite coordinates , provides a complete description of the reduced dynamics on the sphere @xcite .    in the present research",
    "it is shown that application of the lissajous transformation to the center manifold hamiltonian of the hill problem allows for the straightforward construction of an analytical solution for the motion about the libration points .",
    "the theory only accommodates the cubic and quartic terms of the perturbation expansion of the hill problem hamiltonian about the libration points , leading to an extremely simple normalized hamiltonian .",
    "the standard transformation that performs the reduction of the center manifold is provided up to quadratic corrections , and only short - period terms of comparable accuracy are computed in the normalization of the center manifold hamiltonian in lissajous variables .",
    "therefore , the practical application of the current theory is constrained to the lower orders of the energy for which these early truncations made sense .",
    "even so , the insights provided by this simple approach go much further than expected and the solution is able to capture the main features of the dynamics about the libration points .",
    "indeed , it not only shows the existence of the planar and vertical lyapunov orbits , which exist for all values of the energy above the energy of the libration points ; but it also shows the main bifurcations of these fundamental orbits , which occur for energy values considerably far away from that of the libration points .",
    "namely , the bifurcation which gives rise to halo orbits , and the bifurcation and termination of the two - lane bridge of periodic orbits that connects the families of planar and vertical lyapunov orbits .",
    "the construction of a higher order theory , which will notably improve the accuracy of the solution , is just a matter of mechanizing computations and is not discussed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first of all , basic facts of the hill problem , including information about the main families of periodic orbits related to the libration point dynamics , are recalled in section [ se : basics ] .",
    "next , the construction of the perturbation solution for the motion in the vicinity of the libration points , which consists of the reduction to the center manifold and the consequent removal of short period effects , is approached is section [ se : peso ] .",
    "it follows the discussion of the reduced phase space in section [ se : reduflow ] , where the equilibria of the reduced dynamics are identified with the main existing families of periodic orbits about the libration points .",
    "finally , some validation tests of the proposed solution are presented in section [ se : validation ] .",
    "in a rotating frame with velocity @xmath0 in the @xmath1 axis direction , the @xmath2 axis defined by the line joining the primaries , the @xmath3 axis completing a direct frame , and taking one of the primaries as the origin , the hill problem is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is position , its conjugate momentum @xmath6 is velocity in the inertial frame , and @xmath7 is the potential function @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the gravitational parameter .    after scaling units of length by @xmath11 and time by @xmath12 , the hill problem hamiltonian is rewritten @xmath13 showing that the hill problem does not depend on any parameter . in these non - dimensional units , the hamiltonian equations stemming from eq .",

    "( [ dpx])([dpz ] ) it is immediately apparent that planar motions @xmath15 exist , as well as the two equilibria @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is called the hill sphere radius , or hill radius in short .",
    "the two equilibria @xmath18 are customarily named libration points . due to the symmetries of the hill problem with respect to the plane @xmath19 ,",
    "it is enough to discuss the dynamics about just one of the libration points , say @xmath20 .",
    "the study of the linearized dynamics about the libration points shows that even though they are unstable equilibria , periodic motion originates from them in the form of small vertical oscillations through them , and planar oscillations around them @xcite .",
    "the so called vertical and planar lyapunov orbits are then grouped into natural families of periodic orbits which are parameterized by the energy , and are customarily computed by numerical continuation techniques ( see * ? ? ? * for instance ) .",
    "the stability of each periodic orbit is characterized by two parameters , say @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where orbit stability requires that both indices are real numbers with absolute value less than 2 , and bifurcations of new families of periodic orbits may happen when any of the indices crosses this level . the graphic representation of the evolution of these indices along the family",
    "provides useful information .",
    "thus , the stability curves of the family of planar lyapunov orbits is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : planarl ] , where the usual scaling @xmath23 is used rather than @xmath24 . because the orbits are planar , one of the indices is related to in - plane perturbations whereas the other is related to out - of - pane perturbations .",
    "as shown in the figure , planar lyapunov orbits are highly unstable , and three crossings of the critical value @xmath25 are observed .",
    "the first one occurs close to the energy value @xmath26 , where the halo orbits emerge ; the second crossing occurs for @xmath27 , the beginning of a two - lane bridge of periodic orbits which connect the planar and vertical families of lyapunov orbits .",

    "thus , even though the periodicity error when using initial conditions of the analytical theory is of the order of @xmath210 for @xmath209 , the differential corrections algorithm in @xcite only needs to compute four consecutive corrections to converge to a periodic orbit with a periodicity error of @xmath211 .",
