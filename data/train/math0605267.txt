    "typically , there will be exceptional fibres of @xmath5 which are not stable .",
    "the main technical issue of how to extend the map @xmath18 across the set @xmath12 of exceptional values is dealt with in section  [ sec : stab ] using the process of _ stable reduction _ of a family of curves .",

    "the stable reduction is obtained by pulling back the ( singular ) fibration @xmath0 over a new base @xmath21 so that the fibres are reasonably behaved . in this case reasonably behaved means that the local monodromy around exceptional values is given by dehn twists around disjoint non - parallel curves , which is equivalent to the homological monodromy being unipotent .",

    "theorem  [ th : decomps ] generalises to this situation in which the three - manifold now contains a link @xmath41 .",
    "since the main purpose of these ideas is to do be able to do calculations , this paper contains examples .",
    "a huge source of examples is supplied by polynomials in two variables @xmath42 . in this case",
    "the @xmath3 points on a generic fibre are its points at infinity .",
    "the stable reduction of a family is obtained by pulling back @xmath42 over a new base @xmath43 so that the homological monodromy around exceptional fibres and around infinity is unipotent .",
    "this fits in with the picture above if we compactify @xmath44 to @xmath45 and extend @xmath5 to a map from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",

    "thus , a polynomial @xmath7 gives a ( multi - valued ) map from the complement of its exceptional set in its base @xmath48 to @xmath36 and stable reduction allows us to extend over the exceptional set and at the same time choose a labeling of the @xmath3 points at infinity to get a rational homology class in @xmath49 .",
    "the jsj decomposition has previously been applied to polynomials in two variables in @xcite to introduce a powerful topological invariant of a polynomial @xmath7 , its _ link at infinity _ which is a link in the 3-sphere given by the intersection of a generic fibre of @xmath5 with the boundary of a very large ball in @xmath44 .",
    "this is analogous to the link of a complex plane curve singularity obtained by intersecting the curve with the boundary of a very small ball around the singularity .",
    "the link at infinity yields topological information about the polynomial such as the genus of the generic curve in the family , the monodromy around exceptional curves in the family , and possible exceptional curves that can arise in the family .",
    "part of this paper addresses the question of how much the link at infinity of a polynomial can say about its second rational homology class in @xmath4 .",
    "an effective description of the homology class associated to @xmath0 uses rational numbers obtained by evaluating the homology class on rational cohomology classes @xmath50 these cohomology classes are defined in section  [ sec : coh ] where explicit calculations of the rational numbers are given .",
    "the technique of stable reduction here is taken from @xcite .",
    "as described in the introduction , generic fibres of a polynomial map @xmath0 with @xmath1 are smooth genus @xmath2 curves containing @xmath3 distinct points .",
    "although exceptional fibres are not necessarily stable , the existence of the compactification @xmath4 means that as fibres approach an exceptional fibre they converge to a stable curve , so we may replace the exceptional fibre with that stable curve .",
    "this process , known as stable reduction , involves passing to a cover @xmath21 in which the local homological monodromy around each exceptional fibre is unipotent .",
    "the pull - back map @xmath38 will have the two important properties that every fibre is a stable curve , and that @xmath51 is the image of @xmath3 sections @xmath52 .",
    "such a cover exists by the local monodromy theorem which asserts that there exists a power of the local homological monodromy around an exceptional fibre which is unipotent with exponent 2 , i.e. @xmath53 . there are many such covers since any power of a unipotent element remains unipotent , nevertheless the way in which we define the rational second homology class in the moduli space of stable curves is independent of the cover .",
    "we decompose the cover into cyclic covers of prime degree since they are most easily understood .",
    "the process is best demonstrated via explicit calculations so this is what we will do next .",
    "the reader can consult @xcite for further details .      given a polynomial @xmath42 compactify to a morphism @xmath54 .",
    "this is achieved by first compactifying to @xmath55 .",
    "the map @xmath56 is not a morphism ( unless it was trivially a coordinate to begin with ) or in other words there are points in @xmath57 on which @xmath56 takes on every value and hence is ill - defined .",
    "thus we repeatedly blow up @xmath58 until the transform @xmath59 of @xmath5 is well - defined , and in particular there exist rational curves @xmath60 so that @xmath61 is onto , sometimes referred to as horizontal curves or quasi - sections .",
    "if the degree of @xmath61 is 1 for each @xmath62 then @xmath63 and the map @xmath54 has @xmath3 sections and the generic fibres become points of @xmath36 . if the degree of @xmath61 is @xmath64 for some @xmath62 then the inverse map @xmath65 is a multiply defined @xmath66 map .",
    "we must take a finite cover consisting of different choices of labeling the points at infinity meeting @xmath33 to get @xmath67 sections .",
    "we arrange this at the same time that we do stable reduction around a non - stable fibre .",
    "note that the fibre @xmath68 is never stable because it has components of multiplicity greater than 1 so we need to replace it .",
    "let @xmath69 .",
    "the generic fibre has genus 4 and 1 point at infinity .",
    "extend to @xmath55 and resolve the indeterminate points of @xmath56 ( explicitly , change coordinates to @xmath70 and blow up multiple times , or do a single toric blow - up @xmath71 , followed by a change of coordinates @xmath72 and another toric blow - up @xmath73 followed by another change of coordinates and multiple blow - up ) to get the curve over infinity represented in figure  [ fig : res ] by its dual graph .     over infinity ,",
    "height=75 ]    in figure  [ fig : res ] the nodes denote irreducible components , which are rational curves unless a genus is specified , the edges denote intersections between components , the self - intersection numbers are given in brackets , and the other numbers denote the multiplicity of @xmath59 on each component .",
    "the multiplicities and intersection numbers are related by the fact that a component has zero intersection with the fibre at infinity .",
    "the zero multiplicity on the right - most component denotes the fact that it maps surjectively onto @xmath46 , and in this case the map has degree 1 so it is a section .",
    "the dark node corresponds to the proper transform of the line at infinity in @xmath57 .",
    "the euler characteristic of the generic fibre can be calculated from the fibre over infinity by removing the points of intersection of irreducible components and taking the euler characteristic .",
    "thus a node of multiplicity @xmath74 and valency @xmath75 is replaced by @xmath74 copies of a @xmath75-punctured 2-sphere .",
    "the valency 2 genus 0 components contribute 0 to this sum which is @xmath76 so the generic fibre is a genus 4 curve minus a point at infinity .",
    "each fibre meets the section exactly once .",
    "the fibre over infinity is not stable since most of its components have multiplicity greater than 1 .",
    "all other fibres are stable in this example because the exceptional fibres , which are precisely the singular fibres , contain only nodal singularities .",
    "we will demonstrate the process of stable reduction which will replace the fibre at infinity by a stable curve .",
    "break the branched cover up into a sequence of covers of prime degree .",
    "take a 3 to 1 branched cover of the base totally ramified at infinity .",
    "the fibre over infinity in the pull - back fibration is not smooth since the original fibre over infinity is not smooth .",
    "for example , the cover @xmath77 is singular above the singularity @xmath78 , and we can resolve the cover using two intersecting @xmath79 curves . more generally we will need to consider @xmath80 for a @xmath5-fold cover near the intersection of curves of multiplicities @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it turns out that the normalisation of the pull - back fibration is the same as ramifying along curves over infinity of multiplicity not divisible by 3 .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig:3fold ] ramify on the curves of multiplicities 8 , 10 , 8 and 10 .",
    "the rightmost curve of multiplicity 6 in figure  [ fig:3fold ] pulls back to a 3-fold cover branched at its two intersection points with the multiplicity 8 and 10 curves .",
    "its multiplicity is divided by 3 . for the intersecting multiplicity 10 and 8 curves the 3-fold",
    "cover ramified along these two is singular .",
    "it is a hirzebruch - jung singularity which can be resolved . in this case",
    "it can be resolved by blowing up between the two curves downstairs to get a multiplicity 18 curve which is divisible by 3 , so we are reduced to the previous case of a 3-fold cover branched over 2 points , leaving a multiplicity 6 curve .",
    "the multiplicity 12 curve is branched over its two intersection points with multiplicity 8 and 10 and hence 3 copies of the multiplicity 6 curve live in the cover , sharing multiplicity 2 each .",
    "figure  [ fig : stablered ] shows the fibre over infinity of a sequence of base changes of prime degree combining to give a branched cover @xmath83 that pulls back the fibration so that the fibre over infinity is a stable curve .",
    "often the resolution of a hirzebruch - jung singularity contains a string of curves that can be blown down .",
    "we have not shown the full calculation . only once in figure",
    "[ fig : stablered ] have we shown the blow - downs preferring to combine steps and hide many intermediate rational curves .",
    "the process ends with the stable curve of arithmetic genus 4 given by two genus 1 curves attached to a genus 2 curve as in figure  [ fig : stableinf ] .",
    "this stable curve is canonically associated to the family in that any other cover leading to stable reduction will give the same stable curve over infinity .",
    "in the final diagram of figure  [ fig : stablered ] the cross with a 7 on an edge means that the intersection of the genus 1 and genus 2 curves is a @xmath84 quotient singularity obtained by blowing down a string of six @xmath79 curves . in the family of curves , parametrised by @xmath85 ,",
    "say , with @xmath86 corresponding to infinity , the nodal singularity is given by @xmath87",
    ". often we stop at the previous step containing strings of @xmath79 curves , and hence semi - stable fibres , to avoid singularities upstairs .",
    "of course if we take a further branched cover of degree @xmath24 say , the nodal singularity would be @xmath88 .",
    "it is clear that the factor of 7 is essential and the extra factor of @xmath24 is the result of taking a less efficient cover .",
    "the essential number is really @xmath89 , an invariant of the process .",
    "similarly , it is @xmath90th of the stable curve in figure  [ fig : stableinf ] that strictly replaces the fibre over infinity .",
    "this reflects the fact that the moduli space is an orbifold .        in the example",
    ", the curve @xmath1 is already a section . more generally , when there are irreducible components of @xmath6 that are not sections we need to arrange to have sections in the cover during the stable reduction process .",
    "in each step the @xmath5-fold cover is totally ramified at infinity and we can freely specify all other ramification .",
    "we choose some of the points of ramification away from infinity to coincide with the points of ramification of the map @xmath91 in such a way to remove the ramification .",
    "note that when the base is @xmath46 as for polynomials of two variables , we can also choose the ramification away from infinity so that the cover of the base is again @xmath46 .",
    "the result of stable reduction produces stable curves to replace non - stable exceptional fibres .",
    "when these new stable curves are included into the family there are usually singularities at nodes of the stable curves .",
    "the degree of the cover of the stable reduction must be remembered in order to get invariant quantities such as the homology class .",
    "the example demonstrates an algorithm for stable reduction that works in general .",
    "next we will prove theorem  [ th : decomps ] and apply it to deduce the stable reduction more efficiently .",
    "theorem  [ th : decomps ] is a special case of a more general theorem which we will now describe .",

    "for any exceptional fibre @xmath19 define the link of @xmath19 by the pair @xmath92 consisting of a 3-manifold @xmath28 containing a 1-manifold @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a small enough neighbourhood of @xmath19 .",

    "see @xcite for full details . in this particular case the multiplicities in figure  [ fig : splice ]",
    "are determined by , and determine , the weights in figure  [ fig : splice1 ] .",
    "+ given a polynomial map @xmath0 , we may assume the canonical class @xmath121 is supported on fibres of @xmath5 and sections .",
    "this is because any irreducible component of a divisor @xmath122 is either contained in a fibre of @xmath5 or it maps onto @xmath123 and in the latter case we can pass to a cover @xmath21 so that the pull - back of @xmath124 is a collection of sections , introducing new support only in fibres .",
    "let @xmath125 denote the support of @xmath126 and put @xmath127 .",
    "define @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "although @xmath130 resembles a divisor it is not really well - defined since we can add zero times any curve to @xmath126 and this will change @xmath130 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath130 is a useful tool to study the support of @xmath126 .",
    "the important property of @xmath130 is that for each @xmath131 @xmath132 where the valency of @xmath131 is its valency in the dual graph of @xmath125 .",
    "this expression vanishes on rational curves of valency 2 , precisely those curves hidden in the efficient dual graph . in particular @xmath133 uses only the multiplicities on the nodes of the efficient dual graph .    for a polynomial @xmath42 the multiplicities of @xmath130",
    "are easily calculated from the splice diagram .",
    "the node corresponding to the line at infinity in @xmath57 , indicated by the black node in the diagrams , has multiplicity 2 since @xmath126 has multiplicity -3 there . from any other node @xmath75",
    "take a path toward the black node to get to the previous node @xmath134 of valency @xmath110 .",
    "then the multiplicity of @xmath130 is given recursively by @xmath135 of the edge @xmath136 joining @xmath75 and @xmath134 , and @xmath137 is the product of the edge weights adjacent to @xmath75 and not on @xmath136 .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough description of the calculation of @xmath130 from weights in the splice diagram . in figure",
    "[ fig : splice1 ] the multiplicities of @xmath130 on the two valency 3 nodes are 5 and 3 respectively .",
    "another feature of @xmath130 is that it behaves well under branched covers . locally along a curve of ramification @xmath138",
    "the canonical divisor is given by @xmath139 , and hence a @xmath24-fold cover @xmath140 transforms @xmath141 , and along unramified curves the multiplicity remains the same .",
    "thus @xmath130 is given locally by @xmath142 transforming to @xmath143 so the multiplicity simply multiplies by @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ fig : splice3 ] shows how to decompose figure  [ fig : splice ] into pieces and how the euler characteristic decomposes .",
    "each node of valency @xmath110 corresponds to a seifert - fibred piece of the jsj decomposition of @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath144 on the arrow indicates that a fibre of the left piece consists of two identical disjoint components .",
    "the greatest common divisor of the @xmath145 on an arrow and the default value of @xmath146 on the right arrow is 1 which is the number of components of the fibre of the right piece .",
    "the numbers @xmath144 and @xmath145 are calculated using the weights of the splice diagram in the same way as multiplicities are calculated , by taking a path from the edge to an arrow and multiply all weights adjacent to , but not on , the path . thus the left piece has fibre two genus 1 surfaces each with one boundary component and the right piece has fibre a genus 2 surface with three boundary components .",
    "the genus 4 generic fibre with one point removed decomposes along two circles as shown in figure  [ fig : stable ] . by pinching along these circles , or vanishing cycles ,",
    "one gets the stable curve in figure  [ fig : stableinf ] .",
    "this demonstrates ( i ) of theorem  [ th : decomps2 ] . the decomposition in figure  [ fig : splice3 ] gives the jsj decomposiiton of @xmath95 into pieces @xmath147 each fibring over the circle and containing a multilink @xmath148 .",
    "the numbers @xmath144 and @xmath145 in figure  [ fig : splice3 ] are the multiplicities of the multilink components .",
    "the monodromy on the fibre of @xmath95 decomposes to give the monodromy of the fibre of @xmath149 .",
    "the latter has finite order given by the multiplicity of the valency @xmath110 component .",
    "this uses the fact that the monodromy on seifert - fibred spaces is completely understood .",
    "thus the multiplicity is 12 on the left component - this consists of an order 6 map on the once - punctured torus and a swapping of the two components - and the multiplicity is 10 on the right component .",
    "a 60:1 cover will pull back the monodromy to be trivial on each component and thus this will give the stable reduction of the fibre over infinity as seen in the calculation in section  [ sec : blowups ] .",
    "thus ( iii ) and part of ( ii ) theorem  [ th : decomps2 ] are seen .",
    "it remains to understand the twisting of the monodromy along the annuli in figure  [ fig : stable ] .",
    "upstairs , in the 60:1 cover we expect some whole number of dehn twists along the annuli , so downstairs we expect fractional twists . this calculation is subtler and it is completely solved in terms of the jsj decomposition as theorem 13.1 in @xcite .",
    "it is subtle only because we are choosing to emphasise the more intuitive multipicities of the polynomial @xmath59 on each component of the efficient dual graph , rather than the weights of the splice diagram .",
    "the fractional twisting requires the weights of the splice diagram .",
    "it is given along an annulus corresponding to the edge @xmath136 by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the number of annuli corresponding to @xmath136 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the multiplicities of the neighbouring nodes , and @xmath154 is the determinant of the intersection matrix of the nodes from the full dual graph lying on the edge . in the example",
    "above , @xmath155 , coresponding to the 2 annuli , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "( we have given the calculation of the edge determinant twice , the second using the splice diagram weights in figure  [ fig : splice1 ] , not explained here further . )",
    "thus the fractional twisting is @xmath89 and upstairs in the 60:1 cover it is a dehn twist of order 7 .",
    "this tells us that locally the node of the stable curve is given by @xmath87 and there is a @xmath84 quotient singularity in the ambient surface .",
    "in this section we evaluate the homology class associated to @xmath0 on rational cohomology classes @xmath50 since we consider 1-dimensional bases @xmath123 , we will abuse notation and treat the cohomology classes as numbers @xmath158 .    a non - trivial homology class in @xmath49 is detected by the non - vanishing of at least one of the cohomology classes above .",
    "this follows from work of wolpert @xcite where he shows that @xmath159 is a positive multiple of the khler class @xmath160 .",
    "the integral of @xmath160 over any non - trivial homology class is positive and hence at least one of @xmath161 or @xmath162 is non - zero on the homology class .",
    "there are obstructions to a dual graph appearing as the fibre at infinity of a polynomial @xmath42 .",
    "the obstructions are not complete so there are dual graphs where it is not known if they appear as the fibre at infinity of a polynomial @xmath42 .",
    "we do not know if the positivity condition @xmath163 gives a new obstruction on dual graphs .",
    "the class @xmath164 is represented by the boundary divisor @xmath165 .",
    "thus it counts the number of singularities of a polynomial @xmath0 .",
    "the contribution from a stable fibre is its number of nodes , where a node locally given by @xmath166 contributes @xmath103 to the count .",
    "equivalently , if we insist that the total space @xmath45 be non - singular and thus allow semi - stable fibres then the contribution from a semi - stable fibre is simply its number of nodes . the contribution from an unstable fibre",
    "is calculated by first passing to the stable reduction .",
    "in particular , the contribution is not necessarily an integer",
    ".    let @xmath38 be the semi - stable reduction of @xmath0 equipped with @xmath3 sections , for @xmath167 a smooth surface that @xmath24-fold covers @xmath45 .",
    "define @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the signature of @xmath167 and @xmath170 is the self - intersection of the @xmath62th section of @xmath171 .",
    "it is not hard to see that if we take a further cover the number of singularities multiplies by the degree of the cover and hence @xmath172 is well - defined .",
    "it is subtler that the signature behaves the same way .",
    "the signature of a branched cover is in general not easily calculated .",
    "the definition above is given for simplicity whereas for the purpose of calculations we give a better definition below in which the classes @xmath161 and @xmath173 in families @xmath174 and @xmath175 for @xmath176 .",
    "the relation between the two definitions of @xmath173 is due to smith @xcite and the others easily follow .",
    "the forgetful map @xmath177 is defined by forgetting the @xmath178st point and possibly blowing down rational components of some fibres .",

    ", one uses 1-forms holomorphic outside the singular set that have at worst simple poles at the singular points with residues summing to zero .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to enable calculations of the homology class of a polynomial map @xmath0 with 1-dimensional base @xmath123 and in particular , calculations of the rational numbers @xmath192 .",
    "we will calculate these rational numbers for infinite families of polynomial maps @xmath42 .",
    "we first do the calculations for the specific example @xmath69 .",
    "the contribution from the fibre over infinity to @xmath172 comes from the two nodes of the stable fibre over infinity , each counted with multiplicity 7 .",
    "the stable reduction is obtained from a 60:1 cover hence the contribution to @xmath172 is @xmath193 .",
    "this is the fractional twisting of the geometric monodromy and we have given it a cohomological interpretation .",
    "there are 8 finite singularities so @xmath194            we deduce the canonical class by the fact that it can be supported on the infinite fibre plus 59 copies of the fibre of @xmath5 .",
    "this is because the canonical class can be supported on the divisor at infinity @xmath195 since it can be supported on @xmath196 and blowing up introduces support only on the exceptional divisiors .",
    "a branched cover introduces canonical class along the ramification set so the 60:1 cover means 59 copies of the fibre of @xmath5 contributes to the canonical class and the rest remains supported on the fibre over infinity .",
    "apply the adjunction formula @xmath197 to a fibre to see @xmath198 so the section is given multiplicity 6 in the canonical class . to calculate the other multiplicities in figure  [ fig : canonical ] ,",
    "similarly apply the adjunction formula to irreducible components of the fibre over infinity .    thus @xmath199 and",
    "@xmath200 note that @xmath173 times the degree of the cover is an integer , so the relation @xmath201 puts a mod 12 condition on @xmath202 .",
    "finally @xmath203 is given by @xmath204=-b'\\cdot b'$ ] by the adjunction formula .",
    "thus @xmath205 the self - intersection @xmath206 used to calculate @xmath203 is encoded in the fractional twisting of the geometric monodromy .",
    "it gives the fractional twisting of the generic fibre on the annulus around the marked point . in terms of the efficient dual graph , or splice diagram , the annulus @xmath207 corresponds to the edge @xmath136 joining the fibre over infinity to the section .",
    "thus @xmath203 is given by @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the number of annuli corresponding to @xmath136 , and @xmath152 is the multiplicities of the node of @xmath136 .",
    "the formula for the twist is theorem 13.5 in @xcite .",
    "the example @xmath69 is a particular case of the general class of polynomials with one point at infinity .",
    "the splice diagram for the general polynomial with one point at infinity is given in figure  [ fig : stable ] .",
    "the stable reduction of the fibre over infinity is easily calculated from theorem  [ th : decomps ] .",
    "we refer to the node with weights @xmath211 as the @xmath62th node and the edge between the @xmath62th and @xmath212th nodes as the @xmath62th edge .",
    "the @xmath62th node corresponds to @xmath213 components of euler characteristic @xmath214 , each meeting @xmath215 of the @xmath216 components corresponding to the @xmath217th node .",
    "the monodromy permutes the @xmath213 components and acts internally with order @xmath218 , so its total order on the components corresponding to the @xmath62th node is @xmath219 which is the multiplicity of the polynomial on that node . thus the stable reduction uses a cover of order @xmath220 ( or more efficiently @xmath221 . )    from the fractional twisting along annuli we see that the quotient singularity at each annulus above the @xmath62th edge has order @xmath222 , and the self - intersection of the section in the stable reduction is @xmath223 .",
    "we calculate inequalities for the rational numbers @xmath224 since their maximum value is taken when the fibre of @xmath5 over infinity is the only unstable curve , and the rational numbers @xmath224 are upper - semicontinuous .",
    "we have no good interpretation of the messy expressions for @xmath172 and @xmath161 so we show them only for the cases @xmath225 and @xmath226 . for @xmath225",
    "the euler characteristic of the generic fibre is @xmath227 the stable reduction of the fibre over infinity uses a degree @xmath228 cover and results in a smooth fibre over infinity .",
    "to calculate @xmath172 we use a result of suzuki @xcite @xmath229 where @xmath230 which expresses the euler characteristic of the generic fibre as a sum of the number of vanishing cycles near exceptional fibres .",
    "if all fibres over finite values @xmath231 are stable , which is the generic case that gives an upper bound on @xmath172 , then @xmath232 counts the number of nodes in the fibre @xmath233 .",
    "thus @xmath234 the fractional twisting along the boundary annulus is given by @xmath235 so @xmath236 if all finite fibres are stable , the canonical class upstairs in the @xmath228-fold cover is @xmath237 where @xmath96 is the generic fibre and @xmath6 is the section .",

    "now @xmath247 and @xmath248 uses ( [ eq : suz ] ) to get an upper bound for nodes away from infinity , plus @xmath249 times the @xmath244 nodes over infinity , each counted with multiplicity @xmath246 .    to calculate @xmath161 we need a more efficient method than has been used so far .",
    "we use the divisor @xmath130 introduced in section  [ sec : effdual ] .",
    "the expression @xmath250 consists of @xmath133 which is independent of rational valency 2 nodes in the dual graph , and @xmath251 which does depend on rational valency 2 nodes in the dual graph , however it behaves well on the semi - stable reduction of a family .",
