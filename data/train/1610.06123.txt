    "deterministic discrete dynamical systems are often used to model physical phenomena . however , it is more realistic to consider random perturbations of such systems to take into consideration the observational errors .",
    "the behaviour of such random systems has been studied thoroughly in the last decades .",
    "we mention , for example , @xcite for excellent expositions on the subject .    laws of rare events for chaotic ( deterministic ) dynamical systems have also been extensively studied in the last years . by _ rare events _ we mean that the probability of the event is small . in the literature ,",
    "these notions were first described as hitting / return times statistics ( hts / rts ) . in this setting , rare events correspond to entrances in small regions of the phase space and the goal is to prove distributional limiting laws for the normalised waiting times before hitting / returning to these asymptotically small sets .",
    "for a nice review on the subject we mention @xcite .",
    "more recently , rare events have also been studied through extreme value laws ( evls ) . in this setting , rare events correspond to exceedances of a high level and one looks for the distributional limit of the partial maxima of stochastic processes arising from such chaotic systems simply by evaluating an observable function along the orbits of the system .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a review on this subject .",
    "it turns out that these are just two views on the same phenomena : there is a link between these two approaches .",
    "this link was already perceivable in the pioneering work of collet , @xcite , however it has been formally proved in @xcite , where freitas et al",
    ".  showed that under general conditions on the observable functions , the existence of hts / rts is equivalent to the existence of evls .",
    "these observable functions achieve a maximum ( possibly @xmath0 ) at some chosen point @xmath1 in the phase space so that the rare event of occurring an exceedance of a high level corresponds to an entrance in a small ball around @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the study of rare events may be enhanced if we enrich the process by considering multiple exceedances ( or hits / returns to target sets ) that are recorded by rare events point processes ( repp ) , which count the number of exceedances ( or hits / returns ) in a certain time frame .",
    "then the aim is to get limits in distribution for such repp when time is adequately normalised .",
    "very recently , the connection between evls and hts / rts for deterministic dynamics was extended to the random case through additive random perturbations in a. , freitas and vaienti @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this was the first paper to study the existence of extreme value laws in random setting .",
    "there we studied the additive random perturbation of expanding and piecewise expanding maps ( with finite branches ) and got standard exponential law .",
    "since then several advances have been obtained in this direction ( we will mention some of them below ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the random setting , there are two approaches for studying the recurrence properties of the underlying system . in @xcite , marie and rousseau defined , for the first time , annealed and quenched return times for systems generated by the composition of random maps . on the one hand ,",
    "in the annealed approach , we fix the realisation and integrate over all possible realisations to get the law . in this case",
    "we study the product measure for the skew - product system . on the other hand ,",
    "we take a random realisation , consider sample - stationary measures to study the quenched approach and get limit laws for almost every realisation .    in @xcite ,",
    "faranda et al .  studied the additive random perturbation of rational and irrational rotations and proved , using the annealed approach , the existence of extreme value laws for perturbed dynamics , regardless of the intensity of the noise whereas there is no limiting law in deterministic case .    in @xcite ,",
    "rousseau et al .  got an exponential law for random subshifts of finite type .",
    "they showed that for invariant measures with super - polynomial decay of correlations hitting times to dynamically defined cylinders satisfy an exponential distribution .",
    "they also got similar results for random expanding maps .",
    "their results were quenched exponential law for hitting times .    in @xcite , rousseau studied hitting and return time statistics for observations of dynamical systems and got an annealed exponential law for super - polynomially mixing random dynamical systems .",
    "this theory was applied to random expanding maps , random circle maps expanding on average and randomly perturbed dynamical systems .    again in @xcite , rousseau and todd proved the existence of quenched laws of hitting time statistics for random subshifts of finite type .",
    "they showed that it was still possible to get a dichotomy of standard vs non - standard exponential laws for non - periodic and for periodic points respectively , even in the random setting .",
    "one of the main achievements of this paper is the generalisations of the results in @xcite . as we pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "decay of correlations against all @xmath2 observables was one of the main ingredients in our theory .",
    "hence our theory was restricted to systems with summable decay of correlations against all @xmath2 observables with some additional conditions on the map .",
    "here we show that random perturbations of any dynamical system with a forward dense orbit defines an aperiodic harris chain which also satisfies doeblin s condition ( see proposition  [ prop : ran - per - aper - harris ] ) which gives rise to a uniformly ergodic markov chain .",
    "it is well - known that random perturbations are a special case of markov chains with suitable transition probabilities .",
    "recently jost et al",
    ".  in @xcite showed that markov chains with regular enough transition densities can be represented by continuous random maps or random diffeomorphisms . then , using the known results for such chains , we conclude that every dynamical system with a forward dense orbit under uniformly continuous random perturbation has exponential decay of correlations against all @xmath2 observables ( see theorem  [ mthm : trans->dc ] ) . with this approach",
    "we get laws of rare events for a larger set of dynamics , namely systems with forward dense orbit , under more general random perturbations .",
    "our work shows that evl and hts / rts for a large class of randomly perturbed dynamics is an application of the theory of stochastic processes / markov chains needing very little deterministic dynamical assumptions on the underlying unperturbed system .",
