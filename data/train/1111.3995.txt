    "common to the analysis of all of these experiments has been the application of the _ weak excitation approximation _ ( wea ) , where at most only one quantum is assumed .",
    "for example , ref .   suggested that their experiments were likely at the `` single photon level '' for less than 0.1 photons per cavity lifetime , so they applied a wea solution .",
    "the same assumptions are tacitly made by many other groups , in excitation regimes where the mean photon number is well below those associated with saturating the qd exciton  @xcite .",
    "these useful formalisms have been very successful and certainly help to clarify the basic physics of low - intensity photon transport .    for increasing field strengths",
    ", however , the validity for the wea becomes questionable , and there can be quantum nonlinearities in the system due to multiphoton correlations .",

    "most photon transport approaches also neglect the details of electron - acoustic phonon scattering @xcite  apart from the inclusion of a lorentzian decay rate for the exciton , i.e. , broadening of the the zero phonon line ( zpl ) .",
    "recently , several works have shown that coherent excitation of semiconductor - qd systems can easily go into the anharmonic cavity - qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) regime  @xcite .",

    "( @xmath2 ) when are multiphoton correlation effects important ( quantum nonlinear regime ) ? ( @xmath3 ) what is the role of electron - acoustic phonon scattering and how does this mechanism differ from a simple - lorentzian pure dephasing model ?    in this work",
    "we attempt to answer these questions for the regime of coherent photon transport , and show that generally one must include multiphoton effects and phonon scattering within the theoretical formalism . even for weakly - coupled qd - cavity systems , higher - order quantum correlations effects",
    "are shown to be significant .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ theory ] , we introduce the general theoretical technique to simulate coherent photon transport outside both the wea and the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the theory is based on a quantum master equation ( me ) formalism where cavity and dot decays are introduced by lindblad superoperators , and phonon interactions are included from an effective phonon me  @xcite that includes electron - phonon interactions at a microscopic level  derived using a polaron transform  @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ results ] , we first present calculations with no acoustic phonon coupling , for several different qd - cavity couplings ; both the weak coupling regime and the intermediate - to - strong coupling regime are investigated .",
    "we demonstrate that substantial deviations from the wea can result , even for very small mean photon numbers @xmath4 .",
    "we then modify the me approach to include the mechanism of electron  acoustic - phonon scattering , and study the impact of electron - phonon interactions on incoherent scattering and on coherent renormalization of the exciton - cavity coupling rate ; qualitative differences from a simple lorentzian decay model are found . as an application of the theory , we study the transmission of light in the strong coupling regime and simulate a conditional ( exciton - induced ) phase gate .",

    "we further note that because we are exciting through the cavity mode , the effects of the drive on excitation - induced dephasing are significantly suppressed , which is in this contrast to driving through the qd exciton  @xcite .",
    "finally , we study a conditional phase gate .",
    "we define the conditional phase through @xmath117 , where @xmath118 includes the dot resonance and @xmath119 is the phase without the dot . using a semiconductor micropillar system , conditional phase shifts of around 0.03  rad",

    "figure  [ fig:6](d ) shows the conditional phases , with ( solid ) and without ( dashed ) phonon coupling .",
    "near the spectral regions near @xmath120mev , about @xmath121 transmission phase change is possible _ conditioned _ upon the dot exciton being at the frequency regime  which can be tuned for example by applying a field - induced stark shift . in reflection ,",
    "conditional phase changes of around @xmath122 are found to be possible ; note that the one photon results ( i.e. , the wea ) tend to overestimate this value . including the coupling to the phonon bath is seen to qualitatively change the phase characteristics , and we stress that there is no effective @xmath15 which could mimic the same phase trends with phonon bath coupling ; the large negative phase of transmission actually widens with increasing @xmath15 , instead of narrowing then eventually disappears for increasing drives .",
    "the phase gate characteristics can be optimized further by changing the phonon bath temperature and by changing the exciton - cavity detuning .",
    "we have presented a semiconductor me formalism that can accurately simulate coherent input / output coupling of open - system semiconductor cavity - qed systems such as planar photonic crystals and micropillar cavities .",
    "we investigated the role of quantized multiphoton effects and pointed out the possible failure of the wea , which is shown to fail even for low input powers and small mean cavity photon numbers ( much lower than 0.1 ) . for increasing field strengths ,",
    "the possible failure of the semiclassical approach is also highlighted .",
    "we have further shown that coupling to an acoustic phonon bath causes considerable qualitative changes to the light propagation characteristics than is modeled by a simple pure dephasing process .",
