    "about 400 years have elapsed since the dutch chartmaker , mathematician and geographer willem janszoon blaeu recorded p cygni ( 34 cyg , hr 7763 , hd 193237 ) as a nova .",
    "it was discovered on august 18@xmath0 of the year 1600 when it suddenly reached 3rd magnitude .",
    "after remaining at its maximum for about 6 years , the brightness started to decrease and the star became invisible to the naked eye in 1626 .",
    "it reappeared in 1654 and remained at 3rd magnitude until 1659 .",
    "the visual magnitude of the star was variable between 1660 and 1683 and started to increase slowly until 5.2 was reached in 1780 . except for a few observations by herschel in the 1780s",
    ", there is no record of variations between 1780 and 1870 .",
    "since then p cygni s brightness has increased slowly by 0.4 magnitudes to bring it to its current value of v=4.83 .",
    "analysis of historical observations of p cygni has shown that between 1700 and 1988 its overall brightness slowly increased by 0.15@xmath10.02 magn / century ( de groot and lamers 1992 ) . the light curve of p cygni after 1600 ad is displayed in fig . 1 .",
    "the first spectra of p cygni , obtained as early as 1897 , already showed the famous p cygni - type spectral lines ( fig .",
    "2 ) ; an undisplaced emission accompanied by a shortward displaced absorption core ( maury 1897 ) . initially this was interpreted as a blend of two different lines .",
    "mccrea ( 1929 ) and beals ( 1930a , 1932 ) were the first to interpret p cygni - type profiles in novae , wolf - rayet stars and p cygni itself as due to a radially expanding stellar envelope .",
    "later investigations by struve ( 1935 ) , beals ( 1935 ) and struve and roach ( 1939 ) have shown that the outflowing matter is accelerated throughout the observed region since the lower - excitation lines , which presumably form in the remotest part of the envelope , systematically have the highest observed outflow velocities . early serious detailed analyses of p cygni s spectrum have been carried out by beals ( 1950 ) , hutchings ( 1969 ) and de groot ( 1969 ) . some identifications and",
    "measured equivalent widths from moderate - dispersion spectra were presented by luud ( 1967a ) .",
    "more recently , johnson et al . ( 1978 ) , stahl et al . ( 1993 ) and markova ( 1994 ) have published spectral atlases with identifications of many weak lines in the visual spectral region .",

    "the study of high - resolution and high - signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra has resulted in an abundance of information about the radial - velocity and line - profile variations of the spectral lines .",

    "the radio data , which directly measure the amount of ionized gas beyond the acceleration zone of the stellar wind , are able to provide a firm estimate of the mass - loss rate so long as the terminal velocity of the wind is known .",

    "/ wn6 , ofpe / wn9 , b[e ] , luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( fig .",
    "it is clear that all these classes represent different phases in the evolution of stars with zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) masses of more than 40@xmath2 .",
    "this is the least understood phase of the evolution of massive stars .",
    "though it is commonly accepted that massive o stars ultimately evolve into wr stars ( maeder and meynet 1987 ) , the details of the evolutionary connections in the intermediate phases are not yet understood . objects like p cygni ,",
    "@xmath3 car , ag car and s dor are ideal laboratories to be used to understand all missing links in the evolutionary chain o @xmath4 wr .",
    "a complete review of lbvs has been given by humphreys and davidson ( 1994 ) .",
    "note that the class of lbvs is not defined by some spectroscopic classification criterion and that , obviously , it may contain stars in different evolutionary states .",
    "the fact that several lbvs are located near the so - called humphreys - davidson ( hd ) upper luminosity limit on the hr diagram ( fig .",
    "3 ) suggests that very massive hot stars do not evolve into red supergiants but somehow reverse their tracks near the hd upper luminosity limit after a significant fraction of their mass is lost .",
    "the physics of the mass loss from lbvs is not yet understood .",
    "almost all lbvs , except p cygni , show moderate - amplitude cyclic spectrophotometric variability with timescales of years to decades .",
    "the amplitude of the photometric variability can reach up to 2 mag and stars can change their spectral type from early b to f. it is not yet clear what is happening with a star when it is changing its spectral type .",
    "there are some reasons to believe that the bolometric luminosity of lbvs may not be constant between minimum and maximum state .",
    "most curiously , some lbvs do not show a general correlation between mass loss and radius when they move on the hr diagram ( leitherer 1997 ) .",
    "however , all these conclusions must be considered as provisonal since the number of lbvs studied in detail during their moderate- or large - amplitide excursions on the h - r diagram is very small .    though p cygni and @xmath3 car are the first lbvs known , later discoveries of other lbvs , e.g. s dor and ag car ,",
    "has shown that the former are not really representative of the class .",
    "while both should be classified as lbvs - massive stars ( @xmath5 ) in a critical phase of their post main - sequence evolution when they become unstable and may eject a significant fraction of their mass in a relatively short time - they do not share many properties .",
    "the properties of @xmath3 car have been the subject of a recent review paper by davidson and humphreys ( 1997 ) .",
    "we feel it necessary to restore some balance by presenting another review paper which summarises our knowledge about another enigmatic object : p~ cygni .",
    "in their review paper , humphreys and davidson ( 1994 ) have used the term _ astronomical geyser _ to describe highly unstable processes going on in the atmospheres of @xmath3 car , p cygni , s dor , ag car and other lbvs .",
    "indeed , there is a similarity with volcanic geysers : moderate activity followed by violent burbling , then the huge eruption followed by relative quiescence .",
    "only four lbvs , specifically @xmath3 car , p cygni , v12 in ngc 2403 , sn 1961v , have had _ giant _ eruptions in which the star brightened by more than two magnitudes . more than one solar mass can be ejected during these giant eruptions which may last for decades . the fact that only four lbvs have passed through the giant - eruption phase can be interpreted in different ways .",
    "it is possible that the time interval between giant eruptions is very long ( centuries ) and that not all lbvs have yet experienced them .",
    "another possibility is that not all lbvs show giant eruptions .",
    "however , ag car , hr car and r127 may have had giant eruptions as is evidenced by the presence of massive and extended nebulosities around them ( humphreys and davidson 1994 ; nota et al .",
    "1995 ) . using the number of known lbvs and the number of known eruptions",
    "one can estimate a time - scale of giant eruptions @xmath6 10@xmath7 years .",
    "it is interesting to compare p cygni s and @xmath3 car s environments .",
    "both stars have experienced dramatic outbursts a few hundred years ago .",
    "the homunculus of @xmath3 car , formed by ejecta of the giant eruption that was observed between 1830 and 1860 , is one of the most colourful bipolar nebulae known .",
    "p cygni s nebula , on the other hand , is spherically symmetric and hardly observable at optical wavelengths ( leitherer and zickgraf 1987 ; johnson et al .",
    "recently , it has been resolved by imaging ( barlow et al .",
    "1994 ; nota et al .",
    "1995 ; meaburn et al .",
    "the question is : why do these two lbvs , @xmath3 car and p cygni , have such very different nebulae ? could it be that their giant eruptions are governed by different physics ?",
    "no other lbv is similar either to p cygni or to @xmath3 car . the only reasons which make us place these two objects into the same evolutionary group are their locations on the hr diagram and the giant eruptions they have experienced .",
    "is this similarity enough to claim convincingly that both stars are in the same evolutionary state ?",
    "our understanding of the physics of giant eruptions is based primarily on historical observations . in the years after the 17th - century eruptions , and aided by the increased use of telescopes at that time , many observers provided estimates of p cygni s brightness .",
    "of course , for the first three centuries after ad 1600 these were visual estimates made with or without a telescope and by many different observers . as a result , these early photometric data are not very homogeneous .",
    "however , quite an extensive record of these observations has been assembled by the authors of the various issues of the `` geschichte und literatur des lichtwechsels der veraenderlichen sterne '' ( mller and hartwig 1918 ; prager 1936 ; schneller 1957 ) .",
    "a number of additional observations between 1596 and 1917 is given by zinner ( 1926 ) .",
    "from all these records a fairly accurate picture of p cygni s secular photometric history can be reconstructed .",
    "the brightness of the star went through deep minima after the two outbursts in 1600 and 1655 ad ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the matter ejected in the major outbursts most likely condensed into dust rings which expanded into space .",
    "the reddish colour of p cygni during the outbursts has been recorded by several observers . however",
    ", various uncertainties do not allow us to distinguish between a circumstellar and an intrinsic origin of this colour .",
    "in other words , the historical observations do not provide enough evidence to check whether the star had the same m@xmath8 as at present or whether it was much brighter .",
    "two possibilities have been suggested by lamers and de groot ( 1992 ) .",
    "if the mass loss was high during the outburst in 1600 ad , then the reddish colour observed at that time could have been due to the large circumstellar reddening and the larger value ( at least one magnitude ) of the bolometric magnitude .",
    "however , if the circumstellar extinction was small during the outbursts , the observed colour would indicate an effective temperature as low as 5500 k , if the bolometric magnitude of the star was the same as the present value .",
    "it is very important to answer the following question : can a lbv like p cygni evolve down to @xmath9 = 5500 k or must it stop near 800010000 k as many other lbvs do during their excursions on the hr diagram ?",
    "it is believed that lbvs at their maximum do not pass beyond the opaque - wind limit ( davidson 1987 ) because the opacity in the envelope decreases drastically below t@xmath10 8000 k due to hydrogen recombination .",
    "langer et al . ( 1994 ) suggested that lbvs never become cooler than about 10000 k because of the large mass loss near the instability limit .",
    "it is not yet clear which physical processes are responsible for giant eruptions in lbvs and we can not rule out the possibility that different mechanisms work in different stars depending on rotation , luminosity , etc .",
    "the giant eruption of @xmath3 car took place between 1830 and 1860 when the star increased its total luminosity reaching m@xmath11 .",
    "it remained of the first magnitude for 20 years and then faded down to 8th magnitude .",
    "as from 1935 it has been brightening to its current value v@xmath6 5.2 mag ( van genderen et al .",
    "1994 ; iauc 7146 ) . the luminous energy released during the great eruption",
    "( @xmath6 10@xmath12 ergs ) was about the same as in a supernova explosion .",
    "this eruption was more dramatic then the one observed in p cygni .",
    "furthermore , the eruptions of p cygni and @xmath3 car have produced different types of nebulae ( nota et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 car is more luminous than p cygni does not seem to provide the full answer .",
    "more likely it has something to do with the geometry ( binarity , magnetic fields , interacting winds ? ) .",
    "therefore , to the question raised by davidson and humphreys ( 1997 ) `` _ is eta really an lbv ? _ '' we can add another one : `` _ is p cygni really an lbv ? _ '' .",
    "indeed , according to nota et al .",
    "( 1995 ) @xmath3 car s bipolar nebula shares the morphological class of _ shell nebulae _ with many other lbvs while p cygni is the only object in the class of _ peculiar morphologies_.",
    "so , in this respect , p cygni is even more peculiar than @xmath3 car .",
    "this fact suggests that different physical processes would have caused the giant eruptions of these two lbvs .",
    "it is believed that some sort of pulsational instability is driving an extra mass loss that later appears as a giant eruption .",
    "recently , langer et al . (",
    "1994 ) have discovered a phase of violent radial pulsations when a very massive ( @xmath13 ) shell - h burning star evolves away from the main - sequence and its effective temperature drops below 20000 k. their calculations show that a star with m@xmath14 = 60 @xmath2 may lose 5@xmath15 yr@xmath16 near @xmath17 k and will evolve again to hotter temperatures when about 6@xmath2 has been lost .",
    "however , it is not clear whether such pulsations occur in stars with enhanced mass loss ( either giant or moderate eruptions ) and @xmath18 k ( e.g. lbvs ) .",
    "it is known that all normal lbvs , i.e. with the exception of p cyg and @xmath3 car whose photometric variations are of much smaller amplitude , show moderate photometric variability with @xmath19 12 mag .",
    "recently , van genderen et al . (",
    "1997 ) have introduced the concept of `` s dor phases '' ( sd ) , phases of brightening with an almost regular pattern of recurrence .",
    "they suggested a new nomenclature discerning between `` normal s dor phases '' superimposed on a much slower gradient of brightening and fading for which they introduced the term `` very - long term s dor phase '' ( vlt - sd ) .",
    "the presence in lbvs of two distinct oscillation time - scales may have a strong impact upon studies of pulsation , stability and evolution of stars near the hd limit .",
    "an important step towards our understanding of the evolution of massive stars was the discovery of a steady increase in p cygni s visual brightness between 1700 and 1988 ( de groot and lamers 1992 ; lamers and de groot 1992 ) .",
    "evaluation of p cygni s brightness during the period 1700 - 2000 is a difficult task because the historical observations are based on a variety of early photometric detectors and different filters . assuming a constant luminosity during the last three centuries , these authors have shown that the increase in brightness of 0.15@xmath10.02 mag / century is caused by a steady decrease of the bolometric correction in agreement with calculations based on the theory of stellar evolution .",
    "this means that p cygni has been moving to the red on the hr diagram changing its @xmath9 at a rate of 6@xmath11 percent per century .",
    "clearly , p cygni is the first massive star whose long - term , steady photometric changes have been shown to be caused by evolutionary effects .      as for p cygni s photometric behaviour on shorter time - scales , reports in the older ( i.e. pre-1930 ) literature are almost unanimous in saying that the star is essentially non - variable : safarik ( 1888 ) , e.g. , reports p cygni as `` just about constant '' on 17 nights between july 1884 and june 1886 , and without recognizable variations thereafter until november 1888 .",
    "reports by other observers give essentially the same verdict ( e.g. , flammarion 1882 ; gore 1884 ; markwick 1892 ; campbell 1940 ) . as a result",
    ", there has been no encouragement to observe the star regularly and , from what follows , it must be concluded that during the years before the mid 1930s we have most likely failed to observe certain episodes of more distinct brightness variations",
    ".    an early attempt at investigating p cygni s short - term variations seems to have been made by von prittwitz ( 1900 ) who used a zllner photometer and , despite finding seemingly irregular variations with an amplitude of up to @xmath20 between 1898 and 1900 , concluded that the star showed `` no appreciable variations '' .",
    "later , however , after further observations between 1902 and 1907 , she concluded that `` p cygni shows a tendency to very gradually become somewhat brighter '' ( von prittwitz 1907 ) .",
    "von pritwitz s gradient over her 9-year observation period amounts to 2.1 magnitude per century , more than an order of magnitude larger than the above - quoted figure found by de groot and lamers over the much longer interval of almost three centuries .",
    "another notable exception to the generally indifferent attitude to p cygni s brightness is found in the work of the visual observers of the aavso .",
    "p cygni was included in their observing programme as early as 1917 and has remained there ever since with a respectable number of photoelectric measurements added since 1985 ( percy et al .",
    "the visual estimates made by the aavso observers suffer from some drawbacks , though .",
    "they were collected by a large number of individual visual obervers mostly with insufficiently known personal equations , making it difficult to construct a homogeneous light curve that accurately reflects the rather small - amplitude variations of the star .",
    "the early years of the aavso observations were also the early years of photoelectric photometry .",
    "however , in those early years there was no widely accepted standard photometric system .",
    "photoelectric detectors had very individual characteristics and the choice of filters seems to have been determined largely by whatever piece of coloured glass an observer could lay his hands on . this , together with the absence of serious encouragement for the photometry of p cygni , must have been largely responsible for the lack of photoelectric data that could in principle be tied in to a modern standard photometric system like , e.g. , the johnston ubv system .",
    "the situation improved considerably when the abastumani observers started systematic two - colour observations of p cygni in the mid 1930s ( kharadze 1936 ; nikonov 1936 , 1937 ) . though not all observations obtained since these earlier ones have been published ( kharadze et al .",
    "1952 ) and despite the fact that their pre-1951 observations were done with non - standard filters , these observers concluded that p cygni must be a w uma system with a period of @xmath60.5 d ( magalashvili and kharadze 1967a , b ) .",
    "they ascribed the absence of any earlier detection of this characteristic , and the belief that p cygni s light variations were wholly irregular , to the insufficient number of observations that had been made thus far .",
    "however , as pointed out by fernie ( 1968 ) , the wma interpretation is untenable because it requires a primary star with a mass of 50 @xmath2 and a secondary with an orbital velocity of 10,000 km s@xmath16 .",
    "alexander and wallerstein ( 1967 ) and luud ( 1969 ) have provided further photometric evidence and de groot ( 1969 ) gave spectroscopic reasons why p cygni can not be considered a simple multiple object .",
    "although the abastumani observers seem to have arrived at a wrong conclusion , one fact was established beyond reasonable doubt : p cygni is a photometric variable .",
    "here it is good to remember that dreyer , on the basis of a discussion of william herschel s observations of 1792 and 1795 , came to the conclusion that p cygni does show some , probably irregular , variation in brightness ( dreyer 1918 ) .",
    "zinner , too , found that pcygni `` apparently shows very rapid , substantial brightness variations '' ( zinner 1938 ) .",
    "the abastumani results did encourage later observers to dedicate some of their time to p cygni ( e.g. , groeneveld 1947 ) but there was never a long - term observing campaign until the 1980s when first percy and his co - workers ( percy and welch 1983 ; percy et al .",
    "1988 ) and then de groot ( de groot 1990 ) began observing p cygni on both a more regular basis and a longer time - scale . from these observations a number of characteristics of p cygni s light variations have become clear .",
    "a. : :    over the last 15 to 20 years ( and most likely over most of the time    since its two 17th century outbursts ) p cygni s variations have had a    maximum amplitude of about @xmath21 in @xmath22 .",
    "b. : :    most of the time the variations are slow , say    @xmath23 magn month@xmath16 in the v    band . c. : :    on a time - scale of months to a year there are larger , more rapid    variations , say @xmath24 magn    month@xmath16 in the @xmath22 band .",
    "d. : :    the overall light - curve shows a number of quasi - periodicities ranging    from 17 to @xmath25 d ( de groot et al . 1999 )",
    "nebulae around lbvs are of considerable interest since they provide clues to the mass - loss history of massive stars before they reach the lbv phase .",
    "p cygni s nebula is very faint at optical wavelengths and composed of a distribution of `` blobs '' within a spherically symmetric nebula with a diameter of 22@xmath26 .",
    "early detection of nebular emission lines [ sii ] 6716 , 6731  , [ nii ] 6584 in a long slit spectrum offset 9 arcsec east from p cygni was achieved by johnson et al .",
    "they found a ratio n / s of about 33@xmath15 by number from the [ nii ] and [ sii ] line fluxes .",
    "an anomalously strong nebular [ niii ] 6667   line was detected by johnson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and by barlow et al .",
    "lucy ( 1995 ) has explained the strength of the [ niii ] 7378 and 7412 emission from the fact that the [ niii ] emission in ejected globules is being fluorescently excited by the near - uv radiation of p cygni . according to barlow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) bow - shocks around these globules , generated by the radiatively driven wind from the star , are responsible for the difference between the [ nii ] 6584   and [ niii ] 7378 and 7412   expansion velocities of 140 and 110  @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "two faint outer arcs ( fig .",
    "4 ) with angular diameters 1@xmath28 and 1.5@xmath28 , respectively , have been discovered ( barlow et al . 1994 ) .",
    "meaburn et al . (",
    "1996 ) have measured a radial expansion velocity of 185  @xmath27 of the outer irregular shell located at 1.6 arcmin .",
    "the presence of two inner rings detected through the [ niii ] filter and having radii of @xmath6 11@xmath26 and 6@xmath26 has also been suggested ( barlow et al .",
    "if confirmed , a @xmath6 6@xmath26 ring could date back to the 1600 ad event . the shell located at 22@xmath26",

    "this filament was investigated further by meaburn et al .",
    "they concluded that this filament , which extends only to the east of p cygni , seems the relic of a highly asymmetric ejection some 20,000 years ago .",
    "however , the exact nature of this filament and how it was formed remains unclear , leaving several questions unanswered , not the least of which is the fact that this early outburst seems to have happened much longer ago than one would expect p cygni s lbv phase to have lasted .",
    "nevertheless , with shells from outbursts @xmath30 900 , @xmath30 2100 and , maybe @xmath30 20,000 years ago , a possible scenario for the episodic eruption history of p cygni is now taking shape .",
    "some lbvs exhibit an ir excess due to dust emission . at 60 @xmath31 m",
    "one would expect at least 7 - 8 jy from the p cygni nebula , assuming the same ratio of dust to ionized gas as observed in other galactic lbvs .",
    "however , waters and wesselius ( 1986 ) obtained 2.05 jy corresponding to an excess of only @xmath6 0.5 jy above the expected free - free emission from the stellar mantle at this wavelength .",
    "the observed infrared energy distribution of p cygni does not show any signature of dust emission and must be due to the free - free and bound - free continuum of the wind .",

    "the fact that doubly - ionized metals have larger width and smaller blue shift indicates that they are formed in the inner part of the wind .",

    "many feii lines have asymmetric absorption lines , deepest at @xmath41 with a sharp cut - off towards the violet and a gradual decrease towards the red at @xmath42 .",

    "p cygni has a 78 times lower terminal velocity and a 310 times higher mass - loss rate than other b1 supergiants ( de jager 1980 ; underhill 1982 ) .",
    "this apparently is the cause of the lower degree of ionization in the wind .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable feature in the spectrum of p cygni is the existence of discrete absorption components ( dacs ) of h , he , c , n , fe and many other elements .",
    "dacs have a fwhm about 1015 @xmath27 and , therefore , only high - resolution observations can reveal them . the first extensive analysis of multiple absorption components was made by de groot ( 1969 ) who observed three variable componenets in the hydrogen lines at @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and two in the helium lines .",

    "these slow profile changes are most probably related to the variations detected by stahl et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and can be caused by non - radial pulsations .",
    "there have been a number of detections ( cassatella et al .",

    "( table 1 ) .",
    "however , detailed studies have been performed only of those detected in fe .",
    "variable dacs in feii and feiii have been studied in 33 high - resolution _ iue _ spectra by lamers et al .",

    "with hindsight , it is now clear that this failure was due to their use of blended iron lines in their analysis .",
    "when one uses all available iron lines , two components are clearly seen in the feiii lines ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "more recently , israelian et al . (",
    "1996 ) have analysed 49 high - resolution _ iue _ spectra obtained in the period 19851991 and found a repetition time between two successive shells of 200@xmath111 days .",

    "p cygni is the only star in which dacs have been followed for more than 30 years . in spite of all observational studies of dacs ,",
    "the mechanism of their formation is still unknown .",
    "dacs can be produced by spherically symmetric shells , or asymmetric blobs , puffs , etc . in this paper",
    "we will use the term _ shell _ , keeping in mind that these can be blobs , etc .",
    "shells are denser and have smaller accelerations than the mean wind material .",
    "at least three mechanisms have appeared in the literature aimed at explaining the shell - ejection phenomenon in p cygni .",
    "lamers et al . ( 1985 ) used the isw model of kwok et al .",
    "( 1978 ) assuming that shells gain their momentum from the fast wind accelerated between the shell and the star .",
    "this mechanism neglects radiation pressure acting on the shells and suggests that shells will increase their mass in time ( because of the interaction with the fast - moving wind material ) and will eventually reach a constant velocity .",
    "another , simplified model was proposed by kahn ( 1989 ) who estimated that lyman alpha radiation is able to account for the acceleration of shells observed in the optical region .",
    "kahn ( 1989 ) and lamers et al . (",
    "1985 ) did not make any suggestions on the shell  formation mechanism .",
    "finally , pauldrach and puls ( 1990 ) suggested a so called _ bi - stability _ mechanism in which shells represent a high mass  loss and small @xmath53 state of the wind which is optically thick in the lyman continuum .",
    "according to their models , the high mass  loss state of the wind is caused by the radiation pressure on singly - ionized metals .",
    "the interaction between fast and slow material was neglected in the bi - stable models of pauldrach and puls ( 1990 ) . they have demonstrated that p cygni s wind is very unstable with respect to small changes in the luminosity ( @xmath54 ) or radius ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this finding has led them to propose a cyclic mechanism for the shell - ejection phenomenon . according to this mechanism",
    ", the photospheric temperature of the star is controlled by a moving shell due to the wind - blanketing effect .",
    "the photospheric temperature increases during a high mass  loss phase ( e.g. by backscattering from a shell ) until the hydrogen becomes ionized .",
    "this leads to a decrease of the line force since the lyman continuum is optically thin and there are not many lines from singly - ionized metals to drive the wind .",
    "thus , the mass - loss rate switches back towards its lower value and the wind blanketing decreases together with the photospheric temperature . now again , since the photospheric temperature is low , the hydrogen will recombine and the wind blanketing will start to increase leading to the formation of a new shell . this bi - stability mechanism suggested by pauldrach and puls ( 1990 ) is able to explain some of the observed characteristics of the shell  ejection phenomenon . in particular , according to the bi - stability model , the shell ejection must be accompanied by photometric changes of the star due to the variations of the surface temperature .",
    "such a correlation has been suggested by israelian et al .",

    "it is not yet clear whether these blobs can be identified with the dacs observed in uv and optical lines .",
    "it is interesting to mention in this respect , that vakili et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using the grand interfromtre  2 tlescopes ( gi2 t ) found a bright localized blob of moving gas at 4 photospheric radii to the south of p cygni .",
    "similar dacs have been widely observed in the uv spectra of many other hot , massive stars ( howarth and prinja 1989 ) .",
    "however , in contrast with other ob - type supergiants , dacs in p cygni s spectrum do not appear in the resonance lines of siiv and civ but in the subordinate lines of metals .",
    "also , dacs in p cygni can be followed for weeks or months while those detected in normal ob supergiants have time - scales of the order of hours to days .",
    "finally , it seems that in all instances the dacs observed in p cygni were much broader than those observed in other early - type supergiants .",
    "the intrinsic instability of the winds provide the basis for numerical simulations of this behaviour ( owocki 1998 ) .",
    "the involvement of non - radial pulsations ( nrps ) in this phenomenon may contribute an injection of seeds of instability into the wind .",
    "several continuous _",
    "monitoring campaigns of a limited number of objects concluded that the variability of the wind is probably coupled to the rotational time - scales . in these cases a cyclically repeating pattern in the development of dacs was observed .",
    "however , their phase coherence within the few cycles was relatively uncertain .",
    "the rotation periods normally exceed the repetition time - scales of dacs by a small factor and the uncertainties in both quantities do not allow one to conclude whether their ratio is a whole number or not .",
    "a whole number could have been due to co - rotating surface magnetic structures while a non - integer ratio would indicate the presence of nrps .",
    "the problem is still open and more multiwavelength observing compaigns are required to resolve it . returning to p cygni",

    "the high n@xmath66/n@xmath67 abundance ratio confirms that p cygni has evolved away from the zams .",
    "there are indications ( johnson et al . 1992 )",
    "that p cygni s nebula is composed of material in which most of the original carbon has been converted into nitrogen by the cn cycle .",
    "since it is known that the cn cycle achieves equilibrium before the cno cycle converts all oxygen into nitrogen , the fact that we observe pseudo - photospheric absorption lines of oxygen indicating a solar abundance of this element ( israelian 1995 ) suggests that the upper atmosphere has not yet been contaminated by the products of the cno cycle .",
    "p cygni is in a relatively quiescent phase of its post - main - sequence lbv life , exhibiting small - scale spectrophotometric variations but not undergoing the moderate photometric outbursts observed in s dor , ag car and other lbvs .",
    "the 1600 ad outburst confirms that p cygni must have crossed the humphreys - davidson instability limit at least once .",
    "however , we do not know whether it will suffer further outbursts in the future or how soon , if ever , it will evolve towards a wolf - rayet - like phase . using the pulsational analysis of kiriakidis et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , langer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) proposed the following evolutionary sequence for very massive stars : o star @xmath4 of @xmath4 h - rich wn star @xmath4 lbv @xmath4 h - poor wn star @xmath4 h - free wn star @xmath4 wc @xmath4 sn .",
    "they have identified p cygni with the hydrogen shell - burning phase and derived a current mass of 23@xmath15@xmath2 .",
    "this value of the mass , although in conflict with the 50@xmath2   suggested by el eid and hartmann ( 1993 ) , does fit stellar parameters of the star obtained from a detailed spectroscopic analysis by najarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the giant and moderate variations of lbvs has been intuitively linked to a pulsation instability .",
    "the understading of this mechanism is of great importance and will help to understand the intermediate phases in the evolutionary chain o - star @xmath4 lbv @xmath4 wr - star .",
    "maeder ( 1989 ) proposed density inversions that would cause strong instabilities in the atmospheres of lbvs .",
    "inverted density gradients may lead to pulsation solutions ( so called strange modes ) that can grow rapidly in amplitude .",
    "these pulsations lie in regions where the supra - eddington luminosity causes an opacity peak .",
    "the rapid growth of the density inversion results in an outburst .",
    "the star moves again to the blue ( away from the hd limit ) when the luminosity decreases to below the eddington limit in the now exposed deeper layers and the opacity becomes so low that it can no longer drive the catastrophic mass loss .",
    "a high helium abundance tends to stabilize the outburst by decreasing the pulsation amplitude .",
    "stothers and chin ( 1993 , 1995 ) have investigated a dynamical instability of massive stars in the linear adiabatic approximation and found a relation between its occurrence and values below 4/3 of the mean adiabatic exponent @xmath70 averaged over a conveniently chosen part of the stellar envelope .",
    "their results have not been confirmed by glatzel and kirakidis ( 1998 ) who also questioned the validity of the adiabatic approximation for a stability analysis of massive stars .",
    "however , recently stothers ( 1999a ) has performed a numerical stability analysis based on linear and nonlinear hydrodynamical models of nonadiabatic , spherically symmetric stellar envelopes , and confirmed results of stothers and chin ( 1993 , 1995 ) that the purely adiabatic criterion @xmath71 does in fact determine dynamical stability .",
    "it has been also shown ( stothers 1999b ) that rotation is not affecting directly the possible course of stellar evolution .",
    "for lbvs , evolving in a late stage of helium - core burning , the luminosity - to - mass ratio would probably be increased by rotation .",
    "the dependence of nonadiabatic instabilities on stellar parameters is linked with the properties of the corresponding opacity maxima ( fe , he or he / h opacity bumps ) and their positions within the star .",
    "numerical simulations ( cox et al .",
    "1997 ; guzik et al .",
    "1997 ) of the evolution of strange modes show that the outburst occurs when relatively deep atmospheric layers exceed the eddington luminosity causing a sudden increase of the photospheric radial velocity ( up to 200  @xmath27 ) .",
    "the rapid opacity rise during a pulsation cycle will lead to supra - eddington luminosities .",
    "the question is whether in a real star the convection will turn rapidly enough to transport the radiation . to be more realistic",
    ", these numerical simulations should consider at least 1 ) time - dependent convection , 2 ) a large number of grid points , and 3 ) to follow the material as it leaves the stellar surface .",
    "the last point is added in order to bring the theory closer to the observations .",
    "it is also not clear whether these models are predicting ( or aiming to predict ) moderate or giant eruptions . in general",
    ", the results of such simulations must be interpreted with caution .",
    "even after a study of 400 years , at times particularly intensive during this century , p cygni continues to baffle us .",
    "surely enough , progress has been made , many observations using different techniques and covering almost all wavelength regions have been made , various aspects of the star s behaviour have come to be known , and some of the latter have begun to be understood . despite all this , the number of unanswered questions will be capable of occupying the investigative efforts of a whole generation of researchers . without pretending to be complete , here",
    "we offer a list , in no particular order , of the more important questions deserving our attention in our 21st and p cygni s 5th century .",
    ": :    p cygni has shown us that to disentangle the combined effects of a    variety of physical processes , the value of long series of    observations can not be overestimated .",
    "this approach needs to be    continued and also applied more frequently to other objects . : :    the mechanism causing giant outbursts in lbvs is not yet understood .",
    "one senses that the mass of the star is the most important parameter ,    but how differences in mass are manifested in different outbursts and    in the overall history of the star , is still a matter of contention    that requires both more observations and more calculations . in this    respect",
    ", the apparent low frequency of giant outbursts seems to    indicate that we will need some patience before getting to the bottom    of this question .",
    ": :    while the short - term variations , both in brightness and in    spectral - line profiles , are there to be observed all the time , their    mechanism is still surrounded by a nebulosity of unanswered questions .",
    "the influences of rotation , pulsations , and magnetic fields , just to    name a few , are not yet sufficiently understood .",
    ": :    we chose the title `` p cygni : an extraordinary lbv '' for this review .",
    "is the adjective ` extraordinary ' due to the fact that p cygni , despite    being the first of something , is not a good example of a lbv ? whatever    the answer to this question , does p cygni teach us valuable lessons    about lbvs in general , or are all such stars peculiar in one way or    other and need an individual approach ? do small differences in    physical parameters produce vastly different phenomena in the upper    regions of the hr diagram ?    it is the authors s hope that this review may be of some help to keep the interest in p cygni alive so that further progress towards a more complete understanding of this ` extraordinary lbv ' can be made .",
