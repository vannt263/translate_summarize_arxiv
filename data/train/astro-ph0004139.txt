    "the genesis of powerful radio jets from active galactic nuclei is one of the long standing problems in astrophysics ( bridle & perley 1984 ) .",
    "although global morphological properties give us very important information , very inner regions in the radio jets also provide hints to understanding the genesis of radio jets . in order to investigate radio galaxies at the sub - milli arcsecond angular resolution ,",
    "we have performed new high - resolution vlbi observations of ngc 6251 using halca ( hirabayashi et al .",
    "we use a distance to ngc 6251 , 94.4 mpc ( for a hubble constant @xmath2 = 75 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) . note",
    "that 1 mas ( milli arcsecond ) corresponds to 0.48 pc at this distance .",
    "ngc 6251 was observed at 5 ghz using vsop on 30 april 1998 and at 15 ghz using vlba on 2 june 1998 .",
    "details of the observations are summarized in table 1 . in order to perform",
    "beam - size - matched comparison between 5 ghz and 15 ghz , we restored the two images with a same spatial resolution of 0.50 @xmath4 0.50 mas .    .observations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath0dr : dynamic range ; @xmath1eb : effelsberg 100-m telescope",
    "our final maps at 5 ghz and 15 ghz are shown in figure 1a and 1b , respectively .",
    "although the secondary peak is seen at both frequencies , its angular distance from the 15 ghz brightest peak is larger by 0.3 mas ( 0.14 pc ) than that at 5 ghz .",
    "this difference may be attributed to the different opacity toward the central engine at 5 ghz and 15 ghz .    here",
    "we apply two new methods for the registration using correlation functions between intensity profiles and between wiggling patterns of the radio jet at the two frequencies .",
    "the correlation function of intensity profiles exhibits the maximum correlation coefficient @xmath5 at an offset of 0.30 @xmath6 0.11 mas , indicating that the peak at 5 ghz is shifted to the jet direction from that at 15 ghz .",
    "analysis of wiggling patterns gives an offset of 0.60 @xmath6 0.36 mas with a correlation coefficient of @xmath70.66 .",
    "since these two offsets were obtained using the two independent methods , we adopt a weighted average of the two offsets .",
    "thus the best offset of 0.42 @xmath6 0.14 mas is obtained . using this offset",
    ", we register the two images and obtain a spectral index image of the radio jet as shown in figure 1c .",
    "it can be seen optically thin component in the opposite side of the jet .",
    "we conclude that this is the real counter jet .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the core is surrounded by a plasma sphere with a radius of @xmath8 and the radio emission from the inner part of the jets ( i.e. , both the jet and the counter jet ) suffer from the free - free absorption .",
    "the approaching jet escapes from the plasma sphere at a projected distance of @xmath9 and thus the spectral index becomes to be intrinsic here .",
    "the counter jet suffers the effect of free - free absorption until @xmath10 .",
    "it is also noted that the path length is longest at @xmath11 . as shown in figure 2a , we define the following projected distances ; @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ". then we are able to estimate @xmath14 .",
    "we adopt the 15 ghz brightest peak as the core , because the optical depth at 15 ghz is enough to be small in the case of free - free absorption . in figure 2b , we show the observed spectral index variation along the radio jet .",
    "we estimate @xmath15 0.24 mas , @xmath16 0.41 mas , and @xmath17 0.80 mas .",
    "then we obtain @xmath18 .    adopting the so - called doppler beaming model , the jet to the counter jet intensity ratio @xmath19",
    "can be written as a function of projected distance @xmath20 , @xmath21^{2 -     \\alpha(x)}$ ] , where ( @xmath20 ) = @xmath22 . in figure 3a , we measured @xmath19 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath19 is estimated to be systematically larger at 5 ghz than those at 15 ghz .",
    "this is probably due to stronger absorption at 5 ghz than at 15 ghz .",
    "it is shown that @xmath19 at 15 ghz increases from 1.7 at 0.85 mas ( 0.4 pc ) to 10 at 1.25 mas ( 0.6 pc ) with projected distance from the core .",
    "if this increase is just caused by the doppler beaming , it is suggested that   increase with distance , because it can not be seen that   varies significantly .",
    "figure 3b shows that the jet is accelerated from   @xmath23 at 0.4 pc to   @xmath24 at 0.6 pc .",
    "this provides the first direct evidence for the acceleration at the sub - pc - scale radio jet .",
