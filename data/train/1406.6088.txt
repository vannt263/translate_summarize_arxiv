    "<S> the emergence of flocking in this model is akin to a liquid - gas transition between an ordered liquid and a disordered gas . unlike the traveling bands of the vm , inhomogeneous profiles in the aim are fully phase - separated , with a single macroscopic liquid domain traveling in the gas ( fig  [ fig : domain_bands ] ) . more generally , the symmetry difference between the two models questions the relevance of this framework for the vm .    in this letter </S>",

    "<S> closing a long - standing debate , we indeed show that the dense ordered bands of the vm are arranged periodically in space , leading to an effectively `` smectic '' phase . </S>",
    "<S> we define an appropriate `` liquid fraction '' which allows us to recover the usual linear behavior across the coexistence region . </S>",

    "<S> the phase diagram of a liquid - gas phase transition in the canonical ensemble is its unusual shape , which stems from the different symmetries of the two phases . </S>",

    "<S> while the phase diagrams of vm and aim have similar shapes , their coexistence regions are fundamentally different . starting from random initial conditions , the dynamics of the vm rapidly leads to randomly spaced ordered bands propagating along a direction @xmath41 and spanning the system along @xmath42 , as reported before  @xcite . on much longer time - scales , unreached in these studies , the relaxation of compression modes actually leads to _ regularly _ spaced bands ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> only the band number @xmath45 increases , proportionally to @xmath46 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase_diagram]-b&d ) . for finite systems , </S>",
    "<S> the quantization of the liquid fraction has some interesting consequences . </S>",
    "<S> an excess mass @xmath47 which is not a multiple of the excess mass @xmath48 of a single band does not allow the system to relax to its asymptotic band - shape . to accomodate this excess mass </S>",
    "<S> the bands are slightly deformed , but @xmath49 and @xmath44 barely change as @xmath43 is varied ( not shown ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this smectic arrangement of finite - width bands markedly differs from the more conventional liquid - gas phase - separation seen in the aim , where increasing the density simply widens the single liquid domain . </S>",
    "<S> one may thus wonder whether all features of the liquid - gas scenario survive . </S>",
    "<S> the global polarisation @xmath50 , used in previous studies of the vm to characterize the onset of ordering  @xcite , does not show a linear increase of the liquid fraction with density ( fig  [ fig : hysteresis]-a ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is yet another signature of the first - order nature of the transition and confirms the analogy with the canonical liquid - gas transition ; the apparent singularity of @xmath59 close to @xmath44 is a simple consequence of its normalisation , not of criticality ( as often assumed in the literature ) .     for l=2048 ( squares ) and l=1024 ( lines ) . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , a band can only be observed if the excess density @xmath57 is of the order of @xmath64 . as the system size increases , bands are hence seen closer and closer to @xmath44 which thus coincide with the binodal @xmath65 , as in a standard liquid - gas transition . </S>",

    "<S> we found both smectic micro - phases and phase - separated profiles . </S>",
    "<S> which solution is observed depends only on the initial condition and not on the symmetry of the ordering field . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sol_pde ] shows a periodic solution in the spde and a single traveling domain in the vpde obtained for the same parameter values , a striking evidence that the ( deterministic ) hydrodynamic equations alone _ can not _ explain the selection of different patterns observed in microscopic models . </S>",
    "<S> this result was found robust to modifications of eqs .  - .    </S>",
    "<S> we call ssde and vsde the stochastic versions of eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> integrating first ssde and vsde in the homogeneous liquid phase , we recover the same density fluctuations as in the corresponding microscopic models ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sde ] left ) : normal fluctuations in ssde , giant ones in vsde ( with the same scaling as in microscopic models ) . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we recover the correct type of inhomogeneous profiles in each case , irrespective of the initial conditions . for instance , starting from a large liquid domain as initial condition in both sets of equations with the same parameters , we find that ssde keeps this configuration while it breaks down in vsde , eventually leading to a periodic array of bands ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sde ] right ) . in the converse experiment , </S>",
    "<S> starting from a configuration with many bands , we observe initially merging events in both cases but this process stops in vsde , leading to an asymptotic periodic state with a finite number of bands , while coarsening proceeds for ssde .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that fluctuations play an essential role in selecting the phase - separated patterns . </S>",
    "<S> note that similar experiments performed in microscopic models yield similar results . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the vm at relatively high noise large liquid domains are metastable for a long enough time to be observed before fluctuations break them and lead the system to the smectic micro - phase state ( see movie in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> giant density fluctuations break large liquid domains and arrest band - coarsening while normal fluctuations do not . </S>",
    "<S> two different scenarios emerge : in the active ising class , magnetization is a scalar quantity , density fluctuations are normal and the system undergoes bulk phase separation . in the active xy or vicsek class , magnetization is vectorial , density fluctuations in the liquid are anomalously large and drive the system to the micro - phase separated state .    to summarize , we have shown that the flocking transition in the vicsek model amounts to a micro - phase liquid - gas transition in the canonical ensemble exhibiting metastability , hysteresis and coexistence between a disordered gas and a smectic arrangement of liquid bands . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with the bulk phase separation exhibited by the active ising model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that while ( deterministic ) hydrodynamic equations do _ not _ explain this difference , their stochastic counterparts do : the different nature of the order parameter produces different types of number fluctuations , which are essential in selecting the phase - separated patterns . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected role of fluctuations in the selection of flock shapes calls for a greater care when trying to account for active systems based on purely deterministic continuum equations .    </S>",
    "<S> interesting questions remain open . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the mechanism by which the bands interact in the vm to reach a periodic spacing and the chaotic behavior of closely packed bands are still to be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> further , we so far have no analytical approach and limited numerical results to ascertain the stability of the smectic pattern in the direction along the bands . </S>",
    "<S> it is not inconceivable that , like recently found in active nematics  @xcite , the coexistence phase is asymptotically disordered . </S>",
    "<S> last , in the large density region , the finite sizes of real flocking agents are not negligible and steric effects such as motility - induced phase separation  @xcite could enrich the simple liquid - gas scenario  @xcite .    </S>",
