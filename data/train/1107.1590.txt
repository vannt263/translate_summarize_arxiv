    "there is current interest in developing quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) for quantum information processing.@xcite great progress in this direction has been made using vertical qdms fabricated with epitaxial growth techniques .",
    "these structures are formed by pairs of vertically stacked qds with a thin barrier in between .",
    "because the constituent qds are generally asymmetric , electric fields applied along the coupling direction are used to control the charge and the tunnel coupling strength.@xcite    in the last years , developement of qdms formed by laterally coupled qd pairs is also being pursued.@xcite in these structures , the qd pair is formed inside the same epitaxial layers .",
    "this architecture is expected to offer some advantages as compared to vertical qdms.@xcite in particular , independent control of qd charging and tunneling strength should be possible through the application of vertical and lateral electric fields , respectively . also , simultaneous coupling of multiple qdms , which is a requirement for the scaling of qubit operations , should be feasible through the implementation of individual electric gates for each qdm . on the other hand , lateral qdms present their own obstacles .",
    "for example , the distance between the centers of the qds is much larger than in vertical structures , which implies weaker tunneling . indeed , despite recent advances in the electrical engineering of lateral qdms , which include the demonstration of coulomb blockade charging@xcite and tuning of optical resonances@xcite , the application of lateral electric fields producing clear spectroscopic signatures of molecular coupling remains a challenge .",
    "understanding the differences between the physics of lateral qdms and the better known case of vertical qdms will contribute to determine the conditions for optimal device performance , be it vertical , lateral or hybrid.@xcite many of the differences arise from the distinct synthetic routes , which lead to characteristic structural and compositional profiles.@xcite thus , in lateral qdms it has been shown that the weaker quantum confinement of the qds along the coupling direction leads to an enhanced role of the excited orbitals within the qds.@xcite also , the nonradiative relaxation dynamics of lateral ingaas qdms has been shown to follow a singular path.@xcite    in this paper , we study the optical resonances of neutral , negatively - charged and positively - charged excitons in lateral ingaas qdms as a function of the interdot distance .",
    "the dots have slightly different energies , as is often the case with current growth techniques.@xcite we find that tunnel - coupling of trions is stronger than that of neutral excitons .",
    "this leads to signatures in the photoluminescence spectrum at zero electric field which can be used to distinguish uncoupled qd pairs from coupled qdms .",
    "the convenience of using trions instead of neutral excitons for quantum information protocols is discussed .",
    "our hamiltonian for excitons and trions can be written in the second quantization as :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the electron ( hole ) energy in the single - particle state @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the electron ( hole ) creation / annihilation operator , i.e. , ( @xmath7 ) ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron - electron , hole - hole and electron - hole coulomb matrix elements respectively .",
    "electron - hole exchange term is safely neglected because in the absence of magnetic fields and spin mixing , it has no effect on the observed emission spectrum .    to calculate the single - particle states , we use a two - dimensional effective mass hamiltonian for electrons and heavy holes :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the index denoting electrons or holes , @xmath15 is the effective mass , @xmath16 the momentum operator , and @xmath17 the quantum confinement potential . for a pair of qds whose",

    "a contour plot of this potential profile for a slightly asymmetric qdm is shown in figure [ fig : vxy ] .",
    "similar models were previously adopted to study laterally coupled qds  @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hsp ] ) is integrated numerically using a finite differences scheme .",
    "the resulting electron and hole states are plugged into hamiltonian ( [ hfull ] ) , together with the coulomb matrix elements , which we calculate using statistical methods .",
    "the hamiltonian is then solved using a configuration interaction routine.@xcite in this way , we obtain an accurate description of the ground and excited states of the qdm system .",
    "to simulate their emission spectrum , we use the dipole approximation and fermi s golden rule.@xcite the recombination probability from an initial few - body state @xmath3 to a final state @xmath22 with one less electron - hole pair , at an emission frequency @xmath23 is then given by :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the polarization operator@xcite",

    "@xmath30 is the thermal population distribution function for the initial state at temperature @xmath31 .",
    "we shall consider two possible dynamics for the emission process : ( i ) emission takes place from all the excited states , which are populated through non - resonant excitation , prior to their thermal relaxation .",
    "we simulate this adopting the same occupation probability for all the initial states , @xmath32 ; ( ii ) recombination once the thermal equilibrium is reached . in this case",
    "we assume a boltzmann distribution @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the degeneracy factor of the state @xmath3 ( ground state ) , @xmath36 the energy difference between @xmath3 and the ground state , @xmath37 the boltzmann constant and @xmath38 the normalization constant .    in our calculations we consider laterally coupled ingaas / gaas qds .",
    "we shall use parameters which , for long interdot distances , fit the emission spectrum observed in single qds fabricated upon gaas nanohole templates.@xcite effective masses are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as corresponding to in@xmath41ga@xmath42as , and the dielectric constant @xmath43.@xcite the electron confinement frequencies are @xmath44 mev and @xmath45 mev , so that the right qd is slightly bigger than the left qd .",

    "this means that holes are more confined than electrons , and their tunneling will be negligible .",
    "similar @xmath49 ratios have been estimated in recent experiments with ingaas qds.@xcite the bandwidth of the lorentzian function in our spectral simulations is 0.05 mev . for the many - body calculation , we project hamiltonian ( [ hfull ] ) onto all the single - particle configurations which can be obtained by combining the 24 lowest - energy electron and hole spin - orbitals .",
    "the origin of electron ( hole ) single - particle energies is taken at the edge of the conduction ( valence ) band , disregarding the @xmath50-confinement energy , which is constant for all the states .",
    "figure [ fig : tot ] shows the emission spectrum of the qdm as a function of the interdot distance @xmath18 , from @xmath51 nm ( isolated qds ) to @xmath52 nm ( strongly coupled qds ) .",
    "solid red and dashed green lines are used for negative trions ( @xmath53 ) and neutral excitons ( @xmath54 ) , respectively .",
    "here we assume an out - of - equilibrium system .",
    "in this way , we simulate optically active transitions from ground and excited states of both qds , as normally observed in the photoluminescence spectra of vertical  @xcite and lateral  @xcite qdms . the most remarkable result of fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] is that the @xmath53 and @xmath54 resonances follow very different evolutions as the qds are brought closer together . to understand the different behavior , we need to analyze each excitonic complex in detail .        in the limit of the uncoupled qdm ,",
    "@xmath51 nm , @xmath54 shows two resonances of similar intensity split by @xmath55 mev .",
    "as @xmath18 is reduced , the two resonances are slowly redshifted , but the energy splitting remains approximately constant .",
    "this behavior can be understood from the exciton states , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : x0 ] .",
    "the emission resonances correspond to the two lowest @xmath54 states . at @xmath51 nm ,",
    "these are the direct excitons , with the electron - hole pair in the big ( low - energy resonance ) and small ( high - energy resonance ) qd , see right - side insets in the figure .",
    "indirect excitons ( electron and hole in opposite qds ) are much higher in energy and optically dark because the electron - hole overlap is negligible .",
    "as the interdot distance decreases , tunnel coupling allows electrons and holes to start hybridizing and form incipient molecular orbitals , even if the qds are not exactly resonant .",
    "the lowest @xmath54 state corresponds to bonding ( nodeless ) electron and hole orbitals , so it is redshifted .",
    "the first excited state corresponds to bonding electron but antibonding hole orbital ( note the presence of a node in the green line of the upper - left inset ) .",
    "yet , this makes little difference because hole tunneling is negligible . as a result",
    ", the two states are redshifted by a similar amount .    the @xmath54 emission spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] differs from previous calculations for asymmetric lateral qdms , where the two lowest @xmath54 states were at some point blueshifted by coulomb coupling.@xcite this is due to the different confining potentials in the models . in ref .",
    ", the interdot barrier was a step - like potential .",
    "instead , we use a parabolic potential such that , with decreasing @xmath18 , not only the qds are closer but also the barrier is lower .",
    "for this reason , tunnel coupling effects rapidly overcome coulomb coupling in our system .",
    "real qdms are lens - shaped qds with some degree of lateral contact.@xcite as the dots are brought closer , the height in the contact region increases .",
    "we then believe our model is more appropriate .",
    "nm ( right ) and @xmath52 nm ( left).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    next we investigate the @xmath53 spectrum . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] , at @xmath51 nm there are four resonances associated with @xmath53 states .",
    "two resonances (1 ) and ( 2) are a few mev below those of @xmath54 , while two are degenerate with the @xmath54 ones .",
    "as @xmath18 is reduced , several features show up which differ from the simple behavior of neutral excitons : ( i ) the number of resonances increases ( up to 10 ) ; ( ii ) the two low - energy resonances invert their ordering ; ( iii ) the degeneracy between the high - energy @xmath53 and the @xmath54 resonances is lifted .",
    "significantly , most of this occurs even before the neutral exciton starts feeling tunnel coupling ( see e.g. @xmath56 nm ) .    to understand the @xmath53 emission spectrum , we study the energy levels of the initial ( @xmath53 ) and final ( @xmath57 ) states , which are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : x- ] . the electron , fig .",
    "[ fig : x-](b ) , displays a simple dissociation spectrum typical of diatomic heteronuclear molecules . at @xmath51",
    "nm the electron is in one of the two qds ( see right insets ) . with decreasing @xmath18 , it forms bonding and antibonding ( noded ) molecular orbitals ( see left insets ) . as for the trion , fig .",
    "[ fig : x-](a ) , the two lowest - energy states correspond to the so - called direct trion states . their behavior is the same as that of @xmath54 .",
    "namely , at @xmath51 nm all the carriers are localized inside one of the qds , and they are redshifted with decreasing @xmath18 owing to electron hybridization ( see insets ) . as indicated by the vertical arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : x- ] , resonance 1 ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] originates in the transition from the direct @xmath53 state in the right ( left ) qd to the electron state in the same qd .",
    "the energy splitting between the two initial states is larger than that between the final states . as a result , transition ( 1 ) is lower in energy .",
    "however , as @xmath18 decreases the situation reverses .",
    "transition ( 1 ) involves bonding initial and final states , whose energetic stabilizations due to tunnel - coupling compensate each other . as a result , the energy of the transition is little sensitive to the coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tot ] ) .",
    "in contrast , transition ( 2 ) involves a bonding initial state but an antibonding final state , so its energy rapidly decreases .",
    "this is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] and leads to a reversal of resonances ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) at @xmath58 nm . what is more , because of the qdm asymmetry , transitions between bonding and antibonding states are not symmetry - forbidden .",
    "then , when electron hybridization takes place new transitions start developing , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "resonances ( 3),(4),(5 ) and ( 6 ) in the @xmath53 spectrum originate in a set of excited trion states with energy @xmath59 ev at @xmath51 nm .",
    "these are the so - called indirect trions , where one electron sits in a qd and the remaining electron - hole pair sits in the opposite qd ( see insets in fig .  [",
    "fig : x- ] ) . when the electron - hole pair recombines , the electron in the opposite qd remains . at @xmath51 nm ,",
    "the coulomb interaction between the two qds is so weak that the indirect trion resonances have the same energy as those of @xmath54 . with decreasing @xmath18 , however ,",
    "the behavior of indirect trions becomes noticeably different from that of neutral excitons .",
    "the indirect trion states split into two groups .",
    "one group is formed by states where the two electrons form a singlet spin configuration .",
    "these states increase in energy and eventually anticross with higher states .",
    "this destabilization is mainly caused by the gradual enhancement of the antibonding character . in contrast",
    ", the group of states with electrons forming a triplet remains almost insensitive to tunnel - coupling due to the spin - blockade .",
    "this effect is analogous to that observed in vertical qdms under electric fields , where the pauli exclusion principle prevents triplet states from tunneling.@xcite the characteristic evolution of indirect trions vs.  @xmath18 is responsible for the lifting of the degeneracy with @xmath54 resonances observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] .",
    "last , as in the case of direct trions , the qdm asymmetry enables transitions from indirect trions to either bonding or antibonding electron states , which gives rise to new resonances when electrons hybridize , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",

    "vertical arrows indicate the transitions observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the different evolution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 resonances in the emission spectrum of qdms can be used to elucidate the presence of molecular coupling .",
    "the appearance of additional trion resonances should be a clear signature , but they may be too weak for typical interdot distances ( @xmath60 nm in ref .  ) .",
    "a more evident signature should be the splitting between @xmath54 and indirect @xmath53 resonances , which involves intense optical resonances and is visible for long interdot distances ( @xmath61 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] ) .",
    "finally , the reversal of resonances ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) may also be noticed in experiments . for @xmath62 nm ,",
    "this implies that trion emission from the bigger qd occurs at higher energy than that from the smaller qd , contrary to the ordering of @xmath54 resonances . as a matter of fact",
    ", this anomalous spectral ordering has been recently found in photoluminescence measurements of lateral qdms.@xcite      we next study the emission spectrum of the positive trion ( @xmath63 ) . in this case , assuming equal population for all the initial states would lead to a complex spectrum with many resonances involving highly - excited initial and final states . since we are interested in the main transitions only , the emission spectrum plotted in fig .",
    "[ plx+ ] has been computed assuming thermal equilibrium at @xmath64 k. at this temperature , the @xmath63 states with significant population are essentially the same as previously studied for @xmath53 .",
    "the only remaining signature of transitions between excited states is the low - energy resonance labeled with an asterisk in fig .",
    "[ plx+ ] , which will not be studied here .        comparing figs .",
    "[ plx+ ] and  [ fig : tot ] one can see that the @xmath63 emission pattern differs considerably from the @xmath53 one . to analyze the emission spectrum , in fig .",
    "[ x+ ] we represent the initial ( @xmath63 ) and final ( @xmath65 ) states as a function of the interdot distance .",
    "the first important difference with respect to @xmath53 can be seen in the final state , fig .",
    "[ x+](b ) .",
    "unlike for electrons , the two lowest hole states remain almost unaltered throughout the entire range of @xmath18 , due to the negligible tunneling .",
    "this means that the evolution of the @xmath63 emission spectrum can be entirely interpreted from the initial @xmath63 states .",
    "the second important difference is in the @xmath63 states , plotted in fig .",
    "[ x+](a ) .",
    "there we find two direct and two indirect states , as in the @xmath53 case , but now their energy ordering is reversed . at @xmath51 nm ,",
    "the two lowest states are indirect trions , with one hole in each qd and the electron in either the left or right qd ( see insets ) .",
    "we note that indirect @xmath63 ground states have also been obtained in 3d atomistic calculations  @xcite , and are due the larger magnitude of the hole - hole coulomb repulsion as compared to the electron - hole attraction , i.e.   @xmath66 .",
    "the situation is the opposite to that of @xmath53 , where @xmath67 , which favors direct trion configurations .",
    "the resonances labeled as ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) in fig .  [ plx+ ] originate in the recombination of the direct trions . as the interdot distance",
    "is reduced they redshift slowly .",
    "the evolution of the indirect trion resonances , ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , is however drastic .",
    "the two resonances become rapidly split with decreasing @xmath18 , reflecting the strong splitting of indirect trions in fig .",
    "[ x+](a ) .",
    "such a large splitting follows from the strong tunneling of indirect @xmath63 . unlike for @xmath54 , the electron in indirect @xmath63 can tunnel back and forth without losing the strong on - site coulomb attraction @xmath68",
    "this clearly favors molecular coupling.@xcite furthermore , the electron delocalization over the entire qdm enables effective recombination with both holes , leading to the appearance of additional resonances , ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , at relatively long interdot distance ( see e.g. , @xmath69 nm ) .",

    "vertical arrows indicate the transitions observed in  [ plx+].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in this section , we re - examine the emission spectra assuming thermal equilibrium at low temperature .",
    "this greatly simplifies the spectrum , as only populated initial states contribute to the spectrum .",
    "we consider @xmath70 k , which is enough for both qds to have finite occupation .",
    "[ fig : t25 ] shows the emission spectrum for @xmath53 ( solid red lines ) , @xmath54 ( dashed green lines ) and @xmath63 ( dotted blue lines ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath53 ( @xmath63 ) resonances is essentially that of the direct ( indirect ) species discussed above . under these conditions ,",
    "the only signatures of coupling remaining are : ( i ) the appearance of weak @xmath53 resonances , labeled in red as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and ( ii ) the presence of strong low - energy @xmath63 resonances .",
    "these transitions arise from the ground ( indirect ) @xmath63 state , which soon split into ( 1 ) and ( 1 ) and undergo a rapid redshift with decreasing @xmath18 .",
    "thus , at @xmath51 nm we start with a typical spectrum of isolated qds , where @xmath54 and @xmath63 resonances are close in energy , while @xmath53 resonances are a few mev below.@xcite as @xmath18 is reduced , the @xmath63 resonances redshift and approach those of @xmath53 .",
    "we have compared the emission spectrum of @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath63 in asymmetric lateral qdms as a function of the interdot distance . we have shown that tunneling of trions is stronger than that of neutral excitons .",
    "this is because the net coulomb interactions the electron has to overcome in order to tunnel are smaller . as a result , @xmath71 display signatures of molecular coupling at longer interdot distances than @xmath54 .",
    "the signatures include : ( i ) the appearance of additional optical resonances ; ( ii ) the inversion of the ordering of direct trion resonances corresponding to the big and small qds ; ( iii ) the lifting of the degeneracy between indirect trion and neutral exciton resonances ; ( iv ) a pronounced redshift of the indirect @xmath63 resonance , which approaches that of @xmath53 .",
    "we note that signature ( ii ) has been actually observed in recent photoluminescence experiments.@xcite we have also shown that @xmath53 and @xmath63 develop different emission patterns .",
    "these results are particularly valuable in the view of recent experimental progress to control the charge of excitonic complexes in qdms.@xcite it has been recently shown that trions are more sensitive than excitons to electric fields , owing to their net electric charge.@xcite this , together with our results , suggests that current attempts to utilize lateral qdms should focus on trion species rather than neutral excitons . in both positive and negative trions",
    "electron tunneling can be efficient .",
    "yet , positive trions might be less suited because the spin of holes is very sensitive to the in - plane confinement anisotropy.@xcite in a lateral qdm , the @xmath63 ground state contains one hole in each qd . the holes then feel the mutual coulomb repulsion as a source of anisotropic confinement , which translates into spin mixing .",
