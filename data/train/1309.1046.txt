    "saturation problems in graph theory have been studied at length , ever since the paper of erds , hajnal , and moon  @xcite . given a graph @xmath6 , a graph @xmath0 is @xmath6-saturated if @xmath0 does not contain @xmath6 as a subgraph , but the addition of any edge joining two non - adjacent vertices of @xmath0 creates a copy of @xmath6 .",
    "the saturation number of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is the minimum number of edges in an @xmath6-saturated graph on @xmath1 vertices .",
    "the saturation number for complete graphs was determined in  @xcite . a systematic study by kszonyi and tuza  @xcite found the best known general upper bound for @xmath7 in terms of the independence number of @xmath6 .",
    "the saturation number is now known , often precisely , for many graphs ; for these results and related problems in graph theory we refer the reader to the thorough survey of j. faudree , r. faudree , and schmitt  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath8 , quite unlike the turn function @xmath9 , which is often superlinear .    in this paper",
    ", we study a saturation problem for _ drawings _ of graphs . in a drawing of a simple undirected graph @xmath0 in the plane ,",
    "every vertex is represented by a point , and every edge is represented by a curve between the points that correspond to its endpoints . if it does not lead to confusion , these points and curves are also called _ vertices _ and _ edges_. we assume that in a drawing no edge passes through a vertex and no two edges are tangent to each other . a graph , together with its drawing ,",
    "is called a _ simple topological graph _ if any two edges have at most one point in common , which is either their common endpoint or a proper crossing . in general , for any positive integer @xmath4 , it is called a _ @xmath4-simple topological graph _ if any two edges have at most @xmath4 points in common .",
    "we also assume that in a @xmath4-simple topological graph no edge crosses itself . obviously , a @xmath10-simple topological graph is a simple topological graph .",
    "our motivation partly comes from the following problem : at least how many pairwise disjoint edges can one find in every simple topological graph with @xmath1 vertices and @xmath11 edges  @xcite ?",
    "( note that the simplicity condition is essential here , as there are complete topological graphs on @xmath1 vertices and no _ two _ disjoint edges , in which every pair of edges intersect at most twice  @xcite . ) for _ complete _ simple topological graphs , i.e. , when @xmath12 , pach and tth conjectured ( @xcite , page 398 ) that one can always find @xmath13 disjoint edges for a suitable constant @xmath14 .",
    "this was shown by suk @xcite with @xmath15 ; see @xcite for an alternative proof .",
    "recently , ruiz - vargas @xcite has improved this bound to @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , all known proofs break down for _ non - complete _ simple topological graphs . for _ dense _ graphs , i.e. , when @xmath17 for some @xmath18 , fox and sudakov @xcite established the existence of @xmath19 pairwise disjoint edges , with @xmath20 . however , if @xmath21 , the best known lower bound , due to pach and tth @xcite , is only @xmath22 .",
    "we know a great deal about the structure of complete simple topological graphs , but in the non - complete case our knowledge is rather lacunary .",
    "we may try to extend a simple topological graph to a complete one by adding extra edges and then explore the structural information we have for complete graphs .",
    "the results in the present note suggest that this approach is not likely to succeed : there exist very sparse simple topological graphs to which no edge can be added without violating the simplicity condition .",
    "a @xmath4-simple , non - complete topological graph is _ saturated _ if no further edge can be added so that the resulting drawing is still a @xmath4-simple topological graph . in other words , if we connect any two non - adjacent vertices by a curve , it will have at least @xmath23 common points with one of the existing edges .",
    "consider the simple topological graph @xmath24 with eight vertices , depicted in figure  [ kampok ] .",
    "it is easy to verify that the vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 can not be joined by a new edge so that the resulting topological graph remains simple .",
    "indeed , every edge of @xmath24 is incident either to @xmath25 or to @xmath26 , and any curve joining @xmath25 and @xmath26 must cross at least one edge . on the other hand , @xmath24 can be extended to a ( saturated ) simple topological graph in which every pair of vertices except @xmath25 and @xmath26 are connected by an edge .",

    "* fig .  9 ) : the simple topological graph @xmath28 depicted in figure  [ kynclpelda ] has only six vertices , from which @xmath25 and @xmath26 can not be joined by an edge without intersecting one of the original edges at least twice .",
    "again , @xmath28 can be extended to a simple topological graph in which every pair of vertices except @xmath25 and @xmath26 are connected by an edge .",

    "our lower bound in theorem  [ linearbound ] for @xmath3 is weaker than for @xmath59 .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath3 , we could not prove that a saturated @xmath4-simple topological graph can not contain an isolated triangle .",

    "any curve @xmath79 from @xmath543 to @xmath360 has to cross @xmath364 at least @xmath159 times in @xmath356 , and @xmath184 at least @xmath159 times in @xmath84 . in @xmath357 ,",
    "the curve @xmath79 also crosses one of the curves @xmath184 or @xmath364 at least twice , since @xmath364 is folded in @xmath357 .",
