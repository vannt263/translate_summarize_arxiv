    "broadband imaging in the near infrared ( nir ) has enabled the detection of candidate galaxies at redshifts between @xmath15 and 12 , using both recent survey instruments on the hubble space telescope @xcite and wider  but  shallower observations from the ground ( e.g. @xcite , pell et al in prep ) . with specific astrophysics in mind",
    ", these catalogues may be used to infer the cosmic history of star formation , the photon budget available for reionization , and also as an independent test of the re - ionization edge through the prevalence of the hi ly@xmath4  emission line @xcite .",
    "it is vital , therefore , to understand the lower-@xmath2 objects that could contaminate such samples , and the frequency with which they do . at the highest @xmath2 , contamination rates",
    "have been estimated using population synthesis methods @xcite , and shown to be non - negligible .",
    "empirical studies at @xmath16 have also found a population of galaxies with emission lines strong enough to mimic a strong spectral break , suggesting roughly similar contamination levels @xcite . yet",
    "the empirical interloper rate , measured directly by deep spectroscopy in the @xmath17 samples , remains broadly unknown .    to these",
    "ends our group has been carrying out its own multi - wavelength studies , taking advantage of gravitational lensing to search for intrinsically fainter background objects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* l11 ) originally , l11 selected ten lensed galaxies that satisfy criteria for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath0dropout galaxies . with deep optical , near - infrared and spitzer / irac photometry , traditional photometric redshift ( phot-@xmath2 ) methods placed all galaxies in the range @xmath20",
    "however two of the l11 sources were found to lie at @xmath16 @xcite , hinting that strong optical lines may have mimicked a lyman break . in cases where very deep optical imaging is available ,",
    "this source of contamination is thought to be small , as the line strengths imply lowish masses / metallicities that in turn should exhibit blue continuum colours and remain detectable , particularly when stacked .",
    "however other sources of contamination exist , specifically relating to dust attenuation and strong 4000  breaks : in both of these cases an intrinsically red spectrum in the restframe uv and optical may cause a galaxy to go undetected in all bandpasses bluer than the first dropout band .",
    "in this letter we present the optical and nir spectrum of a bright @xmath0band dropout galaxy ( a2667-j1 ) ",
    "phot-@xmath21 , no low-@xmath2 solution and no herschel detection  obtained with vlt / xshooter . in l11 we were skeptical about the very high-@xmath2 interpretation because of the large implied luminosity , and the detection of a faint source in hst/@xmath22 imaging ( although the @xmath23 colour still exceeds @xmath24 magnitudes ) .",
    "however the spectrum shows several strong emission lines that are consistent only with @xmath6 , implying it is an interloper . in sect .",
    "[ sect : data ] we present the new observations and measurements of emission lines . in sect .",
    "[ sect : whatis ] we discuss inferences we can draw from the emission lines , and explanations for the strong spectral break and selection function , and re - model the stellar continuum . in sect .  [ sect : implic ] we discuss the implications that this galaxy may have upon other very high-@xmath2 surveys .",
    "all magnitudes are ab .",
    "a2667-j1 ( @xmath4=23:51:34.9 , @xmath25=26:3:32.7 , j2000 ) was observed with x - shooter @xcite , mounted at ut2 of eso / vlt , on the night of 24 august 2011 .",
    "the total integration time was short , but at @xmath26  s was sufficient to find several strong emission lines .",
    "we used the 1   ( 0.9 ) slit for the uvb channel ( vis and nir ) , providing an almost constant aperture between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 bands .",
    "more importantly the nir spectral resolution of @xmath29 is sufficient to resolve the atmospheric oh airglow lines . between each observation",
    ", the object was dithered along the slit by 2.5 .",
    "the average atmospheric seeing was 0.76 .",
    "data were reduced and combined using the esorex x - shooter pipeline version 1.3.7 , and one dimensional spectra were extracted from the frames using the apall task in noao / iraf with an aperture width of 1.5 .",
    "we clearly identified a strong emission line at wavelength @xmath30  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] )  after masking regions contaminated by a nearby airglow line and fitting a gaussian profile , we measure a flux of @xmath31  erg  s@xmath32  @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath8band magnitude is @xmath34 ( l11 ) , and assuming the quoted bandpass parameters ( @xmath35 , fwhm=2890 ) , we compute an observer frame equivalent width , @xmath36 , of @xmath37 .",
    "the wavelength of the observed emission line falls close to the peak transmission so no filter wing corrections are necessary .",
    "this high @xmath36 restricts the possible line identifications - after testing various possibilities , we determine it to be [ oiii]@xmath3   and also identify ly@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , and h@xmath4 .",
    "this places the redshift of j1 firmly at @xmath6 . after the removal of a nearby oh line [ oiii]@xmath38  is also visible but no heii@xmath39 , [ nii]@xmath406548,6584 , or [ oii]@xmath403726,3729  are visible in either the 1d or 2d spectra .",
    "example spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , and the measured line fluxes ( or limits ) are listed in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    ".a2667-j1 fluxes in emission lines .",
    "[ tab : fluxes ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     with new stellar ( i.e. line - corrected ) photometry , we model the stellar population with _ hyper - z _",
    "@xcite , using the cb2007 modification of the @xcite population synthesis models to generate evolutionary templates .",
    "we adopt a salpeter imf , lock the redshift @xmath6 , and fit dust attenuation , star formation history ( sfh ) , and time since the onset of star formation .",
    "the range of included sfhs include exponentially decaying sfrs with @xmath41-folding timescales as listed in the abscissa of fig  [ fig : fits ] , panel ( b ) .",
    "for comparative purposes we perform fits at three different metallicities : @xmath42 , 0.004 , and 0.02 .",
    "we show the results in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , with histograms of @xmath43 monte carlo realizations in the right panel .",
    "firstly we note that for the three different metallicities , the values of @xmath44 that describe the best fit are effectively consistent , and we do not have the power to distinguish between them .",
    "metallicity does however modulate the frequency with which other results are obtained , and there are two different and entirely degenerate ways of reproducing the break : either with a large dust content or an old population with a strong 4000  break",
    ". the latter scenario would imply a dual stellar population : one evolved enough for a strong break , the other young enough to produce the emission lines .",
    "as usual a strong 4000  break is more frequently seen at higher metallicities , where stellar evolution runs faster",
    ". indeed models at extremely low @xmath45 prefer the young dusty solution in @xmath46% of cases , models at @xmath47 seem to be rather evenly split between the young / dusty vs. old solutions , and the @xmath48 models almost exclusively prefer ages above 2  gyr and little dust .",
    "the @xmath42 models are rejected by three arguments : ( _ i. _ ) the necessary attenuation is higher than permitted from h@xmath4/h@xmath5   ( sect  [ sect : whatislines ] ) , while usually nebular @xmath49  exceeds that of the stars @xcite ; ( _ ii . _ ) such metallicities should produce higher [ oiii]/h@xmath5 ; and ( _ iii .",
    "_ ) a dusty metal - poor galaxy seems an unlikely combination .",
    "however the @xmath47 models all seem permissible , and we do not have the information to formally distinguish between the two scenarios .",
    "we note that in the case of the composite population , the recent burst must also have a stellar population that has not been subtracted from the photometry prior to fitting .",
    "indeed its contribution to the @xmath0band flux is not permitted to be large , otherwise the @xmath50 break would be diminished . to investigate this we take the restframe h@xmath4  ew ( 280 ) and compute the range of ages at which this ew is exceeded :",
    "the star - forming population must have an age below @xmath51myr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ starburst99 _ ) . over this age range",
    "we then compute the range of permitted @xmath52 magnitudes and without reddening the population will remain completely undetected in @xmath52 for ages below 2  myr .",
    "however the h@xmath4ew is independent of reddening while the @xmath53 colour is not ; the @xmath54 limit of @xmath49  allows up to a factor of 3 greater attenuation at @xmath52 than at @xmath55 and ages up to 4  myr still predict a @xmath0band non - detection . on the other hand",
    ", a rather blue continuum may explain the hst @xmath22 detection .",
    "for this range in parameter space , the burst contributes between 0.4 and 4  % of the total stellar mass .",
    "although the irac channels show the largest errors , the 5.8  channel carries a residual of @xmath56 .",
    "we note that the higher metallicity stars show the strongest 1.6  stellar feature , which is probably the cause of the marginal preference for these models .",
    "however the irac points also contain the paschen and brackett lines , for which we also make a first order attempt to correct ( assuming @xmath43k gas ) .",
    "since the nebular extinction is not well constrained , we make two corrections , one derived for @xmath49=0 and the other for @xmath49=0.5 . these modified points are shown in fig  [ fig : fits ] and the largest correction ( where pa@xmath4 falls in 5.8 ) amounts to just 0.06 magnitudes - consequently the corrections in channels 1 and 2 are not visible .",
    "we do not re - perform the sed fit , but note that this correction does just bring the channel 3 data point to about @xmath54 of the fit .",
    "finally we examine the phot-@xmath2 solutions that are allowed by the new line - free photometry , and we repeat the fits with the redshift free .",
    "the peak at @xmath57 is still recovered but now represents the tertiary solution .",
    "the primary solution lies at @xmath58 which is actually in good agreement with the secondary peak from l11 ( @xmath59 ) , and the secondary grouping prefers @xmath60 .",
    "however , more interestingly , only 0.2% of the realizations have phot-@xmath2 within @xmath54 of the spectroscopically measured value , and it is not easy to obtain a good sed fit at the measured redshift when the templates comprise only single stellar populations .",
    "this lends support to the scenario of multiple populations , and the hypothesis that the @xmath22 and nir detections do not see the same stars .",
    "a2667-j1 can be described in two ways , but regardless of the true population , one salient fact remains : was photometrically selected as a @xmath61 candidate , but actually lies at @xmath13 .",
    "because of our homogeneous coverage across the nir , j1 was selected in two colour space : ( @xmath50 ) and ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the selection , therefore , is more similar to lower @xmath2 methods ( e.g. @xmath18 and @xmath19dropouts ) and somewhat different from other @xmath0drop searches @xcite , which lack comparably deep @xmath28band data and therefore employ a one - colour selection .",
    "the requirement of @xmath63 ( a blue uv slope ) is specifically intended to fortify the selection against the inclusion of mid-@xmath2 galaxies with strong optical breaks , but a @xmath13 galaxy is precisely what we have found . on the other hand , a non - detection in bandpasses bluewards of the break",
    "is also required by typical surveys to reject lower-@xmath2 galaxies and , while j1 is undetected in ground - based @xmath2 , @xmath64 , and @xmath52 imaging , it is detected in hst @xmath22 ( albeit with a colour similar to the dropout criterion ) . for j1 , imaging bluer than the @xmath2 band",
    "would be effectively useless in evaluating its status as an interloper : from the best - fitting seds and monte carlo simulations described in sect .",
    "[ sect : whatismodel ] , we calculate that in the hst f435w and f606w ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) we would need to reach depths of ab=30.2 and 29.5 in order to detect the continuum . in other words ,",
    "this relatively bright @xmath8detected @xmath0drop would need imaging with the depth of the hubble ultra deep field @xcite to be rejected as very high-@xmath2 .",
    "a magnitude @xmath67 galaxy of these colours in the hudf or candels surveys would still remain undetected by in the available hst @xmath18band imaging , and require imaging reaching @xmath68 in order to detect the bluer continuum .",
    "it currently remains unclear how abundant galaxies of this type are , and thus systematic campaigns of spectroscopic followup will remain a vital pursuit , even at the faintest magnitudes .",
