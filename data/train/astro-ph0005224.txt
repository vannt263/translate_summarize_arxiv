    "to constrain the physical parameters of extended x - ray sources ( e.g. groups and clusters of galaxies ) , the observed surface brightness can be either geometrically deprojected or , more simply , fitted with a model obtained from an assumed distribution of the gas density .    given the hydrostatic equilibrium within the cluster , the gravitational potential supports both the gas and the galaxies distribution .",
    "if the latter is approximated via the king approximation ( 1962 ) to the inner portions of an isothermal sphere ( lane - emden equation in binney & tremaine 1987 ) , the gas density is then written as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the core radius of the distribution .    the surface brightness profile observed at the projected radius @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is the projection on the sky of the plasma emissivity , @xmath8 : @xmath9    the emissivity is equal to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the proton density and the cooling function , @xmath12 , depends upon the mechanism of the emission ( mainly due to bremsstrahlung at @xmath13 kev ) .    assuming isothermality and a @xmath14-model for the gas density ( eq .  [ eq : rho_b ] ) , the surface brightness profile has an analytic solution ( eq .",

    "the @xmath0model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 , 1978 ) provides a good representation of the observed surface brightness and has the advantage to easily constrain the gas density distribution .    elsewhere",
    "( ettori 2000 ) , i consider the effect of the presence of a temperature gradient in the estimate of the @xmath0model parameters . in this paper , i will focus on the deficiency of the @xmath0model in modeling in a satisfactory way the central emission from cooling flow clusters of galaxies .    the cooling flows ( e.g. sarazin 1988 , fabian 1994 ) result in an enhancement of the gas density in the central region due to the high cooling efficiency in the cluster core .",
    "recently , there have been attempts to model this excess in emission with a generic double @xmath0model , i.e. the sum of two components of surface brightness ( ikebe et al . 1996 , xu et al . 1998 , mohr et al .",
    "1999 , reiprich & bhringer 1999 ) .",
    "the correlation between the presence of a cooling flow and the necessity for a second @xmath0model is well indicated from this figure : peres et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that 40 per cent of a flux limited sample of 55 clusters of galaxies has a deposition rate of more than 100 @xmath18 yr@xmath19 ; this is the same percentage of the clusters in the mohr et al .",
    "sample that are better modeled with a double @xmath0model instead of a single one ( 18 out of 45 clusters ) .",
    "the double @xmath0model as sum of two @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ eq : beta ] , however , is not physically meaningful .",
    "in fact , a single isothermal temperature is usually assumed for both different density components that , therefore , are not in equilibrium .",
    "moreover , data with high spatial resolution do not show evidence of a second inner core radius .",
    "i present in this work a simple geometrical and physical model of the emission from cooling flow clusters of galaxies .",
    "this model relies on recent spectral evidence that the cluster plasma can be described as a gas with two phases , one related to the cooling gas and the other to the ambient medium . assuming that the extended intracluster gas density , @xmath20 , is well described by a @xmath0model , i show in the following section that an analytic expression for @xmath7 can be obtained to describe the surface brightness from cooling flow clusters of galaxies . in section  3 ,",
    "i apply this model to real data of clusters with or without cooling flows .",
    "this model allows to handle the emissivity due to each component .",
    "i discuss the physical implications of this in section  4 . in section  5",
    ", i present some concluding remarks .",
    "recent spectral analyses of cooling flow clusters of galaxies ( allen et al .",
    "2000 , white 2000 ) have shown how the spectral capabilities of the present instruments are unable to resolve all the fine structures of a multiphase gas , allowing just a modeling with a two - phase component , one that describes the emission from the central cooling gas and the other that takes into account the extended emission from the ambient medium .",
    "these observational results provide us with a simple and natural model for the total cluster emission : an inner cold phase confined within @xmath21 and overlapping the diffuse , ambient gas ( see fig .",
    "[ 2phase ] ) .",
    "we assume that the two components coexist within @xmath1 , whereas only the ambient plasma fills the cluster volume shell at radius above @xmath1 .",
    "the total cluster emissivity is then @xmath22 , where @xmath23 from the definition in eq .",
    "[ eq : em ] .",
    "this simple model provides an analytic expression for the surface brightness profile defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : sb ] : @xmath24 where the integration limits in @xmath25 contains the boundary of the inner region at @xmath21 .",
    "now , i integrate the emissivity along the line of sight .",
    "@xmath26 is still eq .",
    "[ eq : beta ] . to integrate @xmath25",
    ", one needs the assumption that the only scale parameter of the gas density is the dimension of the cooling region , @xmath1 . considering that we are in the regime @xmath27",

    "\\label{eq : np_cool}\\ ] ] the behavior of this profile ensures that the gas density within the cooling region has no other parameter scale than the dimension of the region itself and @xmath29 goes to zero when @xmath30 .",
    "then , i can integrate analytically @xmath25 ( eq .  3.196.3 in gradshteyn and ryzhik 1965 ) : @xmath31^{0.5 + 3\\beta_{\\rm cool } } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "s_{\\rm cool}(0 ) & = & n^2_{\\rm 0 , cool } r_{\\rm cool } \\lambda(t_{\\rm cool } ) b(0.5 , 3\\beta_{\\rm cool}+1 ) ,   \\label{eq : s_cool}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the equations above , @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the two gas temperatures corresponding to the cooling region and to the ambient of the cluster , respectively .",
    "i have applied this model to observations of clusters of galaxies that can map the emission in regions well beyond the cluster core to disentangle the effect of the two components .",
    "moreover , i have considered clusters with evidence of a large cooling flow and the coma cluster ( ror : rp800005n00 , exposure time : 20.0 ksec , @xmath34 ) , a well - known example of a no - cooling flow cluster . in particular , i have analyzed , as described in ettori and fabian ( 1999 ) , the _ rosat _ pspc images of a1795 ( ror : rp800105n00 , exposure time : 33.3 ksec , @xmath35 ) and a2199 ( ror : rp800644n00 , exposure time : 33.9 ksec , @xmath36 ) , that have a deposition rate larger than 100 @xmath18 yr@xmath19 ( allen et al . 2000 ) and present in the literature detailed spectral analyses of the _ asca _ dataset to be used as reference .    in table  1 , i quote the results obtained by fitting the azimuthally averaged profiles of the surface brightness between 0 and @xmath37 , where the brightness value is larger than 3 times the uncertainty in that radial bin .",
    "i perform the following fits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) : ( i ) single @xmath0model , ( ii ) the double @xmath0model presented here with 6 parameters @xmath38 $ ] , ( iii ) the double @xmath0model with 5 parameters , i.e. fixing @xmath39 .",
    "the decrease of the @xmath40 is significant where a cooling flow is present . where this decrease is not meaningful ( or not present ) , like in coma cluster , the single @xmath0model still represents a good description of the data .    where a two - phase model provides a significantly better fit",
    ", i find that the f  test shows no statistical improvement with a 6 parameters fit ( cf .",
    "table  1 ) .",
    "therefore , i use in the following considerations the best fit results obtained with a 5 parameters fit , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the present observational results .",
    "allen ( 2000 ) quotes the cooling radii obtained from deprojection analysis of 30 cooling flow clusters images .",
    "ettori & fabian ( 1999 ) estimate the core radii for 23 of these clusters using a single @xmath0model over the radial range [ 0.1 , 1 ] @xmath41 , the radius at which the mean cluster density is 500 the background value .",
    "the distribution of the ratio , @xmath42 , has a median value of 1.33 , an average of 1.61 and a standard deviation of 1.19 , and can be considered consistent with @xmath43 . for the clusters in exam here ,",
    "i measure a @xmath42 ratio of 1.32@xmath44 , 90 per cent confidence level ) and 0.84 @xmath45 for a1795 and a2199 , respectively .",
    "i remind , however , that i am using a different definition of @xmath1 than the one adopted in the standard spatial analysis : in the latter , @xmath1 is the radius where the cluster cooling time first exceeds the hubble time , whereas in this work @xmath1 defines the boundary of the central cool phase of the gas .",
    "it is worth to note that another version of a ` 5 parameters ' fit , in which @xmath46 is fixed equal to @xmath47 and @xmath48 are left free to vary , provides a significantly worse @xmath40 than the one obtained by using the ` 5 parameters ' fit adopted here .",
    "finally , the @xmath40 obtained with the models above does not vary significantly from the @xmath40 measured after the fit with other models which are not strictly based upon a physical framework , like the sum of two standard @xmath0models with 6 free parameters ( e.g. reiprich & bhringer 1999 ) or , fixed the slope to a common value , with 5 free parameters ( mohr et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     appreciable corrections can also affect @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the terms of the so - called @xmath0problem ( mushotzky 1984 , edge & stewart 1991 ) due to the variation of the @xmath14 value ( for a1795 and a2199 , @xmath47 increases by 20 and 10 per cent when compared to the @xmath51 model fit results , respectively ) . in the two - phases model described here , it is simple to calculate the gas and the total mass : @xmath49 is the integral of @xmath52 upon the cluster volume and , in particular , @xmath53 where @xmath54 for a1795 ( a2199 ) for an assumed @xmath55 ; the total gravitating mass is given by the application of the hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath56 and is proportional to @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "i have presented a new analytic formula to model the total surface brightness profile of clusters of galaxies where a two - phases intracluster gas can be assumed .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the present results of spectral analyses of the central regions of clusters that harbour a cooling flow .",
    "the use of this formula allows to properly disentangle the contribution of the cooling flow to the cluster emissivity using only the spatial distribution of the x - ray photons . after removing the contamination from the cooling flow ,",
    "i show how some relevant physical parameters are affected , like , for example , the ambient gas temperature ( see table  2 ) . in a forthcoming paper , i will investigate the systematic changes in the temperature , luminosity and mass ( cf .",
    "table  3 ) of a sample of clusters of galaxies and how these variations affect the relations among these quantities .",
