    "the study of the light mesons is a rich and active field which provides valuable insights into strong interactions taking place at energies where perturbative quantum chromodynamics is no longer valid .",
    "instead effective field theories or dispersion relation calculations can be used .",
    "both of these however need experimental results either as input or as a verification of predictions .",
    "the kloe detector is situated at the @xmath6 collider da@xmath7ne which operates in the @xmath8 meson mass region .",
    "the huge available data sets are ideal when searching for the forbidden decay channel @xmath9 .",
    "the possibility of such a measurement is presented in the first study below .    at these centre of mass energies",
    "there is also a large amount of @xmath0 mesons produced , either accompanied by an initial state radiation photon or through the @xmath5 production reaction . in the second study presented below both these production channels",
    "are used when estimating how many events of the @xmath2 decay can be found . in the third study only the @xmath5 production channel is used to investigate the dynamics of the dominant @xmath0 decay channel , @xmath4 .",
    "the decay @xmath11 would violate c - parity in electromagnetic interactions and thus the reaction is not expected to occur .",
    "currently the upper limit of the branching ratio for the reaction is br@xmath12 at 84% c.l .",
    ", measured in a bubble chamber experiment performed in the lawrence radiation laboratory in 1966 @xcite .",
    "the production reaction @xmath13 has the same final state particles and is the most important background for @xmath14 . with small changes of the centre of mass energy ,",
    "the change in the cross section for the background reaction @xmath13 should be minimal .",
    "however , the cross section of a @xmath11 decay should vanish when under the @xmath8 meson threshold .",
    "therefore , it becomes plausible to look for the @xmath11 decay by measuring the @xmath15 final state cross section around the @xmath8 meson threshold .    in this study , a data sample of @xmath16 fb@xmath17 recorded at @xmath18 mev / c@xmath19 has been used .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is detected by looking for its most common decay mode @xmath20 .",
    "the preselection requires at least three neutral energy deposits in the calorimeter not associated to charged tracks ; the most energetic one is required to have an energy of @xmath21 mev .",
    "additionally two charged tracks with opposite curvature are required to be detected in the drift chamber . after the preselection about @xmath22 events remain in the monte carlo sample , where 70302 events originate from @xmath13 .    to suppress non-@xmath15 background , ( i ) exactly three photons",
    "are required , ( ii ) the photon pair with invariant mass closest to the @xmath23 one is searched for , and ( iii ) cuts on the energy of the photon recoiling against the omega and on the angle between this photon and the @xmath0 flight direction are applied .    after the background cuts",
    "the @xmath24 channel has been reduced by 46% , while the sum of all events have been reduced by 97% .    in fig .",
    "[ mass ] , the @xmath25 invariant mass from data is compared to the background expectation from monte carlo .",
    "studies are ongoing to further suppress background and find a better agreement between data and monte carlo simulations .",
    "the magnetic moment of the muon is one of the most precisely measured quantity in particle physics .",
    "however , the experimental value deviates from its theoretical prediction @xcite    light - meson transition form factors could potentially play a role in the theoretical prediction of the magnetic moment of muons .",
    "one of the main models used to predict such form factors is the vector meson dominance model .",
    "however , for the @xmath27 form factor this model shows a large deviation from the values measured by na60 experiment in the decay @xmath28@xcite .",
    "alternative theoretical approaches @xcite , attempting to describe the transition form factors of light - meson decays , give better correspondence to the na60 data and only fails in the higher energy region .",
    "but on the other hand they are not able to reproduce the recent kloe preliminary measurement of the form factor of @xmath29 . for the solution of this puzzle",
    "a second high statistics measurement of the @xmath30 form factor would be advisable . here",
    "we present the expected yields for the signal events using existing kloe data .",
    "a preliminary study has been performed to evaluate the number of @xmath31 events in the @xmath32 and the @xmath33 production channels expected in the same data sample of @xmath16 fb@xmath17 used in the previous study .",
    "in addition to taking into account the geometrical acceptance of the kloe detector , the study also includes the preselection critera : two charged tracks with opposite curvature , at least three charged clusters and one cluster with deposited energy of @xmath21 mev .    it is found that @xmath34 @xmath35 decays and @xmath36 @xmath28 decays are expected in the kloe data .",
    "these number of events were deemed not satisfactory and more data are needed to perform such a measurement .",
    "the kloe collaboration has published a measurement of the @xmath5 production reaction where @xmath37 events of @xmath4 were found @xcite .",
    "this sample could in principle be used to study the decay dynamics .",
    "a three particle final state decay is studied using a dalitz plot .",
    "the normalised dalitz plot variables , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are produced as follows , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is kinetic energy of the final state particle @xmath43 in rest frame of the decaying particle and @xmath44 . for a distribution which in an @xmath45-plot is symmetrically shaped around the centre one can instead use the polar",
    "coordinates , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath4 decay includes three main effects .",
    "firstly the three pions are produced predominantly in a p - wave state .",
    "this is the prevalent feature of the dalitz plot distribution which was used to determine the @xmath0 meson quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "secondly the @xmath48 meson plays a role as an intermediate two pion state .",
    "thirdly , any final state @xmath49 interactions might also affect the density distribution .",
    "the last two effects are subtle and have not yet been established since the previous experiments lacked the required statistics .",
    "two recently developed theoretical models have made predictions for this density distribution @xcite@xcite that could only be tested using a high statistics experimental dalitz plot distribution , which the data collected by kloe could provide .",
    "a challenge with the data set presented here consists of the interference caused by interaction between the two final state @xmath23 .",
    "the impact of this interference has been investigated using simulated data and the result will be presented here . in the previous kloe analysis",
    "the process @xmath50 has been described using the vmd matrix element , @xmath51 + ( p_{0_1 } \\longleftrightarrow p_{0_2 } ) \\right|^2 \\nonumber\\\\   = & |\\mathbf{j}_{\\omega\\pi^0_1 } + \\mathbf{j}_{\\omega\\pi^0_2}|^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : me2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each @xmath52 term accounts for a specific charge of the @xmath48 and permutation of the two final state @xmath23 s , for details see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 interference is given by the mixed term @xmath53 .",
    "to check the magnitude of its influence on the density distribution of the dalitz plot two data sets were simulated , one with the full matrix element , @xmath54 , and one where the mixing term was excluded , i.e. only the term @xmath55 was used .",
    "the main difference between these two matrix elements manifests in the kinematical distributions of the neutral pions .",
    "the effect on the density distribution of the @xmath4 dalitz plot is shown in fig.[fig : w3pidp ] . the distribution given by the full matrix element",
    "is normalised to the distribution given by the matrix element without the mixing term .",
    "the maximum deviation reaches @xmath56 for negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "this interference could lead to difficulties in the extraction of the @xmath4 dalitz plot density and subsequently in experimental verification of the theoretical predictions .",
    "one solution comes from the symmetry of the density distribution in the dalitz plot which allows for using only part of the plot to predict the full shape .",
    "therefore the minimally disturbed part of the distribution could still be used as an experimental result of the dalitz plot shape .",
    "it is worth to mention that recently the kloe-2 detector @xcite upgraded with new detectors @xcite started the data taking campaign and the newly installed inner tracker detector @xcite will improve vertex resolution for charged tracks originating from @xmath0 decay .",
    "+ we warmly thank our former kloe colleagues for the access to the data collected during the kloe data taking campaign .",
