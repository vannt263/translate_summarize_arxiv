    "cosmic acceleration can arise from either an exotic form of energy with negative pressure , referred to as  dark energy \" , or a modification of gravity manifesting on large scales . as shown in @xcite , at the the background level dark energy and modified gravity models are almost indistinguishable",
    ", hence one needs to investigate the perturbation dynamics .",
    "the studies of perturbation theory in modified gravity models , in principle , can be classified in two different frameworks : the parametrization approach and the non - parametrization method , such as the principal component analysis  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the former . there",
    "exist several phenomenological / theory - oriented parametrizations of modified gravity , such as the bertschinger - zukin @xcite and the brax - davis - li - winther @xcite parametrizations .",
    "these parametrizations are mainly suitable for the quasi - static regime , where the time evolution of the gravitational potentials is negligible compared with their spatial gradient .",
    "furthermore , if we focus on the linear fluctuation dynamics , for which the equations in fourier space can be reduced to simple algebraic relations , these techniques allow us to perform some analytic calculations which make the parametrization technically efficient .",
    "however , if we want to go beyond the quasi - static regime , while remaining in the linear perturbation framework , the parametrization of modified gravity becomes more complex .",
    "this is because on the largest scales , especially the super / near - horizon scales , the time evolution of the gravitational potentials is no longer negligible , the time derivative terms dominate the dynamical equations , which means that we need to solve some temporal ordinary differential equations .",
    "actually , there exists some debate about the range of validity of the various parametrizations .",
    "for example , on one hand , as shown in @xcite , using a parametrization with insufficient freedom significantly tightens the apparent theoretical constraints . on the other hand ,",
    "for some specific modified gravity models some phenomenological parametrizations works quite well ; for instance the authors of @xcite recently demonstrated that for the small compton wavelength case in the @xmath0 model , the bertschinger - zukin parametrization @xcite is practically good enough for the current data analysis purpose .",
    "this is because , on the scales larger than the compton wavelength the deviation from general relativity is suppressed . below the compton",
    "scale the gravitational potential growth is enhanced and the two metric potentials are no longer equal .",
    "consequently , for the small compton wavelength case , whose value is less than current horizon size , the most significant modifications w.r.t .",
    "general relativity occur in the sub - horizon regime .",
    "in addition to the above explicit parametrizations , some quite generic frameworks to study different modified gravity scenarios have also been proposed , such as the parameterized post - friedmann ( ppf ) formalism , including the hu - sawicki approach @xcite , its calibration version @xcite and baker - ferreira - skordis - zuntz algorithm @xcite , and effective field theory ( eft ) approaches @xcite .    on the observational point of view , many windows have been proposed to constrain modified gravity models , such as the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect  @xcite in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , including cmb power spectrum @xcite , cmb isw - lensing bispectrum @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurements @xcite , the galaxy - isw cross correlation  @xcite , cluster abundance  @xcite , peculiar velocity  @xcite , redshift - space distortions  @xcite , weak - lensing  @xcite , @xmath14 cm lines  @xcite , matter power spectrum and bispectrum  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recently some n - body simulation algorithms in modified gravity models have been developed  @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , with wmap resolution the modification effects on the cmb mainly come from the isw effect , which becomes prominent on the largest scales .",
    "however , due to the unavoidable cosmic variance on large scales , the constraints from these effects are not significant . on the other hand ,",
    "since the typical modification scales are in the sub - horizon regime , several studies show that the most stringent constraints come from the large - scale structure data sets .",
    "for example , the strongest current constraint on @xmath0 gravity ( @xmath15 )  @xcite is obtained through cluster abundance data sets .",
    "various previous results show that the main constraint on modified gravity comes from galaxy or cluster scales which corresponds to the multipole range @xmath16 in cmb data , where lensing effect is no longer negligible .",
    "the recent release of _ planck _ data @xcite provides us with a fruitful late - time information both on the isw and lensing scales , which is encoded in the cmb temperature power - spectrum @xcite and lensing potential power - spectrum @xcite and cmb temperature isw - lensing bispectrum @xcite .",
    "the full sky lensing potential map has been firstly measured and the significance of the amplitude of the lensing potential power - spectrum arrives at the @xmath17 level .",
    "the isw - lensing bispectrum is also firstly detected with nearly @xmath18 significance .",
    "furthermore , through the lensing potential reconstruction and the isw - lensing bispectrum , the isw effect is also firstly detected via the cmb itself .",
    "all in all , with its high resolution the _ planck _ mission provides us with fruitful information about the universe late - time acceleration .",
    "for example , the authors of @xcite shows that the joint analysis of _ planck _ and bao data could greatly improve the brans - dicke parameter @xmath19 constraint .",
    "further new constraint results related with modified gravity / dark energy can be found in @xcite .    due to these considerations , in this paper",
    "we investigate the power of the _ planck _ data sets in constraining modified gravity scenarios . in order to break the parameter degeneracies , apart from _",
    "planck _ data sets , we also use some external astrophysical data sets , such as bao measurements from the 6dfgs , sdss dr7 and boss dr9 surveys , @xmath1 from hst measurement and supernovae from union2.1 compilation .",
    "we also use wmap9yr data for consistency check and comparison . because of the simplicity of the bertschinger - zukin parametrization , in this paper we study the modified gravity theory through this method .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , a large class of modified gravity theories , e.g. , chameleon @xcite , symmetron @xcite and dilaton @xcite models can be characterized by the mass of a suitable scalar field and the coupling between the scalar field and baryonic / dark matter components . in the einstein frame , where the gravitational sector is the standard einstein - hilbert action ,",
    "the scalar field is exponentially coupled with the matter sector s_e&=&^4x + & + & s_i(_i , e^-_i()g_),where the einstein frame metric @xmath20 is related to the jordan frame one @xmath21 through a conformal transformation g_=e^_i()g_,and @xmath22 denotes the matter components .",
    "inspired by some nice properties in the quasi - static regime of @xmath0 model , bertschinger and zukin in @xcite first write the two gravitational potentials in the conformal newtonian gauge .",
    "] in terms of two observation - related variables , the time- and scale - dependent newton s constant @xmath23 and the so - called gravitational slip @xmath24 [ bz ] k^2&= & -4ga^2(a , k ) , + [ bz1.2 ] & = & ( a , k ) , where @xmath25 is the newton s constant in the laboratory .",
    "the corresponding einstein - boltzmann solver named _ mgcamb _ is implemented in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we implement the same algorithm in the new version of _ camb _ @xcite which is compatible with the _ planck _ likelihood .    in the following sections",
    ", we will study @xmath0 gravity and the quite general chameleon - type model in the framework of the bertschinger - zukin parameterized modified gravity method , by using the _ planck _",

    "the appearance of the upper dark gray area is due to the non - linear dependence of the isw effect on @xmath2.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     the likelihood of @xmath2 .",

    "there exist two more reasons for the interest it attracted .",
    "one is that the form of the function @xmath0 can be engineered to exactly mimic _ any _ background history via a one - parameter family of solutions  @xcite .",
    "the second reason is that @xmath0 gravity can slightly better fit than at @xmath13cdm , which can be attributed to the lowering of the temperature anisotropy power spectrum at small @xmath26 regime  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the class of @xmath0 gravity models which can mimic a @xmath13cdm background .    because of the higher order derivative nature of @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "there exist a scalar degree of freedom , named scalaron @xmath27 with mass [ fr_mass ] m^2_f_r=(-r).then the compton wavelength of the scalaron reads [ comp_wav1 ] _",
    "f_rm^-1_f_r.usually , it is convenient to use the dimensionless compton wavelength [ comp_wav2 ] br,with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in the bertschinger - zukin parametrization @xcite , the explicit expressions of the functions @xmath30 and @xmath24 for @xmath0 gravity read [ bz2.1 ] ( a , k ) & = & , + [ bz2.2 ] ( a , k ) & = & , based on the quasi - static approximation .",
    "the above parametrization is improved by giannantonio _ et .",
    "_ in  @xcite to take the isw effect into account through some empirical formula [ bz3 ] ( a , k ) = .",
    "due to this reason , in our numerical calculation we use ( [ bz3 ] ) instead of the original expression ( [ bz2.1 ] ) .    through a few simple computations , one can easily find that @xmath31 is nothing but the present compton wavelength @xmath32 .",
    "remember that song _ et .",
    "_ in @xcite pointed out that there exists a one - parameter family solution in @xmath0 gravity which could mimic any background evolution .",
    "conventionally , we choose this one - parameter family labeled by the compton wavelength at present @xmath2 or @xmath33 in the bertschinger - zukin parametrization . given the above analysis , we can see that in @xmath0 gravity , compared with the concordance @xmath13cdm model , there is only one extra parameter , @xmath2 , which makes the effects of gravitational modification quite manifest .",

    ", it is straightforward to generalize the bertschinger - zukin parametrization for @xmath0 gravity ( [ bz2.1 ] ) and ( [ bz2.2 ] ) into [ bz4.1 ] ( a , k ) & = & , + [ bz4.2 ] ( a , k ) & = & , where the parameters need to satisfy the following relation [ relation ] _ 1==2-_2 , and @xmath36 .",
    "via the above constraints the number of free parameters can be reduced to @xmath37 , usually , one choose them as ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "in @xcite this kind of parametrization is called yukawa - type models , due to the yukawa - type interaction between dark matter particles .    because of the non - minimal coupling , the dynamics of the scalar field is determined jointly by the scalar field and the matter component , for example",
    ", the effective potential of the scalar field is defined by v_eff ( ) = v ( ) + |_i e^_i(),which gives an effective mass of chameleon field m^2 = v_eff = v  - (  + ^2)v,where primes denote differentiation w.r.t . the field . for simplicity , here we assume that the chameleon field couples to all the matter components uniformly .",
    "following some calculations as in @xcite , we can obtain the following relations ^1+s/2 & = & , + _ 1 ^ 2 & = & , + _ 2 ^ 2 & = & ( 1 + ) , + _ 1 & = & 1 + , + _ 2 & = & , where @xmath39 is the chameleon effective mass at present .",
    "furthermore , for the inverse power - law potential @xmath40 case , with @xmath41 , we have n=.here @xmath31 can be replaced with the conventional parameter @xmath2 , with the same expression in @xmath0 model , namely @xmath32 . through the above relations , we can easily see that the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 correspond to the non - minimally coupling between chameleon field and matter sector , the relative compton wavelength of chameleon field and the potential index of chameleon field , respectively .",
    "moreover , the general relativity limit corresponds to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the non - linear dependence of the isw effect on @xmath2 in @xmath0 gravity.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the purpose of this paper is to test possible deviations from general relativity on various cosmic scales by using the recent _ planck _ data , including both the cmb temperature and lensing potential power - specta and also some external astrophysical data sets . in the following section",
    ", we will briefly review the _ planck _ likelihood and data set which we used in this work .    the total _ planck _",
    "cmb temperature power - spectrum likelihood is divided into low-@xmath26 ( @xmath43 ) and high-@xmath26 ( @xmath44 ) parts .",
    "this is because the central limit theorem ensures that the distribution of cmb angular power spectrum @xmath45 in the high-@xmath26 regime can be well approximated by a gaussian statistics .",
    "however , for the low-@xmath26 part the @xmath45 distribution is non - gaussian . for these reasons the _ planck _ team adopts two different methodologies to build the likelihood . in detail ,",
    "for the low-@xmath26 part , the likelihood exploits all _ planck _ frequency channels from @xmath46 to @xmath47 ghz , separating the cosmological cmb signal from diffuse galactic foregrounds through a physically motivated bayesian component separation technique . for the high-@xmath26 part , the _",
    "team employ a correlated gaussian likelihood approximation , based on a fine - grained set of angular cross - spectra derived from multiple detector combinations between the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ghz frequency channels , marginalizing over power - spectrum foreground templates . in order to break the well - known parameter degeneracy between the reionization optical depth @xmath51 and the scalar index @xmath52 , the _ planck _ team assumed the low-@xmath26 wmap polarization likelihood ( wp ) . apart from the cmb power - spectrum , the first _ planck _",
    "data release provides for the first time a full - sky lensing potential map , by using the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ghz frequency bands with an overall significance greater than @xmath17 .",
    "as we know , the lensing potential distribution follows that of the large - scale structures which form and grow mainly in the late - time universe .",
    "thus , this map carries fruitful information about dark energy / modified gravity in this period .",
    "hence , we expect that the lensing potential power - spectrum could provide us with a stringent constraint on deviations from general relativity .",
    "given the above considerations , we perform our parameter estimation algorithms by using two different data sets from the _ planck _ mission , namely the _ planck _",
    "cmb power - spectrum @xcite and lensing potential power - spectrum @xcite .",
    "in order to compare with the previous wmap results , we also do the same analysis by using the wmap9yr data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to break the parameter degeneracies we also use some other external data sets , including baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurements from the 6dfgs @xcite , sdss dr7 @xcite , and boss dr9 @xcite surveys , hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project @xcite @xmath1 measurement and supernovae from union2.1 compilation @xcite . for bao data sets , we use three redshift",

    "we use the result @xmath56 @xcite , which comes from the supernova magnitude - redshift relation calibrated by the hst observations of cepheid variables in the host galaxies of eight sne ia . for supernovae , we use the union2.1 compilation , consisting of 580 sne , calibrated by the salt2 light - curve fitting model .",
    "the global analysis results for @xmath0 gravity can be read in the second , third , fourth and fifth columns of tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] , which are based on wmap9yr , _ planck _ + wp , and _ planck _",
    "+ wp + lensing and _ planck _ + wp + lensing + bao + hst + union2.1 data sets .",
    "firstly , we can see that _ planck _",
    "cmb temperature power - spectrum with wp can give an upper bound of @xmath6 ( hereafter we quote the significance at @xmath57c.l .",
    "for modified gravity parameter , such as @xmath2 and @xmath34 ) . compared with the wmap9yr result , @xmath3",
    ", it improves the upper bound by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , by adding lensing data the results can be further improved by a factor @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "finally , we arrive at our best bound of @xmath9 by using all data sets .",
    "in addition , we notice that , due to the degeneracy between @xmath2 and the dark matter density , the _ planck _",
    "data prefer a slightly lower value of @xmath58 in @xmath0 model .",
    "consequently , this implies that @xmath0 gravity favors a slightly larger value of @xmath1",
    ". this can be helpful to relax the tension between _ planck _ and the other direct measurements of the hubble parameter , such as that from the hst @xcite .",
    "the degenearcy between @xmath2 and @xmath58 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 3rdpeak ] , where it is evident that we can fit a lower value of the third peak by increasing @xmath2 while keeping @xmath58 fixed .    marginalized likelihoods for all the parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ mg_1d ] .",
    "we also highlight the 2d likelihood in the parameter space of @xmath2 and @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ b0_h0 ] and the marginalized likelihood for @xmath2 in fig .",
    "let us notice that the @xmath2 likelihood from wmap9yr data ( gray curve ) has a prominent second peak around @xmath59 .",
    "this is due to the non - linear dependence of the isw effect on @xmath2 in @xmath0 gravity . since with wmap resolution",
    "the lensing signal is quite weak , the main contribution to the @xmath2 constraint in wmap data comes from the isw effect . as shown in fig .",
    "[ isw ] , under our parameter value choice ( we fix all the other cosmological parameters as the mean values of the _ planck _ base @xmath13cdm model ) , from @xmath60 to @xmath61 the slope of the spectrum in the isw - dominated regime becomes gradually flat and approaches the sachs - wolfe plateau .",
    "after that , if one continues to increase till @xmath62 , the power - spectrum will bounce again and get closer to that of general relativity .",
    "if one further increases the @xmath2 value , the spectrum curve in the isw regime will rise up above that of general relativity .",
    "moreover , once we marginalize over all the other cosmological parameters , the turning point @xmath61 will shift to around @xmath63 , and the second peak @xmath62 moves to @xmath64 .",
    "compared with @xmath0 gravity , the chameleon - type model includes the other two free parameters @xmath34 and @xmath10 , which are fixed to @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the former case . due to the amount of extra modified gravity parameters and the degeneracy among them , we find that the _ planck _ constraints on the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath10 are still quite loose , with no obvious improvement when comparing to wmap9yr results .",
    "however , we are able to improve the constraints on @xmath34 : we find @xmath11 at @xmath57c.l . compared with @xmath68 at @xmath57c.l . from wmap9yr .",
    "the detailed global analysis results can be found in tab .",
    "[ tab3 ] and fig .",
    "[ cm_1d ] .",
    "confidence regions in the @xmath34-@xmath1 plane , after marginalizing over the other parameters , are shown in fig .",
    "[ beta1_h0 ] .",
    "one could notice that the value @xmath69 , corresponding to @xmath0 models , is well outside the @xmath18 confidence region .",
    "however this does not rule out @xmath0 model by any means given the very loose constraints on the other two relevant @xmath0 parameters @xmath2 and @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : b1 ] , we compare the likelihood of @xmath34 with(out ) marginalization over @xmath2 by using @xmath65+wp+lensing+bao+hst+union2 data sets .",
    "it clearly shows that the stringent constraint on @xmath34 is due to the marginalization effect on @xmath2 , whose constraint is very loose for the chameleon - type model via current data sets .",
    "and we have alse tested that if we fix @xmath70 and use the same data sets , the marginalized @xmath71 confidence level for @xmath34 is @xmath72 , which reconciles with @xmath0 gravity very well .",
    "we can also see in tab .",

    "<S> we also use wmap9yr data for consistency check and comparison . for @xmath0 gravity </S>",
    "<S> , wmap9yr results can only give quite a loose constraint on the modified gravity parameter @xmath2 , which is related to the present value of the compton wavelength of the extra scalar degree of freedom , @xmath3 at @xmath4 we demonstrate that this constraint mainly comes from the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect . with only _ planck _ </S>",
    "<S> cmb temperature power - spectrum data , we can improve the wmap9yr result by a factor @xmath5 ( @xmath6 at @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the _ planck _ lensing potential power - spectrum data are also taken into account , the constraint can be further strenghtened by a factor @xmath7 ( @xmath8 at @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this major improvement mainly comes from the small - scale lensing signal . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , bao , hst and supernovae data could slightly improve the @xmath2 bound ( @xmath9 at @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the chameleon - type model , we find that the data set which we used can not constrain the compton wavelength @xmath2 and the potential index @xmath10 of chameleon field , but can give a tight constraint on the parameter @xmath11 at @xmath4 ( @xmath12 in general relativity ) , which accounts for the non - minimal coupling between the chameleon field and the matter component . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we find that both modified gravity models we considered favor a relatively higher hubble parameter than the concordance @xmath13cdm model in general relativity . </S>"
