    "this discrepancy has been attributed to the presence of the additional beam hadron remnant in @xmath61 collisions , which leads to secondary interactions .",

    "in contrast , processes in which the photon is first resolved into partons which then engage in the hard scattering resemble hadron - hadron scattering . these resolved photon processes can produce gluon - gluon and gluon - quark final states , which are present in @xmath61 collisions but negligible in dis .",
    "furthermore , they have an additional hadronic remnant which opens up the possibility of remnant - remnant interactions .",
