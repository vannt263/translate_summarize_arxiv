    "recent spectroscopic studies of various hole - doped ( p - type ) and electron - doped ( n - type ) cuprate superconductors have revealed that some phenomena widely perceived as essential for the occurrence of cuprate superconductivity are in fact not universal , and that substantial asymmetries exist between p - type and n - type cuprates.@xcite more specifically , the pairing symmetry in p - type cuprates appears to be predominantly @xmath0 or @xmath1 for all doping levels , both involving four nodes in the momentum ( @xmath2 ) space and @xmath2-dependent superconducting energy gap ( @xmath3).@xcite in contrast , quasiparticle tunneling spectra of infinite - layer and one - layer n - type cuprates studied to date are all @xmath2-independent and are therefore consistent with @xmath4-wave pairing,@xcite although experiments other than tunneling spectra suggest doping dependent pairing symmetry in the one - layer n - type cuprates.@xcite these different pairing symmetries have been attributed to competing energy scales in the cuprates.@xcite the response in the pairing state to quantum impurities that substitute cu in the cuo@xmath5 plane is also asymmetric between p - type and n - type cuprates , the former being sensitive to both magnetic and non - magnetic impurities as expected for @xmath6-wave superconductors,@xcite while the latter being only sensitive to magnetic impurities as expected for typical @xmath4-wave superconductors.@xcite moreover , scanning tunneling and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopic ( sts and arpes ) studies@xcite reveal pseudogap features well above the superconducting transition t@xmath7 in optimal and underdoped @xmath8 ( bi-2212 ) single crystals , and these pseudogap features evolve smoothly below @xmath9into the so - called `` dip - hump '' satellite features at energies above the superconducting gap .",
    "in contrast , no quasiparticle pseudogap has been identified in @xmath10 ( ybco ) above @xmath9,@xcite although satellite features similar to those of bi-2212 also exist at @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , neither spectral satellite features below @xmath9 nor quasiparticle pseudogap above @xmath9 have ever been reported for the n - type cuprates.@xcite the low - energy spin excitations inferred from neutron scattering studies also reveal substantial differences between the p - type and n - type cuprates , the former being associated with gapped spin excitations@xcite while the latter being gapless.@xcite finally , nano - scale spatial variations in the tunneling gap of under- and optimally doped bi-2212@xcite differ from the spatially homogeneous pairing potential in ybco and n - type cuprates according to sts@xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies.@xcite    the aforementioned non - universal phenomena strongly suggest that the asymmetric behaviors between n - type and p - type cuprates can not be easily reconciled with a one - band hubbard model that asserts particle - hole symmetry,@xcite and that better understanding of the pairing mechanism relies on determining the physical origin of these non - universal phenomena and identifying the ubiquitous features among all cuprates . in the following ,",
    "we propose a scenario that provides feasible account for the non - universal pseudogap phenomenon , satellite features and spatial homogeneity of the pairing potential .",
    "the physical implications of and more stringent tests for this scenario are discussed .",
    "the absence of pseudogap in n - type cuprates@xcite implies that the pseudogap phenomenon can not be a prerequisite for cuprate superconductivity .",
    "to better understand the physical origin of the pseudogap , we compare the quasiparticle tunneling spectra in under- and optimally doped bi-2212 with those of ybco and n - type cuprates , as exemplified in figs .",
    "1(a)-(b ) . in the case of bi-2212 ,",
    "a typical c - axis tunneling spectrum with sharp superconducting coherence peaks at @xmath11 is often accompanied by the dip - hump satellite features at higher energies,@xcite and the superconducting coherence peaks diminish with increasing temperature.@xcite the other types of spectra in bi-2212 , which typically occur at locations only a few nanometers away from regions showing the first type of spectra,@xcite reveal rounded peaks and non - vanishing density of states at zero bias , as exemplified in the inset of fig .",
    "1(a ) , and these rounded features generally persist well above @xmath9.@xcite in contrast , only one type of c - axis tunneling spectra with both sharp coherence peaks and satellite features can be observed in ybco,@xcite as shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "1(a ) , and all interesting features completely vanish above @xmath9.@xcite    the phenomena described above may be understood in terms of a `` pseudogap phase '' competing with superconductivity as follows .",
    "theoretical investigations@xcite have shown that two competing orders a and b of a system generally result in three types of phase diagrams as a function of the chemical potential @xmath12 , as illustrated in figs .",
    "2(a)-(c ) .",
    "for the phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "2(a ) , nano - scale phase separations of a and b are expected if the chemical potential coincides with the critical value @xmath13 . noting that the same chemical potential can be associated with different doping levels",
    ", we suggest that the under- and optimally doped bi-2212 may belong to this category . on the other hand , long - range spatial homogeneity of the order parameter is expected for the coexisting phase a / b depicted in fig .",
    "this scenario may correspond to the observed spatial homogeneity of the quasiparticle spectra in the pairing state of ybco , with coexisting superconducting coherence peaks and satellite features .",
    "moreover , it could account for the absence of quasiparticle pseudogap above @xmath9@xcite if the condition @xmath14 is satisfied .    concerning the microscopic makeup of the pseudogap phase",
    ", we note that according to the mermin - wagner theorem,@xcite no long - range order with spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry can exist in a strictly 2d system .",
    "given that superconductivity involves spontaneous u(1 ) symmetry - breaking below @xmath9 , one would expect the absence of long - range superconducting order in highly 2d systems such as bi-2212 .",
    "meanwhile , if a second phase relatively close in energy to superconductivity ( sc ) exists and if it can be stabilized by disorder , phase separations at between the second phase and sc at relatively small spatial scales would become highly probable .",
    "we suggest that the pseudogap phase may be a `` charge nematic '' ( cn ) phase which involves localized stripe - like charge modulations .",
    "the cn phase is energetically more favorable than charge stripes because of its reduced coulomb repulsion relative to the latter .",
    "moreover , cn phase could fulfill the role of accommodating incommensurate hole doping via local spin fluctuations , which is consistent with neutron scattering experiments that attribute the observation of gapped spin excitations to charge modulations in p - type cuprates.@xcite under this premise , the phase boundary between cn and sc would involve defected spin configurations because sc is effectively a spin liquid , and the defected spin configurations in 2d could be either positive or negative in sense , similar to the disclinations or vortex / anti - vortex pairs in 2d .",
    "moreover , these locally defected configurations could be statically pinned by disorder , analogous to the observed quantum hall nematic ( qhn ) phase in 2d electron gas ( 2deg).@xcite on the other hand , introduction of 3d coupling not only stabilizes long - range sc order but also permits smooth relaxation of defected spin configurations , thereby eliminating the need for phase separation .",
    "thus , our conjecture of cn being the pseudogap phase competing with sc can account for the long - range spatial homogeneity of the pairing potential in 3d ybco and the nano - scale phase separations in 2d bi-2212 for @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , gapless spin excitations in n - type cuprates@xcite are unlikely related to local charge modulations .",
    "therefore there is no obvious competing order with sc near the optimal doping of n - type cuprates , which explains the long - range homogeneity of the pairing potential and the absence of pseudogap in zero field.@xcite",
    "in the case of n - type cuprates , while the momentum - independent quasiparticle tunneling spectra and the insensitivity of superconductivity to non - magnetic impurities are strongly supportive of s - wave pairing symmetry,@xcite the quasiparticle spectra differ substantially from the bcs prediction for conventional s - wave superconductors.@xcite as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , we note that there are excess sub - gap quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) , which can not be accounted for by either disorder effects@xcite or anisotropy in the fully gapped fermi surface.@xcite recall that neutron scattering experiments reveal gapless spin excitations in n - type cuprates,@xcite we conjecture that the excess sub - gap quasiparticle dos is the result of quasiparticle coupling to the background gapless spin excitations",
    ". however , theoretically it is not possible to have gapless spin excitations above one dimension without the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry.@xcite in the absence of spontaneous su(2 ) symmetry - breaking in the superconducting state , the only possibility for generating gapless spin excitations in n - type cuprates is to invoke non - trivial coupling of spin fluctuations to the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the resulting phase fluctuations have been shown to yield broadening of the quasiparticle spectra,@xcite which is consistent with our experimental finding.@xcite such coupling can also justify the existence of gapless spin excitations through spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry - breaking in the superconducting state .",
    "however , a rigorous proof from first principle will require deriving an effective perturbation hamiltonian @xmath15 from the coupling of the gapless spin excitations to the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "once @xmath15 is known , one can obtain the green s function @xmath16 of the perturbed system , and the quasiparticle dos @xmath17 can be derived through the imaginary part of @xmath18 via the relation @xmath19 / \\pi$ ] .",
    "this theoretical issue awaits further investigation .",
    "we have proposed in the previous sections that different low - energy spin excitations in p - type and n - type cuprate superconductors are responsible for various non - universal characteristics such as the pseudogap phenomenon and satellite features in the quasiparticle spectra .",
    "we further suggest that a charge nematic ( cn ) phase as a competing order with superconductivity can gives rise to nano - scale spectral variations in highly 2d p - type cuprates while yielding long - range spectral homogeneity in 3d p - type cuprates .",
    "the conjecture of a competing cn phase is feasible for a number of reasons .",
    "first , cn is much closer in energy to sc than other known competing orders such as antiferromagnetism and stripes .",
    "moreover , the association of the cn phase with gapped spin excitations is consistent with the doping dependence of pseudogap in p - type cuprates , because the spin stiffness and therefore the energy required for gapped spin excitations decreases with increasing hole doping .",
    "in addition , cn as a near - by competing order would be consistent with the `` checker - board '' short - range charge modulations observed within the vortex core of bi-2212@xcite upon the suppression of sc inside the vortex core by magnetic fields .",
    "finally , the absence of gapped spin excitations in n - type cuprates implies absence of a competing cn phase , which can be reconciled with the long - range spectral homogeneity in n - type cuprate as well as the absence of pseudogap above @xmath9 and missing satellite features below @xmath9 .    despite the consistencies , a number of issues still await further verifications .",
    "first , rigorous theoretical proof for the stability of a ground state cn phase and its dependence on the doping level and disorder will be necessary .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the cn phase with temperature , the spatial distribution of the cn and sc phase boundaries , and the effect of magnetic fields are issues to be addressed both empirically and theoretically . finally , the microscopic coupling mechanism of the gapless spin excitations in n - type cuprates to phase fluctuations of the order parameter must be resolved .",
    "we have reviewed asymmetric behaviors among p - type and n - type cuprates and discussed possible physical origin for various non - universal phenomena . in the case of p - type cuprates , we propose a charge nematic ( cn ) phase , which is associated with gapped spin excitations , as a competing order to superconductivity ( sc ) .",
    "the competition of cn and sc can result in nano - scale phase separation in 2d while yielding homogeneous order parameter in 3d . on the other hand ,",
    "we suggest that the gapless spin excitations in n - type cuprates may be responsible for the excess sub - gap quasiparticle density of states and the missing satellite features below @xmath9 , as well as the absence of pseudogap above @xmath9 . these considerations of empirical facts suggest that spin correlation plays an essential role in cuprate superconductivity .",
