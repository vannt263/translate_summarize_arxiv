    "first reports about superconducting binary solid solutions of transition elements appeared in early 1960s  @xcite . those alloys with general formula a@xmath7b@xmath8 ( a , b = hf , zr , ti , ta , v , cr , mo , nb , re ) have moderate transition temperatures , which do not exceed 12 k ( mo - re alloy ) .",
    "recently , it has been reported  @xcite that superconductivity also appears in more complex metallic alloys , commonly called _ high entropy alloys _ ( hea ) due to particular role of configuration entropy in their crystal stability  @xcite .",
    "combination of ta , nb , hf , zr and ti with concentrations of 0.34 , 0.33 , 0.08 , 0.14 , and 0.11  @xcite respectively , resulted in discovery of ii - type superconductor with body - centered cubic structure ( a = 3.36   ) .",

    "it is worth noting , that the number of valence electrons per  atom  ( vec ) is slightly below the half filling of the @xmath16-shell , being equal to 4.67 , which is also consistent with the value of 4.7 , for which hulm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed maximum transition temperature of the binary superconducting solid solutions @xmath17 ( second maximum was observed near 6.4 ) .",
    "this new class of alloys ( hea )  @xcite are frequently called a  metallic glass on an ordered crystal lattice   @xcite since , in spite of a relatively large number of elements ( from five to more than twenty ) with concentrations ranging from 5 to 35% , hea crystallize in surprisingly simple structures . instead of complex ordered intermetallic phases , random @xmath18 or @xmath19 structures",
    "are formed , and recently @xmath20 hea has been reported  @xcite .    the aim of this work is to calculate the electronic structure of the superconducting tnhzt system and to estimate the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "such calculation should allow verifying whether the superconductivity of the system can be explained using the conventional mechanism as suggested from experimental data  @xcite .",
    "a high degree of chemical disorder occuring in hea , i.e. five or more atoms randomly occupying the same crystallographic site , complicate the calculations of the electronic structure and resuling physical properties of these materials .",
    "fortunately , the korringa - kohn - rostoker method combined with the coherent potential approximation ( kkr - cpa )  @xcite appears to be well adapted technique to treat such complex cases , since it allows to perform first principles computations of chemically disordered materials in a self - consistent way .",

    "thus finally , the following formula will be used for calculating the epc constant @xmath6 in the studied alloy : @xmath49",
    "total electronic density of states is presented in fig .  [",

    "the values of dos at @xmath22 are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the highest contribution to the total dos comes from ta and nb atoms , due to their highest atomic concentrations in the alloy .",
    "the shape of ta and nb dos are similar to each other , just as the shape of hf and zr doses .",
    "the only @xmath50 element , ti , has the most pronounced dos peak near @xmath22 and then exhibits the highest atomic @xmath51 .",

    "the bandwidth is marked in green and corresponds to the imaginary part of the energy . ]",
    "[ fig : bnd ] shows the electronic bands .",
    "note , that in the disordered system the generalization of the usual dispersion @xmath52 relations is needed in order to take into account the  alloy  scattering of electrons . to describe @xmath52 in an alloy",
    ", one can use the bloch spectral functions  @xcite , which are especially useful when strong ( resonant ) electron scattering takes place and well - defined bands do not exist  @xcite .",
    "if the scattering is not very strong and primarily leads to the band smearing , the complex energy band technique  @xcite may be used .",
    "the real part of such a complex energy eigenvalue shows the center of the band , whereas the imaginary part describes the band width , which corresponds to the finite life time of the electronic state @xmath53 . in the studied case of the high entropy alloy , in spite of the large disorder between five elements on a single crystal site",
    ", electronic bands appeared to be quite sharp ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bnd ] ) .",
    "especially near @xmath22 , the bandwidth is really small , resulting in @xmath54  s. such values are of the same order as in typical transition - metal alloys and explain why the residual resistivity of tnhzt alloy ( @xmath55 cm ) is not much larger than ( or close to ) the @xmath56 values of binary alloys near 50 - 50 atomic concentrations ( e.g. 25 in ti - hf , 45 in ti - zr , 12 in zr - hf , 10 in nb - ta  @xcite and 45 in nb - zr  @xcite , [ all values in @xmath57 cm ] ) , and even smaller than in some ternary alloys ( e.g. ti - zr - nb alloys exhibit @xmath58 cm depending on the composition  @xcite ) .",
    "noteworthy , the total @xmath59 ry@xmath25 = 1.76  ev@xmath25 corresponds to the  bare  value of the sommerfeld electronic specific heat coefficienf @xmath60 = 4.2  ( mj mol@xmath25k@xmath61 ) , which , matched to the experimental value of @xmath62 = 8.3 @xmath63 0.1  ( mj mol@xmath25k@xmath61 ) , yields the epc parameter @xmath6 = @xmath64 - 1 = 0.98 @xmath63 0.01 @xmath65 1.0 , suggesting relatively strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] also shows the computed mh parameters . despite quite low dos at @xmath22 , zr atoms have the largest mh parameter .",
    "hovewer , more important when calculating electron - phonon coupling strength are @xmath26 of atoms with highest concentrations i.e. tantalum and niobum . for theses",
    "two elements , the most important scattering channel is @xmath16-@xmath66 , typically for transition elements . in zirconium and hafnium , @xmath67-@xmath16 and @xmath16-@xmath66 scattering channels are equally relevant .",
    "interesting observation can be made , if the values of atomic @xmath68 are compared to their values computed in elemental crystals , shown in table  [ tab2 ] ( values for @xmath20 metals with two atoms per primitive cell are doubled ) .",
    "ta and nb , having the same @xmath18 crystal structure as the tnhzt alloy , have similar values of @xmath68 , whereas for hf , zr and ti in the hea alloy they are 2.5 - 3-times larger .",
    "this feature results from both , change of the unit cell geometry ( strongly changing dos shape ) and the shift of the fermi level position due to the change in vec , which locates @xmath22 in the local peak of dos .",
    "the sole change of the crystal structure from @xmath20 to @xmath18 , with @xmath69 = 3.36   , roughly doubles their @xmath68 .",
    "now , taking the experimental value of @xmath70 k of the alloy  @xcite , average atomic mass of @xmath71 a.u . and mh parameters @xmath68 from table  [ tab1 ] , one arrives at the epc parameter @xmath72 .",
    "this result is in a good agreement with the value estimated above using the sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath5 may be now calculated using the mcmillan formula  @xcite @xmath74.\\ ] ] taking the standard value of the coulomb pseudopential , @xmath75 = 0.13 , calculated critical temperature is @xmath5 = 15 k , when @xmath76 is used , two times higher than the experimental @xmath9  k. fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] shows @xmath5 plotted as a function of @xmath75 , with shading area corresponding to the uncertainty in @xmath70  k , used for both @xmath6 and @xmath5 computation . as can be seen , the value of @xmath75 as large as 0.25 has to be used to obtain @xmath5 consistent with experimental data .",
    "this discrepancy may be caused by the rough estimation of the phonon part of the epc constant .",
    "slightly smaller difference between theory and experiment is observed , if @xmath6 = 1.0 , obtained from the analysis of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath77 , is used ( @xmath5 = 11.5  k ) , however it also requires applying rather large @xmath75 = 0.20 to reach the experimental @xmath5 ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] ) .",
    "it is worth reminding here that similar problems with large @xmath75 needed to reproduce experimental @xmath5 were reported in literature for various materials , like nb@xmath78ge ( @xmath75=0.24 )  @xcite , v ( @xmath75=0.3 )  @xcite or mgcni@xmath78 ( @xmath75=0.29 )  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , presented kkr - cpa calculations , within rmta approach , support the electron - phonon coupling mechanism of the superconductivity in the tnhzt hea , and show relatively strong electron - phonon interaction , with @xmath79 .",
    "finally , to investigate how the superconductivity in the studied system is sensitive to moderate changes in composition , we have calculated variations in mh parameters when vec is modified from 4.67 , in the range 4.6 - 4.75 , by changing the relative amount of group-4 ( ti , zr , hf ) and group-5 ( nb , ta ) elements , and keeping unchanged the ratio between elements in each group . assuming , that the ifcs does not change ( i.e. assuming @xmath80 = const . ) the change in @xmath6 was simulated and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : x](b ) .",
    "first of all , @xmath6 is not very sensitive to changes in composition in this range , but what is quite intriguing , it is maximized for this particular ratio of group-4 and group-5 elements , investigated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "kkr - cpa electronic structure calculations of the superconducting high entropy alloy ta@xmath0nb@xmath1hf@xmath2zr@xmath3ti@xmath4 accounting for chemical disorder as random distribution of constituent atoms in @xmath18 unit cell , are reported .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath6 = 1.16 was calculated , using the computed mcmillan - hopfield parameters and experimental debye temperature .",
    "the obtained @xmath6 well corroborates with the value of @xmath81 1.0 extracted from the experimental electronic specific heat and calculated electronic dos at @xmath22 . in view of our results",
