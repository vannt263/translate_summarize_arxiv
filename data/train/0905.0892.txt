    "photometric redshifts ( connolly _ et al . _  1995 ,",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 , benitez 2000 ) are a key component of galaxy surveys .",
    "as surveys get larger , reducing statistical uncertainties , systematic errors become more important .",
    "systematic errors in photometric redshifts are therefore a top concern for future large galaxy surveys , for example as highlighted by the dark energy task force ( albrecht _ et al . _  2006 ) .",
    "much of the concern has centered on `` catastrophic outliers '' which are galaxies for which the photometric redshift is very wrong , for example when mistaking the lyman break at @xmath1 for the 4000  break at very low redshift .",
    "even a small fraction of outliers can significantly impact the downstream science , and modeling this impact requires going beyond simple gaussian models of photometric redshift errors .",
    "in many cases , however , outliers are `` catastrophic '' only because they have a multimodal redshift probability @xmath0 , which can not be accurately represented by a single number such as the most probable redshift .",
    "fernandez - soto _",
    "et al . _  ( 2002 ) showed that after defining confidence intervals around the @xmath0 peaks , 95% of galaxies in their sample had spectroscopic redshifts within the 95% confidence interval and 99% had spectroscopic redshifts within the 99% confidence interval .",
    "yet the same data appear to contain catastrophic outliers on a plot where each galaxy is represented only by a point with symmetric errorbars .",
    "there is a second motivation for using the full @xmath0 .",
    "the redshift ambiguities described above are due to color - space degeneracies .",
    "but even without these degeneracies , photometric redshift errors should be asymmetric about the most probable redshift due to the nonlinear mapping of redshift into color space .",
    "avoiding biases from this effect also requires reference to @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , mandelbaum _",
    "et al . _  ( 2008 ) showed that using @xmath0 in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( which are not deep enough to suffer serious degeneracies ) substantially reduced systematic calibration errors for galaxy - galaxy weak lensing .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate , using simple simulations , the reduction in systematic error that can result from using the full @xmath0 in a deep survey with significant degeneracies .",
    "we also introduce a simple way to reduce the computational cost of doing so .",
    "we conducted simulations similar to those in margoniner & wittman ( 2008 ) and wittman _ et al . _  ( 2007 ) , which used the bayesian photometric redshift ( bpz , benitez 2000 ) code , including its set of six template galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and its set of priors on the joint magnitude - sed type - redshift distribution .",
    "we started with an actual r band catalog from the deep lens survey ( dls , wittman _",
    "et al . _",
    "2002 ) . for each galaxy , we used the @xmath2 magnitude to generate a mock type and redshift according to the priors , and then generated synthetic colors in the bvrz@xmath3 filter set used by dls .",
    "( the filter set is not central to the argument here , but one must be used for concreteness . ) we then added photometry noise and zero - point errors representative of the dls .",
    "the color distributions in the resulting mock catalog were similar to those of the actual catalog , indicating that the mock catalog is consistent with a real galaxy survey .",
    "we then ran the mock catalog of 83,000 galaxies through bpz , saving the full @xmath0 . in a post - processing stage",
    ", we can extract from the full @xmath0 not only the most probable redshift ( which had already been determined by bpz and labeled @xmath4 ) , but other candidate one - point estimates such as the mean and median of @xmath0 , as well as the summed @xmath0 for any desired set of galaxies .",
    "we first show one of the traditional one - point estimates to more clearly illustrate the problem .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig - zmc ] shows the most probable redshift @xmath4 vs. true redshift @xmath5 . to accurately render both the high- and low - density parts of this plot ,",
    "we show it as a colormap rather than a scatterplot .",
    "the core is rather tight , requiring a logarithmic mapping between color and density to bring out the more subtle features in the wings . with this mapping ,",
    "the systematics are clear : a tendency to put galaxies truly at @xmath6 at very low redshift ; a tendency to put galaxies truly at low redshift at @xmath7 ; and asymmetric horizontal smearing in several different @xmath4 intervals , e.g. at @xmath8 .",
    "the specifics of the features depend on the filter set , but their general appearance is typical ( but note that they will be difficult to see in plots based on spectroscopic followup of deep imaging surveys , as the brighter , spectroscopically accessible , galaxies form a much tighter relation ) .",
    "corresponding plots are not shown for other one - point estimates such as the mean and median of @xmath0 , but they have similar to worse systematic deviations .    which systematics are most important depends on the application .",
    "in this paper we consider two - point correlations of weak gravitational lensing ( cosmic shear ) , which require that the photometric redshift _ distribution _ of a sample of galaxies be as close as possible to the true redshift distribution ; errors on specific galaxies are not important .",
    "also , accurate knowledge of the scatter is much more important than minimizing the amount of scatter .",
    "thus , figure  [ fig - zmc ] would ideally be symmetric about a line of unity slope , reflecting the fact that the photometric and true redshift distributions are identical .. ] this is clearly not the case for the top panel of figure  [ fig - zmc ] .",
    "ideally @xmath0 contains the required information lacking in the single number @xmath4 , but it is also more difficult to work with , requiring the storage and manipulation of an array of numbers for each galaxy .",
    "we simplify the computational bookkeeping by defining a single number which is by construction representative of the full @xmath0 .",
    "this estimate is simply a random number distributed according to the probability distribution @xmath0 and is denoted by @xmath9 because it is a monte carlo sample of the full @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , for each galaxy , a random number @xmath10 is drawn uniformly from the interval @xmath11 , and the monte carlo redshift @xmath9 is defined such that @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig - mcprocess ] illustrates the process .",
    "the bottom panel shows @xmath0 as usually plotted , while the top panel shows the cumulative @xmath0 , that is , the probability that the galaxy lies at redshift less than the value on the abscissa .",
    "a random number in the range 0 - 1 is drawn , in this case 0.32 , and the redshift at which the cumulative @xmath0 has a value of 0.32 ( dotted line ) is recorded as @xmath9 , in this case 0.47 .",
    "this results in a single number for each galaxy , which remains unbiased even if @xmath0 is multimodal and/or asymmetric .",
    "of course , some precision is lost in this process ; it should be avoided when studying a small number of galaxies in great detail , but for large samples of galaxies it must converge to the @xmath0 of the sample .",
    "furthermore , it requires only a minor modification to most photometric redshift codes .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig - zmc ] shows @xmath9 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , the systematics are vastly improved . even with the logarithmic scaling , it is difficult to see departures from symmetry about a line of unity slope .",
    "we therefore compare one - dimensional histograms in what follows . a typical use of photometric redshifts in a galaxy survey will be to bin the galaxies by redshift , for example to compute shear correlations in redshift shells .",
    "because the true redshifts will not be known , the galaxies must be binned by some photometric redshift criterion . for simplicity , we choose @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig - sumpz ] ( upper panel ) shows true and inferred redshift distributions of galaxies in four @xmath4 bins : 0 - 0.1 , 0.4 - 0.5 , 0.9 - 1.1 , and 1.4 - 1.6 .",
    "the true distributions is shown in black , the distribution inferred from @xmath9 is shown in red , and the distribution inferred from summing the galaxies @xmath0 is shown in blue . the asymmetry and the wings of the true redshift distribution",
    "are well captured by @xmath9 or by summing @xmath0 . by comparison , using each galaxy s most probable redshift @xmath4 to infer the redshift distributions would have resulted in four vertical - sided bins , which would become roughly gaussian after convolving with the typical galaxy s @xmath4 uncertainty .",
    "it is clear that this would not capture the true redshift distribution nearly as well as the @xmath0 method does .",
    "for example , the inset in figure  [ fig - sumpz ] shows a small high - redshift ( @xmath13 ) bump in the 0.4 - 0.5 bin which is captured by @xmath9 or by summing @xmath0 .",
    "looking only at the most probable redshift @xmath4 would result in these galaxies being considered catastrophic outliers .    another way to reduce `` catastrophic outliers '' and",
    "related systematics might be to discard galaxies whose @xmath0 is multimodal , not sharply peaked , or otherwise fails some test .",
    "this may be effective , but it greatly reduces the number of galaxies available to work with . the @xmath9 and full @xmath0 methods accurately reflect the true redshift distributions without requiring any reduction in galaxy sample size .",
    "this is important for applications such as lensing , for which galaxy shot noise will always be an issue .",
    "having demonstrated that using @xmath0 ( whether by sampling or by using the full distribution ) greatly reduces photometric redshift systematics , two questions naturally arise .",
    "how much better is it in terms of a science - based metric ? and what are the remaining errors or limitations ?",
    "because @xmath9 and the full @xmath0 give very similar results , references to using @xmath0 in the remainder of the paper should be understood to include either implementation .",
    "for each of the four @xmath4 bins shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sumpz ] , we compute the redshift bias ( inferred minus true mean redshift ) for the full @xmath0 and @xmath4 approaches .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - zbias ] as the solid and dotted lines respectively ( the results for @xmath9 are nearly indistinguishable from those for the full @xmath0 and are not shown ) . for the dls filter set and noise model ,",
    "the bias is within a few hundredths of a unit redshift when using @xmath0 , but only within several tenths when using the most probable redshift @xmath4 . for lensing applications ,",
    "the @xmath4 bias at low redshift is exaggerated somewhat , because it results from a small outlying bump at high redshift , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - sumpz ] . in a real survey",
    ", these high - redshift interlopers would be smaller and fainter than the galaxies that really belong in the low - redshift bin , and therefore have less precise shape measurements and smaller weight on the shear statistics .",
    "we account for this effect by assigning a lensing weight to each mock galaxy based on its magnitude and drawn from the actual distribution of weights as a function of magnitude in the dls .",
    "this reduces the bias of the lowest - redshift bin to 0.02 for @xmath0 and 0.24 for @xmath4 , and has a progressively smaller effect on higher - redshift bins .",
    "fig . 7 of ma _ et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) shows the degradation in dark energy parameters for a wide and very deep weak lensing survey , as a function of the tightness of priors that can be put on the redshift bias and scatter in photometric redshift bins .",
    "it shows that loose priors of order 0.2 result in 80 - 85% degradation in @xmath14 estimates ( with respect to a survey with absolutely no redshift errors ) . if , on the other hand , one need only allow for a @xmath15 bias as with the @xmath0 approach , the degradation decreases to 50 - 60% . for estimating @xmath16 , the degradation decreases from a factor of six to a factor of about 2.5 by employing @xmath0 .",
    "these are only rough estimates , for a number of reasons .",
    "future surveys as deep as those contemplated by ma _",
    "et al . _  ( 2006 ) will use more extensive filter sets , which will probably improve the @xmath4 performance somewhat with respect to the @xmath0 performance . and nearer - term ,",
    "shallower surveys have looser redshift requirements because their shear measurements are not as precise .",
    "but it is clear that using @xmath0 greatly improves the survey at essentially no cost .",
    "we also conducted simulations using a more extensive filter set , to check the generality",
    "the simulations are simplistic in that the same six sed templates ( and priors ) used to infer @xmath0 are used to generate the mock catalogs . in real photometric redshift catalogs , @xmath0 will be less perfect because galaxy seds are more varied and priors are imperfectly known .",
    "smaller effects of the same nature include uncertainties in real - life filter and throughput curves , which are artificially reduced to zero here",
    ". however , these errors also affect the most probable redshift . therefore , although the simulated results presented here are optimistic overall ( given this filter set ) , the performance of @xmath0 _ relative _ to using the most probable redshift may not be .",
    "more sophisticated simulations beyond the scope of this paper will be required to determine the limits of @xmath0 accuracy for any given filter set and survey depth .",
    "the remaining redshift bias is not trivial , 0.01 - 0.02 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than required to keep the @xmath14 degradation within 10% of an ideal survey ( for the deepest surveys ; requirements are less stringent for shallower surveys ) .",
    "however , a few factors are actually pessimistic here compared to future large surveys : the limited filter set , and relatively large zeropoint errors ( @xmath17 mag here vs 0.01 mag for sdss and future large surveys )",
    ". a more extensive filter set will improve _ both _ the @xmath0 and the @xmath4 etimates , but will probably improve the @xmath4 estimate more as it eliminates some degeneracies .",
    "again , survey - specific simulations will be required to make more specific conclusions .",
    "finally , there is a source of bias not simulated here : eddington ( 1913 ) bias .",
    "the type and redshift priors are based on magnitude , but at the faint end magnitudes are biased due to the asymmetry between the large number of faint galaxies that noise can scatter to brighter magnitudes , versus the smaller number of moderately bright galaxies that noise can scatter to fainter magnitudes .",
    "surveys wishing to derive photometric redshifts for galaxies detected at , say , 10@xmath18 or fainter , must use the hogg & turner ( 1998 ) prescription for removing eddington bias from each galaxy s flux measurements if they are to avoid nontrivial systematic errors .",
    "we have shown that using the photometric redshift probability distribution @xmath0 greatly reduces photometric redshift systematic errors , as compared to using a simple one - point estimate such as the most probable redshift or the mean or median of @xmath0 .",
    "various authors have made similar points previously , particularly fernandez - soto _",
    "et al . _  ( 2002 ) , who wrote that `` this information [ p(z ) ] can and must be used in the calculation of any observable quantity that makes use of the redshift . ''",
    "however , adoption of this practice has been slow to nonexistent , even among authors who are aware of the point , because it is cumbersome to track a full @xmath0 for each galaxy .",
    "we have shown that a very simple modification to photometric redshift codes , namely choosing a monte carlo sample from the @xmath0 , produces a single number for each galaxy which greatly reduces the systematic errors compared to using any other one - point estimate such as the mean , median , or mode of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to approaches which simply reject galaxies which _ could _ be outliers , this method can make use of every galaxy in a survey .",
    "we have shown that this method results in substantial improvements in a flagship application , estimating dark energy parameters from weak lensing , at no cost to the survey ."
