    "the rise of deep large area surveys such as 2mass ( the two micron all sky survey ) , sdss ( the sloan digital sky survey ) and ukidss ( the uk infrared deep sky survey ) has increased the number of known brown dwarfs to several hundred , since the discovery of gliese 229b @xcite and tiede 1 @xcite just over a decade ago .",
    "these populations have helped shape our understanding of ultracool dwarfs ( ucds ; with spectral type @xmath15m7 e.g. @xcite ) and revolutionized the classification system for sub - stellar objects including the creation of two new spectral types l and t. the latest m dwarfs ( @xmath16m7 - 9 ) have effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) reaching down to @xmath162300k . at lower @xmath3 ( @xmath162300 - 1400k )",
    "are the l dwarfs , which have very dusty upper atmospheres and generally very red colours .",
    "t dwarfs are even cooler having @xmath3 in the range @xmath161400 - 650k , where the low @xmath3 limit is currently defined by the recently discovered t8@xmath17 dwarfs , ulas j0034 - 0052 @xcite and cfbds j005910.90 - 011401.3 @xcite .",
    "t dwarf spectra are dominated by strong water vapour and methane bands , and generally appear very blue in the near infrared ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the physics of ultracool atmospheres is complex , and very difficult to accurately model .",
    "atmospheric dust formation is particularly challenging for theory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and there are a variety of other important issues that are not well understood , including the completeness of ch@xmath18/h@xmath19o molecular opacities , their dependence on @xmath3 , gravity and metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as the possible presence of vertical mixing in such atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the emergent spectra from ultracool atmospheres are strongly affected by factors such as gravity and metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and we must improve our understanding of such effects if we are to be able to spectroscopically constrain atmospheric and physical properties ( such as mass , age and composition ) of low - mass / sub - stellar field populations .",
    "discovering ucds whose properties can be inferred indirectly ( without the need for atmospheric models ) is an excellent way to provide a test - bed for theory , and observationally pin down how physical properties affect spectra .",
    "we refer to such ucds as _ benchmark _ objects ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". a population of benchmark ucds with a broad range of atmospheric properties will be invaluable in the task of determining the full extent of spectral sensitivity to variations in ucd physical properties .",
    "however , such benchmarks are not common , and the constraints on their properties are not always particularly strong .",
    "one variety of benchmark ucd that could yield accurate ages and surface gravities over a broad age range are in binary systems with a white dwarf ( wd ) companion .",
    "in particular , if the wd is relatively high mass , then the main sequence progenitor star will have a short lifetime , and the age of the binary system ( and the ucd ) will essentially be the same as the cooling age of the wd , which can be well determined from theory .",
    "there have been several searches to find ucd companions to wds . despite this , only a small number of detached ucd ",
    "wd binaries have been identified ; gd 165b(l4 ) @xcite , gd 1400(l6/7 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , wd@xmath20(l8 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and pg1234 + 482 ( l0 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the two components in gd165 are separated by 120au , the separation of the components in gd1400 and pg@xmath21 are currently unknown and wd@xmath20 is a close binary ( semi - major axis @xmath22r@xmath23 ) . @xcite and @xcite also identified three late m companions to white dwarfs ; wd@xmath24 ( m8 at 23au ) , wd@xmath25 ( m8 at 2054au ) and wd@xmath26 ( m9 at 284au ) . the widest system previously known was an m8.5 dwarf in a triple system  a wide companion to the m4/wd binary lhs 4039 and lhs 4040 @xcite , with a separation of 2200au .",
    "there are several other known ucd ",
    "wd binaries , however these are cataclysmic variables ( e.g. sdss 1035 ; @xcite , sdss1212 ; @xcite , @xcite , ef eri ; @xcite ) but these are unlikely to provide the type of information that will be useful as benchmarks , as they have either evolved to low masses via mass transfer or their ages can not be determined because of previous evolutionary phases ( e.g. common envelope ) .",
    "wd0137 - 349 is also not likely to be useful as a benchmark due to the large uncertainty in age caused by the common envelope stage and the heating from the white dwarf .",
    "recent analysis from @xcite shows that the fraction of brown dwarf companions ( l and t ) at separations within a few hundred au of white dwarfs is @xmath270.6 per cent .",
    "however , despite this ucds in wide binary systems are not uncommon ( revealed through common proper motion ) around main sequence stars at separations of @xmath28au ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,",
    "when a star sheds its envelope post - main sequence , we may expect a ucd companion to migrate outwards to even wider separation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and ucd  wd binaries could thus have separations up to a few tens of thousands of au . although some of the widest binaries may be dynamically broken apart quite rapidly by gravitational interactions with neighbouring stars , some systems may survive , offering a significant repository of benchmark ucds .",
    "we present here the first results from our search of 2mass and the digitized schmidt plate archive supercosmos , for wide ucd ",
    "wd binaries in the southern sky , and present our first discovery of a wide ucd  wd binary confirmed through common proper motion and spectroscopy . in section 2",
    "we describe the techniques we have developed to select candidate ucd ",
    "wd binary systems using database photometry and proper motion .",
    "section 3 describes our second epoch imaging of candidates , and followup infrared and optical spectroscopy along with proper motion analysis .",
    "we present spectroscopic analysis in section 4 .",
    "section 5 discusses the newly discovered system , and section 6 presents a discussion of future work .",
    "candidate wds were selected from the supercosmos science archive ( ssa ) , following a similar technique to that of @xcite .",
    "we selected candidates based on their position on a reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram , a technique that uses proper motion as a distance proxy , taking advantage of the fact that nearby objects in general have higher proper motion .",
    "[ rpmd ] shows our supercosmos rpm diagram .",
    "our initial ssa sample ( shown as dots ) was a magnitude selected sample ( @xmath2920 ) to avoid sources near the plate limit .",
    "we also selected against non - moving sources ( by requiring pm@xmath1510mas yr@xmath30 , pm/@xmath315 ) , and against non stellar sources ( requiring a database star - like class=2 ) .",
    "in addition we avoid the galactic plane ( requiring @xmath3225@xmath33 ) , require ssa @xmath34- band coverage ( @xmath35 + 3@xmath33 ; which offers possible additional epochs for nearby ucd candidates ; see section 3.3 ) , and impose a quality constraint on the database photometry ( qual@xmath361040 in each of the @xmath37- , @xmath38- and @xmath34- bands , indicating the the object is unlikely to be a bright star artifact . ) .    the main sequence and wd sequence can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ rpmd ] , and display good separation for @xmath391.3 . to further illustrate the location of the wd sequence , we over plot the positions of wds from the spectroscopically confirmed mccook & sion wd catalogue ( @xcite ; here after ms99 ) , along with pre - wds ( i.e. sdo stars ) and halo objects from @xcite . we also overplot subdwarf b stars , hot , cool and extreme subdwarfs from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "these , like halo objects can have high velocity dispersions and can masquerade as white dwarfs in rpm diagrams .",
    "the overplotted populations help confirm the location of the wd sequence for @xmath391.3 , and allow us to assess the location of wds out to redder colour .",
    "our final rpm selection criteria were chosen to strike the best balance between wd selection and contamination minimisation , and are shown in fig .",
    "[ rpmd ] as dashed lines . at the red end in particular ,",
    "we have attempted to include as many wd candidates as possible , while avoiding contamination from cool subdwarfs .",
    "the rpm selection criteria are    @xmath40 for @xmath41 and + @xmath42 for @xmath43 ;    our selection criteria resulted in a sample of 1532 wd candidates .",
    "ucd candidates were photometrically selected by their near infrared ( nir ) colours from the 2mass all sky point source catalogue , using the nasa / ipac gator search engine .",
    "we used colour cut criteria devised by @xcite , which are based on the colours of known l - dwarfs with reliable @xmath44- , @xmath45- and @xmath46- band 2mass photometry ( snr@xmath1520 ) from the caltech cool dwarf archive ( dwarfarchives.org ) , requiring the following photometric criteria to be met :    @xmath47 + @xmath48 + @xmath49 + @xmath50 + @xmath51 + and @xmath52 .",
    "+    we also imposed an optical - nir colour restriction using the usno - a2.0 cross - match facility within the gator , ruling out objects with @xmath535.5 ( @xmath54 combined with vr_m_opt-@xmath555.5 , or nopt_mchs=0 ) .",
    "in addition certain sky coverage constraints were imposed , and we made use of the 2mass data quality criteria and some additional database flags , to remove contamination from artefacts and low quality photometric data ( requiring cc_flag=000 , ph_qual@xmath36ccc , jhk_snr@xmath145 , gal_contam=0 , prox@xmath146 ) and known contaminants ( mp_flg=0 ) .",
    "as with the wd candidate selection , we searched areas away from the galactic plane ( @xmath5625@xmath33 ) to avoid confusion from over crowding and contamination from reddened stars and giants .",
    "we also avoided @xmath5786@xmath33 , for which 2mass suffers from incompleteness issues with its optical cross - matching .",
    "additional areas surrounding the small and large magellanic clouds were also ignored .",
    "finally two additional uncatalogued , reddened regions were avoided following the approach of @xcite .",
    "these excluded regions are listed in table  [ cloud_table ] , and the resultant sky coverage of our survey is 13,216 sq .",
    "degs , or 32 per cent of the sky .",
    "visual inspection of all these candidates ( 13,338 in number ) was neither practical or necessary at this stage , and we thus postponed our visual inspection until after our binary pair selection procedure ( see next section ) .",
    ".galactic co - ordinates of contaminated and overcrowded regions removed from our selection .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ properties ]",
    "a parallax measured distance would allow the luminosity of 2massj@xmath9 to be directly measured .",
    "our age constraint would then facilitate a tight model constraint on the radius , and thus an accurate determination of @xmath3 and log(@xmath5 ) .",
    "this ucd could then have a very useful role as part of a testbed for our understanding of ultracool atmospheres .",
    "for example , @xcite studied a set of m dwarfs with young and intermediate ages , and showed that a variety of spectral lines including the @xmath44- band ki lines , are gravity sensitive .",
    "it is also clear that the effects of dust in very late m dwarf atmospheres are not well understood ( e.g. @xcite ) . removing degeneracies in the physical properties of such objects",
    "will allow for a more focused testing of available models in this region of @xmath58log(@xmath5 ) space .",
    "a more expansive search for benchmark ucd - wd binary systems can be made using the combination of ukidss and sdss ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys probe a significantly larger volume for ucds and wds than 2mass and supercosmos , and will thus yield a larger number of wide benchmark binaries , with a broader range of properties .",
    "it is likely that significant numbers of binary systems could be identified containing an l / t dwarf and a wd ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , if the frequency of wide ucd companions to higher mass stars is of a similar level to those found around solar type stars , there could be numerous detectable systems with high mass wd components .",
    "tight constraints on binary age will be particularly important when determining the properties of cooler , lower mass ucd companions , since sub - stellar brown dwarfs cool continuously , and their mass and surface gravity depend strongly on age .",
    "the broad band spectral morphology of l and t dwarf populations show a significant scatter independent of spectral type , presumably due to variations in surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "thus , the physical constraints offered by benchmark systems of this type could hold great potential to reveal trends linking such spectral changes to variations in ucd physical properties .",
