    "the backward inelastic electron scattering has established itself in the last 30 years as one of the main tools for the experimental study of nuclear magnetic excitations .",
    "the attention was focused in the past mainly on spherical nuclei , as it can be seen , e.g. , from the review articles @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of low - lying magnetic dipole ( m1 ) excitations in heavy deformed nuclei started with @xmath0 experiments at the linear accelerator in darmstadt @xcite , reviewed recently in @xcite .",
    "most of the data were collected at a backward scattering angle @xmath13 , where one expects a strong damping of electric excitations .",
    "this can be understood from qualitative considerations @xcite in the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) .",
    "the @xmath0 cross section can be decomposed in this case into longitudinal ( coulomb ) and transverse ( electric and magnetic ) terms , multiplied by corresponding kinematic factors .",
    "the longitudinal kinematic factor @xmath14 vanishes for @xmath15 and only transverse multipoles are excited in backward scattering @xcite . among those with the same multipolarity , the magnetic excitation is dominant over the electric transverse one @xcite .",
    "this qualitative estimate is obtained in the long - wave limit @xmath16 , or small momentum transfer @xmath11 in comparison with the radius @xmath17 of the target nucleus .",
    "magnetic dominance was found at backward angle also in @xcite by assuming a purely spin - flip transition .",
    "the more realistic distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite leads to important corrections especially in heavy nuclei with a strong coulomb field ( a large charge number @xmath18 ) . but this approach is not suitable for simple qualitative predictions , since the longitudinal and transverse electric contributions to the @xmath0 cross section interfere with each other in dwba .",
    "moreover , their separation would be meaningless when the longitudinal and transverse electric contributions are related in the dwba formalism @xcite through the continuity equation .",
    "in contrast to the above discussed common expectations based on the pwba , we have found recently @xcite e2 contributions to the cross sections of low - lying orbital m1 excitations measured at @xmath13 .",
    "such admixtures take place in heavy deformed nuclei where the m1 transition with @xmath19 is accompanied by a closely lying e2 transition with @xmath20 to the first member of the rotational band built on the intrinsic @xmath1 excitation .",
    "the large moment of inertia of these nuclei leads to a small separation between the two excitation energies , comparable with the energy resolution of the @xmath0 experiments .",
    "the accompanying e2 transition provides an important contribution to the measured cross sections ( @xmath13 ) for an effective momentum transfer @xmath21 @xmath9 corresponding to incident electron energies in the range @xmath22 mev @xcite .",
    "the m1 excitations in spherical nuclei are mainly of spin - flip type , which is expected to be favoured in backward electron scattering @xcite . in contrast",
    ", we are considering here a qualitatively different type of predominantly orbital m1 excitations .",
    "they appear only in deformed nuclei @xcite and their experimental study through backward @xmath0 scattering started much later @xcite .",
    "we are going to examine here in more detail some of the well - known qualitative pwba predictions for the interplay of magnetic and electric excitations , paying attention also to the approximations involved .",
    "these predictions ignore the nuclear dynamics because they are made for the general case of unknown transition densities .",
    "the latter could exhibit however some important peculiarities , typical for the considered nuclear excitations .",
    "the qualitative pwba estimates will be compared here to dwba and pwba cross sections obtained from realistic rpa transition densities in order to understand to what extent one could use the general pwba predictions for qualitative interpretation of realistic microscopic results .",
    "we shall study to this purpose the dependence of our theoretical dwba @xmath0 cross sections on the electron incident energy and momentum transfer in the whole possible range of scattering angles @xmath23 .",
    "cross sections of 1@xmath12 excitations in deformed nuclei have been presented and discussed until now almost exclusively for @xmath13 in order to compare them with the corresponding experimental data measured at this angle .",
    "only the cross section of the strongest ( low - lying orbital ) m1 excitation is known experimentally in each one of the several heavy deformed nuclei studied until now .",
    "we choose here @xmath2gd as an example , because this is the only nucleus , where the accompanying e2 transition was identified experimentally @xcite .    we shall present and discuss in the next section the dependence of e2 and m1 cross sections of this typical 1@xmath12 excitation on the incident electron energy and momentum transfer in the whole range of scattering angles .",
    "the results are analyzed qualitatively in pwba for small and large momentum transfer in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "5 and expressions for e2 transition densities are given in the appendix .",
    "we describe intrinsic excitations with @xmath25 in deformed nuclei within the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa , or shorter rpa ) using a model hamiltonian specified in @xcite .",
    "it contains a quasiparticle ( q.p . ) mean field , given by a deformed woods - saxon potential plus pairing .",
    "the separable residual interaction consists of a spin - spin force and a quadrupole - type interaction , derived self - consistently from the deformation of the mean field .",
    "the isoscalar coupling constant of the latter interaction , determined microscopically , ensures the rotational invariance of the model hamiltonian , which is violated by the mean field alone .",
    "the choice of the parameters of the model hamiltonian is explained in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in contrast to many other microscopic calculations , energies of single - particle levels are not shifted but taken exactly as provided by the deformed woods - saxon potential .",
    "expressions for m1 and e2 transition probabilities in terms of the rpa amplitudes are given in @xcite .",
    "the large single - particle basis allows us to work without effective charges @xmath26 when calculating @xmath27 values and e2 transition densities .",
    "the @xmath28 values and m1 transition densities are obtained with bare orbital and effective spin gyromagnetic factors .",
    "the latter account for the renormalization of the spin operator by a factor of 0.7 , i.e. , @xmath29    the strongest m1 transition found experimentally in @xmath2gd has an excitation energy @xmath30 mev and a reduced magnetic transition probability @xmath31(m1 ) = 1.30 @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "it is easily identified with the strongest theoretical m1 transition at 2.90 mev with @xmath31(m1 ) = 1.24 @xmath33 .",
    "our theoretical reduced probability for the accompanying e2 transition , @xmath31(e2 ) = 42 e@xmath34@xmath35 , agrees also well with the corresponding experimental value 40 @xmath36 e@xmath34@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31(e2 ) values of @xmath25 excitations are small because the main collectivity of the e2 strength of this mode is concentrated in the spurious rotational state , i.e. in the lowest e2 transition of the ground state rotational band .",
    "the @xmath0 cross sections are , however , much more sensitive to the details of the rpa wave functions than transition probabilities or excitation energies .",
    "we obtain the transition densities , necessary for the calculation of dwba cross sections , as reduced matrix elements of the corresponding multipole density operators between the nuclear ground state and the @xmath37-th rpa excitation with @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are longitudinal charge ( c2 ) and transverse current ( t@xmath42 ) density operators , respectively .",
