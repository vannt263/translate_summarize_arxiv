    "the systematic uncertainty is estimated to be up to @xmath340%  @xcite .",
    "we then derived a 0.2100  gev light curve composed mostly of 3-day bins ( fig .",
    "[ main_plot ] ) .",
    "such bin size ensures enough photon statistics in each bin without loosing information on short time - scale variability .",
    "finer binning ( e.g. 1-day ) results in low significance for most of the days and high statistical uncertainties in deriving fluxes and photon indices , except for the flaring period that occur between 2011 january 14 and february 3 . for data taken more than one month before and two months after the 2010 periastron passage ,",
    "larger bins were employed for better visualization . from 2010 december 15 to 2011 january 13 , no evidence for @xmath1-ray  emission was found , as first noted in  @xcite .",
    "we therefore derive an upper limit for the above quiescent period .",
    "data points represent the flux values with ts@xmath25 , for which photon indices are also shown . otherwise , an upper limit is derived .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ main_plot ] , the @xmath1-ray light curve is highly variable through the 2010 periastron passage : ( 1 ) the source started to be active in @xmath1-rays  about a month before 2010 periastron passage ( p1 ) ; ( 2 ) it remains undetected for about one month since mid - december ( q1 ) ; ( 3 ) subsequently , a major flaring period was identified ; it peaks at @xmath335 days after periastron . having an average flux higher than that in p1 by an order of magnitude , this flare lasted for only @xmath37 days ( p2 ) ; ( 4 ) a second flare that peaks at @xmath346 days after periastron , however , lasted longer , so that the source was detected until end of february ( p3 and p4 ) . to probe shorter time - scale variability during the flaring period ( i.e. , p2 and p3 )",
    ", we also produced the light curve with 1-day binning during january  14 to february  4 ( fig .",
    "[ zoomin_plot ] ) . here",
    "0.1100  gev photons were used to increase photon statistics .",
    "to better demonstrate the variability , we plot data points with ts@xmath25 ( rather than the more standard criterium of ts@xmath29 ) as flux values since a substantial number of data are of ts between 5 and 9 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath1-rays  from psr  b1259@xmath063/ls  2883  undergo rapid variations down to time scale of one day .",
    "such variability is one of the fastest detected from any galactic gev source on the sky .",
    "no emission was detected during january 2226 , indicating that the source underwent a short quiescent period between the two major flares .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ main_plot ] the orbital x - ray and tev light curves .",
    "the gev orbital light curve is different than the x - ray and tev light curves , suggesting that the origin of gev @xmath1-rays  is different than the others .",
    "as the derived photon indices change significantly with time , we defined four periods that are indicated in figure  [ main_plot ] and table  [ 4p ] .",
    "we further divided the 0.1 - 300  gev @xmath1-rays arriving during p1 , p2 , p3 , and p4 , respectively , into six energy bins of logarithmically equal bandwidths and reconstructed the flux using _ gtlike _ for each band independently .",
    "a power - law ( pl ) model for each bin was assumed and the photon spectral index was fixed at a representative value @xmath172.8 . while the emission is detected ( i.e. , ts@xmath25 ) from 1.4  gev to 20  gev for p1 , no @xmath1-ray source was apparent at the psr  b1259@xmath063  position in the four bins above 1.4  gev ( the derived ts values @xmath185 ) in the likelihood analysis for p2 , p3 , and p4 , indicating a cut - off at energy @xmath31  gev during the flaring period . see fig .",
    "[ sed ] for the spectrum derived from a combined analysis of p2 and p3 .",
    "we therefore attempted to fit the 0.1100  gev spectrum with a pl with an exponential cut - off ( ple ) , as well as a broken pl .",
    "we found that ple describes the spectrum even better during the periods p2 , p3 , and p4 , by @xmath19ts@xmath15ts@xmath20ts@xmath218 , i.e. , @xmath223@xmath13 in significance levels .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table  [ 4p ] .",
    "in particular , the cut - off energies were found to be 310@xmath23160  mev , 550@xmath23330  mev , and 250@xmath2395  mev during the periods p2 , p3 , and p4 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameters provided by the broken pl with all four parameters being free are not well constrained ; we therefore do not consider this model .    at a distance 2.3  kpc  @xcite , the average energy flux during the flares of @xmath33@xmath24  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath6 corresponds to the @xmath1-ray  luminosity 1.9@xmath25  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "given the pulsar spin - down luminosity @xmath38@xmath410@xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 , the average @xmath1-ray  efficiency is about 25% during the flares .    to demonstrate that gev emission originates from a component that is temporally and spectrally different than the tev emission , we put together the 100  mev to 300  gev spectra and the @xmath2300  gev @xmath1-ray  spectra obtained for different orbital phases in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "it is clear that the gev emission evolves differently compared to the tev emission , assuming that the tev behavior does not change dramatically between 2004 and 2010 periastron passages .      in fig .",
    "[ correlation_plot ] we plot @xmath1-ray  flux versus photon index , showing a correlation between these two quantities .",
    "we carried out a nonparametric correlation analysis .",
    "the computed spearman rank correlation coefficient between two quantities is @xmath26 .",
    "the probability that this coefficient is different than zero is 0.9959 . we have also calculated the linear correlation coefficient ( i.e. , pearson s r ) .",
    "this results in pearson s r@xmath27 and the probability that this coefficient is different than zero is 0.9986 .",
    "high - energy emissions from @xmath1-ray binaries ( psr  b1259 - 63 , ls  5039 , and ls  i+@xmath28 ) have been discussed using leptonic models ( e.g. , tavani & arons , 1997 ; dubus 2006 ; takata & taam 2009 ) and hadronic models ( e.g. , kawachi et al .",
    "2004 ; chernyakova et al .",
    "2009 ) . in leptonic models , pw particles ( electrons and positrons ) are accelerated at the shock where the dynamical pressure of the pw and that of the stellar wind are in balance .",
    "these particles in turn emit non - thermal photons over a wide range of energies via synchrotron radiation ( radio to gev @xmath1-rays ) and inverse - compton ( ic ) upscattering off star light ( @xmath210  gev @xmath1-rays ) , resulting in two peaks in the broadband spectrum . in hadronic models  ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inverse compton emission of high - energy electrons resulting from @xmath29-decay is responsible for emission from optical up to tev energies . in this case",
    ", the broadband spectrum is rather flat in the energy range of 0.1100  gev .    during the pre - periastron epoch ,",
    "gev emission at a flux level @xmath30  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath6 is detected from mid - november through mid - december .",
    "the fitted spectrum during this period ( p1 ) is relatively hard ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "such hardness may be consistent with the predictions of both the hadronic and the leptonic models ( see below for a discussion of the leptonic interpretation during this period ) .    the onset of the flare - like gev emission at the true anomaly @xmath32 occurred close to the disk passage at the true anomaly @xmath33 , suggesting that the origin of the @xmath1-rays  might be related to the disk passage . on one hand , the observed cut - off at several hundred mev does not favor hadronic models . on the other hand",
    ", it may be difficult to explain the flare - like gev emission using simple leptonic models as well .",
    "first , leptonic models predict a cut - off around 100  mev for a synchrotron spectrum  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the stellar disk pushes the shock towards the pulsar when the pulsar encounters the disk .",
    "although the increase of the magnetic field enhances the synchrotron power , it also reduces the synchrotron cooling time of the accelerated particles . as gev photons",
    "are emitted by fast - cooling particles , these two effects should compensate each other .",
    "consequently , the shift of the shock position due to the stellar disk can not enhance the gev emission to the level that we observe .",
    "doppler boosting may provide a plausible mechanism to produce the gev flares during january  14  february  3 , 2011  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations in the hydrodynamic limit imply that the post shock bulk flow for the binary system can be accelerated into relativistic regime because of a rapid expansion of the flow in the downstream region ( bogovalov et al .",
    "for example , dubus et al . (",
    "2010 ) discussed the effects of doppler boosting on the orbital modulations of the x - ray and tev emission .",
    "if the bulk flow is relativistic and oriented radially away from the star , the doppler effect may be at work close to the true anomaly corresponding to the direction of the earth ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this is approximately the time when the gev flares were observed ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the doppler effect increases the photon energy as @xmath35 and the intensity as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the doppler factor , and @xmath38 the spectral index .",
    "non - prime and prime notations represent quantities in the observer and co - moving frames , respectively .    in @xmath1-rays",
    ", @xmath39 is expected from synchrotron radiation models , which is consistent with the fermi results .",
    "an enhancement factor of 510 in flux during flares ( p2 and p3 ) compared to the emission before periastron ( p1 ; see table  [ 4p ] for details ) suggests @xmath401.52 .",
    "suzaku observations indicate a low energy break , i.e. , around 10  kev  @xcite .",
    "because the photon index of the synchrotron spectrum below the break is @xmath41 , the enhancement factor becomes @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the enhancement in x - rays is suppressed compared to @xmath1-rays .",
    "it is important to obtain simultaneous observations in x - rays and gamma - rays during the flaring period to test the boosting model .    in leptonic models , the correlation between @xmath43 and flux ( fig .",
    "[ correlation_plot ] ) may be understood as follows .",
    "if the doppler effect is responsible for the flares , photons are boosted to higher energies and the observed synchrotron flux is amplified .",
    "however , the doppler boost does not affect much the photon flux of the ic component , since more scatters between particles and incident photons would occur in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "consequently , the increase in the ic flux by the doppler boosting and the decrease due to the klein - nishina effect will compensate each other .",
    "the energy flux of the synchrotron radiation becomes much higher than the ic radiation , causing the 0.1100  gev spectrum to be dominated by the high - energy tail of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "this gives rise to the steep spectrum ( @xmath33 ; corresponding to flare emission ) shown in fig .",
    "[ correlation_plot ] .",
    "the emission before periastron ( with @xmath442 ) may be related to emission originating just behind the shock where the bulk lorentz factor is @xmath31 . some leptonic models ( e.g. takata et al . 2009 ; dubus et al .",
    "2010 ) have predicted similar energy fluxes of synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation just behind the shock , hence @xmath31 , which is close to the observed value in the power - law fit . although there is no evidence for two spectral components during the pre - periastron period ( see fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) , this possibility can not be excluded given the relatively low significance detection , i.e. , @xmath35@xmath13 , during this period .      1 .   for ls  i+61 303 and psr  b1259 - 63",
    ", the gev gamma - ray peak occurs after periastron ( and before apastron ) , though not in the same orbital phase . for ls  5039",
    ", the gamma - ray emission peaked at periastron ; 2 .",
    "while no orbital phase - related spectral change has been reported in ls  i+@xmath28 , the `` softer when brighter '' behavior of gev @xmath1-rays  has been found for both ls  5039 and psr  b1259 - 63 ; 3 .   in all three systems ,",
    "spectral cutoff is observed at gev energies during at least part of the orbit ; 4 .   in all three systems ,",
    "the x - ray and tev light curves are more correlated whereas gev @xmath1-rays  always come out in different orbital phases  @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that gev @xmath1-rays  originate from components different than the other two energy bands .",
    "psr  b1259@xmath063/ls  2883  is the only system among these three for which the nature of the compact object is certain .",
    "given the similarities of some emission features of these systems , the results presented here should shed light on the gev radiation mechanism of the other systems .",
