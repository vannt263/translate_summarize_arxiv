    "we call such a slope @xmath5 the _ surgery slope_. it is well - known that a slope on the boundary torus @xmath8 is parameterized by an element of @xmath9 by using the standard meridian - longitude system for @xmath2 .",
    "thus , when a slope @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath10 , we call the dehn surgery along @xmath5 the _ @xmath11-surgery _ for brevity , and denote @xmath6 by @xmath12 . since @xmath13 is homeomorphic to @xmath3 again , @xmath14-surgery is called the _ trivial _ surgery .",

    "a knot is called _ hyperbolic _ if its complement admits a complete hyperbolic structure of finite volume .",
    "thereby a dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot is called _ exceptional _ if it yields a non - hyperbolic manifold . as a consequence of the geometrization conjecture , raised by thurston  (",
    "* , question 1 ) , and established by perelman s works  @xcite , exceptional surgeries are classified into the three types : a seifert fibered surgery , a toroidal surgery , and a reducible surgery . here",
    "a dehn surgery is called _ seifert fibered _ / _ toroidal _",
    "/ _ reducible _ if it yields a seifert fibered / toroidal / reducible manifold .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a survey .",
    "we here note that the classification is not exclusive , that is , there exist seifert fibered 3-manifolds which are both toroidal and reducible . however , hyperbolic knots in @xmath3 are conjectured to admit no reducible surgeries .",
    "this is the well - known , but still open , cabling conjecture @xcite .",
    "thus we consider in this paper a dehn surgery on a knot in @xmath3 yielding a @xmath0-manifold which is toroidal and seifert fibered , which we call a _ toroidal seifert fibered surgery_.    actually there exist infinitely many hyperbolic knots in @xmath3 each of which admits a toroidal seifert fibered surgery .",

    "* proposition 4.5(1 ) and ( 3 ) ) , and gordon and luecke @xcite independently . on the other hand , motegi  @xcite studied toroidal seifert fibered surgeries on symmetric knots , and gave several restrictions on the existence of such surgeries .",

    "the minimal number of such rational tangles is called the _ length _ of a montesinos knot . in particular , a montesinos knot @xmath2 is called a _ pretzel knot _ of type @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 , if the rational tangles in @xmath2 are of the form @xmath21 .    , scaledwidth=30.0% ]    exceptional surgeries on montesinos knots are extensively studied .",
