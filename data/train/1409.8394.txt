    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene has been extensively studied during recent years because of its fundamental and technological interest . @xcite",
    "although it is possible to grow graphene on non - polar substrates,@xcite in most currently available graphene samples ( e.g. , graphene field - effect transistors ) graphene lies on top of a polar substrate such as sio@xmath1,@xcite sic,@xcite hbn@xcite or hfo@xmath1.@xcite in such graphene samples the polar optical phonons of the substrate are localized near the graphene - substrate interface , and free carriers in graphene couple to the surface polar ( so ) phonons of the underlying substrate through the long - range polar frhlich coupling . in polar materials the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons generate a long - range electric field which scatters electrons , and typically their contribution to resistivity is dominant at room temperatures .",
    "@xcite in non - polar materials such as graphene , however , the non - polar optical phonons have little effect on carrier transport because the long - range interaction between electrons and phonons is absent and the energy of the ( non - polar ) optical phonon is very high , @xmath2200 mev . in addition , contributions from acoustic phonons@xcite are relatively small because the electron - acoustic - phonon coupling is rather weak in graphene due to the small deformation potential.@xcite for this reason , the so phonons rather than non - polar lo or acoustic phonons can be the dominant scattering source at room temperature in graphene on a polar substrate .",
    "@xcite    in addition to being the main scattering source in transport , it is well known that in polar materials the electron - polar - optical - phonon interaction leads to polaronic many - body renormalization of the single particle properties , e.g. , polaronic fermi velocity ( effective mass ) renormalization and broadening of the quasiparticle spectral function.@xcite even though these effects are expected to be small in graphene due to the weak frhlich coupling arising from the spatial separation between electrons in graphene and the surface of a substrate and due to the large dielectric constant of the substrate , there is a much stronger quantitative manifestation of electron - so - phonon coupling in graphene on a polar substrate , which is the macroscopic coupling of the electronic collective modes ( i.e. , plasmons ) to the so phonons of the system via the long - range frhlich coupling .",
    "this mode coupling phenomenon , which hybridizes the collective plasmon modes of the electron gas with the so - phonon modes of the substrate , gives rise to coupled plasmon - phonon modes , which have been extensively studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite in graphene .",
    "the plasmon - phonon coupling is important in many single - particle properties including the inelastic carrier life time , hot - electron energy - loss processes , and transport properties .",
    "the objective of this paper is to provide the inelastic carrier lifetime and the inelastic mean free path of monolayer and bilayer graphene in the presence of the long - range polar frhlich coupling between electrons in graphene and so phonons in the underlying polar substrate within the leading - order perturbation theory , i.e. , g@xmath0w approximation .",
    "we consider the effective total interaction ( i.e. , the coupled electron - electron and electron - so - phonon interaction ) within the framework of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "even though the problem is treated within the g@xmath0w framework of the leading - order effective interaction approximation , our results should be quite valid in graphene because graphene has a very weak frhlich coupling , which justifies the neglect of the electron - phonon vertex corrections .",
    "we include , however , important physical effects of the dynamical screening , phonon self - energy correction , plasmon - phonon mode coupling , and landau damping . in the presence of electron - so - phonon coupling",
    "we find added features in the inelastic carrier lifetime , which are obviously absent without the coupling .",
    "there have been several studies upon the effects of electron - so - phonon interaction in graphene.@xcite various many - body quantities such as- the self - energy , scattering rate , and spectral function have been calculated for the statically screened electron - so- phonon interaction .",
    "such calculations based on the static screening approximation are justified when the charge carrier density is high enough that the corresponding fermi energy exceeds the so phonon energy . however , the so phonon energies of the common polar substrates for graphene such as sic or sio@xmath1 range from 50 to 200 mev , and they are comparable to the typical fermi energies of graphene , 100  300 mev .",
    "thus the dynamic screening of the electron - so- phonon interaction is more desirable . @xcite in addition , because the so phonon energy and the energy of electrons are comparable , we can not treat the electron - electron interaction and the electron - so phonon interaction separately .",
    "therefore , we need to treat both interactions equivalently within the same dynamic screening approximation . quasiparticle properties of various systems have been calculated considering both electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions.@xcite however , there appears to be a lack of calculation of quasiparticle properties of graphene on a polar substrate with both electron - electron and electron - so - phonon interactions equally treated .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the scattering rate ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) and the corresponding inelastic mean free path ( @xmath5 ) of quasiparticles in both monolayer and bilayer graphene by taking into account both electron - electron and electron - so - phonon interactions .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the dynamic screening of the electron - so - phonon interaction and plasmon - phonon coupling . in addition , we propose a possible technological application to a lateral hot - electron transistor by making use of the electron - so- phonon interaction effect . throughout the paper",
    ", we refer to the graphene system with both electron - electron and electron - so - phonon interactions as the coupled system , whereas the graphene system with only the electron - electron interaction as the uncoupled system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the generalized theory is presented for calculating the electron self - energy in the presence of both electron - electron and electron - so phonon interactions .",

    "for monolayer graphene , this model holds over the fermi energy range limited by intralayer coupling ( @xmath163 ev ) while for bilayer graphene it is valid for the fermi energy range limited by the interlayer coupling ( @xmath170.4 ev ) , which is still within the range we are considering in this work . note that if the fermi energy or the corresponding carrier density is high enough , the interlayer hopping @xmath9 can be negligible and the bilayer graphene is simply described by a collection of two monolayer graphene sheets .",

    "on the other hand , in bilayer graphene the fermi temperature at low densities @xmath36 @xmath33 ( @xmath37 k ) is smaller than room temperature , and thus the zero temperature approximation is valid only at relatively high densities @xmath38 @xmath33(@xmath39 k ) in bilayer graphene .",

    "hence , an injected electron with a higher energy can have more routes to decay than that injected with a low energy .    for the uncoupled monolayer graphene",
    ", the quasiparticle can not decay via plasmon emission because the plasmon dispersion does not enter the ieel continua over the whole energy range , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) .",
    "thus the scattering rate in doped graphene does not show an abrupt increase at any energy.@xcite on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) , for the coupled system there are two modes : the phononlike mode @xmath77 and the plasmonlike mode @xmath78 . the plasmonlike mode @xmath79 enters the ieel continua at a finite critical wave vector @xmath80.@xcite thus an additional decay channel via @xmath78 emission",
    "is turned on around the so phonon energy @xmath81 , leading to an upward step in the scattering rate .",
    "note that decay via the emission of the phononlike mode @xmath82 is impossible for monolayer graphene because the @xmath82 mode increases linearly at large @xmath83 with energy slightly higher than that of the uncoupled plasmon mode and thus it does not enter the ieel continua .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the scattering rate and the loss function in uncoupled and coupled bilayer graphene . unlike the situation with monolayer graphene , the plasmon dispersions for both uncoupled and coupled bilayer graphene enter the ieel continua .",
    "therefore , even in the uncoupled system the scattering rate exhibits an abrupt increase , which is absent in the uncoupled monolayer system .",
    "in addition , while the coupled monolayer graphene system has only a single jump in the scattering rate , the coupled bilayer graphene shows two abrupt jumps .",
    "one of them occurs near @xmath84 , for which the emission of the phononlike mode @xmath82 damped in the interband spe is responsible .",
    "the other jump occurs due to the emission of the plasmonlike mode @xmath85 and its threshold energy strongly depends upon the carrier density , hence the emission of the plasmonlike mode @xmath85 is tunable with a carrier density . at higher carrier densities ( @xmath86 the plasmon",
    "is strongly coupled to the so phonon and the threshold energy for the phononlike mode @xmath82 becomes a tunable quantity while the threshold energy for the plasmonlike @xmath85 is fixed around the so phonon energy @xmath87.@xcite note that in bilayer graphene the step of the scattering rate at the phononlike mode shows a weaker density dependence on the carrier density than that in monolayer graphene because of the constant density of states . also note that our calculation for bilayer graphene is based on the two band model which is valid only at low carrier densities . at high enough carrier densities ,",
    "the interlayer coupling becomes negligible and the energy band structure of bilayer graphene behaves as a collection of monolayer graphene sheets , thus we expect that the results for bilayer graphene are similar to those of monolayer graphene . at such high densities ,",
    "the density - dependent jump would disappear and only one single jump around @xmath87 would be found in the scattering rate , as in the monolayer case .",
    "we also note that high - energy plasmon modes are known to exist in bilayer graphene.@xcite when an electron is injected with sufficiently high energies , a decay through the emission of the high - energy plasmon modes could be possible , leading to additional jumps in the scattering rate .",
    "such jumps are not captured by the two - band effective model and thus beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the inelastic mean free paths @xmath89 of the uncoupled and coupled monolayer graphene systems are given in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) . unlike the uncoupled system ,",
    "the coupled system shows a sharp decrease in the inelastic mean free path at the so phonon energy @xmath87 at which the emission of plasmonlike mode is turned on and an electron loses its energy significantly .",
    "thus , by injecting an electron below or above @xmath87 , we can change the mean free path of the system significantly , which can be used for designing a lateral hot electron transistor device in the coupled monolayer graphene system.@xcite figure [ fig:4](b ) shows the inelastic mean free path for bilayer graphene systems .",
    "the mean free path in bilayer graphene is much shorter than that in monolayer graphene and the step of the mean free path is very small around @xmath87 .",
    "thus the bilayer graphene may not be a good candidate for the application to a lateral hot electron transistor utilizing the electron - phonon interaction . at low energies , however , the inelastic mean free path strongly depends on the carrier density because the threshold energy of the plasmonlike mode @xmath90 is approximately proportional to the fermi energy .",

    "we discuss the effect of dynamical screening of the electron - so - phonon interaction compared with the results calculated with static screening .",
    "we also discuss the effects of finite so - phonon lifetime and multiple so - phonon modes of the polar substrate .",
    "the static screening is equivalent to putting @xmath97 in @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phonon_propagator ] ) , which means that the electrons screen the so phonons statically , while electron - electron interactions are treated dynamically to take into account the plasmon effects .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows the scattering rates for different carrier densities in monolayer and bilayer graphene with the static or dynamic screening approximations .",
    "we find that at low densities the scattering rates with static screening are larger than those with dynamic screening for both monolayer and bilayer graphene , while at high densities the results with dynamic screening are larger than those with static screening .",
    "these effects may arise from the attractive nature of the phonon - mediated effective interaction , which originates from the retardation effect coming from the mass difference between ions and electrons . at low densities ,",
    "the negative contribution to the scattering rate from the attractive effective interaction is significant , and the static screening suppresses the negative contribution more strongly than the dynamic screening , giving a larger scattering rate .",
    "as the carrier density increases , the negative contribution to the scattering rate becomes negligible , and the scattering rate with the static screening approximation becomes smaller than that with the dynamic screening , as shown in the bottom panel of [ fig:5 ] .    in our calculations , we assume an infinite lifetime for so phonons because the inclusion of the finite lifetime just suppresses the jumps in the scattering rate without making any qualitative change . furthermore , the typical decay rates of so phonons are so small ( @xmath21 mev ) compared to so phonon energies that the effect of the finite phonon lifetime is quantitatively negligible .    we also assume in our calculations that only one single",
    "so phonon mode is present in substrates . if multiple so phonon",
    "modes exist , as in sio@xmath1 , each mode couples to the electron motion independently , giving a jump in the scattering rate near the phonon mode energy .",
    "our results based on one single phonon mode correspond to each of these jumps , and thus extension to multiple phonon modes from our results is trivial .    in conclusion , we theoretically calculated the inelastic scattering rates @xmath99 and the hot - electron inelastic mean free paths @xmath5 for both monolayer and bilayer graphene on a substrate made of polar materials , treating the electron - electron interaction and the electron - so - phonon interaction on an equal footing . in our theoretical calculation , we include the interaction between electrons , so phonons , and plasmons within the rpa ( for dynamical screening and phonon self - energy correction ) and within the leading - order self - energy in the effective total interaction .",
    "we find that the strong coupling between the so phonon and the plasmon leads to an additional decay channel for the quasiparticles through the emission of the coupled mode and gives rise to an abrupt increase in the scattering rate , which is absent in the uncoupled system . in monolayer",
    "graphene a single jump in the scattering rate occurs around @xmath87 , arising from the emission of the low energy branch of the coupled modes . by varying the energy of an injected electron",
