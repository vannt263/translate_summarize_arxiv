    "note that since the @xmath69 from dark matter relic abundance , the three - body decay of @xmath50 with a final @xmath12 lepton is kinematically suppressed .    .",
    "there are two sources of cp asymmetry from each of the new yukawa interactions as drawn in fig .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that due to the boltzmann suppression factor at temperatures below the gauge boson masses , they can not wash - out the lepton asymmetry in an efficient way .",
    "we should emphasis here that the dm @xmath15 is formed in the decays of @xmath50 ( in the process of nucleosynthesis ) and @xmath83 ( in the process of leptogenesis ) .",

    "note the new particles must be produced in pairs according to @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the novel signatures will be the missing energy while producing the dm @xmath15 , and the decays of @xmath51 and @xmath91 are mainly into @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the charged particles in our model will leave charged tracks in detectors and provide clean signatures due to their long lifetimes .",
    "one should note that @xmath50 and @xmath94 can only be produced through @xmath17 which is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "in summary , we propose a model which can give neutrino mass with radiative seesaw mechanism and can account for the muon anomalous magnetic moment . in these two cases the gim mechanism associated with the scale parameter @xmath11 plays an important role . by setting @xmath95 the relic abundance of dark matter from inert doublet scalar",
    "can be realized , and a long - lived negative charged particle which can fulfill the cbbn scheme for the lithium problem .",
