    "over the past few years , a number of papers have revisited the issue of the non - universality of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in the unresolved stellar populations of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) . at present",
    ", there are three independent probes of the imf in the unresolved , nearly quiescent populations of etgs , based on the modelling of the kinematics ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; constraining the mass in strong gravitational lenses that probe the projected mass distribution in the central regions of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or via gravity - sensitive spectroscopic features ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the first two probes are sensitive to the stellar m / l , and their major systematic relates to the contribution of the dark matter halo in the central regions of galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic constraints are mostly sensitive to the ratio between giant and dwarf stars , and its main systematic is the degeneracy with the additional parameters of the underlying stellar populations , most notably the effect of variations in the individual elemental abundances .",
    "we focus here on this issue .",
    "a large effort has been made to understand this systematic in detail .",
    "the bottleneck in the analysis is the lack of robust models of stellar atmospheres , and their response to abundance effects . on this front ,",
    "population synthesis modellers follow either a theoretical approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or an empirical methodology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the theoretical approach relies on predictions from stellar atmosphere models to construct stellar population models that best match the observed spectra , while the empirical approach targets the deviation of the data from solar - scaled stellar population models to measure the abundance effects . at present ,",
    "both methods are needed to be able to improve our understanding of line strengths in unresolved stellar populations . on the issue of imf variations ,",
    "a number of papers have recently strengthened the idea that etgs feature a non - universal imf ( see  @xcite , as well as  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fer13 and lb13 , respectively ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the analysis has gone as far as providing tentative drivers of imf variations , suggesting either [ mg / fe ] @xcite , velocity dispersion ( fer13 , lb13 ,  @xcite ) , metallicity @xcite , or more complex physical observables @xcite .",
    "studies combining galaxy dynamics and spectroscopic features of the same galaxies have revealed potentially serious systematics @xcite , although such effects could be strongly model - dependent @xcite .",
    "in addition , constraints based on strong gravitational lensing are inconclusive : while  @xcite find agreement with the dynamical modelling , several massive lensing etgs feature stellar m / l values consistent with a kroupa - like imf  @xcite .",
    "critics have voiced concerns on the interpretation of the line strength variations as an imf trend , proposing instead large departures from the solar - scaled abundance of individual elements such as sodium @xcite .",
    "it is therefore imperative to understand in detail the potential systematics ( most notably , the effect of elemental abundances , age , and metallicity ) . on the spectroscopic analysis side  the focus of this paper ",
    "it is necessary to put under the microscope several spectral features , ideally with varying levels of dependence on the parameters under scrutiny .",
    "the main target of the present work is a luminous etg , hereafter xsg1 , selected from the spider survey  @xcite , more specifically from the subsample of @xmath6 etgs with @xmath7  kms@xmath2  defined by lb13 .",
    "we have gathered new , very deep , `` high '' resolution ( @xmath8 ) , long - slit spectroscopy for xsg1 with the x - shooter spectrograph on the eso - very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "the combination of depth , resolution , and wavelength range for xsg1 gives us a unique opportunity to single out the effect of the imf against the other stellar population parameters ( in particular abundance ratios ) , as a function of galacto - centric distance , advancing our previous work  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mn15a ) . to this effect , we focus on the optical , tio - based , spectral features , combining them with the near - infrared tio feature , @xmath9 , at @xmath108860 , and the wing - ford band , @xmath11  ( @xmath109915 ) .",

    "observations were done through five observing blocks ( obs ) , each including two exposures on target , interspersed by two sky exposures ( through an object - sky - sky - object sequence ) , with the same integration time as for the science target . for each ob",
    ", the on - target exposure time was 20.4 , 22.6 , and 25  min , resulting into a total exposure time of @xmath41.7 , 1.9 , and @xmath21  hr , in the x - shooter uvb , vis , and nir arms , respectively .",
    "the observations were carried out in service mode during two consecutive nights at the end of march 2014 ( 4 out of 5 obs ) , and completed at the end of february 2015 .",
    "all data were taken under photometric conditions , with seeing fwhm varying from @xmath22 to @xmath23arcsec in the optical , with a mean value of @xmath24arcsec .",

    "the pointing was nodded by a few pixels along the slit among exposures , in order to perform an optimal removal of cosmic rays and detector defects ( e.g. hot columns / pixels ) during data reduction . a hot ( white dwarf ) spectro - photometric standard star , together with a few ( 37 ) telluric ( b - type ) standards were observed during each night ( the latter taken before and after each science ob ) in order to perform flux calibration and correct the spectra for telluric lines , respectively .    as part of the same observing campaign as xsg1 ,",
    "we have also observed a second target , a massive ( @xmath30 ; @xmath31kms@xmath2 ) etg ( hereafter xsg2 ; sdss j002819.30 - 001446.7 ; z=@xmath32 ; @xmath33  ) also selected from the spider survey , with a more typical @xmath0 $ ]  ( @xmath34  dex ) for its velocity dispersion .",

    "this different strategy , resulting into half of the total integration time spent on sky , allowed us to perform shorter individual exposures , in order to test the quality of sky subtraction in the nir , where the fast variability of sky lines may hamper the analysis of the spectra , especially in the outer , low surface - brightness regions .",

    "the echelle layout of x - shooter produces 1216 curved and highly distorted spectral orders per arm , requiring a complex reduction process .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed description of all issues related to the data reduction of x - shooter uvb- and vis - arm data . for our purposes",
    ", we performed the data reduction using version 2.4.0 of the x - shooter data - reduction pipeline  @xcite , optimized with dedicated fortran software developed by the authors .",
    "we ran the x - shooter pipeline in `` physical '' mode , through the eso command - line utility esorex .",
    "for each arm , the data ( i.e. science and sky , as well as standard star frames ) were entirely pre - reduced with the x - shooter pipeline , including de - biasing , correction for dark frames ( nir - arm only ) , rectification of echelle orders , wavelength - calibration , and merging of the orders .",
    "the remaining reduction steps were performed as follows :     _ flux calibration _ - : :    for the uvb and vis arms , we found significant differences among    reference spectra of standard stars to the flux - calibrated ones    computed by the pipeline , being as high as 510@xmath35 in    regions affected by strong telluric lines ( for the vis arm ) .",
    "for this    reason , we applied an iterative procedure to improve the response    function of the pipeline .",
    "the spectrum of each flux - calibrated    standard star is corrected for tellurics with the same procedure as    for the science data ( see below ) .",
    "then , for each echelle order , we    derive the ratio of the corrected standard - star spectrum to its    tabulated version .",
    "the ratio is fitted , order - by - order , with legendre    polynomials of suitable orders ( from one to twelve , depending on the    spectral order ) , and the best - fitting polynomials are used to update    the response function ( for each observing night ) . the procedure is    iterated a few times , until a variation below 1@xmath35 ( the    typical accuracy of our flux calibration ) is achieved in the updated    response function , at all wavelengths . for the nir arm , the spectrum    of the flux - calibrated standard - star , produced by the pipeline , turned    out to have large deviations ( up to @xmath36 ) with    respect to the tabulated flux values .",
    "these deviations , with typical    scales of @xmath37 , are likely due to residual    sky - emission and telluric lines affecting the cubic - spline fit    performed by the pipeline when deriving the response function .    therefore , we applied the flux - calibration of the nir arm with a    dedicated procedure . for each observing night , the ( one - dimensional )    non - calibrated standard - star spectrum is corrected for tellurics with    the software molecfit ( see below ) .",
    "intrinsic ( mostly hydrogen )    absorption lines , from the stellar atmospheres , are removed , by    fitting them with a linear combination of multiple gaussian functions .",
    "we compute the ratio of the resulting spectrum to the tabulated one by    carefully masking out regions with strong telluric absorption    ( @xmath38 ) and removing pixels with spurious spikes ( e.g.    from cosmic rays or residuals of sky lines ) , through a    2-@xmath39 clipping procedure .",
    "the resulting ratio is    fitted with a second - order spline to produce an initial response    function .",
    "this response is applied to each telluric standard - star    observed during the night .",
    "the continuum of the telluric standard is    modelled , and removed , with two black - body ( bb ) laws , one for bluer    and another one for redder wavelengths with respect to the brackett    jump ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the temperatures of the two    bbs are obtained by a best - fitting procedure .",
    "the resulting signal ,    median - smoothed , and averaged over all telluric - standards observed    during the night , was applied as a correction to the initial response ,    to derive the final response function . comparing the central spectrum    of xsg1 among different exposures / nights , we have estimated that our    nir flux - calibration is accurate at    @xmath41 .",
    "_ sky subtraction _ - : :    our targets  with an effective radius around @xmath42   fill    the whole x - shooter 11  slit .",
    "therefore , sky subtraction can not be    performed in the standard way of interpolating the sky from the two    sides of the slit .",
    "we performed sky subtraction with the software    skycorr  @xcite .",
    "given the two - dimensional spectrum of the object ,    @xmath43 , we consider the nearest sky frame , @xmath44 .",
    "we extract a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectrum from both @xmath44    and @xmath43 , by median - combining each frame over an 8-pixel    region , using four pixels from each edge of the slit ( where the signal    from the galaxy is less prominent ) .",
    "we run skycorr to determine the    optimal scaling factors ( depending on wavelength ) that match the 1d    spectrum of the sky to that of the object frames .",
    "the scaling factors    are then applied to rescale @xmath44 , and subtract it from    @xmath43 .",
    "_ telluric correction _ - : :    telluric lines were removed from each object exposure individually .    for the vis arm , we adopted two independent approaches , by ( i ) using    telluric standard stars observed during our programme , and ( ii ) using    the software molecfit  @xcite . in case ( i )",

    "indeed , the correlation of imf with @xmath0 $ ]  in  @xcite might be driven by the fact that cvd12 models are computed at fixed [ fe / h ] , rather than total metallicity .    recently ,  @xcite investigated the origin of radial trends of imf - sensitive features in two nearby etgs , with @xmath190kms@xmath2  ( ngc@xmath1911023 ) and @xmath192kms@xmath2  ( ngc@xmath1912974 ) , respectively .",

    "although the radial behaviour of the imf might be flat in some massive etgs ( see above ) , we emphasize that , in practice , the presence of abundance- and imf - gradients can coexist , hampering a direct interpretation of the indices .",

    "[ app : atio_mgf ] ) . for some features , like @xmath11 ,",
    "the interpretation is even trickier . according to predictions from new nir ( extended miles ) stellar population models with varying total metallicity _ and _ imf , the @xmath11  response to ( total ) metallicity  and thus also to @xmath0 $ ]  at fixed @xmath85$] is larger at higher metallicity .",

    "for instance , in lb13 ( see figure  15 ) the response of nai8200 ( cat ) to @xmath267 $ ]  ( @xmath269 $ ] ) was shown to be likely stronger ( weaker ) for ssp models with a bottom - heavy imf , relative to kroupa .",
    "this coupling , not included in any publicly - available version of stellar population models with varying abundance ratios ( e.g. cvd12 ) , might be responsible for some of the apparent contradictions between model predictions and observations  @xcite .",
    "our analysis of optical and nir features in xsg1 is inconsistent with a unimodal , single power - law imf , favouring a functional form tapered off at the low - mass end , such as the bimodal imf of  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this result does not imply that the imf functional form has to be bimodal .",
    "as discussed in fer13 and lb13 , unimodal imf models are also disfavoured by the fact that they predict overly high stellar @xmath232 ratios with respect to simple dynamical constraints .",
    "however , a possible way out is to assume a unimodal parametrization , increasing the low mass - end cutoff , @xmath270 , in the imf ( with @xmath271 ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , very - low mass stars ( @xmath272 ) do not contribute significantly to the integrated galaxy light , while they provide a major contribution to the @xmath273 . since the wing - ford band is sensitive to the very low - mass stars in the imf ( see figure  17 of cvd12 ) , increasing @xmath274",
    "might also reconcile optical and nir indicators for xsg1 , in the same way as adopting a bimodal imf .",
    "however , this option is rather contrived , and would beg the question of why such a gap exists between low - mass stars and massive brown dwarves .",
    "an alternative approach , taken by  @xcite , is to assume a three - segment set of power laws for the imf , describing individually the behaviour of very - low , and low , mass stars . in this parametrization",

    "while the information on the detailed shape of the imf is imprinted in the optical and nir features of a galaxy spectrum ( cvd12 ) , it is not clear if this information can be recovered , mostly because of current uncertainties on stellar population models , and on modelling the effect of variations in the abundance ratios on the targeted spectral features . _ regardless of the detailed shape of the imf , one important result from the present work is that spectroscopic constraints are inconsistent with a pure unimodal parametrization of the imf extended down to the h - core burning stellar mass limit .",
