    "laser interferometry is an unambiguous diagnostic tool for measuring line - integrated plasma density and so is extensively used .",
    "it is generally believed that the path lengths of the scene and reference beams of the interferometer must be equal and this requirement has been incorporated into existing interferometers@xcite .",
    "this leads to complicated optics alignment procedures over long distances .",
    "the assumed reason for maintaining equal path lengths of the scene and reference beams is to ensure coherent phases of the two beams .",
    "the extent to which the phases of the beams are coherent is determined by the phase auto - correlation function of the laser .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that having equal path lengths is unnecessary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : laser - phase - auto - correlation ] shows that the phase auto - correlation function , a measure of the coherence , is a quasi - periodic function of the path length difference between the two beams .",
    "the phase auto - correlation function peaks at path length difference @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cavity length of the laser .",
    "interferometer design can be simplified by operating at a path length difference corresponding to one of these peaks .",
    "section [ sec : interferometer - setup ] describes the setup of an interferometer being used on a spheromak formation experiment at caltech@xcite .",
    "the interferometer uses a laser with a @xmath4 cm cavity length and operates at a path length difference of @xmath5 m. typical results from this interferometer are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper with a summary .",
    "a gas laser contains an active medium within a resonating optical cavity bounded by mirrors on either end .",
    "the mirrors allow only those optical modes which traverse an integer number of half - wavelengths within the cavity .",
    "the frequencies of these optical modes are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the speed of light and @xmath3 is the distance between the cavity mirrors .",
    "these discrete frequencies are separated by @xmath8 . for a typical he - ne",
    "gas laser with a cavity length of @xmath9 cm , the modes are separated by @xmath10 mhz .",
    "power spectrum of a laser showing doppler gain curve , discrete frequency resonance modes and two possible levels of cavity loss@xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the active medium between the mirrors can be considered as a narrow - band optical amplifier .",
    "the gain curve for this amplifier is centered around the frequency @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 is the energy released by the atomic transition that emits the photon .",
    "only a few of the discrete frequencies given by eq.[eq : resonator - discrete - frequencies ] appear in the laser beam .",
    "these are the amplified modes , the others are attenuated by the medium .",
    "for example , in a commercial red he - ne laser , photons are emitted because of transition of ne atoms from a @xmath13 state to @xmath14 state , which corresponds to a center frequency of @xmath15 thz .",
    "the gain curve is primarily doppler broadened@xcite by an amount @xmath16 where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath18 is the gas temperature and @xmath19 is the molecular mass of the radiating atom . for a collection of ne atoms emitting light at the he - ne wavelength of @xmath20 nm at room temperature ,",
    "the doppler width is @xmath21 ghz .",
    "thus , an amplifier with gain width @xmath22 ghz allows about @xmath23 modes separated by @xmath10 mhz , as sketched in fig.[fig : laser - power - spectrum ] .",
    "power will build up from noise in modes for which the gain exceeds the losses . as the power in modes builds up , modes will saturate and equilibrate , so that the gain balances the losses .",
    "modes for which the losses exceed the gain are severely attenuated . for example ,",
    "if loss - line @xmath24 in fig.[fig : laser - power - spectrum ] represents the losses in the system , a monochromatic wave will exist , the one closest to the peak of the amplifier gain function . on the other hand ,",
    "if the losses are represented by loss line @xmath25 , there will be @xmath26 distinct modes in the wave .",
    "power in various modes is distributed according to the amplifier gain profile and losses in the system@xcite .",
    "the wave electric field in the polarization direction for an ideal laser can be represented as :    [ eq : resonator - electric - field ] @xmath27    where @xmath28 .",
    "functions and variables in the frequency domain will be represented by a `` tilde . ''",
    "equation [ eq : resonator - electric - field - b ] is just a fourier transform relation .",
    "thus the fourier transform of the electric field for an ideal laser is a series of delta functions , with the non - zero fourier coefficients @xmath29 corresponding to the non - attenuated modes .",
    "the discrete resonant frequency modes of a laser are each broadened by a small amount @xmath30 , due to :    1 .",
    "losses due to absorption and scattering within the medium@xcite .",
    "these losses relate to the finite photon decay time via the uncertainty relation between time and frequency .",
    "imperfect reflection at the mirrors@xcite .",
    "3 .   vibration of mirrors@xcite . if the mirrors vibrate by an amount @xmath31 , the corresponding broadening of the modes is given by , @xmath32 .",
    "in most commercial lasers , the frequency broadening thus produced is of the order of @xmath33 mhz , as sketched in fig.[fig : laser - power - spectrum ] .",
    "typically , @xmath34 , and so the frequency - broadened modes do not overlap each other .",
    "the fourier transform of the electric field will now consist of a series of broadened functions . under the simplifying assumption that all the modes are broadened by the same amount , the electric field fourier transform",
    "can be represented as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a low - pass broadening function of width @xmath37 . because the modes are well separated , the spectral power is @xmath38      the auto - correlation function of a laser is defined as @xmath39 the coherence time of a laser is defined as the time @xmath40 at which the auto - correlation function @xmath41 falls significantly below @xmath24 and the coherence length of a laser is the coherence time scaled by @xmath7 .",
    "it is traditionally assumed that if an interferometer is set up with path length difference greater than the coherence length , the phases of the two waves will be uncorrelated , so no interference pattern will be observed .",
    "however , this standard concept of coherence length is misleading because the phase auto - correlation function is an almost periodic function ; for the purpose of interferometry , it is sufficient to maintain a path length difference corresponding to a maximum of the auto - correlation function .",
    "using@xmath42 eq.[eq : definition - auto - correlation ] can be expressed as @xmath43 using the relation@xmath44 eq.[eq : simplified - auto - correlation - a ] reduces to @xmath45 so @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the normalized spectral power defined by @xmath48 equation [ eq : wiener - khinchin ] is the wiener - khinchin theorem@xcite and shows that the auto - correlation function and the normalized spectral power are fourier transform pairs .",
    "using eq.[eq : laser - electric - field - power - spectrum ] , the auto - correlation function has the dependence @xmath49 let @xmath50 and let @xmath51 be the fourier inverse of @xmath52 so @xmath53 since @xmath52 has a spread of @xmath54 , @xmath51 will have a spread of @xmath55 .    from eq.[eq :",
    "auto - correlation - manipulation - a ] , @xmath56 where @xmath57 each of the complex exponentials in eq.[eq : definition - script - p ] is periodic in @xmath40 , with a period of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 is also periodic with the same period . for @xmath60 , all the components add up constructively and so",
    "@xmath59 will be maximum at these values of @xmath40 .",
    "the exact shape of @xmath59 will depend on the value of the coefficients @xmath61 . for a laser with large number of modes ( corresponding to many non - zero @xmath61 s )",
    ", @xmath59 may have a steep decay away from its peaks .",
    "for a typical laser with @xmath62 cm and @xmath63 mhz , @xmath59 will be periodic with period @xmath64 ns and @xmath51 will have a spread of @xmath65s .",
    "it is convenient to scale time with @xmath7 to express @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 as functions of length .",
    "@xmath69 is thus periodic with period @xmath70 m and @xmath71 decreases with a @xmath72 m scale length .",
    "@xmath73 is thus the product of a slowly decaying envelope function @xmath71 and a periodic function @xmath69 .",
    "the interferometer at caltech operates at @xmath74 m corresponding to the @xmath75 maximum of @xmath69 .",
    "we assume @xmath71 to be gaussian @xmath76 , where @xmath77 the width of @xmath67 , is approximately @xmath72 m. if an interferometer is operated at a path length difference corresponding to a maximum of @xmath69 , the strength of the interference signal will be proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "thus for the caltech interferometer , operating at a path length difference of @xmath78 m causes attenuation of the signal amplitude by a factor @xmath79 . or in other words",
    ", only @xmath80 of power is lost due to unequal path length effects and phase coherence is maintained since @xmath81 has the same value at @xmath78 m as at @xmath82 m.      michelson setup to measure phase auto - correlation of laser .",

    "the envelope magnitude is directly proportional to the phase auto - correlation function.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to test if the laser being used in the caltech interferometer indeed has a periodic auto - correlation function , the laser was used in the michelson interferometer setup shown in fig.[fig : aph24-setup ] .",

    "the difference between successive maxima corresponded to @xmath86 cm .",
    "the amplitude decreased significantly beyond the third maximum because the interferometer became misaligned with large motions of the mirror .",

    "many interferometers , used on existing plasma experiments are two - color interferometers@xcite , that decouple the phase shift caused by the plasma and by mechanical vibrations . because mechanical vibrations are unimportant for the fast time scales(@xmath87 @xmath88s ) of the caltech plasma experiment , a single laser interferometer is adequate .",
    "the interferometer described in fig.[fig : heterodyne ] is set up in a double pass geometry . by interfering beams with large path length difference , it was possible to locate most of the optical components on a small and accessible optical bench(@xmath89 ) .",
    "mirror m4 and the spherical mirror sm are mounted on the vacuum chamber and direct the laser beam through the plasma and back to the optical bench .",
    "the design uses a @xmath23 mw linearly polarized he - ne laser with a cavity length of @xmath4 cm .",
    "an optical isolator is placed in front of the laser to prevent any reflected laser light from entering the laser .",
    "half wave plate hwp1 rotates the polarization vector of the laser beam so that it aligns with the direction of the polarizer at the input of the isolator .",
    "half wave plate hwp2 transforms the beam coming out of the isolator into a vertically polarized beam .",
    "the polarization of the vertically polarized reference beam is unaltered upon reflection from mirrors , beamsplitter or from transmission through the acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "mirror m4 and the spherical mirror sm direct the beam into the vacuum chamber through sapphire windows .",
    "sapphire is a birefringent material , and the windows are oriented to minimize the change in the polarization of the scene beam .",
    "note that the interference signal is maximized if the polarization of the interfering beams is the same .",
    "the aom is oriented so that most of the power of the input reference beam is coupled into the first harmonic .",
    "up to @xmath90 of the input power can be coupled into the first harmonic .",
    "the iris obstructs all other beams except for the first harmonic .",
    "the radius of curvature of the spherical mirror is @xmath23 m , the approximate distance the beam travels from the optical table to the spherical mirror , so the spherical mirror focuses the beam back to almost its original size .",
    "the spherical mirror position is adjusted to ensure that the path length difference between the scene and reference beams is approximately an even multiple of the laser cavity length .",
    "the path length difference is changed in steps of @xmath91 cm . from fig.[fig : laser - aph24-signal ] , it is observed that the laser phase auto - correlation function is flat around the maximas and thus precise adjustment of the path lengths is unnecessary .",
    "once the path length difference is maintained in the proximity of a maxima , the signal amplitude of the interferometer was found to depend more on the alignment of the scene and reference beams than on the precise path length difference of the two beams .",
    "a major advantage of the design shown in fig.[fig : heterodyne ] is the ease of alignment .",
    "the two beams are arranged to overlap each other simply by adjusting the cube beam splitter bs2 , and the mirror m2 .",
    "both these components are located on the optical bench and are easily accessible .",
    "a cube beam splitter was used for combining the beams instead of a plate beam splitter since a cube beam splitter does not introduce any lateral shift in the position of the beam passing through .",

    "figure [ fig : heterodyne - quadrature - signals ] shows the demodulated quadrature signals from a typical plasma shot .",
    "note that when one of the signals is at its maximum or minimum , the other is passing through zero - a consequence of being in quadrature .",

    "can be estimated from the extent to which fig.[fig : heterodyne - quadrature - signals - xy - plot ] resembles a circle .",
    "note that refractive bending intensified the signal amplitude when the plasma intercepts the beam . provided that the beams undergo only a `` small '' displacement because of refractive bending , taking the ratio of the two signals removes the effects of refractive bending on the phase inferred@xcite .    taking the inverse tangent of the ratio of the two quadrature signals yields the phase change caused by the plasma . the plasma density shown in fig.[fig : heterodyne - density - signal ]",
    "was estimated from the phase change using @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the phase shift induced by the plasma , @xmath96 is the mass of electron , @xmath97 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath98 is the electron charge , @xmath84 is the length of plasma the laser beam traverses , and @xmath20 nm is the he - ne laser wavelength . from fig.[fig : heterodyne - density - signal ] it is observed that the mechanical vibrations have changed the phase by @xmath99 in @xmath100 , while the plasma has induced a phase change of @xmath101 and back in @xmath102 .",
    "thus the mechanical vibrations have negligible effect on inferred plasma density , and can even be filtered out during post processing of data .",
    "line - densities of the order of @xmath103 were observed in the experiment .",
    "assuming a double pass plasma length @xmath104 cm , as shown in fig.[fig : imacon ] , corresponds to average densities of @xmath105 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the density inferred by fitting the stark broadened @xmath106 spectral line profile to a lorentzian@xcite .",
    "the signal to noise performance of interferometers is specified in terms of the phase ambiguity of the signals .",
    "the phase ambiguity is given by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the rms error in the signal and @xmath109 is the strength of the signal@xcite .",
    "for typical data this was found to be @xmath110 , corresponding to a line - density error of @xmath111 .",
    "a he - ne heterodyne interferometer was developed for the caltech spheromak formation experiment .",
    "the design is especially suited for fast plasma experiments with time scales much smaller than the time scales of mechanical vibrations of the mirrors .",
    "the interferometer operates well even though there is a path length difference of @xmath5 m between the scene and the reference beams .",
    "operating at such a large path length difference considerably reduced the number of optical components and difficulties in alignment .",
    "the laser beams in a two - color interferometer may have different periods for their phase auto - correlation function .",
    "thus operating at large path length differences in a two - color interferometer may require some non - trivial modifications to existing setups .",
    "however , for two - color interferometers with lasers having the same cavity length , or using a single laser@xcite , the path length of the reference beam could be adjusted straightforwardly .",
