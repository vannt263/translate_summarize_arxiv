    "was the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) deployed on board the compton gamma - ray observatory from 1991 - 2002 that kept a continuous monitor of the entire sky in the gamma - ray band , discovering over 2000 gamma - ray bursts and the phenomena now known as terrestrial gamma flashes ( tgfs ) .",

    "( the term  cadence \" here will be taken to mean the average frequency of return to image the same field . )",
    "this paper is therefore an attempt to begin a discussion of an attribute common to many sky - monitoring surveys  a desire to maximize the number of transients discovered . in section 2",
    "some background will be given discussing common to many sky - monitoring telescopes .",
    "section 3 will discuss maximizing quiescents while section 4 will discuss some general principles of monitoring for transients including the case of transients where the luminosity distribution is described by a power law near and well below the survey limiting magnitude .",
    "section 6 will give some concluding discussion .",
    "a telescope will detect a source only if its signal peaks above the noise . for a source of apparent luminosity @xmath0 ( here  apparent luminosity \" is used synonymously with  flux \" ) , the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath1 during a single observation can be described by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the duration of the exposure , @xmath4 is the equivalent apparent luminosity of the background skyglow that accumulates with exposure time ( for a good discussion of detection rates in the face of backgrounds , see , for example , @xcite ) , @xmath5 is a constant background term not affected by exposure time , for instance read - noise , and @xmath6 is a site , time , telescope , and sky position dependent amplitude for scintillation noise ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .    given a fixed @xmath1 threshold , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 at the source detection limit , equation ( [ sn ] ) can be inverted to solve for @xmath7 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the type of noise that dominates observations divides important regimes in this function .",
    "although the relation is expressible analytically , it will be convenient to write it as a single power law such that @xmath8 in a common case where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are small , @xmath9 can be found instantaneously at any @xmath7 such that @xmath10 now if the background skyglow level @xmath4 is small compared to @xmath7 , @xmath9 tends toward @xmath11 so that @xmath12 .",
    "the other extreme case is when background skyglow @xmath4 is high compared to @xmath7 , so that the @xmath4 term dominates , @xmath9 tends toward @xmath13 , and so @xmath14 .",
    "a frequent assumption used in these analyses will be that that the effective cumulative apparent luminosity distribution of sources (  log n - log s \" , hereafter just referred to as  brightness distribution \" ) is a power law such that the number of interesting objects accumulated during a single exposure of duration @xmath3 would be simply @xmath15 .",
    "non - power law brightness distributions can frequently be approximated by a power law at ( and below ) the apparent luminosity cut - off @xmath7 , an approximation that makes the following discussion particularly relevant to realistic programs .    at the limit of observation",
    ", sources may be so numerous that their point spread functions begin to significantly overlap .",
    "when this happens , source confusion will create a practical limit on the faintest source detectable . in practice",
    ", source confusion can be incorporated into the above formalism by allowing it to change the brightness distribution @xmath16 for the given object type , telescope , and sky survey .",
    "in fact , since @xmath16 is an _ effective _ distribution , a host of practical limitations can be incorporated into it .",
    "although this paper is primarily interested in transients , it is relevant and instructive to analyze the simpler case of quiescent sources first .",
    "a canonical telescope and camera is assumed , with a given field of view of solid angle @xmath17 , and limiting apparent luminosity @xmath7 observable over the telescopes bandpass .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the number of observable quiescent sources that would be visible in a single field to limiting apparent luminosity @xmath7 , found during an exposure of effective duration @xmath3 would be @xmath18 where @xmath19 is redshift , @xmath20 is absolute luminosity ( also sometimes known as intrinsic luminosity or just  luminosity \" , although it may be normalized ) , @xmath21 is the luminosity function of candidate quiescent sources , @xmath22 is the k- correction for the telescope bandpass , @xmath23 , @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath24 is the hubble parameter , @xmath25 is angular diameter distance , @xmath26 is the energy density of the universe in matter in units of the critical energy density , @xmath27 is the energy density due to the curvature of space , and @xmath28 is the energy density due to the cosmological constant .",
    "the integrand @xmath29 can be computed from @xmath7 and @xmath19 from @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents luminosity distance .",
    "a perhaps familiar case is that of detecting quiescents in fields of such low background that poisson noise dominates the counting statistics .",
    "this will be referred to as the  low background \" case .",
    "given a canonical telescope and set amount of time @xmath32 for an observing campaign , should this time be divided tiling all available fields , or spent staring at a limited number of fields ?",
    "it will be assumed here that data taken from the same parts of the sky can be efficiently co - added .    to make matters simple",
    ", it will be assumed that the brightness distribution can be simplified from equation ( [ nqint ] ) to @xmath33 . from equation ( [ tebeta ] )",
    "@xmath34 so that equation ( [ nqint ] ) simplifies to @xmath35 studying this simple equation will give significant insight into the  tile \" or  stare \" question . to calibrate intuition , let s consider the case of @xmath36 , so that the number of detected sources is just linear with the exposure time .",
    "an example case is when the background is low , @xmath37 , and so @xmath38 . assuming it takes little time to slew to a new field",
    ", it then does not matter if one stares at the same location , or tiles the sky : the same number of long duration ( and hence quiescent ) transients will be detected . here",
    "the answer to  tile or stare \" is a formal tie .",
    "if the power - law index @xmath39 is less than unity , however , equation ( [ nqpoisson ] ) indicates that  tile \" will detect more sources per unit exposure time than  stare \" .",
    "this is because , when staring at a single field , new sources are appearing over the limiting brightness horizon at an increasingly slower rate .",
    "higher rates are found by starting over on a new field . given a total observing campaign time ,",
    "the most sources will be found by dividing the time equally between all the available fields .",
    "similarly , if the power - law index @xmath39 of equation ( [ nqpoisson ] ) is greater than unity , `` stare '' will detect more sources per unit exposure time than  tile \" .",
    "this is because , when staring at a single field , new sources are pouring over the limiting brightness horizon at an increasingly fast rate .",
    "lower rates would be found by starting over on a new field .",
    "therefore , in general , given a total observing campaign time , the most sources will be found by staring at one field .    stated differently , two identical observations of statistically identical fields should yield twice the number of sources than in a single field . for a steep brightness distribution where @xmath40 , however , spending twice the time on the first field will detect _ more _ than twice the number of sources .",
    "so  stare \" is preferred to maximize sources observed or monitored .",
    "can @xmath41 ?",
    "since the brightness distribution @xmath42 is a cumulative distribution , it can not decrease , an equivalent statement to not having @xmath41 over any part of its length .    for non - power law brightness distributions ,",
    "the situation is a more complex .",
    "cases likely include where the luminosity function is not a power law ( @xmath43 changes ) and cases where noise terms are not constant over the course of observations ( @xmath9 changes ) . for @xmath39 decreasing monotonically with increasing @xmath3 in identical fields",
    ", one should always observe in the field where the rate of source accumulation is instantaneously highest .",
    "therefore , one should stare at one field only until the rate of source accumulation falls below that in a fresh field .",
    "this is certainly true when @xmath39 falls through unity , although the transition will likely occur in many cases when @xmath39 is still in excess of unity .",
    "note that the tile / stare divide for brightness distributions well - characterized by a power - law @xmath43 is @xmath44 which depends on the level of the background at the limiting apparent luminosity of the single field exposure @xmath7 .",
    "when sky flux @xmath4 is negligible , a case here referred to as  low background \" , equation ( [ beta ] ) indicates that @xmath45 so that the divide in terms of the brightness distribution comes at @xmath46 . when the sky flux dominates , a case here referred to as  high background \" , then @xmath47 so that the divide in terms the brightness distribution comes at @xmath48 .",
    "in general , the critical brightness distribution power - law index at the tile / stare divide is @xmath49 when @xmath50 , tiling will optimize source counts , otherwise staring will optimize source counts .",
    "the longer an instrument observes a particular field , the fainter the source detectable at the limiting apparent luminosity ( @xmath7 decreases ) , the smaller the limiting source brightness will be compared to the background sky brightness .",
    "stated differently , even if a field observation started at  low background \" , it naturally migrates toward  high background \" as exposures lengthen .",
    "this means that for long exposures , @xmath9 naturally migrates toward higher values , so that @xmath51 will migrate toward a lower value .",
    "therefore , a switch from  stare \" to  tile \" might become advantageous even were the brightness distribution power - law @xmath43 to remain constant .    for non - power law ,",
    "non - monotonically decreasing brightness distributions , maximizing source counts becomes similar to a chess game .",
    "fields that start with low source accumulation rates might ramp up quickly at a later time , when , for example , a cluster might become resolved . therefore ,",
    "choosing which field to image next and for how long in order to maximize source counts might require a complex monte - carlo program , possibly one that operates in real time including topical information about how seeing and weather affect the ( effective apparent ) brightness distributions in fields across the sky .",
    "in this paper a practical distinction will be made between quiescent sources and long duration transients . here , increasingly faint quiescent sources can be detected by co - adding images of the same part of the sky at any time , whereas transients will need to be detected on a single exposure or co - added time - consecutive series of sky exposures . for transients of any duration , the fleeting nature of the source makes the  tile \" or  stare \" question more complicated when trying to maximize the discovery rate .",
    "if telescope fields are easily aligned and relevant data are easily available , it will be possible to discover transients on time - separated exposures , possibly by co - adding frames taken at different times during the transient . for simplicity ,",
    "however , only the relatively standard paradigm of discovering transience in a time - contiguous series of exposures will be considered here .",
    "discovering a transient with a single exposure is particularly susceptible to false triggers by non - astronomical phenomena .",
    "transience verification is usually necessary for a practical sky - monitoring algorithm .",
    "false triggers are usually a single - frame phenomenon , however , and reality verification can be built into a time - contiguous series of exposures .",
    "when these check observations occur time - contiguous with the initial observation , together they can be considered as part what is necessary for transient  discovery . \"    given that ",
    "tile \" is desired , the tiling cadence should of course be chosen for what science return is expected .",
    "in general , a  discovery cadence \" will be distinguished from a  tracking cadence . \"",
    "discovery cadence , for example , should maximize the number of transients discovered .",
    "tracking cadence , however , should maximize the scientific return from a single transient .",
    "it is possible  even likely  that a non - uniform cadence would better address both discovery and tracking for those monitors not reporting triggers to follow - up instruments . however , unless explicitly stated , uniform cadence rates will be assumed in this paper .",
    "in addition , in this paper an attempt will be made to maximize the number of discovered transient objects , expecting that important transient event will be handed off ( in a timely fashion ) to a telescope dedicated to following them up specifically .    the way the apparent brightness distribution is defined for quiescents and transients might differ . in particular , @xmath7 for a transient used in equation ( [ ntint ] )",
    "can be defined a number of ways .",
    "useful definitions include @xmath7 as the apparent luminosity during a quiescent phase , as the apparent luminosity at the peak of an outburst , or as the average apparent luminosity over a given duration .",
    "given a corresponding distance , apparent luminosity @xmath0 and absolute luminosity @xmath20 can be directly related .",
    "each transient will have amplitude @xmath52 , which can run from less than unity ( sources become dimmer , such as during a planetary transit ) to greater than unity .",
    "for explosive sources , of course , the @xmath52 is expected to be much greater than unity .",
    "transients will have an amplitude probability density such that the probability of a transient of absolute luminosity @xmath20 and redshift @xmath19 having an amplitude between @xmath52 and @xmath53 at any time is given by @xmath54 .",
    "for each @xmath20 and @xmath19 this probability is normalized to unity so that @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , each transient will have a duration of @xmath56 .",
    "transients will have a duration probability density such that the probability of a transient of absolute luminosity @xmath20 and redshift @xmath19 having an duration between @xmath57 and @xmath58 at any time is given by @xmath59 .",
    "this probability is also normalized to unity so that @xmath60 .",
    "it is assumed here that all @xmath61 , so that these terms do not appear explicitly in the following analyses .    including these factors",
    ", the number of transients detected in a single field down to limiting apparent luminosity @xmath7 in a single exposure ( or a single consecutive series of exposures ) of ( total ) duration @xmath3 would be @xmath62 here @xmath63 is _ not _ a rate ",

    "the sky is considered to be static in the sense that extending @xmath3 will not increase the number of bright transients , but allow more faint transients ( visible during the entire exposure ) to come over the detection threshold . in this light , @xmath64 is also _ not _ a rate and describes the space density of transients that happen to be observable at absolute luminosity @xmath20 and redshift @xmath19 when integrated over the entire length of the exposure .",
    "although @xmath3 does not appear explicitly in equation ( [ n1tint ] ) , it will enter later through @xmath7 .",
    "equation ( [ n1tint ] ) has two realizations involving @xmath29 , the minimum absolute luminosity of a transient that is seen at the apparent detection threshold @xmath7 .",
    "when known quiescent sources are being inspected for transience , @xmath29 is determined as it was below equation ( [ nqint ] ) .",
    "it is possible , however , that transient sources will be detected _ only _ because they show transience .",
    "this might happen , for example , were a quiescent source originally below the detection threshold of the telescope to experience a high amplitude event that brought it above the detection threshold .",
    "this would affect the minimum absolute luminosity in equation ( [ ntint ] ) such that @xmath65 .",
    "an example of this type of transient detection is pixel lensing @xcite .",
    "when re - inspecting a given field for transience , the probability of finding new transience may have changed .",
    "suppose , for example , that the same field is inspected twice for transience , one time shortly after the other .",
    "the two exposures are not co - added . given that the exposure time @xmath3 is the same for each field but significantly less than transient duration @xmath56 , the likelihood of finding _ new _ transients in the second exposure is likely reduced .",
    "this is because there has only been a short time during which a new transient could have gone off .    more generally ,",
    "if @xmath66 is the number of transients discovered in the first field exposure , and the same field is inspected for an equal exposure time @xmath3 after time @xmath67 , then @xmath68 , the number of transients discovered in the second exposure is related to @xmath66 by @xmath69 it is assumed that the transient rate remains constant in each region of space . note that as @xmath67 becomes small , so does the number of new transients discovered . when @xmath67 becomes larger than @xmath56 , then @xmath70 so that field has effectively been  reset \" and all discovered episodes of transience at duration @xmath56 are again new .",
    "the number of new transients discovered in a previously observed field is therefore given by @xmath71    equation ( [ ntint ] ) has realizations that are quite complicated .",
    "as with the general quiescent case , for non - power law , non - monotonically decreasing transient brightness distributions , maximizing source counts becomes similar to a chess game .",
    "choosing which field to image next and for how long in order to maximize discovered transients might require a complex monte - carlo program , possibly one that operates in real time including topical information about how seeing and weather affect the apparent brightness distributions in fields across the sky .",
    "significant insight can be gleaned , however , from studying relatively simpler theoretical regimes .      in the cases considered here , fields are identical , noise sources are unique and unchanging over observations of interest ( @xmath9 is a constant ) , and the effective apparent brightness distribution is a single power law over its entire length ( @xmath43 is a constant ) . additionally , it will be assumed that transients attain amplitude greater than @xmath52 for duration @xmath56 .",

    "note that this @xmath9 is between the above discussed cases of low and high background , so that when the background is low , @xmath45 , and staring is the best strategy .",
    "alternatively , when the background is high , @xmath47 , so that tiling wins .",
    "since quiescents can be discovered in frames co - added at any delay , the exact tiling rate is not important , and so can be set to minimize the total slew time , for example .",
    "a tiling campaign should best proceed by dividing the time equally between observable identical fields , with fields having the least exposure time getting the highest priority .",
    "suppose now that the above uniform , isotropic sources are transients with duration @xmath56 and characteristic apparent luminosity @xmath0 .",
    "all transients will be assumed to have the same duration .",
    "the fraction of sources that show transience at any one time will turn out to be unimportant for optimization . again consider the search a campaign of time @xmath32 on a given telescope .    here",
    ", again , the  tile \" or  stare \" decision depends on the predominant source of noise . again  stare \" will be preferred when @xmath40 , equivalent to @xmath115 since @xmath105 . in the quiescent case ,",
    "cadence was not important since sources could be discovered on fields co - added with any time delay . here the finite duration of transience will indicate a best cadence .",
    "suppose first that @xmath89 .",
    "equation ( [ ng ] ) indicates that @xmath91 increases monotonically with @xmath3 , pushing us into the regime where @xmath94 .",
    "equation ( [ ng ] ) , however , has @xmath91 _ decreasing _ monotonically with @xmath3 at large @xmath3 .",
    "equation ( [ treturn ] ) then gives @xmath116 .",
    "the best cadence is seen to be @xmath56 for small down and slew times .",
    "the supermacho project inspects the lmc for microlensing @xcite .",
    "the lmc , however , shows an anisotropic and non - uniform sky distribution , indicating that the above detailed cadence calculations made for isotropic , uniform distributions are of mainly didactic value .",
    "an analysis of the supermacho observing algorithm is given by @xcite . according to their web page",
    ", supermacho employs 60 fields each having @xmath117 deg@xmath118 .",
    "the web page also indicates a canonical magnitude limit of around @xmath119 .",
    "it will be assumed that high background dominates the noise in any exposure , so that @xmath120 .    according to figure 4 of @xcite , a canonical lmc field ( field 13 in their work ) has a cumulative luminosity function where @xmath121 from visual magnitude 20 to visual magnitude 22 , and @xmath122 from visual magnitude 22 to visual magnitude 24 .",
    "a combined average power - law index from 20 to 24 is about @xmath123 .",
    "since the lmc stars are all at approximately the same distance , the cumulative luminosity function will be the effective cumulative apparent brightness distribution .",
    "therefore , since @xmath50 , the above analysis indicates that  tile \" will discover more transients than  stare . \"",
    "now a canonical duration of a microlensing event is about one month . to obtain good coverage , however",
    ", one might want to record the event on the rise , so a duration of interest is about two weeks . since @xmath75 and @xmath76 are on the order of seconds , it will be assumed that they are negligible compared to @xmath124 and @xmath3 .",
    "the above analysis then indicates that for each field , the optimal @xmath67 time is @xmath56 .",
    "this indicates that supermacho should return to each field after two weeks .",
    "the supermacho web page notes , however , that each field is returned to twice a night ,  in order to maximize the number of stars inspected for microlensing . \" given that each star has a constant probability of being microlensed , the above quoted maximization scheme of maximizing stars would also maximize the transients discovered .",
    "therefore , how can these two cadences be consistent ?    one reason may be that the effective cumulative apparent luminosity distribution ( @xmath63 ) of lmc transients is dropping rapidly after a given exposure time ( c. stubbs 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "the optimized cadence of two weeks assumed that a constant @xmath39 continued indefinitely .",
    "now since each lmc supermacho field is different , @xmath91 is likely different for each field .",
    "as indicated above , for complex cases like these , a real - time monte - carlo routine might be run planning each night s observing campaign based on present and predicted sky conditions that could best maximize @xmath91 for that night .",
    "suppose one wants to maximize the number of type ia supernovae discovered with the planned large - aperture synoptic survey telescope @xcite .",
    "according to modeling in a simple cold dark matter universe by @xcite , the integral number count rate of these transients is approximately @xmath125 for @xmath126 , while @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "now the lsst web page states a design goal of magnitude 24 in a single 10 second exposure over 7 deg@xmath118 , with a readout time is estimated to be about 5 seconds .",
    "further suppose that lsst can tile 25% of the sky per night ( @xmath129 steradians ; @xmath130 10,000 deg@xmath118 ) .",
    "this indicates that on a clear moonless night that @xmath131 , lsst can point to about @xmath132 independent fields .",
    "a supernova might be perceived to have the most value if caught on the rising part of its light curve , which has duration of about @xmath133 days .",
    "this case is simpler than the supermacho / microlensing case since type ia supernovae can be assumed distributed isotropically in the universe .",
    "also , supernovae should not crowd each other on the sky , so that we would not expect source confusion to flatten the effective brightness distribution .    at brighter magnitudes ,",
    "the steep @xmath48 brightness distribution would place @xmath40 for any @xmath9 , indicating that lsst should stare at any field until the brightness distribution breaks . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the shallow @xmath43 indicates that @xmath113 for any @xmath9 , indicating that lsst should tile in this regime .    given that @xmath39 is indeed a constant in this regime",
    ", the analysis given above in section 4 can determine the most productive cadence . assuming the down and slew times are small",
    ", the cadence should be the duration of the interesting part of the transient : 15 days for a low - redshift supernova .",
    "given 1400 fields and a 25 percent duty cycle due to the sun and moon , the best exposure time comes out to be about 230 seconds .",
    "shorter exposures would lead to returning to a field too rapidly and hence re - discovering known supernovae , while longer exposures would miss supernovae occurring elsewhere .    if it is found that @xmath39 flattens significantly , tiling will still be preferred , but a shorter cadence than the transient duration may be needed to avoid observing in increasingly barren fields .",
    "the actual cadence would need to be found by noting the new transient accumulation rate in a fresh field , and switching to a new field when the rate drops below that in an old field .",
    "the above cadence would _ only _ be valuable for maximizing local supernova detections during the rise .",
    "lsst has several other proposed scientific uses , however .",
    "once could length the cadence to optimize for supernovae at higher redshifts . in this light ,",
    "an lsst guest investigator program might be of valuable .",
    "in such a program , scientists outside the lsst collaboration might be invited to propose different cadence rates and/or bandpasses so as to optimize the detections of sources of different types and/or transients of different durations .",
    "the gamma ray large area telescope ( glast ; see , for example , @xcite ) will surely sample more faint blazers and flares from blazars than ever before in the energy ranges from 10 mev to 100 gev .",
    "the question has come up , however , as to the most productive algorithm for pointing glast ( j. bonnell 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the telescope has a planned constraint of pointing away from the earth , so that if the zenith angle of the telescope is not changed , glast will re - observe the same part of the sky every 90 minutes . what zenith angle rocking algorithm would best maximize the discovery of blazars and blazar flares ?    from inspection of @xcite figure 2 , the power - law slope of the cumulative approximated brightness distribution for quiescent blazars is expected to be about @xmath134 below integrated flux in ( @xmath135 100 mev photons ) of @xmath136 @xmath137 sec@xmath138 . for flaring blazars",
    ", this same power - law slope is about @xmath139 .",
    "these estimations are extrapolated from results from the egret instrument that flew on the compton gamma ray observatory @xcite .",
    "now glast s field of view is about two steradians , and the likely point spread function of sources is expected to be highly energy dependent .",
    "the below analysis will assume that no matter the energy , sources will not significantly overlap , so that source confusion will not significantly flatten the brightness distribution . the energy range for which this will be true may need to be determined by actual glast observations , but it is assumed valid here through most of the glast energy band",
    ".    first addressed here will be the question of maximizing the number of quiescent blazars discovered .",
    "it will be assumed that the background in the gamma - ray range of glast is dominated by poisson noise everywhere but in the plane of the galaxy , a relatively small angular region .",
    "the exact boundaries of this region , too , will be energy dependent .",
    "given that @xmath40 in this region ,  stare \" mode is to be preferred in maximizing the discovery of new blazars .",
    "this could mean that some zenith angles should be relatively ignored since time is better spent re - observing previously observed fields .",
    "alternatively , a  glast deep field \" ( gdf ) might be created where a significant amount of observing time is spent accumulating the relative abundance of dim blazars .",
    "it is possible , even probable , that @xmath39 is not constant and will flatten significantly for the dimmer quiescents .",
    "in fact , @xmath39 may dip below unity for different exposure times at different galactic latitudes and for different energies .",
    "when this happens , tiling becomes preferred , and gdfs become inefficient in discovering new blazars .",
    "the most efficient tiling algorithm might need to await determination of the actual brightness distribution for the fields of interest by glast itself .",
    "next addressed here will be the question of maximizing the number of transient blazar flares discovered . for flares , since @xmath107 , only in the lowest noise regimes can @xmath140 . in regions of the sky where the noise is entirely dominated by poisson , the case is a formal tie so that it does not matter where in these regions glast points . for everywhere else , however , @xmath113 and so some sort of tiling algorithm will maximize the number of flares discovered .    for regions where tiling is to be preferred , we now address the question of the optimal cadence . here",
    "the situation is complicated by several factors .",
    "the first is that different regions of the ( direction , energy , exposure duration ) matrix will be best characterized by a different @xmath39 .",
    "the above analyses in section 4 assumed a constant @xmath39 , so that it can only be rigorously applied to similar regions .",
    "as indicated above , to determine if it is beneficial to jump to a region of different @xmath39 , one should determine whether the rate of new transients discovered in the old field has dropped below that rate in a fresh field .    for regions of similar @xmath39 , given that down and",
    "slew times are negligible , the above analyses indicate that the optimal cadence is the duration of interest in the blazar flare",
    ". the total duration of blazar flares can be from hours to weeks .",
    "the duration of interest may be shorter than this , however , if blazar flares will need to be discovered relatively early on , so that instruments in other bands can be triggered to monitor the event during the flare .    here the cadence can be used as tool to isolate blazar flares of a given duration ",
    "faster cadences will isolate faster flares .",
    "to best discover the fastest blazar flares , glast might be put into a mode in which it changes its zenith angle rapidly , effectively sampling the entire sky every few hours .",
    "a caveat occurs for fields away from the spin poles of the earth .",
    "there a cadence of less than 90 minutes is not possible for fields since this is less than the revolution time of glast around the earth .",
    "this paper is not meant to be the final word in the determination of pointing algorithms for telescope monitors . indeed , pointing algorithms will likely need to incorporate more practical considerations that are not formally considered here .",
    "first , as mentioned above , given a plethora of potential noise sources that include cosmic ray hits and satellite glints , it is clearly not assured that any single - frame transient is of astronomical importance .",
    "verification observations can and should be built into observing algorithms to assure that triggered transients have a reasonable chance of being of astronomical interest .",
    "when these check observations occur time - contiguous with the initial observation , together they can be considered as part what is necessary for transient  discovery . \"    next , the idiosyncrasies of different telescopes , observing sites , ccds , control hardware , control software and observers themselves can also have a large and even deterministic effect on the design and implementation of a practical observing algorithm .",
    "an example of this could be the inability for a telescope to slew faster than a certain rate , the need to dither successive observations to minimize pixel inequities , or the occurrence of certain fields at certain times in areas above cities that create relatively bright sky - glow .",
    "next , the idiosyncrasies of different transient types can drive practical observing algorithms .",
    "some transients might only be found only in certain sections of the sky or superposed on certain types of backgrounds that create specific observing challenges .",
    "an example of this is supernova searches , where the transient frequently occurs superposed on its host galaxy .",
    "although potentially difficult , this information could be included in the _ effective _ @xmath141 function .",
    "next , the goal of transient observing might not be to discover the maximum raw number of transients but the most transients with a certain attribute .",
    "an example of this might be an effort to find particularly bright cases of microlensing @xcite or planet transits @xcite . in these cases , observing deeper would not help discover brighter sources . here",
    "the above formalism might be augmented with a weighting function emphasizing sources in the desired magnitude range . again , alternatively , the effective @xmath141 could be adapted to incorporate this information , for example not counting transients too dim to be of interest .",
    "next , it might be preferred that transients _ not _ be detected in a single exposure or time - contiguous series of exposures , as , for example , discussed in @xcite",
    ". this would greatly affect the discussion given above .",
    "in fact , the drive toward separating observing times by the transient duration is fueled by the single exposure premise .",
    "if frames can be routinely aligned and co - added then one can spread the detection observations out over @xmath56 with any distribution at all , only demanding that enough observations be carried out during @xmath56 so that transient detection is assured .",
    "next , transients do not all have the same durations . optimizing for a single duration might indeed cause an observing algorithm to miss transients of shorter duration .",
    "robust observing algorithms attacking a distribution of durations might try to optimize toward the peak of the duration distribution , or use the above analysis as the basis for a more sophisticated one that optimizes transient discovery rates over the entire distribution of durations .    nevertheless , even given all of these caveats , transient detection algorithms need to be determined more by hard logic and mathematical optimization than by whim .",
    "a map of how effective @xmath39 changes with the accumulated exposure time in each field might indeed be useful in matching cadence with scientific return . at minimum ,",
    "key pieces of information that should be considered include the duration and the brightness distributions of the transients .",
    "an example of how they interact in a relative clean set of theoretical but didactic cases is given above .",
    "even a valiant effort to predetermine a cadence that optimizes discovery rates might fail , given inaccurate knowledge of relevant parameters such as the duration distribution function .",
    "therefore , a pointing algorithm might deploy  cadence creep \" ( m. kowalski 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "the idea is to slightly change cadence over time to see if transient detection rates increase . to be effective",
    ", enough transients would have to be detected for a statistically meaningful comparison . a search phase for an optimal cadence , between estimated boundaries ,",
    "might be mandated as an early phase of a transient search program .",
    "a natural extension of the idea that different observing algorithms optimize different scientific return is the implementation of a diverse array of observing algorithms on any given sky monitoring telescope .",
    "guest investigator programs might diversify previously dedicated sky monitoring telescopes by implementing bandpasses and cadences chosen to optimize the discovery of different types of transients .",
    "last , the decision to  tile \" or  stare \" and how fast to tile are influenced by more than the ability to discover the maximum amounts of sources and/or transients .",
    "the schema discussed above implicitly assumed that other telescopes can be deployed for follow - up observations , and that these follow - up telescopes will maximize the science uncovered per transient . if follow - up time is not expected for discovered transients , one may want to code follow - up observations directly into the timing of the observations . for this reason ,",
    "a non - uniform cadence , one that combines attributes of both discovery and tracking , such as returning to sources in logarithmically increasing time intervals , might be preferable .",
