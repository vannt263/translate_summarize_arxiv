    "van der waals and casimir - polder potentials are the dominant interactions between charge - neutral objects at nano- to micrometer length scales . as such",
    "they have attracted considerable interest in the field of microtechnology , as well as the field of quantum - gravity , where some theories predict deviations from newtonian potentials at very short length scales @xcite .",
    "the dependence of these potentials on the geometry and dielectric function of surfaces is only partially understood . in the present paper",
    "we report measurements of sufficient precision to study these effects .    over the past decade ,",
    "van der waals ( vdw ) potentials between atoms and surfaces have been measured using diffraction from nano - fabricated gratings @xcite , quantum reflection from surfaces @xcite , and spectroscopy of cs atoms in nano - cells @xcite .",
    "the most accurate of these reported an uncertainty of 15% @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the vdw potential strength ( @xmath0 ) for na atoms and a silicon - nitride ( sin@xmath1 ) surface with a precision of @xmath3 by studying diffraction of an atom beam from a nano - grating .",
    "we applied this improved precision to show that we can detect a change in @xmath0 due to a thin layer of metal deposited on the grating .",
    "in addition we will discuss the effect of edges on the atom - surface potential and we will discuss some of the difficulties in calculating the vdw potential for real systems .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in @xmath0 in previous diffraction experiments was imprecise knowledge of the grating s geometric parameters .",
    "@xcite reported an uncertainty in @xmath0 of 25% due to an uncertainty in the window width ( @xmath4 ) of only 1 nm ( when @xmath4= 50 nm ) .",
    "this correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is the main problem that we have overcome by finding the `` magic '' open - fraction .",
    "we can now measure @xmath0 independently of @xmath4 .",
    "perreault _ et al .",
    "_ determined @xmath4 by sem imaging ; conventional imaging techniques however can not easily improve these measurements .",
    "sem/ tem imaging is hindered by charging and image charge effects , while stm / afm images show a convolution of the sample and the unknown tip shape .",
    "the experiment described in this paper allows us to determine the geometric parameters in addition to @xmath0 .     a schematic representation of the grating geometry .",
    "the grating bars have a trapezoidal cross - section , with a wedge angle @xmath5 .",
    "the grating can be rotated around an axis parallel to the grating bars ( @xmath6 ) by an angle @xmath7 .",
    "the period of the grating ( @xmath8 ) is 100 nm .",
    "the width of the grating windows ( @xmath4 ) varies for different gratings between 40 and 70 nm .",
    "the thickness of the bars ( @xmath9 ) is about 120 nm . @xmath10 is the projected widow width.,width=321 ]    the reason it was difficult to determine either @xmath0 or @xmath4 from a study of diffraction alone is that the effect of a small increase in @xmath0 is usually very similar to the effect of a small decrease in the window width . in this paper",
    "we explain the origin of this correlation and we will show how the correlation disappears for certain special values of the open - fraction @xmath11 .",
    "gratings with this magic open - fraction enable us to determine @xmath0 and @xmath4 independently from each other , thus eliminating the effect that limited the precision of previous experiments .",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated this by repeatedly coating a grating with metal until the desired @xmath12 was reached ( section ii ) . in the study of atom - surface interactions however , it is undesirable to contaminate the surface .",
    "we therefore developed a similar method wherein the grating is rotated by an angle , @xmath13 , to change the projected open - fraction such that the @xmath0 - @xmath4 correlation vanishes ( section iii ) .",
    "our experimental setup is described elsewhere @xcite . in brief",
    ", we used a supersonic beam of na atoms incident on a sin@xmath1 material grating with a period of @xmath14 nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr_dr ] ) .",
    "we measured the flux of diffracted atoms as a function of position by translating a hot - wire detector in the transverse direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : raw_data ] ) .",
    "we then did a least squares fit of these data to determine the diffraction order intensities ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we measured @xmath15 at different grating rotation angles @xmath7 , as a function of velocity , ranging from 1000 to 3000 m / s . in the analysis we used only the ratio",
    "@xmath16 vs velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coating_i2i3 ] ) to determine both @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "we choose to focus on these two orders because they are more sensitive to @xmath0 than the 0th and 1st orders and more easily detectable than higher orders . studying the ratio",
    "reduces systematic errors associated with detector non - linearity and the beam - profile used to fit the diffraction data . when measuring diffraction intensities as a function of grating rotation , we recorded a complete diffraction pattern for each rotation angle , thus taking into account the change in separation of the orders due to foreshortening of the grating period ; this was ignored in previous work by cronin _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "given the typical grating geometry , we know all atoms must pass within 30 nm of a surface .",
    "we are therefore sensitive exclusively to the short range non - retarded vdw potential .",
    "we used the model described in reference @xcite to fit the diffraction intensities .",
    "the potential was approximated by that of two surfaces of infinite extent , co - located with the two inside surfaces of a grating window .",
    "the potential of one such a surface is well known to have the form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the distance from the atom to the surface .",
    "this potential was then assumed to be ` on ' only for a distance @xmath9 while the atom is between the grating bars . in the wkb approximation ,",

    "the intensity of the far - field diffraction orders can now be calculated using techniques from fourier optics .",
    "is shown as a function of velocity for grating g1 at normal incidence .",
    "measurements were made after repeated coating with au / pd .",
    "the curves indicate three least squares fits to the data.,width=321 ]",
    "the question of whether there is an optimal nano - grating geometry to use in diffraction experiments has been a topic of informal conversation for some time @xcite .",
    "we will show that there is indeed a `` magic '' open - fraction that improves the precision of @xmath0 measurements by a factor of 5 .",
    "the vdw - induced phase has curvature , just as would be the case for the phase acquired by light due to a lens .",
    "thus we see that the vdw potential causes atoms to be deflected into higher orders .",
    "similarly , a grating with a smaller window width would lead to more intensity in the higher orders relative to the zeroth order .",
    "it is tempting to try to approximate the effect of the vdw potential by a simple diffraction model that uses @xmath22 and a modified window width @xmath23    this approximation has become the matter of textbooks @xcite , and it illustrates how a measurement of the vdw potential can not be made unless the window width is well known .",
    "we derive an expression for @xmath24 in appendix a.    the fact that we can make such an approximation explains the correlation between the fit - parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine whether or not this approximation holds for all @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "we recall that diffraction from a binary amplitude mask produces zero intensity in the @xmath25-th order when the open - fraction @xmath26 .",
    "however , cronin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated that , in the presence of the vdw potential , diffraction from material gratings will never produce a diffraction order with zero intensity .",
    "we therefore expect that there exists a particular magic open - fraction where the approximation in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : approx ] ) breaks down .",
    "we expect this to occur when the effective open - fraction approaches an integer fraction , i.e. @xmath27 in appendix a we derive an expression for @xmath28 and we show that the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 indeed vanishes as @xmath29 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we first use simulated data to investigate what happens to the fit - parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 when @xmath30 .",
    "we simulated @xmath16 vs velocity ( similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : coating_i2i3 ] ) for several grating geometries and fitted the simulated data with our model .",
    "figure [ fig : chisq_simdata ] shows a contour - plot of the @xmath31-surface in @xmath0 - @xmath4 space for several different values of @xmath4 . for most values of @xmath4 these contours describe extended valleys , making it impossible to determine either parameter uniquely . near the magic open - fraction",
    "however , @xmath31 has a well defined minimum .     in the @xmath0-@xmath4 plane corresponding to the 1-@xmath32 uncertainty of the parameters .",
    "contours are shown for simulated data sets with @xmath33 , @xmath34 100 nm , and different values of @xmath4 .",

    "we repeated this procedure until the magic open fraction was reached .",
    "the samples were coated using a hummer iv sputter coater with a au / pd target .",
    "the coating was applied using a plasma current of 2 ma for 30 seconds at a pressure of about 100 mtorr ; this nominally corresponds to a 1 nm layer of deposition .",
    "the mean free path length under these sputtering conditions is about 1 mm which means that the deposition occurs at a wide range of angles ( omnidirectional ) and that a simple geometric model of the atomic trajectories suffices to determine how much material is deposited on the inside walls of the grating bars .",
    "a coating was applied to both the front and back of the grating .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath0 and @xmath4 requires additional knowledge of a grating s geometric parameters .",
    "we obtain these parameters from rocking curves by doing a least squares fit to the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : in_all_2000 ] . a careful analysis of the covariance matrix for this fit shows that there are two parameters , that can be determined independently of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "these parameters are the wedge angle ( @xmath5 ) , and the rotation angle beyond which no atoms can pass through the grating ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "armed with this knowledge of @xmath5 and @xmath37 , we measured the ratio @xmath16 as a function of velocity to determine @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "these data are shown in fig .",

    "in the study of atom - surface interactions it is usually undesirable to cover the surface with any coatings .",
    "we can use a technique similar to the one above on a grating of any initial open - fraction , by rotating the grating around a grating bar .",
    "when the grating is rotated by an angle greater than the wedge angle @xmath5 , the projected open - fraction is reduced ( see fig . [",
    "fig : gr_dr ] ) . when we rotate the grating , the acquired phase profile changes as the inside surfaces of the grating bar are either rotated towards or away from the path of the atoms .",
    "taking into account this change , we can rotate the grating by a particular `` magic '' angle @xmath13 such that eqn .",

    "we do not know a priori at what angle to position the grating , since we would need to know both the window width and @xmath0 to calculate the magic angle .",
