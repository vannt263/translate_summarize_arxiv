    "neutron stars offer an interesting interplay between nuclear processes and astrophysical observables .",
    "conditions of matter inside such objects are very different from those one can find on earth , so a good knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) at such high densities is required to understand the properties of neutron stars . at densities near to the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) , matter is mainly composed of neutrons , protons and electrons in @xmath0-equilibrium . when the density increases new degrees of freedom may appear such as pion o kaon condenstates , quark matter or hyperons .",
    "the presence of the latter on neutron star matter is the topic of the present work .",
    "hyperonic degrees of freedom have been considered by several authors , mainly within the framework of relativistic mean field models @xcite or parametrized effective interactions @xcite .",
    "recently schulze _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have performed many - body calculations with realistic hyperon - nucleon interactions in order to study the onset point of hyperons in neutron star matter and the effect of nucleonic three - body forces .",
    "nevertheless , they have not considered the role of the hyperon - hyperon interaction , which , however , is essential as soon as the first hyperon appears in matter , because it modifies the single - particle energies of all the species and , as a consequence , the chemical potentials and the equilibrium conditions .",
    "we present results for a microscopic many - body calculation of the brueckner ",
    "hartree  fock ( bhf ) type for @xmath0-stable neutron star matter with nucleonic and hyperonic degrees of freedom including not only the nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon interactions but also the hyperon - hyperon ones .",
    "special attention will be paid to the role of this interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will describe very briefly the formalism we have employed .",
    "results for the composition and the eos of @xmath0-stable neutron star matter and for the structure of the star will be presented in section 3 .",
    "a short summary and some conclusions will be given in section 4 .",
    "our many - body scheme starts with the most recent parametrization of the bare baryon - baryon potential for the complete baryon octet as defined by stoks and rijken in ref .",
    "this potential describes all the strangeness sectors from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and is based on su(3 ) extensions of the nijmegen nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon potentials .",
    "we introduce effects from the medium by constructing the so - called @xmath8 matrix and solving the equations for the single - particle energies of the various baryons self - consistently .",
    "the @xmath8 matrix is formally given by the solution of the bethe - goldstone integral equation @xmath9    at lowest order in the bhf theory the single - particle potential @xmath10 of a baryon @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 and the total non - relativistic energy density , relative to the nucleon mass , reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the contribution of the leptons , considered here as a free gas .",
    "the chemical potentials are @xmath15 where the superscript in the potential denote the interaction of baryon @xmath16 with nucleons ( @xmath17 ) or hyperons ( @xmath18 ) .    in order to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter",
    ", we have replaced the pure nucleonic part of the eos by the variational calculation of akmal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which employs the argonne @xmath19 interaction with three - body forces and relativistic boost corrections .",
    "more details can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the composition of @xmath0-stable neutron star matter up to density @xmath20 @xmath5 .",
    "solid lines correspond to a calculation in which all the interactions ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) are included , dashed lines show the result when @xmath23 interaction is switched off .",
    "@xmath1 appears in both cases at the same density because it is the first hyperon to appear and therefore the @xmath23 interaction plays no role for densities below this point .",
    "there is a reduction of its fraction when @xmath23 is switched off because of the absence of the strongly attractive @xmath24 interaction . in turn ,",
    "a moderate increase on the lepton fraction is observed in order to keep charge neutrality . on the other hand",
    "less @xmath1 implies less @xmath25 pairs , whose interaction is very attractive in this model .",
    "this means that the neutron chemical potential becomes less attractive and , as a consequence , @xmath2 appears at a smaller density and has a larger relative fraction .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the eos for four different cases : pure nucleonic matter , matter with nucleons and free hyperons , matter with nucleons and hyperons interacting only with nucleons , and matter with nucleons and hyperons interacting both with nucleons and hyperons .",
    "the appearance of hyperons leads to a considerable softening of the eos , which is due essentialy to a reduction of the kinetic energy .",
    "the @xmath22 interaction has two effects . for densities up to @xmath26 @xmath5 , it is attractive and makes the eos even softer .",
    "but for larger densities it is repulsive and the eos becomes slightly stiffer .",
    "the @xmath23 interaction is always attractive producing a softening of the eos over the whole range of densities explored .",
    "finally , we have solved the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations , with and without rotational corrections , for three of the eos discussed in the previous paragraph . for @xmath0-stable pure nucleonic matter",
    "the eos is rather stiff and yields a maximum mass of @xmath27 without rotational corrections and @xmath28 when rotational corrections are included , where @xmath29 is the solar mass .",
    "a second set of results refers to the case where we allow for the presence of hyperons and consider the hyperon - nucleon interaction but explicitly exclude the hyperon - hyperon one . without rotational correction",
    "we obtain a maximum mass @xmath30 , whereas the rotational correction increases the mass to @xmath31 .",
    "this large reduction is mainly a consequence of the strong softening of the eos due to the appearance of hyperons .",
    "the last eos includes also the hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "the inclusion of the hyperon - hyperon interaction leads to a further softening of the eos and this leads to an additional reduction of the total mass . in this case",
    "whe obtain a maximum mass of @xmath32 when rotational corrections are not included and @xmath33 when rotation is taken into account .",
    "if other hyperons were to appear at higher densities , this would most likely lead to a further sosftening of the eos , and thereby smaller neutron star masses .",
    "although we have only considered the formation of hyperons in neutron stars , transitions to other degrees of freedom such as quark matter , kaon condensation , and pion condensation may or may not take place in neutron star matter .",
    "we would , however , like to emphasize that the hyperon formation mechanism is perhaps the most robust one and is likely to occur in the interior of a neutron star , unless the hyperon self - energies are strongly repulsive due to a possible repulsive hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions , a repulsion which would contradict present data on hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the eos with hyperons yields , however , maximum neutron star masses which are barely compatible with the observations of around @xmath34 .",
    "this means that our eos with hyperons needs to be stiffer , a fact which may in turn imply more complicated many - body terms not included in our calculations , such as three - body forces between nucleons and hyperons @xcite and/or relativistic effects , are needed .",
    "with the most recent parametrization of the bare baryon - baryon potential for the complete octet of baryons , we have performed a microscopic calculation of the brueckner  hartree ",
    "fock type of the structure of @xmath0-stable neutron star matter including nucleonic and hyperonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the potential model employed allows only for the presence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 hyperons up to densities of about seven times nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "the presence of hyperons leads to a considerable softening of the eos , entailing a corresponding reduction of the maximum mass of the neutron star .",
    "the inclusion of the hyperon - hyperon interaction leads to a further softening of the eos , since this interaction is attractive over the whole density range explored .",
    "this is mainly due to the @xmath35 interaction which is strongly enough to develop a bound state @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the @xmath36 attraction produced by this model is only mild , not being able to reproduce the experimental @xmath37 separation energy of @xmath38 mev .",
    "whether this additional softening is realistic or not will depend on the details of the hyperon - hyperon interaction that is , unfortunatelly , not well constrained at present .",
    "new data in the @xmath39 sector , either from double-@xmath2 hypernuclei or from @xmath40-atoms , are very much awaited for .",
