    "supergravity was originally developed as an elementary field theory which should avoid the ultraviolet divergencies and consequently would represent the long awaited unification of gravity with the remaining fundamental interactions of nature .",
    "supersymmetry plays an important role in the development of unification models beyond the standard model of elementary particles , in the formulation of the conceptual fundamentals of quantum field theory and quantum gravity , and more recently in the understanding of important aspects of superstring theory ( see , for instance , @xcite for reviews of the conceptual basis of supersymmetry and supergravity ) .",
    "today , supergravity is considered in the first place as an effective field theory which should describe the low - mass degrees of freedom of a more fundamental theory , probably the still unknown m - theory ; however , at the moment the only known candidate for such a theory is superstring theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the classical field equations following from the @xmath0 supergravity lagrangian were derived in @xcite by using the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "there are constraints for each of the gauge symmetries contained in the theory : spacetime diffeomorphisms , local lorentz invariance , and supersymmetry .",
    "one important result that follows from the analysis of the field equations is that one of the constraints relates the torsion tensor and the rarita - schwinger field so that it can be used to eliminate the torsion tensor from the theory .",
    "the canonical quantization of supergravity is performed in general by applying dirac s procedure for constrained systems .",
    "one uses the 3 + 1 decomposition of the canonical theory to obtain a hamiltonian in which the symmetry generators of the gauge fields are constrained by lagrange multipliers .",
    "then it is postulated that the wave function is annihilated by all the constraints . in the case of @xmath0 supergravity",
    "there are three constraints : the hamiltonian constraint , the generators of lorentz rotations and the supersymmetric constraint .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the hamiltonian constraint is identically satisfied once the supersymmetric constraint is fulfilled .",
    "accordingly , only the lorentz and supersymmetric constraints are the central issue .",
    "the study of @xmath0 supergravity models has been limited so far to minisuperspace models @xcite as direct generalizations of quantum cosmology models .",
    "the standard approach to quantum cosmology consists in canonically quantizing a minisuperspace model which is obtained by imposing certain symmetry conditions on the metrics allowed on the spacelike slices of the universe .",
    "this procedure , however , reduces the number of degrees of freedom to a finite number and the problem of quantization can be attacked by applying the canonical methods of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by the wheeler - dewitt equation which is a second order differential constraint equation following from general covariance , and acts on the wave function of the universe .",
    "the most general minisuperspace models analyzed in the literature correspond to homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi cosmological models .",
    "since the corresponding metrics depend only on time , the dynamics of the spacelike 3-dimensional slices becomes trivial , unless an additional reparametrization is performed .",
    "usually , in the reparametrization one of the scale factors of the bianchi metric is taken as  internal time \" so that the wheeler - dewitt equation generates a wave function of the universe which explicitly depends on the internal time and the remaining scale factors .",
    "although this is a quite elegant procedure which in each case leads to an explicit wave function of the universe , the main problem regarding the existence of classical initial singularity remains unsolved .",
    "in fact , in all analyzed minisuperspaces the classical singularity remains at the quantum level .",
    "moreover , the original hope that the behavior of minisuperspace models would hold at least qualitatively in the full theory seems to be not realized .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that even in the simple case of a microsuperspace ( a reduced minisuperspace ) contained in the seed minisuperspace the behavior of the corresponding wave functions is widely different .",
    "the problem of the initial classical singularity has been attacked alternatively by proposing a wave function for the ground state @xcite or a tunneling effect @xcite , among other proposals . in both cases",
    "the main idea consists in replacing the classical singularity by an _",
    "ad hoc _ postulated universe .",
    "the initial singularity problem remains thus unsolved .",
    "the consideration of an additional rarita - schwinger field in the context of supergravity minisuperspace models ( supersymmetric quantum cosmology ) does not solve the problem , and the classical singularity remains .",
    "in all the cases the failure to solve the singularity problem can be attributed to the fact that , due to the strong symmetry reduction , only a finite number of degrees of freedom can be considered . to face this difficulty one needs to analyze genuine field theories with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "an option would be to consider milder symmetry reductions which leave unaffected a specific set of true local degrees of freedom .",
    "these are the so called midisuperspace models . such spacetimes have a long history in general relativity . indeed , any spacetime which allows the existence of two commuting killing vector fields leads to a real field theory with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the field equations in this case can be shown to be equivalent to the wave equation for a scalar field propagating in a fictitious flat 2 + 1-dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "the local degrees of freedom are contained in the scalar field .    in this work",
    "we will consider the specific midisuperspace described by gowdy @xmath1 cosmological models @xcite in the context of @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "we will find an explicit expression for the wave function of the universe and will show that the mere consideration of a genuine field theory leads to a solution of the singularity problem .",
    "in fact , the singular behavior of gowdy models at a certain time of their evolution has been investigated in detail at the classical level .",
    "it has been shown that the behavior of the metric near the singularity corresponds to the so called  asymptotically velocity term dominated \" ( avtd ) behavior ( see , for instance @xcite , for a recent review ) .",
    "we will see that the avtd singular behavior disappears at the level of the corresponding wave function of the universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we revise the canonical formulation of supergravity @xmath0 and analyze the lorentz constraint , following closely notations and conventions of @xcite . in section [ sec3 ] we present the gowdy @xmath1 cosmological models and their main properties .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the investigation of the supersymmetric constraint and the solutions for the wave function of the universe .",
    "finally , section [ con ] contains several final remarks and the conclusions with indications about different possibilities of generalizing the results derived in this work .",
    "we adopt the following conventions and notations .",
    "indices related to world coordinates are denoted by greek letters .",
    "the ones from the middle of the alphabet , i. e. @xmath2 , run over 0,1,2,3 and the ones from the beginning of the alphabet , i. e. @xmath3 , represent only spatial coordinates 1,2,3 .",
    "capital latin indices , i.e. @xmath4 can take the values 0,1,2,3 and the small ones run over 1,2,3 ; both of them refer to to components in an orthonormal local frame , for which we use the local metric @xmath5 .",
    "the fields of @xmath0 supergravity in 4 dimensions are the vierbein @xmath6 and the rarita - schwinger gravitino @xmath7 , which is a vector of majorana spinors .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the covariant derivative with the lorentz generators @xmath10 .",
    "for the @xmath11 matrices we use the real majorana representation [ s4 ] ^0= (    cc 0&^2 + ^2&0    ) , ^1= (    cc i^3&0 + 0&i^3    ) , ^2= (    cc 0&-^2 + ^2&0    ) , ^3= (    cc -i^1&0 + 0&-i^1    ) , in which the anticommutator relation @xmath12 is satisfied , and @xmath13 are the standard pauli matrices .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 . in this representation @xmath15 is known as the majorana condition .",
    "the ( endomorphic ) components of the ricci rotation coefficients can be obtained from cartan s first structure equation @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "notice that in general the ricci rotation coefficients contain a contorsion term .",
    "however , as we mentioned in the introduction the torsion tensor can be eliminated from the theory by using one of the constraint equations .    applying the canonical 3 + 1 decomposition of spacetime @xcite",
    "the canonical variables can be chosen to be the spatial components of the tetrad vectors @xmath18 , their conjugate momenta @xmath19 , and the spatial covariant components of the spinor @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", the corresponding temporal components turn out to be lagrange multipliers of the hamiltonian which contains only the constraints associated with the three different types of symmetries of the system : @xmath21 here @xmath22 contains the usual hamiltonian and diffeomorphisms constraints , @xmath23 is the lorentz constraint and @xmath24 denotes the supersymmetric constraint .",
    "according to dirac s canonical quantization procedure for constrained systems , the physical states @xmath25 must be annihilated by the corresponding constraint operators , i.e. @xmath26 from the fact that the supergravity operators satisfy teitelboim s algebra @xcite it follows that the condition @xmath27 is satisfied identically once @xmath28 is fulfilled .",
    "consequently , we need to consider only the lorentz and supersymmetric constraints .    it is convenient to use , instead of the gravitino field , the densitized local components ( @xmath29 is a lagrange multiplier and so is @xmath30 ) @xmath31 as the basic fields commuting with all non  spinor variables , where @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , if we choose an @xmath33 basis it is possible to show that all bosonic terms of the lorentz constraint cancel each other , yielding @xcite @xmath34 } \\label{lorentz}\\ , , \\ ] ] and the generator of supersymmetry is given by @xmath35 where a factor ordering is usually chosen @xcite .",
    "let us first analyze the lorentz condition @xmath36 that explicitly reads @xmath37 since this constraint does not affect the component @xmath38 , a particular solution is to keep @xmath38 arbitrary and _ ii=_iii=_iv=0 .",
    "[ rfc ] this is the  rest - frame \" solution @xcite in which only the component @xmath38 remains to be determined by the supersymmetric constraint .",
    "if none of the conditions ( [ rfc ] ) is satisfied , the lorentz constraint implies that @xcite @xmath39 notice that in the representation we are using here the lorentz generators @xmath40 are @xmath41 matrices .",
    "therefore , the components @xmath42 , and @xmath43 of the wave function must be considered as @xmath44 matrices .",
    "there are two alternative ways to solve the system of algebraic equations given in ( [ sys1])([sys3 ] ) .",
    "the first one consists in taking the components @xmath45 , and @xmath43 proportional to each other .",
    "the proportionality factors can be absorbed by redefining each component of the wave function so that this case can be written as _",
    "ii = _ iii = _ iv  .",
    "[ tcpsi ] then from eqs.([sys1])-([sys3 ] ) it follows that _ 12 = - j_13 = j_23  , [ tcj ] a condition which implies a trivialization of the lorentz constraint .",
    "then from the expression ( [ lorentz ] ) we can determine the components of the gravitino field .",
    "in the trivial case ( [ tcj ] ) we obtain _ 1 = - _ 2 = _ 3  .",
    "[ tcphi ]    the second possibility is to solve explicitly the system of equations ( [ sys1])([sys3 ] ) .",
    "the relation between the components of the lorentz generators can be solved by representing each component as a product of @xmath46-matrices , under the condition that the corresponding lorentz algebra is preserved .",
    "alternatively we can use the standard generators of the ordinary rotation group @xmath47 as given in @xcite _ 12=-i (    cccc 0&0&0&0 + 0&0&1&0 + 0&-1&0&0 + 0&0&0&0    ) , j_13=i (    cccc 0&0&0&0 + 0&0&0&-1 + 0&0&0&0 + 0&1&0&0    ) , j_23=-i (    cccc 0&0&0&0 + 0&0&0&0 + 0&0&0&1 + 0&0&-1&0    ) . solving explicitly the lorentz constraint ( [ sys1])([sys3 ] ) in this representation it is easy to see that for each of the vectors @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath43 only one component is different from zero .",
    "that is to say the wave function of the universe can be represented as [ wfu0 ] =(    c _ i + _ ii + _ iii + _ iv    ) = e (    c * a*_0 + b_0 + c_0 + d_0    ) , where @xmath50 is a function to be determined , @xmath51 is an arbitrary 4vector and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are arbitrary constants . for the sake of simplicity later on we will consider the special case @xmath55 .",
    "so we have shown that the wave function ( [ wfu0 ] ) explicitly solves the lorentz constraint . the remaining function @xmath50 and the arbitrary constants @xmath56 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 have to be chosen so that the supersymmetric constraint is satisfied .",
    "this ends the analysis of the lorentz constraint .",

    "the local degrees of freedom contained in the scalar field are true gravitational degrees of freedom which can not be eliminated by a choice of gauge .",

    "it is now easy to see that eqs.([conds3 ] ) does not allow any solutions compatible with ( [ sol1 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the only compatible solution is for @xmath139 , a result which implies that an explicit dependence on the spatial coordinates @xmath94 and @xmath95 is not allowed and , therefore , the existence of anomalies in the wave function of the universe is completely excluded .    under the above considerations , the resulting differential equation for @xmath133 can easily be integrated and yields @xmath140 . the imaginary part can again be considered as a phase and , therefore , the behavior of the wave function of the universe is completely dictated by the behavior of the metric function @xmath60 only .",

    "the behavior of the real part of @xmath149 is governed by the behavior of the metric function @xmath60 and an integral which involves the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "hence , we need the explicit form of the metric in order to analyze the wave function of the universe . as mentioned before , it is very difficult to solve the system of differential equations which follow from einstein s vacuum field equations . to analyze the behavior of the wave function near the singularity it would be necessary to apply numerical methods for handling the metric functions",
    "this is a task which is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "our analysis of the supersymmetric constraint presented in the last sections relies on a very specific foliation of spacetime .",
    "in fact , the general form of the constraint @xmath150 fixes at the very beginning the time coordinate @xmath151 so that it does not appear as a dynamical variable in the further analysis .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath152 which is the natural time coordinate in gowdy cosmological models .",
    "the canonical quantization formalism forces us to `` freeze '' this time during the entire analysis and it reappears explicitly only in the solutions for the wave function of the universe , where we interpret it as a label which associates a particular value of the wave function to a different spatial slice .",
    "it is in this sense that we can say that we know explicitly the wave function of the universe at each moment of time . and",
    "it is in this context that we were able to investigate the behavior of the wave function near the cosmological singularity .",
    "consequently , the problem of the `` frozen '' time in our analysis can not be solved in the context of the canonical quantization formalism .",
    "the common concern about the use of this formalism is whether the final result of the quantization ( in our case , the wave function of the universe ) depends on the choice of a particular foliation . to clarify this question in the present case",
    "let us consider a different quite general foliation .",
    "consider a new time coordinate @xmath153 defined by dt = e^-(+ 3 ) d  .",
    "[ ttran ] then , from the general line element ( [ gle ] ) we obtain ds^2 = d t^2 - e^2 d^2 - e^f ( e^p d^2 + e^-p d^2 )  , [ gle1 ] where @xmath154 and @xmath155 . for the sake of simplicity we are considering here the polarized case only @xmath71 . in this particular parametrization",
    "the lapse function becomes a constant .",
    "we apply now the canonical quantization procedure of supergravity with a foliation determined by @xmath156const .",
    "clearly , this is a quite radical change of foliation when compared with the original one @xmath157const ) . to calculate the supersymmetric constraint we proceed as in section [ sec4 ] for the non - trivial solution ( [ wfu0 ] ) .",
    "then we obtain = e^+2f s_1 + e^ ( 4 + 3f+p ) s_2  , [ susycnt ] with @xmath158 if we compare these expressions with the supersymmetric constraint in the original foliation , given in eqs.([s1nt ] ) and ( [ s2nt ] ) , we see that the general structure does not change .",
    "the integration of the differential equations following from applying ( [ s1nt1 ] ) and ( [ s2nt2 ] ) to the wave function leads to a solution with a structure similar to that of eq.([wfu1 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the general behavior of the wave function of the universe is qualitatively invariant with respect to a transformation of the time coordinate as given in eq.([ttran ] ) .",
    "this coordinate transformation of time is quite general since it involves all the nonignorable coordinates present in gowdy models and implies a constant lapse function .",
    "clearly , the qualitative independence of the wave function of the universe holds also in the case of less general coordinate transformations .",
    "it is necessary to mention that for the expression of the lorentz constraint in terms of the gravitino field ( [ lorentz ] ) there is only one possible choice , namely _",
    "1 ~^1  , _ 2 ~^2  , _ 3 ~^3  .",
    "[ papi1 ] on the other hand , for the solution of the supersymmetric constraint we use the choice ( [ papi ] ) which is more convenient for the analysis of the resulting differential equations .",
    "nevertheless , one could use the representation ( [ papi1 ] ) since the final result for the wave function of the universe does not depend on the particular used representation .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the physical interpretation of the wave function of the universe @xmath25 presents certain difficulties . a genuine wave function",
    "must be related to observable quantities and this implies that @xmath25 must yield a probability density . however ,",
    "this is not true in this case , in particular because the wave function of the universe is not normalizable .",
    "moreover , if we require that @xmath25 yields a probability density for the 3-geometry which must have a specific value at a given time , this would imply a violation of the hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "these difficulties in the interpretation of the wave function of the universe are the price one has to pay for applying the canonical quantization procedure which involves the isolation of a specific `` time '' parameter against which the evolution of the system can be defined . an alternative procedure like the dirac quantization based on functional integrals , which does not require to single out the time variable , could lead to a quantum system with less interpretation difficulties @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have investigated the gowdy @xmath1 cosmological models in the context of @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "the quantum constraints resulting from the canonical quantization formalism were explicitly analyzed , and for the resulting set of differential equations we were able to find general solutions . in this way , we found the wave function of the universe for the polarized and unpolarized special cases .",
    "this represents a proof of the existence of physical states in the @xmath159 supersymmetric midisuperspace corresponding to gowdy cosmologies .",
    "this result contrasts drastically with analogous investigations in minisuperspace ( bianchi ) models where no physical states exist , a result that sometimes is assumed as a sufficient proof to dismiss supergravity @xmath0 .",
    "we have adopted a less radical position in this work and dismiss as unphysical only the minisuperspace models .",
    "the existence of physical states in midisuperspace models confirms this conclusion and indicates that supergravity @xmath0 is a valuable theory which should be investigated further .",
    "in this context we have also obtained an interesting result showing that , in the gowdy @xmath1 midisuperspace model analyzed in this work , the wave function of the universe which represents nontrivial physical states is completely free of anomalies .",
    "gowdy cosmologies are characterized by the existence of a curvature singularity at temporal infinity , and it is known that the metric functions near the singularity evolve according to the avtd behavior .",
    "we have shown that after the canonical quantization the corresponding wave function of the universe is free of singularities .",
    "this represents a solution to the singularity problem and is one of the main results of this work .",
    "the mere presence of the rarita - schwinger field and the consideration of a genuine midisuperspace model is sufficient to eliminate the classical singularity .",
    "this result points to a further interesting and expected property of supergravity @xmath0 in the sense that it is able to properly handle the conceptual limits of classical general relativity .    in this work we focused on the special case of @xmath1 cosmologies .",
    "the generalization of our results to include the case of @xmath57 gowdy models seems to be straightforward . in particular , we believe that the unified parametrization introduced in @xcite , which contains both types of topologies , could be useful to explore the supersymmetric gowdy model in quite general terms .",
