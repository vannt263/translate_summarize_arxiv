    "direct imaging of exoplanetary systems is difficult due to the high contrast in brightness between the planet and the star , resulting in a situation in which the planetary image is confounded with the transient details of the telescope s point spread function ( psf ) . to date , all methods for direct imaging of exoplanets have relied on subtracting the psf from the observed image to obtain the final science image . typically , the psf subtraction is achieved through differential imaging methods , which have been applied extensively in the recent literature .",
    "the fundamental difficulties associated with differential imaging methods , most notably angular differential imaging ( adi ) and spectral differential imaging ( sdi ) , have been reviewed in [ ] and references therein .",
    "briefly , sdi is nearly useless close to the host star because the difference in the point spread function ( psf ) at two wavelengths is proportional to the distance from the center of the image , and adi assumes that the optical aberrations are not changing in time .",
    "since differential imaging methods require estimating the speckle background from the final image , they suffer from a severe statistical penalty close to center @xcite , which is the most scientifically fruitful part of the image @xcite .",
    "it is the author s belief that the combination of millisecond pupil plane and focal plane telemetry will lead to a large improvement in contrast over differential imaging techniques , as it leverages a vastly larger and richer data set than methods that use standard exposure times , which average over the atmospheric turbulence .",
    "such methods are becoming practical due to a new generation of ultra - low noise ir cameras capable of khz readouts , such as the swir single photon detector , saphira eapd and the mkids @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the author s millisecond imaging techniques can be generalized to take advantage of essentially all constraints on problem proposed to date .",
    "these constraints include those imposed by diurnal rotation ( used by adi ) , multi - wavelength observations ( used by sdi ) , as well polarization ( used in polarization differential imaging @xcite ) .",
    "the basic concept of the author s approach was explained in [ ] . essentially , these papers provide a system of equations that express the instantaneous image measured in the science camera ( sc ) in terms of :    * the residual phase [ which is measured by the wavefront sensor ( wfs ) ] * the planetary image * non - common path aberrations ( ncpa ) .",
    "r0pt    this system of equations forms the basis of a regression problem in which the ncpa and the planetary image are estimated self - consistently .",
    "the information required to successfully perform the estimation is provided by the variability of the residual phase ( so it is closely related to other phase diversity methods ) , although multi - wavelength and diurnal rotation constraints could be employed as well . in [ ] , the author extended this approach to include non - pupil plane ncpa , which requires summing the contributions from unknown aberrations in various optical planes .",
    "the resulting expression is very complicated and computationally demanding because it requires propagation operators between the various optical planes . here",
    ", the problem is formulated in full rigor , but in a way that is far more computationally tractable and should be suitable for parallel computation .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that the model has more degrees of freedom , but the richness of the millisecond data streams may well afford such a luxury .",
    "consider a telescope with a single conjugate , closed - loop ao system and a coronagraph , similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_schematic ] .",
    "assume that the ao system is using the only the star at the center of the putative solar system under investigation to track the turbulence .",

    "the @xmath15  operator includes 2d integration over the entrance pupil coordinate @xmath5 . in keeping with notational conventions established in [ ] , the operator @xmath16 , which propagates the field from plane @xmath17 to plane @xmath18 , includes interaction with the optical surface @xmath18 , but does not include interaction with optical surface @xmath17 .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_schematic ] , after interacting with the dm the light goes through a beam splitter ( bs ) , with some light going to the wfs and some to the coronagraph and sc . for optical systems with a different design , e.g. , using dichroic instead of a bs ,",

    "( [ u_c - u_w ] ) is fundamental to this analysis because it relates the sc field to the wfs field .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we define the residual phase @xmath31  to be ( complex - valued ) phase of the starlight impinging on the wfs ( including the effects of ncpa ) , then the field impinging on the wfs is also given by : @xmath32 \\ , ,   \\label{u_w - resid}\\ ] ] where the pointing error @xmath6  is included explicitly , and the factor @xmath33  is the demagnification .",

    "is introduced here .",

    "<S> millisecond focal plane telemetry is now becoming practical due to a new generation of near - ir detector arrays with sub - electron noise that are capable of khz readout rates . combining these data with those simultaneously available from the wavefront sensing system </S>",

    "<S> . this approach may be especially advantageous for finding planets within about 3 @xmath0  of the star where differential imaging is ineffective . as shown in a recent article by the author ( j. opt . </S>",

    "<S> a. , 33 , 712 , 2016 ) , one must account for unknown aberrations in several non - conjugate planes of the optical system , which , in turn , requires ability to computational propagate the field between these planes . </S>",
    "<S> these computations are likely to be difficult to implement and expensive . here , a far more convenient alternative based on empirical green s functions is provided . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the empirical green s function ( egf ) , which accounts for all multi - planar , non - common path aberrations , and results in a much more tractable and highly parallel computational problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the egf can be generalized to treat polarization , resulting in the empirical green s tensor ( egt ) . </S>"
