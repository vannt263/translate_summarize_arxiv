    "possible differences between the monte carlo simulation and data @xmath106 and @xmath107 distributions , which may arise for many reasons including uncertainties in the parton distribution functions , inadequacies in the qcd model or uncertainties in the @xmath3 quark fragmentation , are accounted for in the systematic error by weighting the monte carlo hadron level distributions by @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively . here",

    "this is the observed difference between data and monte carlo simulation for the negative to positive light jet tag ratio ( see section  [ sec : bfraction ] ) .",
    "since it is not _ a priori _ known whether the jets contain one or two heavy quarks , an uncertainty in the shape of the @xmath34 ( @xmath3 ) quark template is estimated by taking half the difference between results obtained using the templates when there is one or two @xmath34 ( @xmath3 ) hadrons within a cone of 0.7 around the jet axis .",

    "this systematic uncertainty also covers any differences observed between data and simulation in the @xmath3-quark rich sample used to determine the efficiency ( see section [ sec : selection ] ) .    an uncertainty on the misidentified electron and muon backgrounds is estimated to be @xmath174 of the estimated contribution ( see section  [ sec : backgrounds ] ) .",

    "note that in the analysis by the d  collaboration , an nlo qcd prediction for the ratio of the @xmath110 quark to the @xmath198 quark production rate is assumed .",
