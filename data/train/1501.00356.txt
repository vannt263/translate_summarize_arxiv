    "reactor neutrinos have been used for fundamental research since the discovery of neutrinos . the last decade",
    "have witnessed a remarkable reduction of systematic error in reactor neutrino experiments , by about one of order of magnitude , imposed by the high precision needed to measure @xmath0 by double chooz  @xcite  ( dc ) , daya bay  @xcite  ( db ) and reno  @xcite , a milestone for the world strategy of neutrino flavour research .",
    "reno has released several updates of the @xmath0 analysis in conferences here disregarded until publications follow .",
    "the reactor measurements are consistent with all measurements sensitive to @xmath0  @xcite obtained via other techniques providing a coherent @xmath0 perspective , as obtained by global fit analyses  @xcite .",
    "since the reactor @xmath0 experiments precision is unrivalled , they are expected to dominate the world knowledge on @xmath0 , likely , for a few decades to go .",
    "hence , reactor systematic dominates much of the @xmath0 world knowledge , as experiments reach their final sensitivities .",
    "the measured @xmath0 ( and its uncertainty ) is expected to play a critical role to constrain , or measure , still unknown neutrino oscillation observables , such as cp - violation and the atmospheric mass hierarchy  @xcite .    to maximise the sensitivity to @xmath0 ,",
    "reactor experiments were forced to conceived experimental setups where flux , detection and background systematics are controlled to the unprecedented level of a few per - mille each contribution ( < 1% total ) .",
    "the statical resolution is boosted by using multi - reactors sites .",
    "the unprecedented precision achieved is experimentally very challenging , therefore the redundancy @xmath0-experiments is critical , specially if their uncertainty budgets are complementary to offer maximal cross - validation . despite some complementary , the reactor experimental setups are unavoidably similar and suffer from similar limitations , hence validation by different techniques would be important , although the precision needed is unattainable today .",
    "the fore - mentioned precision improvement was obtained via multi - detector experimental setups , whereby , at least , two detectors are used for the reduction of the overall systematic budget since correlated systematics among detectors cancel out",
    ". this way , while the _ absolute systematics _ are the same , the _ relative systematics _ are much lower .",
    "the _ absolute systematics _ are still dominant in any single - detector setup , such as dc ( single detector ) , but also all past and , likely , most future reactor experiments .",
    "the systematics reduced by the multi - detector configuration are : detection and flux systematics .",
    "detection systematics benefit from dedicated detector design for them to be _ effectively identical _ , typically so , only upon full calibration , thus implying the same ( or negligibly different ) responses and composition ( cross - section , proton number , etc ) .",
    "flux systematics benefit from the fact that the _ near _ detector(s ) is located closer the reactor(s ) such that the flux modulation originating from neutrino oscillations , @xmath0 in this case , is negligible ( or very small ) compared to the _ far _ detector(s ) located further away .",
    "the far is placed at the expected maximal oscillation deficit driven by the @xmath2 ( atmospheric ) constraint by minos  @xcite and t2k  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the flux systematic is highly non - trivial , being the main subject of this publication .",
    "while having effectively identical detectors suffices to reduce detection systematics , from @xmath12.0%  @xcite to @xmath10.2%  @xcite , just having near and far detectors will not necessarily provide a full cancellation of flux systematics - unlike what was originally thought .",
    "there are three mechanisms leading to possible flux systematic reduction to be elaborated in detail within the paper .",
    "first , multi - reactor uncorrelated uncertainties can benefit from having several identical reactors .",
    "second , the near - far geometry of the experimental setup could enhance ability for the near become an effective _ perfect monitor _ to the far ; i.e. cancelling fully the flux systematic error . and , third",
    ", the nature of the reactor uncertainties ; i.e. whether correlated or uncorrelated among reactors ; might be exploited , as measured by multiple detectors .",
    "reactor systematics suppress from single detector scenario , typically @xmath13%",
    "@xcite to < 1% for multi - detector setups .",
    "dc achieves an impressive @xmath11.7%  @xcite for a single - detector setup using the bugey4 data for the mean cross - section per fission normalisation of the fission ; i.e. as an effective _ normalisation - only near_. the most accurate reactor flux anti - neutrino spectrum predictions  @xcite rely on the ill uranium and plutonium isotopes input data  @xcite .",
    "however , the final flux systematics are a combination of the reactor and spectral systematic errors and depends on depends on each experiment configuration , since the evolution of the fission elements depends on the running configuration of each reactor .",
    "therefore flux systematics are expected , with current knowledge , to be the dominant contribution for some of the reactor @xmath0 experiments , such as db , itself leading the world @xmath0 precision .",
    "this publication develops a framework for the non - trivial propagation of the reactor flux uncertainties and their suppression in the context of multi - detector and multi - reactor experimental setups , providing mechanism for the improvement of the global @xmath0 precision .",
    "most our discussion stays generic on flux systematic propagation ; i.e. no need for the specific experiment error breakdown , allowing easy relative comparison across all experiments .",
    "our study cases , however , inspired on the specific reactor-@xmath0 experiments configurations for maximal pertinence .",
    "the core of our calculations is analytical , but a cross - check was implemented using a dedicated monte - carlo - based analysis , is also presented .",
    "the discussion starts from the simplest single detector configuration , then evolving towards a general formalism applicable to any multi - detector and multi - reactor setups .",
    "the numbers linked to the specific experimental setups are however only guidelines as they are obtained in simplified scenarios , again , to maximise comparability .",
    "so far , the reactor @xmath0-experiments appear to treat the reactor systematics similarly . however , all collaborations are lacking dedicated publications on the topic , so questions about the coherence across collaboration remain .",
    "below , we will briefly summarise the reactor flux systematics information , as provided by the different collaborations .",
    "most experiments rely on pwr reactors , hence the anti - neutrino flux is dominated by four isotopes : @xmath3u , @xmath4pu,@xmath5pu and @xmath6u ( ordered by contribution relevance ) . in general , flux systematics uncertainties are typically broken down into three terms : thermal power , fission fractions and spent fuel , as summarised in table  [ tab - uncorpar ] .",
    "the thermal power history is usually provided by the electricity company exploiting the reactor .",
    "the associated error is related to the measurement method , the precision of the installed sensors and the employed sensors calibration  @xcite .",
    "each experiment has to precisely study the way how the thermal power is measured in order to estimate the corresponding error and the possible correlations among all the reactors involved , as typically , the same measurement techniques are applied to all identical reactors in a power plant .",
    "the fractional fission rates have to be computed through reactor simulations , while their uncertainty estimation is not simple as they depend on the reactor model and the approximations used for each setup  @xcite .",
    "after each cycle , the reactors are stopped for refuelling , typically once per year in a few weeks lasting operation . in this operation , part of the fuel assemblies are exchanged with new ones .",
    "the spent fuel are stored in the dedicated pools , typically located next to the reactor sites with slightly different baselines .",
    "the spent fuel long lived fission products can generate a small fraction of anti - neutrinos above the inverse beta decay threshold  @xcite .",
    "therefore , each experiment has to evaluate also the contribution from spent fuel and its uncertainty .    .",
    "reactor-@xmath0 experiments breakdown of detector flux 1@xmath7 systematic error  @xcite . the daya bay and",
    "reno errors quoted here are correspond to their uncorrelated contributions , as they relied on multi - detector setups .",
    "instead , the double chooz errors includes also the correlated contributions , as quoted from single - detector analysis .",
    "therefore , the double chooz error is expected to be overestimated and will be revised by the collaboration in future publications . thermal power",
    "( @xmath8 ) , fission fractions ( @xmath9 ) and spent fuel are considered . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - sf ]    since both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by eq .",
    "[ eq : deffigen ] , we can use directly eq .  [ eq_i2d2nr_final ] in order to get the expression for the corresponding sf . inserting the values of the geometrical parameters ,",
    "we show the variation of the sf relative weighting parameter in fig .",
    "[ fig - db_tune ] for fully uncorrelated errors of the reactor fluxes .",
    "the dotted curve represents the variation of the sf when all reactors are operational and the continuous curve represents the mean value between the values obtained when one reactor is off upon reactor refuelling scenario considered in the last section .",
    "the variations in such refuelling scenario are indicated by the grey area in fig .",
    "[ fig - db_tune ] accounting for the different reactors .",
    "there are two interesting cases to be highlighted    @xmath12 = 1 : : :    this point represents no relative weighting applied on the near sites ,    for which sf is @xmath10.20 .",
    "the spread of sf when    considering the reactor refuelling scenario is @xmath12% .",
    "@xmath12 at minimum : : :    the effective sf obtained is about @xmath10.05 .",
    "the spread    due to refuelling is about @xmath16% .",
    "our result is consistent with the official result of db  @xcite , where they obtained @xmath13 = 0.04 and @xmath14 = 0.3 for the analysed data period , considering that one of the near contains twice the events than the other , we obtained @xmath12 to be 3.38 . using mc",
    ", we also obtained respectively , 0.04 and 0.3 .",
    "our calculation here , thus serves as a replication .",
    "however , due to the difficulties on the physical interpretation of this , the corresponding sf is ignored any further in this publication .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that db discards it for the measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "we have identified , studied and quantified three mechanisms inducing reactor flux uncertainty suppression in the context of multi - detector experiments in multi - reactor sites .",
    "we have quantified the integral error suppression by the _ suppression fraction _ ( sf ) analytically ( cross - checked via mc ) using simplified experimental scenarios to allow coherent relative comparison across experiments .",
    "sf can take values within [ 0,1 ] , where the extreme cases stand , respectively , for total suppression ( sf=0 ) and no suppression(sf=1 ) .",
    "the three mechanisms can be characterised by their respective sf terms , since sf(total ) is defined as sf(total )  @xmath15",
    "sf(@xmath16 )  @xmath17  sf(iso - flux )  @xmath17  sf(correlation ) , where _ i _ )",
    "sf(@xmath16 ) is linked to @xmath18 scaling of the remaining uncorrelated reactor error , _ ii _ ) sf(iso - flux ) is linked to the site iso - flux condition and _ iii _ ) sf(correlation ) is linked to the nature of reactor errors .",
    "both sf(iso - flux ) and sf(correlation ) could lead to total error suppression under specific site conditions .",
    "if those terms are to be exploited , those conditions must be carefully evaluated and demonstrated by each experiments accounting accurately for all pertinent effects , although no experiment have ever done this .",
    "our final results relying simplified refuelling scenarios are summarised in table  [ tab - sf ] .",
    "this results are not expected to be used by experiments , but as mere guidelines for more accurate estimations to follow up .",
    "the contribution of sf(correlation ) was not quantified for any specific experimental setup , as it deserves more careful treatment discussed below .",
    "the sf(@xmath16 ) has been actively exploited in publications by experiments to improve our knowledge on @xmath0 under the assumption that the remaining error is is fully reactor uncorrelated .",
    "typically , @xmath16 refers to the number of effectively identical reactors per site . in the case of db and reno ,",
    "this term amounts to @xmath160% suppression ( 6 reactors ) , whereas this yields only @xmath130% suppression for dc - ii .",
    "typically , sf(@xmath16 ) is propagated into the @xmath0 precision as a byproduct of the @xmath19 minimisation .",
    "the estimation of sf(iso - flux ) has not been applied by any experiment so far .",
    "it is likely impractically to be implemented via the @xmath19 minimisation formulation , instead calculations might follows the prescription here presented . once estimated , as demonstrated in this publication , the sf(iso - flux ) is expected to improve the so far published results by db and reno , providing an extra flux error reduction by up to @xmath150% and @xmath140% , respectively on @xmath0 . due to the simplified conditions assumed for our calculations ,",
    "our sf s are expected to be slightly optimistic relative to those to be obtained by dedicated analyses by db and reno eventually . in the case",
    "dc - ii , the sf(iso - flux ) term is expected to yield a dramatic @xmath190% error reduction since the iso - flux condition is almost met .",
    "this makes dc - ii the only @xmath0 experiment likely to benefit from a negligible flux error , compared to other systematics .",
    "dc has officially prospected a conservative 0.1% as flux error for dc - ii  @xcite , well within the analysis here presented .",
    "therefore , dc - ii final @xmath0 sensitivity is expected to be dominated its challenging background systematic , thus in maximal complementary to db error budget . since the flux error is dominant for db , the hereby presented error reduction by @xmath150% translates into a significant improvement of the world @xmath0 precision by means of db alone , but also via the envisaged combination by all reactor experiments .    ,",
    "is shown for dc - ii , reno and db .",
    "all experiments have assumed , so far , their errors to be reactor uncorrelated ; i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "dc - ii benefits the best sf ( @xmath10.1 ) due to its almost iso - flux site . reno and db benefit mainly from the large number of reactor error suppression , but they also have some partial iso - flux matching hence benefiting from an extra up to @xmath150 error suppression so far neglected in @xmath0 publications . both full - reactor power ( dashed lines ) and a simplified refuelling scenario ( solid lines ) are shown , while the latter is expected to be a more accurate description of the reality . in the refuelling scenario , dc - ii benefits from the null reactor flux error whenever only one reactor is running , while reno and db have the expected opposite trend . ]",
    "the sf(correlation ) term has the potential to provide further flux systematic error suppression , regardless of the reactor site geometry , in the ( unexpected ) limit of full correlation across reactors , sf@xmath210 since the sf(correlation ) term cancels , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - all_1d ] . assessing",
    "the correlation among reactor errors is a difficult subject , having today no specific common prescription or consensus .",
    "thus the only existing consensus is to adopt the most conservative scenario , implying two distinct cases :    single - detector case : : :    maximal sf(total ) is obtained if _ total correlation of reactor errors _    is assumed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dc_0near_2d ] .",
    "this is because both    sf(correlation ) and sf(@xmath16 ) terms provide no error    suppression ; i.e. sf=1 each .",
    "this the scenario is assumed for all dc - i    publications and all single detector experiments , unless otherwise    proved , thus affecting all past and and most future experiments .",
    "multi - detector case : : :    maximal sf(total ) is obtained if _ total uncorrelation of reactor    errors _ is assumed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dc_1near_2d]-right .",
    "this    implies sf(correlation)=1 and    sf(@xmath16)=@xmath18 , hence benefiting    from maximal sf(@xmath16 ) reduction .",
    "this is the scenario    expected to be assumed by db , dc - ii and reno , until otherwise proved .    of course , reactor errors are unlikely to be neither totally correlated or totally uncorrelated .",
    "the fact that only those extreme cases are considered in the literate is a mere demonstration of the lack of knowledge for a better handling . beyond the current debate among experts on the subject , the promising exploitation of sf(correlation ) will require strong reactor - type dependences to be accounted and justified carefully by each experiment in dedicated publications",
    "this means that each experiment will have to analyse their respective reactors , thus providing insight evidence of the error correlation behaviour .",
    "the thermal power contribution , typically indicated by @xmath8 , depends mainly on the uncertainty analysis of the internal reactor instrumentation data used for power estimation , as provided by the reactor running company .",
    "instead , the fission fraction evolution , indicated by @xmath22 , depends mainly on the simulation uncertainties analysis , including the assumptions and input parameters ( fuel configuration , etc ) used for the modelling and time evolution .",
    "both the instrumentation and simulations are very specific to each reactor type and , therefore , to the each experiment .",
    "therefore , dedicated analyses are needed by each experiment to justify the delicate exploitation of sf(correlation ) , in the same way that this publication aims to illustrates the realisation of the unprecedented sf(iso - flux ) exploitation . as a consequence of the unsettled complications behind the assessment of sf(correlation ) for each experiment , our description here remains generic in its description , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - all_1d ] , nonetheless , we illustrate and quantify the rationale behind for error suppression and its promising exploitation potential .",
    "our approach is also consistent with the fact that none of the @xmath0 experiments have so far provided detailed publications on the non - trivial reactor systematics analyses , including the quantitative justification of all assumptions used so far . in the context of the @xmath0 experiments ,",
    "a few references exist dc  @xcite and db@xcite ( nothing yet available for reno ) illustrating a fraction of their reactor flux studies , but not dealing with the inter - reactor error correlation needed for the exploitation of sf(correction ) .",
    "dc is , however , finalising a dedicated publication  @xcite on their reactor flux systematics quoted so far .",
    "thus , reactor flux error critical subject , despite its major impact to the final precision on @xmath0 , remains unfortunately somewhat obscure in today s literature .",
    "as time goes , the statistical error of reactor experiments is no longer dominant , the treatment of the systematics should be clearly laid well in advance to maximise the stability and reliability of the @xmath0 measurement , whose impact has critical implication transcending reactor neutrino results , affecting , for example , current searches for neutrino cp - violation .",
    "this publication provides reactor neutrino experiments with a coherent treatment for reactor flux systematic uncertainty for multi - detector experiments in multi - reactor contributions .",
    "we started with careful treatment of the single detector in a single reactor site scenario , being the most relevant case for most reactor experiments beyond @xmath0 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the challenging reactor flux systematic do not trivially cancel by the adoption of that multi - detector experiments .",
    "however , we have identified several means for error suppression in the context of double chooz , daya bay and reno experiments , using simplified scenarios to maximise relative comparison .",
    "we computed an integral error _ suppression fraction _",
    "( sf ) , which can be broken down into three components , defined as sf(total)@xmath15sf(iso - flux)@xmath17sf(@xmath16)@xmath17sf(correlation ) , where sf(@xmath16 ) suppresses the uncorrelated error of identical reactors , sf(iso - flux ) suppresses the total error if the site geometry meets fully , or partially , the iso - flux condition and sf(correlation ) suppresses the error if the reactor errors are fully correlated .",
    "sf(iso - flux ) and sf(correlation ) could lead to total cancellation of the flux error .",
    "however , only sf(@xmath16 ) has been exploited to improve the @xmath0 precision , although total cancellation is impossible .",
    "this publication deals in detail on the calculation for sf(iso - flux ) , thus paving the ground for its exploitation , yielding two important observations .",
    "first , dc , once in its near+far configuration , is the only experiment expected to benefit from a negligible reactor flux error , thanks to the @xmath190% iso - flux error suppression .",
    "second , daya bay and reno could also benefit from their partial iso - flux , thus yielding up to @xmath150% flux error suppression .",
    "thus , this publication embodies a major improvement in the global precision of @xmath0 by improving the precision of all experiments measuring it , including current results .",
    "finally , we have highlighted the potential for a mechanism , currently neglected , for error suppression relying on further reactor error correlation insight , characterised by the sf(correlation ) term , further improving the precision of all multi - detector experiments .",
