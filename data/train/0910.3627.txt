    "if the next - generation reactor- and accelerator - based experiments fail to observe any positive signal for non - zero @xmath1 , more powerful experiments will be needed .",
    "in addition to this , even if the forthcoming experiments could measure @xmath1 , it is quite unlikely that they will obtain neither a cp violating signal nor a measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , a new generation of experiments will be needed also in this case .",
    "two main options have been envisaged for this purpose : the neutrino factory @xcite , and the so - called `` @xmath0-beam '' @xcite . while the former produces the ( anti)neutrino beams through muon decay , the latter entails producing @xmath0-unstable radioactive ions and letting them decay in a storage ring .",
    "we propose a @xmath0-beam  set - up where we produce , accelerate and store ions of the four kinds ( @xmath3he  , @xmath2ne  , @xmath6li  and @xmath6b  @xmath13 ) at cern , each of them running for a period of 2.5 years .",
    "we aim the @xmath3he  - and @xmath2ne  -generated low - energy neutrino beams to a megaton water detector located at @xmath5 km from the source , and the @xmath6li  - and @xmath6b  -generated high - energy neutrino beams to a 50 kton iron detector at a distance close to the magic baseline .",
    "we have also reconsidered the storage ring design and feasibility : as we consider different ions for the two baselines , we have reduced the size of the ring that is aiming at the far detector , increasing at the same time the @xmath14 factor for the @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  ions in order not to lose sensitivity to the main observables we are interested in .",
    "it is well - known that for a baseline of _ o _  @xmath15 , all the @xmath16-dependent terms in the golden channel probability vanish  @xcite .",
    "this provides a clean bedrock to determine @xmath1 , because the intrinsic degeneracy disappears .",
    "in addition to this , the density encountered by the ( anti)neutrinos at this baseline allows for a resonant enhancement in the probability when @xmath17  gev if the mass hierarchy is normal ( inverted ) .",
    "the advantage of this resonance is two - fold : first , it compensates the loss of events due to the very long baseline ; second , it only occurs for ( anti)neutrinos if the mass hierarchy is normal ( inverted ) , therefore providing an extremely good probe of the mass ordering . in order to reach this range of energies ,",
    "@xmath6b  and @xmath6li  ions are the best candidates because of their high end point energies",
    ".    however , @xmath16 can not be measured at the magic baseline , and matter effects can fake true cp violation .",
    "therefore , short baselines are better if we want to probe @xmath16 . in the small matter effect regime",
    ", maximizing the cp - violating terms translates into fixing @xmath18 km / gev .",
    "the mean neutrino energy of neutrinos coming from @xmath3he and @xmath2ne decays at @xmath19 is @xmath20  gev , which translates to an on - peak baseline of @xmath21  km , while for @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  , due to their much higher end point energies , this baseline would be @xmath22 km .",
    "the main problem in this case is that the flux is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , @xmath3he  and @xmath2ne  turn out to be the better candidates to probe cp violation .",
    "the original design of the storage ring proposed in @xcite must be modified when the boost factor @xmath14 is increased .",
    "if we use lhc dipolar magnets ( with a maximum magnetic field of 8.3 t ) to bend the ions , and keeping the straight sections untouched , the useful fraction of ion decays ( also called  livetime \" ) for this ring would be ] _",
    "= 0.28 , the total length of the decay ring being @xmath24 m. the tilt angle needed to aim at a detector located at 650 km from the source is @xmath25 : this means that the maximum depth of the far end of the ring is @xmath26 m.    however , if a ring of the same type is used to aim at a detector located at @xmath27 km from the source , the tilt angle to be considered is @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", the maximum depth of the far end of the ring is @xmath29 m , something well beyond any realistic possibility . in our proposal ,",
    "two different storage rings will be used to aim to the detectors .",
    "therefore , it is possible to design two rings of different characteristics and reduce the size of the ring that is aiming at the far detector .    note that with the refurbished sps ( sps+ ) the @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  ions could be accelerated up to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . due to the resonance ,",
    "a @xmath32 increase in the @xmath14 factor for @xmath6li  produces an increase of a @xmath33 in the number of antineutrino events at the detector .",
    "therefore , we can use a ring with a much shorter straight section , @xmath34 m and the physics reach of the setup will remain practically unaffected , in spite of the fact that it will have a lower livetime _",
    "= @xmath35 . the maximum depth",
    "this ring would reach is @xmath36 m , which is still much larger than what is needed for the neutrino factory but is almost 1 km less deep than in the original design .",
    "we make the following choices for our detectors : ( 1 ) since cp measurements are better at lower energies with @xmath2ne  and @xmath3he  as source ions @xcite , it is preferable to have a detector with lower threshold and good energy resolution .",
    "we opt for a water detector with 500 kton fiducial mass ( as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . this detector could be housed at canfranc , for example , at a distance of 650 km from the @xmath0-beam at cern ; ( 2 ) mass hierarchy measurement is the main motivation for the experiment at the magic baseline , for which higher energy neutrinos from highly boosted @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  ions will be used .",
    "we prefer thus to use a 50 kton magnetized iron detector at this baseline",
    ". this far detector could be the ical@ino detector in india @xcite which is at a distance of 7152 km , and which will soon go under construction .",
    "the efficiencies and beam - induced backgrounds expected in a water detector for the @xmath19 @xmath0-beam fluxes from @xmath2ne  and @xmath3he  decays are given in @xcite as migration matrices that we use to simulate the detector .",
    "unfortunately , a similarly detailed analysis of the performance of the iron detector exposed to the @xmath0-beam fluxes is lacking .",
    "we therefore follow the efficiencies and backgrounds derived in @xcite for the neutrino factory fluxes instead .",
    "notice that this is a very conservative assumption , since for a @xmath0-beam  charge identification is not mandatory , unlike in the nf .",
    "therefore , we could take advantage of this and use the charge i d capability of the detector to further reduce the background .    finally , note that the largest uncertainties in the performance of the iron detector are on the efficiencies and backgrounds for the events of lowest energy , around @xmath37 gev",
    ". however , the main role of the iron detector is to observe the resonance in the probability , which takes place around @xmath38 gev , so these uncertainties will practically have no effect at all in the performance of the setup .",
    "we quantify the sensitivity reach of the experiments in terms of three different performance indicators :    1 .",
    "the @xmath39 discovery reach : this is the minimum true value of @xmath39 for which the experiment can rule out at the 1 d.o.f .",
    "@xmath40 the value @xmath41 in the fit , after marginalizing over all the other parameters . 2 .",
    "the cp - violation reach : this is the range of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath39 which can rule out no cp - violation ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) at the 1 d.o.f . @xmath40 , after marginalizing over all the other parameters .",
    "the @xmath44 reach in @xmath39 : this is defined as the limiting value of @xmath39 for which the wrong hierarchy can be eliminated at @xmath40 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] we present the comparison of our set - up with respect to other high @xmath14 @xmath0-beam  proposals , defined as follows :    1 .",

    "neutrino beams from decay of @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  with boost factor @xmath19 , are detected in two 50 kton magnetized iron detector located at 2000 km and 7000 km respectively .",
    "3 .   orange , dashed lines : the two - baseline @xmath0-beam  set - up proposed in  @xcite . here",

    "purple , dot - dashed lines : the one - baseline @xmath0-beam  set - up proposed in  @xcite .",
    "neutrino beams produced by @xmath2ne  and @xmath3he  decays , each accelerated to @xmath47 are detected in a 500 kton water detector located at 650 km .",
    "the original @xmath0-beam proposals assumed `` standard '' useful fluxes of @xmath48 and @xmath49 decays per year for @xmath2ne  and @xmath3he  respectively .",
    "similar standard numbers regarding @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  are lacking . at present , @xmath6li  and @xmath3he  can be easily produced with the standard isolde techniques .",
    "@xmath6b  is easily produced , but it tends to interact with the medium nearby .",
    "finally , @xmath2ne  production is still difficult , and we are far from the original goal of @xmath48 ions per year .",
    "preliminary studies on the production rates of @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  show that it could be enhanced in the near future .",
    "@xmath0-beams are facilities under study for construction in the next two decades .",
    "therefore , we will assume that @xmath50 ions per year can be stored into the ring , for all ion species@xcite .",
    "note that for the `` standard '' storage ring considered in set - ups 2 , 3 and 4 , the livetime is _ l _ = 0.28 , what translates into _ @xmath51 useful decays per year _ per polarity .",
    "however , for our proposal , the storage ring for the @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  ions is shorter , giving a 40% smaller livetime .",
    "we have considered 2.5% and 5% systematic errors on the signal and on the beam - induced background , respectively .",
    "they have been included as `` pulls '' in the statistical @xmath52 analysis .",
    "the following @xmath53 errors for the oscillation parameters were also considered : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "eventually , an error @xmath58 has been considered for the earth density given by the prem model @xcite .",
    "marginalization over these parameters has been performed for all observables .",
    "the globes 3.0 @xcite software was used to perform the numerical analysis .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : senscpf ] the comparison of the performance of our setup with the ids neutrino factory design @xcite and the high-@xmath14 @xmath0-beam  set - up 4 , described above . in this case",
    "we present the sensitivities to the observables as a function of the fraction of the values of @xmath16 for which they can be discovered instead of the true values of @xmath16 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : senscpf ] it is clear that the facility with sensitivity to the different observables down to smallest values of @xmath39 is the neutrino factory .",
    "this can be understood from the very large fluxes assumed for the ids baseline as compared to the ones assumed here for the @xmath0-beam set - ups : @xmath59 useful muon decays per year and per baseline to be compared to the @xmath51 assumed for the @xmath0-beams . on the other hand , the high energy of the neutrino factory beams implies a very small value of @xmath60 .",
    "this translates into a stronger suppression of the cp violating term of the oscillation probability with respect to the one suppressed by two powers of @xmath1 for large values of this parameter .",
    "therefore , the cp discovery potential of @xmath0-beams outperforms that of the neutrino factory in fig .",
    "[ fig : senscpf ] when @xmath61 .",
    "since this large value of @xmath62 also guarantees a discovery of the mass hierarchy and @xmath39 regardless of the value of @xmath16 , this makes @xmath0-beams the better option when @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , even if the statistics in the near @xmath0-beam detector is reduced by half in our proposal compared to the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cp - discovery potential for @xmath61 is better in the two - baseline set - up due to the lifting of the degeneracies that can mimic cp - conservation when combining the information from the two detectors .",
    "we have presented a new @xmath0-beam set - up that combines the strengths of the best set - ups in the literature , trying to probe with the same facility @xmath1 , the existence of leptonic cp - violation and the neutrino mass ordering in the challenging regime of small @xmath1 .    in order to achieve good sensitivity to the cp phase , we have chosen the highest @xmath14 accesible at the sps+ but exploiting the decay of the ions with smallest end - point energy .",
    "this guarantees good statistics at the detector , since the flux and cross sections grow with @xmath14 , while maintaining the mean energy around @xmath63  gev , which allows to consider a water detector .",
    "furthermore , the oscillation baseline can be kept short , so as to further increase the statistics and to avoid strong matter effects that could spoil the cp discovery potential .    on the other hand , to achieve sensitivity to the mass hierarchy ,",
    "a far detector located at the magic baseline is mandatory . for this detector",
    ", ions with higher end - point energies are preferred , and higher @xmath14 values help to increase the statistics . as for this case",
    "the neutrino fluxes are peaked around @xmath64  gev , we opted for an iron detector .",
    "while two - baseline @xmath0-beam  set - ups have been proposed and studied before , our proposal is unique .",
    "we propose two different racetrack geometry decay rings , as we use different ions for the two baselines .",
    "we have kept the initial design for the ring that is aiming at the near detector .",
    "however , the @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  beam has to be sent over a baseline @xmath7 km , and hence its storage ring requires an inclination of @xmath8 . this would require a maximum depth @xmath9 m at the far end of the storage ring if we use the same design . in order to alleviate this problem ,",
    "one necessarily has to reduce the size of the straight sections of the ring that is aiming to the far detector . to compensate for the consequent loss in the number of events due to this reduction",
    ", we propose to increase the @xmath14 for the @xmath6b  and @xmath6li  ions .",
    "we have also made a full comparison with the rest of proposed facilities . while the presently assumed @xmath0-beam fluxes can not compete with the expectations from a neutrino factory and can not probe values of @xmath1 much smaller than @xmath65 , we find that @xmath0-beam set - ups are better optimized for regions with @xmath66 , providing sensitivity to the different observables in larger fractions of the parameter space .",
    "we believe that the combination of ions and baselines proposed here represents an optimal @xmath0-beam  set - up , that takes advantage of the properties of the different achievable beams , with very good sensitivity to all of the three observables considered .",
