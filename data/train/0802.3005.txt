    "in general , extinction is obtained by comparing the transmitted power of the probe with and without the sample in the optical path of the probe . in usual extinction measurements ,",
    "e.g. as implemented in a commercial spectrophotometer , the probe beam is collected fully by the power measuring device . however , this is not the case in the extinction measurements on single quantum systems reported so far , e.g. in@xcite .",
    "the reason is that substantial extinction of a probe beam by single quantum systems generally requires strong focusing .",
    "it is , nevertheless , difficult if not impossible in most experiments to collect the strongly diverging probe fully after the focus . as such ,",
    "the ` extinction ' measured in such experiments is not the extinction in the usual sense and can not be used in a straightforward way to quantify the actual scattering probability of the probe by the quantum system without further model assumptions . in our experiment",
    ", we collect all of the diverging probe light , and thus are able to carry out a _ direct _ extinction measurement .",
    "the measured transmission @xmath59 is related to the scattering probability @xmath60 by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 represents the percentage of scattered light collected by the transmitted power detector .",
    "the extinction @xmath63 is thus related to the scattering probability by @xmath64 .",
    "the collection efficiency @xmath62 in this experiment is estimated to be less 5% , so @xmath65 .",
    "we carefully quantified the losses in the transmission channel to make sure our results do not suffer from interference artefacts ( interference between partially collected probe and scattered light can lead to value of extinction larger than the scattering probability ) .",
    "the total transmission from point a in fig .",
    "[ img : setup ] ( before the vacuum chamber ) to point b ( after the single - mode fiber and just before the detector ) is 53% .",
    "the 47% loss include 21.6% loss from the four uncoated window surfaces of the vacuum chamber and the two aspheric lenses ; 5.3% loss over two dichroic mirrors , an interference filter ( peak transmission @xmath59=96% at 780 nm ) and a mirror ; and 28.4% coupling loss into an uncoated single mode fiber .",
    "all the losses are caused by reflection except for 20% loss at the fiber coupling that is due to imperfect mode matching .",
    "since the scattered field and the probe field should experience the same reflection loss at each surface , we are reasonably confident that our results are free from interference artefacts .",
    "once an atom is loaded into the fort , it triggers the transmission measurement sequence .",

    "switching on the mot beams to check whether the atom is still in the fort by monitoring fluorescence with detector d2 ; if `` yes '' , turn off the mot beams and repeat step 3 and 4 ; step 6 .",
    "otherwise , recording the photo counts @xmath70 of the transmitted probe beam with detector d1 for @xmath71s without an atom in the trap for reference ; step 7 . turning on the mot beams and the quadrupole coil current , waiting for another atom to be loaded in the fort .    a transmission value @xmath59 is obtained for each atom trapping event by @xmath72 , where the summation is carried over all contiguous measurement intervals @xmath73 for which an atom was found in the trap .",
    "the average time an atom stays in the fort is about 1.5s .",
    "a single data point in figure [ img : transmission ] is the average of about 100 of such transmission values , each weighted by @xmath74 .",
    "the error is dominated by photo counting shot noise , our error bars indicate @xmath75 standard deviation . during the transmission measurement process",

    "<S> these protocols consider quantum states of localized carriers ( nodes ) like atoms , ions , or even atomic ensembles , that exchange information through a quantum channel with help of `` flying '' qubits ( photons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum channels can be implemented via well - defined photonic modes that couple the nodes with high efficiency . </S>",

    "<S> , one could consider an interface between stationary and flying qubits in a simpler free - space configuration , where the quantum channel is defined e.g. by a gaussian mode of a single mode optical fiber , and a single atom is strongly coupled to this mode with help of a large numerical aperture lens . indeed , the common model describing the interaction of a monochromatic plane wave with a two - level atom predicts a scattering cross section of @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> we would expect to observe the largest extinction for a clean two - level system with no other decay channels . </S>",

    "<S> for such a low scattering rate , however , we need to ensure that the atom does not leave the cycling transition between subsequent photon scattering events . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field orthogonal to the quantization axis causes the atom to undergo larmor precession , leaking population from @xmath24 or @xmath25 to other @xmath26 , @xmath27 states , which upsets the clean two level system . to prevent this , we carefully zero the magnetic field at the location of the trapped atom , and then apply a magnetic bias field along the quantization axis during the measurement . </S>",

    "<S> the two spectra of a single @xmath0rb atom were obtained for @xmath32 and @xmath35 probes , while keeping the handedness of the fort beam fixed . as expected , the atomic resonance frequency is different for the two probe polarizations , and agrees very well with prediction shown in figure [ img : levelscheme ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentzian fit to the transmission spectrum for the @xmath35 probe shows a maximum extinction of @xmath44 with a full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath45mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 probe gives a maximum extinction of @xmath46 with a fwhm of @xmath47mhz . </S>",
    "<S> from the fact that the d2 transition of @xmath0rb has a natural linewidth of 6.0mhz and that the linewidth / stability of the probe laser is about 1mhz , we conclude that an atom exposed to the @xmath35 probe has been successfully kept in a two - level cycling transition , and it experiences very small spectral broadening caused by position dependent ac stark shift in the fort . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same conclusion can not be made for the atom exposed to a @xmath32 probe . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation is that optical pumping by the @xmath32 probe is less effective because a probe frequency resonant to the @xmath48 to @xmath49 transition is further detuned from the resonant frequencies of other @xmath50 to @xmath51 transitions , whereas the resonance frequency of @xmath52 to @xmath53 is less detuned from other transitions ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ img : levelscheme ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a fort wavelength of 980 nm forms a repulsive potential for the 5p@xmath54 levels of the @xmath0rb atom . as the energy of @xmath49 is higher than that of the @xmath53 , an atom in @xmath49 experiences a stronger repulsive force from the fort on average . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , a trapped @xmath0rb atom might be more susceptible to increase of kinetic energy under the @xmath32 probe , and thus oscillates more strongly around the focus .    </S>",
    "<S> coming back to the photon - atom coupling efficiency , we want to emphasize that an extinction of 9.8% observed for a probe focused to @xmath55 nm waist@xcite is large when compared to results reported from experiments performed on single molecules and quantum dots@xcite . there , </S>",
    "<S> the excitation light field was either confined with a small aperture of @xmath56nm@xcite , or focused by using solid immersion lenses@xcite that provide much tighter focusing than in our case . in all these experiments </S>",
    "<S> quantum systems were embedded into complex solid state host environments which complicates the theoretical treatment of light scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the conceptual simplicity of the system we investigate and the fact that we directly measure the extinction of the probe beam allows a clean comparison with existing photon - atom coupling models@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the models that closely describes our experiment was presented by van enk and kimble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it considers a monochromatic and circularly polarized gaussian beam focused by an ideal thin lens onto a two - level atomic system . </S>",
    "<S> estimations based on that model gave a very dim outlook on the effectiveness of coupling light to an atom using a lens . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a direct application of the method described there predicts a maximum scattering probability of 2.2% for our experimental parameters . </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out , two approximations adopted in the model ( parabolic wave front after the lens , and no change to the polarization of a light beam passing through the lens ) has greatly underestimated scattering probability for stronger focusing . dropping these approximations , we find ( with otherwise same methods ) a scattering probability of 20.3% for our experimental parameters@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the residual difference between the predicted and measured values could be both due to the imperfections of our aspheric lens , and the fact that the atom is not completely stationary at the focus . applying this model for an even tighter focus , a very high scattering probability of up to 95% </S>",
    "<S> is predicted ( for focusing na@xmath57 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a high scattering probability is at odd with other photon - atom coupling models which suggest a maximum scattering probability of 50% for a light beam focused by a lens as in our setup@xcite ; further experimental work is required to check this discrepancy .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we experimentally observed a substantial extinction of a weak coherent light field by a single atom by focusing the light beam using a lens . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a coupling efficiency of at least 9.8% has been achieved with a focused beam waist of @xmath58 m . </S>",
    "<S> such values might appear to be small compared to the maximum achievable with the help of a cavity . in practice , however , due to mode - matching issues and other passive losses , achieving very good coupling of light into a high finesse cavity is nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> this problem reduces the overall photon - atom coupling efficiency between a truly flying qubit and an atom when using a cavity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contrary , a lens system suffers much less from reflection losses . </S>",
    "<S> this advantage , together with the simplicity of such configuration would make such a photon - atom coupling scheme very appealing to many applications involving quantum state transfer from photons to atoms . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the strong interaction of the atom with a flying qubit suggests using the atom as a mediator for a photon - photon interactions , pointing in a new direction for implementing photonic quantum gates . </S>"
