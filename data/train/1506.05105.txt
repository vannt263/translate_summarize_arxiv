    "tremendous efforts have been made to understand the symmetry - protected gapped topological phases after the discovery of topological insulators @xcite . following this progress ,",
    "various theoretical and experimental studies have begun to explore the gapless analogs of symmetry - protected topological phases such as the dirac @xcite and weyl semi - metal @xcite , where low energy excitations possess dirac - like spectra .",
    "recently , three - dimensional materials with symmetry - protected fermi line nodes have also been theoretically proposed and experimentally synthesized @xcite .",
    "these systems have nodal rings in momentum space protected by various combinations of time reversal invariance , inversion , chiral and other lattice symmetries .",
    "these non - trivial systems are predicted to host topologically protected surface states .",
    "however , so far no efforts have been made to study the effects of interactions .    in this study , we investigate the effects of the long - range coulomb interaction in nodal ring semi - metals .",
    "this is known in various other fermion systems . in the best - studied system ,",
    "the fermi liquid metal , @xmath1-long range interaction is marginal , but fermi liquid survives due to the strong thomas - fermi screening which makes the coulomb interaction effectively short - ranged .",
    "this is caused by metals having an extended fermi surface and a constant density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the results are known in the other limit , where the energy vanishes only at isolated points of the brillouin zone .",
    "graphene ( in two - dimensions ) , weyl semi - metals ( in three - dimensions ) and double weyl semi - metals receive logarithmic corrections due to the coulomb interaction that remains marginal @xcite . in the quadratic band",
    "touching case , a non - fermi liquid phase was found @xcite . for anisotropic weyl fermions ,",
    "the coulomb interaction becomes anisotropic and irrelevant @xcite .",
    "nodal ring semi - metals lie in between these two well - studied limits .",
    "the energy gap closes on a one - dimensional line node , on which the density of states vanishes . because of this",
    ", short - range interaction was found to be irrelevant @xcite .",
    "screening of the coulomb interaction is expected to be much weaker compared to the fermi liquid metal , because fewer states are available to participate .",
    "nonetheless , we show below that the coulomb interaction is relevant at the non - interacting fixed point . through renormalization group ( rg ) analysis and large-@xmath0 computations",
    ", we identify a non - trivial interacting fixed point where the partially - screened coulomb interaction becomes irrelevant , making the fermions asymptotically free in the low energy limit .",
    "this allows us to treat the partially - screened coulomb interaction as a perturbation and calculate the lifetime of the quasiparticles .",
    "it is found that the quasiparticle scattering rate vanishes as @xmath2 at low energies even though the partially - screened coulomb interaction is still long - ranged .",
    "we start with a non - interacting effective hamiltonian for the nodal ring semi - metal .",
    "this can be written as @xmath3 where the pauli matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the orbital or pseudo - spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this hamiltonian is similar to that of ref  .",
    "this system has a nodal fermi ring in the @xmath6 plane of radius @xmath7 , and a linear dispersion in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "its energy spectrum is @xmath9 for the empty @xmath10 and filled @xmath11 bands . in order to describe the effects of coulomb interaction , we use the euclidean path integral formalism for the action in @xmath12 dimensions .",

    "here we use an rg scheme where a momentum cutoff is applied in the directions around the fermi ring .",
    "we scale the fermion momentum towards the fermi ring @xcite ; @xmath7 is fixed and scaling is done only in the dirac dimensions in which there are linear dispersions . using definitions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath8 are scaled .",
    "however there is no scaling in the angular ( @xmath18 direction since this represents the gapless degree of freedom .",
    "because of this anisotropy , it is easier to calculate the scaling dimensions from an action written in momentum space rather than in the form given in eq .",
    "[ eq : action1 ] . here",
    "we generalize the expression to general @xmath19-spacial dimensions and write the coulomb interaction as a 4-fermion term .",
    "@xmath20 we have used the notation @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the constants that have no scaling dimensions such as @xmath7 and @xmath24 have been dropped for clarity . note that while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are scaled only in the dirac directions with @xmath27 dimensions , @xmath28 is scaled in all @xmath19 dimensions .",
    "this is because the important contribution arises from when the momentum carried by the coulomb interaction is small and when the fermions are close to the fermi ring .",
    "the scaling dimensions can be found to be @xmath29 = 1 $ ] , @xmath30 = 1 $ ] , @xmath31 = 1 $ ] , @xmath32=1 $ ] , @xmath33 = -(d+1)/2 $ ] , and @xmath34 = 3-d$ ] .",
    "therefore the critical dimension is the physical dimension @xmath35 . from this",
    "we would conclude that the coulomb interaction to be marginal .",

    "we find @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "this is infrared ( ir ) divergent as @xmath55 and the coulomb interaction is strongly renormalized .      after a step of eliminating high energy degrees of freedom ,",
    "the boson propagator @xmath70 can be written as @xmath71 therefore the anomalous dimension is @xmath72 which arises from the existence of a @xmath7 scale .",
    "the renormalized propagator at the new interacting fixed point satisfies @xmath73 this will be confirmed by a direct calculation below .",
    "the screened coulomb interaction in @xmath35 can also be directly calculated using the random phase approximation .",
    "this can be viewed as a large @xmath0 calculation where @xmath0 is the number of fermion flavors .",
    "the physical case is @xmath74 for the spin states . after introducing a sum over fermion flavors and modifying the coupling constant to @xmath75 , the same eqs .",
    "[ eq : pi ] and [ eq : pi2 ] are calculated without the @xmath76 expansions or the @xmath77 cutoffs .",
    "the result is @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 are calculated numerically .",
    "( details of the calculation are presented in the supplemental material . )",
    "therefore for a small @xmath81 , the screened coulomb potential is @xmath82 notice that the screened coulomb interaction still has algebraic momentum dependence @xmath83 in sharp contrast to that of fermi liquids .",
    "the presence of @xmath7 in nodal ring excitation is not enough to make the coulomb interaction short - ranged .",
    "furthermore , the directional dependence is qualitatively the same even though the nodal ring spectrum is strongly anisotropic .",
    "it is important to note that this result is independent of choice in rg scheme since no cutoff has been imposed .",
    "the rg calculation is a weak coupling analysis whereas this is a strong coupling analysis with @xmath84 as a control parameter .",
    "however this result is still consistent with the rg result presented in eq .",
    "[ eq : screenedcoulombrg ] , which provides validity to both .",
    "the imaginary part of the bosonic self energy determines the decay .",
    "this can be calculated by performing a wick rotation .",
    "this gives the results @xmath85 ( full expressions are presented in the supplmental material . ) therefore there is no damping in the direction perpendicular to the ring , while the boson with in - plane momentum shows damping less than that of the fermi liquid .",
    "landau damping , for comparison , gives @xmath86 .",
    "the vertex correction vanishes at the one loop level .",
    "this can be easily checked by setting all the external momenta and frequency to @xmath87 .",
    "this is as required by the ward identity because the fermion self energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diags1](b ) ) has no frequency dependence .",
    "and the double wiggly line represents the renormalized boson propagator . , width=151 ]",
    "we have seen above that the bosons are strongly renormalized .",
    "however since the screened coulomb interaction is still long - ranged , we must check whether the interaction destroys the fermi liquid or not .",
    "the fate of the quasiparticles can be determined from the self energy of the fermions . using the renormalized boson propagator as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags2 ] , the self energy is @xmath88 we find that this is both uv and ir convergent and therefore the screened coulomb interaction is an irrelevant perturbation to the fermions .",
    "therefore the fermions remain as valid quasiparticles of the system and are effectively decoupled .",
    "the result is again consistent with the rg analysis presented earlier .",
    "the lifetime of these fermions can be found from the imaginary part of the self energy after analytic continuation by the relation @xmath89 .",
    "the channel that has the largest contribution is the one that satisfies the fermi s golden rule . focusing on this channel , for a fermion with initial momentum",
    "@xmath90 close to the line node and energy @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 leading order contributions only come from the region where the intermediate wave vector @xmath77 is very close to the nodal ring . in fact , @xmath77 needs to be closer to the ring than @xmath76 is to the origin .",
    "we find that @xmath93 where @xmath94 controls the in - plane component versus the out - of - plane component of @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath95 is a numerical factor that can be numerically calculated for any @xmath94 .",
    "( details of this calculation can be found in the appendix . )",
    "it is identically zero when the in - plane component disappears .",
    "this is because there is no decay channel that satisfies the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "this can be seen above by @xmath96 when @xmath52 is small .",
    "overall , @xmath97 and therefore the quasiparticles are long - lived .",
    "interestingly it has the same energy dependence as the fermi liquid case .",
    "while the density of states of this system is vanishing at the fermi level ( @xmath98 ) , this is compensated by the partially screened coulomb potential .",
    "similar to surface acoustic wave propagation experiments in two - dimensional materials @xcite , a bulk sound wave propagation measurement in a periodic potential with wavelength @xmath99 can be used to probe the momentum dependence of the dielectric function . the sound velocity shift and attenuation",
    "is found as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath61 is the coupling constant between the piezoelectrics and medium which depends on the geometry .",
    "in contrast , in the fermi liquid metal , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "a related physical observable is the dc conductivity . using the kubo formula and taking the limits @xmath105 , then @xmath106 , we find the dc conductivity in the clean limit to be finite ( due to the underlying particle - hole symmetry ) and anisotropic : @xmath107 and @xmath108 with restored units",
    ". these results are consistent with a previous compuatation for a similar system @xcite .",
    "the characteristic screening of the coulomb interaction also affects the phonon dispersion .",
    "longitudinal acoustic phonon dispersion follows @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the plasma frequency of the ions .",
    "this shows an unusual @xmath111 dependence for small @xmath28 .",
    "it is shown that the long - range coulomb interaction in nodal ring semi - metals leads to a non - trivial fixed point where the screened coulomb interaction acquires an anomalous dimension .",
    "on the other hand , the screened coulomb interaction becomes irrelevant at the interacting fixed point while remaining long - ranged .",
    "hence the quasi - particles are asymptotically free and physical properties can be computed using a perturbation theory .",
    "we show that the quasi - particles have a long life time even though the screening of charged impurity potential would follow an unusual power - law form due to the anomalous dimension .",
    "sound wave propagation and acoustic phonon dispersion show unique momentum dependences .",
    "anisotropic dc conductivity is found and is proportional to the size of the nodal ring .",
