    "figure [ scanning_initialc_82003a](b ) shows the consitituent radiated power losses in the case of the simulation with @xmath142 .",
    "it can be seen that the radiation is dominated in turn by the radiated power loss from deuterium , carbon , oxygen , and beryllium .",

    "figure [ figure6 ] compares the townsend criterion and the criterion for plasma burn - through .",
    "the cyan lines in figure [ figure6 ] are the minimum electric field for electron avalanche @xmath1 for effective connection lengths @xmath3 in jet , drawn analytically by using the townsend criterion in .",
    "the townsend criterion shows that there is an optimum range of the prefill gas pressure at which the lowest toroidal electric field is available for electron avalanche .",
    "however , for successful tokamak start - up , operation space is not only determined by the townsend criterion , but also by the criterion for plasma burn - through .",
    "the black , red , and blue lines in figure [ figure6 ] represent the required electric field for plasma burn - through @xmath148 without or with impurities , obtained using dyon simulation results .",
    "the models described in section [ reviewofpsimodelsforcarbonwall ] and [ newpsimodelsforiter - likewall ] are used for the dyon simulations .",
    "plasma parameters assumed for the dyon simulation are indicated in table [ defaultvalues ] .",
    "the criterion for plasma burn - through is computed from the numerical simulations using several assumptions , subject to wall conditions and operation scenario .",
    "however , the simulation results provide informative insight on the operation space .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure6 ] , the required electric field for plasma burn - through increases monotonically as prefill gas pressure rises since the rib is greater at a high prefill gas pressure .",
    "this monotonic increase with prefill gas pressure is consistent with , which is analytically derived for deuterium burn - through .",
    "if are included , the required electric field for plasma burn - through increases , thereby reducing the operation space available . as can be seen in figure [ figure5 ] ,",
    "the rib for carbon burn - through is much greater than for deuterium burn - through .",
    "hence , the required loop voltage in the carbon wall is significantly higher than for a pure deuterium plasma .",
    "this results in the smaller operation space available in the carbon wall as shown in figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "however , the rib for beryllium burn - through is not significant in figures [ figure5 ] . with the beryllium wall ,",
    "the critical rib to be overcome is for deuterium rather than for beryllium this implies that lower loop voltage can be used for plasma burn - through in the iter - like wall i.e. larger operation space available compared to the carbon wall as shown in figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "the criterion for plasma burn - through in figure [ figure6 ] can change with different assumptions in the dyon code .",
    "that is , the increase in required loop voltage with increasing prefill gas pressure is steeper for higher recycling coefficient ( or sputtering yield ) or for higher ratio of the effective vessel volume to the plasma volume i.e. @xmath149 . in tokamaks , the recycling coefficients and",
    "the sputtering yields vary due to the effects of deuterium retention and impurity migration in the wall .",
    "in addition , @xmath149 , which is related to dynamic neutral gas fuelling from the ex - plasma volume , is also varying according to the operation scenario .",
    "hence , to find the precise operation space using the simulations , the information on the wall conditions and operation scenario in each shot should be specified .",
    "the investigation of plasma burn - through has been published only with 0d simulations @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "since the closed flux surfaces ( cfss ) are not established yet during the plasma burn - through phase at low plasma current , a 2d approach of numerical simulation is extremely difficult .",
    "fortunately , the results of dyon simulations , ( also 0d ) , show good agreement with jet data .",
    "this implies the assumption of a uniform temperature and density in a numerical simulation is reasonable to compute the gross energy and particle balances during the plasma burn - through phase .",
    "probably , this is due to the open field configurations during the plasma burn - through phase . with the open magnetic field lines",
    ", the parallel thermal conduction and particle diffusion would be significant . quantitative investigations on the profile effects of temperature and density will be interesting to confirm this .",
    "the deuterium recycling coefficient has a significant influence on plasma burn - through and the dynamics of deuterium recycling coefficient is different for the carbon wall and the iter - like wall .",
    "this probably results from the different retention of deuterium at the wall . in the carbon wall",
    ", deuterium is retained especially after disruptions , so that the simulation results using decay model of @xmath150 match well with jet data @xcite . however , in the iter - like wall , the dyon results using the growing model of @xmath150 shows good agreement with jet data .",
    "this might be due to the fact that most of attached deuterium , even after disruption event , are easily removed by pumping between discharges @xcite ( typically 30 @xmath7 40 minutes in jet ) .",
    "deuterium fuelling has a significant effect , and it should be confirmed for iter simulations .",
    "however , it might not be a critical issue for plasma burn - through if the fuelling is pre - programmed after about @xmath151 $ ] , when plasma burn - through is completed . as shown in figure [ scanning_fuelling_82003a ] , fuelling does not result in differences on plasma parameters during the plasma burn - through phase .",
    "as shown in figure [ scanning_initialc_82003a](b ) , the radiation barrier in the iter - like wall simulations is dominated by deuterium , carbon , and oxygen .",
    "the simulation results with @xmath152 show good agreement with experimental data",
    ". however , the simulation results with @xmath152 still show reasonable agreement in the other plasma paramters , i.e. @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath47 .",
    "in this article , key physics aspects in the plasma burn - through phase are investigated with the dyon code . the criterion for plasma burn - through",
    "is explained with the radiation and ionization barrier ( rib ) and the critical degree of ionization @xmath44 .    for iter - like wall simulations ,",
    "the modification of the model in the dyon code is described in detail , and the simulation results using the models are compared to jet data with the iter - like wall , and the simulation results show good agreement .",
    "the results of parameter scanning in dyon simulations show that the deuterium recycling coefficient significantly influences the gross energy and particle balance , and the simulation results with the growing model of @xmath31 show good agreement .",
    "this implies that during the plasma burn - through phase deuteriums are pumped out by the beryllium wall .",
    "second , third , the radiation barrier in the iter - like wall is dominated by deuterium and other impurities rather than beryllium",
    ". the initial carbon content does not influence on other plasma parameters significantly in the simulation results .",
    "fourth , in the case of jet with the iter - like wall , plasma burn - through is not affected by gas fuelling if the fuelling is pre - programed after 100 @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "the required electric field for deuterium burn - through is calculated by the dyon code , and it is compared to the townsend avalanche criterion .",
    "the limitations set by the burn - through criterion will reduce the operational space with respect to those only based on the townsend criterion for an electron avalanche .",
    "the operation space available for jet is computed for the carbon wall and the iter - like wall .",
    "the impurity effects result in a reduced operation space for the carbon wall compared to a pure deuterium plasma . however , the rib in the iter - like wall is not much higher than in a pure deuterium plasma .",
