    "moreover , they are observed in elliptical and spiral galaxies , making them an indispensible tool to support distances obtained by other methods ( such as cepheids , surface brightness fluctuations , the tully - fisher relation , sne ia ) , and to measure the kinematics of stellar populations whose surface brightness is too faint for absorption line spectroscopy .    for distance determination the planetary nebulae luminosity function ( pnlf )",
    "is normally modeled as having a universal shape that depends only on the absolute bright magnitude cutoff @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of pns with absolute magnitude @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "observationally , the cutoff magnitude @xmath6 has a quasi - universal value of @xmath10 with only a weak dependence on host galaxy metallicity expressed by the system s oxygen abundance , and which can be compensated for by a quadratic relation in @xmath11 $ ] @xcite . in practice",
    ", the pn magnitudes @xmath12 , after correcting for the interstellar reddening , are fitted to the model pnlf of eq .",
    "[ pnlfeqn ] convolved with the photometric error profile , yielding a value of the distance modulus @xcite .",
    "the absence of any systematic variations in @xmath6 and the pnlf shape has been verified in galaxies with significant population gradients , and among galaxies of different morphologies within galaxy clusters / groups up to virgo ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    this universality of the pnlf and the cutoff magnitude @xmath6 must be considered surprising , given that the pn luminosity in the @xmath3 \\lambda 5007 $ ] line depends on the mass and metallicity of the central star , as well as on the electron gas temperature , optical thickness and dust extinction of the surrounding nebula . indeed , some current semi - analytic simulations of the pnlf seem to be at odds with the observational trends .",
    "@xcite indicate small possible dependencies of @xmath6 on the total size of the pn population , on the time elapsed since the last episode of star formation , and on how optically thin the pns are ; concluding , however , that only careful studies would detect such effects in the observed pnlf .",
    "in contrast , more recent pnlf simulations by @xcite contradict the observed narrow spread in @xmath6 and predict large variations of several magnitudes depending on a variety of realistic star formation and evolution scenarios .",
    "so is the pnlf truly quasi - universal and its cutoff magnitude nearly independent of population age and metallicity ?",
    "pns are also important as test particles to study the kinematics and dark matter distribution in the halos of elliptical galaxies .",
    "since the pn population is expected to arise from the underlying galactic stellar distribution , their radial velocities can be used as effective kinematic tracers of the mass distribution . however , the required pn sample sizes are many 100s @xcite , or at least 100 or more in conjunction with absorption line spectroscopy , which has limited this application to only a few nearby galaxies @xcite . in recent simulations of disk galaxy mergers involving dark matter , stars , and gas , @xcite",
    "predict that the young stars formed in the merger have steeper density profiles and larger radial anisotropy than the old stars from the progenitor galaxies , and they argue that if the pns observed in elliptical galaxies were to correspond to the young population rather than to all stars in the simulations , their velocity dispersion profile would match the measured dispersion profiles of @xcite .",
    "so do pns really trace the stars and their kinematics in elliptical galaxies ?",
    "different stellar populations may have , and in general would have , different phase - space distributions in the same galaxy potential .",
    "the simplest approach for dynamical modelling , taking the pn velocities as a random sampling of the stellar velocities , is however valid only when the pn population properties and their kinematics are uncorrelated .",
    "except in special cases this also requires that the pnlf is independent of the stellar population .",
    "vice - versa , if there existed differences in the pnlf or the bright cutoff magnitude for different stellar populations , they would best be identified by studying the correlations between pn magnitudes and kinematics or positions of these tracers , in a single galaxy where all pns are at the same distance .    in this paper",
    ", we report on such a study in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4697 , an excellent target for this purpose because of the large sample of pn velocities known from @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows the existence of distinct pn populations which differ in their kinematics , brightnesses , and spatial distributions .",
    "this suggests that the answer to both the questions posed above may be no  in general , different stellar populations may have slightly different pnlfs , and the observed pn population in elliptical galaxies may not be a fair tracer of their stars . the paper is organised as follows : in   [ data ] we review the properties and pn data of this galaxy and discuss the magnitude and velocity completeness of our sample .",
    "our statistical analysis of these data is given in ",
    "[ analysis ] where we demonstrate the inhomogeneity of the sample in the space of velocities , magnitudes , and positions .    [ discn],[result ]",
    "conclude our work , giving also a brief discussion of its implications .",
    "ngc 4697 is a normal , almost edge - on e4 - 5 galaxy located along the virgo southern extension . from the multi - colour ccd photometry of @xcite , the effective radius is @xmath13 , the mean ellipticity is 0.45 , and the pa is constant , consistent with a near - axisymmetric luminosity distribution .",
    "isophotal analysis shows that this galaxy has a positive @xmath14 coefficient suggesting a disk - like structure within @xmath15 @xcite .    from optical spectroscopy",
    ", its dominant stellar population has an age of @xmath16 gyr @xcite , consistent with the red mean b - v=0.91 colour .",
    "stellar absorption line kinematics along the major axis ( pa @xmath17 ) of ngc 4697 have been reported by @xcite and @xcite ; these velocity data can be well described by dynamical models based on the luminous mass distribution only .",
    "@xcite detected and measured radial velocities of 531 pns extending out to @xmath18 in this galaxy , with observational errors of @xmath19 . via dynamical analysis , they determined a constant mass to light ratio @xmath20 within @xmath21 , which is consistent with a @xmath22 gyr old stellar population with a salpeter mass function and slightly super solar metallicity .",
    "x - ray observations with rosat @xcite show only small amounts of hot gas in the halo of this galaxy .",
    "using more recent _ chandra _ data , @xcite could resolve most of the x - ray emission into nonuniformly distributed x - ray binary point sources ( xps ) , suggesting that ngc 4697 has lost most of its interstellar gas . though ngc 4697 does not show any signature of recent interactions , @xcite present evidence that the distribution of these x - ray sources is inconsistent with the optical morphology of ngc 4697 , and propose that these sources are mostly high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) associated with young stellar populations related to fallback of material in tidal tails onto a relaxed merger remnant , or to shock - induced star formation along tidal tails .",
    "they estimate typical fallback times of such tidal tails to be much longer than the settling timescale of the remnant and expect similar results for other elliptical galaxies with populations of @xmath23 gyr age .    for the work in this paper we use the pn sample presented by @xcite . after removing the possible contaminants and unclear detections ,",
    "they report unambigous detection of 535 pns .",
    "however only 526 out of 535 pns have confirmed measurements of velocity _ and _ magnitude , and we use these in our analysis . in order to determine the pnlf , it is crucial to estimate the magnitude where pn detection incompleteness sets in .",
    "detectability of a pn varies with the background galaxy surface brightness ; for a statistically complete sample the surface number density of pns should be directly proportional to it .",
    "@xcite show that their pn sample is statistically complete down to @xmath24 magnitudes outside an elliptical region of semi - major axis @xmath25 . in our analysis",
    ", we have thus defined two data sets : a _ complete sample _ ( with pns brighter than @xmath26 , outside the central ellipse of semi - major axis @xmath25 ) , and a _ total sample _ ( consisting of all pns with measured magnitude and radial velocity ) .",
    "the total number of pns in these data sets is 320 and 526 , respectively .",
    "the systemic velocity ( @xmath27 ) of ngc 4697 , obtained by averaging the observed velocity of all 526 pns is @xmath28 , which agrees with the values quoted in the literature ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the on - band filter configuration used to detect and",
    "measure velocities of these pns has a peak wavelength of @xmath29  , peak transmission of @xmath30 , equivalent width of @xmath31  , and fwhm of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the fwhm corresponds to a velocity range of @xmath33 around the systemic velocity of ngc 4697 .",
    "thus the filter transmission width is large enough to facilitate observations of pns with all velocities bound to ngc 4697 , irrespective of their magnitude . indeed , even at magnitudes as faint as @xmath34 in the total sample , pns with large velocities @xmath35 are detected .",
    "thus the velocity coverage in both samples ( total and complete ) is not biased with respect to the pn magnitudes .",
    "the pn magnitudes were measured by @xcite from their undispersed images ; they are accurate to 0.1 and 0.2 mag for @xmath12 brighter and fainter than 26.5 , with systematic effects below 2% . as a further test relevant for the present work",
    ", @xcite used the redundancy provided between their e and w fields : plotting magnitude differences between the two measurements ( e and w ) of pn candidates as a function of difference in distance from the center of the ccd , they found a scatter diagram without any evidence of correlation .",
    "@xcite estimated the errors in the pn velocities from calibration , image registration , spectrograph deformation and guiding errors to be @xmath36 .",
    "the velocities of 165 pns were measured independently in the e and w field of @xcite ; these velocities agree within a standard deviation of @xmath37 . in order to check whether a systematic difference between the velocities of bright and faint pns could be introduced by an asymmetric psf ( a possibility suggested by k.  freeman ) , we have superposed the psf s of three groups of 10 of the brightest pns , one selected at random , and two selected among those pns with the highest and lowest radial velocities . in the three cases we estimated the shift of the centroid of the entire psf with respect to the centroid of the upper part .",
    "the shifts were smaller than @xmath38 , and in some cases they were in the opposite sense compared to the results discussed below .",
    "in this section , we search for stellar population effects in the kinematics of the pns in ngc 4697 , by analysing the total and complete data sets with respect to their three observables : velocity , magnitude and position . for both data sets , we convert the observed pn radial velocities into co - rotating or counter - rotating velocities , as follows . with the galaxy center at the origin of the reference frame , and the x - axis oriented along the major axis ( pa@xmath39 deg ) ,",
    "the absorption line stellar - kinematic data predict positive line - of - sight mean velocity with respect to the galaxy systemic velocity , at slit positions towards the south - west of the center with x coordinate @xmath40 , and vice versa .",
    "we denote this sense of rotation as _ co - rotating _ , and the opposite sense as _ counter - rotating_. by definition , the major axis absorption line data is _ co - rotating_.      after subtracting the systemic velocity from the pn radial velocities , we define reduced velocities @xmath41 and denote the pns with @xmath42 @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) 0 as co - rotating ( counter - rotating ) . by definition ,",
    "the major axis absorption line data have @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath42 are displayed against the observed magnitudes in figure  [ mvplot ] .",
    "even at magnitudes as faint as @xmath34 in the total sample , pns with large velocities @xmath35 are detected , showing that there is no kinematic bias at faint magnitudes . henceforth , unless stated otherwise , we will always use the complete sample for our analysis .",
    "figure  [ mvplot ] shows that the complete pn sample appears to exhibit a correlation between magnitudes and kinematics , with faint pns showing more co - rotation than bright pns .",
    "we have performed several statistical tests to verify the significance and look for the origin of this correlation .",
    "table  [ tabpear ] shows the results of pearson s r - test for correlated data .",
    "velocities of counter - rotating pns are strongly linearly correlated with their brightness , while those of co - rotating pns are almost independent of their magnitude distribution .",
    "further , we divided our sample into 3 equal magnitude bins each of size @xmath46 , hereafter referred to as _",
    "faintest _ , _ intermediate _ , and _ brightest pns _ , and computed the mean reduced velocity and its dispersion in each of these bins along with the significance of their differences .",
    "as shown in table  [ tabvtftest ] , the _",
    "faint _ and _ bright pn subsamples _ defined through these bins have different mean reduced velocity and dispersions at @xmath47 and @xmath48 confidence , respectively . in figure",
    "[ 6bins ] we have plotted the cumulative velocity distribution of pns in the brightest and faintest magnitude bins .",
    "there is a visible excess of bright pns with counter rotating velocities .",
    "it is particularly evident from this figure that the brightest counter rotating pns display a velocity distribution that differs from the rest of the pns from the complete sample with high confidence .",
    "thus it is clear that the observed correlation between the pns kinematics and their magnitudes is compelling , and it arises because the faintest and brightest pns have significantly different velocity distributions .",
    "there appears to exist an additional component of bright , counter - rotating pns with respect to the overall sample .",

    "( 2 ) the velocity dispersion of the bright and unrelaxed pns in ngc 4697 is @xmath103 , but varying azimuthally , while that of the fainter main population is @xmath104 ( table [ tabvtftest ] , figs .  [ mvplot ] , [ zezang ] ) .",

    "the radial distribution of the bright population outside the incompleteness ellipse is concentrated towards the galaxy center and ks compatible ( 92% ) with the radial distribution of the fainter pns ( see fig .  [ radial ] ) .",
    "thus also the bright pns in ngc 4697 are bound to the galaxy .",
    "( 3 ) the surface density of pns with m@xmath99 is 0.58 pns / arcmin@xmath105 , while the mean surface density of virgo icpns is 0.02 pns / arcmin@xmath105 , much smaller @xcite .",
    "this last argument also rules out significant contamination by chance superpositions of pns even closer than ngc 4697 .",
    "we conclude that the bright pn population in ngc 4697 consists of genuine pns , and that it is dynamically bound to the ngc 4697 system .",
    "the irregular angular distribution and kinematics of these pns , by comparison with the fainter main population , show that they must belong to a separate stellar population not yet in dynamical equilibrium with ngc 4697 .",
    "pn samples as large as the one for ngc 4697 are still the exception .",
    "yet to undertake the analysis described in section  [ analysis ] it was crucial to work with a complete sample of some 300 pns .",
    "the pn.s project @xcite may lead to complete samples of similar size but as of now the typical sample sizes are @xmath106 @xcite and their magnitude distributions and completeness have not been studied .",
    "the only other elliptical galaxy with a comparable ( even larger ) sample is cen a @xcite . a detailed analysis of the distribution of cen a pns in the magnitude ",
    "velocity plane is still pending , but @xcite analysed the pnlf in cen a as a function of radius , based on narrow - band surveys .",
    "they concluded that no population effect on the pnlf bright cut - off could be seen , suggesting that the 0.3 mag difference between their main and outer halo samples was due to filter transmission uncertainties .",
    "analysis of the large sample from @xcite will clarify whether the pns in cen a are consistent with one or more subpopulations .",
    "this will be particularly interesting because cen a is believed to be the remnant of a galaxy merger , so one might expect pns from both the older stellar populations of the progenitors as well as from the stars formed in the subsequent interaction between them .    without large kinematic samples , searches for pn subpopulations",
    "must be based on the pn luminosity distributions .",
    "the work of jacoby , ciardullo and collaborators cited in the introduction has shown that the pnlf is remarkably uniform .",
    "however , there are exceptions : we recall that in the halo of m84 there exists a small population of overluminous pns whose cutoff is @xmath107 mag brighter than that of the main m84 population , but which appear nonetheless bound to the halo of m84 @xcite .",
    "they must therefore be intrinsically bright , due to some stellar population difference . in m87 ,",
    "the only overluminous pns projected onto the galaxy for which velocities have been measured @xcite , have very large relative velocities with respect to m87 .",
    "this is most naturally explained if these pns have fallen into the deep potential well of m87 from far out in the cluster ; this would again imply an intrinsic population difference .",
    "however , a larger kinematic sample in m87 is required to be certain .",
    "the existence of the bright pn subpopulation in ngc 4697 implies some uncertainty in the pnlf cut - off luminosity for this galaxy . depending on whether or not the azimuthally symmetric brightest pns are part of the main population , the cut - off luminosity of the main pn population in ngc 4697 is fainter than that of the whole population by @xmath108 mag ( figs .",
    "[ clumfun ] , [ rob ] ) .",
    "while this is consistent with the m84 result , is it also consistent with the systematic studies of pnlf distances ? @xcite have compared the pnlf and sbf distances , finding a distribution of residuals with a systematic offset by @xmath109 mag , which they suggested is due to internal extinction effects , and with a fwhm of @xmath110 mag .",
    "the offset has in the mean - time been reduced to @xmath111 mag , following a revision of the sbf distance scale by @xcite .",
    "the width of this distribution is consistent with their determination of the observational errors in both methods .",
    "however , the offset we have determined for ngc 4697 is also consistent with the distribution of residuals in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a large fraction of the bright pns in ngc 4697 belong to a secondary , dynamically young stellar population that is not well - mixed in the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "late infall of tidal structures @xcite or a merger with a smaller galaxy some time ago would be natural ways to add such an unmixed stellar component to ngc 4697 .",
    "what physical population difference is correlated with this dynamical youth ?",
    "@xcite show from their spectroscopic data for 13 bright pns that these have near - solar metallicities . of these 13 bright pns",
    ", 6 are inside the incompleteness ellipse , one has no measured velocity , and 6 belong to our secondary population .",
    "@xcite also use long - slit spectroscopy to show that the metallicity of the integrated stellar population within one effective radius has solar or higher metallicities .",
    "these observations make it unlikely that metallicity is the main factor responsible for the different magnitude distributions of the main and secondary pn populations in ngc 4697 .",
    "thus the more likely driver would appear to be an age difference , as suggested by @xcite and as might generally be expected in an accretion event . based on their result that the distribution of x - ray point sources in ngc 4697 does not follow",
    "the stellar light , @xcite have argued that this is because these sources were formed several @xmath112 years ago in tidal tails that are now falling back onto the galaxy .",
    "note , however , that the integrated light in ngc 4697 shows no evidence of young stars with mean age @xmath113 gyr @xcite , so this younger component could not be luminous enough to contaminate the integrated light to the level measured . also note that the observed increase of extinction in the pn envelope with pn core mass more than compensates for the increase of core luminosity with core mass , for bright pne in local group galaxies @xcite , so that stars with ages below @xmath114 gyr may not reach the [ oiii ] luminosity at the pnlf cutoff .",
    "a secondary stellar population younger than @xmath114 gyr is therefore unlikely as well .",
    "recently , @xcite have argued that the brightest pns in the pnlf must have core masses of @xmath115 , corresponding to main sequence masses of @xmath116 .",
    "they argue further that for such high - mass objects to occur in elliptical galaxies , these early - type galaxies would either have to contain a small , smoothly distributed component of young ( @xmath117 gyr age ) stars , or more likely , that the bright pns in these systems have evolved from blue straggler stars created through binary evolution . their blue straggler model , due to the assumption of a fixed distribution of primary - to - secondary mass ratios for the initial binaries , predicts that older stellar populations produce fewer bright pns per unit luminosity , as is observed , because the number of binary stars in a stellar population that can coalesce to @xmath116 blue stragglers decreases with time .",
    "if correct , this blue straggler model could also explain how the secondary population we found in ngc 4697 can contain a large fraction of the brightest pns in this galaxy , provided that the stellar population corresponding to this secondary pn population is appreciably younger than the main stellar population , whose age is @xmath16 gyr from optical spectroscopy @xcite . at the same time , this secondary stellar population must not be so young to violate either the constraints from the optical colours or from the envelope absorption - pn core mass correlation , i.e. , must be older than @xmath118 gyr .",
    "we can give an estimate for the effect of such an intermediate age population on the optical colours as follows .",
    "the secondary subpopulation traced by the bright and predominantly counterrotating pns may contain @xmath119 of all pns in the complete sample for ngc 4697 .",
    "a stellar population as blue as the bulge of m31 has a luminosity - specific pn density per unit @xmath120 up to 5 times higher than the populations characteristic for old elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus the subpopulation corresponding to the secondary pn population in ngc 4697 would be expected to contain @xmath121 of the blue luminosity of ngc 4697 , spread over a large fraction of at least the e image .",
    "to detect this we need deep and accurate photometry .",
    "the unmixed spatial and velocity distributions of the secondary pn population in ngc 4697 show that that this population is _ dynamically young _ , i.e ,",
    "has not had time to phase - mix and come to dynamical equilibrium in the gravitational potential of ngc 4697 .",
    "it may well be associated with tidal structures that were formed in a merger or accretion event @xmath122 gyr ago , and that have now fallen back onto the galaxy , or be associated with a more recent merger / accretion with a red galaxy such as described in @xcite . in a universe in which structures form hierarchically , such secondary stellar populations might be quite common in ellipitical galaxies , but they would be difficult to see .",
    "the present work shows that studying their pn populations is one promising approach of looking for such secondary populations .",
    "however , large pn samples are required ; most existing pn studies of early - type galaxies do not have the statistics for such an investigation .",
    "moreover , in only a fraction of cases may there be enough asymmetry signal to detect with a few hundred pns .",
    "we have analysed the magnitudes , kinematics and positions of a complete sample of 320 pns in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4697 from @xcite .",
    "this data set is large enough for drawing statistically significant conclusions , and it does not suffer from detection incompletenesses in either magnitudes or radial velocities . we know of no systematic effects in the data that could explain our results .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "bright and faint pns in ngc 4697 have significantly different radial velocity distributions .",
    "the mean velocities of the faint and bright subsamples ( co - rotating and @xmath80 , respectively ) and their velocity dispersions are different , with 94% and 99.3% confidence .",
    "thus the pns in ngc 4697 do not constitute a single population that is a fair tracer of the distribution of all stars .",
    "2 .   the luminosity functions of the extreme counter - rotating subsample ( @xmath84 ) and of the main population ( defined by @xmath123 ) are different with 99.7% confidence .",
    "the pnlf is therefore not universal .",
    "3 .   based on this",
    ", we suggest that there exist ( at least ) two pn populations in this galaxy .",
    "the secondary pn population in ngc 4697 is prominent in a sub - sample of counter - rotating pns brighter than @xmath0 .",
    "the luminosity function of the entire extreme counterrotating sample may be a first approximation to the luminosity function of the secondary population .",
    "the spatial distribution of bright pns with @xmath124 is different from that of the faint pns .",
    "the bright pns do not follow the azimuthal distribution of the optical light , show a left - right asymmetry , and have a positive mean radial velocity on both sides of the galaxy major axis , but zero velocity and larger dispersion on the minor axis .",
    "they are not in dynamical equilibrium in the potential of the galaxy .",
    "the fainter population has rotation properties more similar to the absorption line velocities , with azimuthally constant dispersion .",
    "5 .   using both their kinematics and angular distribution",
    ", we can estimate a lower limit to the statistical fraction of bright pns in the secondary population . based on this",
    "we estimate that the bright cutoff of the main population is uncertain by @xmath125 mag .",
    "our results have two main implications for the use of pns in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "first , for distance determinations with the pnlf , it may be important to understand how uniform the pn populations in the target galaxies are . from our analysis in ngc 4697",
    "we estimate that unrecognized subpopulations of pns in smaller samples than that in ngc 4697 may lead to variations of @xmath125 mag in the bright cutoff .",
    "this would correspond to distance errors of some @xmath126 , which , although a minor effect , could be significant in some cases .",
    "it will be necessary to verify how frequently such subpopulations occur in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we recall that also in the halo of m84 there exists a small population of overluminous pns whose cutoff is @xmath107 mag brighter than that of the main m84 population , but which appear nonetheless bound to the halo of m84 @xcite .",
    "the second implication concerns the use of pns as tracers for the angular momentum and gravitational potentials of elliptical galaxies .",
    "our analysis has shown that in ngc 4697 the bright pns do not trace the distribution and kinematics of stars and are not in dynamical equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "the fainter pns look more regularly distributed but may also contain a fraction of pns that belongs to this out - of - equilibrium population . clearly therefore , mass determinations based on pn kinematics will in future require careful study of the pn samples being used , not only to verify that these pns are in dynamical equilibrium , but also to test for different dynamical components .",
    "even if in equilibrium , a younger population of stars may be more flattened or have a steeper fall - off than the main body of the elliptical galaxy .",
    "if the pns from this population are indeed somewhat brighter than the main population , one can recognize such differences from their lower velocity dispersion or different radial density profile .",
    "however , deep observations and large pn samples will be required .",
