    "the horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphology in globular clusters ( gcs ) is mainly governed by metallicity ( e.g.  arp et al .  1952 ) , which therefore is considered as the _ first parameter _ regulating the hb stars position along the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the more metal - poor the gc , the more extended is the hb .",
    "the so called `` second - parameter problem '' recognises that the reality is more complex as some gcs with similar metallicity exhibit different hbs .",
    "hence , at least one second parameter is required to properly caracterize the hb morphology in gcs ( e.g.  sandage & wallerstein 1960 , van der berg 1965 ) .    while the second parameter has been widely studied since the sixties , its identity is still unclear .",
    "stellar mass , rotation , cluster central density , cluster mass , helium abundance , and age , among others , have been all suggested as possible solutions but none of them is fully satisfactory and possibly more than one parameter is at work ( see catelan 2009 , dotter et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that nearly all the _ normal _ gcs host stellar populations with different light - elements abundance ( carretta et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "observational studies have shown that in gcs co - exist stars belonging to a first generation , whose o and na composition is compatible with field stars at similar metallicities , and to second generation(s ) ,  those manifesting a chemical pattern ( o - depletion and na - enhancement ) compatible with a formation from material that underwent h - burning at high temperatures . since the same material depleted in o and enhanced in na",
    "is expected to be also he - enhanced , these findings provide new insight to the second - parameter problem , and seem to support the pioneering studies by norris & freeman ( 1982 ) suggesting that he abundances may take a role in the distribution of stars along the hb of gcs ( e.g.  dantona et al .",

    "could be regarded as the _ rosetta stone _ to connect multiple populations observed in the cmd with the hb morphology .",
    "this cluster indeed exhibits a strong dichotomy in the abundances of sodium and oxygen with the two main populations of na - poor / o - rich first - generation , and na - rich / o - poor second - generation stars defining two separate sequences along the red - giant branch ( rgb ) in the @xmath1 versus @xmath2 cmd . due to the large differences in the cn and ch bands affecting the ultraviolet region of the spectrum ,",
    "na - rich stars define a sequence on the red side of the rgb , while na - poor stars populate a bluer , more spread sequence ( marino et al .",
    "interestingly , m4 hosts a bimodal hb , which is well populated both on the red and the blue side of the rr - lyrae gap .",
    "it turns out that hb stars exhibit a bimodal na and o distribution similar to that found along the rgb , with red - hb stars having solar [ na / fe ] and blue - hb ones being o - depleted and na - enhanced ( marino et al .",

    "while the majority of gcs are almost homogeneous in iron , recent studies reveal that there exists a group of anomalous gcs ( agcs ) , characterised by internal variations in the bulk heavy - element content , including iron and elements associated to slow neutron - capture ( @xmath0-elements ) . the chemical analogies with the two _ anomalous _ cases @xmath4centauri and m54 , which are usually associated to the remnants of a dwarf galaxy cannibalised by the milky way , suggest the fascinating idea that agcs could be the survived nuclei of more massive systems .",
    "m22 is certainly the prototype of an agc .",
    "indeed it hosts two groups of stars with different content of iron and @xmath0-elements , and this bimodality is associated to a different c+n+o content ( marino et al .",

    "in this paper we analyse the chemical abundances for seven hb stars of m22 and investigate the possibility that stellar populations previously identified in this cluster could be related to a different position along the hb .",
    "our dataset consists of uves spectra collected within a project devoted to the study of sub - giant stars in m22 with giraffe , ( see marino et al .",
    "the fibers feeding the uves spectrograph were centered on seven hb stars distributed along the more luminous portion of the blue hb of m22 .",
    "the uves spectrograph was used in the red 580 setting providing spectra of r@xmath545000 .",
    "the spectra have a spectral coverage of @xmath52000    with the central wavelength at 5800   .",
    "all our target stars were observed in the same flames configuration in four different exposures of 46 minutes plus one exposure of 26 minutes , for a total observing time of 210 minutes .",
    "the single exposures were merged together , after they were reportad at the rest wavelength .",
    "the typical signal to noise ratio of the combined spectra is in the range 70@xmath6100 .",
    "data were reduced using uves pipelines ( ballester et al .",
    "2000 ) , including bias subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration and sky subtraction .",
    "we derived radial velocities ( rvs ) by cross - correlating the observed individual exposures with a spectrum simulated with atmospheric parameters close to our hb targets .",
    "the observed / template spectrum matches , after the heliocentric correction , yielded for our sample a mean rv of @xmath7  ( rms=6  ) .",
    "this value is in reasonable agreement with the values in the literature ( e.g. @xmath8  , rms=9  from marino et al .  2012 ; @xmath9  , rms=7.8  , from the value reported in the harris catalog ) .",
    "the rms/@xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the number of available exposures ) of our rvs measurements for each star is @xmath50.6 .",
    "this value has been taken as an estimate of the internal error associated with our rv values .",
    "the rvs derived from different exposures of the same star agree within our errors .",
    "hence , as our spectra were collected in a time interval of @xmath53 months , the presence of binaries with period up to @xmath5150 - 200 days can be excluded .",
    "the rvs of all the observed stars lie within @xmath123  @xmath13 of the average rv ( see tab .  [ data ] ) , that is the condition required for a star to be cluster member .",
    "however , in the case of m22 , the rv - based criteria used to assess the cluster membership may be weak .",
    "indeed m22 is projected toward the bulge , and the field is kinematically complex . since the probability of finding a _ very _ metal - poor field star with kinematics compatible with the cluster is extremely low ,",
    "the metallicities obtained for our stars ( listed in tab .  [ data ] , see sect .",
    "[ atm ] ) , all consistent with the m22 metallicities (  marino et al .",
    "2009 ) , constitute a more efficient tool to clean our sample from field contaminants .",
    "the status of he - burning star , as indicated by the derived atmospheric parameters ( see sect .  [ atm ] ) not compatible with a main sequence star ( except maybe for one target ) , can be used as an additional proof , because the probability of a field contaminant with such properties is even lower .",
    "so , we conclude that all our observed stars are cluster members .",
    "we provide an estimate of the projected rotational velocities ( ) for our stars by deconvolving the full width at half maximum of the cross - correlation profile for the widening of the synthetic template computed with the instrumental profile of our data .",

    "2002 ) have been used to fit the observed cmd .",
    "we assumed reddening e@xmath18=0.35 , [ fe / h]=@xmath191.85 , and distance modulus @xmath20=13.65 , in agreement with values in the literature ( harris 1996 , updated as in 2010 ) .",
    "spectroscopic measurements were conducted with the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) code moog ( sneden 1973 ) and by using model atmospheres interpolated from the grid of castelli et al .",
    "in general , except for the cooler stars , too few fe lines could be measured in our spectra to properly constrain all the atmospheric parameters .",
    "therefore , we derived gravities ( ) from the isochrone that best fit our cmd , and associated to each star the  value corresponding to the point on the isochrone with the smallest @xmath21 from the star .",

    "this takes into account the fact that , for a given isochrone , a star has a color that is better constrained than the magnitude , as any uncertainty in distance , gravity , or reddening , corresponds to a magnitude variation that is larger than that in color .",
    "once  had been fixed , effective temperatures ( ) and microturbolence values ( ) were derived from the spectra , by satisfying the ionisation equilibrium between fe  i and fe  ii abundances , and by removing trends in fe abundances with reduced equivalent width ( ew ) , respectively .",

    "a shift of our target stars in the position along the zahb by these photometric uncertainties corresponds to a variation in  of @xmath50.02 , that is so small to translate in negligible internal errors in the derived chemical abundances ( see sect .",

    "( i ) _ they have a different metallicity , with @xmath0-poor stars showing an overall metallicity @xmath50.15 dex lower than the @xmath0-rich stars , _ ( ii ) _ and neither the @xmath0-rich nor the @xmath0-poor group is consistent with a simple stellar population , as both groups exhibit significant variations in the abundance of light elements carbon , nitrogen , sodium , oxygen , and aluminium delineating individual c - n / na - o / na - al ( anti)correlations ( see marino et al .  2009 , 2012 )",
    ". unfortunately , the error on fe for hb stars is much larger than for rgb stars .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] derived from the hb sample perfectly corresponds to the @xmath0-rich average metallicity , but it still agrees within a 3  @xmath13 level with the mean value obtained for the @xmath0-poor giants .",
    "therefore , we are not able here to use the relatively small difference in metallicity as a tool to associate the analysed hb stars to one or the other rgb stellar group .",
    "this is also because the possible interplay of systematics , such as the different analysed lines , different treatment of nlte effects , can easily shift our mean metallicity .    as sodium varies much more than [ fe / h ] in the different m22 stellar populations , for our hb sample , [ na / fe ] abundances could provide some constraints on the belonging of these stars to the different stellar populations identified on the rgb . in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ naba ] , we plot [ na / fe ] against  for hb and rgb stars .",
    "both @xmath0-rich and @xmath0-poor rgb stars span a large range in [ na / fe ] with @xmath0-rich stars having , on average , higher sodium content .",
    "the histogram distribution of [ na / fe ] for @xmath0-poor stars is multimodal , with about one half of the stars clustered around [ na / fe]@xmath430.20 dex ( upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ naba ] ) .",
    "none of the rgb @xmath0-rich stars have [ na / fe]@xmath440 .",
    "the hb stars analysed in this paper span a much more narrow range in sodium .",
    "their mean sodium content is [ na / fe]=@xmath190.34@xmath120.03 ( rms=0.06 ) and they appear to belong to the same group of @xmath0-poor / na - poor stars identified along the rgb .",
    "the mean na abundance relative to fe for these rgb stars is [ na / fe]=@xmath45 ( rms=0.09 ) , which would decrease by @xmath50.06 if we account for nlte corrections on fe  i rgb abundances . despite",
    "the mean na abundances of the analysed hb stars agrees within 3@xmath13 with the average value measured on @xmath0-poor / na - poor rgb stars , we can not exclude systematic effects due to the different lines analysed . in any case , the low mean [ na / fe ] measured for the hb analysed stars provides a further and more robust indication that the these stars belong to the @xmath0-poor group .",
    "in addition to this , within the @xmath0-poor group , they constitute the progeny of the na - poor primordial population .",
    "within observational errors the chemical abundances of the other analysed elements mg , ca , ti , and cr do not show evidence for internal variations .",
    "the @xmath46 element abundances of mg , ca , and ti relative to iron are typical of population ii stars , as also observed on the rgb ( marino et al .",
    "2011 ) , while chromium abundances relative to iron are roughly solar - scaled .",
    "observational evidence of a connection between the distribution of stars along the hb and their light element chemical content have been shown in the _ normal _ gcs m 4 , 47  tuc , ngc  2808 and ngc  6397 ( marino et al .",

    "we have analysed spectra for seven stars in m22 spanning a small range of temperature ( 7300@xmath478300 ) along the hb , with the main purpose of measuring their ba and na abundances .",
    "our results support the idea that the distribution of stars along the hb is somehow related to the multiple stellar population phenomenon also for the _ anomalous _ gc m22 .",
    "recent studies on rgb and sgb stars have shown that m22 , differently from the most ( _ normal _ ) gcs , hosts two groups of stars with different content of iron , @xmath0-elements , and overall c+n+o ( marino et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 , 2012 ; da costa et al .",
    "2009 , alves brito et al .",
    "both the iron-/@xmath0-/cno - rich and iron-/@xmath0-/cno - poor group exhibits an internal scatter in the abundance of light elements ( e.g. c , n , o , na , al ) with the presence of na - o and c - n anticorrelations .",
    "fe- and @xmath0-poor stars have , on average , lower sodium and nitrogen abundance than fe- and @xmath0-rich ones . indeed , in this cluster , the chemical tracing of multiple stellar populations along the hb must take into account not only light elements , but also @xmath0-process elements .",
    "all our analysed hb stars are consistent with having all the same ba and na abundances , suggesting that they are consistent with being the progenie of the na - poor and @xmath0-poor first generation stars observed along the rgb .    similarly to what recently observed in _",
    "normal _ gcs , the reddest hb stars of m 22 belong to the primordial population , whose light - element chemical composition (  na ) is consistent with field stars at similar metallicity . as a consequence of this , it is tempting to speculate that he could be an important parameter in determining the hb morphology in gcs , as second generation(s ) stars are supposed to born from h - burning processed material .",
    "he - rich stars should evolve faster than he - poor ones and hence , present - day na - rich stars should be less massive than na - poor stars . as a consequence of their mass ,",
    "he / na - rich and he - na - poor stars should evolve into different hb regions , with na - rich hb stars having also redder colors .",
    "however , direct and strong observational proofs supporting this idea are still missing .    some indication for a possible he enhancement of second generation(s ) stars have been shown by dupree et al .",

    "( 2011 ) , on the basis of the detection of a chromospheric he line for na - rich rgb stars .",

    "2007 , milone et al .",
    "2012a ) suggest that present - day na - rich stars in gcs could be enhanced in he . on the other hand , the recent results of moni bidin et al .",
    "( 2011 ) cast many doubts , as they show that blue hb stars in @xmath4  centauri are not brighter than in other gcs , as would be expected as a consequence of a possible he enhancement .    in m 22",
    "a further complication comes from the presence of star - to - star variations in the overall c+n+o content .",
    "theoretical models , indeed , predict that the effective temperature of stars along the hb , as well as the mass loss along the rgb is affected by the cno abundance ( cassisi et al .  2008 , ventura et al .",
    "the fact that all the five targets for which barium content has been measured show abundances consistent with the @xmath0-poor group identified on the rgb ( marino et al .",
    "2009 ) , showing c+n+o abundances lower than in @xmath0-rich stars , supports the hypothesis that the cno abundance can play a role in determining the distribution of stars along the hb . in general",
