    "quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved space - time is the theory of quantum fields propagating on a classical background @xcite .",
    "this theory has provided a good approximate description of quantum phenomena in a regime where the quantum effects of gravity do not play a dominant role , but the effects of curved space - time may be significant . in particular ,",
    "this theory was applied to the description of quantum phenomena occurring in the early universe or close to the black holes",
    ". nevertheless , in the regimes arbitrarily close to the classical singularities where the space - time curvatures reach planckian scales , quantum effects of gravity can not be neglected , hence , the theory of quantum fields in classical curved space - time is no longer valid .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the quantum nature of the space - time would have to be taken into account while studying the qft in planck era .",
    "the theory of quantum gravity is one of the major open problems in physics , even though by now there are some interests in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite .",
    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) , is one possible approach to investigating quantum gravity effects in the early universe by using the quantization techniques from lqg , which provides a number of concrete results @xcite .",
    "in particular , lqc predicts that the quantum modification of space - time geometry at early times replaces the big bang singularity by a big bounce when the energy density of the universe approaches the planck energy @xcite . while the model shows the key role played by quantum effects in resolution of big bang singularity at early time , the question whether quantum gravity effects can also be manifested in large scale cosmology has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    according to several astrophysical observations",
    ", our universe is undergoing a state of accelerating expansion .",
    "such experiments indicate that the matter content of the universe , leading to the accelerating expansion , must contain dark energy component ( with equation of state @xmath0 where @xmath1 ) which constitutes @xmath2 of the total matter content of the universe @xcite .",
    "the recent astrophysical data as observed by the _ planck _",
    "( using baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe polarization low - multipole likelihood ( wp ) data ) , for a constant @xmath3 and a universe with the flat spatial section , indicates that @xmath4 at @xmath5 @xcite . from now on",
    ", we will thus suppose that dark energy is _ phantom _ , that is @xmath6 .",
    "when the universe is expanding , the density of dark matter decreases more quickly than the density of dark energy , and eventually the matter content of the universe becomes dark energy dominant at late times .",
    "therefore , dark energy might play an important role on the implications for the fate of the universe @xcite . in the context of dark energy cosmology ,",
    "there have been many classical investigations into the possibility that expanding universe can come to a violent end at a finite cosmic time , experiencing a singular fate .",
    "however , the effects of lqc correction might impose an upper bound for the density of dark energy at late time , that lead to resolving the future singularities and replacing them by a quantum bounce .",
    "interestingly , this indicates that the scale factor of the universe undergoes contracting and expanding phases periodically , so that the universe can possess an exactly cyclic evolution @xcite .",
    "one restriction in experiencing the quantum gravity is that the planck energy scale is very far beyond the reach of standard experiments such as particle accelerators .",
    "ultra - high energy phenomenas , possibly capable of probing the planck scale , have occurred at early universe .",
    "although we can not re - do the early universe , we can witness its consequences . while the theory of quantum fields propagating on classical flrw background is well - known , there has been some attempts to develop the theory of test quantum fields propagating on a quantum cosmological space - time where the background geometry is governed by the lqc model of the homogeneous and isotropic universe @xcite .",
    "these studies have also provided an extension of the quantum theory of cosmological perturbations to the planck era @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by a similar study of the qft on a bianchi i quantum space - time , it has been provided some phenomenological insight into the effects of the quantum nature of geometry on the propagation of test fields and the possible violation of the local lorentz symmetry @xcite .",
    "these effects might be possibly observed in some cosmological experiments .",
    "a general prediction of the qft in a curved background at early universe is that particles can be created by time - dependent gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a cyclic universe in lqc which initiated from a big bounce and then expanding towards a future bounce , may provide a background with no unique vacuum state .",
    "this implies a mechanism for quantum particle production , and further provides a circumstance in which one can measure and observe interesting qft phenomena at planck era in an expanding universe .",
    "this constitutes our main goal to investigate within this paper .    in this paper",
    "we study the quantum fields propagating on a cosmological background governed by the improved dynamics framework lqc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ lqc ]",
    "we consider a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe dominated by a dust matter in the past and a phantom dark energy component in the future ; then , by employing lqc modifications to the friedmann equation , we show that , the classical big bang and big rip singularities are resolved and are replaced by quantum bounces at planck era , one in early time and the other at late time .",
    "it will be further shown that such expanding and recollapsing phases lead to a cyclic behaviour for the universe . in section [ qft ]",
    "we study the qft in quantum cosmological background we presented in section [ lqc ] . we will then pay a particular attention on the mechanism of particle production in the universe at late time .",
    "finally , we will present the conclusions and the results of our work in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a flrw universe whose matter content constitutes a dust matter with the density @xmath7 , and a dark energy with the density @xmath8 ; its total energy density @xmath9 reads @xmath10 the total energy density @xmath9 must satisfy the conservation equation : @xmath11 furthermore , we assume that there is no interaction between dark matter and dark energy components , so that , each component must also satisfy the local conservation equation : @xmath12    in effective loop quantum cosmological scenario , evolution equations of the universe are given by the modified friedmann equation @xcite @xmath13 and the raychaudhuri equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the upper bound for the energy density of the universe provided by quantum gravity ( @xmath17 is the planck energy density ) @xcite .",
    "our goal in this section is to construct a cyclic cosmological scenario in lqc ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we consider an expanding phase for the universe initiated at a preferred instant of time , @xmath18 , being the initial quantum bounce resulted from loop - quantum - gravity effects at early time @xcite . then , in the far future when the density of the dark energy components becomes large and comparable with the planck energy , modifications to the friedmann equation given in lqc , again give rise to a quantum bounce for the fate of the universe . within this scenario ,",
    "we can select two cosmological phases which , as in qft , can play the role of ` in ' and ` out ' regions for the quantum ( scalar ) fields propagating on the quantum background ; they are , respectively , the ` initial ' and ` late time ' bounces .",

    "however , it must be stressed that , this does not lead to a trivial situation , since this approximation is different from the usual minkowski asymptotic approximation @xcite and from the sudden singularity approximation @xcite : in the present case , the transition from a matter dominated region to a dark energy dominated region , gave rise to the planck regimes ( in which quantum gravity effects are inevitable ) at two different asymptotic phases , which consequently , leaded to distinct ` in ' and ` out ' vacuum states .",
    "moreover , in the asymptotic limits ( i.e. , @xmath241 and @xmath176 ) , the first time derivative of the scale factor is zero , but the second time derivative is finite .",
    "these different contexts are reflected in the matching conditions ( via transition time @xmath238 ) connecting the initial and final states .",
    "nevertheless , it does not affects on the final particle production , since the particle number ( cf . see eq .",
    "( [ particle - number1 ] ) ) depends only on the characteristic of the initial and final vacuum .    for a scalar field ,",
    "undergoing cosmological evolution between the initial and final static phases , we solved the klein - gordon equation in the ( past ) matter dominated region ( @xmath242 ) , and the ( future ) dark energy dominated region ( @xmath243 ) ; the conformal time @xmath244 denotes the _ present _ , being the transition time ( i.e. , @xmath191 ) from matter dominated regime to dark energy dominated regime .",
    "we obtained mode functions of the fields close to the initial and final bounces whose forms are similar to that of a flat space mode function .",
    "for the herein _ massive _ scalar field , different cosmic scales of the initial and final phases leaded to different frequencies for the modes of the quantum fields , and consequently , provided non - unique vacuum states in the ` in ' and ` out ' regions ; this non - uniqueness of the vacuum was accompanied by particle production phenomena in the ` out ' region . for a _ massless _ scalar field",
    ", however , mode functions of the ` in ' and ` out ' regions are the same as @xmath245 , possessing a unique vacuum of the minkowski space ; hence , there is no final effects for the particle production at late time , for massless fields .",
    "the energy density of quantum scalar field , @xmath246 , in the herein model , was assumed to be negligible initially in comparison to the quantum background density ( which is of the order @xmath247 ) near the initial bounce .",
    "moreover , there were no particles production initially since @xmath248 .",
    "our concern , thus , was to investigate the back - reaction of quantum effects carried by the total particles created in the ` out ' region .",
    "we thus computed the total density of the quantum particles , @xmath249 , created at late time , on approach to the future bounce where the energy density , curvature and the scale factor of the background geometry reaches their upper bounds .",
    "our analysis showed that the density of created particles in the ` out ' region remains negligible in comparison to the quantum background density ( i.e , @xmath250 ) .",
    "this indicates that the back - reaction effects of the quantum particle production do not influence the evolution of the universe until late time .",
    "in addition , the future bounce , induced by quantum gravity effects , was unscathed by the back - reaction from the quantum field .",
    "one important issue for the model analysed here is the possibility of observational traces of the quantum phase and of the oscillatory behaviour of the universe .",
    "this would require , for example , to compute the evolution of perturbations in the model .",
    "however , we must face an important limitation : we have no classical covariant formulation of the equations of motion governing the evolution of the universe .",
    "strictly speaking , this analysis would require to return to the full quantum model in performing the perturbative analysis , what implies in considerable technical difficulties ( c.f .",
    "this drawback is less severe in the case of gravitational waves ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , since there is no coupling of the spin 2 modes with the scalar and vectorial modes ( which are directly connected to the matter content ) , at least at linear level .",
    "if the gravitational waves , represented by the propagation of the traceless , transverse field @xmath251 , obeys the same equation as in the usual general relativity case , that is , @xmath252 where @xmath253 , with @xmath254 being the polarisation tensor and @xmath255 the scale factor , we would have the same equation as for a massless scalar field propagating in the geometry determined by the background equations @xcite .",
    "we would have in this case , qualitatively , the same behaviour as displayed in figure [ fig - field ] for the massive field , but with an accumulative divergence for transplackian values of @xmath183 .",
    "however , it is not sure that equation ( [ gw ] ) remains the same in the present case . moreover , the transplanckian regime would require a full quantum analysis , including for the background . due to these important difficulties to surmount , we postpone a perturbative analysis for future researches .    in general",
    ", a cyclic universe seems to be in conflict with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "more precisely , the entropy of the universe increases , through natural thermodynamic processes , in every cycle of expansion and contraction @xcite .",
    "so that , at the beginning of a new cycle , there is higher entropy density ( than the previous cycle ) because of the entropy added from earlier cycles .",
    "it turns out that the duration of a cycle is sensitive to the entropy density , thus by increasing the entropy , the duration of the cycle increases as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the cycles become shorter and shorter the further back we go until , after a finite time , they shrink to zero duration .",
    "new hope for a consistent cyclic cosmology , to get rid of this puzzling situation , was provided by introducing a cyclic model based on ( phantom ) dark energy @xcite , and also in an ekpyrotic scenario derived from the brane - world cosmological model @xcite : in both scenarios , there are accelerating phases leading to a suppression of entropy . in the context of lqc , there are several proposals in order to deal with the issue of entropy problem in bouncing universe @xcite .",
    "in addition , presence of the quantum fields in such bouncing scenario may also give rise to the significant effects on entropy generation from particle creation ; there are inquiries on finding a viable measure of entropy for particle production processes in literature ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present model ,",
    "the oscillatory behaviour indicated in the quantum modes ( see figure [ fig - field ] ) may be a hint that there is no major problem with the cumulative effects as the cycle goes on .",
    "this oscillatory behaviour breaks down as the planck regime is approached .",
    "but , the approximation made in the present work may not be valid in the deep planck regime .",
    "the necessary renormalization procedure changes also the high frequency behaviour . nevertheless , more investigation is needed in order to understand the effects of particle creation on generation of the entropy near the quantum bounce in the full quantum theory .",
