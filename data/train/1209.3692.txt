    "alkali halides are inorganic compounds composed of an alkali metal and a halogen .",
    "the most abundant by far in nature is sodium chloride ( nacl ) .",
    "nacl in its solid form has a cubic structure ( usually denoted as nacl structure ) and melts at a relatively high temperature ( around 1070  k at ambient pressure ) as a consequence of its high lattice energy .",
    "nacl dissolves in polar solvents , such as water , to give ionic solutions that contain highly solvated anions and cations , relevant for the functioning of biological organisms .    in the last century , there have been many thorough studies aimed at quantitatively describing the physical properties of alkali halides . to a first approximation alkali halides are two - component mixtures of atomic anions and cations which interact through a spherically symmetrical potential .",
    "the two unusual features of ionic crystals are the slow decay of the interaction potential , which causes long - range structural correlations , and the strength of the attractive cation - anion interactions .",
    "the simplest model for a molten salt is the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , in which ions are modelled by hard spheres with positive and negative unit charges .",
    "the rpm has been studied by a number of groups@xcite .",
    "back in 1919 , born developed a numerical model to estimate the energy of an ionic crystal  @xcite .",
    "pauling , based on born s primitive model , studied the effect of the ions sizes on ionic salts  @xcite and mayer evaluated the role of polarizability and dispersive forces on alkali halides  @xcite and proposed , together with huggins , a generalization of born s repulsive energy  @xcite .",
    "more recently , several ion - ion interaction potentials have been developed in order to numerically simulate alkali halides . in 1962",
    "tosi and fumi , fitting the huggins - mayer dispersive energy to crystallographic data , proposed an empirical potential parameterizing the repulsive part of the nacl alkali halide interactions  @xcite and including the dipole - quadrupole van der waals term , that imitated the polarization distortion of the electronic cloud .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of the tosi - fumi ( tf ) potential have been later underlined by lewis and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "the model in general predicts good densities and lattice energies of alkaline halides .",
    "however it is unable to reproduce dynamical features of ionic crystals such as the phonon dispersion curves .",
    "also the model predicts incorrectly the similarity of like pair distribution functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 which is absent in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the tf model was used for the first time in a numerical simulation by adams and mcdonald  @xcite , who obtained a remarkably good agreement between numerical and experimental results . in recent years",
    ", the tosi - fumi potential has also been used to study liquid / solid phase transitions in alkali halides : valeriani _ et al .",
    "_ studied homogeneous crystal nucleation in molten nacl  @xcite and chen and zhu carried out homogeneous nucleation studies of other alkali halides , such as kbr  @xcite and nabr  @xcite .",
    "zykova - timan _ et al .",
    "_ studied packing issues related to the interfacial free - energy between the liquid and solid phases  @xcite .",
    "in all these works knowledge of the melting temperature @xmath3 was needed .",
    "in fact , the melting point of nacl has been estimated for the tf model by several groups . in 2003 , anwar _",
    "et al . _ determined by free - energy calculations the melting temperature of nacl for the tosi - fumi model  @xcite .",
    "later on similar results were obtained by eike _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and mastny _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and by zykova - timan _ et al .",
    "molecular simulations have also been performed to analyze experimental results  @xcite . in some works",
    "the melting temperature was calculated by direct heating of the solid , hence the thermal instability limit rather that the melting temperature was calculated  @xcite . more recently in order to compute t@xmath0 belonoshko _",
    "_ performed two - phase simulations of nacl and lif  @xcite .",
    "besides tf , another popular model used to describe nacl was proposed more recently by smith and dang ( sd )  @xcite who presented an interaction potential where the ion - ion interactions were lennard - jones like .",
    "this model potential has become quite popular when studying nacl in water solutions , even though the properties of its solid phase are still unknown . similar to the sd potential , joung - cheatham ( jc ) presented another interaction potential for nacl where the ion - ion interactions were lennard - jones like and proposed several nacl force - fields tailored to be used in a water solution  @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly the melting point of the sd and jc / nacl potentials are still unknown",
    ".    good model potentials for alkali halides are also useful to study ionic solutions .",
    "simulations of alkali halides dissolved in water have proved useful to study thermodynamic mixing properties , such as the cryoscopic descent of the melting temperature @xcite .",
    "the properties of alkali halides solutions have been studied at low temperatures in order to localize the hypothesised second critical point of water @xcite .",
    "the solubility of nacl in water has also received certain interest @xcite .",
    "however we should underline that in order to determine the solubility of a salt , the chemical potential of the solid should be known .",
    "thus , it is relevant to quantitatively compare several interaction potentials in order to estimate their efficiency in mimicking the properties of nacl - type alkali halides .",
    "to this aim , in this manuscript we evaluate the liquid - solid equilibrium of such systems .",
    "we have computed the melting temperature ( at normal pressure ) for three alkali halides , emphasizing nacl , for three interaction models : the born - mayer - huggins - tosi - fumi ( tf )  @xcite , the smith - dang ( sd )  @xcite and the joung - cheatham ( jc ) potential  @xcite .",
    "the three potentials are two - body and non - polarizable model potentials , characterized by a repulsive term , a short - range attraction and a long - range coulombic interaction term . to calculate the melting temperature ( t@xmath0 ) we used three independent routes : 1 ) liquid / solid direct coexistence 2 ) free - energy calculations and 3 ) hamiltonian gibbs - duhem integration .",
    "we have found that the value obtained for the t@xmath0 of the tf / nacl is in good agreement with the experiment , in contrast with the results obtained for the sd / nacl and jc / nacl models .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the tf / nacl model is the most suitable for studies of pure nacl . using hamiltonian gibbs - duhem integration",
    "we have also evaluated t@xmath0 for other tf / alkali halides and concluded that the quality of the results obtained with the tf potential depends on the alkali halide chosen .",
    "the tf model provides good predictions for alkali halides that involve k@xmath4 , cl@xmath5 , na@xmath4 , br@xmath5 and li@xmath4 ions , whereas it performs much worse for alkali halides involving rb@xmath4 or f@xmath5 ions .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : we first introduce the interaction potentials of the alkali halides under study , i.e. born - mayer - huggins - tosi - fumi potential ( tf ) , the smith - dang potential ( sd ) and the joung - cheatham ( jc ) potential .",
    "then we describe the three simulation routes followed to compute their melting temperature : 1 ) the liquid / solid direct coexistence 2 ) the einstein crystal / molecule for the solid and the thermodynamic integration for the liquid and 3 ) the hamiltonian gibbs - duhem integration . to conclude we will present our results obtained for different alkali halides .",
    "the interaction potentials we used are two - body and non - polarizable model potentials , each of them characterized by a repulsive term , a short - range attractive and a long - range coulomb interaction term .",
    "the tf model potential has the following form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance between two ions with charge @xmath8 , the first term is the born - mayer repulsive term , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the van der waals attractive interaction terms and the last term corresponds to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the tf / alkali halides are given as supplementary material@xcite .",
    "both the sd and the jc model potentials can be written using the following expression : @xmath15 + \\frac{q_i q_j}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o r_{ij } } \\label{sdjc}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the distance between two ions with charge @xmath8 .",
    "the first term is lennard - jones - like , and its parameters are given in the supplementary information file@xcite .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "[ sdjc ] corresponds to the coulomb interaction . for the jc potential",
    ", we are going to use the parameters introduced to simulate nacl in spc / e water  @xcite .",
    "for the sd and jc the crossed interaction parameters are obtained using the lorentz - berthelot combining rules @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the tf model was developed to study ionic crystals and pure alkali halides in the solid phase whereas the sd was obtained to model na@xmath4 and cl@xmath5 in water .",
    "the jc was fitted to model nacl both in the solid phase and in aqueous solutions . in",
    "what follows , we shall refer to ions as particles .    when computing t@xmath0 for the tf / nacl interaction potential , we follow three independent routes : 1 ) liquid / solid direct coexistence , 2 ) free - energy calculations and 3)hamiltonian gibbs - duhem integration . for the sd / nacl and jc / nacl and for other",
    "tf / alkali halides we use the first and the third route .      the first route we follow to compute the melting temperature is by means of the liquid / solid direct coexistence , originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . to start with",
    ", we generate an equilibrated configuration of the nacl solid phase in contact with its liquid .",
    "after having prepared the liquid - solid configuration , we run several npt simulations ( with anisotropic scaling , so that each side of the simulation box changes independtly ) at different temperatures and always at a pressure of 1 bar .",
    "direct coexistence simulations should be performed in the np@xmath16 t ensemble , where z is the axis perpendicular to the fluid - solid interface and @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been chosen carefully to avoid the presence of stress . however , we have recently shown that npt simulations ( with anisotropic scaling ) provide proper results for sufficiently large systems @xcite .",
    "depending on the temperature , the system evolves towards complete freezing or melting of the sample .",
    "since we do not know the location of the melting temperature , we simulate the system in a wide range of temperatures and identify the melting temperature @xmath19 as the average of the highest temperature at which the liquid freezes and the lowest temperature at which the solid melts .",
    "a more elaborate procedure would require to estimate the slope of the growth rate of the solid - fluid interface ( which is positive at temperatures below the melting point and negative at temperatures above the melting point ) and to locate the temperature at which the growth rate of interface is zero ( i.e the melting point ) . since the growth of the solid is a stochastic process the determination of the growth rate requires to accumulate statistics over many different trajectories making the calculations quite expensive@xcite .",
    "the procedure used here is simpler and has provided reliable results for other systems as hard spheres@xcite or water@xcite although admittedly it yields a somewhat larger error in the estimate of the melting point temperature obtained from direct coexistence simulations ( of about 5k ) .      in this route , we first compute the helmholtz free - energy of both the solid and the liquid phase ; next , we estimate the gibbs free - energy ( @xmath20 ) by simply adding @xmath21 . to compute the melting temperature we perform thermodynamic integration as a function of temperature at constant pressure to evaluate where the chemical potentials ( @xmath22 ) of both phases coincides . to estimate the free - energy of the bulk solid phase we use the einstein crystal  @xcite and the einstein molecule methods  @xcite",
    "both methods are based on the calculation of the free - energy difference between the target solid and a reference system at the solid equilibrium - density for the given thermodynamic conditions ( obtained with an npt simulation ) .",
    "the reference system of the einstein crystal method consists of an ideal solid whose free - energy can be analytically computed ( an `` einstein crystal '' with the center of mass fixed , where the inter - molecular interactions are neglected and particles are bound to their lattice equilibrium positions by a harmonic potential with strength @xmath23 ) .",
    "the einstein molecule method differs from the previous one due to the fact that we now fix only the position of one particle instead of the center of mass .",
    "thermodynamic integration is performed in two steps  @xcite : 1 ) we evaluate the free - energy difference ( @xmath24 a@xmath25 ) between the ideal einstein crystal and the einstein crystal in which particles interact through the hamiltonian of the original solid ( `` interacting '' einstein crystal ) .",
    "2 ) next we calculate the free - energy difference ( @xmath24 a@xmath26 ) between the interacting einstein crystal and the original solid , by means of thermodynamic integration : @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 represents the energy of the interacting einstein crystal , @xmath29 the one of the original solid , and @xmath30 is the coupling parameter that allows us to integrate from the interacting einstein crystal ( @xmath31 ) to the desired solid ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the final expression of the helmholtz free - energy @xmath33 coming from the einstein crystal / molecule calculations is @xcite : @xmath34 where a@xmath35 is the free energy of the reference system , whose analytical expression is slightly different in the einstein crystal and einstein molecule ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . @xmath24a@xmath25 and @xmath24a@xmath26 are computed in the same way in the einstein crystal and einstein molecule methods ( the only difference being the choice of the point that remains fixed in the simulations , whether the system s center of mass or a reference particle s center of mass ) .",
    "it has been shown that , since the free energy of a solid is uniquely defined , its value does not depend on the method used to compute it and the two methodologies give exactly the same results  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to set the thermal de broglie wave length of all species to 1   , and the internal partition functions of all species to one .",
    "these arbitrary choices affect the value of the free energy but does not affect phase equilibria ( provided the same choice is adopted in all phases ) .    to estimate the free - energy of the bulk liquid we use hamiltonian thermodynamic integration as in ref .",
    "@xcite , calculating the free - energy difference between the liquid alkali halide and a reference lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid for which the free - energy is known . starting from an equilibrated nacl liquid , we perturb the hamiltonian of the system so that each ion is gradually transformed into a lj atom . the path connecting both states is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37/@xmath38 are the total energies of the lennard jones and nacl fluids , respectively , and @xmath30 is the coupling parameter ( @xmath31 corresponds to nacl whereas @xmath30=1 to a lj fluid ) .",
    "the helmholtz free - energy of a nacl ( a@xmath39 ) is computed as : @xmath40 given that the lennard - jones free - energy ( a@xmath41 ) is already known @xcite and the integral in the eq .",
    "[ freeliq ] ( @xmath42 ) can be numerically evaluated , we can determine the free - energy a@xmath39 of the liquid alkali halide . in order to estimate the integral in eq .",
    "[ freeliq ] , we choose 20 values of @xmath30 between 0 and 1 , 10 of them equally spaced from 0.000 to 0.95 and the remaining 10 from 0.95 to 1.000 , and integrate each region using the simpson integration method .",
    "this choice originated from then fact that when @xmath30 has a value close to 1.0 , the integrand changes abruptly , dropping to the dispersive energy of a lj .",
    "the lennard - jones free - energy consists of two terms : @xmath43 , where a@xmath44 is the excess and a@xmath45 the ideal part .",
    "a@xmath46 for a lennard - jones fluid has been already computed for a broad range of temperatures and densities in ref .",
    "the free energy of the ideal gas of a mixture of n@xmath47 and n@xmath48 is given by @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where n = n@xmath47 + n@xmath48 is the total number of particles in the system with density @xmath50 ( and @xmath51 = @xmath52 = @xmath53/2 ) and @xmath54 is the de broglie thermal length ( @xmath55@xmath56 = h / @xmath57 ) , that we arbitrarily set to 1   , to be consistent with our choice for the solid phase .",
    "the third route we follow to compute the melting temperature is by means of hamiltonian gibbs - duhem thermodynamic integration as in ref .",
    "starting from the liquid - solid coexistence point of a reference system ( @xmath58 ) , the hamiltonian gibbs - duhem thermodynamic integration allows one to compute the coexistence point of the system of interest ( whose hamiltonian is @xmath59 ) by resolving a clapeyron - like differential equation . in more detail",

    "when using the liquid / solid direct coexistence route to compute the melting temperature we choose systems containing either 1024 [ 512 solid/512 liquid ] , 2000 [ 1000solid/1000liquid ] or 4000 ions [ 2000 solid/2000 liquid ] . when using the free - energy calculations route to compute the melting temperature , we simulate systems of 1000 ions ( the unit cell of nacl contains 8 particles ) . for the hamiltonian gibbs - duhem integration route",
    "we simulate systems of 1000 ions .",

    "we define a mc cycle as a translational trial - move per particle and a trial - volume change . for the thermodynamic integration in the nvt ensemble we carried out 2x10@xmath81 equilibration and 8x10@xmath81 production cycles for every value of @xmath30 and simulated 20 values of @xmath30 per thermodynamic state .",

    "more elaborate models developed recently employ potentials which include the polarization effects using either multipole expansions @xcite or the distortable ion model @xcite .",
    "the tf / alkali halide potentials have a serious transferability problem : the same ions present different potential parameters depending on the alkali halide ( i.e. the na - na interaction is different in nacl and naf ) . in the case of lj - like models",
    ", it seems that it is not possible to describe nacl accurately with a model consisting of point charges and a lennard - jones interaction site for each ion where lorentz - berthelot rules are used to describe the interaction between cations and anions .",
    "the same conclusion was obtained by cavallari _",
    "@xcite who showed how the ion - ion interaction reconstructed from standard lb rules fail to correctly account for the structure of the concentrated solutions model with _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "an interesting possibility would be incorporating deviations to the lorentz - berthelot combining rules to obtain the crossed interactions between the ions or adjusting these interactions as in the tf model , although probably the use of a van der waals r@xmath95 term would not capture the underlying physics .",
