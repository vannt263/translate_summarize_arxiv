    "the macho collaboration has interpreted its observations of microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) as evidence that about one third of the halo of our own halo exists in the form of objects of around @xmath1 solar mass  ( @xcite ) . unfortunately , there are seemingly insuperable objections to all the obvious candidates for the lensing population .",
    "normal stars would be visible  ( @xcite ) , white dwarfs are ruled out by current population ii abundance ratios  ( @xcite ) , while the hubble deep field gives stringent restrictions on the contribution of red dwarfs  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the microlensing events would be easier to understand if the characteristic mass of the lensing objects was below the hydrogen - burning limit ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "of course , a lensing population of brown dwarfs would be much too dark to be visible and there is no conflict either with the metallicity data or the hubble deep field star counts .",
    "so , it is natural to ask the questions : can the deflectors be brown dwarfs ?",
    "is it possible that the masses of the microlenses have hitherto been overestimated ?",
    "the aim of this letter is to answer these questions .",
    "uncertainties in estimates of the lens candidates arise from two fundamental sources : low number statistics and modelling error .",
    "although the number of microlensing events observed towards the lmc is still low , a determination of the average mass for a _ given _ halo model can be obtained with perhaps 50% accuracy ( see eg .",
    "mao & paczyski 1996 ; alcock et al .",
    "this number is expected to improve substantially over the course of the next few years as new events are detected .",
    "a much more important source of error comes from our ignorance of the structure of the outer milky way halo .",
    "the halo models used by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are either isotropic , such as the cored isothermal sphere  ( @xcite ) , or they are very nearly so , such as the power - law models  ( @xcite ) .",
    "alcock et al . (",
    "1997 ; see especially figures 17 and 24 ) plot likelihood contours in the plane of the lens mass and baryon fraction of the halo .",
    "the striking elongation of the contours along the baryon fraction axis suggests that there is comparatively little uncertainty in the mass estimates of the microlenses for a given model .",
    "one worry is that this propitious state of affairs is a consequence of using halo models that all pretty much look the same ! in a percipient investigation , markovi & sommer - larsen ( 1997 ) looked at a wider range of halos , including some with anisotropic velocity distributions .",
    "they found that @xmath3 events ( an order of magnitude more than presently available ) are needed to estimate the average mass .",
    "this large error bar includes both the modelling and the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the claims of markovi & sommer - larsen ( 1997 ) may be somewhat overstated because of the uniform priors used in their monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , mao & paczyski ( 1996 ) have also emphasised the difficulty of drawing firm conclusions about the mass distribution of the lenses from the limited sample available .",
    "these two papers consider both the statistical and the modelling uncertainties together .",
    "the focus of our paper is on the modelling uncertainty alone .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate unambiguously that the modelling uncertainties can not be responsible for the high average mass estimates of alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "low mass lenses such as brown dwarfs are already ruled only for halo models with negligible rotation and isotropic velocity dispersions ( e.g. , chabrier , segretailn & mra 1996 ) . to rule out",
    "the hypothesis that the lenses are brown dwarfs requires a thorough investigation of halo models with very different kinematics  in particular with different streaming velocities and different random motions .",
    "gyuk & gates ( 1998 ) have already shown that rotating halos are unable to reduce the microlensing mass estimates below about @xmath4 ( unless all the lensing takes place very close to the sun ) .",
    "this letter will examine the effects of anisotropy and show that the associated _ modeling uncertainties _ can not cause the high lens mass estimates .",
    "let us start with a thought experiment .",
    "suppose a stationary observer views a stationary source through a population of lenses with density @xmath5 .",
    "the timescale of any lensing event is related to the einstein radius @xmath6 and the transverse velocity @xmath7 by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the lens and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances to deflector and source .",
    "suppose now that the distribution of transverse velocities of the lenses is gaussian with a dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "the microlensing optical depth @xmath13 is well - known to be independent of the masses of the lenses  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rate of microlensing @xmath14 is ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath15 and the timescale histogram is @xmath16,\\ ] ] with @xmath17 .",
    "this demonstrates explicitly that all the microlensing quantities ( @xmath18 ) depend only on the ratio @xmath19 .",
    "given the microlensing data - set alone , it is not possible to constrain the mass of the deflectors at all !",
    "any mass estimate is solely a consequence of assumptions regarding the transverse velocity dispersions .",
    "the same data will be consistent with smaller inferred mass if the transverse motions are reduced .",
    "this degeneracy between mass and velocity can be partially lifted if parallax effects  ( @xcite ) , or finite source size effects  ( @xcite ) can be detected in the lightcurve .    of course , the analysis of the microlensing events towards the lmc is more complex than this thought experiment .",
    "both the sun and the lmc are moving and therefore the expectation value of the transverse velocity of the lens with respect to the microlensing tube can not be made arbitrarily small just by changing the velocity anisotropy of the lenses .",
    "figure 1 shows a planform of the sun and the lmc projected on the galactic equatorial plane .",
    "the line of sight from the sun to the lmc is shown as a dashed line . in the outer parts of the halo , this line of sight",
    "is aligned very nearly with the radial direction of the spherical polar coordinate systems .",
    "radial anisotropy of the velocity dispersion tensor is the best option for reducing the mass estimates .",
    "nearer the solar circle , the offset of the sun from the galactic center becomes important .",
    "the line of sight is aligned more nearly with the azimuthal direction .",
    "this means that radial anisotropy is now dangerous .",
    "the best recipe for the minimum microlensing mass is to allow the velocity dispersion tensor to be azimuthally distended near the sun and to become radially distended in the outer halo .    as a simple model ,",
    "let us assume that the density of the lensing population is smooth and falls off like a power of the distance ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we take the overall potential to be a power - law model , so that the circular velocity , @xmath21 , falls like @xmath22 .",
    "rich families of solutions to the jeans equations for power - law density distributions in power - law potentials are known  ( @xcite ) .",
    "these are all aligned in the spherical polar coordinates , but vary in the anisotropy of the principal components of the velocity dispersion tensor @xmath23 .",
    "the detailed jeans solutions all satisfy the constraint ( see eq . ( 3.8 ) of @xcite ) @xmath24 from the standpoint of minimising the microlensing mass estimates , the best of all possible worlds is to replace the inequality in the above expression with an equality .",
    "this means that the total kinetic energy required to support the lensing population against gravity is underestimated .",
    "the inferred microlensing mass will always be lower than the true mass .",
    "we allow the ratio of the principal components of the velocity dispersions to vary subject only to the condition that the sum of the components does not violate the inequality ( 4 ) .",
    "thus , the jeans equations are not satisfied spot - wise , but only in a gross sense .",
    "the total kinetic energy can not be reduced further without violating the rules of gravitational physics .",
    "if all the deflectors are @xmath25 objects , the rate is ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the average value of the transverse velocity of the lens with respect to the microlensing tube .",
    "the best estimator of the average event duration @xmath28 is 61 days ( see appendix a of  @xcite ) .",
    "this uses the events and the efficiencies given in alcock et al . (",
    "so the microlensing mass estimate @xmath29 is @xmath30 ^ 2.\\ ] ] our algorithm for finding the minimum microlensing mass estimate is as follows .",
    "choose the model parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 and an alignment of the velocity dispersion tensor , and then apportion the total kinetic energy into the three principal components subject only to the constraint ( 4 ) .",
    "the velocity anisotropy may be parametrised by @xmath33 let us insist that the velocity ellipsoid can not be anisotropic by more than a @xmath34 ratio ; that is to say , @xmath35 and @xmath36 must lie within the range @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "for comparison , freeman ( 1987 ) reports that the population ii stars in the spheroid have velocity dispersions at the solar position oriented on the cylindrical polar coordinate system such that @xmath39 .",
    "the microlensing mass is to be minimised as both the anisotropy parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the alignment of the velocity ellipsoid are varied .    after a little thought , it is obvious what the alignment is for the minimum mass estimate ",
    "the best of all possible worlds is when the velocity ellipsoid is aligned along the microlensing tube itself , with as much kinetic energy as possible put into motions along the tube and as little as possible put into transverse motions .",
    "figure 2 shows the inferred mass as a function of @xmath32 where the mass has been minimized by allowing @xmath35 and @xmath36 to float over their respective ranges .",
    "different curves correspond to the range @xmath40 .",
    "in such a situation , @xmath35 always prefers to be as low as possible , while @xmath36 is only weakly constrained .",
    "the minimum mass estimate ranges from @xmath41 when @xmath42 to @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",
    "the inferred mass is always larger than the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "this leads us to the main result of the letter . _",
    "if the density of the microlensing population is smooth and monotonic decreasing ( that is , reasonably well - approximated by a power - law ) , then the microlenses can not be brown dwarfs , irrespective of the details of their kinematics_. the strength of this statement is that it is based on the jeans equations and therefore robust .",
    "let us emphasise that this algorithm for obtaining the minimum mass gives a value that is _ very much a lower limit_. it uses a number of gratuitous approximations , all of which act to reduce the mass estimate .",
    "for example , the jeans solutions of reasonable tracer populations may possess a kinetic energy greater than the minimum prescribed by eq .",
    "( 4 ) . again ,",
    "almost certainly , the alignment along the microlensing tube that yields the minimum mass can not be built  that is , there is no set of stellar orbits that can be superposed to yield a true dynamical model corresponding to the jeans solution . making the model more realistic will necessarily require more massive lenses .",
    "in this section we provide an estimate of the more modest reduction in the microlensing masses expected from velocity anisotropy for one particular reasonably realistic model of the halo .    to do this , let us build jeans solutions of tracer populations with the density of the jaffe ( 1983 ) sphere @xmath45 in a spherical isothermal halo potential . here",
    ", @xmath46 is a scale - length that describes when the density turns over .",
    "a typical estimate of its value might be @xmath47 ( @xcite ) .",
    "let the anisotropy be defined as @xmath48 this simple ansatz allows the kinematics to change from azimuthal anisotropy to radial anisotropy or vice versa . here , @xmath49 is the value of the anisotropy at infinity , whereas @xmath50 is a scale - length on which the anisotropy changes .",
    "the solution of the spherical jeans equation is readily found by the method of integrating factors as ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath51 the azimuthal dispersions now follow from ( 9 ) .",
    "the isotropic model has @xmath52 and @xmath53 and a mass estimate ( given by eq .",
    "6 ) of @xmath54 .",
    "this can be reduced by anisotropy .",
    "the microlensing mass estimate in the plane of the asymptotic anisotropy @xmath49 and the anisotropy scale @xmath50 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "for this set of jeans solutions  in which the anisotropy can change significantly but not dramatically  there is no hope of using anisotropy by itself to reduce the microlensing mass estimate below @xmath55 .",
    "if the density of the microlenses is smooth and decreasing , then they can not be brown dwarfs .",
    "this holds irrespective of the details of their kinematics .",
    "this general result follows because the jeans equations ( or , equivalently , the virial theorem ) imply the existence of an irreducible minimum kinetic energy to support the lensing population against gravity . even in the optimum alignment of the velocity dispersion tensor of the lenses",
    ", this must yield sufficient transverse motion so that the minimum mass is @xmath0 for halo models with flat rotation curves .",
    "this is above the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "there is a way to save brown dwarfs .",
    "let us imagine a collection of demons sitting on the microlensing tube .",
    "one of the demons at a heliocentric distance of 20 kpc launches a brown dwarf of mass @xmath56 with a velocity of @xmath57 across our line of sight ... and this causes event # 4 with a blended timescale of 39.5 days . a second demon sitting on the microlensing tube at 30 kpc lobs a brown dwarf with a velocity of just @xmath58 ... and this gives event # 5 with a blended timescale of 55.5 days , and so on",
    "of course , demons can exactly reproduce the dataset reported by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by dropping brown dwarfs from the microlensing tube .",
    "the density of brown dwarfs so produced is neither spherical nor axisymmetric nor in a steady - state .",
    "the velocity distribution is not dynamically well - mixed and the time averages theorem ( binney & tremaine 1987 , p. 171 ) , which is the fundamental result underpinning steady - state stellar dynamics , does not hold . if it did , we could infer the existence of further brown dwarfs at different phases of the same orbits and show that they produce microlensing events that are not seen .",
    "such a model is possible if the halo is very blobby ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "then , in every direction that one looks ( including @xmath59 ) , there may be garbage heaps of brown dwarfs whose density and velocity distributions are lumpy .",
    "this possibility can not be ruled out from the microlensing data - set alone .",
    "most of this work was done during a visit to sissa , trieste .",
    "nwe wishes to thank the astrophysics sector in general , and dennis sciama and john miller in particular , for their kindness and their hospitality .",
    "nwe thanks james binney for numerous insightful remarks on this subject ."
