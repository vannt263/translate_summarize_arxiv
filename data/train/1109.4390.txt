    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions has proven highly successful as its predictions have been confirmed with a high precision at particle colliders",
    ". the only missing ingredient of this theory is the higgs boson , which plays an essential role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "a global fit to electroweak precision data collected at lep and tevatron @xcite suggests that the higgs boson mass , @xmath5 , is below 209 gev . since @xmath5 receives quadratically divergent contributions at the one - loop level from the top quark , the gauge bosons , and the higgs boson itself , fine - tuning",
    "would be required to get a relatively light @xmath5 .",
    "the problem would worsen if the new physics scale was of the order of the planck scale .",
    "this is known as the little hierarchy problem , which remains among the unanswered puzzles of the sm .",
    "although supersymmetry has long been known as a promising prospect to solve the hierarchy problem , very recently little higgs models @xcite have emerged as an interesting alternative to stabilize the higgs boson mass without fine - tuning .",
    "this class of theories are based on the old hypothesis that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson arising from a spontaneously broken approximate global symmetry at a scale of the order of a few tevs . after a collective symmetry breaking mechanism",
    "is introduced , there is a set of new particles that play the role of partners of the sm gauge bosons and the top quark .",
    "the couplings of these new particles are such that the quadratic divergences to @xmath5 arising at one - loop from the sm particles are exactly canceled by the contribution of their respective partners , thereby yielding a naturally light higgs boson .",
    "several realizations of this idea have been proposed in the literature , such as the littlest higgs model ( lhm ) @xcite , the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lhtm ) @xcite , which is actually an extension of the latter , and the simplest little higgs model ( slhm ) @xcite .",
    "little higgs models predict effects that may show up at the 1 tev level , so the study of their phenomenology could be at the reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) or a future @xmath6 linear collider .",
    "the scale of the global symmetry breaking as well as other parameters of little higgs models have been constrained from low energy electroweak measurements @xcite and the respective phenomenology has been widely studied throughout the last years @xcite .",
    "even if the new particles predicted by little higgs models were too heavy to be directly produced at particle colliders , they could show - up via loop effects in particle observables .",
    "apart from reproducing the sm at the electroweak scale , little higgs models predict heavy partners for the top quark and the weak gauge bosons , which are necessary to cancel the quadratic divergences of the higgs boson mass at the one - loop level .",
    "there can also be a massive partner for the photon , as well as new scalar particles and additional fermions , but their presence is more dependent on the particular implementation of the model . in this work",
    "we will concentrate our attention on the extra neutral gauge boson that is the partner of the sm weak gauge boson .",
    "as explained below , it can give a more robust signal of the model at particle colliders than a heavy photon .",
    "an extra neutral gauge boson arises in models in which the sm group is extended with an extra gauge group or if it is embedded into a larger gauge group , such as occurs in the left - right symmetric model , grand unified theories , 331 models , extra dimension theories , technicolor models , the twin - left right symmetric model , etc .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the literature has been mainly devoted to the study of the extra neutral gauge boson associated with an extra @xmath7 gauge group @xcite , which is customarily denoted by @xmath8 . in the lhm and its t - parity extension , the @xmath9 gauge boson partner , denoted by @xmath0 ,",
    "is associated with the additional @xmath10 gauge group . in these models there",
    "is also a heavy photon partner , @xmath11 , which is the lightest new particle and is the analogue of the @xmath7 @xmath8 gauge boson .",
    "although this gauge boson has a great potential to hint the first lhm evidences at a particle collider , it has been argued that it would not offer a robust signal of the model due to the arbitrariness of the charge assignments of the sm fermions under the @xmath7 gauge group .",
    "as far as the slhm is concerned , the role of the @xmath9 partner , which is denoted by @xmath8 , is played by a linear combination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 gauge fields .",
    "this model also predicts a new no self conjugate extra neutral gauge boson , @xmath14 . from now on ,",
    "the @xmath15 letter will denote the extra neutral gauge boson that plays the role of the partner of the @xmath9 gauge boson in little higgs models .",
    "when we refer to a particular model version , we will use the customary notation to refer to this extra neutral gauge boson .",
    "it is not possible to obtain a model - independent bound on the mass of an extra neutral gauge boson from experimental measurements , but electroweak precision data @xcite along with tevatron @xcite and lep2 @xcite searches , allow one to obtain limits on @xmath16 from about @xmath17 gev to @xmath18 gev in models with universal flavor gauge couplings .",
    "since the mass of the new heavy gauge bosons predicted by little higgs models are of the the order of @xmath19 , a bound on @xmath19 translates into an indirect bound on @xmath20 .",
    "while an extra neutral gauge boson with a mass around 4 - 5 tev may be detected at the lhc , the future international linear collider would be able to produce it with a mass up to 2 - 5 tev @xcite .",
    "this would open up potential opportunities to study the phenomenology of this particle and even study some of its rare decays .",
    "since an extra neutral gauge boson may prove useful to find out the particular little higgs model from which it arises , we are interested in studying its decay modes into a pair of neutral gauge bosons , @xmath21 ( @xmath2 ) , which arise at the one - loop level but may have a sizable branching ratio similar to that of a tree - level three - body decay .",
    "these decays , which are interesting as their rate is dictated by the mechanism of anomaly cancellation , have already been studied in the context of a superstring - inspired @xmath22 model @xcite , the minimal 331 model @xcite , and 5d warped - space models @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 decays into three neutral gauge bosons were also studied in the framework of the minimal 331 model @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a survey of little higgs models , with particular emphasis on the gauge sector and the properties of the extra neutral gauge boson @xmath15 that is the partner of the @xmath9 boson .",
    "section iii is devoted to present the calculation of the one - loop decays @xmath21 ( @xmath23 ) in the lhm and the slhm . in order to calculate the respective branching ratios",
    ", we will also discuss the dominant decay modes of the @xmath15 boson arising at the tree - level .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv will be devoted to discuss the results , including some remarks on the experimental possibilities to measure the @xmath21 decays at the lhc and a future linear collider .",
    "the idea that the higgs boson is light because it is a pseudo - goldstone boson arising from an approximately broken global symmetry associated with a strongly interacting sector was explored long ago @xcite .",
    "the drawback of those models is that , due to the fact that a goldstone boson can only have derivative couplings , its gauge and yukawa couplings would necessarily violate the global symmetry . as a consequence",
    ", these interactions would generate radiatively a mass term for the goldstone boson , which would be of the same order as the one appearing in models in which no global symmetry is present , thereby preventing a light higgs boson unless fine - tuning is reintroduced . a solution to this problem",
    "was suggested by arkani - hamed , cohen and georgi @xcite . by invoking a collective mechanism of symmetry breaking ( the goldstone bosons are parametrized by",
    "a nonlinear sigma model which apart from a global symmetry under the group @xmath24 has a local symmetry under the subgroup @xmath25 ) , the gauge and yukawa couplings of the goldstone boson are introduced in such a way that the higgs boson mass is free of quadratic divergences at the one - loop or even at the two - loop level . in the fermion sector",
    "it is necessary to introduce a new vector - like top quark ( top partner ) to cancel the quadratically divergent contribution to the higgs boson mass from the top quark loops .",
    "this idea can be implemented in several ways , but there are basically two different types of little higgs models @xcite : product group models , in which the sm gauge group is the diagonal subgroup of a larger gauge group , and simple group models , in which the sm gauge group is embedded into a larger gauge group .",
    "models that fall into each category are the lhm , which is based on the @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] product gauge group , and the slhm , which has gauge symmetry under the @xmath27 simple group .",
    "these models share features common to other models of the same class , so the study of their phenomenology may shed light on the properties of similar models . as stated above , we will concentrate on two particular little higgs models , namely , the lhm , @xcite and the slhm @xcite .",
    "we will not consider the lhm with t - parity as the decays we are interested in are forbidden in that model . instead of discussing with detail the theoretical framework of these models",
    ", we will content ourselves with focusing on those topics essential for our discussion .",
    "a detailed description can be found in the original works .",
    "the most economic and most popular version of little higgs models is the lhm @xcite .",
    "however , electroweak precision measurements put stringent constraints on the scale of the symmetry breaking , @xmath19 , of the order of 4 tev @xcite , rendering the model somewhat unattractive .",
    "there is still a small region of parameter space in which @xmath19 can be as low as 2 tev .",
    "this problem is alleviated if the model is extended by invoking t parity @xcite , a discrete symmetry analogue to r - parity , the symmetry introduced in supersymmetric models .",
    "however , in this version of the model the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) decays are forbidden due to t - parity .",
    "the lhm is a nonlinear sigma model with a global symmetry under the @xmath28 group and a gauged subgroup @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the goldstone bosons are parametrized by the following @xmath30 field @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the pion matrix .",
    "the @xmath30 field transforms under the gauge group as @xmath33 , with @xmath34 an element of the gauge group .",
    "the @xmath28 global symmetry is broken down to @xmath35 by the sigma field vev , @xmath36 , which is of the order of the scale of the symmetry breaking .",
    "after the global symmetry is broken , 14 goldstone bosons arise accommodated in multiplets of the electroweak gauge group : a real singlet , a real triplet , a complex triplet and a complex doublet .",
    "the latter will be identified with the sm higgs doublet . at this stage ,",
    "the gauge symmetry is also broken down to its diagonal subgroup , @xmath37 .",
    "the real singlet and the real triplet are absorbed by the gauge bosons associated with the broken gauge symmetry .",

    "the vev @xmath36 generates masses for the gauge bosons and mixing between them .",
    "the heavy gauge boson mass eigenstates are given by @xcite @xmath48 with masses @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the orthogonal combinations of gauge bosons are identified with the sm gauge bosons : @xmath51 which remain massless at this stage , their couplings being given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are mixing parameters ( here @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "the gauge and yukawa interactions that break the global @xmath35 symmetry induce radiatively a coleman - weinberg potential , @xmath58 , whose explicit form can be obtained after expanding the @xmath30 field : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 depend on the fundamental parameters of the model , whereas @xmath63 , which receives logarithmic divergent contributions at one - loop level and quadratically divergent contributions at the two - loop level , is treated as a free parameter of the order of @xmath64 .",
    "the coleman - weinberg potential induces a mass term for the complex triplet @xmath65 , whose components acquire a mass of the order of @xmath19 . the neutral component of the complex doublet develops a vev , @xmath66 , of the order of the electroweak scale , which is responsible for ewsb .",
    "the vev @xmath66 along with the triplet vev , @xmath67 , are obtained when @xmath58 is minimized .    at the electroweak scale ,",
    "ewsb proceeds as usual , yielding the final mass eigenstates : the three sm gauge bosons are accompanied by three heavy gauge bosons which are their counterpart , @xmath11 , @xmath68 and @xmath0 .",
    "the masses of the heavy gauge bosons get corrected by terms of the order of @xmath69 and so are the masses of the weak gauge bosons @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the heavy gauge boson masses are given by @xcite :    @xmath72    @xmath73    with @xmath74 , being @xmath75 and @xmath76 the sine and cosine of the weinberg angle @xmath77 , while @xmath78 .",
    "in the scalar sector , after diagonalizing the higgs mass matrix , the light higgs boson mass can be obtained at the leading order @xcite @xmath79    it is required that @xmath80 to obtain the correct electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum with @xmath81 .",
    "the higgs triplet masses are degenerate at this order :    @xmath82    in summary , in the gauge sector there are four new gauge bosons @xmath83 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 , while in the scalar sector there are new neutral , singly charged and doubly charged higgs scalars , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , together with one pseudoscalar boson @xmath87 .",

    "the remaining terms of the lhm lagrangian and all the feynman rules for the new interactions were given in @xcite .",

    "notice that while the inclusion of the top partner is necessary to cancel the higgs boson mass quadratic divergences at the one - loop level , it is not necessary to include additional partners for the light fermions .",
    "the three lepton families transform similarly under the gauge group and include one new neutral lepton @xmath155 for each generation : @xmath156 where @xmath157 stands for the family index and the gauge quantum numbers appear in the parenthesis . in the quark sector , a new quark for each family is necessary .",

    "<S> these decays are induced at the one - loop level by a fermion triangle and are interesting as they are strongly dependent on the mechanism of anomaly cancellation . all the relevant tree - level two- and three - body decays of the @xmath0 gauge boson are also calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the branching ratios for the @xmath3 decays can be as large as that of a tree - level three - body decay but the @xmath4 decay is very suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the experimental prospects for detecting these decays at the lhc and a future linear collider . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the latter would offer more chances for the detection of such rare decays . </S>"
