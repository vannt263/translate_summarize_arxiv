    "let us note that if the efficiencies of the two periodically poled sections are different we can achieve a maximally entangled state , i.e. @xmath62 , by adjusting the pump power in order to compensate for the different efficiencies .",

    "we recall here the transformation induced by the pbs : @xmath9 here @xmath13 are the transmissivity and reflectivity of a photon with polarization @xmath12 in either modes .",

    "deviations from these ideal values increase the probability of having two photons in the same output and consequently decrease the probability of generating the desired entangled state .",
    "we can define the probability of generating the entangled state as follows : @xmath64 this probability is plot in fig .",

    "we can clearly see that this probability decreases faster as @xmath65 and @xmath66 deviate from the ideal values when @xmath67 , i.e when we want to generate @xmath70 .",
    "this is the effect of path interference which is constructive for @xmath68 and destructive for @xmath67 . with the parameters adopted in our experiment we are able to generate @xmath70 with probability @xmath24 while @xmath71 is generated with probability @xmath72     ( top ) and @xmath71 ( bottom ) as a function of transmission for h and v polarizations .",
    "ideal values are @xmath73 and @xmath74 which correspond to a probability @xmath75 .",

    "it consists of a central section with length @xmath82 in which the two waveguide branches merge into a single waveguide with width @xmath83 which is twice the width of the single waveguides .",
    "a linear branching is performed to separate the two waveguides , i.e. the single waveguides are inclined by an angle @xmath84 . to avoid problems with the lithography in the range in which the waveguide separation is smaller than @xmath85 a single tapered waveguide with increasing width is chosen ( @xmath86 region in the drawing ) . in our design @xmath77 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "parametric down conversion is a nonlinear process where a photon from a bright field at frequency @xmath89 decays into two daughter photons at lower frequencies .    .",
    "in the case of picosecond pump pulses ( top ) the orientation of the jsa is dominated by the pm function while in the case of narrow band pump light ( bottom ) the orientation of the jsa is fixed by the pump envelope . in this second case by exchanging signal and idler -i.e . by mirroring the jsa with respect to the @xmath90 line ( blue dashed)- the two jsas completely overlap , a condition corresponding to complete spectral indistinguishability between signal and idler . ]    for this process to occur , energy and momentum must be conserved .",
    "momentum conservation is represented by the so called `` phase matching function '' which depends on the material ( in our case lithium niobate ) properties and the waveguide geometry .",
    "the energy conservation is ensured by the relation @xmath91 where the subscripts @xmath35 stay for pump , signal and idler respectively . on the plane",

    "the final spectral properties of the pdc photons are represented on this plane by the joint spectral amplitude ( jsa ) which is the product of the phase matching ( pm ) function and the pump envelope . for a type ii degenerate process in lithium niobate for our wavelength combination the pm function",
    "is aligned at @xmath93 ( blue solid lines ) .",
    "the jsa will result in an ellipse whose orientation depends on the pump bandwidth : when the pump is broad the orientation of the jsa is dominated by the pm function ( fig .",

    "[ fig : jsa ] bottom ) .",
    "the spectral indistinguishability of the generated photon pairs is directly connected to the orientation of the jsa .",
    "indeed the spectral indistinguishability can be quantified by looking at the overlap between the jsa and the jsa obtained by exchanging signal and idler axes .",
    "this corresponds to mirror the jsa on the @xmath94 line in the plane @xmath92 ( blue dashed line in fig . [",
    "fig : jsa ] ) and look at the overlap between the original and the mirrored jsas .",
    "a perfect overlap is ensured when the jsa is oriented at @xmath49 , while it decreases as the orientation deviates from this optimal value . with picosecond pump pulses of @xmath95 bandwidth , as set in our experiment , the overlap is @xmath96 . in this configuration",
    "we adopted narrowband filters at the output of our device in order to eliminate the distinguishability of signal and idler spectra and consequently increase the entanglement .",

    "<S> walk off we adopt polarization maintaining fibers ( pmfs ) and let the fast polarized photon travel through the slow axis of the fiber and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the fibers @xmath42 is chosen such that the delay between h and v in the fiber is @xmath43 @xmath44 being the birefringence of the pmf . in our experiment </S>",

    "<S> however , for some applications , such a temporal compensation can be applied after the total evolution of the two - photon states through a linear network ; in this case the pmfs can be considered part of the detection scheme , implying that the presence of the pmfs does not prevent the possibility of directly interfacing this ln chip with other integrated circuits .    </S>",
    "<S> a second source of distinguishability that we should prevent or compensate is a possible non - perfect overlap between the pdc spectra of h and v photons . </S>",
    "<S> this is directly related to symmetry of the joint spectral amplitude ( jsa ) of the pdc light produced in each waveguide ( see supplementary material for more details ) . for a type ii process , where orthogonally polarized pairs are emitted </S>",
    "<S> , this condition is true only when the pump bandwidth is small enough to ensure a jsa oriented at @xmath49 in the plane of signal and idler wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> this case correspond to a process driven by cw pump light . on the contrary the use of pulses results in an asymmetry of the jsa and a consequent difference in the bandwidths of the spectra for h and v photons . in this case </S>",
    "<S> spectral filters have to be introduced . </S>",
    "<S> we pumped our source with both cw and picosecond pulses . in the case of pulsed light we adopted fiber bragg grating ( fbg ) filters which , as in the case of pmfs , can be considered part of the source or of the detection scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the setup for quantum measurements is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : setup ] : it can be divided in three sections : the pump preparation setup , the source itself and the analysis setup . </S>",
    "<S> the pump preparation setup consists of a loop : here a diagonally polarized beam is split on a bulk pbs and fed into a sagnac loop . </S>",
    "<S> the two beams are recombined on the pbs , however , no interference occurs because a displacement between them is introduced by tilting one mirror ( @xmath50 ) of the loop . </S>",
    "<S> this displacement is imaged to the separation between the two input waveguides of the chip through a set of lenses ( not shown in the picture ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a configuration ensures a common path geometry for the two pump beams such that their relative phase remains constant in time . </S>",
    "<S> the desired phase @xmath8 between them is then set via a liquid crystal device ( lcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the loop a half waveplate and another pbs are used to set the polarization state of both beams ( horizontal ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that by properly rotating the waveplates before and after the sagnac loop we are able to pump only waveguide 1 or waveguide 2 and generate separable states , or both at the same time and generate polarization entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the second part of the setup is the source itself : the ln chip which generates the polarization entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> the last part is the analysis setup : pmfs are used for temporal delay compensation . in our scheme </S>",
    "<S> we chose to use a free space coupling but it is also possible to directly interface a fiber array of pmfs to the output of the chip , as the waveguide separation at the output matches the standard separation between fibers in fiber arrays ( @xmath51 ) . in the case of </S>",
    "<S> pulsed pump beams fbg filters with bandwidth @xmath52 are inserted to apply spectral filtering . </S>",
    "<S> standard polarization analysis components and superconducting nanowires single photon detectors ( snspd , quantum opus ) are used to characterize the state . </S>",
    "<S> coincidence counts between the two outputs are recorded .        by measuring single counts and coincidences between the two snspds we evaluated the high brightness of our source to be @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in order to characterize our quantum state , we performed a quantum state tomography @xcite to reconstruct the density matrix describing the produced state . </S>",
    "<S> we set the pump wavelength at @xmath54 to ensure spectral degeneracy and measured all the possible polarization states projections . </S>",
    "<S> real and imaginary parts of the experimental density matrix are reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qst ] _ a , b _ for pulsed and in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qst ] _ c , d _ for cw pump light . for pulsed pump light </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity ( overlap ) between the measured state and the singlet state of the bell basis is @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is mainly affected by the imperfect splitting ratio of the pbs on chip , residual temporal mismatch and possible slight mismatch of the central peak of the adopted fbgs . </S>",
    "<S> we then performed a bell test according to the scheme of clause , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh ) @xcite and obtained a value of the @xmath56-parameter of @xmath57 corresponding to a violation of more than 14 standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> we performed the same measurements with a cw pump and no filters and obtained a fidelity of @xmath58 and s - parameter @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> this fidelity is lower compared to the pulsed pump case because of slightly different properties between the two poled waveguides ( shown already in the shg measurements ) . </S>",
    "<S> however this can be improved in the fabrication process .    </S>",
    "<S> these results show that our fully integrated source of polarization entangled states has high quality performances that make it the optimal candidate to replace bulk sources commonly adopted in quantum information setups . in this device , </S>",
