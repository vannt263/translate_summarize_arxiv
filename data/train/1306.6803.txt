    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( a ) renders the dependence of the computed @xmath52 with @xmath0 , for different arrays of ribbons , showing clearly that sub - micrometer graphene ribbons produce maxima in the faraday rotation at frequencies that would only be achievable in a continuous graphene sheet at much larger magnetic fields . if these large magnetic field are achievable , a continuous sheet would produce a larger faraday angle . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( c ) , which shows the ratio between @xmath56 in a graphene sheet and @xmath57 in the ribbon , @xmath58 , evaluated at the resonant frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows that the decrease in magnetic field needed to obtain high faraday angles in ribbons , with respect to the situation in a continuous sheet , comes at a decrease in the maximum faraday angle ( @xmath59 ) . as the magnetic field increases , </S>",
    "<S> so does @xmath60 and , when the magnetic field is high enough ( so that the magnetoplasmons frequency in ribbons tend to the cyclotron frequency ) , @xmath61 is limited by the filling fraction @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> another way to obtain faraday rotation at higher frequencies in a continuous graphene sheet is by reducing the chemical potential . in order to compare the response of 2d graphene and the ribbon array , we define an effective chemical potential @xmath63 such that the spectral position of maximum @xmath3 is the same for a _ continuous _ graphene sheet at @xmath63 and for the ribbon array under the actual @xmath55 ( with all other parameters , like @xmath54 , @xmath0 , etc . </S>",

    "<S> notice however , that the strategy of increasing the frequency of resonant faraday rotation in a continuous sheet by decreasing the chemical potential is limited by the condition @xmath65 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( c ) this is reflected in the fact that the different curves have end - points at the lower chemical potentials that fulfill the previous condition . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( d ) , ribbon arrays can provide , at a given magnetic field and a given frequency , a substantially larger faraday rotation than a continuous graphene sheet . </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) faraday rotation at various magnetic fields . ( b ) zeroth - order transmission . ]    up to now we have considered a value for the carrier mobility in graphene that is routinely produced nowadays . however , in view of the recent advances in producing high - quality graphene samples , it is interesting to consider which faraday rotation would be achievable at ultrahigh mobilities . for that , it is valuable to know whether there are physical limits to what can be achievable . </S>",
    "<S> a well - known example of these limits is that the maximum possible absorption by a free standing infinitely thin sheet is @xmath67@xcite . concerning the change in polarization </S>",
    "<S> , we find that in a free - standing infinitely thin sheet , characterized by a local conductivity , the modulus each of the zero - order cross - polarization amplitudes have a maximum value of 1/2 ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is , @xmath68 by structuring graphene , we can not increase this limiting value . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can largely improve the resonance q - factor ( the gmp resonance is less absorptive , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a),(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications for the faraday rotation . in a continuous translational - invariant sheet </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown ( ( see supplementary information ) that the maximal faraday angle is @xmath69 which , of course , is already an impressive result , even more so for a one - atom - thick layer . remarkably , </S>",
    "<S> faraday rotation on graphene ribbon arrays can exceed this value . </S>",
    "<S> as was previously shown,@xcite the transmission coefficient @xmath22 be very low . </S>",
    "<S> if we set @xmath70 in eq .  , we immediately obtain @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , which shows the computed transmittance and faraday angle , for both arrays a and b , for the case @xmath26  ps . </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows that the faraday angle strongly depends on scattering time and that in ribbons it may even exceed that of a continuous graphene sheet ( and , as stated above , at larger frequencies ) .     the results for ribbon arrays ( solid curves ) and continuous graphene ( dashed curves ) placed on top of the substrate with @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) faraday rotation at various magnetic fields . ( b ) zeroth - order transmission . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation time is @xmath27  ps . ]    in all the previous calculations , we have considered free - standing graphene ( @xmath34 ) because the fundamental physics we were discussing ( the influence of excitation of gsp on the faraday rotation ) was already present in this simple configuration . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in practice , graphene is usually produced on a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence of this is that carrier mobility is reduced , due to scattering with phonons and charged impurities . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , although the presence of a substrate does not significantly affect the polarization rotation in a continuous graphene sheet , this may not be the case for graphene ribbons , as plasmon excitations are very sensitive to the surrounding medium . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of a substrate on the gsp - enhanced faraday rotation of graphene ribbons is exemplary illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] , for one of the ribbon arrays considered in this work placed on a semi infinite substrate characterized by a non - dispersive dielectric permittivity @xmath73 . as the figure shows , the blue shifts of the maximum in the faraday angle occurring when graphene is patterned are still present , although they are reduced by the presence of the dielectric substrate ( as can be seen by the comparison with fig  [ fig3](b ) ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that , for a given magnetic field and chemical potential , structuring graphene periodically can produce strong faraday rotation at larger frequencies than what would occur in a continuous graphene sheet . alternatively , at a given frequency , graphene ribbons produce giant faraday rotation at much smaller magnetic fields than in continuous graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that this enhancement of faraday rotation in arrays of graphene ribbons is produced by the resonant coupling of radiation to graphene magnetoplasmons . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to control the graphene magnetoplasmon frequency through both geometry and magnetic field , combined with the possibility to modify the carrier density by an external gate voltage , holds an exciting promise for designing dynamically tunable devices employing solely the magneto - optical properties of graphene .    20    supplementary information </S>"
