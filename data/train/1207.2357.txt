    "the main difficulty is getting the nuclei close enough to fuse since they should overcome a high coulomb barrier .",
    "there are two ways to pass the coulomb barrier , to accelerate the nuclei up to a high energy comparable with the barrier height ( of the order of @xmath0 ) or to pass the barrier via quantum tunneling .",
    "when the energy is not high , the probability of tunneling of the nuclei through the coulomb barrier is extremely small according to the theory of wentzel , kramers , and brillouin ( wkb ) @xcite .",
    "so only high energy nuclei can fuse .",
    "therefore , high energy nuclei is the leading idea of fusion technique .",
    "we mention an acceleration of initially cold deuterons by a strong electric field using a pyroelectric crystal @xcite .",
    "it is surprising to claim that _ two bare deuterons _ , that is isolated from everything , _ of room temperature energy _",
    "are able , in principle , to penetrate the coulomb barrier with a not small probability and to subsequently fuse .",
    "this statement is counterintuitive .",
    "a tennis ball can not penetrate through a brick wall .",
    "this correlates with the usual underbarrier physics led by the philosophy of addition of probabilities but not amplitudes .",
    "the proposed phenomenon of barrier penetration is based ultimately on interference that is on addition of amplitudes .",
    "we really deal with two low - energy nuclei in vacuum .",
    "there are no external sources ( electric or magnetic field , illumination , surrounding matter , traps , etc . ) which may accelerate them .",
    "the energy of the two nuclei , in the system of center of mass , is conserved and remains small during the motion through the coulomb barrier .",
    "this is a substantial difference from usual schemes to push in action a mechanism of low - energy fusion by some local heating or acceleration of nuclei .",
    "the conventional scattering problem is a study of reflection of the incident flux which is a plane wave coming from large distances @xcite . in the coulomb field",
    "scattering relates to the rutherford formula and the wave function is exponentially small at the center .",
    "what happens when the incident flux at large distances is not just a single plane wave ?",
    "the wave function close to the coulomb center can be substantially modified when the incident flux is a superposition of plane waves with the same energy and various directions , for example , a convergent conical wave . in this case",
    "classical trajectories are reflected , due to coulomb forces , from the certain surface surrounding the cone axis .",
    "this surface is called caustic @xcite and it is terminated by the cusp directed to the center .",
    "classical trajectories fill out the space restricted by the caustic surface .",
    "each incident trajectory reflects from the caustic surface , continues inside , and pierces its opposite part .",
    "so the space outside the caustic is not an absolute shadow from the classical standpoint .",
    "classical trajectories , which pierce the surface of the cusp caustic , do not reach the coulomb center since they are reflected from another caustic closer to the center .",
    "so the coulomb center is in the absolute shadow .",
    "otherwise it would be strange to get the center reachable within classical physics .",
    "unlike classical physics , a caustic shadow is not completely \" empty  due to an exponential decay of the wave function outside the caustic surface @xcite .",
    "the proper outer flux of the cusp caustic is directed along it . when the flux reaches the cusp it gets away from it and moves towards the center .",
    "it pierces the caustic which reflects the above classical flux propagated after piercing the cusp caustic .",
    "then it reaches the coulomb center providing a not exponentially small probability of tunneling .",
    "the cusp driven flux does not exist in classical physics . the analogous flux , getting away from a caustic cusp , is also formed in optics and acoustics .    in this paper the semiclassical method , based on hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite ,",
    "the phenomenon of interference in tunneling was already proposed in refs .  @xcite .",
