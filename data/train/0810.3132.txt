    "since the introduction of cluster algebras by fomin and zelevinsky @xcite , relationships between such algebras and interesting topics in several branches of mathematics have emerged .",
    "the project of modelling cluster algebras in a representation theoretic setting was initiated in @xcite .",
    "inspired by this , cluster categories were defined in @xcite to be certain orbit categories obtained from the derived category of hom - finite hereditary abelian categories .",
    "these categories have been widely studied for the case when the initial hereditary category is the category of finite dimensional representations of an acyclic quiver @xmath1 .",
    "( when @xmath1 is a quiver with underlying graph @xmath2 , the cluster category was independently defined in @xcite . )",
    "it has then been shown that the indecomposable rigid objects are in bijection with the cluster variables in the cluster algebra @xmath3 associated with the same quiver , and under this bijection the clusters correspond to the maximal rigid objects ( @xcite based on @xcite , see also @xcite ) . moreover , by @xcite , the quiver of the endomorphism ring of a maximal rigid object is the same as the quiver of the corresponding cluster .",
    "the last phenomenon also appears for maximal rigid modules in the stable module category of preprojective algebras of simply laced dynkin type @xcite , which is another example of a hom - finite 2-calabi - yau triangulated category .",
    "inspired by this and @xcite , @xcite , an axiomatic framework for mutation in 2-cy categories was defined in @xcite .",
    "the essential features were considered to be : the unique exchange of indecomposable summands ; the fact that exchange pairs were related by approximation triangles ; and the fact that on the level of endomorphism rings , exchange of indecomposable summands led to fomin - zelevinsky quiver mutation on the gabriel quivers . for the third of these features to make sense",
    ", one must require that the endomorphism rings have no loops or 2-cycles in their quivers .",
    "in @xcite it was also shown that the collection of maximal rigid objects in any hom - finite 2-cy triangulated category fulfils these axioms for cluster structures whenever the quivers of their endomorphism rings do not have loops or 2-cycles .",
    "the cluster structures from @xcite have two limitations :",
    "firstly , there exist hom - finite 2-cy triangulated categories where the endomorphism rings of maximal rigid objects do have loops and 2-cycles in their quivers .",
    "the unique exchange property holds also in these categories @xcite , but fz quiver mutation does not make sense in this setting . secondly , the cluster algebras which can be modelled from the cases studied in @xcite are the ones defined from quivers ( equivalently , skew - symmetric matrices ) , while cluster algebras can be defined also from more general matrices .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the notion of cluster structures from @xcite .",
    "we show that the set of maximal rigid objects in a hom - finite 2-cy triangulated category satisfies this new definition of cluster structure regardless of whether the endomorphism rings have loops or not .",
    "( we must however assume that the quivers do not have 2-cycles . )",
    "one effect of this is that we will also relax the second limitation , since the cluster algebras which can be modelled in this new setting but not in the setting of @xcite are defined from matrices which are not necessarily skew - symmetric .",
    "while previous investigations of cluster structures have regarded the quiver of the endomorphism ring as the essential combinatorial data , our approach is to emphasize the exchange triangles instead .",
    "we collect the information from the exchange triangles in a matrix and require for our cluster structure that exchange of indecomposable objects leads to fz matrix mutation of this matrix . in the no - loop situation considered in @xcite ,",
    "the matrix defined here is the same as the one describing the quiver of the endomorphism ring , so our definition is an extension of the definition in @xcite .    in the cluster category defined from a module category of a hereditary algebra ,",
    "the maximal rigid objects are the same as the _ cluster - tilting _ objects . in general , however , the cluster - tilting condition is stronger , and there exist categories where the maximal rigid objects are not cluster - tilting .",
    "examples of this in a geometrical setting are given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a class of examples from a purely representation - theoretical setting , namely the cluster categories @xmath4 defined from _ tubes _ @xmath5 . here , the tube @xmath5 is the category of nilpotent representations of a quiver with underlying graph @xmath6 and with cyclic orientation .",
    "the category @xmath4 has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of cluster categories from tubes is that the endomorphism rings of the maximal rigid objects have quivers with loops , but not 2-cycles .",
    "thus they are covered by the definition of cluster structures in this paper , but not by the one in @xcite .",
    "we will show that the set of rigid objects in @xmath4 is a model of the exchange combinatorics of a type @xmath0 cluster algebra . to this end",
    ", we give a bijection between the indecomposable rigid objects in @xmath4 and the cluster variables in a type @xmath7 cluster algebra such that the maximal rigid objects correspond to the clusters .",
    "this bijection is via the _ cyclohedron _ , or bott - taubes polytope @xcite .",
    "also , we will see that the matrix defined from the exchange triangles associated to a maximal rigid object is the same as the one belonging to the corresponding cluster in the cluster algebra .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section [",
    "section : clusterstructures ] we give the new definition of cluster structures and show that the set of maximal rigid objects in a hom - finite 2-cy category satisfies this definition whenever there are no 2-cycles in the quivers of their endomorphism rings . in section [ section : maxrigidintubes ] we give a complete description of the maximal rigid objects in the cluster category of a tube .",
    "finally , in section [ section : relationshiptypeb ] , we show that the cluster structure in a cluster tube forms a good model of the combinatorics of a type @xmath0 cluster algebra .",
    "in this section we generalise the notion of _ cluster structures _ from @xcite to include situations where the quivers of the clusters may have loops .",
    "we then proceed to show that the set of maximal rigid objects in a hom - finite 2-calabi - yau category admits a cluster structure with this new definition , under the assumption that the gabriel quivers of their endomorphism rings do not have 2-cycles .",
    "let @xmath8 be some field . by a hom - finite @xmath8-category we will mean a category @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a finite dimensional @xmath8-vector space for all pairs of indecomposable objects @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we will normally suppress the field @xmath8 . a triangulated category @xmath9 is said to be calabi - yau of dimension 2 , or 2-cy , if @xmath13 for all objects @xmath14 of @xmath9 and all @xmath15 in @xmath16 . for the remainder of this section",
    ", @xmath9 will denote a hom - finite 2-calabi - yau triangulated category .",
    "we now recall the definition of a _ weak cluster structure _ from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a collection of sets of non - isomorphic indecomposable objects of @xmath9 .",
    "each set @xmath18 of indecomposables which is an element of @xmath17 is called a _",
    "precluster_. the collection @xmath17 is said to have a _ weak cluster structure _ if the following two conditions are met :    * for each precluster @xmath19 with @xmath20 indecomposable , there exists a unique indecomposable @xmath21 such that the disjoint union @xmath22 is a precluster . *",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath23 are related by triangles @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are minimal left @xmath27-approximations and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are minimal right @xmath27-approximations .",
    "these triangles are called the _ exchange triangles _ of @xmath20 ( equivalently , of @xmath23 ) with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "we will not distinguish between a precluster and the object obtained by taking the direct sum of the indecomposable objects which form the precluster .",
    "the same goes for subsets of preclusters .",
    "assume now that @xmath17 has a weak cluster structure .",
    "for each @xmath31 in @xmath17 we define a matrix @xmath32 by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the multiplicity of @xmath11 as a direct summand of @xmath12 .",
    "so the matrix @xmath35 records , for each @xmath36 , the difference between the multiplicities of @xmath37 in the two exchange triangles for @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 for all @xmath15 , since @xmath38 does not appear as a summand in the target ( resp .",
    "source ) of a left ( resp .",

    "recall fomin - zelevinsky _ matrix mutation _",
    ", defined in @xcite : for a matrix @xmath41 the mutation at @xmath8 is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 note in particular that for @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 if and only if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both positive or both negative .",
    "we say that @xmath17 has a _ cluster structure _ if @xmath17 has a weak cluster structure , and in addition the following conditions are satisfied :    * for each @xmath48 and each @xmath49 , the objects @xmath50 and @xmath51 have no common direct summands . *",
    "if @xmath52 is an indecomposable object and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are preclusters , then @xmath35 and @xmath55 are related by fomin - zelevinsky matrix mutation at @xmath8 .    in this case , we call the elements of @xmath17 _ clusters_.    an interpretation of condition ( c ) above is that the endomorphism rings of the clusters have gabriel quivers which do not have 2-cycles . it should also be noted that if there are no loops at the vertices corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath37 in these quivers , then the multiplicity of @xmath37 as a summand in the exchange triangle for @xmath38 will equal the number of arrows between these two vertices .",
    "in particular , if there are no loops at any of the vertices , @xmath35 is skew - symmetric and can be considered as a record of the quiver .",
    "condition ( d ) then reduces to fz quiver mutation , so our definition coincides with the definition in @xcite in this case .",
    "an object @xmath18 in a triangulated category @xmath56 is said to be _ rigid _ if @xmath57 .",
    "it is called _ maximal rigid _ if it is maximal with this property , that is , @xmath58 implies that @xmath59 .",
    "the collection of maximal rigid objects in any hom - finite 2-cy triangulated category has a weak cluster structure .",
    "this follows from @xcite , as stated in theorem i.1.10 ( a ) of @xcite .",
    "we can now prove a stronger version of part ( b ) of the same theorem :    [ thmmaxrigidcluster ] let @xmath9 be a hom - finite 2-calabi - yau triangulated category , and let @xmath17 be the collection of maximal rigid objects in @xmath9 .",
    "assume @xmath17 satisfies condition ( c ) above .",
    "then @xmath17 has a cluster structure .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thmmaxrigidcluster ] follows the same lines as the proof of theorem i.1.6 . in @xcite .",
    "we need to show that when an indecomposable summand of a maximal rigid object is exchanged , the change in the matrix is given by fomin - zelevinsky matrix mutation .",
    "the fact that the matrices @xmath35 for maximal rigid @xmath18 are not necessarily skew - symmetric forces us to prove different cases separately . for the proof we will need the following lemma :    [ signskewsymm ] in the situation of the theorem , for any maximal rigid object @xmath18 , @xmath35 is sign skew symmetric , i.e. , for all @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 .    as remarked after the definition of the matrix @xmath35 ,",
    "the diagonal entries @xmath63 vanish , so the statement in the lemma is clearly true for these .",
    "now assume @xmath61 for some @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath37 is a summand of the middle term of the exchange triangle @xmath65 since the second map is a minimal right @xmath40-approximation , this means that there exists a map @xmath66 which does not factor through any other object in @xmath67 . in other words , there is an arrow @xmath66 in the quiver of @xmath68 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath38 is a summand of the middle term in the exchange triangle @xmath69 and thus @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath70 be a maximal rigid object in @xmath9 .",

    "pick two indecomposable summands @xmath74 of @xmath30 , so @xmath60 and @xmath8 are all distinct .    for the purposes of this proof we introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath75 that is , the multiplicity of @xmath76 as a direct summand of the middle term in the exchange triangle ending in @xmath77 with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , we denote the multiplicity of @xmath76 in the other triangle by @xmath79 note that under the assumption of condition ( c ) , at least one of these two numbers will be zero for any choice of @xmath80 .",
    "the exchange triangles for @xmath52 with respect to @xmath30 are @xmath81 @xmath82 note that @xmath83 and @xmath84 do not have @xmath38 or @xmath37 as direct summand .",
    "these are also the exchange triangles for @xmath85 with respect to @xmath30 , but the roles of the middle terms are interchanged .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath86 , and the fz formula holds for row @xmath8 of the matrix .    in the rest of the proof we study the changes in row @xmath15 , where @xmath87 .",
    "for this we also need the exchange triangles for @xmath38 with respect to @xmath88 , which are @xmath89 @xmath90 again , note that @xmath91 and @xmath92 do not have @xmath37 or @xmath52 as direct summand . from these triangles",
    "we must collect information about the exchange triangles of @xmath38 with respect to @xmath93 , since these determine the entries in row @xmath15 of @xmath55 .",
    "we will consider three different cases , depending on whether @xmath46 is positive , negative or zero .    * case i : * assume @xmath94 , that is , @xmath52 does not appear in any of the exchange triangles for @xmath38 .",
    "then , by lemma [ signskewsymm ] , we have @xmath95 as well , and by the above , @xmath96 . by appealing once more to lemma [ signskewsymm ] , we see that @xmath97 does not appear in the exchange triangles for @xmath38 with respect to @xmath98 .",
    "this is enough to establish that the map @xmath99 in triangle is also a minimal left @xmath100-approximation .",
    "similarly , the map @xmath101 in triangle is a minimal right @xmath102-approximation .",
    "this means that the triangles and are also the exchange triangles for @xmath38 with respect to @xmath98 . thus the entries in row @xmath15 remain unchanged and behave according to the fz rule in this situation .",
