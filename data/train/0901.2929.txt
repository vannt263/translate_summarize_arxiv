    "based on computations of the emission from the accretion disks of cataclysmic variables in @xcite , we expect that no more than 20% of the local viscous energy would be emitted as h@xmath12 .",
    "thus the local energy is probably insufficient to power the strong lines , and external illumination of the accretion disk appears necessary to explain the observed line luminosity even for this luminous , and likely efficiently accreting , double - peaked emitter .",
    "the source of the external illumination is still uncertain . for the prototype",
    "double - peaked emitter arp 102b , @xcite proposed that the outer accretion disk was illuminated by a vertical extended structure in the inner disk , such as a geometrically thick and optically thin x - ray - emitting flow produced by radiatively inefficient accretion ( riaf ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", external photons may come from a different kind of disk - illuminating structure , for example , disk photons scattered by electrons in jets or slow outflows as suggested by @xcite .",
    "another open question regarding double - peaked emitters is their connection to the general agn population .",
    "observationally , except for their double - peaked and generally broader emission lines , many double - peaked emitters resemble typical agns ( e.g. , through broad - band optical  to  x - ray seds ) . despite the requirement of illumination of the disk , their x - ray properties",
    "( e.g. , spectra and power output ) do not differ greatly from those of single - peaked agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though recent study suggested enhanced emission relative to the uv / optical emission in a sample of the broadest double - peaked emitters @xcite .",
    "theoretically , all luminous agns are expected to have accretion disks , and keplerian disks are capable of producing double - peaked emission lines .",
    "although the disk parameters , such as the inclination and the ratio of the inner to outer radius , could affect the appearance of the line profile , they are not sufficient to explain why only @xmath97 of agns are double - peaked emitters .",
    "@xcite suggested that a varying optical depth in an accretion - disk wind could determine the presence of single or double - peaked line profiles .",
    "the underlying double - peaked lines become single - peaked due to radiative transfer in a strong radiation - driven disk wind , and therefore double - peaked emission lines are mostly existent in low - luminosity agns , where disk winds are weak with small optical depths . however",
    ", this model can not explain the existence of the most luminous double - peaked emitters , including j0331@xmath02755 .",
    "alternatively , the presence of single or double - peaked emission lines could be related to the structure and kinematics of the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that the blr is highly stratified .",
    "the low - ionization blr could consist of two kinematically distinct regions : an outer region of the accretion disk and a standard kinematically hot broad - line cloud component .",
    "if in the majority of agns line emission from the latter component dominates , we will see single - peaked broad emission lines , while in the remaining @xmath97 we see double - peaked lines from the accretion disk .",
    "however , the detailed structure of the blr is poorly understood .",
    "it seems likely that the small fraction of double - peaked emitters among agns is the result of a combination of these factors , i.e. , the influence of external illumination , the position and inclination of the line - emitting region of the accretion disk , the presence of disk winds , and the complex geometric nature of the blr .",
    "the properties of j0331@xmath02755 indicate that at higher redshift , double - peaked emitters still possess typical agn seds and x - ray spectra , and the double - peaked line profile can also be explained by the keplerian disk model .",
    "long - term profile variability has been found to be an ubiquitous property of double - peaked emitters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the field will continue to be surveyed in spectroscopic campaigns , it is likely that additional optical / near - ir spectroscopic data for j0331@xmath02755 can be obtained in the future .",
    "these will help to study line - profile variability and constrain better the structure and kinematics of the accretion disk , which could shed light on some of the unresolved problems discussed above .",
