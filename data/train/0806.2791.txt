    "bps type equations for gauge theories in higher dimensions were proposed long ago  @xcite as generalizations of the self - duality equations in four dimensions . for nonabelian gauge theory on a khler manifold",
    "the most natural bps condition lies in the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau equations  @xcite .",
    "these equations arise in compactifications of superstring theory down to four - dimensional minkowski spacetime as the condition for at least one unbroken supersymmetry . in this paper",
    "we will study the structure of solutions to these equations on product manifolds of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lie group @xmath0 and @xmath5 is a closed subgroup of @xmath13 .",
    "building on earlier work  @xcite , nonabelian gauge theory on the manifold @xmath14 , the product of a real @xmath15-dimensional manifold @xmath16 with lorentzian or riemannian nondegenerate metric and a two - sphere @xmath17 , was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18-equivariant dimensional reduction induces a yang - mills - higgs theory on @xmath16 which is a quiver gauge theory of rank one . for khler manifolds @xmath16 , with @xmath19 ,",
    "the proper reduction of the yang - mills equations on @xmath20 induces quiver gauge theory equations on @xmath21 , and quiver vortex equations on @xmath21 in the bps sector  @xcite .",
    "the seiberg - witten monopole equations  @xcite for @xmath22 and the ordinary vortex equations  @xcite for @xmath23 are particular instances of quiver vortex equations .",
    "it has also been shown that the ordinary vortex equations are integrable when @xmath24 is a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath25  @xcite . in that case @xmath26 is a gravitational instanton , and the vortex equations are the compatibility conditions of two linear equations ( lax pair ) so that the standard methods of integrable systems can be applied to the construction of their solutions . explicit @xmath18-equivariant monopole , dyon and monopole - antimonopole pair solutions of the yang - mills equations on @xmath26 were also obtained in  @xcite for @xmath24 of lorentzian signature @xmath27 and with the topology of @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "while the criteria for existence of solutions to all of these bps quiver vortex equations are by now well - understood  @xcite , in practice it is usually quite difficult to write down explicit solutions of them .",
    "the construction of exact solutions is facilitated when @xmath21 is the noncommutative space @xmath30 . in this instance",
    "both bps and non - bps solutions were obtained for various cases in  @xcite,@xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will extend these constructions by @xmath0-equivariant dimensional reduction over the coset spaces @xmath31 , where @xmath2 or @xmath3 . in the former case",
    "the coset space is the complex projective plane @xmath32 .",
    "we will find that many aspects of the induced rank two quiver gauge theory on @xmath21 in this case are qualitatively similar to that obtained from the symmetric space @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "however , the technical aspects are much more involved and some new features emerge from the nonabelian @xmath18 instanton degrees of freedom which now reside at the vertices of the quiver . in the latter case",
    "the coset space is the six - dimensional homogeneous manifold @xmath34 , and the qualitative features of the rank two quiver gauge theories are much different in this case , even though the quiver vertex degrees of freedom involve two @xmath35 monopole charges as in the @xmath33 case  @xcite .",
    "this space has appeared before in a variety of different physical contexts , such as in connection with the dynamics of m - theory on a manifold of g@xmath36 holonomy which develops a conical singularity  @xcite , and for the dimensional reduction of ten - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories over six - dimensional coset spaces in much the same spirit as our more general reductions  @xcite . in these latter applications",
    "the usage of the non - symmetric space @xmath34 induces a four - dimensional field theory with softly broken @xmath37 supersymmetry .",
    "we expect that our constructions will have direct applications in these classes of models , though this is left for future work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "throughout we present detailed constructions and examples of the pertinent quiver gauge theories .",
    "although most of our analyses are model dependent , our techniques and results apply to reductions over more general coset spaces @xmath38 , where @xmath13 is a compact lie group and @xmath5 is a closed subgroup of @xmath13 . in section  [ quiverreps ]",
    "we give explicit constructions of the quivers and their representations which will underlie the gauge theories considered in this paper . in section  [ quiverbuns ] we carry out the @xmath0-equivariant dimensional reductions and explicitly construct the fields of the quiver gauge theory .",
    "in section  [ ncinst ] we study the bps equations of the quiver gauge theory which describe nonabelian quiver vortices . in section  [ ncquivvort ]",
    "we construct explicit bps and non - bps solutions of finite energy on the noncommutative deformation of @xmath39 .",
    "finally , in section  [ dcharges ] we compute topological charges of our noncommutative instanton solutions from various points of view , and use the constructions to propose a novel interpretation of the configurations as states of d - branes .",
    "in this section we will give purely algebraic constructions of the quivers that will play a role throughout this paper , following the general formalism developed in  @xcite .",
    "they are based on the representation theory of the lie group @xmath40 , and are naturally associated to homogeneous vector bundles whose fibres transform under irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "we will begin with the simplest instance of the fundamental representation as illustration of the method",
    ". then we will give the general construction , and illustrate the formalism with various other explicit examples .",
    "we are interested in the geometry of coset spaces of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath5 is a closed subgroup of @xmath40 . given a finite - dimensional representation @xmath41 of @xmath5 , the corresponding induced , homogeneous hermitean vector bundle over @xmath38 is given by the fibred product = g_h  .",
