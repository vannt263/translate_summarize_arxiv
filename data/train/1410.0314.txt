    "cosmology and astrophysics are among the most successful probes for very weakly interacting particles within extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "indeed a substantial part of our knowledge also about the more weakly interacting standard model particles , the neutrinos , comes from cosmological and astrophysical data .",
    "particularly interesting is the case of the gravitino , the superpartner of the graviton in supergravity extensions of the standard model . for such particle",
    "the couplings are all set by the symmetry and can not be modified easily .",
    "it was therefore realized very early on , that gravitinos can be very dangerous long - lived relics in the early universe if they are not stable .",
    "this is often referred to as the _ gravitino problem _ in cosmology @xcite .",
    "of course the other possibility is for the gravitinos to be the lightest supersymmetric particle and in that case they can also successfully play the role of dark matter @xcite .",
    "we are here instead interested in a different scenario , where the gravitinos are ultra - light , with masses much smaller than the electroweak scale or even the other sm particle masses . in that case",
    "gravitinos can be in thermal equilibrium and survive as thermal relics , but they play practically no role in cosmology , since their energy density is negligible .",
    "an ultralight gravitino can be naturally obtained in supersymmetric models of the no - scale type and gives rise to a very interesting phenomenology thanks to its enhanced couplings @xcite , as we will review in sec .",
    "[ ss : gravitinolagrangian ] . in that case , thanks to the large interaction with normal matter , astrophysics provides the possibility to constrain the scenario",
    ". indeed astrophysical object like stars and supernovae are highly sensitive to any additional cooling mechanism , apart for neutrino emission , and have been exploited in the past to put limits on new particles , e.g. in the case of axions @xcite .    in the past various approaches to restrict an ultra - light gravitino through astrophysical observations",
    "have been made .",
    "some early constraints on its mass were derived from cosmology , more precisely from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "it was shown that bbn allows either a light gravitino @xmath0kev or a very heavy one @xcite .",
    "these investigations have been revisited in 1993 by moroi  @xcite and four years later again by gherghetta @xcite .",
    "other studies investigated the possibility of exotic cooling of stars , red giants and white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these limits were reviewed in @xcite , where it is shown that the limits depend as well on the masses of the scalar partners of the gravitino .",
    "our analysis is based on @xcite , wherein we revisited and generalized some of the results obtained by grifols , mohapatra and riotto during the 90s @xcite .",
    "they were able to exclude a gravitino mass range covering a few orders of magnitude in the ultra - light mass regime from the sn1987a observation .",
    "the exact mass interval however depends on the masses of the sgoldstinos , the scalar superpartner of the goldstino field , which are model - dependent . in the early works @xcite such fields",
    "were implicitly assumed to be massless .",
    "moreover most of these results were obtained assuming a specific relation between the sgoldstino s coupling parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the photino and gravitino mass , namely @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the masses of the gravitino and photino respectively .",
    "however this kind of relation does not have to occur in general models .",
    "we generalize here previous results by performing a full parameter scan in the model - dependent parameters such as the sgoldstino masses and couplings .",
    "moreover we consider also possible effects of r - parity breaking , that opens up the possibility of a single - gravitino production channel .",
    "a core collapse of stars with masses larger than a few solar masses can trigger a giant stellar explosion called a supernova .",
    "its dynamics can be explained by a `` bounce - and - shock '' model . at the end of the star evolution",
    "the iron core can no longer release energy via fusion and remains stable as long as the electron degeneracy pressure balances the gravitational pressure .",
    "however , once the core mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit of @xmath5 it becomes unstable and starts to collapse .",
    "shortly afterwards , the gravitational binding energy @xmath6 gets released .",
    "a large fraction of this energy is emitted in the form of neutrinos . in eq .",
    "@xmath7  km is the core radius .    on february 23th 1987 the blue giant sanduleak-69202 in",
    "the large magellanic cloud exploded in a supernova that was named sn1987a .",
    "it is the first , and so far the only supernova , for which the emitted neutrinos have been observed directly .",
    "they have been detected by kamiokande ii and imb @xcite .",
    "models of gravitational collapse @xcite allow to estimate the neutrino energy released by sn1987a as @xmath8 combining eqs .   and , one finds the upper limit @xmath9 on the luminosity @xmath10 which can be produced by anomalous cooling mechanisms present in sn1987a .",
    "many models for physics beyond the standard model predict new light weakly interacting particles which can in principle contribute to @xmath10 .    at this point",
    "we mention that constraints from anomalous sn cooling can also been found for other proposed light particles such as axions @xcite and sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "furthermore it is also possible to apply the energy loss argument to alternative astrophysical settings such as massive stars with @xmath11 solar masses , which has been done for axions in 2012 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on supernovae , since they reach a larger core temperature compared to stars and are therefore expected to give the strongest constraints .",
    "we compute in the following the contribution to @xmath10 generated by ultralight gravitinos production via photon collisions during a supernova of type ii and we apply the constrain given in eq .  .",
    "as derived in appendix a , the constraint is given as a function of the gravitino production cross - section as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the momenta of the incoming photons , @xmath14 has been approximated by @xmath15 and the factor @xmath16 comes from the two possible photon polarizations . compared to the one used previously in @xcite . ]",
    "the described argument applies only if the gravitinos produced at sn1987a escape the supernova core and carry away energy .",
    "if the gravitino - matter coupling is sufficiently strong , the gravitino mean - free - path @xmath17 could be short enough for the gravitinos to diffuse inside the supernova core . if the gravitinos are trapped inside the core radius @xmath18  km for longer than @xmath19  s , their energy is depleted by neutrino emission and the gravitino luminosity is again compatible with @xmath20 .",
    "trapped gravitinos random - walk through the core and cover a distance @xmath21 in a time interval @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of gravitino scatterings .",
    "hence , we obtain the lower bound for @xmath17 , @xmath24 the limit applies therefore for gravitino mean - free - paths larger than only . in this paper",

    "a massive gravitino obtains its @xmath41 helicity states by absorbing the goldstino field via the super - higgs mechanism  @xcite .",
    "if the gravitino mass is very small compared to the energy scale of the relevant processes , its @xmath41 helicity states dominate in the transition amplitudes ( with some exception discussed below ) , and the gravitino effectively behaves like a massless goldstino . in this case the gravitino @xmath42 helicity states are negligible in the calculations .",
    "this result is a consequence of the susy equivalence theorem @xcite . in the limit in which the equivalence theorem applies",
    ", we can approximate the gravitino field @xmath43 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spin-@xmath46 goldstino . the small @xmath39 term in the denominator of leads to an enhancement of the gravitino interactions . in certain models",
    "this enhancement of the gravitino interactions affects also the sgoldstinos , the scalar superpartners of the goldstino .",
    "in contrast to the goldstino , the sgoldstinos do not disappear from the physical spectrum .",
    "they can be very light , with masses of the order of the gravitino mass  @xcite , or also much heavier .",
    "indeed , light sgoldstino are generally very long - lived and can be problematic for cosmology , so that heavy sgoldstinos are favoured from that point of view . in general",
    "though , the scenario with an ultralight gravitino could not only allow observations of gravitational effects due to the gravitino , but also due to new particles from the hidden susy breaking sector .    in using eq .",
    ", we implicitly neglect terms suppressed by powers of @xmath39 higher than @xmath47 in the gravitino polarization tensor ( see eq .   below ) . in the case of processes with more than one external gravitino , and involving several diagrams exhibiting different dependencies on @xmath39 , these higher order terms are not negligible . rather than using the complete spin-@xmath48 polarization tensor @xmath49 , given e.g. in @xcite , it is convenient to expand @xmath49 in powers of @xmath39 , @xmath50 performing then a careful @xmath39 power counting in the relevant amplitudes , and identifying so the leading contributions to the observables . in eq .",
    ", we denote by @xmath51 the coefficient of the @xmath52 term in this power series expansion . with this notation",
    ", @xmath53 corresponds to the polarization tensor resulting from eq .  .",
    "as we have seen , the scalar partners of the goldstino remain as physical fields in the spectrum and they can be as light as the gravitino . we can write the general effective sgoldstino lagrangian as follows @xmath54 in eq .  , the scalar and pseudo - scalar fields , respectively @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are the real sgoldstino components  @xcite given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a scalar component of the @xmath59 chiral multiplet in the hidden sector , whose non - vanishing @xmath60-term breaks supersymmetry .",
    "the sgoldstino couplings constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 are model dependent , but can be related to other susy breaking parameters in specific scenarios as we will see below .",
    "they largely depend on the @xmath59-dependent contribution to the gauge kinetic function , on the khler potential and on the superpotential . also model - dependent are the sgoldstino masses . in fact ,",
    "even if the sgoldstino direction is univocally determined by the susy breaking direction in the scalar field space , the scalar mass matrix is often non - diagonal and the sgoldstinos in general mix with the other moduli fields , so that they are not in general eigenstates of the scalar mass matrix ( see e.g. @xcite for constraints arising from the scalar mass matrix in minkowski and de - sitter vacua ) .",
    "we will consider the lagrangian given above to include in an effective way the presence also of those additional scalars .",
    "indeed the presence of many scalar can be approximated by an appropriate increase of the gravitino - scalar couplings . in deriving limits on the gravitino mass",
    ", we assume the lagrangian ( [ eq : lsgoldstino ] ) , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the product of coupling constants @xmath63 , as free parameters .",
    "we now provide examples for how ( [ eq : lsgoldstino ] ) , and in particular @xmath39 , can be generated in specific models for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "though to specify the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking and mediation is not necessary in our model - independent study , it can allow to explicitly relate @xmath39 to the scale of supersymmetry breaking and then to the rest of the supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "the mechanism responsible for supersymmetry breaking is yet unknown , but we can consider two general classes of models , depending if the breaking is mainly due to the superpotential , @xmath60-term breaking , or the gauge sector , i.e. @xmath64-term breaking",
    ". we will here shortly review the prediction for the mass spectrum and sgoldstino couplings in the first case . in the case of @xmath64-term",
    "breaking of supersymmetry , in order to obtain a vanishing cosmological constant , also a non - vanishing superpotential @xmath65 and therefore @xmath60-terms are present at the minimum , leading to a combined @xmath64-term and @xmath60-term breaking , where often the @xmath60-term dominates  @xcite . if supersymmetry is broken by non - vanishing @xmath60-terms for some of the chiral multiplets , the goldstino field is the corresponding combination of the fermionic partners , i.e. @xmath66 . very often one approximates this picture by assuming that one single chiral multiplet breaks supersymmetry and then the goldstino is simply @xmath67 .",
    "a simple computable model of this type is the polonyi model @xcite , based on a chiral multiplet @xmath59 in the hidden sector with canonical khler potential and the superpotential @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the scale of susy - breaking , since the @xmath70 f - term is @xmath71 , and the constant @xmath72 is chosen to ensure zero vacuum energy at the potential minimum . in this simple case",
    "the sgoldstinos are just the scalar and pseudoscalar components of the @xmath59 superfield as given above and their masses are of the order of the gravitino mass : @xmath73 in this scenario all the moduli fields of the theory gain similar masses via gravity mediation , giving rise to a multidimensional non - diagonal scalar field mass matrix .",
    "the goldstino direction is in general not an eigenstate of such a matrix and therefore non - trivial mixings can arise in the scalar sector .",
    "also the gauginos obtain a mass via gravity mediation of a similar order , if the gauge kinetic function has a dependence on @xmath59 .",
    "for an ultralight gravitino such a light mass spectrum is long excluded by collider bounds on the mass of the sm superpartners .    another popular mechanism of mediation , providing a large",
    "mass splitting between the sm superpartners and the gravitino , is gauge mediation @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can be easily embedded in the model  ( [ eq : polonyi ] ) just by adding a coupling of the polonyi field to sm charged messengers as @xmath74 with @xmath75  @xcite",
    ". then the gaugino and scalar masses are generated at one and two - loop level respectively and read @xmath76 where @xmath77 are sm representation dependent constants  @xcite .",
    "we see then that the ratio between the gravitino and the photino mass is given by @xmath78 note that in the simplest model , barring cancellations , the mass of the messengers is also given by the vacuum expectation value of @xmath55 by the term @xmath79 , giving again masses of similar order . assuming though the presence of more fields @xmath70",
    ", it is possible to disentangle the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field and the f - term and obtain also very different ratios of masses .",
    "we see that to have a large mass splitting allowing for an ultralight gravitino we are therefore obliged to consider more complicated hidden sectors and many very light messengers , just around the electroweak scale .    regarding the couplings between the sgoldstinos and the qed gauge multiplet , they arise in gauge mediation via a similar one - loop diagram to that generating the gaugino masses , just substituting the f - term insertion with a physical scalar field .",
    "we therefore expect in the simplest case that the coupling @xmath1 is given by @xmath80 but in the more general case cancellations between diagrams or the presence of scalar mixing parameters can give rise to smaller values of the couplings .",
    "note that in gravity mediation the same coupling is instead @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the couplings @xmath2 between the gravitino and the sgoldstinos are a remnant of the usual supergravity coupling between the gravitino , a scalar field and its superpartners for the goldstino multiplet . in the limit of light gravitino and single goldstino field ,",
    "the dominant coupling is then of the form given above with @xmath82 while in the case of many scalar moduli the coupling can be reduced by mixing matrices .",
    "so we obtain for the relevant product of coupling , which will later appear in the cross - sections , @xmath83    we will take this value as the maximal possible value in the following and consider later also the simplified expression obtained for @xmath84 gev , i.e. @xmath85 in order to compare with previous works  @xcite .",
    "note that in this case the product of couplings is not an independent parameter , but it is determined by the gravitino mass . in the general case , instead , since the scale of @xmath86 is arbitrary , @xmath87 is an independent parameter .      in the model discussed above ,",
    "a single scale , namely @xmath88 , determines the gravitino mass via @xmath89 , and the masses of the remaining superpartners through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m0m12 ] ) . in the light of existing limits on gaugino and sfermion masses",
    ", it can hence be difficult to accommodate an ultra - light gravitino within this model , even if it is possible when a very large number of messenger fields @xmath23 is considered .",
    "models where gaugino and sfermion masses are to some extent independent of the gravitino mass are of great interest for our analysis , since in that case ultra - light gravitinos can exist avoiding constraints from lhc and direct searches for new physics . within the many possibilities , we mention here a few examples of this type .    a family of models where ultra - light gravitinos , and tev gauginos and sfermions can coexist is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the theory assumes a no - scale form for the khler function , and a diagonal non - canonical gauge kinetic function @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constants , and @xmath55 is the hidden sector field responsible for supersymmetry breaking . in this case",
    "the gaugino and gravitino masses are related as follows @xmath93 and properly choosing @xmath92 , @xmath39 can be ultra - light and @xmath94 at the tev scale .",
    "another way to disentangle the gaugino and gravitino masses and allow for low scale of susy breaking is also to consider dirac mass terms for the gauginos @xcite .",
    "in particular just taking simply a dirac gluino can relax strongly the lhc bounds on the neutralino sector , allowing for low majorana neutralino masses , by avoiding universality between gauginos without enhancing effects from the rges  @xcite .    within extra - dimensional models ,",
    "even more possibilities arise . on one hand , many very light ( pseudo)goldstino states could remain physical and play a similar role to the gravitino @xcite and on the other the connections between superpartner masses become more involved .",
    "a very interesting class of models was proposed recently in  @xcite and has the gravitino as a bulk field in a @xmath95-dimensional theory .",
    "the remaining particles in the mssm mass spectrum are localized on a 4-dimensional brane .",
    "supersymmetry breaking occurs in a @xmath96-brane , with @xmath97 , via an @xmath60-term denoted here by @xmath98 .",
    "after supersymmetry breaking , the mssm particles acquire masses of the order of @xmath99  tev , where @xmath35 is the size of the extra - dimensions .",
    "the gravitino kk tower instead starts at @xmath100 which can be arbitrarily small , properly choosing @xmath98 , @xmath2 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , where @xmath102 is the fundamental gravitational scale .",
    "notably , decays of the lightest particle in the mssm mass spectrum into slightly lighter kk gravitinos are favored in this model . from the lhc perspective",
