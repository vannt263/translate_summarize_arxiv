    "most ob stars show line profile variability ( lpv ) .",
    "the active investigation of this phenomenon started about 40 years ago .",
    "the lpv was found in x - ray , uv and the optical region of spectrum .",
    "it turned out that variability can be regular , cyclic and stochastic and all types of variability can present at the same time . the stochastic lpv is connected with the formation of small - scale structures in the stellar wind .",
    "the regular and cyclic lpv can be induced by the large - scale structures in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the presence of these structures is stimulated by wind instabilities , nrp , local inhomogeneities and the presence of global dipolar or small - scale local magnetic fields .",
    "if the amplitude of the variations is large compared to the noise contribution and the data are well sampled in time , it is easy to detect the lpv by overplotting individual or residual ( individual profile minus the average profile ) profiles of a line or by plotting the dynamical lpv spectrum .",
    "the commonly accepted method of detecting the relatively weak lpv is temporal variance spectrum analysis introduced by  @xcite .",
    "this method can be used when the observations were obtained for both regular and irregular time grids . in this method the standard deviations of lpvs for both lines and continuum are compared .",
    "if the amplitude of deviations within a line is clearly larger than in the continuum then detection at a selected significance level can be claimed .",
    "if the observed standard deviations for lpvs are smaller than expected for the noise contribution then only the upper limit of the lpv amplitude can be estimated .    in the following years",
    "the tvs was frequently used to study lpvs .",
    "@xcite used the tvs to investigate the long - term variations in the h@xmath0 line profiles in spectra of 6 ba supergiants .",
    "the method of tvs was used by @xcite to analyse the spectral variability of o9.5ia supergiant @xmath1cam .",
    "@xcite employed the tvs analysis to study the lpv for h@xmath0 line profiles .",
    "they modified the method to take into account the effects of wind emission .",
    "in many cases tvs analysis detects the weak lpv .",
    "for example , @xcite found variability of ovi @xmath2  lines in spectra of wr7a star using tvs though the ovi lines central depth does not exceed the noise level ( see their fig .",
    "@xcite have investigated the tvs spectra for wr 48c star wx cen .",
    "they found a highly variable component in the tvs of highly ionized ion ovi @xmath2  lines .",
    "this component was also seen in the tvs red wings of h@xmath3 and heii@xmath4 .",
    "the nature of the component remains unknown .",
    "recently @xcite have analysed the strong variability of the emission line profiles in spectra of the close binary supersoft x - ray source v  sge , which is considered as a candidate to sn ia progenitor , with tvs technique .",
    "the tvs for the strongest spectral lines were constructed using their 110 spectra obtained in 2010 and 2012 .",
    "they detected only marginal lpv of the bowen ciii / niii complex ( @xmath5 ) and strong variations for lines heii @xmath6  and h@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite have presented the results of a time series analysis of 130 chelle spectra of @xmath7 ori ( b0ia ) , acquired over seven observing seasons between 1998 and 2006 at ritter observatory .",
    "tvs revealed significant wind variability in both h@xmath0 and hei @xmath8 lines .",
    "the hei line tvs has a double - peaked profile consistent with radial velocity oscillations . in the recent paper by @xcite",
    "the variability of twelve spectral lines was investigated by means of the tvs for seven o9b0.5 stars .",
    "the selected lines probe the radial structure of the atmosphere from the photosphere to the outer wind .",
    "the variability of h and hei  ii lines was detected .",
    "if the amplitude of lpv is sufficiently high the value of tvs within the corresponding line substantially exceeds its value in the adjacent continuum . in many cases the lpv are extremely weak , not more than 1% of the continuum level for many of o stars .",
    "to detect such variability the smoothed temporal variance spectrum method proposed by  @xcite can be used .",
    "the detection of extremely weak lpv gives an opportunity to explore the stratification in the stellar atmosphere , so the detection of such micro lpv seems to be very important .",
    "we also show that the tvs ( or smtvs ) method can be used not only for looking for lpv .",
    "one of the important problems in the study of non - radial pulsations of stars is determination of pulsation modes @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for this purpose different methods",
    "were developed , for example  @xcite .",
    "the most convenient of these methods is the analysis of changes of the pulsation phase component between blue and red wings of the line profile  @xcite .",
    "these methods require a large number of observations covering several periods of pulsations .",
    "it is not always possible to carry out such observations because this would require a large number of spectra with a high signal - to - noise ratio for each star .",
    "quite often collected spectra comprise only a fraction of the stellar pulsation period or the spectra are obtained at time intervals separated by large gaps . in this case",
    "using of the equations for calculation @xmath9 and @xmath10 from  @xcite is impossible .",
    "however , applying tvs or smtvs is still possible .",
    "the influence of pulsational velocity fields on photospheric line profiles was shown by @xcite .",
    "the purely radial mode produces the double - peaked tvs . when there is a mode with a large horizontal component present , the peak separation of the tvs becomes smaller compared to a purely radial mode .",
    "a mode with smaller horizontal velocity field produces tvs with one peak .",
    "the authors note that the shape of tvs depends on the time sampling so tvs obtained during different runs will not in general look the same .    in the present paper",
    "we describe how the tvs and smtvs method can be applied for detection of extremely small amplitude lpv in spectra of ob stars .",
