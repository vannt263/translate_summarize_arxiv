    "for a long time quantum field theories formulated in a groenewold - moyal deformed ( or @xmath2-deformed ) space  @xcite suffered from new types of divergences arising due to a phenomenon referred to as uv / ir mixing  @xcite . for a review on the topic see refs .",
    "only some years ago , grosse and wulkenhaar were able to resolve the uv / ir mixing problem in the case of a scalar field theory by adding an oscillator - like term to the ( euclidean ) action  @xcite , thereby rendering it renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "eventually , an alternative approach was put forward by gurau et al .",
    "@xcite by replacing the oscillator term with one of type @xmath3 .",
    "the authors were able to prove renormalizability of this `` @xmath4-model '' to all orders by means of multiscale analysis .",

    "@xcite , seems to be a very promising candidate for a renormalizable @xmath0 gauge theory on @xmath2-deformed space .    in the present work",
    "i generalize this model to the @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "it is formulated on euclidean @xmath5 with the moyal - deformed product @xmath6 } \\equiv   x_{\\mu } \\star x_{\\nu } -x_{\\nu } \\star x_{\\mu } = { \\mathrm{i}}{\\varepsilon}{\\theta}_{\\mu \\nu}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of regular commuting coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "the real parameter @xmath8 has mass dimension @xmath9 , rendering the constant antisymmetric matrix @xmath10 dimensionless .    in the following",
    "i will use the abbreviations @xmath11 for vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 for matrices @xmath14 . for the deformation",
    ", i furthermore consider the simplest block - diagonal form @xmath15 for the dimensionless matrix describing non - commutativity .",
    "the main ideas that in a series of papers  @xcite led to the construction of a model for @xmath0 gauge fields  @xcite , which has a good chance of being fully renormalizable , are :    * to implement a damping mechanism similar to the one present in the scalar @xmath4-model of gurau et al .",
    "@xcite , * to endow the tree level action with counter terms for the quadratic and linear one - loop infrared divergent terms of type  @xcite : @xmath16 and @xmath17 * and to keep the model as simple as possible .",
    "the greatest difficulty in the early approaches turned out to be the implementation of the ir damping : in ref .",
    "@xcite an additional gauge invariant term was added to the action which ultimately led to an infinite number of vertices .",
    "localization of that term through the introduction of auxiliary fields could remedy the situation with respect to the tree level vertices .",
    "however , other problems concerning renormalizability due to additional new feynman rules for the auxiliary fields , remained  cf .",
    "therefore , an alternative approach was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the required extension to the @xmath0 gauge field action was implemented by means of a `` soft breaking '' technique similar to the gribov - zwanziger action in qcd  see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .    here",
    "i will follow the same ideas .",
    "furthermore , it must also be taken into account , that in non - commutative @xmath1 gauge field models only the @xmath0 subsector is responsible for uv / ir mixing ( cf .",
    "this means , that infrared divergent terms only appear in feynman graphs which have at least one external leg in the @xmath0 subsector .",
    "the key point here is that , by employing the soft breaking mechanism , one only modifies the infrared regime of the model while keeping the uv intact",
    ". both uv divergences , on the one hand , as well as ir terms originating from uv / ir mixing in e.g. one - loop corrections , on the other hand , are caused by the uv regime of the integrand in a feynman loop graph  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the same one - loop results to leading order are expected for the current model as in the literature  @xcite ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : one - loop ] below and in ref .",

    "( [ eq : prop_aa_limits ] ) one can nicely see the appearance of a term of the same type as in the ir limit .",
    "this , by construction , admits the absorption of the problematic divergent terms appearing in the one loop results  @xcite .",
    "another advantageous property of the gauge propagator is that the uv limit ( from which divergences originate ) , admits to neglect the term proportional to @xmath52 which reduces the number of terms in feynman integrals considerably , especially since both @xmath0 and @xmath18 propagators are of the same form in this limit .",
    "the ghost propagator takes the usual simple form @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath81 does not couple to the auxiliary fields ( @xmath82 ) no other propagator will contribute to physical results , and they are hence omitted at this point .    additionally , the model features several vertices . similar to , one may consider their uv approximations , which for the purpose of one - loop calculations would be sufficient . within this approximation",
    "the vertices are given by the same expressions as in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in other words , terms proportional to @xmath53 in the @xmath83 vertex may be omitted as they are negligible for large momenta and hence play no role in the one - loop divergences . in the infrared , they scale as , but such linear ir divergent terms are always compensated by quadratically ir damping gauge field propagators  cp .",
    "( [ eq : prop_aa_limits ] ) .    considering the scaling behaviour of all these feynman rules for large momenta ,",
    "one derives an estimate for the superficial degree of ultraviolet divergences , which is the well - known result @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the number of external legs of the various field types in a feynman graph .    when extracting the resulting uv divergences of the various one - loop corrections , only those terms in the feynman rules contribute which survive the uv approximations discussed above .",
    "hence , these computations reduce to exactly the same ones already done in the literature , i.e. see  @xcite . the vacuum polarization hence exhibits a logarithmic uv divergence of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "in addition , as discussed in the literature , there is also a uv finite contribution to the vacuum polarization which diverges quadratically for vanishing external momentum .",
    "it is of type and appears _ only _ in graphs where the external legs are in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "in fact , this can be easily seen by considering the according phase factors when the free colour indices @xmath88 . in that case , one has phase factors of the form @xmath89 since @xmath90 . clearly , they are phase - independent and hence lead to purely planar contributions .    the @xmath83-vertex corrections exhibit uv divergences of the form  @xcite @xmath91 as well as finite contributions . the latter exhibit ir divergences in the external momenta of type only if at least one external leg is in the @xmath0 subsector , as emphasized above  @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can argue that infrared divergent terms appear also in @xmath92-point graphs _ only _ if at least one of the external legs is in the @xmath0 subsector by considering , for example , graphical representations of non - planar feynman diagrams using the t hooft double index notation  @xcite .",
    "what one finds , is that it is impossible to construct a non - planar graph without having at least one external @xmath0 leg , and since uv / ir mixing occurs only in non - planar graphs  @xcite , as is well - known , the same is true for the appearance of ir terms .",
    "a renormalizable action must be form - invariant under quantum corrections , and its parameters are fixed by renormalization conditions on the vertex functions .",
    "so far , we have worked in landau gauge with @xmath93 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : prop_aa ] ) ) . however , for the following considerations , where we follow the steps of ref .",
    "@xcite , an arbitrary gauge parameter @xmath94 will be more advantageous , as the inverse of the gauge field propagator diverges in the limit @xmath95 due to elimitaion of the multiplier field @xmath42 .",
    "recall that the tree - level gauge field propagator ( using a compact and intuitive notation ) has the form @xmath96 where we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath97 i.e. terms including parameters @xmath98 or @xmath52 only appear in the @xmath99-propagator .",
    "its inverse , the tree - level two - point vertex function , is given by @xmath100 as discussed in section  [ sec : one - loop ] , its ( divergent ) one - loop corrections are qualitatively given by @xmath101 where @xmath87 is an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "hence , we find that in introducing the wave - function renormalization @xmath102 and the renormalized parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 according to @xmath105 the one - loop two - point vertex function can be cast into the same form as its tree - level counter part , i.e. @xmath106 perhaps the most important result of this calculation is that the wave - function renormalization @xmath102 is exactly the same for the @xmath0 and the @xmath18 gauge field because it is independent of @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , the quadratic ir divergence @xmath107 only enters the renormalization of the newly introduced parameter @xmath98 . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we note that the renormalized propagator takes the same form as apart from an additional prefactor @xmath108 , but with all parameters replaced by their renormalized counter parts .",
    "we also need to provide renormalization conditions for the two - point vertex function for the gauge boson @xmath109 where the vertex function has been split into a transversal and longitudinal part following ref .",
    "we have used the identifications @xmath110 which finally allow to formulate the following renormalization conditions : @xmath111      as usual , the @xmath112-function is given by the logarithmic derivative of the bare coupling @xmath113 with respect to the cut - off for fixed @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath115 the renormalized coupling is obtained from the relation @xmath116 , where @xmath117 denotes the multiplicative uv correction to the three - gluon vertex , and @xmath102 is the wave function renormalization introduced in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : renormalized_parameters ] ) .",
    "note that the wave function renormalization @xmath102 enters @xmath114 since the vertex correction was computed with the unrenormalized fields @xmath81 , which hence need to be replaced by their renormalized counter parts @xmath118 .",
    "one eventually obtains @xmath119 , i.e. a @xmath120-function with negative sign  @xcite which indicates asymptotic freedom and the absence of a landau ghost .",
    "finally , the linear ir divergence in the 3-gluon vertex correction , which qualitatively results to @xmath121 times the expression , leads to a renormalized parameter @xmath122 hence , it is absorbed by the according counter term .",
    "in this paper , the non - commutative @xmath1 gauge field action has been proposed as a generalization of the previously put forward @xmath0 counter part of ref .  @xcite . at least at one - loop level ,",
    "all dangerous ir divergent terms can be absorbed into according counter terms , and one may hope that this is true also for higher loop orders . furthermore , the wave - function renormalization @xmath102 is exactly the same for the @xmath0 and the @xmath18 gauge fields , which is crucial if the present model is to be taken seriously as a candidate for a renormalizable non - commutative @xmath1 gauge field model . in a next step towards a general proof of renormalizability ,",
