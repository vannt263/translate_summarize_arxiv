    "@xcite has been analyzed extensively .",
    "depending on the geometry and the double - layer thickness , walls can either reduce or enhance the translational velocity , and the rotational velocity can be opposite to the rolling typical of sedimention near a wall .",

    "[ ptb ]    wall_insulator.eps    as shown in figure  [ fig : wall ] , it is easy to see that the quadrupolar iceo flow around a polarizable particle typically causes attraction to unscreened conducting walls ( perpendicular to the field ) and repulsion from insulating walls ( parallel to the field ) .",
    "the former effect of icep attraction to conducting walls has not yet been analyzed ; it may play a role in colloidal self assembly on electrodes applying ac voltages  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is mainly understood in terms of electrohydrodynamic flows ( what we would term iceo ) induced on the electrodes , not the particles ( typically latex spheres ) , but icep could be important for more polarizable particles .",

    "as @xmath83 the imaginary parts of the solutions go to zero , and we are left with @xmath84 which is the standard smoluchowski s formula with a factor of @xmath85 .",
    "we have solved the equations using the finite element software comsol for various geometries which have been approximated by the cylindrical or spherical colloidal particle being enclosed by a finite rectangle .",

    "the fluid slip can be averaged and the stokes problem is solved only once using this averaged slip .    for reasons of completeness and easy reference , here we list the weak forms of the equations solved .",
    "this system of equations are converted to weak form by multiplying by corresponding test functions and integrating over the spatial domain .",

    "for isotropic particles near a wall , by symmetry , @xmath94 therefore @xmath95 . moreover , there is no net horizontal force exerted on the particle , so the only forces of interest is in the vertical direction .",
    "another consequence of symmetry is the absence of net torque on the cylinder .",
    "the dc cylinder problem has been solved analytically by zhao and bau @xcite in the linear case in bipolar coordinates .",

    "we are going to use this solution to gain some confidence in our numerical simulations . in fig.[valid1 ] , you can see the comparison of comsol results with the analytical expression .",
    "the match is especially good when the particle is close to the wall .",
    "it gets worse as this distance increases , because the effects from the other walls also kick in .",
    "the simulation in fig.[valid1 ] has run with a box of size 20x20 , and maximum mesh size 1 , with finer mesh on the particle , specifically a maximum size of 0.1 .",
    "experimentation with comsol shows that the hydrodynamic error is sensitive to the size of the box , while the error in the electrostatic force is more sensitive to the mesh size . for a larger box , 40x40 , and twice as finer mesh ,",
    "we have obtained a similar picture with errors cut to about one third of their values in fig.[valid1 ] ( results not shown ) .    [ ptb ]    valid1.eps      as the electric fields are screened quickly by the electrolyte , an ac field is usually preferred .",
    "use of an ac electric field also prevents harmful reactions on electrodes , and enables experimentalists to go to higher applied voltage differences .",
    "such higher voltages may be desirable if they lead to stronger electrokinetic effects of interest .",

    "iceo flow around a sphere was first considered by gamayunov et al .",
    "@xcite . following the cylinder analysis of squires and bazant  @xcite , it is straightforward to derive the ( dimensionless ) iceo slip velocity around an ideally polarizable sphere in an ac field , far from the wall , @xmath109 note that since @xmath110 the iceo flow in a constant dc field @xmath76 is twice as large as the time - averaged flow in an ac field @xmath111 of the same amplitude : @xmath112 .    for a sphere near a wall ,",
    "the results are qualitatively the same as for a cylinder near a wall .",
    "that is , in the dc case , both the hydrodynamic and the electrostatic forces are repulsive .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of hydrodynamic forces are about 2 orders of magnitude larger than the electrical forces .",
    "[ ptb ]    fullsphere1.eps    note that the steady and time - periodic plots are consistent : at @xmath113 the steady plots show forces about @xmath114 and @xmath115 the time - periodic plots , at the low frequency limit , start off at values @xmath116 and @xmath117 which are half of their steady counterparts .",
    "[ ptb ]    omsphere1.eps    unlike the cylinder problem , however , the electrostatic forces always remain repulsive , and therefore there is no equilibrium plane for the spherical particle , instead , it is repelled to infinity by the wall regardless of the forcing frequency .",
    "without a nearby wall , a janus sphere would align itself perpendicular to the electric field , that is , some of the electric field lines would be included in the plane dividing the janus particles metal and insulating sides .",
    "this effect has been demonstrated in @xcite , and is presumably stronger than the wall effects , at least when the particle is sufficiently away from the wall .",
    "that being said , we will assume that the particle always stays in the described configuration , that is , its dividing plane aligned with the electric field .",
    "this is not to say that the particle has no room for different rotational configurations , it can still rotate around @xmath66 and @xmath63 axis .",
    "rotations about the @xmath118 axis ( if existed ) leave the particle unchanged , so we are left with rotations only around the @xmath43 axis .",
    "this is much easier to deal with than the original problem though , as only one angle is enough the describe the particles orientation .",
    "far from the wall , the bulk velocity perpendicular to a dc field in the stable orientation is given by the formula of squires and bazant  @xcite ( eq .",
    "3.16 ) , which takes the dimensionless form , @xmath119 neglecting compact - layer surface capacitance .",
    "as noted above , the time - averaged velocity in a sinusoidal ac field is smaller by a factor of two in the limit of zero frequency . even in the bulk , without a wall , it is difficult to solve analytically for the iceo flow at finite ac frequency around a janus particle , since the electrical response is not simply an induced dipole , due to the broken symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the frequency dependence of the flow is similar to that around a sphere ( [ eq : acsphere ] ) , constant below the rc charging time and decaying above it .    for a janus sphere aligned perpendicular to the electric field near a wall",
    ", a crucial observation is that the @xmath118symmetry breaks down . as a result",
    ", there is a net force in the @xmath118direction , as well as a net torque in @xmath43direction .",
    "the former leads to translation parallel to the wall , while the latter causes rotation of the dielectric face toward the wall .",
    "we shall see that these effects of broken symmetry completely change the behavior near wall in an ac or dc field : although a polarizable sphere is always repelled to infinity by an insulating wall , a janus particle is always ( eventually ) attracted to it .      [ ptb ]    janus_tilt_wall_3.eps    the key new effect is rotation due to hydrodynamic torque caused by asymmetric iceo flow near the wall .",
    "this generally causes the janus particle to be attracted to the wall , as shown in figure  [ fig : tilt ] .",
    "the physical mechanism can be understood as follows . when the field is first turned on",
    ", the janus particle quickly rotates , by icep and dep , to align its metal / insulator interface with the field axis , but with an arbitrary azimuthal angle , mainly set by the initial condition .",
    "as described by squires and bazant  @xcite , the iceo flow around the particle draws in fluid along the field axis and ejects it radially at the equator  but only on the polarizable hemisphere , which acts like a jet engine  drives icep motion in the direction of the non - polarizable hemisphere , which leads the way like a nose .",
    "near a wall , as shown in the figure , the outward iceo flow pushes down on the wall harder on the side of the polarizable `` engine '' than on that of the non - polarizable `` nose '' , which produces a hydrodynamic torque tilting the nose toward the wall .",
    "a second cause of this rotation is the hydrodynamic coupling between icep translation parallel to the wall and rotation by shear stresses to cause rolling past the wall .",
    "regardless of the initial position , these two sources of icep rotation cause the nose to eventually face the wall , so that the translational engine drives it toward the wall .",
    "this is likely the origin of the counter - intuitive attraction of janus particles to a glass wall in the experiments of gangwal et al  @xcite .",
    "what happens next depends on the details of the particle - wall interaction at very close distances .",
    "we will see that the bulk model with thin double layers must eventually break down , since the particle eventually collides with the wall , leading to overlapping particle and wall double layers .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to accurately treat the nonlinear and time - dependent behavior of these overlapping double layers , so we will explore two models : ( i ) infinitely thin double layers , i.e. using the bulk model to arbitrarily small heights , and ( ii ) a cutoff collision  height , where overlapping double layers stop any further motion toward the wall , while still allowing transverse motion .",
    "the latter case assumes , as in the experiments  @xcite , that the particles and walls have _  equilibrium _ surface charge of the same sign . for concreteness",

    "based on the simple examples above , we expect a subtle dependence on the ac frequency .",
    "electrostatic dep motion will always begin to dominate the hydrodynamic icep motion at high frequency .",

    "the magnitude of the horizontal icep velocity @xmath123 parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the field is close to its bulk value @xmath124 even fairly close to the wall at a height @xmath125 at zero tilt , but reduces with the tilt angle . for small tilt angles and close to the wall at @xmath126 , the horizontal velocity increases to @xmath127 , but it drops below the bulk value at larger tilt angles , e.g. to @xmath128 at @xmath129 degrees . below",

    "although @xmath144 is measured in the low - frequency plateau @xmath145 , this behavior otherwise seems quite consistent , since the slower icep velocity can also fit the experimental data using smaller ( and perhaps more reasonable ) values of @xmath146 . for example",
    ", the predicted velocity of @xmath147 at @xmath134 implies @xmath148 , while the velocity @xmath149 at @xmath136 implies @xmath150 .    the difficulty in predicting the stable tilt angle at low frequency may be due to our use of the low - voltage , dilute - solution theory , which generally overpredicts the magnitude of iceo flows , especially with increasing salt concentration .",
    "for example , the electrophoretic mobility can saturate at large induced voltages , and the charging dynamics can also be altered significantly when crowding effects are taken into account  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "our simulation results at moderate frequencies @xmath151 , which exhibit reduced iceo flow due to incomplete double - layer charging , may ressemble the predictions of more accurate large - voltage , concentrated - solution theories at low frequency @xmath152 , where flow is reduced instead by ion crowding in the double layer .",
    "this will be the subject of future work .",
    "another source of error in the model is our inaccurate treatment of the contact region , where double - layers overlap .",
    "we have simply imposed a small cutoff height in model ( ii ) to prevent the wall collision , but there may be more complicated mechanical effects of the contact region .",
    "in particular , there may be enhanced hydrodynamic slip , due to the repulsion of overlapping ( equilibrium ) double layers of the same sign , as in the experiments .",
    "[ ptb ]    torques.eps    [ ptb ]    forcesy.eps    by examining the forces and torques close to the wall , we can infer to some degree what mechanical properties of the contact region might lead to the observed icep sliding along the wall and smaller tilt angles at lower frequencies ( and thus also somewhat larger velocities ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : janus_torque ] , before the particle gets very close to the wall , the ( mostly hydrodynamic ) torque acts to completely tilt the non - polarizable face toward the wall leading to collision . as noted above in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] , this can be understood as a result of the downward component of iceo flow on the polarizable hemisphere raising the pressure by pushing on the wall on that side .",
    "the situation changes when the particle gets very close to the wall . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : janus_torque ] , the torque changes sign at a tilt angle which is roughly @xmath153 .",
    "this again can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] , since the iceo flow between the particle and the wall on the polarizable side , which drives the torque , is mostly absent .",
    "it would thus seem that even in a dc field , the particle would not rotate any farther , but this thinking neglects the hydrodynamic coupling between translational force and rotational velocity near the wall , eq .",
    "( [ eq : force - slip ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : janus_force ] , we see that the force on the particle parallel to the wall @xmath154 remains strong , and this leads to a rolling effect over the wall due to shear stresses . for this reason , the rotational velocity persists in fig .",
    "[ fig : janus_dc ] even when the torque goes to zero in fig .",
    "[ fig : janus_torque ] .",
    "the model assumes no slip on all non - polarizable surfaces , but this may not be a good approximation near the contact point when double layers overlap . if the equilibrium surface charges ( or zeta potentials ) on the non - polarizable hemisphere and the wall have opposite signs , then the overlapping double layers lead to a strong attraction , which would only stiffen the effective contact with the surface , and thus only increase the viscous rolling effect during motion along the surface .",
    "if the equilibrium surface charges ( or zeta potentials ) have the same sign , however , as in the experiments on gold - coated latex janus particles near glass walls  @xcite , then there is a strong repulsion at the contact point .",
    "this repulsion stops the collision with the wall in model ( ii ) , but it may also lubricate  the contact and allow for some sliding .",
    "this effective slip over the wall near the contact point could reduce the viscous rolling , and , in the absence of torque , cause the rotation to stop , or at least be reduced for tile angles above @xmath153 . in that case",
    ", we might expect a more accurate model of the contact region to predict to the experimentally observed motion , sliding over the surface by icep with a small tilt angle ( @xmath155 ) , for a wider range of conditions , including lower ac frequency , perhaps even in the dc limit .",
    "we have use the existing low - voltage theory of icep to predict the motion of polarizable particles near an insulating wall .",
    "our results for symmetric spheres and cylinders confirm the expected repulsion from the wall due to iceo flow , sketched in figure 1(a ) . in the case of the cylinder",
    "we show that attraction is also possible at high frequency , where dep from electrostatic forces dominates slip - driven icep motion .",
    "our results for asymmetric janus particles reveal an unexpected attraction to the wall by a novel mechanism illustrated in figure  [ fig : tilt ] , which involves tilting of the less polarizable face toward the wall .",
    "once it reaches the wall , if double - layer repulsion prevents further collision , the particle either rotates completely and ceases to move , while driving steady iceo flow , or reaches an equilibrium tilt angle around 45@xmath133 while steadily translating along the surface , perpendicular to the elecric field .",
    "the latter motion only arises at moderate frequencies in our model , above the characteristic charging frequency for the double layers , while in experiments it is also observed at low frequencies .",
    "more accurate models taking into account reduced iceo flow at large voltage in non - dilute solutions and more accurate models of the contact region may improve the agreement with experiments .    in any case",
    ", we have shown that polarizable particles can display complex interactions with walls due to broken symmetries in iceo flows .",
    "attractive and repulsive interactions can be tuned by varying the geometry of the particles ( and the walls ) , as well as the ac frequency and voltage .",
