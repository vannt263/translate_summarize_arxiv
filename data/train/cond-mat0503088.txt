    "for a metallic island small enough to give large charging energy exceeding the temperature , quantum transport through it shows remarkable features due to strongly correlated electrons . a single - electron transistor ( set )",
    "is popular geometry of studying transport through the metallic island , in which the island is coupled to two large reservoirs ( source and drain ) via tunneling junctions and to another reservoir capacitively ( gate).@xcite the most important principle of operating set is the coulomb - blockade effects in the island . in an usual situation particles can not tunnel into the island due to the coulomb energy .",
    "however , when the coulomb energy is reduced by a gate bias , transport through the island is possible even with a small bias between the source and drain .",
    "consequently , tunneling currents show a series of peaks , called the coulomb - blockade peaks , as a function of gate voltage .    from fundamental and applied point of views , the shape of coulomb - blockade peaks",
    "has been attracted much attention and widely studied in static bias conditions.@xcite the appearance of the coulomb - blockade peaks depends on two conditions .",
    "the first is much larger charging energy than the temperature to blockade thermal excitation .",
    "the second is thick tunneling barriers guaranteeing a large dwelling time for electrons to resolve the charging energy in the island .",
    "then , from the energy uncertainty principle , the latter is approximately fulfilled under the condition that parallel resistance @xmath0 of the barriers is much larger than the resistance quantum @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "it is now well known that for large tunneling resistance @xmath0 , transport in a set is achieved by the sequences of uncorrelated tunneling processes and the smearing of peaks is dominated by the temperature . however , for relatively small tunneling resistance ( @xmath3 ) or very low temperature , additional quantum processes such as higher - order co - tunneling contribute the peaks and renormalizes even its positions as well as associated quantum fluctuation is responsible for the broadening of the peaks.@xcite it is also found that these higher - order co - tunneling effects are manifested to noises of the system.@xcite on the other hand , in concerning about applications of sets to an electrometer , a slope of a coulomb - blockade peak with respect to gate voltages is an important factor . since the distance between peaks is equal to the change of an elementary charge on the gate , a large slope of the peaks means high sensitivity to a fraction of the charges .",
    "so , it is widely believed that a set is a prime candidate for reading out the final state of a qubit in a solid - state quantum computer.@xcite    new theoretical interests in transport properties through the strongly correlated systems are emerging together with the experimental success in driving them by microwaves ( radio - frequency waves ) , which are called radio - frequency single - electron transistors ( rf sets).@xcite in such a system , microwaves are delivered via a @xmath4-resonant circuit to excite particles to overcome the coulomb energy . as a consequence",
    ", sets can operate in a high - frequency domain and practically provides advantage of a large bandwidth as an electrometer , which allows to measure the rapid variation of gate charges.@xcite theoretically , the interplay of electronic transport and excitations by microwaves is a particular interest because high - frequency perturbations are expected to yield a new non - equilibrium situation resulted from additional phase variation in energy states.@xcite such a time - dependent situation is usually divided into classical and quantum regimes . in the classical regime ( or adiabatic regime ) energies excited by time - dependent perturbation appear to be continuous while in the quantum regime ( we will also refer to this as non - adiabatic regime ) discrete photon energies become observable and particles can emit or absorb photons when they tunnel from an initial state on one side of the barrier to a final state on the opposite side , called as photon - assisted tunneling.@xcite    so , in order to understand transport properties of rf sets , one may need generic theoretical considerations including higher - order co - tunneling processes as well as sequential tunneling , even in the quantum regime of time - dependent perturbations . actually , according to the recent experiments of rf",
    "sets,@xcite tunneling resistances range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , implying feasible co - tunneling processes for large values of @xmath7 .",
    "frequencies of microwaves were used from 0.3 to 1.7 ghz , which correspond to several @xmath8 of photon energies , comparable or larger than thermal energy in the experiments . for these values of frequencies ,",
    "it has been not known for the system to be driven in the classical or quantum regimes of time - dependent perturbations .",
    "so , in general it is necessary to solve problems in the quantum regime for more rigorous understanding of transport in rf sets .",
    "additionally , tunneling in a rf set may be dissipative due to a @xmath4 resonant circuit .",
    "since a microwave is delivered via a coaxial cable with @xmath9 impedance much smaller than the resistance quantum , effects of the electrical environment is usually ignored .",
    "this is the case for a @xmath4 resonant circuit with a low quality factor , however , with a high - quality factor , energy states of the electrical environment become long - lived because it becomes similar to a simple - harmonic oscillator.@xcite then , during tunneling , particles may emit or absorb energy quanta equal to resonant energy of the harmonic oscillator to the environment .    in this work",
    ", we develop the formalism that is capable of treating all above theoretical considerations ; the effects of higher - order co - tunneling , non - adiabatic time - dependent perturbations , and the electrical environments on operations of rf sets .",
    "our work is a generalization of several earlier works which address the effects partially , neglecting time - dependent perturbation,@xcite higher - order co - tunneling,@xcite and electron - electron interaction.@xcite however , since we use a two - charged - state model in a metallic island assuming large charging energy , along this aspect , our work is more restricted than ref . @xcite . in solving the problem",
    ", we use the schwinger - keldysh approach combined with a generating functional@xcite where pseudo - spins of two - charged states are treated with the drone - fermion mapping .",
    "since this approach includes any higher order moment of diagrams systematically , it is one of the well - suited methods for transport through strongly correlated system as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite . from a generating functional",
    "summed diagrammatically , observables of the system are obtained by functional derivatives with respect to external perturbations .",
    "this is another advantageous point of this approach because higher - order moments such as noise are easily calculated and expressions for observables are consistent with each other in a sense that they are derived from the same order of diagrams .",
    "we express the electrical environment in terms of infinite number of driven harmonic oscillator following caldeira and legget@xcite where external alternating voltages are treated with classical fields .",
    "based on the unitary transformation which leaves the electrical environment in a stationary situation , we incorporate equilibrium fluctuation of the environment into the generating functional and derive environment- and time - dependent self - energies by counting dominated diagrams .",
    "results for currents and noises are expressed in terms of transport coefficients . in cases of time - dependent perturbations , due to the displacement component currents",
    "are found to depend on an additional transport coefficient , leading to a generalization of the landauer formula@xcite and noises also has its contributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the model of calculations in section ii . by expressing the dissipative environment in terms of driven harmonic oscillators",
    ", we give the hamiltonian depending on tunneling currents . in section iii , we calculate an approximated generating functional based on the schwinger - keldysh approach and discuss several approximations in deriving it . for a given generating",
    "functional we show exact expressions for currents and noises in section iv and rewrite them in terms of transport coefficients . in section",
    "v , we use our formalism to simulate a rf set numerically and emphasize different points from static calculations .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section vi .",
    "to formulate the problem of a rf set , we begin with general circuital geometry of fig . [ setfig ] where time - dependent external sources , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are supplied via dissipative elements of impedances @xmath12 and @xmath13 .     , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in this section we do not specify detailed forms for @xmath12 and @xmath13 bearing in mind the application of our formalism to other systems concerning effects of dissipative environments.@xcite as a typical model of a set , a small island is coupled via tunneling barriers to two leads , source and drain , and also capacitively to source , drain , and gates with capacitances of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the small island is a metallic one , i.e. , there are many energy levels with negligibly small level spacing and also many particles occupied to them .",
    "in such a metallic island , one can treat a excess charge of @xmath17 confined in it as a independent variable from those of quasiparticles in a good approximation , and usually expresses its hamiltonian as,@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19(@xmath20 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators for quasiparticles with energy @xmath21 in the island and the index @xmath22 describes the transverse channels including spin .",
    "the second term is a coulomb - blockade model of the electron - electron interaction with @xmath23 .",
    "further simplification of the coulomb interaction term can be made if one uses a two - state model for excess charges .",
    "assuming the small island enough for charging energy @xmath24 to be the largest energy scale in the problem , it is sufficient to consider two number of charged states , say , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ". then , the charge operator @xmath17 becomes @xmath27 and satisfies @xmath28 ( throughout the work @xmath29 is the proton charge ) .",
    "if we adopt spinor notation , then the hamiltonian is further written as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the effective spin-1/2 operator and @xmath32 is the energy difference between the two charge states together with the charging energy @xmath33 . here",
    ", we anticipate @xmath34 which depends on a static component of a gate voltage @xmath35 through a charge of @xmath36 .    as for the remaining parts of the system",
    ", the hamiltonian can be found by separating it into terms depending on macroscopic and microscopic variables in a similar manner to ref . @xcite .",
    "then , the total hamiltonian may be written as the sum of the unperturbed part and the tunneling part @xmath37 ; @xmath38 here , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 represent the unperturbed part of our system , which are shown in fig .",

    "actually , the lumped circuit is designed to exhibit the same dynamical behavior as that of fig .",

    "here , the operators of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are inserted for the increase of excess charges in the island and the lead @xmath60 , respectively . from the commutation relation",
    "the operator @xmath64 can be shown to increase excess charges by the elementary charge @xmath29 in the lead @xmath60 for every tunneling event .",
    "the current @xmath65 flowing in each lead of fig .",
    "[ setfig ] is defined to be positive if it flows into the island , so that some of charges carrying the current are used to increase charges on the capacitor connected to the lead while the others tunnel into the metallic island .",

    "the current @xmath65 can be regarded as the sum of the displacement current and the particle current which are contributed from the macroscopic and microscopic system , respectively , @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "these currents automatically satisfy the current conservation relation of @xmath77 despite of time - dependent perturbations , as emphasized in ref .",
    "this is another consequence of the charge conservation that a gaussian surface enclosing three capacitors defining the island always contains zero total charges as inferred from eq .",

    ". the potential difference @xmath90 is given by , @xmath92 where the impedance matrix is defined as , @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "since the number operator @xmath95 is found to be invariant under the rotation , the transformation by @xmath96 may give rise to the simplest situation in calculating the tunneling currents . in this case , the electrical environment is in stationary conditions as implied from eq .",
    "( [ vteff ] ) , so that the first moment of its dynamics does not influence the tunneling currents , but the second moment , at least , starts to work .    instead of this benefit ,",
    "the rotated hamiltonian now depends on the tunneling currents .",
    "this implies that observables from the hamiltonian also depends on the tunneling currents unless both @xmath83 and @xmath84 in eq .",

    "actually , the function of @xmath416 is related to the current noises because the last term of eq .",
    "( [ si2 ] ) is approximately equal to it neglecting geometrical factors between capacitances . by comparing it with the current noises ,",
    "we find that a large portion of the difference in the current noise can be associated with those in the charge noises .    for high frequencies ,",

    "@xcite , we use similar system parameters to the experiment except for @xmath399 ( unfortunately not specified in the experiment ) . to clarify calculated results we omit the regions of poor sensitivity , which correspond to smaller rf - wave amplitudes than the coulomb blockade thresholds ( lower left corner ) and much higher rf - wave amplitude over the threshold with small excitation energies ( upper right corner ) . by comparing fig .",
    "[ senfig]-(a ) and ( b ) , one can see effects of photon - assistant tunneling to the sensitivity .",
    "that is , the region of good sensitivity ( for example , within @xmath423 ) is predicted to slowly vary as a function of rf - wave amplitude than in the adiabatic limits , while it exhibits a rather narrower region as a function of gate charge .",
    "calculated optimum sensitivities ( minimum value of @xmath424 ) are also found to have different values , @xmath425 , and @xmath426 for the exact , adiabatic , and orthodox formalism , respectively , with a nearly same operating point of @xmath427 . the slightly better optimum - sensitivity in fig .",
    "[ senfig]-@xmath375 compared with that in @xmath376 comes from the enhanced value of the response @xmath428 by photon - assisted tunneling",
    ". however , photon - assisted tunneling does not always give the better sensitivity because it also enhances current noises .",
    "we find that its role for the sensitivity depends on system parameters . in the orthodox result ,",
    "the sensitivity is always predicted to be better than results of the others because the absence of co - tunneling gives larger values of the response @xmath428 .    using the experimental parameter of @xmath429 , the calculated optimum sensitivity @xmath430 corresponds to @xmath431 , which is lower than the measured value of @xmath432 by an order .",
    "this discrepancy between the theory and experiment may be attributed to the preamplifier noise and local heating of a set.@xcite     in @xmath375 and @xmath383 in @xmath376 , respectively , together with different frequencies of a microwave , @xmath433 ( dotted ) , @xmath434 ( solid ) , and @xmath435 ( dashed ) .",

    "[ senq0fig ] , we show the dependence of the optimum sensitivity on tunneling resistances for different applied frequencies of microwaves and quality factors .",
    "firstly , figs .",
    "[ senq0fig]-@xmath375 and @xmath376 are results for @xmath400 and @xmath383 , respectively . by comparing different kinds of lines in each figure which means different frequencies of microwaves at a resonant condition",
    ", one can see that larger frequencies give rise to worse sensitives in a wide range of tunneling resistance .",
    "since a large driving frequency corresponds to better - resolved energies of external fields , associated photon - assisted tunneling is expected to decrease the sensitivity due to the enhanced current noises .",
    "on the other hand , for a given frequency , the sensitivity as a function of tunneling resistance is found to show different behavior depending on the quality factor ; monotonically improved results are obtained for @xmath400 as tunneling resistance decreases while there is optimal resistance for the best sensitivity for @xmath438 . for easier understanding of our results , an analytic expression from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath439 is also plotted with dot - dashed lines in the figure even though it gives difference values from ours due to the orthodox theory . according to this expression ,",
    "since the sensitivity is proportional to @xmath440 for @xmath441 , one can see that calculated results are approximately scaled as the same power law",
    ". however , for @xmath438 , the power law is no longer hold and for small tunneling resistances it is scaled as even @xmath442 .",
    "this behavior can be understood through a simple circuital analysis as in ref .",
    "@xcite by replacing the tunneling barriers by resistors , it is found that the best sensitivity is achieved for series resistance equal to @xmath443 at which input impedance of microwaves is matched to that of the tunneling barriers .",
    "thus , for @xmath400 the matching condition occurs at @xmath444 while for @xmath438 it is expected to be @xmath445 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ senq0fig]-@xmath376 , this condition well agrees with the calculated result for the small frequency even though for high frequencies it is slightly deviated due to the non - adiabatic effects of microwaves .    in fig .",
    "[ senq0fig]-@xmath387 we show the dependence of the charge sensitivity on tunneling resistances by omitting a calculational factor one by one to emphasize its role . according to results , considerations of self - consistent and non",
    "- adiabatic schemes are found to be crucial for sensitivity calculations while effects of the environment is relatively unimportant .",
    "in addition , we find that symmetric geometry ( dashed line ) benefits the charge sensitivity in the whole range of tunneling resistance .",
    "in this work , we develop a formalism for a radio - frequency single - electron transistor taking into account electrical environment , higher - order co - tunneling , and arbitrary time - dependent perturbations .",
    "assuming large charging energy , we use a two - charged - state model in a metallic island and solved the problem based on the schwinger - keldysh approach combined with a generating functional method .",
    "we calculate an approximated generating functional by summing diagrams in infinite order and give exact expressions for current , charges in the island , and their noises within the generating functional . by defining generalized transport coefficients ,",
    "we write the derived expressions in terms of them , and show that tunneling currents in time - dependence cases have a generalized form of the well - known landauer formula . as application of our formalism ,",
    "we examine tunneling currents , its noises , and the charge sensitivity of rf - sets by accounting for a detailed tank circuit .",
    "firstly , effects of the electrical environments are found to be relatively small , as expected , in cases of microwaves delivered via an coaxial cable with impedance @xmath9 .",
    "however , for a large quality factor and a large resonant frequency its effects become large and can not be ignored .",
    "secondly , effects of photon - assisted tunneling are manifested to both enhanced responses and noises of rf sets . however , due to the larger enhancement of the noises , photon - assisted tunneling is not helpful to the charge sensitivity . as a consequence , with experimental parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the charge sensitivity of @xmath446 , which is larger than that in the orthodox result , however , still much smaller than the measure value of @xmath447 .",
    "finally , we discuss the charge sensitivity depending on various sets of parameters .",
    "especially , we focus on its change as a function of tunneling resistance , and find that the charge sensitivity for small quality factors is scaled like @xmath440 as in the analytic result proposed by the previous work . whereas , for large quality factors the power law is no longer valid and it is proportional to even @xmath442 in the range of small tunneling resistance to show optimal resistance for the best sensitivity .",
