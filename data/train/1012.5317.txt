    "the sensitivity of dark matter ( dm ) direct detection experiments is undergoing rapid progress and is expected to continue in the next decade .",
    "there are a number of proposed experiments which will probe complementary aspects of dark matter properties with much better sensitivities than the existing ones : dm mass , spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) cross sections , the dependence of the cross sections on the target nuclei , directional information , etc .",
    "the focus , rightly , is often on the detection of spin - independent dm interactions , because , due to a coherence effect , the si interaction cross section with heavy nuclei is enhanced by @xmath0 , the number of nucleons in a nucleus , and is , therefore , expected in many models to be the dominant interaction in dm detectors .",
    "there is a good chance that , in the not - too - distant future , direct detection experiments will be able to extend their sensitivity to cover the full detectable parameter space for si cross sections , down to the @xmath1 level , below which atmospheric neutrinos constitute an irreducible background .",
    "prior studies  @xcite have considered the relationship between si and sd cross sections , concluding that the two are typically correlated when a viable dark matter candidate is present .",
    "most of the discussions have been in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "( similar statements have been made about dm candidates in universal extra dimensions  @xcite and little higgs models  @xcite , as well . ) in general , the common wisdom is that si experiments have a much better chance of first direct detection discovery .",
    "the generality of this conclusion can not be addressed by merely considering operators ; one must explore the underlying models which determine relationships between operator coefficients .",
    "for example , the conclusions stated above ultimately stemmed from the assumption of dm with electroweak charges , which generically implies both mediators with at least weak - scale masses to justify null results thus far and couplings to the higgs leading to si signals .",
    "once this condition is relaxed , the relationship between si and sd cross sections becomes weaker , and models in which sd interactions are more easily accessible , or even the only interaction accessible in direct detection experiments , become feasible .    here",
    "we point out that in order to impose the last condition , i.e. , uniquely sd detection , the consideration of subleading effects is crucial . since , due to coherence effects , si experiments are more sensitive than sd ones ( currently by 5 orders of magnitude ) , a loop - induced si process might be only marginally more difficult or possibly even as easy to detect than a tree - level sd one . upon considering these additional operators , we find that models with light pseudoscalars are uniquely capable of generically evading such detection modes .",
    "although several ingredients of our analysis appear in the literature  @xcite , the impact of light mediators on a general analysis of operators has not been heretofore discussed , and the effect of loop corrections on dm scattering has not been considered in this context . in sec .",
    "[ sec : det ] , we review current bounds on si and sd cross sections and the expected improvements . sec .",
    "[ sec : oper ] then constitutes the bulk of the paper .",
    "we discuss operators relevant for the detection of dm particles , including operators which become important in the case of light mediators .",
    "we then consider which models could generate exclusively sd interactions , and calculate the loop - induced interactions that would simultaneously be present . in sec .",
    "[ sec : axion ] we construct a viable model achieving our goals , in which the si interaction is out of reach , but the sd interaction may be detected in future experiments .",
    "[ sec : conc ] concludes .",
    "the best si bounds come at present from xenon10  @xcite , cdms  @xcite , and xenon100  @xcite , with the highest sensitivity from xenon100 near @xmath2 at @xmath3 . in general ,",
    "optimal sensitivity is for dm masses of order the mass of the recoiling nucleus . at higher masses ,",
    "the sensitivity decreases roughly as @xmath4 . within the coming years",
    ", xenon100 , lux , and supercdms can improve these bounds down to the @xmath5 or possibly near the @xmath6 level .",
    "ultimately multi - ton xenon or germanium experiments can achieve sensitivities to @xmath7 or maybe even @xmath1 , at which point atmospheric neutrinos form an irreducible background  @xcite , and achieving sensitivity to lower si dm - nucleon interactions seem unfeasible .    for sd detection ,",
    "the best current limit for dm - proton interaction is near @xmath8 from simple  @xcite , with slightly weaker bounds from coupp  @xcite , kims  @xcite , and picasso  @xcite , at similar optimal masses as above . for dm - neutron cross sections the best bound",
    "is from xenon10  @xcite at @xmath9 at optimal sensitivity near 30  . within the next few years , coupp  @xcite , picasso  @xcite , and",
    "xenon100 should improve these to @xmath10 , for both protons and neutrons .",
    "these limits could then be extended to near @xmath11 with experiments such as dmtpc , or to @xmath12 for a 500 kg extension of coupp  @xcite .",
    "bounds on direct detection cross sections can also come indirectly from other experiments .",
    "one source is from dm annihilation signals from the sun .",
    "the annihilation at equilibrium is proportional to the rate of dm capture , which is driven by the same interactions as direct detection . in this case",
    "the si terms are not so strongly enhanced over the sd ones , since this capture is mostly due to light nuclei , almost entirely hydrogen and helium .",
    "( some enhancement does occur due to small amounts of fe and o , but bounding the sd interaction neglecting the si contribution is conservative . )",
    "super - kamiokande  @xcite and icecube  @xcite used this to place limits on sd proton interactions at around @xmath13 , assuming annihilations primarily to @xmath14 . above @xmath15 ,",
    "icecube could even place a bound at @xmath16 if the dm annihilated to @xmath17 .",
    "however , these indirect bounds do not apply in the case of light mediators which will be discussed below , since if the annihilations proceed through a light on - shell particle , decays to neither heavy quarks nor @xmath18 bosons occur .",
    "other bounds can be placed from constraints on operators from collider searches  @xcite . in cases",
    "where the mediator can be integrated out , these searches place bounds on interactions of very light dark matter better than those of direct detection , while remaining competitive with them for sd interactions of dm that can be directly produced at the tevatron .",
    "the expected lhc reach is expected to also remain competitive with direct detection sensitivites of upcoming expierments  @xcite . however , for mediators light enough to be produced on - shell , the bound deteriorates rapidly  @xcite , and is also not applicable for the class of models we discuss below .",
    ".operators relevant for scalar dark matter detection .",
    "the suppression factor given is for the relevant cross section .",
    "operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 are only allowed for complex scalars . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are a large number of operators that could mediate sd interactions . however ,",
    "for our purposes , some of these may be ignored right away .",
    "for example , @xmath21 and @xmath22 lead to both sd and si interactions of comparable magnitudes .",
    "it may naively seem that all operators that come with kinematic suppression factors can be dismissed just as easily .",
    "after all , with dm in the galactic halo at such low velocities , the nonrelativistic limit is appropriate for detection , and traditionally such operators have indeed been neglected .",
    "let us examine this assumption more carefully .    within the dominant wimp paradigm",
    ", the mediator has typically been assumed to be at the weak scale , with direct detection occurring with @xmath23 momentum transfers and @xmath24 recoil energies . in that case",
    ", the integrated - out mediator sets the scale of the operators through a factor of @xmath25 . in the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "terms like @xmath26 are suppressed by factors of @xmath27 or @xmath28 , while others , like @xmath29 , have some components scale as @xmath30 .",
    "operators with any of these factor can typically be dismissed , because they are suppressed by @xmath31 .",
    "this means that , even if present , such interactions can be ignored .",
    "for example , in the case of majorana fermion dark matter , such as the neutralino in supersymmetric models , the only two operators that need to be considered are scalar  scalar and axial - vector  axial - vector  @xcite ; all others are highly suppressed .",
    "however , recent interest in explaining various possibly dm - related anomalies have introduced models with @xmath32 mediator particles . in this case , if the leading operators were suppressed or forbidden for some symmetry reason , the traditionally subleading operators could lead to contributions of the correct magnitude to be accessible to current or future direct detection experiments . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these two statements may in fact be connected , since the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry forbidding the appearance of certain operators can provide for a natural explanation for the presence of light ( pseudo ) nambu  goldstone scalars .",
    "this opens up new possibilities .",
    "if si operators without kinematic suppression factors are forbidden or highly suppressed for other reasons , the set of operators which may lead to a detectable sd signal becomes much larger .",
    "if we wish to remain agnostic about the nature of the dm - nucleon interactions , we can say no more .",
    "however , if a further step is to be taken , it seems most conservative to assume that the dm comes from some theory with renormalizable interactions in which the operators leading to direct detection come from heavy states that have been integrated out .",
    "one can then ask what sort of renormalizable interactions could lead to the operators given above .",
    "such a procedure was followed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we quote their results , along with the additional possibilities afforded by interactions yielding kinematically suppressed operators .",
    "for scalar dm , the only option for generating solely sd operators seems to be a @xmath33-channel exchange of a light pseudoscalar , which yields @xmath34 .",
    "while such an interaction breaks parity , given that parity is badly broken already in the standard model ( sm ) , this is not a serious concern .    for fermionic dm , several possibilities present themselves .",
    "once again a @xmath33-channel light pseudoscalar exchange produces solely sd interactions via @xmath35 .",
    "additionally , for majorana fermions , the @xmath33-channel exchange of a vector with axial couplings , either the sm @xmath36 or a new @xmath37 , will generate only a single kinematically unsuppressed operator , @xmath38 .",
    "other options are an @xmath39 or @xmath40-channel coupling through either a scalar or vector , provided the couplings are chiral , in which case @xmath38 is generated again .",
    "if the couplings are not chiral , @xmath41 is produced as well .",
    "finally , for vector dm , a light pseudoscalar in the @xmath33 channel produces only @xmath42 , which breaks parity as in the scalar case .",
    "alternatively an @xmath39 or @xmath40-channel coupling through a fermion makes @xmath43 the leading operator , if the coupling is chiral while the vector boson is real .",
    "suppose that one is presented with a model in which one of the above sd interactions is the only one present , or dominant over other by many orders of magnitude .",
    "does that mean that only an experiment sensitive to sd interactions would see a signal ?",
    "not necessarily .",
    "the bounds on si cross sections are currently 57 orders of magnitude higher than the sd ones , and this looks to continue to be the case in the future",
    ". therefore if any of the sd interactions discussed above induce subleading si couplings , such an effect could potentially be visible in a si experiment .",
    "there are two sources for such effects .",
    "first , there are kinematically suppressed contributions of tree level scattering that were ignored above .",
    "these are easily estimated from tables  [ tab : soper][tab : voper ] given earlier .",
    "second , the tree - level sd interactions can induce si couplings at loop level .",
    "these are not as simple to estimate , and should be calculated to confirm their effect .",
    "let us consider a @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 exchange ) with a majorana fermion , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : zexchtree ] .",
    "while the dominant contribution comes from @xmath38 , also present is @xmath21 , the anapole coupling .",
    "we see that this gives rise to a si interaction suppressed by @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , both the scalar exchange of fig .",
    "[ fig : fexchtree ] and the equivalent diagram for vector exchange give an anapole coupling after using fiertz identities .",
    "a fermion exchange of the same form in the case of vector dm produces @xmath22 as well as @xmath43 in the chiral limit , which again mediates a @xmath44 suppressed si coupling . in all of these cases",
    ", there is a si scattering cross section no more than @xmath45 smaller than the sd one , independent of any other field content of a model .",
    "this means that such interactions would be seen in si experiments simultaneously or in the next generation of experiements after they appear in sd ones .",
    "only the pseudoscalar exchanges evade this , as they lead to no @xmath44 suppressed subleading contributions to dm - nucleon scattering at all .",
    "all the aforementioned interactions should also be computed at the one - loop level .",
    "while these will be suppressed by loop factors and extra couplings , they may also generate si interactions . for large enough couplings",
    ", these loops might even give rise to interactions larger than the kinematically - suppressed ones discussed above , and so might be even more readily detectable .    without making any further assumptions about the underlying model",
    ", we can already identify diagrams which will produce si interactions at loop - level .",
    "for sd interactions involving a @xmath33-channel exchange , at a minimum , exchanging two mediators in a box diagram will give rise to a si interaction .",
    "for an @xmath39 or @xmath40-channel processes , a si loop level contribution can come from a loop with @xmath18 or @xmath36 bosons exchanged between the quarks .",
    "consider the exchange of a @xmath36 with axial couplings to quarks .",
    "( we will discuss the case of a @xmath37 shortly . ) in that case , the quark level operator for tree - level scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zexchtree ] ) is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the coupling of the dm to the @xmath36 .",
    "then the dm - proton sd cross section generated is ( see apps .",
    "[ app : matel ] and [ app : xsec ] for details ) @xmath48 with the dm - neutron cross sections about 20% smaller . in this case ,",
    "two one - loop processes lead to si effective interactions : one with two @xmath36 exchanges , and a higgs coupling through a @xmath36 loop to the dm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zexchloops ] ) .",
    "we work in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "( this limit is generally the one in which the dm has the correct relic abundance in models where the only coupling of the dm to the quarks is through electroweak bosons , while foregoing the last inequality only yields @xmath50 changes , see ref .",
    "the si contribution to the effective coupling is then  @xcite ] which all simplify to @xmath51 on shell , but can have different nuclear matrix elements , to their on - shell value .",
    "in fact this seems to yield a conservative estimate , as out of the nuclear matrix elements known , the first one has the smallest value ( for a detailed discussion of these issues see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath52 m_q\\ , \\bar{\\chi}\\chi\\ , \\bar{q}q\\,.\\ ] ] taking a reference value of @xmath53 , this interactions will induce a si cross section of @xmath54 asking that the sd signal be just beyond current sd experimental bounds implies @xmath55 , giving a si cross section of @xmath56 .",
    "this , while not detectable in experiments underway , is feasible with ones in preparation .",
    "this result would make the @xmath44-suppressed constribution to si scattering dominant .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that this cross section acts as a lower bound  it could be that the dm particle is part of larger representation of @xmath57 , in which case additional loops involving @xmath18s would also contribute .",
    "generally , the size off the cross section grows as @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the dimension of the representation  @xcite , making it possible for the loop contribution to be dominant , and not merely competitive with the kinetically suppressed contribution , and even being large enough to be discovered simultaneously with the sd signal .",
    "if one wishes to consider models with a new @xmath37 , then the existence of a @xmath37 with higgs coupling becomes model dependent . to talk about a lower bound",
    ", we can then ignore the contribution of the second term in the effective coupling .",
    "the heavier mediator mass that such a model would entail would have to be offset with a larger coupling in order to be detectable .",
    "thus , at loop level , one would generally expect the effective interaction to be of at least similar size , or possibly larger , due to the higher power of the coupling appearing in the loop - induced term",
    ".    if one considers the possibility of a light @xmath37 , which are not ruled out by collider constraints down to the gev range for gauge couplings smaller than the sm by @xmath60 , the situation discussed above would be reversed , and one would expect a smaller loop - induced contribution . however , the si contribution due to kinematically suppressed operators is insensitive to changes in the mediator mass , and would still be present . constructing a model without such operators and without significant",
    "fine - tuning seems extremely difficult .",
    "it is difficult to say more in generality , due to the large freedom in assigning masses and charges under a new gauge group .",
    "now let us consider dm with chiral couplings to the sm via an @xmath39 or @xmath40-channel .",
    "the most model - independent loop - level processes here come from box diagrams with the quarks exchanging a @xmath18 or @xmath36 boson , an example of which is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fexchloops ] . the contributions of the loops have completely different forms depending on whether the coupling of the dm is left- or right - handed .",
    "however , in all cases the loop - level processes only give rise to suppressed sd contributions .",
    "in addition to dm of the form in fig .  [",
    "fig : fexch ] , this is also true for the cases of fermionic dm with a vector mediator and vector dm with a fermion mediator of similar topologies . in this case , we find that the most reliable lower bound on a si cross section in this case comes from the @xmath44 suppressed contribution to the tree - level interaction discussed earlier .",
    "finally , let us turn to the box diagrams induced in the cases of light pseudoscalar exchange , fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudloops ] .",
    "first , we consider the case of scalar dm . at tree level ,",
    "the operator obtained after integrating out the pseudoscalar is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the yukawa coupling of the quark , so @xmath63 absorbs both the coupling of the dm and mediator , and any scaling to yukawas of the mediator - quark coupling .",
    "this leads to a a tree - level cross section of @xmath64 ( see app .  [",
    "app : xsec ] for the definition of the cross section in cases of kinematically suppressed operators . ) for a mediator with mass of a few gev and @xmath65 , this would be accessible to currently running searches",
    ".    the calculation of the loop diagram in the same limits as the previous @xmath36-mediated case does not give as compact of an answer , but can be expressed in closed form in terms of passarino  veltman scalar integrals  @xcite , computed with the use of feyncalc  @xcite as    @xmath66\\ ,    \\phi^\\dagger \\partial^\\mu \\phi\\ , \\bar{q}\\gamma_\\mu q. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    a numerical evaluation of the coefficients show the @xmath67 and @xmath68 functions with these parameters to scale as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , beyond their overall @xmath71 dependence .",
    "using a fiducial value of @xmath72 gives @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "note that if the dm were real , this operator vanishes identically , and there is no loop induced coupling at one loop order at all .",
    "if present , the cross section induced is @xmath75 undetectable for any any choice of parameters that would make the sd cross section detectable .",
    "the case of vector dm is very similar .",
    "for @xmath76 the tree - level cross section takes the same value as eq .",
    "( [ eq : scxsec ] ) . meanwhile , the loop induced coupling is @xmath77    \\bigg\\}\\ ,    b_\\nu^\\dagger\\ , \\partial^\\mu b^\\nu\\ , \\bar{q}\\gamma_\\mu q\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] which numerically evaluates to @xmath78 with @xmath79 very close to the scalar case , giving a loop induced si cross section as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scloopxsec ] ) , and similarly giving no contribution if the dm were real .",
    "the case of fermionic dm is slightly different .",
    "this is because the tree - level operator responsible for scattering is @xmath80 and , therefore , is parametrically suppressed by @xmath81 , instead of the previous cases @xmath82 .",
    "the tree level cross section then becomes @xmath83 we see that due to the greater momentum suppression , we require a lighter mediator mass and can not afford the coupling of the dm to be as small as in the bosonic case above . in this case a cross section detectable in current experiments would require , for example , a mediator with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "meanwhile , the effective coupling from computing the loop diagram in the same limits as the other cases is @xmath86\\ ,      \\bar{\\chi}\\gamma^\\mu\\chi\\ , \\bar{q}\\gamma_\\mu q\\\\    & + \\frac{3}{8 } \\big[1 + b_0(m_\\chi^2;0,m_\\chi^2 ) - b_0(0;m_a^2,m_a^2 )       + 4 m_\\chi^2\\ , c_0(m_\\chi^2,0,m_\\chi^2;m_\\chi^2,m_a^2,0 )      - m_\\chi^2\\ , c_0(m_\\chi^2,m_\\chi^2,0;m_a^2,m_\\chi^2,m_a^2)\\\\    & + 3 m_a^2 m_\\chi^2\\ ,    d_0(m_\\chi^2,m_\\chi^2,0,0,0,m_\\chi^2;m_a^2,m_\\chi^2,m_a^2,0 ) \\big]\\ ,      \\frac{m_q}{m_\\chi}\\ , \\bar{\\chi}\\chi\\ , \\bar{q } q \\bigg\\}\\ , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    which numerically yields @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the magnitudes of these coefficients can be understood as arising from the @xmath69 and @xmath70 behavior of @xmath67 and @xmath68 mentioned above .",
    "the loop - level cross section is then @xmath90 we will confirm below in the explicit model of sec .",
    "[ sec : axion ] that the loop induced coupling is indeed tiny , but it is simple to see here why this is generically so .",
    "unlike in the massive mediator cases , there are two mass scales in the dark sector , that of the dm itself and that of the mediator . at tree level",
    ", the lighter mediator mass is the one that appears in the denominator of the operator .",
    "however , at loop level , the value of the loop integral is parametrically controlled by the mass of the dm , the heaviest particle in the loop .",
    "additionally , a pseudoscalar which is the nambu",
    " goldstone boson of a broken symmetry would be expected to couple to quarks proportional to the masses of the quarks .",
    "thus , at loop level , the effective operator would be expected to be suppressed by extra factors of quark yukawa couplings .",
    "together , both effects combine to make the loop - level coupling to be as many as 20 orders smaller than the tree level one , with higher order corrections to the non - relativistic scattering approximation coming at similar orders as @xmath91 , so that the si induced interaction is expected to be completely negligible .",
    "we have just seen that without tuning of couplings , models with light pseudoscalar mediators provide the unique method of avoiding any si signal , while still producing a sd direct detection signature .",
    "now we turn to the question of whether a viable model producing dm with the correct abundance can have these features .",
    "coupling a light pseudoscalar to quarks is most efficiently achieved by adding a scalar field which spontaneously breaks a global symmetry , and which , by mixing with the higgs , gets a coupling to the sm . allowing this scalar to have a new global charge , while adding new fermions charged under the same symmetry , ensures that the new scalar field is the only method for the new fermions to interact with the sm .    as a simple realization of such a mechanism , where the dominant interaction is @xmath92 via a pseudoscalar interaction , we introduce , following ref .",
    "@xcite , a scalar field charged under a new global @xmath93 charge that is spontaneously broken to @xmath94 this scalar field is coupled to a new fermion , which is vector - like under the sm , through @xmath95 , so that after the scalar field acquires a vacuum expectation value , the fermion receives a mass of @xmath96 , allowing it to act as dark matter , with stability ensured by the remnant of @xmath93 after breaking .    in order for the pseudoscalar to interact with the sm , some known particles must also carry charges under the new @xmath93 . in a two higgs doublet model ,",
    "this can be accomplished by adding a term of the form @xmath97 by assigning the appropriate charges to the higgses and sm fermions , and promoting the @xmath93 to a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry . for @xmath98 ,",
    "this coupling is of the same form as in the case of the dfsz axion  @xcite , while the @xmath99 case functions like that of the pq - symmetric limit of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite we now have a dark matter candidate coupling to the sm though a massive scalar and an axionlike nambu  goldstone boson .",
    "the nambu ",
    "goldstone boson is assumed to get a small mass through an unspecified mechanism .",
    "anticipating making the scalar heavy , by virtue of @xmath100 a choice of , say , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( corresponding to @xmath103 ) yields a cross section of @xmath104 and so generates the correct order of magnitude for the relic abundance  @xcite .    for direct detection ,",
    "two channels present themselves .",
    "the scalar gives a si cross section through the operator @xmath105 , due to mixing of the scalar with the two @xmath106-even higgses , while the light axionlike state yields a sd interaction , @xmath92 , by a similar mixing with the @xmath106-odd higgs . for our purposes , we need check whether this tree - level si cross section can be small enough to be completely negligible .",
    "the mixing of the scalar with the two @xmath106-even higgs has a lot of arbitrariness to it due to the 11 constants in the most general @xmath107-preserving two - higgs - doublet and one - singlet potential .",
    "however , we can say that barring accidental cancellations , this mixing will be @xmath108 , so that we may write the tree - level si cross section as @xmath109 ( see app .",
    "[ app : matel ] for a caveat on the values of the nuclear matrix elements in this calculation . ) in the model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath110 needed to be light , @xmath111 , in order to provide a mechanism for sommerfeld enhancement to explain astrophysical anomalies . in that case , the direct detection cross section was in tension with the si bound and could only be slightly beyond current limits , at @xmath112 .",
    "however , if we impose no such condition , @xmath110 could be larger .",
    "if it is at the electroweak scale , then the cross section is at most @xmath113 , smaller than the sensitivity of the next generation of direct detection experiments . if @xmath114 , a reasonable choice given the scale of @xmath115 in this setup , then the cross section becomes undetectably small , below the irreducible atmospheric neutrino limit .",
    "let us next consider the pseudoscalar channel . with the interaction kinetically suppressed by the momentum transfer as @xmath81 , we can not merely compute the cross section in the limit of @xmath116 as we did in the scalar exchange case .",

    "we see that given a dm mass @xmath102 , a pseudoscalar with a mass @xmath121 generates a cross section of @xmath122 , within the range of the next generation of direct sd detection experiments .",
    "in fact , in a two higgs doublet model like this , the nuclear matrix element also has a dependence on @xmath123 as up - type quarks couple with a coefficient proportional to @xmath124 , while down type ones couple proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "we have evaluated the matrix elements for the above cross section at @xmath126 . at large values of @xmath125",
    "the cross section can rise by almost 2 orders of magnitude .",

    "as before , we evaluate the nuclear matrix elements at @xmath126 , but this time , varying @xmath125 can not only modify the cross section by a factor of @xmath50 as the suppression of @xmath127 at high @xmath125 is too strong , so we find @xmath128 with no additional implicit @xmath125 dependence .",
    "as the sensitivity of both si and sd direct dm detection experiments increases , it is worth asking to what extent the discovery potential of the two methods is complementary . in this work",
    "we have pointed out that when one considers the full range of possible mediators , instead of being confined to new weak - scale particles , the range of possible viable interactions generating sd cross sections increases . at the same time , when one searches for interactions for which sd experiments are complimentary for discovery  ones which could not be seen in any si experiments without the need for accidental cancellations or other tuning",
    " it becomes necessary to take into account subleading contributions to scattering , such as suppressed operators and loop processes .",
    "the outcome is that the traditional models considered also generically produce si interactions whose suppression is counterbalanced by the greater sensitivity of si experiments .",
    "the list of viable candidates whose interaction with the sm can be described by tree - level mediators integrated out in a renormalizable model is then reduced to merely ones mediated by light pseudoscalars .",
    "we have presented a realistic model of such interactions that generates the right dm abundance with a fermionic dm candidate without having other interactions generating detectable si interactions .",
    "similar scenarios can also be considered with a scalar or vector dark matter candidate . just as in the case of fermionic dm",
    ", @xmath129 gives the leading interaction in the nonrelativistic limit , while @xmath130 is kinematically suppressed .",
    "the necessary couplings between the pseudoscalar and the scalars or vectors can not be generated in as simple a manner as those used above , so more model building will be required . however , the suppression is only by @xmath82 , so the mass differences between the scalar and pseudoscalar do not have to be quite as large , and the couplings themselves can be smaller , so that the parameter space of couplings and the pseudoscalar mass are not as tightly limited by experiment , potentially making the exercise worthwhile .",

    "here we summarize how to compute the dark matter - nucleon interaction cross sections from quark - level interactions .",
    "much of this has been discussed in the dm literature , with the exception of the pseudoscalar matrix element , as it only plays a role in momentum suppressed cross sections .    for a vector coupling ,",
    "nuclear matrix elements are straightforward to compute , since a vector coupling to quarks is a conserved current , so the coupling to a nucleon is obtained from the sum of the currents of the valence quarks .    in the case of a scalar coupling to quarks , we are interested in the effective nucleon coupling induced by a quark level coupling : @xmath131 we define the nuclear matrix elements conventionally by @xmath132 on including the coupling to gluons induced by integrating out heavy quark loops , @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "unlike the @xmath40 and @xmath136 matrix elements , which can be extracted from @xmath137 scattering , the uncertainty associated with the strange quark matrix element @xmath138 is higher , which introduces a substantial uncertainty in the si coupling to nucleons .",
    "most studies use numerical values @xmath139 based on older calculations . a representative set of values is that used by the darksusy package  @xcite , wherein , @xmath140 these are the values used for the numerical estimates given above , and in most of the literature .",
    "however , recent lattice qcd results give substantially smaller values , @xmath141  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , and so the si cross section from scalar exchange ( if it couples proportionally to mass ) may be smaller by a factor of @xmath142@xmath143 than numerical results quoted by many calculations .    for sd interaction",
    "we need to consider the nuclear matrix elements induced by the quark level axial - vector and pseudoscalar couplings , @xmath144 and @xmath145 for the axial - vector current , defining @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the spin of the nucleon , we have @xmath148 the matrix elements coming from polarized deep inelastic scattering carry much smaller uncertainties than for the scalar si interaction above . for our numerical results ,",
    "we use again the darksusy values , @xmath149 more recent determinations favor slightly different values , and the pdg quotes @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , with a 0.02 uncertainty for each  @xcite ; the effect on our numerical results is negligible .    for the pseudoscalar current in eq .",
    "( [ sdpseudoscalar ] ) the nucleon - level coupling is determined by the same axial - vector matrix elements above .",
    "the relationship is established through generalized goldberger  treiman relations . while not normally considered in dark matter detection , it has been well - studied in the axion literature  @xcite .",
    "taking divergences of the axial currents and using the equations of motion for the quarks yields  @xcite @xmath153 where @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , while @xmath157 is the mean of the quark coupling coefficients .",
    "due to uncertainties in the value of @xmath158 , the value of @xmath159 can vary by as much as a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "in this appendix , we provide a summary of cross sections for dm - nucleon interactions relevant for calculating the various cross sections discussed above in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "we first consider the unsuppressed operors in the limit of zero momentum transfer .",

    "interactions mediated by light pseudoscalars are all zero , so we need another way of expressing such cross sections .",
    "to do so , we will use the fact that while in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath177 , @xmath178 , so that using the results above we can write ( since @xmath179 in the nonrelativistic limit ) .",
    "@xmath180 we then compute the cross section as above , and quote a result at a reference value of @xmath82 .",
