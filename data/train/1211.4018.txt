    "the tools we construct should be useful in other contexts .",

    "we describe them and at the same time give an outline for the rest of the paper .    1 .",

    "the theory requires the complexes being acted upon to have certain connectivity properties , and our contribution is to verify these properties .",
    "2 .   our second ingredient is an action of @xmath131 on @xmath143 that is compatible ( via @xmath154 ) with the action of @xmath131 on @xmath129 $ ] in a sense made precise by proposition  [ proposition : spaction ] .",
    "we construct the action by declaring where each generator of @xmath131 sends each generator of @xmath143 and then checking that all relations in both groups are satisfied .",
