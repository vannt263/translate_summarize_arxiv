    "the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars is one of the most fundamental and crucial ingredients in models of galaxy formation and stellar evolution .",
    "it determines several key parameters in stellar populations , such as the yield of heavy elements , the mass - to - light ratio , luminosity evolution over time , and the energy input into the interstellar medium .",
    "the determination of the imf is therefore of great astrophysical importance .",
    "the imf of low - mass stars is of special interest in this context , since they contain a major fraction of the stellar mass , and have been hypothesized to contain a significant fraction of the total mass in the universe ( see , e.g. , fukugita , hogan and peebles , 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we mainly deal with objects having masses less than 0.5@xmath8 , the lowest mass of the detectable objects being as low as 0.025@xmath8 .",
    "these low - mass stars evolve little over the lifetime of the universe , and hence the observed present day mass function of these stars is likely to be a good representation of their imf .",
    "but , the imf at or below the hbml remains poorly known , mainly for two reasons .",
    "first , such objects are faint and hence difficult to detect .",
    "second , the mass - luminosity relation of these objects is uncertain and model - dependent , and hence their mass determination is imprecise .",
    "significant improvements are being made on both these aspects , as described below .",
    "the difficulty caused by their faintness can be greatly alleviated by concentrating on young , low - mass objects since the low - mass stars at or below the hbml are expected to be warmer and more luminous when young , although they rapidly cool and fade with age ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 , dantona & mazzitelli 1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "hence young and nearby open clusters provide a good opportunity to study the low end of the stellar imf , since the suitable combination of their youth and proximity makes it possible to detect objects well below the hbml in these clusters , particularly at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass - luminosity relation has been greatly reduced by the tremendous progress in the theoretical models for the evolution of these cool and dense objects over the past few years .",
    "these models play a crucial role in predicting masses of these low - mass objects from the observable quantities like colors and luminosities .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have generated models of spectra , colors and evolution of brown dwarfs using nongrey calculations .",
    "their models span the mass range of 0.3@xmath9 to 70@xmath9 ( where @xmath9 refers to the mass of jupiter ) with effective temperatures varying from @xmath71300 k to 100 k. dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) simulate the evolution of objects in the mass range 20@xmath10 .",
    "they describe the star s evolution from the hydrostatic phases of pre - main sequence contraction to the hydrogen burning main sequence phase through deuterium and lithium burning .",

    "the advent of the red - sensitive ccds and 2-dimensional near - ir detectors in the last decade has made it possible to detect such low - mass objects , and there have been numerous imaging surveys targeted towards open clusters to probe the substellar domain .",

    "we have used these two datasets in conjunction with the recent evolutionary models to isolate the low mass members of the clusters .",
    "the cluster membership is not ascertained by follow - up spectroscopy or proper motion studies .",
    "but the background / foreground contamination is accounted for statistically by studying nearby control fields . in  2 , we review some previous work on the derivation of the mass function ; in  3",

    "the stellar mass function is defined as the number density of stars per unit mass bin , and is universally represented as    @xmath15    the stellar imf for the high - mass stars ( @xmath16 ) has been long established and well studied following the pioneering work of salpeter ( 1955 ) .",
    "salpeter ( 1955 ) derived the imf from the luminosity function of the present day field stars assuming a constant rate of star formation and correcting for the stellar evolution . in linear units the salpeter mass function is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath13 = 2.35 for stars in the mass range 110 @xmath8 .",
    "the steep slope of the imf indicates that the low - mass stars greatly outnumber their high - mass counterparts and account for the major fraction of the stellar mass .",
    "miller & scalo ( 1979 ) and scalo ( 1986 ) rederived the stellar imf by extending the study to the subsolar domain .",
    "their derived values of @xmath13 are 1.4 , 2.5 and 3.3 for the mass ranges 0.1@xmath18 , 1.0@xmath19 and 10@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "there have been several studies recently to extend the stellar mass function to lower masses .",
    "kroupa et al ( 1993 ) took the age and metallicity dependence of the mass - luminosity relation into account in determining the mass functions .",
    "their derived values of @xmath13 are 2.7 for stars more massive than 1 m@xmath5 , 2.2 in the mass range @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the range @xmath23 .",
    "chabrier ( 2001 ) has derived the stellar mass function of the galactic disk stars down to the vicinity of the hbml using their luminosities determined from parallax measurements .",
    "his study indicates that the mass function may be slightly better represented by a log - normal or exponential form than the power - law form given by eq .",
    "his results suggest that the mass function flattens out below 1 m@xmath5 but keeps rising down to the bottom of the main sequence which is consistent with the results of kroupa et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "all these studies suggest a flattening of the imf at the low mass end . however , the nature of the mass function below the hbml , and particularly its spatial variation if any , is still poorly known . on the other hand , to understand the galactic structure , it is important to know the temporal and spatial variation of the imf .    according to the study by adams & fatuzzo ( 1996 )",
    ", the imf shows a low mass turn over and they attribute this turn over to the suppression of the very formation of low - mass objects by winds .",
    "models by price & podsiadlowski ( 1995 ) suggest that the stellar imf of a cluster should depend on the cluster density because of the stellar interactions during the process of accretion .",
    "whereas , larson ( 1992 ) links the dependence of the stellar imf on the geometrical structure of star forming clouds and in particular , he attributes the power law form of the upper imf to the presence of hierarchical or fractal structure in these clouds .",
    "the fragmentation of these filaments is predicted to yield a minimum stellar mass of @xmath24 .",
    "the searches for low - mass objects in young clusters by various groups mentioned in  1 have also found many hundreds of candidates with estimated masses below the hydrogen - burning limit of @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , some of these searches have also discovered free - floating objects with inferred masses possibly below the deuterium - burning limit of @xmath26 ( see , e.g. lucas & roche 2000 ; zapatero osorio et al .",
    "the scenarios proposed for the formation of such low - mass objects generally involve ejections from a multiple system .",
    "reipurth & clarke ( 2001 ) argue that brown dwarfs are not formed as a result of low mass core collapse but they are ejected stellar embryos from multiple systems for which the star formation process was aborted before the onset of hydrogen burning .",
    "this ejection model could appreciably explain the flattening of the imf at low masses .",
    "boss ( 2001 ) has suggested that , under certain conditions , the same collapse and fragmentation process that produce single and multiple stars can also produce planetary - mass , self - gravitating objects .",
    "the ejection of these fragments from an unstable , protostellar system may explain the formation of the free - floating planetary - mass objects found in some young clusters .",
    "reid et al . ( 1999 ) derive the mass function of the field stars using the 2mass and the denis data within 8 pc of the sun in the mass range 0.1  1 @xmath8 .",
    "their study shows that in the lower mass range the mass function is flatter ( @xmath27 ) , the value of @xmath13 being closer to the lower limit . extrapolating their results to the substellar regime down to 0.01 @xmath8",
    "they predict that the ratio of the number of brown dwarfs to the main sequence stars is 2:1 in the solar neighborhood .",
    "their study implies that brown dwarfs contribute less than 15% of the total mass of the disk and hence they are unlikely to be the major constituent of galactic dark matter .",
    "however , their mass function is necessarily derived from a mixed sample of stars formed at different times and different environments .    studying the stellar imf in different clusters",
    "provides a means to check whether the imf in clusters is different from that of the field population and also to check the universality of the imf .",
    "low mass objects can , in principle , escape a cluster due to cluster dynamics and galactic tides .",
    "in addition , the internal velocity dispersion may result in mass segregation in the cluster which is expected to increase with cluster age ( spitzer & mathieu 1980 ; kroupa 1995 ) .",
    "however , clusters younger than one relaxation time should not show these effects .",
    "mass segregation has been observed in very young ( @xmath28 1 myr ) clusters such as the orion trapezium ( hillenbrand & hartman 1997 ) , but these are most likely the result of the formation process rather than the dynamical evolution .",
    "the typical relaxation time of clusters like pleiades is @xmath7 10 myr ( raboud & mermilliod 1998 ) .",
    "hence , clusters with ages younger than @xmath7 10 myr would be ideal to understand the mass function at the low mass regime , as these clusters are not old enough to have lost members due to stellar evolution , or to have suffered mass segregation due to dynamical effects such as evaporation or violent relaxation ( lada & lada 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , young clusters are ideally suited for the detection of very low mass objects and brown dwarfs and hence for deriving the mass function in the substellar domain .",
    "this fact can be better appreciated in figure 1 which shows the @xmath29 magnitudes as a function of age and mass of the low - mass objects .",
    "the figure , which uses the models of baraffe et al .",
    "a larger set of model isochrones spanning a more extensive grid of ages and masses are available electronically via anonymous ftp from _ ftp.ens - lyon.fr_. ] and chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , shows that objects with masses less than 0.1 m@xmath5 are more than 5 magnitudes brighter when they are 1 myr old than when they are 1 gyr old , which makes them more easily detectable .",
    "the main objective of the present study is to derive the stellar mass function down to very low masses for a sample of young open clusters , in an attempt to obtain a global view of the mass function of low - mass objects in such young clusters .",
    "low mass stars ( @xmath30 ) have effective temperatures below 3500 k ( berriman & reid 1987 ) and brown dwarfs ( @xmath31 ) have temperatures below 2800 k ( chabrier et al . 2000 ) , which implies that the spectral energy distribution of these objects peaks in the near infrared between 1  3 @xmath32 m .",
    "hence , the near ir bands are ideal for detecting these objects .",
    "we use the data from the 2mass second incremental release and the latest version of the gsc catalogue .",
    "this 2mass release covers @xmath33 47% of the sky in @xmath34 near - ir bands .",
    "fortunately , it covers the major area of the three clusters and their corresponding control fields chosen by us .",
    "the incomplete coverage of our fields by the 2mass data is accounted for by appropriate normalization as explained in  5 . the latest version of the gsc catalog is an all - sky catalog of stars in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 bands with limiting magnitudes of 22 and 21 in each passband respectively .",
    "( currently , this catalog has restricted access , and is in its final stages of preparations for release , expected to be in late 2002 , mclean private communication ) .",
    "the red plates used in making the gsc catalogue had used slightly different emulsions for the northern and the southern surveys . accordingly , the f - passbands are slightly different for the northern and the southern sources , which we have taken into account in our analysis of the three clusters .",
    "the 2mass catalogue has roll over limiting magnitudes of 15 in @xmath37 , 15.5 in @xmath38 and 16.5 in @xmath39 ( the photometric accuracies are shown in fig . 7 of the documentation pages of the 2mass second incremental release ) .",
    "this allows us to probe low - mass objects down to about 0.03 @xmath40 of all nearby clusters ( d @xmath41 200pc ) with ages less than about 100 myr ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    unlike most other previous studies which rely on confirming the candidate low - mass objects through spectroscopic observations",
    ", we use a statististical approach to estimate the number of low - mass objects . in a statistical approach",
    ", it is important to use several control fields close to each cluster to subtract the contribution of foreground and background objects .",
    "the nature of these two extended surveys enables us to use several such control fields and we are not limited by our choice of the field sizes for the clusters or the control fields . to establish the viability of a statistical approach ,",
    "it is important to apply this procedure for a few well - studied clusters .",
    "the clusters we have chosen for this work are pleiades , ic 348 and @xmath0 orionis , all of which are young and nearby .",
    "the masses of the objects corresponding to the faint limiting magnitudes in each passband for the 3 clusters are given in table 1 .",
    "for ic 348 and @xmath0 orionis , a member with mass @xmath7 0.025 @xmath8 would have a @xmath42 magnitude @xmath7 15 and for the relatively older cluster pleiades , @xmath43 15 corresponds to objects with masses @xmath7 0.04 @xmath8 .",
    "pleiades and ic 348 have been well - studied through ground - based optical and near - ir photometry and optical spectroscopy , and hence it would be useful to check the consistency of our results with that of the previous studies .",
    "previous studies of @xmath0 orionis are confined to photometry in optical wavelengths , but our study includes the near ir data . a brief description of the individual clusters is given below .",
    "the details of the derivation of mass functions and comparison with other studies will be discussed in a later section .",
    "ic 348 is a relatively dense , rich and compact cluster at a distance of @xmath7310 pc , with a size @xmath7 20@xmath11 ( luhman 1999 ) and located in one end of the perseus molecular cloud .",

    "we merged the 2mass data with the gsc sources by taking the 2mass coordinates , and cross - correlating them with the gsc catalogue .",
    "for such a correlation , it is important to take an appropriate search radius which takes into account the uncertainty in the coordinates .",

    "a search radius of @xmath60 was found to be an optimum value for this cross - correlation , which was small enough to reject spurious and multiple detections which could be the result of diffraction spikes due to bright stars in the field , and large enough to include any positional uncertainties in the two catalogs .      assigning cluster membership to sources",
    "is a difficult task .",
    "the color magnitude diagrams [ cmds ] for various clusters given in the literature show that the density of faint members is usually comparable or even significantly less than the field / background / foreground population ( barrado y navascus et al.(2001a ) for ic 2391 , barrado y navascus et al.(2001c ) for m35 etc . )",
    "the use of cmds can be used as an effective tool to delineate possible members from the field contaminants .",
    "of course , proper motion and/or spectroscopic studies are needed to establish the membership of specific sources .",
    "the cmds best suited for this purpose can be determined by examining the locations of sources with different masses and temperatures in different cmds , and the slope and direction of the low - mass main sequence and the reddening vectors .",
    "an example @xmath42 versus @xmath61 cmd is shown in figure 3 where the dots represent the stars in the direction of the pleiades cluster . to differentiate the line - of - sight contaminants from the cluster members we need a reliable locus for the low - mass main sequence .",

    "we construct a @xmath62 locus for the young - disk objects using the empirical data from table 6 of leggett ( 1992 ) . the solid line in fig .",
    "3 shows such a disk sequence for all stars with spectral types m0 ( corresponding to 0.5 m@xmath5 ) and later as taken from leggett ( 1992 ) . here",
    ", we have appropriately shifted the leggett sequence to take the distance and the extinction of the pleiades cluster into account .",
    "the lowest two points in this line are identified as _ young - old _",
    "( y / o ) by leggett ( 1992 ) .",
    "we derive the reddening vectors from the interstellar extinction laws of rieke & lebofsky ( 1980 ) and bessell & brett ( 1988 ) ; these reddening vectors are shown as dashed lines in the fig .",
    "we have chosen to plot the young - disk population because such a plot is likely to be most useful in rejecting the older non - member stars along the line - of - sight which are expected to fall to the left of this sequence owing to metallicity effects .    as seen from the figure , the stars with spectral types m0 and later fall more or less vertical in this diagram , and the @xmath63 color changes by @xmath7 0.35 over this entire spectral range .",
    "the reddening vector runs almost perpendicular to this sequence with a slope of @xmath70.67 .",
    "since the effect of the distance is to move a particular source vertically in this diagram , there is a clear degeneracy between mass and distance for the mass range from 0.6 @xmath8 to @xmath7 0.06@xmath8 ( leggett 1992 ) . for lower masses ,",
    "the extinction vector runs almost parallel to the direction of the leggett sequence creating a degeneracy between mass and extinction in this spectral range .",
    "the inclusion of one optical color in the cmd [ e.g. @xmath36 versus @xmath64 overcomes the aforementioned degeneracies as explained below .",
    "one problem , however , is that the original data of leggett ( 1992 ) give the absolute magnitudes and the intrinsic colors for the standard broad band filters in the cousins , johnsons and the cit systems , and not in the f - passband .",
    "so we need to first convert the r magnitudes to f magnitudes by applying appropriate @xmath65 color corrections . for this purpose , we compared the leggett young disk sequence with model isochrones of different ages in a @xmath36 versus @xmath65 plot and found that the 100 myr reasonably fits the legett young disk sequence as expected ( e.g. allen 1973 ) .",
    "so we used the 100 myr model isochrones in f and r to calculate the values of @xmath65 , and applied this correction to the empirical @xmath47 values derived from leggett ( 1992 ) .",
    "the resulting cmd in @xmath36 versus @xmath65 is shown in fig.4 , where the color increases rapidly with spectral type ( @xmath7 3 mags ) and the reddening vector is steeper with a slope of @xmath71.59 .",
    "use of this plot avoids the degeneracies found in the @xmath62 cmd by minimizing the overlap between the reddened background stars and the low mass members of the cluster , and offers an efficient rejection criterion for non - members .",
    "hence we have used the @xmath36 vs. @xmath66 cmd to delineate field stars from the cluster members .",
    "figure 4 shows a clear separation between the cluster and non - cluster members , which justifies the use of this cmd .",
    "while rejecting the field star population , care has to be taken not to reject genuine candidates from the sample .",
    "the disk population in the spiral arms are the field contaminants in the line - of - sight .",
    "as will be shown later , the main sequence from leggett ( 1992 ) , corresponding to this young disk population , falls to the left of the theoretical isochrones from baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the clusters ic 348 and @xmath0 orionis .",
    "hence , this sequence from leggett ( 1992 ) is preferred over the other for the rejection criterion for these two clusters . for the pleiades cluster , which is @xmath7100myr old",
    ", the two tracks overlap for most of the masses but the baraffe model falls to the left for some part of the low mass sequence and hence is preferred over the leggett main sequence to reject non members , and at the same time to ensure that none of the genuine members are rejected . note that throughout the selection process , we have erred on the side of including some contaminants while ensuring that we do not reject _ any _ genuine low - mass objects .",
    "the price we pay in following this conservative approach is that our sample will inevitably include some foreground / background contamination .",
    "this is , however , a small price to pay since the contamination can be corrected through observations of the control fields . on the contrary , if some of the genuine objects are rejected , the effect can be disastrous since the observed number of stars would then be smaller than the actual number , thus making the statistics potentially incorrect .",
    "it is worth noting here that , since we have followed this conservative approach , the sources lying between the leggett main sequence and the theoretical isochrone should be treated with caution .    even though the @xmath36 vs. @xmath66 cmd is a better choice to separate the cluster members from the non - members ,",
    "we still see a smooth transition between the field stars and the cluster members in fig .",
    "4 which implies that our cluster sample would still be contaminated . this contamination could be due to the background reddened stars as well as the foreground population .",
    "we need to correct for this contamination before we can derive a reliable mass function .",
    "this becomes especially important in our study since we are not carrying out follow - up spectroscopic or proper motion studies to confirm the membership of individual members .",
    "as we will demonstrate in detail later , the contamination can be satisfactorily taken into account by studying the properties of off - fields or control fields in the vicinity of the clusters .",
    "we have tried to use several control fields , each covering the same area as the cluster , which are located near the cluster and are free from anomalies .",
    "these control fields were selected by visually inspecting the star density from the poss plates . for ic 348 ,",

    "we derive the value of interstellar reddening from the sample of 70 confirmed low mass cluster members of luhman ( 1999 ) .",
    "the observed distribution of the extinction values listed in luhman ( 1999 ) ranges from @xmath69 to @xmath70 with a peak around @xmath71=0.3 magnitudes .",
    "we have used the lower value of @xmath72 magnitudes in our selection criteria to ensure that none of the genuine cluster members are rejected .",

    "the observed stars would be expected to fall on both sides of this theoretical main sequence .",
    "thus , the fact that very few stars lie to the left of the main sequence implies that most of the extinction must be foreground rather than internal . on the other hand",

    "the region to the right of the redenning band is occupied by sources with infrared excess ( lada & lada 1995 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the discussion on the circumstellar extinction .    to derive the mass function , we construct mass bins of 0.01 @xmath8 in the mass range 0.02  0.09 @xmath8 .",

    "the number of sources in each mass bin is then normalized with the total number of sources detected in that field .",
    "this is essential in order to correct for the unequal area covered by the cluster and the control fields , often caused by incompleteness of the survey .",

    "( note that the contributions are not sensitive to the choice of the slope in the higher mass regime .",
    "for example , if we use the value of @xmath13 as 2.7 for m@xmath102 as derived by chabrier ( 2001 ) instead of the salpeter value of 2.35 , the mass contributions change only by @xmath103 ) .",
    "our results are consistent with that of the previous studies ( e.g. bjar et al .",

    "this is not surprising since the high - mass stars are likely to be preferentially lost in an older and mixed population such as the local sample .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the mass functions in the substellar regime of three young open clusters , ic 348 , @xmath0 orionis and pleiades , as derived using the data from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue which has a limiting magnitude of @xmath1 , and the latest version of the guide star catalogue ( gsc ) which has a limiting magnitude of @xmath2 21 . based on recent evolutionary models for low mass stars , </S>",
    "<S> we have formulated the selection criteria for stars with masses below @xmath3 . using a statistical approach to correct for the background contamination , we derive the mass function of objects with masses ranging from 0.5@xmath4 down to the substellar domain , well below the hydrogen burning mass limit . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest mass bins in our analysis are 0.025 , 0.045 and 0.055 m@xmath5 for ic 348 , @xmath0 orionis and pleiades , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant slopes of the mass functions are 0.8 @xmath6 0.2 for ic 348 , 1.2 @xmath6 0.2 for @xmath0 orionis and 0.5 @xmath6 0.2 for pleiades , which are consistent with the previous results . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of objects below 0.5 m@xmath5 to the total mass of the cluster is @xmath740% , and the contribution of objects below 0.08 m@xmath5 to the total mass is @xmath74% . </S>"
