    "the study of the cross - correlations between the faraday rotation and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature , was started in @xcite , and has showed itself to be of remarkable importance in the field of cmb science .",
    "+ the first , third , fifth and seventh year data releases from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite provide the most precise measurements of the cmb temperature distribution . the precision of these measurements will be significantly improved with the coming data from the ongoing planck mission . in order to be used for precision cosmology , the cmb data must be cleaned from the residuals of the galactic foreground . the focus for",
    "this cleaning has been the galactic plane , as this includes the most powerful contributions from the galaxy .",
    "however , in this article , we will investigate the possible foreground contamination at high and low galactic latitude .",
    "in particular , we will look at the effect that the interstellar medium ( ism ) , as well as nearby supernova remnants , might have on the cmb .",
    "+ the turbulent ism consist of hot ( @xmath1 ) low density ( @xmath2 ) ionized gas , filling about @xmath3 of the galactic volume and interspersed by cold neutral and relatively dense clouds with a high density of hi atoms ( @xmath4).these hi regions are the places for intensive star formation , which can turn the corresponding hi clouds into the short lived hii zones .",
    "the corresponding transition was observed in the blue compact galaxy henize 2 - 10 , by detection of a compact ( @xmath5 )  1 mjy radio sources @xcite .",
    "if similar hi - hii transitions occurs in the milky way , these clouds could manifest themselves in the cmb range of frequencies as a feature of the optical depth for the cmb photons , creating negative spots in the directions of the clouds , due to the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect .",
    "+ while the influence of the ism clouds on the cmb signal could have profound implication for the cmb - cosmology and the ism - science , this aspect of the problem attract very little attention in the literature .",
    "there is global mass balance by evaporation , ionization and condensation between supernova energy injection and radiative cooling in the ism ( see for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and corresponding references therein ) .",
    "+ additionally , the galactic sky contains several radio spurs , which can be joined together into loops .",
    "these are called the galactic radio loops , and since the 70s , six loops have been identified , commonly referred to , as loop i - vi ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "loop i - iv are designated as the main radio loops , and were discovered first @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , whereas loops v and vi , were only confirmed later @xcite .",
    "the origin for the radio loops are the quasi - spherical remnants of very old , nearby supernovae explosions , and the ensuing shock fronts ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the shock front contains an envelope of hi atoms , and violent mixing of warm and hot gasses takes place inside the shock area .",
    "the subsequent synchrotron emission from these supernova remnants ( snr ) , at the galactic radio loops may contribute to the cmb - radiation in form of the foreground residuals .",
    "we will investigate this , by analyzing correlations between the magnetic field strength and the cmb temperature , in the loop areas .",
    "+ the goal of our paper is to show that the hi - hii clouds can interfere with the cmb signal , and to investigate a possible connection between the galactic radio loops and the cmb temperature . to test these ideas we looked at the cross - correlations between a wmap temperature patch of the sky @xmath6 and the faraday rotation depth @xmath7 , using recently available data @xcite .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "first we introduce the concept of faraday depth , as well as our cross correlation coeffecient , for circular areas on the sky .",
    "then we introduce the two datasets that we use , the data for the faraday depth , and for the cmb , as well as our masking procedure . in the next section",
    "we construct the map of correlations , and present areas of extreme correlations , as well as investigate connections between faraday depth and cmb temperature extremes .",
    "we hereafter compare the correlation maps to simulations , analyzing the significance of our findings .",
    "we then turn to the specific area around the cold spot , and investigate the significance of the correlations in the area , using various tests .",
    "next , we start on the analysis of the loop areas in the sky , and look at the correlations there between cmb temperature and faraday depth , as well as between polarized data and faraday depth .",
    "finally , in the last section , we summmarize the paper , and draw our conclusions .",
    "the first test which we would like to implement , is the comparison of the cmb signal and the depth of the faraday rotation @xmath8 for various areas of the sky .",
    "historically , the cross - correlations of the cmb and the faraday rotation map was detected in @xcite for selected patches of the sky , mainly due to incompleteness of the last one . in a recent paper @xcite , the most extensive catalog of faraday rotation data of compact extragalactic polarized radio sources from the vla sky survey nvss @xcite , has been assembled .",
    "+ the authors @xcite introduce the concept of faraday depth , which depends on position and is independent of any astrophysical source .",
