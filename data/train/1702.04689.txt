    "in the last few decades , the fields of aerodynamics and aero - elasticity have bloomed significantly due to advances in computation power and experimentation . as a result ,",
    "the implementation of analytical methods has receded slightly . despite their limitations ,",
    "analytical techniques have contributed significantly in the development of the fields of aerodynamics and aero - elasticity .",
    "an important example is the pioneering work of theodorsen @xcite who derived closed form expressions of the aerodynamic loads on thin airfoils in incompressible flow using tools from complex analysis . despite the relative simplicity of the expressions derived by theodorsen",
    ", they have been intensively used by a significant number of researchers to study the aero - elastic stability and control of wing structures ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , researchers have used theodorsen s work as a basis to develop more accurate aerodynamic models ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it must to be noted that there were also other early works , prior to theodorsen work , that have considered analytical expressions of aerodynamic loads in subsonic flow such as @xcite .",
    "another important example is the relatively recent work of a.v .",
    "balakrishnan that has revived the interest in analytical techniques in aerodynamics and aero - elasticity ( see for example : @xcite ) and in particular the possio equation of aeroelasticity ( a generalization of the classical airfoil equation ) .",
    "balakrishnan has implemented functional analytic techniques intensively to derive and solve singular integral equations from which the aerodynamic loads on thin airfoils in compressible flows can be obtained . additionally , he studied the aero - elastic stability of wing structures using continuum models . besides the work of balakrishnan",
    ", there has been a series of recent mathematical works ( see for example : @xcite ) which have studied the mathematical aspects ( existence , uniqueness , obtaining solutions , and stability ) of different aerodynamic and aeroelastic problems . in conclusion , implementation of analytical techniques , despite their limitation and complexity , is significant in studying different aerodynamic and aeroelastic phenomena .",
    "ground effect is one of the aerodynamic phenomena that received attention from engineers and scientists for many years due to its significance in many applications @xcite .",
    "the ground effect is an aerodynamic phenomenon that can be observed when a flying object is near the ground as the induced lift on the flying object becomes relatively high compared to the lift induced in an open flow . in this paper , approximations of analytical formulas for the aerodynamic lift and moment on a thin airfoil near the ground",
    "are obtained .",
    "the formulas are obtained by first deriving a singular integral equation , also known as the possio equation @xcite .",
    "the integral equation is derived based on linearized compressible potential flow theory , typical section theory , fourier and laplace transforms , and theory of mikhlin multipliers @xcite .",
    "the solvability of the integral equation is then discussed for the steady state case and approximate solutions are then obtained for that case . finally , the divergence speed of a continuum wing structure in steady compressible flow near the ground is calculated based on the derived approximate solutions .",
    "in this work , subsonic flow over a thin airfoil that is located near the ground is considered .",
    "the aim of the study is to derive formulas from which the aerodynamic loads on the airfoil can be calculated .",
    "the airfoil is described by the set @xmath0 \\times \\ { z = z_{0 } \\ } \\subset \\mathbb{r}_{xz}^{+}$ ] at distance @xmath1 from the ground @xmath2 ( see figure ) , and is subject to an airflow with a free stream velocity of @xmath3 in the positive direction , so that @xmath4 signifies the trailing edge and @xmath5 is the leading edge of the chord .          the flow over the airfoil is assumed to be isentropic and following the behavior of ideal gases . additionally , the movement of the airfoil is assumed to be small compared to the free stream velocity .",
    "the flow is assumed to be two dimensional based on typical section theory which is valid for wings with high aspect ratios .",
    "accordingly , the flow over the airfoil is defined by a disturbance potential @xmath6 that satisfies the differential equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the free stream speed of sound and @xmath12 is the free stream mach number .",
    "note that the assumption of potential flow neglects the effects of the boundary layer which become significant when the airfoil is very close to the ground .",
    "therefore , the implementation of the theory discussed in this work is assumed to be valid when the airfoil is at an elevation range in which the boundary layer effects are small but the ground effect is still present .",
    "additionally , equation is valid for ranges of mach number between 0 and 0.7 @xcite . to calculate the pressure jump along the airfoil",
    ", a reasonable approximation in terms of the acceleration potential @xmath13 is used where @xmath14the pressure jump term @xmath15 is then defined by @xmath16where @xmath17 moreover , equation is supplemented with the following boundary conditions which describe zero normal velocity at the ground , matching normal flow - structure velocity on the airfoil ( flow tangency ) , zero pressure jump off the wing ( kutta -joukowski condition ) , zero pressure jump at the trailing edge of the airfoil ( kutta condition ) , and vanishing disturbance potential far from the airfoil .",

    "note that the kutta condition insures the uniqueness of solution to the problem under consideration as shall be discussed in the later sections .",
    "in this section , an equation that relates the pressure jump along the airfoil chord to the airfoil downwash , which is referred to as a possio equation , is derived .",
    "the derivation process starts with applying the laplace transform in the t variable and the fourier transform in the @xmath19 variable to both sides of equation ( [ eq : flow equation ] ) to obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . rearranging equation ( [ eq : transformed flow equation ] )",
    "results in @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the reduced frequency . since , @xmath27",
    ", it can be shown that the function @xmath28 is never @xmath29 .",
    "next , the method of images is used to account for the ground effect ( see figure  ) .",
    "the method assumes an open flow ( no ground ) and an image of the airfoil to be located at a distance @xmath30 from the ground axis .        due to the linearity of equation ,",
    "the solution of the flow problem is obtained by studying the open flow over the airfoil and its image separately .",
    "the separate solutions are given by @xmath31 the normal velocities about the axis @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 the solution to the flow problem should insure the continuity of the velocity field . therefore , @xmath34 .",
    "using the equations in and , the difference in @xmath35 and @xmath36 is expressed in terms of @xmath37 as    @xmath38    next , the fourier and the laplace transforms are applied to the acceleration potential in ( [ eq : acceleration potential ] ) and the pressure jump term in ( [ eq : pressure jump ] ) to obtain @xmath39 [ ] using equations and , the pressure jump term @xmath40 is represented in terms of the normal velocity @xmath37 as @xmath41 rearranging the above equation yields : @xmath42 equation   is the desired possio equation that relates the pressure jump to the normal velocity at @xmath43 in the fourier domain .",
    "the next step is to obtain an integral equation , based on equation , that relates the pressure jump along the airfoil to the airfoil downwash . to accomplish this , we appeal to the theory of mikhlin multipliers in the next section .",
    "in this section , the necessary definition and theory of mikhlin multipliers used in this work are presented .",
    "the readers are refereed to @xcite for detailed discussions and proofs .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath65 is a mikhlin multiplier .",

    "in particular , the function @xmath67 satisfies the estimate @xmath68 the term @xmath69 can be written as @xmath70 for a fixed value of @xmath71 , it can be verified , by calculations that are omitted in this paper , that    * @xmath72 is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath73 .",

    "based on the previous discussion , there exists a bounded linear operator @xmath78 corresponding to equation such that @xmath79 applying the projection operator @xmath80 $ ] to both sides of equation results in @xmath81 which is the possio equation that relates the pressure jump to the downwash .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of solution to equation depends on the properties of the operator @xmath82 . in the next section , the existence and uniqueness of solution to equation",
    "is discussed for the steady state case .",
