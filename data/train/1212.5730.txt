    "in graphene , scattering centers such as impurities , defects , adatoms , and substrate inhomogeneities greatly influence the local electronic properties.@xcite in some samples , the material quality is so high that a single or a few such scattering centers can influence the whole device .",
    "this may degrade device function , but can also be taken advantage of by making various sensing devices.@xcite great attention has therefore been focused on understanding the influence of scattering on the electronic properties of graphene.@xcite    in this context , the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) is becoming of increasing importance.@xcite by utilizing its various modes of operation , the stm can be used to map out topography , local density of states , local charge density , and more . in this way ,",
    "a variety of properties of graphene have been revealed . a few examples include perturbations in the local density of states around impurities@xcite or near step - edges in the substrate,@xcite charge puddle formation caused by molecules trapped between graphene flakes and the sio@xmath0 substrate,@xcite and resistance caused by steps@xcite in the substrate or multilayer regions@xcite in epitaxial graphene on silicon - carbide .    at the same time , encouraging progress has been achieved with fabrication of graphene nanostructures .",
    "top - down approaches include nano - lithography,@xcite scanning probe methods,@xcite etching with metal nanoparticles along certain crystal directions,@xcite and utilization of the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) to simultaneously image and sculpture graphene.@xcite a bottom up approach based on chemical synthesis has also been demonstrated.@xcite another approach involves unzipping of carbon nanotubes.@xcite with that method , the theoretically predicted zero - energy ( midgap ) edge states of nanoribbons with zigzag edges@xcite were directly mapped out by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts).@xcite theory also predicts that by controlling the width and edges of nanoribbons , a bandgap can be opened up at the dirac point through quantum confinement ( see the review ) . with further progress it may soon become possible to study in much greater detail the interplay between quantum confinement and impurity scattering in graphene nanoribbons .",
    "many theoretical studies of graphene nanoribbons have been reported in the literature , see the collection of review articles in ref .  .",

    "this study generalizes the consideration of ft - ldos of a single impurity in bulk graphene@xcite to the case of nanoribbons .",
    "we focus the analytic analysis on armchair ribbons in the dirac approximation ( linearization around the k - points in the graphene bandstructure ) , for which the wavefunctions and propagators for clean ribbons are known , and solve the impurity problem in a t - matrix formulation .",
    "thereby we obtain the electron propagator for an armchair nanoribbon including the effects of a local scattering center .",
    "the fourier transformed density of states ( ft - ldos ) is then obtained and explained in terms of scattering processes of dirac quasiparticles confined in the ribbon .",
    "we extend the analysis to an atomistic tight - binding model of graphene , utilizing a numerical recursive green s function approach .",
    "the main effect of going beyond the dirac approximation is trigonal warping , which shows up as a triangular distorsion of the ft - ldos patterns .    for comparison",
    "we include an analysis of the ft - ldos in a quantum ribbon in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "many features of the ft - ldos patterns in graphene ribbons can be understood from the somewhat simpler case of a 2deg , and the new features special for graphene can be highlighted .",
    "these include a more complicated bandstructure due to the two inequivalent k - points , trigonal warping , as well as interference effects due to the bipartite lattice of graphene .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section  [ ch_ftsts ]",
    "we discuss the fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy method and illustrate the basic scattering processes at play in a nanoribbon . in section  [ ch_2deg ]",
    "we present results for the ft - ldos in a 2deg quantum channel .",
    "in section  [ ch_armchair ] we report our results for the ft - ldos in an armchair graphene nanoribbon within the dirac approximation and compare with the 2deg case . in section  [ ch_numerics ]",
    "we present results of numerical simulations of a tight - binding model , including also zigzag nanoribbons as well as effects of edge disorder on the ft - ldos . in section [ ch_summary ]",
