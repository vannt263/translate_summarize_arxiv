    "this is the second lecture on dimensional continuation , a new technique  @xcite recently used to calculate the charged particle stopping power and the temperature equilibration rate in a weakly to moderately coupled plasma  @xcite . in lecture",

    "reference  @xcite also contains a summary of the method in a very readable form . in this lecture",
    ", i will present the complete calculation of the electron - ion temperature equilibration rate in the _ extreme _ quantum limit , valid to leading and next - to - leading order in the number density ( a more general calculation is performed in section  12 of ref .",
    "@xcite to _ all _ orders in quantum mechanics , thereby providing an exact interpolation between the extreme classical and quantum limits ) .",
    "this calculation is near exact for a weakly coupled plasma , and it is quite accurate for a moderately coupled plasma . before proceeding directly to the calculation , however , it might be useful to quickly review some of the more salient features of dimensional continuation discussed in lecture  i.    under most circumstances , a plasma is not produced in thermal equilibrium ; for example , when a laser ionizes a substance , it preferentially heats the electrons over the ions .",
    "however , since the electrons are so light , they rapidly come into thermal equilibrium among themselves with temperature @xmath10 ; some time later , the ions too will equilibrate among themselves to a common temperature @xmath11 .",
    "finally , the electrons and ions will begin to equilibrate , and it is this process upon which we shall focus .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the rate per unit volume at which the electron system at temperature @xmath10 exchanges energy with the ion system at temperature @xmath11 through coulomb interactions ( throughout these notes , i will always measure temperature in energy units ) .",
    "the electron - ion equilibration rate is proportional to the temperature difference between the electrons and ions , and can be expressed by @xmath13 to restate the goal of this lecture more precisely , we shall calculate @xmath14 in the high temperature limit [ where two - body scattering is accurately given by the born approximation ] , and we will do so _ exactly _ to leading and next - to - leading order in the plasma coupling parameter @xmath4 [ defined in lecture  i , or in eq .",

    "reference  @xcite , hereafter referred to as bps , used a double pronged strategy to calculate the rate coefficient ( [ bpsrate ] ) .",
    "first , a well chosen  @xcite dimensionless parameter @xmath4 was constructed from the relevant dimensionfull plasma quantities , thereby providing a parameter in which to perform a _ controlled _ perturbative expansion to leading and next - to - leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "the systematic error of the calculation was estimated by the cubic order term in the expansion , which is quite small for a weakly to moderately coupled plasma .",
    "while perturbative calculations are not very common in plasma physics , primarily because of the complexity of the systems of interest and the computational focus within the field , the validity of perturbation theory should nonetheless be clear for a `` simple '' system such as a weakly coupled and fully ionized plasma .",
    "the second part of the bps argument deployed a powerful technique from quantum field theory allowing one to _ analytically _ calculate the coefficients in the @xmath4-expansion .",
    "let us first concentrate on the perturbative expansion . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discussed at length in lecture  i  @xcite , for the case at hand the dimensionless plasma coupling parameter is defined by , with @xmath36 . ]",
    "@xmath37 note that @xmath4 is the ratio of the coulomb potential energy of two point - charges , separated by the screening length @xmath38 , to the thermal energy of the plasma .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 can be used to measure the strength of the plasma . to get a feel for the size of @xmath4 in a hot but not too dense plasma",
    ", one finds @xmath39 for a hydrogen plasma under the conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "one can scale to other density and temperature regimes by noting that @xmath42 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that plasma quantities always expand in _ integer _ powers of the coupling @xmath4 , and therefore @xmath4 is the appropriate parameter in which to perform a controlled perturbative analysis for weakly coupled plasmas .",
    "is related to the expansion parameter by @xmath43 ( with proportionality constant of order unity ) .",
    "small values of @xmath44 therefore imply small values of @xmath4 , and one may characterize the _ strength _ of the plasma by either @xmath4 or @xmath44 .",
    "the proportionality relation above follows from the fact that @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( the parameter @xmath4 is defined in terms of a debye screening length @xmath38 , while @xmath44 is defined in terms of the inter - particle spacing @xmath47 ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath48 , we may loosely think of the @xmath4-expansion as an expansion in the electron number density , as i have done in the first paragraph of this introduction .",
    "more precisely , of course , we are expanding in the dimensionless quantity @xmath49 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details , particularly section  1.1 entitled _ relevant scales and dimensionless parameters_. ] the allows for possible non - analytic terms , such as @xmath50 , and in particular , the electron - ion equilibration rate can be written @xmath51 where i have indicated the leading order ( lo ) and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) terms in the expansion .",
    "the minus sign on the leading order term of ( [ dedtnlo ] ) is a matter of convention , and for small values of @xmath4 it renders the coefficient @xmath1 positive when the energy exchange is positive .",
    "provided we can calculate the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then ( [ dedtnlo ] ) will be quite accurate in a weakly to moderately coupled plasma in which @xmath4 is small .",
    "of course this perturbative approach breaks down for strongly coupled plasmas , those for which the value of @xmath4 is of order one or greater , since every term in the expansion becomes equally important in such cases .",
    "however , unlike a model or an uncontrolled calculation , the bps calculation informs us of its domain of validity , and it provides an estimate of its own error through the size of @xmath4 .",
    "we have now reduced the problem to finding the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the rate ( [ dedtnlo ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath1 was first obtained long ago by spitzer  @xcite  ( and it can be estimated by dimensional analysis alone ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath2 , however , was calculated only recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , which employed a powerful technique from quantum field theory called dimensional regularization , or dimensional continuation as i will call it here .",
    "since this technique is quite subtle and has proven to be somewhat controversial , i should emphasize that the method by which one _ chooses _ to calculate these coefficients is immaterial , except to the extent that it must contain enough physics to extract the next - to - leading order coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "techniques other than dimensional continuation could well furnish one with the correct expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and perhaps in a simpler manner .",
    "however , the only relevant point here is that   we must analytically calculate these coefficients , and dimensional continuation is one method of doing this . ) in the limit of weak coupling .",
    "as far as i am aware , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are the only works currently in the literature with a formalism strong enough to extract such next - to - leading order physics from first principles . ]    before turning to the calculation of the coefficients , allow me to make a comment on the relation between the next - to - leading order @xmath2-term and the coulomb logarithm .",
    "writing the leading order coefficient as @xmath52 , and defining the dimensionless coefficient @xmath53 , we can express the rate ( [ dedtnlo ] ) in the form @xmath54 since the coulomb logarithm means different things to different people , i would like to be quite specific in this lecture . by the words `` coulomb logarithm '' i simply mean the term @xmath55 defined in ( [ lngsqu ] ) , excluding the cubic and higher order terms .",
    "hence , calculating the next - to - leading order coefficient @xmath2 is equivalent to determining the dimensionless coefficient @xmath56 _ inside _ the coulomb logarithm .",
    "finding dimensionless constants is usually a difficult problem , particularly since one can not appeal to dimensional analysis for an estimate .",
    "it should therefore not be surprising that the coefficient @xmath56 varies over an order of magnitude or so across the various models within the literature .",
    "before proceeding directly to the calculation in sec .  [",
    "sec : calmain ] , let us further develop the basic physics and mathematical machinery necessary to perform calculations in an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "the motivation for this section is , of course , a thorough exposition of the bps methodology for calculating coulomb energy - loss processes in a plasma .",
    "however , the material in this section is well known and applicable to a wide variety of other calculations , such as particle decay rates in high energy physics and analytic work in statistical mechanics . for the sake of completeness , however , and to establish some results that will be useful in sec .",
    "[ sec : calmain ] , i will present a cursory but self - contained treatment here .",
    "if this material is familiar , then one may proceed directly to the calculation of the temperature equilibration rate in sec .",
    "[ sec : calmain ] ( given the background material in this section , the calculation itself is less than eight pages in length ) .",
    "we shall start by developing the hyperspherical coordinate system in @xmath57 dimensions , which is a straightforward generalization of three dimensional spherical coordinates . to illustrate the utility of hyperspherical coordinates",
    ", i will calculate the hyperarea and hypervolume of several multidimensional objects by exploiting their spherical and cylindrical symmetries .",
    "these results will be used quite extensively in the next section . as a physical application ,",
    "i then develop the multidimensional analog of the scattering cross section , which will allow us to consistently include short - distance quantum scattering effects in the @xmath4-expansion ( quantum effects manifest themselves through the @xmath58-dependence of the coefficients in this expansion ) .",
    "since we are interested in coulomb energy exchange , we next examine electrostatics in arbitrary dimensions . from the multidimensional form of gauss law",
    ", we shall derive the @xmath57-dimensional coulomb potential @xmath59 , and we will see that it depends only upon @xmath60 in such a way as to emphasizes short distance physics when @xmath61 and long distance physics when @xmath62 . in @xmath63 ,",
    "the short and long distance physics compete with equal strength , giving an infrared and an ultraviolet divergence , and this is what renders the temperature equilibration problem so difficult . to employ the extreme quantum limit , in which the born approximation for the two - body scattering dominates , we must calculate the fourier transform of the coulomb potential in @xmath57 dimensions .",
    "interestingly , we shall find that the fourier transform of @xmath64 is given by the quite simple expression @xmath65 , the form of which does not depend upon the dimension of space , but only upon the length of the wavenumber @xmath66 .",
    "the fact that @xmath67 is so simple greatly facilitates calculations in the extreme quantum limit . with potential in hand",
    ", we shall then construct kinetic equations in @xmath57 dimensions .",
    "these equations are explicitly finite in all but @xmath63 dimensions , and i will explain the manner by which the bbgky hierarchy reduces to the boltzmann equation and the lenard - balescu equation ( in @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively ) .",
    "kinematic quantities such as the @xmath57-dimensional momentum or position vectors are elements of the same @xmath57-dimensional euclidean space @xmath68 . for definiteness , i will specialize to the case of position @xmath69 , with the understanding that this vector could also refer to momentum or wavenumber .",
    "we can decompose any vector @xmath70 in terms of a rectilinear orthonormal basis @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 , or in component notation @xmath73 .",
    "each component is given by @xmath74 , and a change @xmath75 in the vector @xmath69 corresponds to a change @xmath76 in the rectilinear coordinate @xmath77 . letting @xmath69 vary successively along the independent directions @xmath71",
    ", we can trace out a small @xmath57-dimensional hypercube with sides of length @xmath78 ; therefore , the rectilinear volume element is given by the simple form @xmath79 in performing integrals over the kinematic variables , however , symmetry usually dictates the use of hyperspherical coordinates rather than rectilinear coordinates .",
    "i will therefore review",
    "the hyperspherical coordinate system in this subsection , deriving the measure for a volume element @xmath80 in terms of hyperspherical coordinates . for our purposes , the primary utility of hyperspherical coordinates is that the volume element @xmath80 can be written as a product of certain conveniently chosen dimensionless angles , which i will collectively refer to as @xmath81 , and an overall dimensionfull radial factor @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 .",
    "starting with the usual spherical coordinates of fig .",
    "[ fig : coord1 ] , let us recall why the three dimensional volume element takes the form @xmath84 ( with and , and of course @xmath85 ; the coordinate singularities of the spherical system are not important here ) .",

    "the two angles @xmath86 and @xmath87 specify completely the direction of the unit vector @xmath89 . as we increase the polar angle @xmath86 by a small amount @xmath90 , the vector @xmath69 sweeps out an arc of length @xmath91 ; similarly , a change @xmath92 in the azimuthal angle will cause @xmath93 to sweep out a perpendicular arc ( in the @xmath88-@xmath94 plane ) of length @xmath95",
    ". note that the factor of @xmath96 in @xmath97 arises from the projection of @xmath69 onto the @xmath88-@xmath94 plane .",
    "we can make one more independent displacement by moving @xmath98 units in the radial direction , which results in a line of length @xmath99 . for small displacements in @xmath90 , @xmath92 , and @xmath98 ,",

    "<S> i develop the framework further , and then explicitly calculate the electron - ion temperature equilibration rate in the high temperature limit . in this extreme quantum limit , the calculation of the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 simplifies considerably , allowing us to concentrate on the physics of the method rather than the added complexity of the more general bps calculation . </S>",

    "<S> should higher order contributions be required , they can be calculated systematically , thereby improving the accuracy of the result in a controlled manner . to get a feel for the numbers , one finds @xmath6 at the center of the sun , where the plasma conditions are @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
