    "the hamiltonian road to quantization has played a key role , over the last century , in the development of quantum mechanics @xcite , quantum field theory in flat spacetime @xcite , including quantum yang - mills @xcite and the particle physics standard model , as well as in the formulation of canonical quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of the hamiltonian formulation , despite its beautiful and powerful applications to the classical cauchy problem of general relativity @xcite , lies in the loss of the full diffeomorphism group of four - dimensional spacetime , with the associated undoing of the unification of space and time into the spacetime manifold ( see , however , the valuable work in refs .",

    "even earlier , at quantum level , the work of peierls @xcite and dewitt @xcite made it possible to define a poisson bracket on the space of all field functionals that remain invariant under the action of the infinite - dimensional lie ( pseudo-)group of the theory ( for gravity , this is the group of spacetime diffeomorphisms ) .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are any two such functionals of the field variables @xmath2 , their classical peierls bracket reads as ( see appendix for the notation ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 , the supercommutator function @xcite , is the difference between advanced and retarded green functions for the invertible operator @xmath5 acting on fields : @xmath6 the advanced and retarded green functions are both left- and right - inverses of @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath7 @xmath8    in the framework of ref .",

    "let us consider , for simplicity , a scalar differential operator @xmath36 with @xmath37 coefficients @xmath38 that is defined on a connected open set @xmath39 of four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "a _ fundamental solution _ of @xmath36 is a distribution @xmath40 which is a function of the spacetime point @xmath41 such that @xmath42 this means that @xcite @xmath43 we note that the fundamental solution is not uniquely defined , unlike the case of green s functions @xcite , for each of which there is a specific boundary condition .",
    "a @xmath37 _ parametrix _ of @xmath36 is instead a distribution @xmath44 such that @xcite @xmath45 this concept is of interest because , although a fundamental solution is a useful tool for solving linear partial differential equations , some of the problems in which it plays a role can be handled better by means of functions possessing a singularity that is not annihilated but merely smoothed out by the differential operator under investigation .",
    "the smoothing might even be so weak that the singularity is actually augmented but acquires a less rapid growth than was to be anticipated from the order of the differential operator @xcite .    if one studies the scalar wave equation on minkowski spacetime in the coordinates @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , the solution of the cauchy problem @xmath48 can be expressed in the form @xmath49 where , on denoting by @xmath50 the fourier transforms of cauchy data , the operators @xmath51 act @xcite in such a way that ( here @xmath52 ) @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are real - valued _ phase functions _ which satisfy the initial condition @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a regularizing operator ( see our earlier comments ) which smoothes out the singularities acted upon by it @xcite .",
    "thus , the amplitudes @xmath57 and phases @xmath54 make it possible to build the parametrix for the cauchy problem . in our analysis",
    "we are going to need the generalization of this construction to the tensor wave equation , bearing in mind that eq .",
    "( 1.14 ) is the tensor version of eq .",
    ".    meanwhile , let us try to develop a heuristic argument on the relation between a fundamental solution @xmath58 and a @xmath37 parametrix @xmath59 of a partial differential operator @xmath36 as in ( 2.1 ) . by omitting , for simplicity of notation , the subscript @xmath41 ,",
    "if we consider the split @xmath60 we find @xmath61 thus , a fundamental solution of @xmath36 differs from its @xmath37 parametrix by minus the inverse of @xmath36 applied to the regularizing term @xmath62 . in the simplest case , i.e. operators on the real line , we would therefore solve the inhomogeneous equation @xmath63 in the form @xmath64 now , to the extent that the parametrix leads to a good approximate inverse of @xmath36 , the integral @xmath65 on the right - hand side of ( 2.11 ) provides a good approximation of @xmath66 similarly , in the tensor wave equations which are the ultimate goal of our investigation , with the associated peierls bracket , we are going to re - express ( 1.1 ) as the sum of the parametrix and remainder contribution , respectively .",
    "the difference between fundamental solution and parametrix is further elucidated , with the notation summarized in appendix b , by sections 4.2 and 4.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which prove that there exist fundamental solutions of the operator @xmath36 having the form ( see ( b1)-(b6 ) ) @xmath67 as well as parametrices reading as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a smooth function belonging to @xmath70 , expressible , for which @xmath71 , while the world function @xmath72 takes the form @xmath73 . ] by @xmath74 the @xmath75 being the covariant components of the vector @xmath76 in ( 2.1 ) , while @xmath77 solves the characteristic initial value problem @xmath78 and is real - analytic , hence expressible as @xmath79 the @xmath80 being elements of @xmath70 computable in the form @xmath81 while @xmath82 where @xmath83 and takes values @xmath84 the @xmath85 being a sequence of positive numbers , strictly increasing and tending to infinity . by virtue of ( 2.12)-(2.18 ) , one finds ( cf .",

    "we know that there are infinitely many @xmath37 parametrices of @xmath36 supported in the causal future of @xmath41 , and the previous theorem shows that one can construct a fundamental solution @xmath96 from any one of these .",

    "@xcite , which is precisely the advanced green function needed in the construction of the peierls bracket .",

    "more precisely , in the quantum commutator ( 1.15 ) for gravity , the factors on the right - hand side do not commute .",

    "<S> in the sixties , dewitt discovered that the advanced and retarded green functions of the wave operator on metric perturbations in the de donder gauge make it possible to define classical poisson brackets on the space of functionals that are invariant under the action of the full diffeomorphism group of spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> he therefore tried to exploit this property to define invariant commutators for the quantized gravitational field , but the operator counterpart of such classical poisson brackets turned out to be a hard task . on the other hand , in the mathematical literature , it is by now clear that , rather than inverting exactly an hyperbolic ( or elliptic ) operator , it is more convenient to build a quasi - inverse , i.e. an inverse operator up to an operator of lower order which plays the role of regularizing operator . </S>",
    "<S> this approximate inverse , the parametrix , which is , strictly , a distribution , makes it possible to solve inhomogeneous hyperbolic ( or elliptic ) equations . </S>",
    "<S> we here suggest that such a construction might be exploited in canonical quantum gravity provided one understands what is the counterpart of classical smoothing operators in the quantization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the simplest case , i.e. fundamental solution and parametrix for the linear , scalar wave operator ; the next step are tensor wave equations , again for linear theory , e.g. maxwell theory in curved spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> last , the nonlinear einstein equations are studied , relying upon the well - established choquet - bruhat construction , according to which the fifth derivatives of solutions of a nonlinear hyperbolic system solve a linear hyperbolic system . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is solved by means of kirchhoff - type formulas , while the former fifth - order equations can be solved by means of well - established parametrix techniques for elliptic operators . </S>",
    "<S> but then the metric components that solve the vacuum einstein equations can be obtained by convolution of such a parametrix with kirchhoff - type formulas . some basic functional equations for the parametrix </S>",
    "<S> are also obtained , that help in studying classical and quantum version of the jacobi identity . </S>"
