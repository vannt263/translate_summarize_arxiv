    "special functions are of primary importance to the study of physics .",
    "they appear in physics as solutions to various differential equations describing many different kinds of physical systems .",
    "in fact , one can not study quantum mechanics without being exposed to many different special functions .",
    "hermite polynomials , e.g. , appear in the solution to the quantum harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "bessel functions and legendre polynomials appear when solving the schrdinger equation in spherical coordinates .",
    "the laguerre polynomials appear when studying the hydrogen atom . despite the differences between the types of special functions that exist , they all share similar properties .",
    "special functions are orthogonal , satisfy various differential and recursion relations , have generating functions , and are solutions to certain second order differential equations .",
    "these properties were originally discovered during the 19th century by mathematicians doing classical analysis .",
    "but during the middle of the 20th century , mathematicians found a relationship between the special functions and lie groups .",
    "this breakthrough allowed for a deeper understanding of the origin of the various properties of the special functions .",
    "lie groups are continuous groups with differentiable composition and inversion maps .",
    "physicists are most familiar with lie groups having matrix representations , particularly in particle physics , e.g. , @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "it was discovered that many of the special functions are matrix elements of matrix representations of different lie groups .",
    "many of the special functions also appear as basis functions of differential operator representations of lie algebras .",
    "a lie algebra can be constructed from a lie group by linearizing the group in the neighborhood of the identity .",
    "the resulting lie algebra is a linear vector space satisfying certain properties . rather than work directly with a lie group ,",
    "it is often easier to consider its corresponding lie algebra instead .",
    "the connection between lie algebras and special functions had its beginnings in a 1951 paper by the mathematicians infeld and hull @xcite .",
    "building on the efforts of physicists paul dirac and erwin schrdinger , who introduced a technique in quantum mechanics called the factorization method , infeld and hull discovered a way to factorize a large class of second order differential equations into pairs of first order differential operators .",
    "this discovery provided an alternative way to derive recursion relations of the solutions to the differential equations .",
    "the equations they considered included many of the special function equations , such as hermite s equation and bessel s equation . in the early 1960s , other mathematicians , including an american mathematician named willard miller @xcite , were able to demonstrate that the first order differential operators that appear as factors in infeld and hull s paper are elements of lie algebras .",
    "the special functions and their properties could then be viewed as having their origin in the theory of lie algebras and representation theory .",

    "three monographs on the subject were published .",
    "miller published a book called  lie theory and special functions , \" which expanded on his earlier work @xcite .",
    "james talman published a book for physicists called  special functions : a group theoretic approach \" which was based on lectures given by the physicist eugene wigner @xcite .",
    "finally , the russian mathematician n. vilenkin published the book  special functions and the theory of group representations \" ( written in 1965 ; translated into english in 1968 ) @xcite . while the focus in miller s book is still partly on the factorization method and the relationship between special functions and representations of lie algebras , all three of these books explore the relationship between special functions and representations of lie groups .",
    "despite the fact that undergraduate physics curriculum exposes students to some of the special functions and their properties , the connection between lie theory and special functions is not taught . not only that , but many undergraduate physics students have no knowledge of what a lie group even is .",
    "this is unfortunate because , particularly in quantum mechanics , for example , there are lie groups and lie algebras present behind the scenes of many of the systems studied .",
    "a knowledge of this connection would help students appreciate a deeper sense of some of the common problems in quantum mechanics , such as the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "on the other hand , the connection between special functions and lie theory is an abstract subject requiring knowledge of advanced mathematics in order to grasp the basic ideas .",
    "much of the existing literature on the subject remains inaccessible to undergraduate students .",
    "the purpose of this thesis is to bridge this divide and to make the subject relevant to undergraduate students who have studied quantum mechanics and are comfortable with bra - ket notation .",
    "the necessary mathematical background is presented in chapter [ ch : background ] . in chapter",
    "[ ch : hermite polynomials ] , the relationship between the heisenberg algebra and the hermite polynomials is explored .",
    "the methods presented in chapter [ ch : hermite polynomials ] are then applied in chapter [ ch : bessel functions ] to study the relationship between the algebra of the euclidean group in the plane and the bessel functions .",
    "before one can begin to understand what a lie group is , it is necessary to define the mathematical structure known as a _",

    "that associativity can not be deduced from axioms @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and so it must be taken as an axiom . there",
    "exist many examples of non - associative binary operations .",
    "subtraction is non - associative , for example , as is division and exponentiation .",
    "groups are very common structures in mathematics .",
    "simple examples include the set of integers under addition @xmath19 , the set of real numbers excluding zero under multiplication @xmath20 , and the set of complex @xmath21 invertible matrices under matrix multiplication @xmath22 .",
    "if the binary operation of a group is clear , we often drop the operator symbol and write @xmath23 in place of @xmath24",
    ". the number of elements in a group ( called its order ) can be finite or infinite .",
    "it is often convenient to parametrize the elements of the group using another set .",
    "a parametrization of a group is essentially a method of labeling the elements of the group .",
    "if we write the group elements in the form @xmath25 or @xmath26 with @xmath27 , then the indices @xmath28 serve as a label of the group . labeling the elements of a group with positive integers , however does not work for all groups . if the order of a group is uncountably infinite , for example , then we must use another set ( such as @xmath29 ) to parametrize the group elements .",
    "once we have parametrized the elements of a group @xmath8 by a set @xmath30 , we can view the group operation @xmath9 as a function @xmath31 from the direct product @xmath32 to @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , we can view the inversion property of the group @xmath34 with @xmath35 as a function @xmath36 . as an example of this ,",
    "if @xmath37 is a parametrization of @xmath8 , then group operations take the form @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "this is equivalent to writing @xmath40 , so here we have @xmath41 .",

    "a group @xmath7 parametrized by an n - dimensional manifold @xmath44 is a * lie group * if its composition map @xmath46 and inversion map @xmath47 are differentiable .",
    "an example of a lie group relevant to this discussion is the _ heisenberg group _ , or @xmath2 .",
    "this group has a @xmath48 matrix representation given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath31 and @xmath45 are differentiable maps , and so @xmath2 is indeed a lie group .",
    "for example , if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 and so @xmath53 which is clearly differentiable in the group parameters .",
    "it can similarly be shown that the inversion map @xmath54 is also differentiable .",
    "it is important to note that the composition and inversion maps are what define a lie group , not a particular representation .",
    "the heisenberg group , for instance , is not defined by ( [ h_3 group matrix rep ] ) . for a given lie group ,",
    "there are infinitely many ways to represent it .",
    "we will discuss the subject of representation theory in section [ section rep theory ] .",
    "whereas lie groups are a special kind of group , lie algebras are a special kind of linear vector space .",
    "lie algebras are closely related to lie groups , in that when you linearize a lie group in the neighborhood of its identity , you obtain a lie algebra .",
    "conversely , when you exponentiate each element of a lie algebra , you obtain elements of the lie group .",
