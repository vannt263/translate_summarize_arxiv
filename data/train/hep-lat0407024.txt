    "there are many computational and analytical evidences pointing towards the ` triviality ' of @xmath9 theories in @xmath10 dimensions  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) , though a rigorous proof is still lacking .",
    "nevertheless these theories continue to be useful and play an important role for unified model of electroweak interactions .",
    "the conventional interpretation of these theories extends to any number n of scalar field components and , when used in the standard model , leads to predict a proportionality relation , @xmath11 , between the squared higgs boson mass @xmath12 and the square of the known weak scale @xmath13 ( 246 gev ) through the renormalized scalar self - coupling @xmath14 , @xmath2 being the ultraviolet cutoff . in this picture , the ratio @xmath15 is a cutoff - dependent quantity that becomes smaller and smaller when @xmath2 is made larger and larger .    by accepting the validity of this picture",
    ", there are important phenomenological implications .",
    "for instance , a precise measurement of @xmath16 , say @xmath17 gev , would constrain the possible values of @xmath2 to be smaller than about 2 tev thus suggesting the occurrence of ` new physics ' at that energy scale .    in an alternative approach   @xcite , however , this conclusion is not true .",
    "the crucial point is that the ` higgs condensate ' and its quantum fluctuations undergo different rescalings when changing the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "therefore , the relation between @xmath16 and the physical @xmath13 is not the same as in perturbation theory .    in order to remind the basic issue",
    "let us preliminarily observe that in a broken - symmetry phase the conventional field rescaling can not be viewed as an ` operatorial statement ' between bare and renormalized fields of the type , say @xmath18 in fact @xcite this relation is a consistent short - hand notation in a theory allowing an asymptotic fock representation , as in qed .",
    "however , in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking it has no rigorous basis since the fock representation exists only for the _ shifted _ fluctuating field .",
    "for this reason , it is the residue of the shifted - field propagator , say @xmath19 , that through the kllen - lehmann representation is related to the normalization of the single - particle states . in principle",
    ", this quantity is quite unrelated to @xmath0 the rescaling of the vacuum field ( the scalar ` condensate ' ) which is defined through the physical mass and the zero - momentum susceptibility and is by no means constrained to be below unity .    to be definite , let us consider a one - component scalar theory and introduce the bare expectation value @xmath20 associated with the ` lattice ' field as defined at a locality scale fixed by the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "connecting to the stability analysis , such expectation value represents one of the absolute minima , say @xmath21 , of the effective potential @xmath22 of the theory .",
    "now , by @xmath0 we denote the rescaling that is needed to obtain the physical vacuum field @xmath23 by _ physical _ , we mean that the second derivative of the effective potential @xmath24 parameterized in terms of the physical field and evaluated at @xmath25 , is precisely given by @xmath26 .",
    "since the second derivative of the effective potential @xmath27 is the bare zero - four - momentum two - point function ( the inverse zero - momentum susceptibility ) , this standard definition is equivalent to define @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the bare zero - momentum susceptibility .",
    "notice that there is nothing in the above derivation that dictates @xmath31 .",
    "on the other hand , assuming the kllen - lehmann representation for the shifted fluctuating field , that has a vanishing expectation value and admits a particle interpretation , one predicts @xmath32 , with ` triviality ' implying @xmath33 when approaching the continuum theory .",
    "therefore , although in the standard approach one assumes @xmath34 , up to small perturbative corrections , one should remind the basically different operative definitions of the two z s .    for this reason , a different interpretation of triviality",
    "was proposed ( see refs.@xcite and some elder works quoted therein ) starting from the observations that ` triviality ' does not require the effective potential to be a trivially quadratic function of @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the theory can be ` trivial ' , in a technical sense , but non - trivial in a physical sense and the two things can coexist provided all interaction effects can be re - absorbed , in the continuum limit , into the vacuum structure and the physical mass of a massive free field .",
    "this requirement leads to consider a _",
    "class _ of approximations to the effective potential , say @xmath36 , where the shifted fluctuating field is governed by an effective quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "this includes the one - loop potential , the gaussian approximation and the infinite set of post - gaussian calculations where the effective potential reduces to the sum of a classical background energy and of the zero - point energy of a massive free field , as at one loop . in this class of approximations ,",
    "one finds @xmath37 so that , to define the physical @xmath13 from the bare @xmath38 one has to apply a non - trivial correction . as a consequence , @xmath39 ( as now obtained from @xmath40 through eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) with a logarithmically divergent @xmath28 as in eq .",
    "( [ z2phi ] ) ) and @xmath41 scale uniformly in the continuum limit .",
    "at the same time , by construction , the shifted field becomes governed by a quadratic hamiltonian in the continuum limit , so that one finds @xmath42 as in leading - order perturbation theory .    by adopting this alternative interpretation of ` triviality '",
    "there are important phenomenological implications .",
    "in fact , assuming to know the value of @xmath13 , a measurement of @xmath16 would not provide any information on the magnitude of @xmath2 since the ratio @xmath43 is now a cutoff - independent quantity .",
    "moreover , in this approach , the quantity @xmath44 does not represent the measure of any _ observable _ interaction ( see the conclusions of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath45 has an important physical meaning , being a distinctive feature of the bose condensation phenomenon  @xcite . in the class of ` triviality - compatible ' approximations to the effective potential , one finds @xmath46 , with @xmath47  @xcite , @xmath48 being a cutoff - independent number determined by the quadratic shape of the effective potential @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , @xmath51 corresponds to the classically scale - invariant case or ` coleman - weinberg regime ' .    as for the standard interpretation of ` triviality ' , the gaussian effective potential approach can also be extended to any number n of scalar field components @xcite .",
    "in particular , when studying the continuum limit in the large - n limit of the theory , one has to take into account the non - uniformity of the two limits , cutoff @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "this is crucial to understand the difference with respect to the standard large - n analysis .    to check the alternative picture of refs .",
    "@xcite against the standard point of view , one can run numerical simulations of the theory and check the scaling properties of the squared higgs lattice mass @xmath54 against those of the inverse zero - momentum susceptibility @xmath55 . according to perturbation",
    "theory , these two quantities should scale uniformly in the continuum limit .",
    "therefore , a lattice computation of @xmath56 can resolve the issue .",
    "if ` triviality ' is true and perturbation theory is right , assuming a single rescaling factor @xmath57 , a lattice simulation has to show unambiguously that @xmath28 tends to unity when approaching the continuum limit . in this respect ,",
    "we observe that numerical evidence for different cutoff dependencies of @xmath28 and @xmath58 has already been reported in refs .  @xcite . in those calculations ,",
    "performed in the ising limit of the one - component theory , one was fitting the lattice data for the connected propagator to the ( lattice version of the ) two - parameter form @xmath59 after computing the lattice zero - momentum susceptibility @xmath60 , it was possible to compare the value @xmath56 with the fitted @xmath45 , both in the symmetric and broken phases . while no difference was found in the symmetric phase , @xmath28 and @xmath45",
    "were found to be sizeably different in the broken phase . in particular , @xmath45 was very slowly varying and steadily approaching unity from below in the continuum limit consistently with kllen - lehmann representation and ` triviality ' .",
    "@xmath28 , on the other hand , was found to rapidly increase _ above _ unity in the same limit . the observed trend was consistent with the logarithmically increasing trend predicted in refs.@xcite .",
    "now , to our knowledge , with the exception of refs .",
    "@xcite , there are no other systematic investigations of the scaling properties of @xmath61 vs. @xmath60 down to values of lattice mass @xmath62 . therefore we might conclude that , at the present , the alternative theoretical scenario of refs.@xcite is selected by the lattice data .",
    "a possible objection to this conclusion is that the two - parameter form eq .",
    "( [ gprop ] ) , although providing a good description of the lattice data , neglects higher - order corrections to the structure of the propagator . as a consequence , one might object that the extraction of the various parameters is affected in an uncontrolled way thus obscuring the observed difference between @xmath28 and @xmath45 .",
    "this objection is not very serious .",
    "in fact , if ` triviality ' is true , a two - parameter fit to the propagator data should become a better and better approximation approaching the continuum limit where the genuine perturbative corrections @xmath63 vanish as @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , neglected perturbative corrections that become less and less important can hardly explain the observed difference between @xmath28 and @xmath45 that , instead , becomes larger and larger .",
    "however , to provide additional evidence , we have decided to change strategy and perform a new set of lattice calculations of the zero - momentum susceptibility . in this way , rather than directly computing the higgs mass on the lattice , we shall compare the scaling properties of @xmath65 with the squared mass values predicted by perturbation theory .",

    "this can not be reconciled with the perturbative prediction , for @xmath98 , @xmath104 .    in our opinion",
    ", one should not ignore this discrepancy , for instance by attempting to further enlarge the error bars of the perturbative predictions so as to reach a marginal consistency with the lattice data .",
    "in fact , in this way no meaningful test of perturbation theory will ever be possible .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation for the symmetric phase where lattice data and theoretical predictions based on the central values of @xmath74 , as given in table  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , agree to good accuracy , see refs .  @xcite .",
