    "let @xmath0 be a convex polytope in @xmath1 such that there exists a face - to - face tiling @xmath2 of @xmath1 by translates of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath0 is called a _",
    "parallelohedron_. in the present paper @xmath3 will always stand for the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "as one can easily see , from the face - to - face property follows that @xmath4    in 1897 h.  minkowski @xcite established three necessary conditions for a convex polytope @xmath0 to be a parallelohedron .",
    "the statement of the first two is clear .    1 .",
    "a parallelohedron @xmath0 is a centrally symmetric polytope .",
    "all hyperfaces of @xmath0 are centrally symmetric .",
    "the third condition uses the notion of _ belts _ , defined for convex polytopes with centrally symmetric hyperfaces .",
    "let @xmath5 be a convex @xmath3-dimensional polytope with all hyperfaces being centrally symmetric .",
    "let @xmath6 be an arbitrary @xmath7-dimensional face of @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath6 determines a _ belt _ of @xmath5 , which is the set of all hyperfaces of @xmath5 parallel to @xmath6 .",
    "one can notice that each hyperface of the belt contains exactly two @xmath7-dimensional faces parallel to @xmath6 and each @xmath7-dimensional face parallel to @xmath6 is shared by exactly two hyperfaces of the belt .",
    "the third minkowski s condition is as follows .    1",
    ".   every belt of @xmath0 consists of 4 or of 6 hyperfaces .    later on , in 1954 , b.  a.  venkov @xcite has shown that conitions 1  3 are sufficient for a convex polytope @xmath0 to be a parallelohedron . thus the conditions 1  3 are commonly called _ minkowski ",
    "venkov conditions_.    let @xmath6 be a face of @xmath2 .",
    "define the _ associated cell _",
    "@xmath8 as the set of all centers of parallelohedra that share @xmath6 .",
    "this notion has been used , for example , by a.  ordine @xcite .",
    "the family of all associated cells of the tiling has a structure of a cell complex . in this complex @xmath9",
    ".    now let @xmath10 .",
    "consider a @xmath11-dimensional plane @xmath12 that intersects @xmath6 transversally . in a small neighborhood of @xmath6 the section of @xmath2 by @xmath12",
    "coincides with a complete @xmath11-dimensional polyhedral fan , which is called the _ fan of a face @xmath6_. ( compare with the definition of a _ star of @xmath6 _ by ryshkov and rybnikov @xcite . )    the combinatorics of the fan of @xmath6 is completely described by the poset of all dual subcells of @xmath8 , where the partial order relationship is the inclusion .    in 1929",
    "b.  n.  delaunay proved the celebrated theorem , which can be stated in the terms of the present paper as follows .",
    "[ delaunay ]    every associated cell of a @xmath13-dimensional face of a parallelohedral tiling is combinatorially equivalent to one of the following five 3-dimensional polytopes : tetrahedron , octahedron , quadrangular pyramid , triangular prism , parallelepiped .",
    "equivalently , every fan of a @xmath13-dimensional face is combinatorially equivalent to one of the fans shown in figure 1 .",
    "the significance of theorem [ delaunay ] becomes clear , as one considers its applications to known partial solutions of voronoi s conjecture @xcite .",
    "several important examples are @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a combinatorial proof of theorem [ delaunay ] using the notion of _ jammed polyhedral fans_. further , for every @xmath13-dimensional face @xmath6 we prove that the combinatorics of @xmath8 as an associated cell coincides with the combinatorics of @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the proof implies that @xmath8 has affine dimension 3 .    the term _ jammed fan _ ( or _ tight fan _ )",
    "was first introduced by andrey gavrilyuk in private discussions during the thematic program on discrete geometry at fields institute ( 2011 ) .",
    "he argued that the notion of jammed fans is interesting on itself and certainly deserves further investigation .",
    "further , we explore how we can associate a lattice to a face @xmath6 .",
    "the first option is to take the minimal sublattice of @xmath15 containing @xmath8 .",
    "this produces a 3-dimensional lattice we denote by @xmath16 .",
    "the second option is to consider the lattice @xmath17 obviously , @xmath18 .",
    "we prove that these lattices coincide .",
    "in other terms , the index @xmath19 is equal to 1 .",
    "the author does not know , whether the analogous result on lattices holds for @xmath20-faces .",
    "for @xmath21-lattice the analogous statement is false since a 5-dimensional simplex of index 2 can be a delaunay cell ( claimed without any particular example by voronoi  @xcite , checked explicitly by ryshkov  @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be a @xmath11-dimensional complete polyhedral fan in @xmath23 .",
    "consider an arbitrary face @xmath24 and let @xmath25 .",
    "we can define the _ fan of @xmath26 _ in the same way as fans of faces of parallelohedral tilings .",
    "namely , let @xmath12 be an @xmath27-dimensional plane in @xmath23 intersecting @xmath26 transversally . in some neighborhood of @xmath28 the section of @xmath22 by @xmath12 coincides with some complete @xmath27-dimensional polyhedral fan , which is called the _ fan of @xmath26_.    a cone @xmath24",
    "is called _ standard _ , if its fan is centrally symmetric .",
    "let @xmath26 be a standard cone of a complete fan @xmath22 .",
    "we say that the cones @xmath29 are symmetric with respect to @xmath26 if the central symmetry at @xmath28 interchanges the @xmath12-sections of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "obviously , for every standard cone @xmath24 all the faces @xmath32 such that @xmath33 split into pairs of centrally symmetric with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "a complete @xmath11-dimensional polyhedral fan @xmath22 is called _ jammed _ , if for every two distinct @xmath11-dimensional cones @xmath29 the cone @xmath34 is standard and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are centrally symmetric with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "further , a face @xmath6 of @xmath2 is called a _ standard face _ if @xmath6 is invariant under some central symmetry of @xmath15 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the intersection of two distinct parallelohedra of @xmath2 is a standard face or empty .",
    "hence proposition [ prop:1 ] follows .",
    "[ prop:1 ] a fan of every face of a parallelohedral tiling is jammed .    to proceed with the proof of theorem [ delaunay ]",
    ", we will classify all jammed three - dimensional fans . before we start with the classification , we emphasize some properties of a jammed three - dimensional fan .    [ p2 ]",
    "let @xmath22 be a three - dimensional jammed cone fan",
    ". then    1 .",
    "every ray @xmath35 has valence 3 or 4 . 2 .   for every two distinct three - dimensional cones",
    "@xmath29 exactly one of the following statements is correct : * @xmath36 is a two - dimensional cone ; * @xmath36 is a ray of valence 4 ; * @xmath22 is centrally symmetric , the central symmetry of @xmath22 exchanges @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath36 is the vertex of @xmath22 .",
    "it is obvious that a fan of every cone of a jammed cone fan is jammed .",
    "consider a ray @xmath35 .",
    "the fan of @xmath37 is two - dimensional .",
    "but it is not hard to see that a jammed two - dimensional cone fan can consist only of 3 or 4 two - dimensional cones .",
    "therefore statement 1 follows .    to check statement 2 consider the intersection @xmath34 . if @xmath38 , then ( i ) is true . if @xmath39 , then ( iii ) is true by definition of a jammed fan .",
    "finally , if @xmath40 , then @xmath26 is a standard ray of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore @xmath26 has an even valence , so the only possible valence of @xmath26 is 4 .",
    "thus ( ii ) holds .",
    "notice that the property 1 is essentially the minkowski - venkov condition on belts .",
    "assume that @xmath22 is an asymmetric three - dimensional jammed fan .",
    "thus statement 2.(iii ) of proposition [ p2 ] does not hold for any pair of distinct three - dimensional cones @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the number of rays in @xmath22 of valence 3 , @xmath42  the number of rays of valence 4 , @xmath43  the number of two - dimensional cones and @xmath44  the number of three - dimensional cones .    since every two - dimensional cone is incident to exactly 2 rays , @xmath45    consider a unit sphere @xmath46 centered at the vertex of @xmath22 . for every cone @xmath24 of dimension at least one",
    "the intersection @xmath47 is a disk of dimension @xmath48 .",
    "all these disks together can be treated as a representation of @xmath46 by a cw - complex with euler characteristic ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , exercise 8) ) equal to  2 .",
    "thus @xmath49    finally , since every 2 three - dimensional cones are incident in one of the ways described in proposition [ p2 ] , @xmath50    after excluing @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the system consisting of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , we get @xmath51    thus from the inequalities @xmath52 follows that @xmath53 or @xmath54 . using ( [ eq1 ] )   ( [ eq3 ] ) , we find that @xmath55    enumerating all combinatorial types of complete three - dimensional polyhedral fans with no more than 6 rays , we find all the possible combinatorial types of jammed fans .",
    "they are fans a ) , c ) and e ) in figure 1 .",
    "for symmetric fans we use the same notation @xmath56 as in section  [ sect:3 ] . then the identities ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) hold because of the same argumentation as above .",
    "the identity ( [ eq3 ] ) is replaced by @xmath57 where the new summand @xmath58 appears , since in this case there are @xmath58 pairs of 3-dimensional cones of @xmath22 with 0-dimensional intersection .",
    "as above , we exclude @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the system consisting of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( @xmath59 ) and obtain @xmath51    for symmetric complete polyhedral fans @xmath44 is even and at least 6 .",
    "thus the inequality @xmath60 implies @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , @xmath63 by enumerating all combinatorial types of complete centrally symmetric three - dimensional polyhedral fans with 6 or 8 rays , we conclude that in this case only 2 combinatorial types of jammed fans are possible .",
    "they are shown in figure 1 , b ) and d ) .",
    "let @xmath6 be a face of @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that the following two conditions hold .    1 .   for every associated cell @xmath64 being a subcell of @xmath8 , @xmath65 is a face of @xmath14 .",
    "conversely , for every face of @xmath14 the vertex set of that face is a subcell of @xmath8 .",
    "then we say that @xmath8 _ satisfies the duality conditions_.    in this section we prove the following result .    [ th:5.1 ]    the associated cell of every @xmath13-dimensional face @xmath6 of a parallelohedral tiling satisfies the duality conditions .",
    "first we show that @xmath66    assume that @xmath67 .",
    "then , obviously , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an arbitrary @xmath7-dimensional superface of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath70 be a projection along @xmath69 to a complementary 2-dimensional plane .",
    "it is known @xcite that the set @xmath71 is a tiling of a plane into hexagons if @xmath69 is primitive or into parallelograms if @xmath69 is standard .    in each case",
    "c ) , e ) in figure 1 the fan of @xmath6 contains a primitive @xmath7-face @xmath69 . then from the projection argument above follows that the set @xmath72 has no subset of 4 parallelohedra with a common point .",
    "but at least 4 parallelohedra share @xmath6 , a contradiction .    in the case",
    "d ) in figure 1 let @xmath69 be an arbitrary @xmath7-dimensional superface of @xmath6 . from the projection argument above we conclude that the set @xmath72 has no subset of 5 parallelohedra with a common point . but 8 parallelohedra share @xmath6 , a contradiction .    now let @xmath73 be a standard face of @xmath2 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "suppose that @xmath76 then , if @xmath77 denotes the center of symmetry of a polytope @xmath5 , @xmath78 since both sides equal @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "then every equation of type ( [ eq:5.2 ] ) implies @xmath82    for each separate case a ) ",
    "e ) in figure 1 write down all possible equations of type ( [ eq:5.3 ] ) . solving the resulting system gives 3 vectors @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 such that every vector @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is a linear combination of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 with particular real coefficients .",
    "thus @xmath14 is an image of a particular 3-dimensional polytope @xmath88 under some linear map .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq:5.1 ] ) shows that the map is not degenerate , so @xmath14 is affinely ( and then combinatorially ) equivalent to @xmath88 . in each case",
    "e ) the reader can use the system of equations of type ( [ eq:5.3 ] ) to specify @xmath88 and then check the duality conditions .",
    "for every @xmath13-dimensional face @xmath6 of a parallelohedral tiling holds @xmath89          according to a well - known statement ( see , for example , the paper @xcite by danzer and grnbaum ) , the translates of the minkowski symmetrization @xmath102 by vectors of @xmath101 do not overlap as well .          now suppose that @xmath14 is a tetrahedron and @xmath108 .",
    "the latter condition means that @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a vector of @xmath16 . if @xmath111 is a vector of @xmath16 , then the lattices @xmath112 coincide .",
    "thus for fixed @xmath8 the lattice @xmath16 is fixed and there are 7 candidates for @xmath101 .",
    "direct inspection shows that for each of the 7 possibilities each tetrahedron @xmath113 has at least one edge , the midpoint of which belongs to an another tetrahedron of the same form . on the other hand",
    ", one can easily check that all midpoint of eges of this tetrahedron lie in the interior of @xmath114 , a contradiction .",
