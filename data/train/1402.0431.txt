    "expanding paradigm of the universe has been affirmed by the contemporary observational data @xcite . the prime source behind this dramatic change in the evolution of the universe",
    "is said to be _ dark energy _ ( de ) .",
    "dark energy is a strange type of gravitationally repulsive energy component , spread over 72% of the contents in the universe .",
    "the nature of de is still a question mark and various representations have been proposed in general theory of relativity to understand it .",
    "holographic dark energy ( hde ) appeared as one of the most eminent candidates to address the issue of cosmic acceleration .",
    "the density of the hde has been proposed by incorporating the mathematical form of the holographic principle as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant , @xmath5 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath6 is the infrared ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "though hubble horizon @xmath7 is the natural possibility for @xmath6 but it does not imply the cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "li @xcite suggested that the future event horizon is the most appropriate choice for ir cutoff which seems to be consistent with recent measurements .",
    "the modification of the ir cutoff in hde has been reported in different scenarios such as introducing new time scale , considering @xmath6 as a function of the ricci scalar in both original and generalized form .",
    "wei and cai @xcite suggested a new model of agegraphic de by introducing conformal time as the time scale for the frw universe and is known as new agegraphic de ( nade ) .",
    "@xcite discussed the evolution of the new agegraphic quintessence de models in @xmath2 phase plane both with and without interaction .",
    "the nade model has been formulated in the context of alternative theories such as brans - dicke theory @xcite and ho@xmath8ava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "granda and oliveros @xcite proposed a new ir cutoff for hde in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 and discussed the correspondence of new hde ( nhde ) with models of scalar fields .",
    "this work has been extended for interacting case in non - flat universe @xcite .",
    "the modification of the einstein - hilbert action is another promising approach to explain the fact of cosmic acceleration . in this regard , there are various theories of gravity such as @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite-@xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite etc . the action of @xmath0 theory with matter lagrangian @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14}.\\ ] ] in literature @xcite-@xcite , people have discussed the cosmological reconstruction of @xmath0 theory according to the class of hde models .",

    "the explicit functions of @xmath0 in frw universe can also be obtained from the reconstruction procedure according to the given de model .",
    "setare @xcite obtained @xmath0 functions corresponding to hde and nade by assuming an ansatz for the scale factor . in @xcite",
    ", reconstruction has been executed for both ordinary and entropy corrected models of holographic and nade . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we have reconstructed @xmath11 models according to holographic and nade and found that the said models can represent the quintessence / phantom regimes of the universe .    here",
    ", we regard the nade and nhde as promising models and apply the numerical scheme for reconstructing @xmath0 without introducing any additional de factor .",
    "the future evolution of @xmath0 is presented for different values of the essential parameters .",
    "we assure the evolution of @xmath0 by analyzing the corresponding behavior of cosmographic parameters in particular de models .",

    "the initial condition on @xmath33 can be set from eq.([4 ] ) as @xmath34 one can determine @xmath33 using eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) and hence the evolution of the universe in nade can be executed .",

    "the difference in the selected parameters @xmath128 can be seen more effectively in the future evolution of @xmath1 reconstructed according to the nhde as shown in figures * ( 12)*-*(14)*. for @xmath129 and @xmath130 in figure * 12 * , the curve shows that initially @xmath58 decreases before reaching the present epoch @xmath131 which changes its direction and it would increase leading to the phantom de . in this scenario , @xmath58 keeps growing whereas @xmath1 initially decreases and then attains positive value approaching to @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , in phantom de models the point of reversion is a common characteristic because the de components succeed in their competition with matter contents of the universe . for @xmath133 and @xmath134 ,",
    "we have almost identical picture as in figure * 12 * but here growing rate in @xmath1 is comparatively large . for @xmath135 and @xmath136",

    "the eos parameter intersects the phantom divide line ( @xmath66 ) and behaves as quintom model of de @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", @xmath75 ends up with phantom era which may lead to cosmic doomsday when all the astronomical objects will be ripped apart .",

    "the plot of statefinder diagnostic in nhde for different values of parameters @xmath128 is shown in figure * 17*. the dot represents the fix point @xmath143 ( _ i.e. _ , the de sitter phase ) and all the curves pass through this point .",
    "the @xmath0 theory stands as one of the prosperous contexts to describe the cosmic evolution and the present day observational consequences .",
    "this theory appears to be a potential candidate in explaining the late time accelerated expansion . a profound model which can explain the cosmic evolution in a definite way is still under consideration .",
    "the cosmological reconstruction of @xmath0 gravity has been explored in @xcite-@xcite and the issue of which approach should be used is still alive . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 function corresponding to a class of hde models has been constructed by assuming some ansatz for the scale factor in frw background . a more effective scheme to reconstruct @xmath0 theory from the given evolution history @xmath144 is developed by capozziello et al . @xcite .",
    "in this scheme , the significant thing is that we can develop the correspondence of @xmath0 theory to the given de model by using the expression of respective @xmath144 . as a result",
    ", one can find the @xmath0 theory which explains the same dynamics ( _ i.e. _ , the cosmic evolution ) as predicted by the given de model .",
    "now it is of interest to consider the modified hde models and address the intrinsic degeneracy among the @xmath0 theory and de models .",
    "we find that predictions of both candidates ( @xmath0 theory and de models ) reconcile as they represent distinct features of the same picture .    in this work ,",
    "we have reconstructed the function @xmath0 according to nade and nhde in flat frw geometry .",
    "the numerical reconstruction scheme is applied to obtain the evolution trajectories of @xmath1 in different scenarios . in this reconstruction procedure , the hubble parameter plays a significant role as we transform all quantities in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * for nade , @xmath9 is given in terms of @xmath33 , so we solve the system of evolution equations for both @xmath33 and @xmath1 .",
    "the results are shown in figures * 1 * and * 2 * which are consistent with the constructed functions in literature @xcite-@xcite . in comparison with hde , the future variation of @xmath58 and @xmath1 show identical behavior for different values of @xmath53 .",
    "we can say that the behavior of @xmath1 suggest the de sitter phase in late time evolution of the universe .",
    "the cosmological parameters have been explored in nade for @xmath145 to make sure the evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "figures * 5 * -*8 * evidently show that nade favors the quintessence regime and in future evolution , it may end up with the de sitter phase .",
    "thus our results for reconstructed @xmath0 are consistent with the independent evolution of nade .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we have taken significantly different values of @xmath53 but all of these contribute similar results . * in case of hde with granda - oliveros cutoff , the hubble parameter in the form @xmath103 is directly used in numerical calculations .",
    "we have shown the function @xmath1 in @xmath146 and @xmath60 planes in figure * 9*. these curves seem to be identical for different values of parameters @xmath128 and slight difference is found for @xmath147 plane which is shown in figure * 10*. further , we probe the future evolution of @xmath58 and obtain distinct variations accordingly as @xmath148 . the future evolution of @xmath1 in figures * 12 * -*14 * evidently show the role of parameters @xmath149 .",
    "these plot represent distinct features of @xmath1 which have been later confirmed by the evolution trajectories of @xmath75 and @xmath84 in figures * 15 * and * 16*. for @xmath150 , it can be seen that @xmath1 depicts the phantom de era and in such case @xmath126 and @xmath151 . for @xmath152 ,",
    "we have @xmath1 representing the de sitter phase with @xmath66 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , our results for the function @xmath1 corresponding to nhde coincide with that of cosmographic parameters .",
    "it is to be noted that nade and nhde models are developed in the context of general relativity rather than any modified theory such as @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we have reconstructed @xmath0 by considering the curvature part as an effective description of these de models .",
    "we also emphasize that this work is more comprehensive when comparing with previous ones as it involves the analysis of cosmological parameters to ensure the evolution of reconstructed function @xmath0 .",
