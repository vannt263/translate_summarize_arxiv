    "how to extend the transition state theory ( tst)@xcite to the quantum regime has been a long standing theoretical challenge.@xcite within the classical mechanics , the tst is a well defined theory with firmly established computational methods and simulation protocols .",
    "however , the very concept of measuring flux at a localized dividing surface is at odds with the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle .",
    "moreover , the notion of sorting out  trajectories \" that do not recross , which allows the tst to be the upper bound of a true barrier crossing rate , is difficult to envision quantum mechanically .",
    "in fact , it does not seem clear whether a practical quantum tst ( qtst ) that translates all the assumptions of the tst to quantum regime can be developed at all .    while genuine qtsts serving as a rigorous upper bound for quantum barrier crossing rates have been developed,@xcite they are either difficult to implement or lack quantitative accuracy .",
    "thus , here we adopt a loose definition of qtst as a quantum barrier crossing rate theory approaching the tst in the classical limit .",
    "various qtsts that allow practical calculations have been developed based on a wide range of theoretical approaches .",
    "one approach is to invoke approximate time dependent quantum dynamics@xcite near the barrier top , which results in time dependent rates , and to define the qtst as the steady state limit of the time dependent rate expression .",
    "another approach is to abandon explicit consideration of the dynamics from the outset and to extract the rate from the quantum partition function representing metastable reactant states.@xcite justification for this latter approach can be made through analytic continuation of the partition function to the complex time domain or by an argument of detailed balance .",
    "theoretical formulations unifying the two approaches have also been developed.@xcite    recently , hele and althorpe ( ha ) proposed a new formulation of qtst,@xcite hereafter termed as ha - qtst , and suggested that they have proven its equivalence to the ring polymer molecular dynamics tst ( rpmd - tst).@xcite they argued that ha - qtst is a true qtst in the sense that it corresponds to an exact @xmath0 limit of a quantum flux - side correlation function . a follow - up work@xcite presented another formal analysis suggesting again that the ha - qtst is exact under a condition of no recrossing , which however was defined in a formal way without a physical definition of quantum mechanical recrossing .",
    "a careful theoretical examination of this overall formalism issue is therefore important for our general understanding of qtst .",
    "a distinctive aspect of ha - qtst is that the formulation starts from a special kind of quantum time correlation function which is apparently constructed based on a mathematical consideration of its @xmath0 limit , the physical basis of which is not clear . in addition , as will be analyzed in detail in sec .",
    "iii , ha s proof for the equivalence between the @xmath0 limit of their quantum correlation function and the rpmd - tst@xcite rate can evidently only be understood through an incorrect or at best approximate application of a quantum mechanical identity .",
    "when this is corrected , we find that the true limit of ha - qtst for the case of centroid dividing surface becomes identical to the well - known path integral quantum transition theory ( pi - qtst ) expression above the crossover temperature,@xcite which can be understood in a much simpler manner@xcite and amounts to classical approximation for the dynamical factor .",
    "thus , as will be explained in sec .",
    "iii , the implications@xcite of ha - qtst need to be reassessed .    as a formalism alternative to ha - qtst , we then present a new path integral based quantum rate expression , starting from the well established yamamoto expression@xcite for the exact quantum rate based on the linear response theory,@xcite and employing a recently developed quantum dynamics formalism,@xcite hereafter called as real time dynamics of imaginary time path integral ( rdip ) . in the classical limit ,",
    "the @xmath1 limit of our rate expression becomes equal to classical tst .",
    "however , if the quantum limit is taken first , the @xmath1 limit of the rate expression can be shown to be zero due to quantum delocalization .",
    "this is consistent with other work,@xcite and confirms the assessment@xcite that constructing a rigorous qtst as the @xmath1 limit of a quantum dynamics is likely to be impossible .",

    "therefore , it seems likely that no quantum rate theory retaining all the properties of classical tst can be found .",
    "even with this fundamental limitation , it may still be possible to define a quantum rate as long as the measurement of rate is defined so as to be consistent with the history@xcite of quantum preparation .",
    "thus , a formulation of quantum rate theory approaching tst in the classical limit , which serves as the definition of qtst here , is suggested to be possible , although it does not necessarily have to be unique .",
    "two popular frameworks for defining a quantum rate have been the scattering formulation@xcite and the linear response theory,@xcite with the former favored in the field of gas phase dynamics and the latter in the field of condensed phase dynamics . in both cases",
    ", a physically meaningful qtst can be defined in the steady state limit where the reactant and product population states have completely decohered due to spatial separation or action of environments . only in the classical limit where the decoherence time becomes effectively zero ,",
    "can such a steady state limit be replaced with the @xmath1 limit . in this sense ,",
    "the suggestion by ha that a true qtst can be defined as the exact @xmath1 limit of a quantum time correlation function and that it also reproduces the rate expression of rpmd - tst , which is approximate in nature even in the @xmath1 limit , is unclear .",
    "such a suggestion also conflicts with a significant body of earlier works on how qtst might be defined , and has therefore motivated us to carry out a detailed analysis of ha - qtst .    in this paper ,",
    "we have identified two significant concerns with the development and assumptions of ha - qtst .",
    "first , we note that the gkscf introduced by ha as the starting point of their qtst is not related to a time correlation function for the observable rate constant@xcite from the linear response theory.@xcite this is an important issue because the rate is defined as the @xmath1 limit of its time derivative , which should be affected significantly by the nature of the initial expression and the initial physical conditions .",
    "second , we identified an incorrect application of a quantum mechanical identity , namely the replacement of average imaginary time momenta along the imaginary time paths at @xmath34 with the real time momenta variables under the classical approximation at @xmath1 .",
    "the two are independent variables , and such a replacement is not strictly allowed quantum mechanically .",
    "when the @xmath1 limit is evaluated employing a corrected expression , the resulting @xmath1 limit turns out to be the same as the pi - qtst rate expression above the crossover temperature@xcite for the case of centroid dividing surface .",
    "this confirms the equivalence of assumptions of the two approaches .",
    "in other words , the ha s formulation amounts to making classical approximation for the quantum dynamical factor and does not provide an exact quantum mechanical derivation of the rpmd - tst rate expression .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with our previous analysis based on the rdip formulation@xcite showing that rpmd differs from the exact quantum dynamics even for harmonic oscillators at zero time .    finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we have presented an alternative path integral approach for evaluating the quantum rate expression based on the exact linear response theory quantum rate expression@xcite and by employing the formalism of rdip.@xcite we have shown that the @xmath1 limit of this rate expression becomes zero in the quantum regime , which reproduces the known quantum mechanical behavior in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "application of this formalism to the quadratic barrier model is expected to be exact considering its result for harmonic oscillator system.@xcite whether this alternative approach will also be amenable to practical calculations of general anharmonic systems will be a focus of future research .",
