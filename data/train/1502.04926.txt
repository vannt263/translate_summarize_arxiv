    "in an epr steering test , we consider that alice and bob pre - share an unknown quantum state @xmath5 onto which alice performs one out of @xmath1 unknown measurements @xmath6 ( labelled by @xmath7 ) , each with @xmath0 outcomes ( labelled by @xmath8 ) .",
    "the unnormalised post - measurement states prepared for bob are given by @xmath9 the set @xmath10 is called an _ assemblage _ @xcite , from which one can obtain both the conditional probabilities @xmath11 for alice to obtain the outcome @xmath12 given that she made measurement @xmath13 , @xmath14 , as well as the conditional states themselves @xmath15 .",
    "bob is assumed to perform trusted measurements and therefore can perform full state tomography to determine to arbitrary accuracy the members of the assemblage he holds .",
    "the interest in epr steering derives from the fact that it allows one to certify the presence of quantum entanglement in this semi - device - independent scenario @xcite . to see how ,",
    "let us assume that the source distributed a separable state @xmath16 .",
    "this imposes the following structure on the assemblages created : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the above structure is called a _ local hidden state model _ ( lhs model ) for the assemblage @xmath19 , and assemblages which have a lhs model are called unsteerable @xcite .    crucially , not all assemblages have a lhs model .",
    "this can always be certified through the violation of a linear steering inequality , given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a collection of operators defining the inequality and @xmath22 is the maximum value that a unsteerable assemblage can reach , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath23",
    "a crucial problem which arises when carrying out a steering test is the overall detection efficiency .",
    "that is , whereas in an idealised steering test the source will always create a pair of particles and in every run the measurements performed will give an outcome , in reality this is not the case .",
    "the particles may be lost en route , and the detectors may produce no click even if the a particle arrives . this problem becomes especially important in cryptographic applications , as an adversary can use the experimental imperfections to try and trick the parties into believing they have witnessed entanglement , although a separable state has in fact been used @xcite .",
    "if the detection efficiency is not unity , instead of observing the assemblage , the one actually observed is given by @xmath24 where we have introduced the outcome @xmath25 to denote ` no - click ' events , @xmath26 is the reduced state of bob and @xmath27 is the overall detection efficiency of alice , taking into account all of the losses , either on the channel or at the detectors . following previous works",
    "@xcite we do not consider the effects of losses in bobs side , since by assumption his devices are trusted and can not be used by an eavesdropper to open the detection loophole .",
    "our goal is thus to derive steering inequalities which detect steering starting from assemblages of the form , whenever @xmath3 .",
    "let us start by choosing an inequality formed of @xmath1 projective measurements of the form @xmath28 where each @xmath29 is a rank-1 projector and at this stage @xmath30 is a positive constant which needs to be chosen in order to make the steering inequality useful .",
    "it is necessary to determine @xmath31 , the lhs bound as a function of @xmath32 , which is found by maximising the value of @xmath33 over all lhs assemblages .",
    "this is seen to be the solution to the optimisation problem .",
    "as we show in the appendix , we can transform this problem in an instance of a semidefinite program @xcite , and exploit its duality theory to find a simple upper bound on @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we show that by choosing @xmath34 _ i.e.  _ the maximal inner product between any two measurement directions between any two different measurements , then @xmath35 thus , any assemblage which obtains a value greater than this value demonstrates steering .",
    "we will now show that the above inequalities certify steering whenever @xmath3 .",
    "assume that the assemblage in was created by alice performing inneficient von neumann measurements , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath36 on the maximally entangled state @xmath37 .",
    "consider furthermore the steering inequality of the form with @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "a direct calculation shows that @xmath40 where we use the fact that @xmath41 .",
    "the requirement @xmath42 is satisfied whenever @xmath3 . we note that although in the above we considered that the maximally entangled state @xmath43 is distributed between the parties , similar to @xcite it is straightforward to adapt to a situation where an arbitrary pure schmidt - rank-@xmath0 state @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , is distributed between the parties instead .",
    "details can be found in the appendix .    in conclusion ,",
    "any set of @xmath1 von neumann measurements satisfying the minimal requirement that no two measurements share a common outcome can be used to demonstrate steering in a loophole - free manner as long as the detection efficiency satisfies @xmath3 , i.e. in a loss - tolerant manner .",
    "a key advantage of our construction is that the specific choice of measurements is not important  the only relevant property of the measurements used is the maximal overlap between any two distinct measurement outcomes , and as long as this is not unity measurements , such that the remaining set of @xmath47 measurements contains no two measurements sharing a common direction .",
    "] then a steering inequality can be easily written down .",
    "since in practice one can never generate a pure maximally entangled state , it is important to see what level of noise can be tolerated by the steering tests presented here . to that end , let us consider that alice and bob share the isotropic state @xmath48 and that alice performs projective measurements @xmath29 as before . in this case the assemblage created is @xmath49 this leads to the following requirement to demonstrate steering @xmath50 since @xmath51 depends upon both @xmath1 and @xmath0 this bound is hard to analyse in general . however , let us specialise to the case of prime - power dimension and assume that alice performs @xmath52 mub measurements , in which case @xmath53 . for small @xmath0",

    "@xcite for spin measurements as they are only violated for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . ]    for large @xmath0 it is possible to calculate the asymptotic behaviour of the inequalities violations . in particular , considering constant @xmath55 , the series expansion in @xmath0 leads to the following asymptotic behaviour for @xmath4 : @xmath59 on the other hand , keeping @xmath4 constant , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath55 for large @xmath0 is given by : @xmath60    in fig .",
    "[ f : w vs d ] we show the behaviour of the critical white noise tolerance @xmath61 for @xmath62 , for exponentially growing system size @xmath0 , and show the comparison with the the best known lhs bound and with other inequalities known for steering and nonlocality .",
    "another feature of our inequalities is that they allow to observe unbounded violations of steering inequalities which are also robust to losses .",
    "the study of unbounded violations of steering inequalities were recently initiated in @xcite following on from the work which was done for the case of nonlocality @xcite , and was observed in a setting without losses . following these works , we will define the _ normalised violation _ of a steering inequality by @xmath63 , i.e. we are interested in the magnitude of the difference between the lhs bound and the quantum violation .    from equations",
    "and we immediately see ( recalling that by construction the steering inequality only takes non - negative values ) , @xmath64 specialising to the case of @xmath56 mub measurements in prime - power dimension @xmath0 , this becomes @xmath65 thus , whenever @xmath4 scales slower than @xmath66 , then an unbounded violation is obtained for sufficiently large dimension .",
    "this in particular includes the physically relevant case of constant losses independent of the dimension of the system .",
    "note furthermore , that in the case @xmath67 we obtain exactly the same steering inequality as in @xcite , and therefore our construction can be seen as a generalisation of the one presented there , to include situations with losses .",
    "while for projective measurements the notion of compatibility of a collection of measurements is captured by the commutativity of the povm elements , for more general measurements this is no longer adequate @xcite .",
    "the natural generalisation for general measurements is that of _ joint measurability _ , which amounts to the existence of a single ` parent povm ' from which , upon coarse - graining , all of the povm elements can be obtained .",
    "more concretely , a set of @xmath1 @xmath0-outcome povms @xmath68 is said to be @xmath1-jointly measurable ( @xmath1-jm ) if there exists a single @xmath69 outcome parent povm @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is an @xmath1-dit string @xmath72 such that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the string formed of all the dits of @xmath71 except @xmath75 .    as mentioned in the introduction , epr steering not only certifies the presence of entanglement , but also the presence of non - jm measurements , as it can straightforwardly be shown that measurements of the form when applied by alice to half of any state prepare lhs assemblages for bob , i.e. of the form .",
    "consider now the set of inefficient von neumann measurements @xmath76 given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the probability of obtaining a ` no - click ' outcome labelled by @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is a von neumann projective measurement for each @xmath13 .",
    "these measurements can be seen to exactly prepare assemblages of the form .",
    "that is , we can think of these as the measurements actually being performed by alice in a lossy steering test .",
    "since we have seen in the previous section that demonstrates steering whenever @xmath3 , this certifies that the measurements are not jm for the same range of @xmath4 . in the appendix",
    "we show a explicit parent povm for @xmath81 .",
    "we have given a general construction of experimentally friendly loss - tolerant linear steering inequalities in arbitrary dimension which are violated whenever alice performs von neumann measurements and the losses are not worse than @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the violation of these inequalities tolerates high values of white noise .",
    "put together , these facts promote the inequalities derived here as strong experimental tests of epr steering , that are robust to losses and experimental imperfections and are valid for any set of von neumann measurements in any dimension .",
    "a fundamental consequence of our results is the fact that @xmath1 inneficient von neumann measurements become jointly measurable only when their detection efficiencies are below @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to finish by comparing the results obtained here with the previous state - of - the art results concerning steering and bell nonlocality tests with losses . in @xcite a steering test involving a two - qubit maximally entangled state and 16 measurements arranged in a precise way was shown to tolerate efficiencies down to @xmath82 .",
    "the steering tests provided here go beyond this result in several senses : first , we have shown that any set of @xmath1 measurements suffices to demonstrate steering iff detection efficiencies are higher than @xmath2 . moreover",
    ", our construction works for states in every dimension .",
    "in fact , by increasing the dimension the present steering tests become arbitrarily robust to white noise ( see fig . [",
    "f : w vs d ] ) .",
    "notice that ref .",
    "@xcite shows a steering test that tolerates arbitrary losses , although the state that has to be used in this test approaches a separable state , thus quite fragile to experimental imperfections .",
    "when it comes to bell tests , the best known bell inequalities @xcite need to increase the state s dimension to tolerate arbitrary losses , whereas for the steering tests developed here arbitrary losses can be tolerated in any dimension . moreover , the inequalities of @xcite work , once more , for specific choices of states and measurements , and can only tolerate low levels of noise , again in contrast to those demonstrated here .",

    "this form is advantageous , since the @xmath89 are fixed , thus this takes the form of a set of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) .",
    "using this re - writing , the problem ( 7 ) of the main text can be written as @xmath90 which is now seen to be an sdp , since all constraints are positive semidefinite constraints or lmis . to obtain the dual , we first write the lagrangian of this problem @xmath91+\\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the dual variables to the first and second ( sets of ) constraints respectively .",
    "this lagrangian is unbounded from above unless @xmath94 imposing this constraint enforces @xmath95 . by choosing @xmath96",
    "we have that the following minimization problem upper bounds the primal problem @xmath22 : @xmath97 which can be simplified to @xmath98",
    "by defining @xmath100 , problem is seen to be equal to @xmath101 where the maximisation is over the set of @xmath102 operators @xmath103 , one corresponding to each deterministic strategy which alice can employ .",
    "let us define for each @xmath71 the number of no - click outcomes @xmath79 that the string contains , which we denote by @xmath104 .",
    "given this , we can split the set @xmath105 into sets @xmath106 according to the number of no - click outcomes , @xmath107 the purpose for doing this is that now each @xmath103 inside the set @xmath106 has the same structure , namely @xmath108 where we denote an arbitrary rank-1 projector as @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , inside each set @xmath106 the operator norm of each member is given by @xmath110 to proceed we make use of the following result , which will be proved in the proceeding section : @xmath111 since each @xmath112 contains only at most one measurement direction from each measurement @xmath29 it is clear that if we define @xmath113 then @xmath114 , since @xmath115 comes from taking a maximisation over a subset of the set maximised over for @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we obtain an upper bound for every @xmath116 depending only upon the set @xmath106 it belongs to @xmath117 valid except when @xmath118 . in this exceptional case , consisting of the single strategy @xmath119 of @xmath1",
    "no - click outcomes , @xmath120 and @xmath121 by inspection .",

    "we end by noting that @xmath127 corresponds to a trivial inequality which can never be violated , which is seen for example by considering the assemblage created from perfectly efficient measurements ( @xmath62 ) on the maximally entangled state , which obtains the value @xmath128 .",
    "in this section we will prove the following inequality which holds for the sum of @xmath130 rank-1 projectors acting on an arbitrary finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath111 let us introduce an auxiliary hilbert space @xmath132 , and define a standard basis @xmath133 , @xmath134 , for this space .",

    ". therefore we will use @xmath141 to do so .",
    "first , we note that we can write @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes addition modulo @xmath130 .",
    "this decomposition amounts to writing @xmath141 as a block diagonal matrix plus a sum of @xmath144 matrices , each with a block structure and containing only displaced diagonals ( i.e. have the structure of a block permutation matrix ) .",
    "the first term of the right hand side of has operator norm @xmath145 since the operator norm of a block diagonal operator is the maximal operator norm of any block , which in our case is unity .",
    "for each of the remaining terms we can use the fact that the operator norm , being equal to the largest singular value , is invariant under the transformation @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are unitary . choosing @xmath149 and @xmath150 we see that @xmath151 and thus @xmath152 again due to the block structre of the transformed matrix .",
    "since @xmath153 we can place the same bound @xmath115 on each of the @xmath154 terms . finally by using repeatedly the triangle inequality @xmath155",

    "in this section we will show that it is possible to use an arbitrary pure entangled schmidt - rank @xmath0 state to demonstrate steering with arbitrary losses .",

    ", then we have that @xmath158 , i.e. we can see it as the ( unnormalised state ) after a local filtering by alice . by performing measurements on this state",

    "notice that @xmath161 , i.e. the action of @xmath162 does not stop alice from preparing rank-1 states for bob , only the directions and normalisations have changed .",
    "it thus follows directly that the inequality @xmath163 where @xmath164 certifies steering as long as @xmath165 and @xmath3 .",
    "in this section we show that any set of @xmath1 inefficient measurements ( von neumann or not , with an arbitrary number of outcomes ) is jointly measurable if @xmath81 .",

    "<S> finally , using the relation between epr steering and joint measurability , our results further provide an explicit certificate that @xmath1 inefficient von neumann measurements are not jointly measurable whenever @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this matches the lower bound below which these measurements can not demonstrate steering @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organised as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we first introduce the relevant notions of epr steering and then show how to construct a steering inequality starting from any set of von neuman measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that this inequality witnesses steering for detection efficiencies satisfying @xmath3 and study the tolerance to white noise when using mub measurements . </S>",
    "<S> finally we briefly introduce joint - measurability and show how the inequalities also witness the non - joint measurability of inefficient measurements . </S>"
