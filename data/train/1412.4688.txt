    "@xcite showing a metallic character .",
    "the nonmetallic character of li@xmath14mno@xmath15 is also observed at very low lithium vacancy concentrations , e.g. , at @xmath151 . in the delithiation process , @xmath0 is , in principle , the electronic charge carrier .",
    "however , as also discussed in sec .  [ sec;conduc ] , the bound oxygen hole polaron is stable only in the presence of @xmath87 and thus @xmath0 transport in the material near the start of delithiation is likely to be poor due to the low concentration of the lithium vacancies .",
    "our results thus explains why it is difficult to electrochemically activate . regarding the lithiation process",
    ", the structure of li@xmath90 indicates that , for each additional li atom inserted into electrodes , the material receives one positively charged lithium interstitial li@xmath145 and one electron polaron @xmath85 ; i.e. , the li insertion is associated with the reduction of mn@xmath7 to mn@xmath9 .",
    "the partially lithiated composition can thus be written as li@xmath152mno@xmath15 or , explicitly , li@xmath152[mn@xmath153mn@xmath154o@xmath15 .    the deintercalation voltage associated with the extraction of the first lithium from the bulk supercell according to the above - mentioned delithiation mechanism",
    "is found to be 5.30 v. this value is higher than the average voltage of 5.05 v computed between and , by using unit cells each containing two formula units and assuming a topotactic transition between the two limits , or the average voltage of 4.90 v between li@xmath155mno@xmath15 and .",
    "the difference indicates that the @xmath0 component of @xmath88 is energetically more favorable at high lithium vacancy concentrations .",
    "we note that the calculated voltage also depends on whether lithium is removed from the interior of the material or from the surface .",
    "for example , our preliminary results show that the deintercalation voltage associated with the formation of @xmath0 is 4.44 v at the ( 001 ) surface of , obtained in calculations using a semi - infinite bulk slab containing 108 atoms [ similar to the supercell model presented in fig .  [",

    ", we find that @xmath0 , i.e. , o@xmath92 , can be stable as free ( unbound ) hole polarons on the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the calculated voltage is thus lower at the surface , as expected since the lattice environment at the surface is less constrained than in the bulk .",

    "regarding the other mechanisms proposed for the delithiation of , we find that the oxidation of mn@xmath7 to mn@xmath8 [ mechanism ( i ) ] is unlikely as our investigations find no evidence of the formation of mn@xmath8 ions .",
    "the simultaneous removal of lithium and oxygen [ mechanism ( ii ) ] may occur at the surface or interface ; however , oxygen is unlikely to be transported from the bulk of li@xmath14mno@xmath15 to the surface or interface to maintain the reaction , at least at low @xmath1 values , as the energy barrier associated with oxygen migration is too high ; _ cf . _",

    "( i.e. , mn@xmath9 ions ) and/or localized electrons @xmath108 , can help initiate the delithiation process as the mechanism associated with the oxidation of oxygen [ mechanism ( v ) , described above ] is not likely to be dominant at the onset of delithiation due to the poor electronic conduction associated with @xmath0 .      in or",
    ", each ionic defect has only one stable charge state , which is also called the elementary defect , except the manganese antisites mn@xmath113 where the mn ion can be stable in 2 + , 3 + , or 4 + oxidation state . removing ( adding ) electrons from ( to ) these elementary defects always results in defect complexes consisting of the same elementary defects and small hole ( electron ) polarons at the nearby lattice site(s ) .",
    "even mn@xmath113 does not produce any shallow defect level .",
    "in addition , several positively and negatively charged defects have positive formation energies only near midgap ( _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ fig;formenergy ] ) , making them perfect charge compensators .",
    "any attempt to deliberately shift the fermi level of the system from @xmath82 to the vbm or cbm will thus result in the charged defects having negative formation energies , i.e. , the intrinsic defects will form spontaneously and counteract the effects of shifting @xcite . clearly , intrinsic point defects in and can not act as sources of bandlike electrons and holes , and the material can not be doped n- or p - type .",

    "for the ionic conduction , the lower bound of the activation energy is estimated to be 1.32 ev , the sum of the lowest formation energy ( 0.71 ev ) and migration barrier ( 0.61 ev ) of @xmath91 . here ,",
    "again , we assume that the concentration of lithium vacancies is low and thus the monovacancy migration mechanism is predominant . in partially delithiated li@xmath14mn[o@xmath149o@xmath150 ,",
    "athermal @xmath0 and @xmath91 are the predominant charge - carrying defects .",
    "the lower bound of the activation energy for ionic conduction is estimated to be 0.29 ev , which is the lowest migration barrier of @xmath91 associated with the divacancy mechanism .",
    "the oxygen hole polaron @xmath0 that is bound to @xmath91 can , in principle , contribute to the electronic conduction .",
    "however , a high concentration of @xmath91 would be needed in order to form the percolation pathways for @xmath0 diffusion .",
    "the difficulty in @xmath0 transport , especially at low lithium vacancy concentrations , is likely to result in poor electronic conduction and electrochemical performance .",
    "massarotti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report that is an insulator with a very small electrical conductivity ( @xmath161 s / cm ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the high electronic and ionic activation energies associated with @xmath85 and @xmath91 , respectively , estimated from our calculations for the stoichiometric compound .",
    "it may also indicate that in their measurements @xmath0 does not effectively contribute to the total conductivity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , report an activation energy of 0.46 ev for li@xmath10 hopping in samples prepared by ball milling and sintered at 900@xmath80c .",
    "this value is higher than the calculated migration barrier of @xmath91 associated with the lithium divacancy mechanism but lower than that associated with the monovacancy mechanism , suggesting that there is a high concentration of athermal lithium vacancies in their samples .",
    "it should be noted that a comparison between calculated and measured values is usually complicated by the fact that the latter can be sensitive to the synthesis conditions and the measurements .",
    "we anticipate that the electronic conduction associated with @xmath0 can be more effective at the surface or interface .",
    "diffusion length shortening can also help improve the @xmath0 transport .",
    "in fact , electrochemical performance improvement through nanostructuring has been explored and shows positive results which may be ascribed , at least partially , to an improvement in the electronic conduction .",
    "nanoparticles and nanowires , in particular , are reported to exhibit superior electrochemical properties compared to their bulk counterpart @xcite .",
    "finally , the electronic conduction can also be improved via ion substitution .",
    "a partial substitution of mn@xmath7 in with electrochemically active metal ions would introduce an additional electronic conduction and charge - compensation mechanism that is highly needed at the start of the delithiation process .",
    "indeed , this appears to be the case in ( @xmath13 ) cathode materials where ru@xmath7 ions can be oxidized to ru@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we carry out a comprehensive study of the bulk properties and defect physics in layered lithium manganese oxide cathode materials using a hybrid dft / hartree - fock method .",
    "we find that layered has a jahn - teller distorted , monoclinic structure and its energy at 0 k is degenerate with that of orthorhombic .",
    "an analysis of the electronic structure in shows that the contribution from mn 3d states to the vbm is larger than that from o 2p states in each oxygen atom ; whereas the vbm in is predominantly o 2p states .",
    "this difference between the two compounds results in different defect physics , particularly in those intrinsic point defects whose formation involves removing electrons from the top of the valence band .",
    "manganese antisites are found to have low formation energies and thus can occur with high concentrations in layered ; the low energies can be partially ascribed to the small ionic radius difference between high - spin mn@xmath84 and li@xmath10 .",
    "these antisites can act as nucleation sites for the formation of orthorhombic or spinel phases during synthesis or electrochemical cycling .",
    "an elimination of these antisite defects would require significant changes to the chemical environment such as through ion substitution .",
    "can also have high concentrations of manganese antisites ; however , unlike in , they can be eliminated by tuning the experimental conditions .",
    "other intrinsic point defects may also occur and have an impact on the materials properties and functioning .",
    "a detailed analysis of the formation of lithium vacancies in layered indicates that the delithiation process is associated with the oxidation of mn@xmath9 to mn@xmath7 , leading to the formation of small hole polarons @xmath83 at the transition - metal site . in li - excess , the intrinsic mechanism for lithium extraction is found to be associated with the oxidation of o@xmath11 to o@xmath92 , leading to the formation of bound hole polarons @xmath0 at the oxygen site .",
    "other delithiation mechanisms can also occur in and may be dominant near the start of the delithiation process ; however , it is this intrinsic mechanism that can explain the large reversible capacity observed in experiments .",
    "we also find that in both compounds the intrinsic point defects can not act as sources of bandlike electrons and holes and the materials can not be doped n- or p - type .",
    "the electronic conduction proceeds through hopping of hole and/or electron polarons ; the ionic conduction occurs through lithium monovacancy and/or divacancy migration mechanisms .    since hole polarons @xmath0 are not stable in the interior of in the absence of negatively charged lithium vacancies , the electronic conduction at low lithium vacancy concentrations is likely to be poor due to the lack of percolation pathways for @xmath0 diffusion",
    "we suggest that one can improve the electronic conduction and , hence , the electrochemical performance of through nanostructuring and/or ion substitution .",
    "finally , the results and discussion presented in this work can also shed light on the electrochemical properties of -based or related materials , opening the door to utilizing the oxygen oxidation mechanism for high - capacity battery electrodes .",

    "<S> an analysis of the formation of lithium vacancies indicates that lithium extraction from is associated with oxidation at the manganese site , resulting in the formation of manganese small hole polarons ; whereas in the intrinsic delithiation mechanism involves oxidation at the oxygen site , leading to the formation of bound oxygen hole polarons @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the layered oxides are found to have no or negligible bandlike carriers and they can not be doped n- or p - type . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic conduction proceeds through hopping of hole and/or electron polarons ; the ionic conduction occurs through lithium monovacancy and/or divacancy migration mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath0 is not stable in the absence of negatively charged lithium vacancies in bulk , the electronic conduction near the start of delithiation is likely to be poor . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the electronic conduction associated with @xmath0 and , hence , the electrochemical performance of can be improved through nanostructuring and/or ion substitution . </S>"
