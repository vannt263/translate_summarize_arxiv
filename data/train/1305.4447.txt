    "originally , `` symmetric functions '' are thought of as `` functions of the roots of some polynomial '' @xcite .    the factorization formula @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ( multi-)set of roots of @xmath2 ( a polynomial ) invites to consider @xmath3 as a `` multiset ( endo)functor '' rather than a function @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is a field where @xmath2 splits ) .",
    "but , here , @xmath6 whenever @xmath7 and one would like to get the universal formulas _",
    "i.e. _ which hold true whatever the cardinality of @xmath8 .",
    "this set of formulas is obtained as soon as the alphabet is infinite and , there , this calculus appears as an art of computing symmetric functions without using any variable . with this point of view",
    ", one sees that the algebra of symmetric functions comes equipped with many additional structures @xcite ( comultiplications , @xmath9-ring , transformations of alphabets , internal product ,  ) . for our concern here ,",
    "the most important of these features is the fact that the ( commutative ) hopf algebra of symmetric functions is self - dual .    at the cost of losing self - duality ,",
    "features of the ( hopf ) algebra of symmetric functions carry over to the noncommutative level @xcite .",
    "this loss of self - duality has however a merit : allowing to separate the two sides in the factorization of the diagonal series , thus giving a meaning to what could be considered a complete system of local coordinates for the hausdorff group of the stuffle hopf algebra .",
    "indeed , the elements of the hausdorff group of the ( shuffle or stuffle ) algebras excatly are , through the isomorphism @xmath10 , the characters of the algebra .",
    "then , applying @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) to the factorization @xmath13 and using the fact that @xmath14 is a ( continuous ) character , one gets a decomposition of @xmath14 through this complete system of local coordinates  : @xmath15 this fact is better understood when one considers sweedler s dual of the ( shuffle of stuffle ) hopf algebra @xmath16 , which contains as well @xmath17 and its lie algebra , the space of infinitesimal characters .",
    "such a character is here a series @xmath18 such that ( as a linear form ) @xmath19 and one sees from this definition that such a series , as well as the characters , satisfies an identity of the type @xmath20 for some finite double family @xmath21 .",
    "then in ( [ series ] ) , the character @xmath14 is factorized as an ( infinite ) product of _ elementary _ characters .",
    "this shows firstly , one can reconstruct a character from its projection onto the free lie algebra is the projection onto the free lie algebra parallel to the space generated by the non - primitive elements of the pbw basis ] and secondly , we have at hand a resolution of unity from the process @xmath22 and the key point of this resolution is exactly the system of coordinate forms provided by the dual family of any pbw homogeneous basis .",
    "this paper is devoted to a detailed exposition of the machinery and morphisms surrounding this resolution ( equation ( [ resolution ] ) ) and it is structured as follows  : in section [ background ] , we give a reminder on noncommutative symmetric and quasi - symmetric functions , in section [ factorization ] , we focus on the combinatorial aspects of the quasi - shuffle hopf algebra will be introduced to obtain , via schtzenberger s monoidal factorization , a pair of bases in duality for the noncommutative symmetric and quasi - symmetric functions , encoded by words .",
