    "supernova ( sn ) 2002bu was discovered on 2002 march 28 by @xcite in the galaxy ngc  4242 , with a fairly low peak magnitude @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the last pre - discovery observations on 2001 february 21 and march 14 placed a unfiltered magnitude limit at the location of the sn of 20.5  mag . a low resolution spectrum taken by @xcite on april 1 showed a flat continuum and strong , narrow balmer emission lines ( fwhm @xmath11 1100 km / s ) that led to a type  iin classification of the sn .",
    "the early ( @xmath1280 days post peak ) light curve presented by @xcite and @xcite showed a plateau and a slower rise and decline as compared to other type  ii sne , with the color becoming redder with time .",
    "@xcite proposed that sn  2002bu may be a member of a new class of stellar transients , with the prototypes being sn  2008s @xcite and the 2008 optical transient ( ot ) in ngc  300 @xcite .",
    "the class is characterized by a transient  progenitor pair , where the transient is @xmath13 mag fainter than a regular core collapse sn ( ccsn ) , with narrow emission lines and evidence of internal extinction in the spectrum , while the progenitor is a dust enshrouded , low luminosity ( @xmath125@xmath14 ) star with little variability in the years before the outburst ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in mid ",
    "magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) , the progenitors occupy the extreme end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) sequence and the obscuring dust is graphitic rather than silicate ( @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "further showed that these transients are relatively common among ccsne ( @xmath1220% ) , but their progenitors are extremely rare ( @xmath15 of massive evolved stars ) , which implies that many massive stars go through this dust obscured phase shortly ( @xmath16 yrs ) before the explosion .",
    "the rarity of the progenitor stars was further confirmed in the survey of additional galaxies by @xcite .",
    "since the main characteristic of the new class is a dust enshrouded progenitor , it is impossible to unambiguously classify sn  2002bu as a member , as there are no pre  explosion ir observations of the region .",
    "however , @xcite found a bright , red mid - ir source at the location of sn  2002bu in spitzer space telescope ( sst ) data taken 2 years after the explosion , which indicates dust formation .",
    "this , together with the transient characteristics ( low luminosity , dust and narrow emission lines visible in the spectrum ) , make sn  2002bu a likely member of the new class . in addition , @xcite analyzed 5 spectra taken between 11 and 81 days after discovery , and they show that the spectrum of sn  2002bu becomes redder with time and evolves from a spectrum resembling an lbv in outburst at early times , to one more similar to the spectra of sn  2008s and the ngc  300  ot 81 days later .",
    "the evolution of the h@xmath17 line from a lorentzian profile to an asymmetric , blueshifted gaussian profile , is suggestive of newly formed dust . in @xcite",
    "we argued that the early light curve also indicates dust formation , albeit with some ambiguities .",
    "in @xcite we analyzed archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) and sst data from approximately two years after the transient peak .",
    "as previously reported by @xcite , sn  2002bu was a luminous mid - ir source in 2004 , but @xcite also found that it was invisible in archival hst data from 2005 in the bvri bands to limits of @xmath18  mag .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in 2004 was well fit by surrounding a @xmath19  k , @xmath20 source with an optically thick ( @xmath21 ) shell of dust located at a radius of approximately @xmath22  cm .",
    "broadly speaking , there are three possible explanations of the observations , as we discussed in our mid - ir survey of the `` supernova impostors''(@xcite ) .",
    "the first , `` traditional '' , view of these events is that a shell of material is ejected during the optical transient and forms dust once the ejected material becomes cool enough .",
    "as the shell expands , its optical depth drops as @xmath23 and the characteristic temperature drops as @xmath24 because the shell expands with the ejecta velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the dust radius at the time of the previous sst observations of sn  2002bu was consistent with a shell expanding at the velocity of @xmath26  km / s adopted by @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is that the optical transient is a signal that the star is entering a high mass loss phase with a dense wind that forms dust and obscures the source .",
    "while the wind is steady , the optical depth is roughly constant with a dust temperature close to the dust destruction temperature @xmath27  k unless the wind becomes optically thick in the mid - ir . when the high mass loss phase ends , the evolution quickly resembles the first scenario ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the third scenario is the one introduced by @xcite to explain sn  2008s and the ngc  300  ot .",
    "here the progenitors are already shrouded by a very dense wind when an explosive transient occurs that destroys most of the dust to leave the transient little obscured at peak .",
    "the wind is so dense , however , that the dust reforms and re - obscures the transient . the present day luminosity is a combination of a surviving star ( if any , nothing in the data requires one ) and the luminosity generated by the shock propagating through the wind . at later times",
    ", the optical depth outside the shock is dropping as @xmath28 and , once the optical depth is low enough , the x - rays produced in the shock should be observable .",
    "these scenarios make different predictions for the time evolution of the transient , so monitoring the evolution of sn  2002bu as a function of wavelength should reveal the nature of the event . here",
    "we report near - ir hst , mid - ir sst and swift x - ray observations of sn  2002bu taken roughly 10 years after the transient peak and 8 years after the the last hst and sst observations .",
    "section  2 presents the new observational data .",
    "we discuss the results in section  3 , and consider their broader implications in section  4 .",
    "we observed sn  2002bu with sst in june 2011 and january 2012 , in both the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] @xmath29 m bands ( program i d 80015 ) with exposure times of 240  sec ( 8 dithered 30 sec exposures ) for both bands .",
    "we also observed it with hst in february 2012 using the wfc3/ir camera and the f110w ( @xmath30 ) and f160w ( @xmath31 ) filters ( proposal i d 12450 ) with exposure times of 2@xmath32700  s for each band .",
    "figure  [ fig : ssthst ] shows the changes in the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] images between 2004 and 2012 as well as a zoomed in view of the region in the @xmath30 and @xmath31-band hst images .",
    "the source has become significantly fainter in the mid - ir , more so at [ 3.6 ] than at [ 4.5 ] , but any near - ir counterpart must still be very faint .",
    "figure  [ fig : closeup ] shows a close - up view of the region in the f160w image .",
    "we identified 12 reasonably isolated stars in the hst images that could be matched to the sst images using the iraf _ immatch _ package . using the 2004 @xmath33 m image as the reference frame , we obtain the estimated sn position in the hst data shown by the circle in figure  [ fig : ssthst ] and a cross in figure  [ fig : closeup ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the position is approximately 1.5  hst pixels or @xmath34 .",
    "the spitzer fluxes were measured with aperture photometry ( _ apphot _ package in iraf ) , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we measure the flux of the source using a range of source and sky apertures ( with appropriate aperture corrections ) and then combine the individual results taking into account both the formal statistical and the systematic uncertainties implied by the scatter in the fluxes found for different aperture combinations .",
    "we analyzed the hst images using the dolphot @xcite photometry package with its standard wfc3 parameter files .",
    "dolphot identifies three sources within a radius three times larger than our estimated astrometric uncertainties .",
    "we label these sources a , b and c in order of their distance from the estimated position ( see figure  [ fig : closeup ] ) .",
    "the photometric results are presented in table  [ tab : mags ] together with the previous hst and sst flux measurements from @xcite .",
    "we adopt a distance to ngc  4242 of 5.8  mpc based on @xcite and a foreground galactic extinction of @xmath35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that the distance to ngc  4242 is uncertain .",
    "there is a second tully - fisher distance estimate of 10.4  mpc by @xcite ( erratum in @xcite ) , and if we associate ngc  4242 with the group containing ngc  4258 it lies at the intermediate distance of @xmath36  mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "our qualitative conclusions are unaffected by these uncertainties .",
    "quantitatively , luminosities increase proportional to @xmath37 , dust radii increase as @xmath38 , and the velocities implied by the dust radii increase as @xmath38 .",
    "the actual photometric models are essentially distance independent other than these scalings .",
    "we comment on the effects of distance changes as necessary .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows near - ir h / j@xmath39h cmds constructed from the dolphot catalogs for a large ( 23@xmath3220 ) and a small 35 ( 100 pc ) radius region around the sn .",
    "we required the signal - to - noise ratio in both filters to be greater than 4 for a detection ( see @xcite ) , and a sharpness parameter @xmath40 to exclude non - stellar sources .",
    "the cmds are corrected for galactic extinction ( @xmath41  mag , @xcite ) and assume a distance of @xmath42  mpc @xcite .",
    "we mark the locations of sources a , b and c in both cmds .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ fig : cmd ] also shows the padova ( @xcite ) isochrones for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45  years , that have zams masses corresponding to their end points of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the isochrones are moderately bluer than the stars , which could be evidence for @xmath49  mag ( for 5.8  mpc , @xmath50  mag for @xmath51  mpc ) of local extinction",
    ". unfortunately , the optical detection limits are not strong enough to constrain these possibilities .",
    "for all these distances and extinctions , the local stellar population is only consistent with the older isochrones , ages closer to @xmath52 years and a maximum mass of @xmath53 than @xmath43  years and a maximum mass of @xmath54 . since adding these extinctions have little effect on our near / mid - ir models , we add no additional extinction beyond galactic to the models in  3 .",
    "we also observed sn2002bu with _ swift _ @xcite between april 2630 2011 , for a net exposure of 15  ks .",
    "we reprocessed the xrt data using the ` xrtpipeline ` tool provided by the swift team and reprojected the observations into a single image .",
    "we chose the source region to be a circle centered on the sn with a radius of 10 pixels ( 23@xmath556 ) and a nearby background region without any sources .",
    "we did not detect the source either in the full ( 0.210  kev ) or the 0.20.5  kev , 0.52  kev , and 210  kev bands .",
    "we obtained 1@xmath56 limits of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60  cnt  s@xmath61 , respectively , for these bands , where we corrected the small aperture used in the analysis based on the _ swift _ psf @xcite . assuming thermal bremsstrahlung emission with @xmath62  kev and galactic absorption of @xmath63 @xcite",
    ", we obtained a flux limit of @xmath64 in the 0.52  kev band that roughly corresponds to a luminosity limit of @xmath65 .",
    "more generally , we model the emission as thermal brehmsstrahlung emission at a temperature @xmath66 obscured by an additional column density @xmath67 associated with the source .",
    "we use the pimms model for the swift / xrt to estimate the absorbed soft , medium and hard - band count rates and constrain the unabsorbed total luminosity to be consistent with the observed upper limits for the three energy bands .",
    "we used dusty ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to fit the seds of the sources detected in hst near - ir data .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the probability averaged seds of sn  2002bu in may  2004 and january  2012 ( for sources a , b and c , treating near - ir hst measurements of source a either as detections or upper limits ) . the best fit model to the 2004/2005 data",
    "is taken from @xcite and corresponds to a @xmath19  k , @xmath20 star surrounded by an optically thick ( @xmath21 ) shell of dust expanding at @xmath12900  km / s .",
    "both graphitic and silicate models give similarly good fits to the data .",
    "we also embedded dusty in a markov chain monte carlo engine to model the seds , varying the dust temperature , @xmath68 , optical depth , @xmath69 , and stellar temperature , @xmath70 , with either a fixed 2:1 ratio between the inner and outer radii of the shell or allowing the ratio to vary between 1.1 and 10 .",
    "we included a weak prior on the stellar temperature , @xmath71 , ( and restricted its range to @xmath72 ) and on the expansion velocity implied by the inner radius of the shell , @xmath73 .",
    "for the 2012 epoch we ran models considering star a as either a detection or an upper limit .",
    "the results allowing for variations in the shell thickness were little different from those with a fixed thickness and no particular thickness was preferred , so we only report the results for the fixed thickness in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the results for the 2004 epoch are the same as in our earlier models from @xcite .",
    "the source must be quite luminous , @xmath74 , but with an indeterminate source temperature because of the heavy obscuration .",
    "the optical depth in graphitic models is @xmath75 ( scattering plus absorption ) , and it is moderately higher in the silicate models because of the higher scattering opacities of silicate dusts ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . significantly higher optical depths begin to have significant opacity even for the shorter wavelength irac bands , inconsistent with the shape of the sed .",
    "the dust temperatures at the inner edge of @xmath76  k are roughly in the range expected for newly forming dust .",
    "the dust radius is estimated to be @xmath77 , implying a velocity of @xmath78 that is consistent with the velocity prior taken from the line widths cited by @xcite .",
    "note , however , the uncertainties are much smaller than those of the prior , so the data are in fact determining this radius and velocity rather than the prior . despite the reasonable coverage of the mid - ir sed ,",
    "graphitic and silicate dusts fit the data equally well . as discussed earlier , the primary effect of distance uncertainties",
    "is simply to rescale the luminosities , velocities and distances . in particular",
    ", adopting the distance to ngc  4258 ( @xmath36  mpc ) raises the velocity from @xmath79  km / s to @xmath80  km / s , while using the @xcite distance of @xmath51  mpc raises it to @xmath81  km / s .",
    "one reason we adopted the smaller distance is that the larger distances begin to require significantly larger mean expansion velocities than implied by spectroscopic observations during the transient ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of the sed in 2012 depends critically on whether any source in the hst images corresponds to sn  2002bu .",
    "if source a ( or b / c ) is a detection , then the present day source must be a relatively hot , @xmath82  k , star . for graphitic dust",
    ", the star is relatively low luminosity @xmath83 , with moderate @xmath84 obscuration , at a relatively large radius @xmath85 that corresponds to a lower average expansion velocity @xmath86 but is uncertain enough to be consistent with no change in velocity .",
    "the dust temperature at the inner edge is much cooler , @xmath87  k. in the silicate models the source is more luminous , @xmath88 with greater optical depth , @xmath89 , located at a smaller radius @xmath90 , that now requires a slower expansion rate @xmath91 .",
    "the dust temperature at the inner edge is moderately warmer , @xmath92  k. there is no basis for choosing between the two dust types . if the association with source a is simply a coincidence and we instead treat the hst fluxes as upper limits , then solutions with cool stars are allowed , but they require increasingly high optical depths for lower temperatures , @xmath93 for the coolest ( @xmath94  k ) models .",
    "this is essentially the limit of the fully obscured progenitors of sn  2008s and the ngc  300-ot ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the current position of the source in the mid - ir cmd ( see figure  [ fig : midir_cmd ] ) , close to the tip of the agb sequence , is similar to that of the sn  2008s or ngc  300-ot progenitor stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is simply a coincidence driven by the present luminosity and dust radius , because in steady state a surviving star could not support the necessary optical depths given the velocities needed to have new material at such large distances .",
    "the population studies by @xcite and @xcite imply a lifetime in the obscured phase of order @xmath95  years .",
    "the mass loss rate is related to the optical depth by @xmath96 for visual opacity @xmath97  @xmath98/g , mass loss rate @xmath99 and wind speed @xmath100 , which implies a total mass loss of @xmath101 while the star is in its obscured phase .",
    "no star could sustain this for @xmath102  km / s , so the current state can not represent a long lived period and must be a transient phase . the progenitors , under the super - agb star hypothesis of @xcite , can have the necessary lifetimes because dust driven wind velocities of @xmath103-@xmath104  km / s are so low ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , such a slow wind commencing after the transient would not even have started to form dust at this point in time .",
    "the second possibility is the traditional view of the supernova impostors as stars that briefly enter a high mass loss state during the transient to produce a shell of ejected material that then forms dust . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "sn  2002bu probably started forming dust too soon after the transient peak to have formed it in ejected material .",
    "the more serious problem is that between 2004 and 2012 an expanding , dense shell should have a radius growing as @xmath105 and an optical depth dropping as @xmath6 .",
    "if we take the elapsed time from discovery to the irac observations in 2004 ( 736 days ) and 2012 ( 3566 days ) , the radius should have increased by a factor of @xmath106 and the optical depth should have dropped by a factor of @xmath107 . fig .",
    "[ fig : params ] illustrates this by comparing the mean expansion velocities and optical depths for the two epochs and both grain types .",
    "if we scale the values in 2004 to their expected values in 2012 simply using the expected temporal scalings , we see that the observed properties in 2012 have a significantly higher optical depth and may require some deceleration of the expansion rate .",
    "this leaves the scenario developed by @xcite for sn  2008s and the ngc  300-ot , where the absorption is due to a dense pre - existing wind . in this scenario ,",
    "the progenitors were obscured by a dense , dusty wind where the dust is destroyed by the shock breakout luminosity from the explosive transient so as to leave the transient with little obscuration at peak .",
    "the densities are so high , however , that the dust can then reform and re - obscure the system , consistent with the early dust formation suggested by the spectra and photometry . in the sn  2008s scenario ,",
    "the material already exists at these distances and so dust can begin ( re-)forming very rapidly . if the luminosity is then powered by a combination of any surviving star and an expanding shock wave , the optical depth to the shock front is only dropping as @xmath108 .",
    "the resulting drop in the optical depth by only a factor of @xmath106 is far more compatible with the observations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : params ] . arguably , the shock should also be slowing as it expands through the dense wind . self - similar solutions ( e.g. @xcite ) give expansion rates of @xmath109 and @xmath110 where @xmath111 for ejecta with an effective density profile @xmath112 expanding into a @xmath113 wind .",
    "the typical approximations for the structure of the ejecta are @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , leading to a modest slowing with time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : params ] we show the scaling of the conditions in 2004 to 2012 for this shock scenario ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) .",
    "if a significant part of the present day luminosity is driven by x - rays from an expanding shock , inferences about the temperature of the illuminating source and the exact value of the optical depth become somewhat problematic . in the shock scenario ,",
    "the x - rays are absorbed by the dense gas and remitted as a complex , non - thermal ( mainly ) emission line spectrum , which is then absorbed and reradiated by the dust . while the shock emission models of @xcite do not extend to the regimes considered here , they generally have relatively low near - ir emission compared to optical / uv emission and so would resemble a hot star model .",
    "the estimates of the optical depth , which are driven by the near - ir detections , should also be viewed as being only logarithmically correct in this scenario .",
    "the overall luminosity , dust temperature and dust radius , which are largely determined by the mid - ir emissions from the dust , should still be accurate .",
    "if we fit the expansion of the dust radius as a power law , @xmath121 , we find @xmath122 ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) for the graphitic models and @xmath125 ( @xmath126 , @xmath124 ) for the silicate models .",
    "the silicate models are consistent with linear expansion only at @xmath7 . similarly ,",
    "if we fit the evolution of the optical depth as a power law , @xmath127 , we find @xmath128 ( @xmath129 , @xmath124 ) and @xmath130 ( @xmath131 , @xmath124 ) for the graphitic and silicate models , respectively .",
    "the @xmath132 scaling of expanding shells is ruled out at roughly @xmath7 .",
    "we can also fit the evolution of the optical depth as a power law in radius , @xmath133 , finding @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) for the two models . while this appears to be consistent with the @xmath138 scaling for an expanding shell",
    ", there is a strong covariance between this exponent and the expansion rate of the shell  a solution with @xmath138 must also roughly have @xmath139 .",
    "essentially , for the same change in optical depth there is considerable uncertainty in the radius because we lack a complete dust sed in 2012 for constraining the dust temperature . in the two - dimensional probability distribution of the @xmath140 and @xmath141 exponents ,",
    "the expanding shell solution with @xmath142 and @xmath143 is still ruled out at roughly @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution is consistent with the @xmath144 and @xmath145 evolution of the expanding shock model .",
    "a shock moving through a wind at velocity @xmath146 has a characteristic x - ray energy of @xmath147 where the mean molecular weight is @xmath148 , and produces luminosity @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the efficiency with which the shock energy is radiated as x - rays ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the radius of the shock @xmath151  cm is simply related to its velocity , where @xmath152  days is the elapsed time from the transient to the x - ray observation .",
    "this means that the hydrogen column density outside the shock radius is @xmath153 combining these three equations with the pimms models for absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung , we can determine the range of shock velocities and wind density parameters ( @xmath154 ) that would violate the swift limits , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : params ] .",
    "if the shock velocity is as high as the @xmath155  km / s fwhm reported by @xcite , then there are allowed solutions for low wind densities ( where the x - ray luminosity is low but little absorbed ) , and high wind densities ( where the x - ray luminosity is high but heavily absorbed ) . if the shock velocity @xmath156  km / s , then the x - ray emission limits are satisfied for any wind density .",
    "the parameters derived from the photometric fits broadly satisfy these limits on the x - ray emission .",
    "half the graphitic solutions violate the limit in fig .",
    "[ fig : params ] , but the limit as drawn is for 100% conversion of the shock energy into soft x - rays and a @xmath124 detection threshold , which is a rather optimistic representation of the detection threshold .",
    "the basic picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : params ] is little changed if we use the larger distances to ngc  4242 , with all solutions and limits simply shifting to higher velocities .",
    "while this increases the shock luminosity , the net effect is limited because the x - ray luminosity limits from the observations become correspondingly weaker .",
    "combining spitzer , hubble and swift observations of sn  2002bu , we confirm the arguments in @xcite and @xcite that this source is a member of the sn  2008s class of transients .",
    "while we have no direct evidence that the progenitor was self - obscured , dust appears to have begun forming before any ejecta would be cool enough to do so and the optical depth of the dust is dropping significantly more slowly than the @xmath132 scaling of an expanding shell of material .",
    "the evolution is broadly consistent with the expanding shock model of @xcite for sn  2008s and the ngc  300-ot .",
    "it is not consistent with an expanding shell of ejected material or a reformed , slow wind around a surviving dusty star .",
    "unfortunately , our swift x - ray observations only constrain the allowed parameter space since we failed to detect x - ray emission from the shock .",
    "@xcite argued from an analysis of the stellar populations near the ngc  300-ot that the progenitor could be as massive as @xmath157 , while @xcite argued for @xmath158 because the progenitor appeared to be an extreme agb star based on its location in mid - ir cmds .",
    "the ambiguity is possible because the most luminous agb stars have luminosities comparable to evolved @xmath159 stars .",
    "formally , however , these population analyses only provide upper mass limits , so it is entirely possible to have a transient ( even a supernova ) from a @xmath160 star in a region containing @xmath161 stars .",
    "however , the local stellar environment of sn  2002bu , like that of sn  2008s ( @xcite ) , appears to contain no stars more massive than @xmath158 .",
    "in fact , the environment of sn  2002bu appears to favor still lower masses , closer to @xmath162 than @xmath163 .",
    "this strongly favors the interpretation of @xcite and @xcite that the sn  2008s class of transients is associated with agb stars .",
    "the very low mass scale implied by the environment of sn  2002bu does not , however , favor the possibility that the transients are electron capture supernovae ( @xcite , @xcite ) , as these are only expected for masses of @xmath164-@xmath163 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "obtaining deep optical images of the sn  2008s and 2002bu fields to better constrain the extinction and temperatures of the nearby stars would greatly improve the characterization of the stellar populations over our present near - ir results .    as with all the `` supernova impostors '' , the only way to determine their natures is to continue to track the evolution of their spectral energy distributions .",
    "it is clear from our survey in @xcite that there are at least two classes of sources and that no sources with adequate data were consistent with a brief period of high mass loss during the transient leading to the formation of a dusty expanding shell that obscured the source .",
    "the strength of this conclusion is strongly limited by the fragmentary nature of the data in both wavelength and time . here",
    "we see that the sn  2008s transient class can remain dust - obscured for long periods of time , primarily because the optical depth is not evolving like that of an expanding shell .",
