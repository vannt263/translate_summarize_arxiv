    "now let us consider the disk string worldsheet whose boundary is attached to the d3-brane expressed by eqs .",
    "let the worldsheet coordinates be @xmath45 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath46 is the radial coordinate of the disk .",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to the boundary , while @xmath48 to the center of the disk .",
    "the other coordinate @xmath49 is the angular coordinate of the disk . the string worldsheet action is written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the induced metric and @xmath52 is the gauge field .    in this letter , we consider the following special ansatz . @xmath53 since the center of the worldsheet @xmath48 is one point and should be mapped to one point in spacetime , the condition @xmath54 is imposed .",
    "meanwhile the boundary value of @xmath55 is denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "this boundary of the string is attached to the d3-brane , and it gives a constraint on the boundary value of @xmath44 as @xmath57 .    putting this ansatz into the action ,",
    "we obtain ( prime `` @xmath58 '' denotes the @xmath59 derivative ) @xmath60 the constant shift of the boundary action is fixed so that @xmath61 at @xmath62 where the boundary of the worldsheet shrinks to a point .",
    "if we fix the boundary value @xmath63 , the bulk action has the lower bound @xmath64 this bound is saturated when @xmath65 this configuration actually satisfies the equations of motion derived from the bulk action .",
    "this configuration is shown in figure [ fig - bubble ] .      when we derive the bound , we assume the boundary @xmath56 is fixed .",
    "however this is not the true boundary condition ; the boundary of the string worldsheet can move along the d3-brane . in this sense",
    "the configuration is not a stationary point of the action .",
    "though the configuration is not a solution , it is still useful to evaluate the path - integral ; it is `` the bottom of the trough '' @xcite .",
    "we explain here how to evaluate the path - integral using the configuration .",
    "we want to evaluate the path - integral @xmath67 with the correct boundary condition determined by the configuration of the d3-brane .",
    "this integral can be rewritten as @xmath68 in the path - integral @xmath69 the boundary value of @xmath55 is fixed to @xmath63 .",
    "hence is the saddle point of this integral .",
    "the path - integral @xmath69 can be evaluated by the point . @xmath70",

    "is the exponentially small term that we want to see here .",
    "it is written as @xmath78=\\exp\\left[-{\\widetilde{s}}(0)+o(\\log \\sqrt{\\lambda})\\right ]   \\cong \\exp\\left[-\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\left(\\sqrt{1+\\kappa^2}-1\\right)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{disk - result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the main result of this letter .",
    "the result agrees with the matrix model result .",
    "this small non - perturbative effect can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "there are two forces acting on the string end point : the string tension pulling the end point inside , and the electric force pushing the end point outside .",
    "the string tension is always larger than the electric force , and there is no stationary point other than the constant map .",
    "however , as the string worldsheet becomes larger and larger , the difference of these two forces becomes smaller and smaller . actually when the worldsheet is large enough ( @xmath79 )",
    ", the two forces almost cancel each other and the worldsheet boundary can be moved almost freely without increasing or decreasing the action .",
    "in other words , however large the worldsheet becomes , the action remains finite .",
    "the correction is the result of this effect .",
    "this kind of exotic effect is not present for a flat d - brane in the flat space . in this case",
    ", the action diverges as the worldsheet becomes larger .",
    "thus the contribution to the amplitudes is zero .",
    "therefore the dbi action does not capture this effect since it is based on the small curvature approximation .",
    "there is an intuitive explanation why the configuration with @xmath80 produces the term @xmath20 .",
    "it is proposed in @xcite how the eigenvalue distribution of the gaussian matrix model can be seen in @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ eigen - string ] represents the configuration in the picture of @xcite .",
    "when @xmath63 is close enough to @xmath81 , this picture around center is similar to figure [ eigen - matrix ] ; the fundamental string looks like @xmath30 and the d3-brane look like @xmath28 around the center , is supposed to be different from the one used in the circular fundamental wilson loop @xcite .",
    "one can distinguish these two , for example , by the value of the action .",
    "our string attached to the d3-brane has the action @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand the on - shell action of the string which represent the fundamental wilson loop is @xmath83 . ] .    from the similar point of view , one may guess a branched d3-brane configuration , shown in figure [ branched - d3 ] , contributes as another monomial in the symmetric wilson loop . calculating this contribution",
    "is an interesting future problem .    '' of @xcite , while vertical direction is the radial direction of @xmath84 fiber .",
