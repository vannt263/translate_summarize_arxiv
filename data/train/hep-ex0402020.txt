    "the measurements performed at the tevatron collider are complementary to the @xmath0  factories .",
    "for example , no @xmath6  mesons or baryons containing @xmath7  quarks are produced on the @xmath1  resonance .",
    "the fermilab accelerator complex has undergone a major upgrade in preparation for tevatron runii .",
    "the centre - of - mass energy has been increased to 1.96  tev as compared to 1.8  tev during runi .",
    "but most importantly , the main injector , a new 150  gev proton storage ring , has replaced the main ring as injector of protons and anti - protons into the tevatron .",
    "the main injector also provides higher proton intensity onto the anti - proton production target , allowing for a luminosity goal of 1 - 2@xmath8  @xmath9s@xmath5 , representing a luminosity increase of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the present bunch crossing time is 396  ns with a @xmath10 @xmath11 bunch operation .",

    "the data taking efficiency of both collider experiments has reached about 80 - 95% on average .",

    "the upgrades to the muon system almost double the central muon coverage and extend it up to @xmath21 .",
    "the most important improvements for @xmath0  physics in runii are a silicon vertex trigger ( svt ) and a time - of - flight ( tof ) system with a resolution of about 100  ps .",
    "the later employs 216 three - meter - long scintillator bars located between the outer radius of the cot and the superconducting solenoid .",
    "the time - of - flight system will be most beneficiary for the identification of kaons with a 2@xmath22-separation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25  .",

    "the cdf semileptonic triggers require an additional displaced track associated with the lepton , providing cleaner samples with smaller yields .",
    "new to the cdf detector is the ability to select events based upon track impact parameter .",

    "measurements of @xmath0  hadron masses and lifetimes are basic calibration measures to demonstrate the understanding of heavy flavour reconstruction .",
