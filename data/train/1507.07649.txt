    "the problem of superconductivity in bcs  bec crossover region ( and up to the strong coupling limit ) has a long history , starting with early works by leggett and nozieres and schmitt - rink [ ] .",
    "probably the simplest model to study this crossover is hubbard model with attractive interaction .",
    "the most successive approach to the studies of hubbard model ( both repulsive and attractive ) is the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) [ ] .",
    "attractive hubbard model was already studied within dmft in a number of papers [ ] .",
    "however , up to now there are only few works , where disorder effects were taken into account , either in normal or superconducting phases of this model .",
    "qualitative analysis of disorder effects upon critical temperature @xmath4 in bcs  bec crossover region was presented in ref .",
    "[ ] , which claimed the validity of anderson theorem in this region for the case of @xmath5-wave pairing . diagrammatic analysis of disorder effects on @xmath4 and the properties of the normal state in crossover region was recently presented in ref .",
    "[ ] .    we have developed the generalized dmft+@xmath0 approach to hubbard model [ ] , which is quite convenient for the account of different `` external '' interactions , e.g. such as disorder scattering [ ] .",
    "this approach is also well suited to the studies of two  particle properties , such as dynamic ( optical ) conductivity [ ] . in a recent paper [ ] we used this approach to analyze the single  particle properties of the normal phase and optical conductivity in attractive hubbard model .",
    "further on the dmft+@xmath0 approximation was combined with nozieres ",
    "schmitt - rink approach to study the influence of disorder on superconducting critical temperature @xmath4 in bcs ",
    "bec crossover and strong coupling region [ ] , demonstrating the validity of the generalized anderson theorem .",
    "disorder effects upon @xmath4 are essentially due only the general widening of the conduction band by random scattering .",
    "this was demonstrated exactly ( for the whole range of attractive interactions ) in the case of semi ",
    "elliptic density of states of conduction band ( three - dimensional case ) at any disorder level and becomes also valid in the case of flat band ( two - dimensional case ) in the limit of strong enough disorder .",
    "ginzburg  landau ( gl ) expansion in the region of bcs  bec crossover was derived in a number of previous papers [ ] , however no effects of disorder scattering on gl  expansion coefficients was considered . here",
    "we derive the microscopic coefficients of ( homogeneous ) gl ",
    "expansion for the attractive hubbard model and study disorder effects on these coefficients including the bcs  bec and strong coupling regions , as well as upon the specific heat discontinuity at superconducting transition , demonstrating certain universality of disorder behavior of these characteristics ..",
    "we consider the disordered attractive hubbard model with hamiltonian : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is transfer integral between the nearest neighbors and @xmath1 is onsite hubbard attraction , @xmath8 is electron number operator at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath12 .",
    "local energy levels @xmath13 are assumed to be independent random variables on different lattice sites .",
    "we assume the gaussian distribution of @xmath13 at each site for the validity of the standard `` impurity '' scattering diagram technique [ ] : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the measure of disorder scattering .    the generalized dmft+@xmath0 approach [ ] supplies the standard dmft [ ] with an additional `` external '' self - energy ( in general case momentum dependent ) due to any interaction outside the dmft , which provides an effective method to calculate both single and two  particle properties [ ] .",
    "the additive form of the total self - energy conserves the structure of self  consistent equations of dmft [ ] . the `` external '' self - energy is recalculated at each step of the standard dmft iteration scheme , using some approximations , corresponding to the form of an additional interaction , while the local green s function ( central for dmft ) is also `` dressed '' by additional interaction .    for disordered hubbard model",
    "we take the `` external '' self - energy entering dmft+@xmath0 cycle in the simplest form of self  consistent born approximation , neglecting the `` crossing '' diagrams due to disorder scattering : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the complete single  particle green s function .    to solve the effective anderson impurity model of dmft here we used the effective algorithm of numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) [ ] .    in the following , we consider the model of the `` bare '' conduction band with semi  elliptic density of states ( per unit cell and spin projection ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 determines the half  width of conduction band .",
    "this is a good approximation for the three  dimensional case .    in ref .",
    "[ ] we have shown analytically , that in dmft+@xmath0 approach , within these approximations , all the disorder influence upon single  particle properties is reduced to the simple effect of band widening by disorder scattering , so that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the effective band half  width in the presence of disorder ( in the absence of correlations , i.e. for @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 and conduction band density of states ( in the absence of @xmath1 ) `` dressed '' by disorder is given by : @xmath24 conserving its semi ",
    "elliptic form .    for other models of the `` bare '' conduction band density of states ,",
    "besides band widening , disorder scattering changes the form of the density of states , so that the complete universality of disorder influence of single  particle properties , strictly speaking , is absent . however , in the limit of strong enough disorder the `` bare '' band density effectively becomes elliptic for any reasonable model , so that universality is restored [ ] .    all calculation below were performed for the quarter  filled band ( n=0.5 per lattice site ) .",
    "the critical temperature of superconducting transition @xmath4 in attractive hubbard model was analyzed using direct dmft calculations a number of papers [ ] . in ref .",
    "[ ] we have determined @xmath4 from instability condition of the normal phase ( instability of dmft iteration procedure ) .",

    "this allows us to find both @xmath4 and gl  expansion coefficients in the wide range of parameters of the model , including the bcs  bec crossover region and the limit of strong coupling , for different disorder levels .",
    "actually , this is the essence of nozieres  schmitt - rink approximation  in the weak coupling region transition temperature is controlled by the equation for cooper instability , while in the strong coupling limit it is defined as the temperature of bose condensation , which is controlled by the equation for chemical potential .",

    "coefficient @xmath2 from weak coupling region via the bcs  bec crossover towards the strong coupling .    for @xmath53",
    "the coefficient @xmath54 is written as : @xmath55 where in case of temperature independent chemical potential @xmath56 in bcs approximation with conduction band of infinite width with constant density of states @xmath57 we obtain from ( [ aa2 ] ) the standard result @xmath58 [ ] .",

    "( [ a_end ] ) it is clear that disorder scattering influences @xmath60 only through the changes of the density of states @xmath61 and chemical potential @xmath59 , which is the typical single  particle property .",
    "thus , in the case of semi ",
    "elliptic `` bare '' conduction band the dependence of @xmath60 on disorder is due only to the band widening by disorder replacing @xmath20 .",
    "thus , in the presence of disorder we expect the universal dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath63 ( all energies are to be normalized by the effective bandwidth @xmath64 ) , which will be confirmed by the results of direct numerical computations in the next section ( cf .",
