    "the amount of luminous matter ( stars and gas ) in many spiral and irregular galaxies is not sufficient to explain the amplitude and shape of their rotation curves ( rcs ) .",
    "this discrepancy is usually interpreted as evidence for the presence of an extended dark matter ( dm ) halo surrounding the visible regions of galaxies ( e.g. , casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; persic , salucci , & stel 1996 , and references therein ) .",

    "however , the dynamical contribution of the dark matter can be substantial even in the very inner regions of galaxies : the observed rotation velocities of some dwarf and low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies imply that dm constitutes a dominant fraction ( up to @xmath6 ) of dynamical mass within the last measured point of their rcs ( e.g. , carignan & freeman 1988 ; martimbeau , carignan , & roy 1994 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "these _ dark matter dominated galaxies _ offer a unique opportunity for probing _ directly _ the density structure of dm halos which can be then compared with predictions of theoretical models .",
    "the detailed structure of dm halos formed via dissipationless hierarchical collapse in cdm - like models was recently studied using high - resolution @xmath7-body simulations ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw96 and nfw97 ) .",
    "the halo density profiles were found to be cuspy ( coreless ) and well fitted by the following two - parameter profile ( nfw96 ) : @xmath8 the characteristic density , @xmath9 , and radius , @xmath10 , are sensitive to the epoch of halo formation and are tightly correlated with the halo virial mass ( nfw 96,97 ) .",
    "therefore , the results of these simulations suggest a coreless and self - similar density structure of dm halos , with the virial mass being the single scaling parameter .",

    "we have compiled a sample of 10 dwarf and 7 lsb galaxies with measured rotation curves and published mass models for stellar , gas , and halo components ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the dwarf galaxies were selected from different sources , whereas all 7 lsb galaxies were selected from the sample of de blok , mcgaugh , & van der hulst ( 1996 ) ( see table 1 ) .    in our sample",
    "we included only those galaxies in which the dark matter component was shown to constitute @xmath15% of the total mass inside the last measured point of the rotation curve ( in most cases with the maximum disk assumption ) .",
    "it is important to note that distances to all of the dwarf , and some of the nearby lsb , galaxies are quite uncertain ( in some cases by a factor of two ) .",
    "while rotational velocity is a directly observable quantity , the physical scale of rotation curves must be computed from the angular scale using distance .",
    "thus , any uncertainty in the distance propagates into uncertainty in the physical scale .",
    "this fact should be kept in mind when one makes a one - to - one comparison of observed and modeled rotation curves .",
    "the distances to the galaxies adopted in our analysis are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have adopted the best estimate of distance from the original paper , when it was available , or the distance quoted in tully ( 1988 ) .",
    "we have also included in table 1 the best fit values of mass model parameters described in  2.2 .",
    "analysis of the dark matter distribution is difficult in most galaxies due to ambiguities in the estimates of the stellar mass - to - light ( @xmath16 ) ratios and the resulting dynamical contribution of the stellar component to the observed rotation velocities ( e.g. , de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; bottema 1997 ; courteau & rix 1997 ; and references therein ) .",
    "however , the rotation curves of the galaxies in our sample are mostly determined by dark matter on scales @xmath17 kpc : the contribution from the gas and stars is negligible and residuals between the observed rotation curves and contribution of dm are at the level of the observational scatter of rotational velocities .",
    "therefore , the dark matter distribution models can be directly fitted to the rotation curves of these galaxies without uncertain assumptions about @xmath16 ratios .    b95 showed that the density distribution , @xmath18 , described by equation ( 2 ) fits the data very well over the entire observed range of scales .",
    "at large radii this profile falls off as @xmath19 , in accord with simulations of the cdm model ( e.g. , nfw96 ) .",
    "however , the change of logarithmic slope at @xmath20 predicted by @xmath21 , equation ( 2 ) , is faster than the change predicted by @xmath22 , equation ( 1 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 has a flat core at small radii ( @xmath23 ) , in disagreement with the @xmath24 central cusp of @xmath22 . for dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the scale at which the density distribution is expected to become flat is quite small ( @xmath25 kpc ) and is in fact below the current observational resolution . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the existence of a core is difficult to understand because hierarchical formation of halos is much more likely to result in cuspy central density distributions ( syer & white 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , we will consider the broader family of density profiles ( zhao 1996 ) : @xmath26^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha}}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 characterizes the sharpness of the change in logarithmic slope .",
    "this family includes both cuspy profiles of the type proposed by nfw96 @xmath30 and the so - called modified isothermal profile @xmath31 , which is the most widely used model for the halo density distribution in analyses of observed rotation curves .",
    "it is also convenient to make direct fits with an analytic model similar to ( 3 ) for the velocity profile : @xmath32^{(g+b)/a}},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the effective `` turnover '' radius and velocity and @xmath35 parameterizes the sharpness of the turnover .",
    "the limiting behaviors are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the peak of the velocity profile ( 4 ) occurs at the radius @xmath38 , and @xmath39^{-(b+g)/a}$ ] .",
    "the existing rotation curve measurements , due to their finite resolution and extent , can not be used to constrain all five parameters of the profiles ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "the inner radii of the observational rotation curves are well probed , so we can make a meaningful comparison with fitting functions having different inner density profiles @xmath40 .",
    "however , most of the galaxies in our sample have rotation curves that have not begun to decline at the outermost measured point and thus have very little information about the asymptotic slopes @xmath41 , @xmath42 . given the uncertainties ,",
    "we fix the outer logarithmic slope to the value suggested by the models for large @xmath43 , which has an approximate slope of @xmath44 for values of r near a typical virial radius . ] ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : @xmath45 , @xmath46 . note , however , that as was noted by burkert ( 1995 ) this value is also favored ( to @xmath47 of the pseudo - isothermal profile ) by _ observed _ highest quality rotation curves of dwarf galaxies .",
    "for the same reason , the sharpness of the turnover , @xmath29 or @xmath35 , are not constrained for all of the galaxies .",
    "however , a fair number of galaxies in the sample do show the turnover and thus can be used to constrain @xmath29 .",
    "the plausible value of the parameter @xmath48 was determined using rotation curves of these galaxies .",
    "we generalize this value to all of the galaxies ( which in no way contradicts the data , but is not , of course , a strict procedure ) and thus currently we can only talk about a plausible range of @xmath29 values as a `` universal fit '' ( if any such universal value exist at all ) .",
    "for example , our results will not change drastically if we use @xmath49 instead of @xmath48 .",
    "however , @xmath50 gives a poorer fit to the data .",
    "we fix the parameter @xmath40 to @xmath51 : the value which best fits most of the observed rotation curves .",
    "the corresponding best - fit slopes of the profile ( 4 ) are @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath53 . with parameters",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 @xmath54 fixed , we fitted the data for the remaining free parameters of the profile ( 3 ) : @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( @xmath34 and @xmath33 in eq.[4 ] ) .",
    "our fits thus have the same number of free parameters as do profiles ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "note that while the particular set of the parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath41 , @xmath40)@xmath57 used in the paper did nt result from a strict fitting procedure , it was motivated by all possible constraints of available data .",

    "the rotation curves for different dwarf _ and _ lsb galaxies have virtually identical shapes , which is very well matched over the entire observed range of scales by the analytic model .",

    "the rotation curves of the two dwarf galaxies , ddo154 and ngc2915 , can not be described by a smooth density distribution model in their outer parts .",
    "the rc of ddo154 shows a decrease in rotational velocity in the three outermost observed points .",
    "conversely , the rc of ngc2915 has a sharp upturn at @xmath64 kpc ( or @xmath65 ) .",
    "this upturn can be seen in figure 2 .",
    "the explanation of this peculiar behavior is not clear ( see , however , burkert & silk 1997 ) , but it is obvious that it can not be explained by any smooth model for the mass distribution .",
    "note , however , that apart from the peculiar outer regions , the rotation curves of both ddo154 and ngc2915 have the same shape as the rest of the galaxies .",
    "the shape of the galaxies rotation curves is well matched by the rotation curve corresponding to density profile ( 3 ) with @xmath59 or correspondingly to rc ( 4 ) with @xmath66 .",
    "this result is in perfect agreement with burkert ( 1995 ) who showed similarity of rotation curves for four dwarf galaxies ( two of which , ddo154 and ddo170 , were included in our sample ) .",
    "as was mentioned above , the similar fit by @xmath67 ( eq . [ 2 ] ) proposed by burkert ( 1995 ) is equally good .",
    "note , however , that our profile does not have any flat core , whereas @xmath67 predicts such a core at @xmath68 . the fact that both profiles fit the data equally",
    "well is easy to understand if we notice that @xmath67 predicts a flat density distribution at the scales well below the observational resolution ( @xmath25 kpc ) .",
    "thus , @xmath67 and profile ( 3 ) can be virtually identical in the range of scales resolved in observations and thus provide an equally good fit to the data .",
    "figure 1b shows that the rotation curves of dark matter dominated lsb galaxies are also well described by the _",
    "same _ analytic density profile .",
    "the larger amplitude of scatter in the case of lsb galaxies can be explained by the larger observational errors associated with a given point of a rotation curve and thus most likely reflects observational uncertainties rather than intrinsic scatter of the halo properties .",
    "most of the lsb galaxies in our sample are located at considerably larger distances than dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore , the dwarf galaxies have been observed with considerably higher resolution and smaller observational errors than lsb galaxies .",
    "the estimated errors are typically @xmath69 ( de blok et al .",
    "1996 ) , especially in the inner regions of galaxies ( @xmath70 kpc ) .",
    "one important issue is whether subtraction of baryon component ( stars and gas ) in the galaxies from our sample will affect results of the rotation curve analysis presented above .",
    "as we mentioned in  2.1 , the combined contribution of stars and gas is @xmath71 for all of our galaxies ( @xmath72 in most cases ) .",
    "it is clear that ideally one has to subtract contributions of both gas and stars from the observed rc in order to get the mass distribution of the dark matter to an accuracy of better than 10% .",
    "however , it is well known that this is not an easy thing to do . for stars , the exact mass - to - light ratio is not known and we can not convert visible flux into the stellar mass without making additional assumptions ( hence , `` maximum disk controversy '' ) . in the case of gas , we know exactly how to convert the 21-cm flux into the mass of gas ( no mass - to - light uncertainty ) .",
    "this conversion , however , relies on other assumptions which can easily lead to uncertainties as high as 10% in the contribution of gas .",
    "for example , we need to know distance to the galaxy in order to make this conversion .",
    "we also need to have a reliable way to estimate the profile of molecular gas to recover the dark matter density profile .",
    "the distances to the dwarf galaxies in our sample are _ very _ uncertain ( often by a factor of two or more ) and so is the conversion .",
    "it is not clear whether it makes any sense to subtract the gas with uncertainties of its contribution this big .",
    "after all , the motivation for use of dark matter dominated galaxies for this kind of analysis is to avoid dubious or uncertain correction procedures which are very unlikely to result in a better determination of the shape of dm density distribution .",
    "the distance uncertainty is not so severe for lsb galaxies and so conversion could , in principle , have been done in this case .",
    "we have not done this for one simple reason : subtraction of the gas component could change any given point of rotation curve by at most @xmath73 ( in practice less than that ) .",
    "however , the errors associated with each point of rc are of the order of @xmath69 ( which combine both observational errors and assymetries in the rotation curves between receding and approaching sides ) and it seems unlikely that correction due to gas subtraction would improve or systematically change the answer ( unless the observational errors are significantly overestimated ) .",
    "we have tested the effect of gas subtraction on the rc shapes by performing rc shape analysis for two galaxies ( dwarf ngc 5585 and lsb f@xmath74 ) with and without subtraction of gas .",
    "the two galaxies have been selected to have a clearly visible turnover of the rc and to have a fairly high fraction of gas inside the last measured point of the rotation curve .",
    "this fraction is 8% for ngc 5585",
    "( cte et al . 1991 ) and 5% for f@xmath74",
    "( de blok et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the results of fitting the ( @xmath29 , @xmath41 , @xmath40)@xmath75 model to the rc with and without gas subtraction result in very similar results : the difference in the best fit parameters is @xmath76 and corrected and uncorrected rcs have virtually identical shape .",
    "note also that the dwarf galaxies that we used have on average a higher ( or at least as high ) fraction of gas ( typically @xmath77 ) than lsb galaxies ( typically @xmath78 ) .",
    "therefore , if gas would introduce systematic differences in the shape of rc , we could expect that the scatter in figure 1 to be larger for dwarf galaxies ( some galaxies have much more gas than the others ) .",
    "yet , the shape of rotation curves for dwarf galaxies is very uniform .",
    "we have repeated the fitting procedure described above using the analytic profiles ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . as was mentioned above , @xmath67 results in a fit that is equally good to the fit by profile ( 3 ) shown in figure 1 . however , the analytic profile proposed by nfw failed to produce a reasonable fit to the data , as was indeed pointed out in nfw96 ( see their fig.12 ) .",
    "the major difficulty with this profile , as was noted before by flores & primack 1994 and b95 , is that the inner slope of the density distribution ( @xmath79 ) is considerably steeper than implied by the rotation curves .",
    "the finite spatial extent of the data and incorrect inner slope of the profile ( 1 ) lead to implausible solutions of the @xmath80-minimization procedure ( the values of @xmath10 increase without convergence ) .",
    "the observed similarity of the shapes of the rotation curves for seventeen different galaxies , selected solely on the basis of their dark matter content , and the remarkably small amount of scatter , implies that their matter distributions are _ self - similar _ in terms of the density structure .",
    "of course , this includes both stellar and gaseous matter as well as dm .",
    "both stellar and gaseous masses are uncertain because of uncertainties in the distance , mass - to - light ratio , and atomic - to - molecular gas ratio of each galaxy . to the extent that we can neglect the stellar and gaseous components ( a subject that we intend to address in a subsequent paper ) ,",
    "the self - similar rotation curves of these dm - dominated galaxies imply that they all have the same density structure .",
    "the question we now ask is whether the disagreement between this density structure and @xmath81 indicates a failure of cdm - type models ?",

    "however , the difference decreases with decreasing halo mass and for @xmath130 m@xmath120 the density profiles from the two runs are identical within statistical noise at scales larger than one resolution element .",

    "however , if we fix @xmath48 and @xmath45 we can attempt to find the best - fitting ranges of @xmath40 for each of our simulated models .",
    "the procedure for finding best - fit gamma values for the halos is not entirely straightforward since , depending on the the mass of the halo ( and intrinsic scatter ) , the characteristic scale @xmath210 , may be as small as the resolution limit , and the inner - slope will be poorly constrained .",

    "the most important conclusion evident from the results presented in the previous section is that there is _ no statistically significant discrepancy between the shapes of rotation curves of simulated halos and rotation curve shapes of galaxies in our sample_. this conclusion is somewhat surprising in light of the previous results ( flores & primack 94 ; moore 1994 ; nfw96 ) that indicated a significant discrepancy between numerical simulations and rotation curve measurements .",
    "we see at least two possible explanations for the controversy .",
    "first , both moore ( 1994 ) and nfw neglected the fact that distances to these galaxies ( and thus the physical scales of the rotation curves ) are very poorly determined ( with a typical error of @xmath217% or more ; l. van zee , private communication ) . with a distance uncertainty this large , it is hardly legitimate to make a raw comparison of the profiles at a specific physical distance scale .",
    "the comparison between rotation curves of dwarf galaxies and different analytic models was made by b95 .",
    "the comparison was made , however , in units of @xmath218 ( see eq.(2 ) ) , in which case the uncertainty in distance in both @xmath43 and @xmath14 cancels out in the ratio ( the same is true for our analysis that was done in units of @xmath193 ) .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy between the analytic model ( 1 ) and the data ( fig.1 in b95 ) was not as large as was found by moore ( 1994 ) .",
    "note that the study by flores & primack ( 1994 ) was also done using dimensionless scale units : @xmath219 , where @xmath43 is the physical scale of the rotation curves and @xmath220 is the @xmath221 disk scale length .",
    "the key point is that the rotation curve _ shape _ is independent of the uncertain distance to the galaxy .",
    "the second possible source of discrepancy concerns the procedure followed to compare the numerical results with observations .",
    "when comparing to the rc data , we have used @xmath222 fit ( motivated by the observed galaxies rcs ; see fig.1 ) only to determine @xmath56 and @xmath58 for the inner halo rcs ( i.e. , @xmath223 kpc ) so that these can be properly rescaled and compared to the dwarf rcs in fig .",
    "other authors compare the data to a simple analytic fit to the entire halo profile ( i.e. , @xmath224 ) , e.g. @xmath225 .",

    "possible systematic deviations ( especially in the inner , @xmath226 , regions ) of the actual profiles from the analytic model ( 1 ) should be kept in mind .",

    "figure 6 in nfw96 and figure 4 in nfw97 show that similar deviations seem to exist in their simulations as well .",
    "it was suggested ( j. navarro , private communication ) that the inner density distribution may depend on the dynamical state of the halo : the most relaxed halos may have systematically steeper inner density profiles .",
    "we do not find such a trend for the halos analyzed in this paper . there does not seem to exist any correlation of the inner slope of the density profiles or the concentration parameter , @xmath229 , with the dynamical state of the halo quantified by the fractional difference between the center of mass inside the halo virial radius and the halo center ( the density peak ) : @xmath230",
    ". however , if a weak correlation does exist , it could be lost due to the rather large errors in determining @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) for small halos ( @xmath233 m@xmath138 ) .",

    "thus , for example , the average velocity profiles of halos shown in figure 2 are very close to the observational points , whereas the upper @xmath194-envelopes ( the dotted lines ) lie considerably higher in the inner regions of the rotation curves .",
    "the discrepancy between the analytic model of nfw and the data found by b95 is actually within @xmath234 from our average halo profiles .",
    "the scatter is not caused by poisson noise : the halo rotation curves contain @xmath198 particles inside the innermost bin used in the fitting .",
    "there are different possible sources of this scatter .",
    "the set of parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath41 , @xmath40)@xmath57 , used to make a sensible comparison between data and models in the @xmath235 plane may not be the best description of the mass distribution in the simulated halos .",
    "however , our analysis shows that the true source is probably real differences between mass distributions of different halos .",
    "for example , when we allow parameter @xmath29 vary freely with other parameters fixed to @xmath236 and @xmath45 , this results in a wide range of best fit values for @xmath29 ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "also , the density distribution in the inner regions varies substantially from halo to halo : the density profiles of some halos are considerably steeper than profiles of the others .",
    "we can thus talk only about `` approximate universality '' of the profiles and some amount of scatter will be introduced with any fixed set of parameters .",
    "regardless of the nature of this scatter , it should not be neglected when making comparisons with the data . and",

    "we showed that mass distribution in the lsb galaxies is , in fact , very similar to the mass distribution of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "this makes it even harder to explain such regularity with this mechanism alone , because many of the lsb galaxies are fairly massive systems which are unlikely to have lost much of their gas in starbursts .",
    "recently , burkert & silk ( 1997 ) used an improved rotation curve measurement of the dwarf ddo154 to argue that discrepancy between the nfw profile and the observed mass distribution in this galaxy can be explained by a dark spheroid of baryons with mass several times the mass of the observed disk and comparable to the mass of the cold dark matter halo .",
    "this hypothesis must be tested using other galaxies and observations of the machos in our galaxy that constitute the main observational evidence for the existence of such massive baryonic halos .",
    "the observed self - similarity of the mass distribution in the dark matter dominated galaxies which we analyze requires that the distribution of the baryonic dark matter be self - similar too and suggests a certain degree of `` conspiracy '' between baryonic dm and cold dm halos .",
    "the results presented in this paper show that the mass distribution in our hierarchically formed cold dark matter halos is consistent with the dynamics of the dark matter dominated galaxies and we think that it is somewhat premature to invoke an additional dark matter component . however , if further results on the distribution of machos shows that the mass contribution of these objects is substantial , the possibility of such a component must be taken into account . note also that , as we discussed in  2.2 , the rotation curves of two of the dwarf galaxies , ddo154 and ngc2915 , show a peculiar behavior at large radii that can not be described by any smooth model of density distribution .",
    "to summarize , our results are the following .",
    "* rotation curves of dm dominated dwarf and lsb galaxies have a similar shape .",
    "this shape is inconsistent with @xmath225 ( eq . [ 1 ] ) , but is well fit by the coreless profile described by eq .",
    "( 3 ) which has a shallower slope at small scales : @xmath255 , corresponding to a steeply rising velocity curve @xmath256 $ ] . *",
    "we find that _ on average _ the velocity profiles of the halos formed in the hierarchical structure formation models analyzed in this paper ( cdm , @xmath2cdm , and chdm ) and observed dark matter halos are in reasonably good agreement .",
    "we find a substantial amount of scatter in the central density profiles of individual halos around the average .",
    "the physical processes which lead to differences in the central density profiles seen in our halos ( e.g. , environment , dynamical state , etc . ) are not clear and will be the subject of a future study . *",
    "the inner ( @xmath257 kpc ) average density profiles of dm halos in all of our simulations are well fit by model ( 3 ) with ( @xmath29 , @xmath41 , @xmath40)@xmath200(2,3,0.2 ) , and equivalently the rotation curves are well described by rc ( 4 ) with @xmath66 .",
    "the profiles systematically deviate from the nfw profile ( 1 ) at small scales . *",
    "we find that dark matter dominated dwarf and lsb galaxies show correlations between their characteristic density and radius consistent with the correlations of hierarchically formed dm halos : physically smaller halos are denser .",
    "we find a similar correlation between the maximum of the rotation curve , @xmath185 , and the corresponding radius @xmath186 .",
    "we would like to thank erwin de blok and liese van zee for sending us rotation curves in the electronic form .",

    "<S> we use the rotation curves of a sample of dark matter dominated dwarf and low - surface brightness ( lsb ) late - type galaxies to study their radial mass distributions . </S>",

    "<S> we further show that the observed shapes of the rotation curves are well matched by the average density profiles of dark matter halos formed in very high resolution simulations of the standard cold dark matter model ( cdm ) , the low - density cdm model with cosmological constant ( @xmath2cdm ) , and the cold@xmath3hot dark matter model with two types of neutrino ( chdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising in light of several previous studies , which suggested that the structure of simulated dark matter halos is inconsistent with the dynamics of dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy and show that it is most likely due to the systematic differences at small radii between the analytic model proposed by navarro , frenk , & white , with @xmath4 , and the actual central density profiles of the dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the mass distributions in the hierarchically formed halos are _ on average _ consistent with the shape of rotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the scatter of the individual profiles around the average is substantial . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the dark matter halos in our hierarchical simulations and the real galaxies in our sample exhibit a similar decrease in their characteristic densities with increasing characteristic radial scales and show increase in their maximum rotation velocities with increase in the radii at which their maximum velocities occur . </S>"
