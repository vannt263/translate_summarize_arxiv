    "towards the later half of the 16th century , the renaissance of greek civilization in europe had paved the way for major advancements leading to the creation of modern science . in astronomy , the heliocentric theory of copernicus and the systematic astronomical observational data of tycho de brahe led to the discovery of the magnificent empirical laws of kepler on planetary motions . in physics , the empirical laws of galileo on terrestrial gravity ( i.e. free falling bodies and motions on inclined planes ) laid the modern foundation of mechanics .",
    "then , in the later half of the 17th century , the mathematical synthesis of those empirical laws led isaac newton ( 16431727 ) to the discovery of the law of universal gravitation , published in his monumental treatise _ philosophiae naturalis principia mathematicae  ( 1687 ) , _ divided into three books , often referred to as _ _ _ principia _ for brevity .",
    "note that , at this junction of scientific  advancements , it is the mathematical analysis as well as the synthesis of empirical laws that play the unique role leading towards the underlying fundamental laws . among them ,",
    "the first major step is the deduction of the inverse square law from kepler s area law and ellipse law , which was first achieved by newton most likely sometimes in 168081 , and another most crucial step is the proof of the integration formula for the gravitation attraction of spherically symmetric bodies , nowadays often referred to as the superb theorem . in _",
    "principia _ , these major results are respectively stated as proposition 11 and proposition 71 of book i , where newton deals with the laws of motion in vacuum .    certainly , newton s celebrated treatise is widely worshipped also today . however , his proofs of the two most crucial propositions are quite difficult to understand , even among university graduates .",
    "therefore , a major goal of this article is to provide elementary and clean - cut proofs of these results .    in the prelude we shall briefly recall the major historical events and the central figures contributing to the gradual understanding of planetary motions prior to newton .",
    "moreover , the significance of the area law is analyzed in the spirit of newton s , but in modern terms of classical mechanics , for the convenience of the reader .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a review of the focal and analytic geometry of the ellipse , the type of curves playing such a predominant role in the work of kepler and newton .",
    "of particular interest is the curvature formula , which newton must have known , but for some reason appears only implicitly in his proof of the inverse square law . in section 4",
    "we shall give three simple different proofs of this law , allowing the modern reader to view newton s original and rather obscure proof with modern critical eyes .",
    "moreover , newton s original and geometric proof of his superb theorem  is not easy reading , which maybe explains the occurrence of many new proofs in the more recent literature .",
    "we believe , however , the proof given in section 5 is the simplest one , in the spirit of newton s proof but based on one single new geometric idea .",
    "finally , for the sake of completeness , in section 6 we shall solve what is called the kepler problem in the modern terminology , but was in fact referred to as the inverse problem  at the time of newton and some time after , see @xcite .",
    "we present two proofs , one of them is rather of standard type , reducing the integration to the solution of binet s equation , which in this case is a well known and simple second order ode in elementary calculus with @xmath0 and @xmath1 as solutions .",
    "but there is an even simpler proof , where the integration problem is just finding the antiderivatives of these two functions .",
    "one may contend that `` simple '' proofs of the above classical problems are nowadays found in a variety of calculus textbooks or elsewhere , so is there anything new at all ?",
    "the original motivation for the present article came , however , from reading chandrasekhar [ 3 ] , which encouraged us to write a rather short but coherent presentation accessible for the `` common reader '' , in a historical perspective and in the spirit of newton s original approach .",
    "the ancient civilization of egypt and babylon had already accumulated a wealth of astronomical and geometric knowledges that those great minds of greek civilization such as thales ( ca .",
    "624547 bc ) , pythagoras ( ca .",
    "569475 bc ) etc .",
    "gladly inherited , studied and deeply reflected upon . in particular",
    ", pythagoras pioneered the philosophical belief that the basic structures of the universe are harmonious and based upon simple fundamental principles , while the way to understand them is by studying numbers , ratios , and shapes .",
    "ever since then , his remarkable philosophical foresight still inspires generations after generations of rational minds .",
    "following such a pioneering philosophy , the pythagoreans devoted their studies to geometry and astronomy and subsequently , geometry and astronomy became the two major sciences of the antiquity , developing hand in hand .",
    "for example , those great geometers of antiquity such as eudoxus ( 408355 bc ) , archimedes ( 287212 bc ) , and apollonius ( ca .",
    "262190 bc ) , all had important contributions to astronomy , while those great astronomers of antiquity such as aristarchus(ca .",
    "310230 bc ) , hipparchus(190120 bc ) , and ptolemy(ca .",
    "85165 ad ) all had excellent geometric expertise .",
    "we mention here three well - known treatises that can be regarded as the embodiment of the glory of scientific achievements of the antiquity , namely    * euclid s _ elements _ ( 13 books ) * apollonius : _ conics _ ( 8 books ) * ptolemy : _ almagest _ ( 13 books )      today , it is a common knowledge that the earth is just one of the planets circulating around the sun .",
    "but this common knowledge was , in fact , the monumental achievement of the new astronomy , culminating the successive life - long devotions of copernicus ( 14731543 ) , tycho de brahe ( 15461601 ) , and kepler ( 15711630 ) .",
    "kepler finally succeeded in solving the problem on planetary motions ( see below ) that had been puzzling the civilization of rational mind for many millenniums .    in the era of the renaissance , euclid s",
    "_ elements _ and ptolemy s _ almagest _ were used as important text books on geometry and astronomy at major european universities . at bologna university , copernicus studied deeply ptolemy s _ almagest _ as an assistant of astronomy professor navara , and both of them were aware of _ almagest _",
    "s many shortcomings and troublesome complexities .",
    "in 1514 , inspired by the account of archimedes on the heliocentric theory of aristarchus , he composed his decisive _ commentary _ @xmath2 , outlining his own heliocentric theory which was finally completed as the book _ de revolutionibus orbium coelestium _",
    "( 1543)_. _ nowadays , this is commonly regarded as the heralding salvo of the modern scientific revolution .",
    "note that a creditable astronomical theory must pass the test of accurate predictions of verifiable astronomical events , such as observable events on planetary motions .",
    "however , just a qualitatively sound heliocentric model of the solar system would hardly be accepted as a well - established theory of astronomy .",
    "fortunately , almost like a divinely arranged relay in astronomy , the most diligent astronomical observer tycho de brahe , with generous financial help from the king of denmark and norway , made twenty years of superb astronomical observations at uraniborg on the island of hven , and subsequently , johannes kepler became his assistant ( 16001601 ) , and moreover , succeeded him as imperial mathematician ( of the holy roman empire , in prague ) after the sudden death of tycho de brahe .",
    "with kepler s superb mathematical expertise and marvelous creativity , it took him 20 years of hard work and devotion to finally succeed in solving the millennium puzzle of planetary motions , namely the following remarkable kepler s laws , which we may state as follows :       ( the ellipse law ) : the planets move on elliptical orbits with the sun situated at one of the foci .",
    "( the area law ) : the area per unit time sweeping across by the line interval joining the planet to the sun is a constant , as illustrated by figure [ f1 ] .    ( the period law ) : the ratio between the cube of the major axis and the square of the period , namely @xmath3 , is the same constant for all planets .",
    "f:/keplernewtonhooke / figures / figure1.jpg    the following are the major publications of kepler on his new astronomy :    * astronomia nova ( 1609 ) * 3 volumes of epitome of copernican astronomy ( 1618 - 1621 ) * harmonice mundi ( 1619 ) * tabulae rudolphinae ( 1627 )    first of all , the predictions of the rudolphine tables turned out to be hundred times more accurate than that of the others . moreover , kepler predicted the mercury transit of nov . 7 , 1631 ( which was observed in paris by p. gassendi ) , and the venus transit of dec . 7 , 1631 ( that could not be observed in europe ) , while the next venus transit would only occur after another 130 years .",
    "here , we would like to mention the remarkable achievements of j. horrocks ( 16181641 ) .",
    "this brilliant young man was already fully in command of kepler s new astronomy at the age of 20 , and after _ correcting _ kepler s tables , he realized that a transit of venus would occur already on nov .",
    "24 , 1639 .",
    "his subsequent observation on the predicted date , which he reported in _ venus in sole visa _ , was found in 1659 , and this is a noticeable triumph of the new astronomy .      during his years at the university of pisa ( 158992 ) , galileo galilei ( 15641642 ) wrote _ de motu , _ a series of essays on the theory of motion ( containing some mistakes , but was never published ) .",
    "perhaps his most important new idea in _ de motu _ is that one can test theories by conducting experiments , such as testing his theory on falling bodies using an inclined plane to vary the rate of descent .    in the years 160204 at padua",
    ", he had returned to the dynamical study of terrestrial gravity by conducting experiments on the inclined plane and the pendulum .",
    "he had , by then , formulated the correct law of falling bodies and worked out that a projectile follows a parabolic path .",
    "however , these important results that laid the foundation of modern mechanics were only published 35 years later in _ discourses and mathematical demonstrations concerning the two new sciences_. here one finds the origin of the law of inertia , in the sense that galileo s conception of inertia is tantamount to _",
    "newton s first law _ of motion .",
    "furthermore , galileo s experiments on falling bodies pointed toward the general force law ( i.e. @xmath4 ) , namely _",
    "newton s second law _ , which was certainly",
    "also known to newton s contemporaries huygens , halley , and hooke .",
    "however , the notion of `` force '' was , to some extent , already present in the work of archimedes on statics . on the other other hand , _",
    "newton s third law _",
    "concerning mutually interacting forces , was a major innovation due to himself , which we shall return to in section 7 .",
    "according to b. cohen ( cf .",
    "@xcite , pp.167169 ) , a decisive step on the path to universal gravity came in late 1679 and early 1680 , when robert hooke ( 1635 - 1703 ) introduced newton to a new way of analyzing motion along a curved trajectory , cf .",
    "koyr @xcite .",
    "hooke had cleverly seen that the motion of an arbitrary body can be regarded as the combination of an inertia component and a centripetal component .",
    "but he was unable to express this in a more precise mathematical language .",
    "however , the possible influence of hooke on newton s _ principia _ still engages many scientists and historians , cf .",
    "e.g. purrington @xcite",
    ".    the terms centripetal force  and radial force  will be used interchangeably.the very first proposition of the _ principia _ develops the dynamical significance of the law of areas by proving the mathematical equivalence between the area law and the centripetality of the force , using hooke s technique .",
    "we include here a slight simplification of newton s proof in terms of modern terminology , namely    [ radial]let @xmath5 be the position vector of a point mass at @xmath6 moving in a plane , and let @xmath7 be the area swept out by @xmath5 per unit time .",
    "then @xmath7 is a constant if and only if @xmath5 and the acceleration vector @xmath8 are collinear , namely the force is centripetal .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath9 @xmath10 and the acceleration vector @xmath8 @xmath11 lie in the plane of the motion , with unit normal vector @xmath12 , say . then we can write @xmath13 on the other hand @xmath14 and by differentiating both sides of equation ( [ ang ] ) , we conclude that @xmath7 is a constant if and only if @xmath15 , which simply means @xmath5 and @xmath8 are collinear .    by",
    "( [ ang1 ] ) ,  centripetality of the force acting on @xmath6 means the vector @xmath16 is constant during the motion , and clearly it is also normal to the motion .",
    "in particular , centripetality implies the point moves in a plane .",
    "however , in the above theorem the meaning of area swept out  needs no further explanation since the motion is by assumption confined to a fixed plane .    [ area",

    "angular veclocity_. then the quantity @xmath7 expresses as @xmath21 in particular , for a planet whose trajectory is the ellipse with the sun at the focal point @xmath18 , it follows from kepler s area law that the quantity ( [ 2 ] ) is the constant @xmath22 .",
    "\\(i ) in book 1 of _ principia _ , newton paid much attention to centripetal forces @xmath23 , asking two natural questions , namely ( i ) for a given trajectory curve , what is the attracting force @xmath23 , and conversely , ( ii ) for a given force law such as @xmath24 , what curves are the corresponding trajectories ?",
    "for a few decades the problems were , respectively , referred to as the direct  and inverse  ( kepler ) problem ( cf .",
    "speiser @xcite ) , which is rather peculiar since the terms direct  and inverse  later became switched , and this is also the modern terminology .",

    "we shall illustrate its usage by applying it both to the inverse kepler problem ( in section 4 ) and the kepler problem ( in section 6 ) . for studies of the inverse kepler problem in the physics literature ,",
    "see for example ram@xcite and sivardire@xcite .",
    "in what follows , the notation @xmath26 is used both for the segment between points @xmath6 and @xmath27 and the length of the segment .",
    "in greek geometry , the shape of ellipses first occurred as the tilted plane sections of a circular cylinder , as indicated in figure [ f2 ] , while ellipse  means non - circular  or distorted circle .",
    "however , the discovery of its remarkable geometric characterization greatly excited the enthusiasm of studying such a natural generalization of circular shapes , namely    an ellipse @xmath28 has two foci @xmath29 such that the sum of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is equal to a constant for all points @xmath6 on @xmath28 .    referring to figure [ f2 ] , @xmath32 is a circular cylinder cut by a plane @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the plane section .",

    "then @xmath81    let us begin with a pertinent fact on circular motions which led hooke to grasp the dynamical significance of curvature .",

    ", @xmath83 therefore@xmath84    recall that the osculating circle at a point approximates a ( @xmath85-smooth ) curve up to second order accuracy .",
    "therefore , one can apply the above formula for circular motions to the osculating circle at a point @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the localization of the dynamics on such a curve at @xmath6 is essentially the same as that of a corresponding motion on its osculating circle at @xmath6 , and hence @xmath86 holds in general .",
    "this is the physical meaning of @xmath87 , the normal component of the acceleration .",
    "next , let us use the simple dynamical representation of a given ellipse @xmath28 , namely@xmath88 to compute the curvature of @xmath28 at @xmath6 , as follows : @xmath89 as can be seen from figure [ f3a ] , the area of the parallelogram spanned by @xmath9 and @xmath8 is @xmath90 and combined with ( [ a - normal ] ) one has @xmath91 on the other hand , by corollary 3.4 and figure [ f3a ] , one also has @xmath92 , so @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , by ( [ a.n])@xmath94 and formula ( [ secret ] ) follows immediately from this .",
    "set @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then the equation of the ellipse @xmath28 is given by@xmath97",
    "@xmath98 , and by the cosine law applied to triangle @xmath99@xmath100 and consequently@xmath101 which can be restated as in ( [ ellipse ] ) .",
    "first of all , it follows readily from the area law , namely the quantity in ( [ 2 ] ) is a constant , that the acceleration vector @xmath8 is pointing towards @xmath37 , see theorem [ radial ] .",
    "thus , what remains to prove is that the magnitude of @xmath8 should be inverse proportionate to the square of @xmath70 as a consequence of the ellipse law .",
    "this is the monumental achievement of newton which also led him to the great discovery of the universal gravitation law , see section 7 .",
    "however , his proof ( cf . proposition 11 of @xcite ) is rather difficult to understand .",
    "the following are three much simpler proofs , each uses different aspects of the focal geometry of ellipses discussed in section 3 :       i ( in the spirit of greek geometry )    by the area law and the identity ( [ d1d2])@xmath102 therefore , @xmath103 hence ( see figure [ f3a ] ) , @xmath104 and by remark [ area law ] @xmath105       ii ( using the kinematic formula for curvature the proof hooke sorely missed ? )    by the area law ( remark [ area law]),theorem [ curvature ] , and ( [ a - normal]),@xmath106 and consequently@xmath107    on page 110 of @xcite , s. chandrasekhar states : that newton must have known this relation ( cf .",
    "( [ secret ] ) ) requires no argument!. in fact , a thorough analysis of the proof of proposition 11 in @xcite will reveal that its major portion is devoted to the proof of ( [ secret ] ) , and the inverse square law can then be deduced essentially in the same way as the short simple step of proof ii .",
    "but such a crucial role of curvature in his proof is , somehow , hidden in his presentation .",

    "moreover , assuming the trajectory is an ellipse ( or conic section , but not a circle ) , we need only show that @xmath110 is inverse proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "this will be achieved by differentiation of the polar coordinate equation ( [ ellipse ] ) .    at this point , however , it is instructive to derive the binet equation and apply it to our situation , since the remaining calculations will be similar in both cases . thus , setting @xmath112 as a new variable depending on @xmath113 , straightforward differentiation of @xmath114 and elimination of @xmath115 by introducing the constant @xmath116 yield the identity @xmath117 which is just the binet equation ( [ binet ] ) divided by @xmath118",
    "next , by differentiation of the ellipse equation ( [ ellipse ] ) @xmath119 we deduce the identity @xmath120 which by substitution into ( [ binet2 ] ) yields@xmath121    the proof given by newton in @xcite is historically the _ first proof _ of the inverse square law , a great historical event among the major advances of the civilization of rational mind .",
    "therefore , a careful reading as well as a thorough understanding of the underlying pertinent ideas ( or insights ) of such a proof are , of course , highly desirable and of great significance towards one s understanding of the history of science .",
    "for example , a reading of corresponding sections of @xcite might be helpful for such an undertaking .",
    "if one compares newton s proof and the above triple of proofs , one finds that the _ area law and the focal geometry of ellipses always play the major roles in each proof , while the differentiation of sine and cosine is the only needed analytical computation involved in each proof .",
    "in fact , the main differences between them lie in the ways of proper synthesis between the area law and the focal geometry of ellipses . _",
    "newton s proof ( cf .",
    "proposition 71 in book i of @xcite ) for the following important integration formula , nowadays often referred to as the superb theorem , is again not easy to understand .",

    "see schmid @xcite for a similar but still different geometric proof .",
    "the total gravitation force acting on an outside particle by a body with spherically symmetric mass distribution is equal to that of a point mass of its total mass situated at its center .",
    "first of all , the proof can be directly reduced to the case of a thin spherical shell with a uniform mass density @xmath80 per area .",
    "the key idea of this elementary geometric proof is to use the subdivision of the spherical surface of radius @xmath122  induced by the subdivision of the total solid angle ( i.e. the unit sphere ) centered at @xmath123 on @xmath124 with @xmath125 , as illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "f:/keplernewtonhooke / figures / figure4.jpg    for any given point @xmath27 on the @xmath122-sphere , @xmath126 and @xmath127 have the same angle at @xmath18 , and moreover , their corresponding pairs of sides are in proportion , namely @xmath128 @xmath129@xmath130 therefore , @xmath126 @xmath131 and hence@xmath132    now , let @xmath133 be the element of area on the @xmath122-sphere around @xmath27 and @xmath134 be its corresponding element of area on the unit sphere . then , as indicated in the magnified solid angle cone of @xmath134 in figure 4 , the corresponding area element on the @xmath135 -sphere centered at @xmath123 is equal to @xmath135 @xmath136 on the one hand , but equals @xmath137 on the other hand , because the dihedral angle between the tangent planes of @xmath133 ( resp . @xmath135",

    "\\(i ) newton was undoubtedly aware of the importance of the integration formula for the gravitational force of a spherically symmetric body , both for celestial gravity and for terrestrial gravity , and moreover , for the unification of both , thus enabling him to proclaim the law of universal gravitation .",
    "\\(ii ) in fact , he must have been working hard on it , ever since his success in proving the inverse square law some time in 168081 .",
    "his letter of june 20 , 1686 , to halley recorded his repeated failure up to around 1685 , while his final success , in 1686 , of proving such a wonderful simple formula is actually the crown - jewel of his glorious triumph  the law of universal gravitation ( cf .",

    "for the convenience of the reader , we include here a simple proof on the solution of the kepler problem , as follows :    [ kepler problem]suppose that the acceleration of a motion is centripetal and inverse proportional to the square of @xmath145 , namely for some constant @xmath146,@xmath147 then the motion satisfies the area law and its orbit is a conic section with the center as one of its foci .",

    "however , the proof also works as well for @xmath165 ( i.e. repulsive force ) , which is important in quantum mechanics for studying scattering .",
    "\\(ii ) mathematically , the solution of the kepler problem amounts to solve the second order ode ( [ accel ] ) in terms of the given initial data , especially the uniqueness without  appealing to sophisticated theorems .",
    "our first proof of theorem [ kepler problem ] accomplishes such a task in two simple , elementary steps , namely , firstly obtaining the solution of @xmath166 in terms of the initial velocity by a direct application of the area law ( i.e. consequence of the centripetality ) , and then obtaining the polar coordinate equation of the trajectory by another direct application of the area law .",
    "note that the area law is actually the dynamical manifestation of the rotational symmetry of the plane with respect to the center of the centripetality .",
    "therefore , it is , of course , natural to use the polar coordinate system and compute @xmath167 in the proof .",
    "in retrospect , it is not only the simplest proof with perfect generality and the least of technicality , but it is also the most natural way of solving the kepler problem .",
    "\\(iii ) we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for comparison of proofs of theorem [ kepler problem ] , as well as for the discussions of whether newton actually proved it .",
    "* ( i ) * in book iii of _ principia _ , newton presents his crowning achievements , namely a demonstration of the structure of the system of the world , derived from the basic principles that he had developed in book i and book ii .",
    "newton s three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation are for the first time seen to provide a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena . in particular , they provide the foundation of celestial mechanics , and the first complete mathematical formulation of the classical @xmath168-body problem appears in newton s principia .",
    "the law of universal gravitation is , in fact , the first and also one of the most important scientific discoveries in the entire history of sciences .",
    "an in - depth understanding of how it arises naturally from the mathematical analysis as well as synthesis of those empirical laws of kepler and galilei is not only instructional but also inspirational .      *",
    "( ii ) * the law of universal gravitation reflects the physical principle expounded by newton that all bodies interact gravitationally . but such a statement presupposes a deeper understanding of the force law @xmath169 , namely that two interacting bodies attract each other by equal forces and in opposite directions .",
    "this follows from _",
    "newton s third law _ , which is his own insight , stating that for every action there is an opposite reaction .",
    "in the case of gravitation this interaction is expressed by the basic and well known formula @xmath170 for the mutual gravitation force between two point masses @xmath118 and @xmath171 separated by the distance @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the _ gravitational constant .",
    "_ by newton s superb theorem  ( see section 5 ) , the same formula holds for two bodies with spherically symmetric mass distributions and total masses @xmath118 and @xmath171 , and @xmath172 is the distance between their centers . for many bodies , such as the planets circling the sun , the bodies attract one another and therefore they also perturb one another s orbits .",
    "still , as pointed out by newton , the law of universal gravitation explains why the planets follow kepler s laws approximately and why they depart ( as is also observed ) from the laws in the way they do .",
    "let us briefly recall the underlying reasoning .",
    "first , consider a sun - planet system with masses @xmath171 and @xmath118 , ignoring the other celestial bodies . by combining the force law @xmath4 and formula ( [ gravity ] )",
    ", it may seem that one is led to equation ( [ accel ] ) , with @xmath174 , and thus the planet s orbit will be a solution of the kepler problem as stated in theorem [ kepler problem ] , namely an ellipse with the sun at one of the focal points .",
    "however , this reduction of the sun - planet problem to a one - body ( or kepler ) problem centered at the sun is only approximately correct . as we would phrase it today",
    ", the validity of the newtonian dynamics hinges upon using an inertial frame of reference , namely with the origin at rest .",
    "how did newton himself imagine the origin of an inertial frame could be chosen ?",
    "the sun is much larger than the planets , but newton was aware of the tiny motion of the sun due to the attraction of the planets .",
    "he estimated the center of the world , namely the center of gravity of the whole solar system , to be very close to the sun , say within one solar diameter .",
    "for a general two - body system , the common center of gravity is at rest  if the interaction with other bodies is neglected .",
    "thus , the position of one body determines the position of the other , and newton argues correctly that the two - body problem again reduces to a one - body problem with radial attraction towards the center of gravity .",
    "so , both bodies follow keplerian orbits with the latter point as a common focus .    however , whereas an exact solution of the two - body problem is one of the great triumphs of classical mechanics , the non - integrability of the @xmath168-body problem for @xmath168 @xmath175 , which is well known nowadays , was maybe suspected already by newton when he wrote in his tract _ de motu ( 1684 ) : _  to define these motions by exact laws allowing of convenient calculation exceeds , unless i am mistaken , the force of the entire human intellect .      *",
    "( iii ) * the measurement of the gravitational constant @xmath173 in formula ( [ gravity ] ) has a long history ; in fact , the formulation of gravity in terms of @xmath173 did not become standard until the late 19th century . the first successful experiment in the laboratory , by h. cavendish ( 17311810 ) in 1798 , aimed at measuring the mass @xmath176 of the earth , or equivalently , the ( average ) density @xmath177 of the earth from the knowledge of the earth s radius @xmath122 .",
    "however , knowing the acceleration of gravity @xmath178 at the surface of the earth , measuring @xmath177 amounts to measuring @xmath173 due to the relations @xmath179    the apparatus used by cavendish was actually designed by the geologist j. michell ( 17241793 ) , who was a pioneer in seismology and did also important work in astronomy . although laplace ( 1796 ) is usually credited for being the first who described the concept of a black hole ( condensed star ) , michell argued in a 1784 paper how such an objects could be observed from its gravitational effect on nearby objects .",
    "however , michell is best known for his invention , probably in the early 1780 s , of the torsion balance , which is the major device of the apparatus he built to measure the quantity @xmath177 .",
    "but michell did not complete this project , and his equipment was taken over by cavendish , who rebuilt the apparatus with some improvements , which enabled him to carry out measurements of the density of the earth with very high accuracy .",
    "we refer to his report @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite . the measurement of the universal constant @xmath173 had many remarkable consequences , for example , estimates of the mass of the earth , moon , sun , other planets , and massive black holes .      *",
    "( iv ) * in 1785 coulomb published his investigation of the electric force , using an apparatus involving a torsion balance .",
    "but , according to cavendish , michell had described his torsion balance device to him before 1785 , so it seems that both michell and coulomb must be credited with the invention of the ingenious torsion balance . like the gravitation force , the coulomb force between charged particles is also of the inverse square type .",
    "in fact , here newton s superb theorem  not only applies , but also plays a useful role in providing the empirical evidence as well as the measurement of the constant of proportionality , namely the _ electric force constant _ ( or coulomb s constant ) _ _ @xmath180 ."
