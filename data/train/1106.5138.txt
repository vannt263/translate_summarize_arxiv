    "we are interested in the behavior of a moving interface @xmath0 in a random medium , where @xmath0 is a graph , i.e. defined as @xmath1 and the function @xmath2 evolves according to the following equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a random field representing the random medium and will be defined more precisely later on . note that @xmath5 is not restricted to be either positive or negative .",
    "@xmath6 is a positive constant called `` driving field . ''",
    "the objective is to prove that the solution of - does not get pinned , i.e. does not converge to a nonnegative stationary solution if @xmath6 is above a critical value @xmath7 . to this end , we will show that nonnegative stationary solutions on bounded intervals @xmath8 $ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions get large with high probability as @xmath9    the main contribution of this paper is to show that a _ finite _",
    "@xmath6 is sufficient to keep the graph moving , even if it will have to pass through regions where @xmath10 provided the probability of finding such a region is small . as @xmath5 can become arbitrarily big , one can not find a deterministic subsolution that keeps moving , and instead probabilistic arguments are needed .",
    "the interest in the model stems from the theoretical analysis of the effective behavior on large scales of models for interface evolution specified at a microscopic scale , which is at the heart of many problems in physics and material science .",
    "of particular interest is the influence of material heterogeneities , which are generally assumed to be random .",
    "mathematically , this leads to studying the limit of evolution equations with rapidly varying random coefficients . in the case of dissipative equations , on which we focus here",
    ", the randomness leads to new and interesting effects absent in the case of periodic coefficients , e.g. pinning and de - pinning for obstacles with a strength that can not be bounded uniformly . if the strong obstacles are sufficiently rare , than the interaction through the laplacian helps the graph overcome them although the total forcing @xmath11 remains negative near the obstacle .",
    "one example we have in mind as motivation are driven elastic systems , for a review of the research in physics and its possible applications we refer to @xcite . for a survey of front evolutions in random media , with evolution laws different from the ones considered here ,",
    "see e.g. the recent monograph @xcite .",
    "the model ( [ cdl.eq.interface ] ) is obviously a gradient flow for a random energy .",
    "in fact , it approximates a more geometric interface evolution law :    in fact , if the hypersurface @xmath12 is the boundary of the set @xmath13 then we can define for any bounded @xmath14 the energy @xmath15where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the @xmath18-dimensional hausdorff measure .    requiring that the first variation of that functional ( with respect to inner variations , i.e. deforming the interface with the flow of a smooth vector field ) is proportional to the normal velocity of the interface leads to forced mean curvature flow , @xmath19where @xmath20 denotes the mean curvature of the interface ( trace of the second fundamental form ) and the scalar @xmath21 is the velocity of the interface in the direction of the inner normal .",
    "this geometric evolution law leads to nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations , hence questions concerning the large - scale behaviour of solutions are related to homogenising such equations with periodic or random coefficients .",
    "this is an active field of research ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) but many difficult problems remain open . here",
    "we consider a modified evolution law :    if we suppose that the interface is a graph is `` flat '' ( no overhangs , small gradients ) then we can consider a semi - linear equation as in ( [ cdl.eq.interface ] ) as heuristic approximation of the evolution by forced mean curvature flow .",
    "this model , here called random obstacle model ( rom ) because of the precise nature of the random nonlinearity @xmath22 used in this paper , is a special case of a class of equations sometimes called quenched edwards - wilkinson model which , for some choices of the random nonlinearity , is used in physics as a model for overdamped interface evolution in a random environment when `` overhangs '' can be neglected . for further comments on physical properties and justifications of the model we refer to @xcite . in particular , one expects that solutions move with a deterministic effective ( large - scale ) velocity for @xmath6 larger than a critical forcing @xmath23 for @xmath6 slightly larger than @xmath24 the relation between the effective velocity and @xmath25 is expected to be a power law .",
    "( see also @xcite for the periodic case . ) .",
    "while there are important differences between the forced mean curvature flow and the semi - linear model ( e.g. forced mean curvature flow can `` wrap around '' strong obstacles ) , we expect that the techniques we will develop when studying ( [ cdl.eq.interface ] ) will prove helpful in investigating more general models for interface evolution .",
    "this strategy was successful in the periodic case , where first the semi - linear case was solved ( @xcite ) and then the results could be extended to graphs evolving by forced mean curvature flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "one more reason why such models are of mathematical interest is the relation with `` singular '' homogenization problems , i.e. problems where the @xmath26-equation is of second order ( possibly degenerate ) and the homogenized equation of first order .",
    "note that the effective velocity @xmath27 of an interface evolving with average slope @xmath28 can be found by considering @xmath29 i.e. this can be seen as the `` cell problem '' for @xmath30 with @xmath31    the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the random obstacle model precisely and state our main results .    in section 3",
    ", we introduce an auxiliary model which is more suitable for explicit estimates and whose solutions can be related to solutions of the original equation by the comparison principle for parabolic equation .",
    "this auxiliary problem has the property that any of its stationary solutions @xmath2 solve @xmath32 away from the obstacles and is a convex function on the obstacles .",
    "this fact allows us to define a discretization , using that each solution is determined by its values when entering and leaving an obstacle .",
    "this yields a discretised path @xmath33 characterizing each stationary solution .    in section 4",
    ", we estimate the discrete laplacian of @xmath34 against the obstacles that sit above and below @xmath35 and are approached by the path , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant which can be chosen arbitrarily large .",
    "a technical problem is posed by the fact that the path may pass more than one obstacle above the same integer .    in section 5",
    "we estimate the probability of a discrete path being `` compatible '' with the random environment .",
    "this probability can be estimated against an auxiliary random measure on paths : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a normalization ( corresponding to the partition function in statistical mechanics ) . in section 6",
    "we conclude that the probability of a nonnegative solution of the dirichlet problem to cross @xmath40 is @xmath41 the key observation is that for such a path @xmath42 must be large , which is very unlikely under the auxiliary ( product ) probability measure .    finally , we show by invoking the comparison principle for semi - linear parabolic equations that these results for large @xmath43 imply non - existence of global nonnegative stationary solutions .",
    "this implies that for a solution @xmath2 of ( [ cdl.eq.interface ] ) , ( [ cdl.eq.initial ] ) and all @xmath44 it holds that @xmath45 almost surely in @xmath46 i.e. the interface can not be stopped by the obstacles .",
