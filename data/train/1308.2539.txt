    "a kerr combs is a set of equidistant spectral components generated through the optical pumping of an ultra - high quality factor whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) resonator with kerr nonlinearity . in this system ,",
    "the wgm resonator is pumped by a continuous - wave ( cw ) laser , and the pump photons are transferred through four - wave mixing ( fwm ) to neighboring cavity eigenmodes .",
    "all these excited modes are coupled through fwm , and as a result , may excite an even greater number of modes .",
    "this process can generate as much as several hundred oscillating modes , which will be the spectral components constituting the so - called kerr comb .",
    "kerr comb generators are characterized by their conceptual simplicity , structural robustness , small size , and low power consumption .",
    "they are therefore promising candidates to replace femtosecond mode - locked lasers in applications where these features are of particular relevance .",
    "the theoretical understanding of kerr comb generation in whispering gallery mode resonators is currently the focus of a worldwide activity that is motivated by the wide range of potential applications  @xcite .",
    "another incentive is the necessity to understand the complex light - matter interactions that are induced by the strong confinement of long - lifetime photons in nonlinear media .",
    "early models for kerr comb generation were based on a modal expansion approach  @xcite , which uses a large set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations to track the individual dynamics of the wgms .",
    "this formalism enabled to determine threshold phenomena , to explain the role of dispersion , as well as some of the mechanisms leading to kerr comb generation .",
    "however , this modal model becomes difficult to analyze theoretically when the number of excited modes is higher than five .",
    "indeed , the modal approach simultaneously looses computational cost - effectiveness because the duration of the numerical simulations becomes prohibitively large , as it increases sharply with the number of modes involved in the fwm process  @xcite .",
    "an alternative paradigm has been introduced recently , and it is based on the fact that in the system under study , light circumferentially propagates inside the resonator and can be treated as if it was propagating along an unfolded trajectory with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the system can be modelized by a spatiotemporal formalism known as the lugiato - lefever equation ( lle ) , which is a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with damping , detuning and driving  @xcite .",
    "the variable of the lle is the overall intracavity field , which is the sum of the modal fields described by the modal model .",
    "equivalence between the modal approach and the spatiotemporal formalism have been demonstrated recently , and enables to understand the kerr comb generation process from different viewpoints : the modal approach is useful to investigate threshold phenomena when only few modes are involved , while the spatiotemporal formalism is suitable when a very large number of interacting modes are involved  @xcite . in this latter case ,",
    "mode - locking between the modes can lead to the formation of narrow pulses such as cavity solitons for example . from a more general perspective",

    "note that the normal dispersion pulls the modes leftwards ( redshift ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    amongst the various parameters that are relevant to understand kerr comb generation , group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) is one of the most important .",
    "gvd in wgm resonators can be either normal or anomalous , and the real - valued parameter corresponding to gvd have opposite signs depending on the dispersion regime . from a mathematical point of view , the solutions to be expected using the constitutive dynamical equations are therefore different ; from the physics standpoint , the phenomenology is intrinsically different as well . however , the role of dispersion in kerr comb formation is still a wide open problem , and the various solutions that are expected to arise depending on the sign of dispersion are to a large extent unknown .",
    "this article is the first part of a study where we investigate in detail the bifurcation structure related to the different steady state solutions .",

    "more specifically , we perform a stability analysis of the various solutions that can arise when a nonlinear wgm resonator is pumped in the normal dispersion regime .",

    "[ finalsoliton ] can be viewed as the result of multi - stability , with each stable solution @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 having its own basin of attraction .",
    "the dark solitons that were investigated in the last section are localized dissipative structures : they do not see the boundary conditions and actually , they could be observed as well if the background support was extended to infinity .",

    "the corresponding spectra has single - fsr separation but displays a very complex pattern . indeed ,",

    "these multiple - fsr combs will generally appear whenever we have @xmath171 identical dark solitons separated by a @xmath172 angle .",
    "however , this symmetry is fragile and will be broken by non - identical and/or non - equidistant pulses , yielding non - trivial kerr comb spectra .",
