    "the study of the phase transition in a multi - phase system has been studied for many years . in particular , the multi - step phase transition which involves the formation of intermediate long - lived metastable third phase when the phase transition from one phase to another occurs has been studied for more than a century  @xcite .",
    "recently , a renewed interest in the phase transition in the multi - phase system  @xcite has emerged .",
    "the formation of the thermodynamically metastable third phase is important academically as well as industrially because many industrial products are in a long - lived metastable state  @xcite .    in this report",
    ", we use the cell dynamics method employed previously to study the kinetics of the phase transition in a simple three phase system  @xcite and study the kinetics for more wide spectrum of free energy landscape using phase - field model , which has been extensively used to study various scenarios of phase transition  @xcite .",

    "we pay special attention to the formation of metastable third phase during the phase transition between first to second phases .",
    "in order to study the phase transition kinetics in the multi - phase system , we will use the partial differential equation called isothermal phase - field equation for the non - conserved order parameter  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is called phase - field and is actually the _ non - conserved _ order parameter and @xmath5 is the free energy functional ( grand potential ) , which is usually written as the square - gradient form : @xmath6=\\int \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\psi)^{2}+f(\\psi)\\right]d{\\bf r }   \\label{eq:2 - 2}\\ ] ] where the local part of the free energy @xmath7 will be specified later and will realize the multi - phase system . as a special solution , eq.([eq:2 - 1 ] )",

    "@xcite and celestini and ten bosch  @xcite .",
    "however , the appearance of this dynamically stabilized metastable @xmath1 phase is not due to the special symmetry of planer wave front assumed by those authors  @xcite .",

    "this free energy configuration with metastable intermediate phase or buried metastable phase was previously studied by a few authors  @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath55 front can grow as the @xmath0 phase can grow by consuming the surrounding @xmath1 phase .",
    "however , since we do not include thermal fluctuation ( noise ) in our kinetic equation ( [ eq:2 - 2 ] ) , the @xmath55 front is virtually arrested as there exists a small barrier between @xmath0 well and @xmath1 well ( fig .",

    "figure [ fig:8 ] shows the evolution of the multiple of circular composite nuclei consist of most stable @xmath2 phase of radius 5 surrounded by a thin layer of least stable @xmath0 phase of radius 8 embedded in a least stable @xmath1 phase .",

    "the resulting oval nucleus of @xmath2 wrapped by a thin layer of metastable @xmath0 is static and stable again .",
    "then the metastable @xmath1 phase environment survives even though there are seeds of most stable @xmath2 phase .",
    "this configuration called _ boiled - egg _ structure was predicted from experiments  @xcite and was found by the cell - dynamics simulation of three - phase system by the author  @xcite for the special case of single composite nucleus and the @xmath0-@xmath2 equilibrium .",

    "only a fusion of two colliding nucleus is observed near the center .",
    "this boiled - egg configuration is stable and kinetically arrested . ]",
    "since we start from the static configuration , not only the evolution of the most stable @xmath2 phase by @xmath57 transition is prohibited but also the evolution of the surrounding @xmath0 phase by @xmath58 transition can not be initiated spontaneously as the free energy barrier between @xmath0 phase and @xmath1 phase exists ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "naturally , the introduction of the thermal noise initiates @xmath59 transition  @xcite .",
    "however , this kinetically arrested phase implies fairly long lifetime of these metastable configuration  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have used the cell dynamics method to explore various scenario of phase transition in three - phase system that is characterized by a single non - conserved order parameter .",
    "we have considered three cases when a relative stability of three phases , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 phases are different .",
    "we have found several interesting scenarios of the kinetic of phase transition in a three - phase system : ( a ) the appearance of stable third phase from the interface of two metastable phase , ( b ) the appearance of dynamically stable third metastable phase from the moving interface between stable and metastable phase , and ( c ) the appearance of kinetically arrested third metastable phase around the composite nuclei made from the stable phase surrounded by a thin layer of metastable phase .",
    "although , the last two examples have already been predicted theoretically  @xcite , or numerically  @xcite for special configuration , we showed in this paper using cell - dynamics simulation that these predictions are qualitative correct even for multiple nuclei in two - dimensions and for more wide variety of free energy landscape .",
