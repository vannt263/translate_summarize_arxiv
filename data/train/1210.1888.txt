    "let @xmath3 denote the grassmann manifold of @xmath4-subspaces in an @xmath5-dimensional complex vector space .",
    "the corresponding cluster algebra has finite type ( i.e. , has finitely many seeds ) if and only if @xmath6 .",
    "all of the problems mentioned above are open for any grassmannian of infinite cluster type , so in particular for @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "( the case @xmath9 has been well understood since the early days of cluster algebras , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  12.2 ) . )",
    "we advocate the point of view that many aspects of cluster structures on grassmannians are best understood within a broader range of examples coming from classical invariant theory .",
    "recall that the homogeneous coordinate ring of  @xmath3 ( with respect to a plcker embedding ) is isomorphic to the ring of @xmath0 invariants of @xmath5-tuples of vectors in a @xmath4-dimensional complex vector space  @xmath1 .",
    "more general rings of @xmath0 invariants of collections of vectors and linear forms have been thoroughly studied by classical invariant theory .",
    "we conjecture that _ every such ring carries a natural cluster algebra structure_. in fact , there are typically many such structures , depending on a choice of a cyclic ordering of the tuples of vectors and covectors .    in this paper , we prove this claim in the special case when @xmath1 is @xmath2-dimensional .",
    "our main result ( theorem  [ th : main ] ) describes a family of cluster structures in the rings of @xmath10-invariants of collections of vectors and covectors in  @xmath11 .",
    "the cluster structure ( and moreover the mutation type of the corresponding quiver ) depends on the choice of a _",
    "cyclic signature _ , a binary word describing the order in which vectors and covectors are arranged around a circle .",
    "an accurate formulation of this result requires a description of ( some of ) the seeds defining the cluster structure in question ; this in turn relies on the development of fairly technical combinatorial vocabulary , not to mention the requisite background on cluster algebras , tensor calculus , and basic invariant theory .",
    "this makes it impractical to include the precise statement of our main result in this introduction .",
    "what makes the case @xmath7 special , and amenable to combinatorial approaches that can not be straightforwardly generalized to higher dimensions ? from our perspective , the distinguishing characteristic of the @xmath2-dimensional case is the existence of a beautiful _ web basis _ discovered by greg kuperberg  @xcite .",
    "our investigations were largely motivated by the desire to understand the cluster - theoretic significance of kuperberg s basis .",
    "the main new feature of our approach is an emphasis on the multiplicative properties of the web basis , which along with its compatibility with tensor contraction play a central role in the study of cluster algebra structures in these rings of invariants .    while all of our results hold for arbitrary rings of @xmath10-invariants , with an ( almost ) arbitrary cyclic ordering of vectors and covectors , many of our theorems are new already in the case of grassmannians @xmath12 .",
    "the list of such results includes :    * a large family of new `` non - plcker '' cluster variables ; * compatibility of cluster structures across different values of  @xmath5 ; * examples of `` imaginary '' elements in the web basis ; * examples of negative structure constants ; * a description of clusters associated with arbitrary triangulations of an @xmath5-gon .",
    "the latter description extends a construction given by j.  scott  @xcite , and suggests an extension to other riemann surfaces , which we plan to pursue in a separate  paper .",
    "we describe conjectural ways in which each cluster structure in a classical ring of @xmath10-invariants is intrinsically determined by the corresponding web basis .",
    "we believe that this type of relationship extends to many other settings in which multiplicative properties of some distinguished additive basis in a given commutative ring dictate a `` canonical '' choice of a cluster structure in the ring .",
    "we also believe that , conversely , each cluster algebra of geometric type has an additive basis with certain remarkable properties ; see conjecture  [ conj : a - and - b ] .",
    "perhaps most significantly , we formulate a conjectural combinatorial description ( see conjecture  [ conj : cluster - variables - are - trees ] ) of _ all _ cluster variables in each of our cluster algebras . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first class of cluster algebras of infinite mutation type for which such a description has been proposed .    ",
    "we next outline the general plan of the paper , and review the contents of each section .",
    "sections  [ sec : tensors][sec : webs ] cover the requisite background , some of which may be familiar to the reader . section  [ sec : tensors ] is a reminder on the basic notions of tensor calculus .",
    "section  [ sec : rings - of - invariants ] introduces our main object of study , the ring @xmath13 of @xmath0 invariants of collections of @xmath14  vectors and @xmath15  covectors ( i.e. , linear forms ) in a complex vector space  @xmath1 .",

    "we limit ourselves to the case of cluster algebras defined by quivers , as this is all the generality we need . at the end of the section , we state sufficient conditions that ensure that a particular seed , i.e. , a quiver whose vertices are labeled by elements of a given ring  @xmath16 ,",

    ", we assume that the space  @xmath1 is @xmath2-dimensional . section  [ sec : tensor - diagrams ] is a primer on _ tensor diagrams _ , a particular kind of combinatorial gadgets that can be used to define @xmath0 invariants .",
    "this diagrammatic calculus , popular among physicists , has the advantage of reducing cumbersome calculations with tensors and invariants to repeated applications of certain ( purely combinatorial ) local transformation rules called skein relations .",
    "section  [ sec : webs ] presents the crown jewel of the theory of tensor diagrams : kuperberg s construction of the web basis in @xmath13 .",
    "this basis , which depends on a choice of a cyclic signature , consists of _ web invariants _ , the @xmath0 invariants defined by planar tensor diagrams without short internal cycles .",
    "sections  [ sec : special - invariants ] and  [ sec : special - seeds ] introduce the key combinatorial construction of the paper : a family of `` special seeds '' designed to define a cluster structure in  @xmath13 . in section  [ sec : special - invariants ]",
    ", we describe the `` special invariants '' that appear in those seeds , and state their basic properties .",
    "we then explain in section  [ sec : special - seeds ] how each triangulation of a convex @xmath17-gon gives rise to an extended cluster consisting of @xmath18 special invariants , and to a quiver whose vertices are labeled by them .",
    "an impatient reader unwilling to labor through the rather intricate technicalities of this construction may decide to skip the details , and go directly to section  [ sec : main - theorem ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : main - theorem][sec : zoo ] present the main results and conjectures of the paper .",
    "( the proofs are deferred until later . )",
    "the main theorem ( theorem  [ th : main ] ) asserts that each of the special seeds described in section  [ sec : special - seeds ] defines a cluster algebra structure in the ring of invariants  @xmath13 .",
    "this cluster structure is independent of the choice of such a seed ; in other words , all special seeds are mutation equivalent .",
    "the cluster structure does however depend on the choice of a signature .",
    "in fact , this choice affects the ( cluster ) type of the resulting cluster algebra , and whether it is of finite or infinite type ( resp . , finite or infinite mutation type ) .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : boundary - signatures-5678 ] that lists the cluster types of  @xmath13 for all signatures with @xmath19 .",
    "our main construction has nice functoriality properties : it is preserved by the duality between vectors and covectors , and respected by the natural embeddings of smaller invariant rings into larger ones , induced by the forgetful maps ( dropping a ( co)vector from a collection ) or the maps defined by taking a cross product of two consecutive ( co)vectors . as a corollary , we establish that if a tensor diagram is a planar tree , then the corresponding web invariant is a cluster or coefficient variable .    in section",
    "[ sec : main - conjectures ] , we discuss many conjectural connections between our main construction and kuperberg s web basis .",
    "in particular , we expect this basis to contain all cluster monomials .",
    "furthermore , we expect two cluster variables to be compatible if and only if their product is a web invariant .",
    "we formulate criteria that should distinguish cluster variables / monomials among more general web invariants .",
    "while the web basis has many wonderful properties , it _ may _ have negative structure constants ( cf .",
    "conjecture  [ conj : strong - positivity ] and proposition  [ prop : negative - structure - const ] ) .",
    "this is perhaps not so surprising in light of the discovery , made by m.  khovanov and g.  kuperberg  @xcite , that the web basis is generally different from the _ dual canonical basis _ ,",
    "i.e. , the basis dual to g.  lusztig s canonical basis  @xcite . putting things into a cluster - theoretic context",
    "allows us to `` explain '' the khovanov - kuperberg smallest counterexample : it corresponds to the square of the simplest web invariant which is not a cluster variable .",
    "as established by b.  leclerc @xcite and p.  lampe  @xcite , for the cluster type at hand the appropriate element of the dual canonical basis is given by the quadratic chebyshev polynomial of the second kind .",
    "using the chebyshev polynomial of the first kind recovers the corresponding element of the `` atomic '' basis of p.  sherman and a.  zelevinsky  @xcite , while the square lies in the _ dual semicanonical basis _ , see  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask : does the web basis always coincide with the appropriate dual semicanonical ( or `` generic '' ) basis , in the sense of @xcite ?",
    "section  [ sec : arborization ] begins by our favorite conjecture of the paper ( conjecture  [ conj : cluster - variables - are - trees ] ) that describes , in simple combinatorial terms , the entire set of cluster monomials in  @xmath13 . according to this conjecture ,",
    "a cluster monomial is an @xmath0 invariant that possesses two alternative presentations by a single tensor diagram : first , by a ( planar , non - elliptic ) web ; second , by a ( possibly non - planar ) forest .",
    "if , in addition , this invariant does not factor ( so that this forest is actually a tree ) , then the invariant is a cluster or coefficient variable .",
    "we then present an explicit _ arborization _ algorithm that conjecturally detects whether a given web defines a cluster monomial ( resp .",
    ", a cluster or coefficient variable ) by applying a sequence of skein relations that either transform the web into a forest ( resp . , tree ) , or else determine that this is impossible .",
    "section  [ sec : zoo ] presents a gallery of fairly complicated examples of webs illustrating various phenomena that we discovered .",
    "these include : non - arborizable webs , both `` real '' and `` imaginary '' ( in the sense of b.  leclerc  @xcite ) ; `` fake '' exchange relations involving web invariants ; and the aforementioned negative structure constants .    sections  [ sec : special - proofs][sec : other - proofs ] contain the proofs of the results stated in sections  [ sec : special - invariants][sec : main - theorem ] and  [ sec : arborization ] .",
    "specifically , the properties of special invariants and special seeds formulated in sections  [ sec : special - invariants][sec : special - seeds ] are proved in sections  [ sec : special - proofs][sec : properties - of - special - seeds ] .",
    "the construction of the quiver associated with a special seed defined by an arbitrary triangulation is outlined in section  [ sec : building - a - quiver ] .",

    "the last two sections play the role of appendices .",
    "section  [ sec : t - fan ] describes , in precise combinatorial terms , the construction of a special seed associated with a particular choice of a triangulation .",
    "this is in principle sufficient to identify a cluster structure in the ring  @xmath13 once the main theorem has been proved .",

    "it is straightforward to verify that the construction described in  @xcite arises as a special case of our setup for the `` zig - zag '' triangulation that includes all diagonals of the form @xmath555 and @xmath556 .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we include a case - by - case verification that in the case of monochromatic signature , the seeds @xmath557 related by a single flip are indeed obtained from each other by mutations .",
    "we stated this claim in section  [ sec : proof - main ] for an arbitrary signature , but did not conduct an exhaustive examination of all possible non - generic cases .",
    "such an examination ( for @xmath396 ) is presented in figures  [ fig : webs49b][fig : webs48b ] .",
    "our goal is to identify the cluster structure after dropping a boundary vertex with a part of the original cluster structure .",
    "there are several cases to consider .",
    "figure  [ fig : webs20 ] explains how to handle the case where the color of the dropped vertex differs from both of its neighbors . other cases are treated in a similar way .",
    "we follow the pattern of the proof of theorem  [ th : drop - vertex ] , examining one characteristic example ( see figure  [ fig : webs19 ] ) instead of conducting a formal case by case analysis .",
    "the size of this example is large enough to demonstrate what happens in general .",
    "any planar tree can be grown by repeated application of the operations of adding a fork and dropping a vertex .",
    "make sure to never pass through an alternating signature ; this can indeed be done .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "the construction of an extended cluster @xmath332 can be carried out verbatim with the black and white colors swapped .",
    "let us denote the resulting set by  @xmath558 .",
    "note that the definition of a proxy vertex remains the same .",
    "the only difference between the two constructions is that for each triangle @xmath331 in  @xmath22 , we use ( the factors of ) the special invariant @xmath266 to build  @xmath332 whereas the construction of @xmath558 involves  @xmath267 . in each instance where the latter choice yields an indecomposable factor that does not come from any special invariant contributing to  @xmath332",
    ", one can use the relation to mutate between the two seeds .",
    "this can be verified on a case by case basis , treating each fundamental region separately .",
    "a skein relation yields the identity shown in figure  [ fig : webs27b ] .",
    "it remains to note that the second term vanishes as it is both symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to the ( co)vectors corresponding to the two sibling vertices .",
    "the proof is a straightforward application of the diamond lemma .",
    "the five possible nontrivial diamonds are shown in figure  [ fig : webs28 ] .",
    "the idea of the proof is as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath271 arborizes to a tree diagram  @xmath180 .",
    "let us reverse the arborization process : starting with  @xmath180 , we step by step `` planarize '' it ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : basic - step ] ) , each time creating a four - edge fragment of one of the two kinds described in definition  [ def : arborizing - step ] .",
    "now make a tensor diagram for  @xmath456 by bundling together @xmath4 copies of  @xmath180 , and apply a planarization procedure following the same steps , each time planarizing all @xmath4 copies . at the end of this process",
    ", we are going to obtain the @xmath4-thickening of  @xmath271 , thereby proving the theorem .",
    "we illustrate how this works using the example in figure  [ fig : webs31 ] .",
    "the left picture shows an intermediate stage of the planarization process , with @xmath7 .",
    "the six white vertices correspond to two sibling vertices in  @xmath180 .",
    "remember that we are transforming our tensor diagram from the inside out , i.e. , moving towards the boundary .",
    "the portions attached underneath those six vertices all look identical : they are patterned after the same subtree of  @xmath180 .",
    "we proceed in two stages as shown in the figure . at the first stage ,",
    "we planarize around the two triples of black vertices , using skein relations ( including the square move ) .",
    "each time , all terms but one vanish because they can be seen to be both symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to a pair of arguments . at the second stage , we planarize the intersection of @xmath4-thickenings of two edges of  @xmath180 using a similar calculation .",
    "let us also point out why it is crucial for this argument that the diagram @xmath180 is a tree .",
    "we need to start the process of reverse arborization from some internal vertex . in a tree",
    ", one can choose either of the three directions and have all @xmath4 copies of this vertex have the same origin in this direction .",
    "this allows to planarize the part of the @xmath4 copies of the original web around this vertex ( as it was just described ) .",
    "if @xmath180 is not a tree however , copies of the vertices belonging to cycles do not share a common origin , and thus the argument fails .",
    "the cluster structure in the ring of invariants  @xmath111 is in principle determined by a single initial seed @xmath377 .",
    "consequently , one may be interested in identifying a particular choice of a triangulation  @xmath22 for which the seed @xmath377 has a simpler and more explicit description than the general case as presented in sections  [ sec : special - invariants][sec : special - seeds ] .",
    "one  such choice is discussed in this section .",
    "denote @xmath559 .",
    "since the signature @xmath112 is non - alternating , we can assume without loss of generality that the vertices @xmath203 and  @xmath173 are black .",
    "( if we can only find two adjacent white vertices , then use the same recipe with the colors swapped , cf .",
    "theorem  [ th : swap - colors ] . )",
    "the case @xmath396 has been covered in figure  [ fig : webs47 ] .",
    "so let @xmath112 be non - monochromatic .",
    "without loss of generality , we can assume that the vertex  @xmath5 is white .",
    "let @xmath560 be the triangulation of the @xmath5-gon  @xmath376 obtained by drawing all diagonals with an endpoint at the vertex  @xmath203 .",
    "the quiver @xmath561 is constructed as follows .    1 .",
    "place two ( mutable ) vertices of @xmath561 on each diagonal of  @xmath560 .",
    "place one frozen vertex on each side of  @xmath376 .",
    "2 .   fill each triangle in @xmath560 with arrows as shown in figure  [ fig : webs44 ] .",
    "the choice of a pattern is determined by the color of the right endpoint of the base side .",
    "3 .   assemble a quiver from these pieces , removing @xmath173-cycles if necessary .",
    "4 .   on the diagonal @xmath562 , freeze the vertex closer to  @xmath203 , and identify it with the frozen vertex  @xmath563 .",
    "5 .   on the diagonal @xmath564 ,",
    "freeze one vertex , namely the one closer to  @xmath203 ( resp .",
    ",  @xmath565 ) if @xmath565 is white ( resp . ,",
    "identify it with @xmath566 if @xmath567 is white , and with @xmath568 if it is black .",
    "add arrows connecting the mutable vertices on diagonals @xmath562 and",
    "@xmath564 to the frozen vertices @xmath563 , @xmath569 , @xmath566 , and  @xmath568 as shown in figure  [ fig : webs44 ] on the  right . remove 2-cycles if necessary ; this will happen if vertex @xmath2 is black .",
    "[ enum : except - q ] if @xmath567 is black , replace the portions of the resulting quiver inside the pentagon @xmath570 as shown in figure  [ fig : webs45 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : webs46 ] shows an example of applying this construction .",
    "when the vertex @xmath567 is white , the above construction of the quiver @xmath561 simplifies substantially as we do not have to make the adjustments described in step  .",
    "if one is only interested in the cluster type of  @xmath111 , the description simplifies further :    let @xmath571 $ ] , @xmath572 , be a signature such that @xmath573 and @xmath574 .",
    "let @xmath560 be the triangulation of @xmath376 by the diagonals incident to the vertex  @xmath203 .",
    "then the mutable part of the quiver @xmath561 is obtained by taking the vertices @xmath575 and @xmath576 together with the following edges :    * for @xmath577 , draw an edge @xmath578 ; * for @xmath579 , draw an edge @xmath580 ; * for @xmath581 , if @xmath582 , then draw an edge @xmath583 ; * for @xmath581 , if @xmath584 , then draw an edge @xmath585 ; * for @xmath586 , if @xmath582 , then draw an edge @xmath587 ; * for @xmath586 , if @xmath584 , then draw an edge @xmath588 .",
