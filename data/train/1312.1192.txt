    "the coulomb corrections to the total cross section of muon pair photoproduction were discussed in a set of publications @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the born cross section , where the main contribution is given by the impact parameter @xmath14 in the region @xmath15 , the main contribution to the coulomb corrections stems from region @xmath16 .",
