    "the past five years have seen remarkable breakthroughs in our ability to identify and systematically study ordinary galaxies at very large redshifts , not just as isolated case studies , but _ en masse _ as a galaxy _ population .",
    "_ to date , nearly 1000 galaxies have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath0 , mostly identified via broad  band color selection techniques ( steidel 1996 , i.e. , the lyman break galaxies , or lbgs ) , but with other important and complementary methods also coming into play ( sub  mm and radio surveys , emission line searches , qso absorption systems , etc . ) .",
    "a broad census of galaxy properties at @xmath9 now seems within reach , covering star formation rates ( sfrs ) , dust content , morphologies , spatial clustering , and perhaps even chemical abundances and internal kinematics .",
    "although i have retained my assigned title , ` the first galaxies ... , ' it is far from clear that we know when , where , or how to find the ` first ' galaxies .",
    "the @xmath9 lbgs may or may not be the first major wave of galaxy formation . if anything , current data favors a roughly constant global sfr ( as traced by cosmic uv luminosity density , at least ) from @xmath12 , with no certain evidence for a decline at higher redshifts ( steidel 1999 ) . the sub  mm population detected by scuba ( cf .",
    "cowie , this volume ) may or may not represent the bulk of early star formation , and the upper redshift bound to scuba sources remains unknown .",
    "the reionization of the intergalactic medium at @xmath13 and the presence of metals in the ly  @xmath14 forest at @xmath9 point toward earlier epochs of star and galaxy formation , at least in trace amounts .",
    "a handful of galaxies now have plausible spectroscopic confirmation at @xmath13 , but too few for any systematic census .",
    "for this reason , i can not promise to live up to my title : i do not know what the first galaxies are or what they look like . given this ignorance ,",
    "i will focus the first part of this article on the structure and stellar populations of the most distant _ well studied _ galaxies , the @xmath9 lyman break objects .",
    "this is not meant as a comprehensive review , but will instead concentrate on new imaging and photometric data from nicmos on _ hst _ that extend our knowledge of lbg properties to the optical rest frame . in his contribution to this volume , max",
    "pettini provides a complementary discussion of recent efforts to measure chemical abundances and internal kinematics for these same galaxies . in the second part of my article",
    ", i will describe efforts to extend lyman break color selection to still larger redshifts , approaching ( or perhaps even exceeding ) @xmath15 . in this way",
    "i hope to at least provide a look into the epoch when ` the first galaxies ' might plausibly have been formed , and to catalog what we can find right now , in the pre_ngst _ era , given the best available survey data .      for the past five years",
    ", the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) have provided the most exquisitely deep , high angular resolution optical census of the distant universe .",
    "it is important ( if somewhat pedantic ) to consider what an hdf is actually good for .",
    "one wfpc2 field covers 5 arcmin@xmath16 , and probes a very small co  moving volume at @xmath17 , enough to hold only @xmath1830 @xmath1 galaxies , depending on the cosmology .",
    "given small number statistics and concerns about clustering , the central hdf is therefore not the best place study massive galaxies in the ` low ' redshift universe , despite the fact that most of cosmic time and most bright galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are at @xmath19 .",
    "there is far more volume at high redshift : 10.5 to 40@xmath20 more at @xmath21 than at @xmath17 for plausible cosmologies , room enough for several hundred @xmath1 galaxies or their progenitors .    at @xmath22 , the optical light emitted from galaxies shifts into the near  infrared .",
    "thus in order to compare @xmath0 galaxies to their local counterparts , and to search for still more distant objects at @xmath4 , it is important to extend the wavelength baseline .",
    "north was observed in the near  ir from the ground in several different programs ( e.g. , hogg 1997 ; barger 1998 ; and our own kpno 4 m @xmath23 imaging , cf .",
    "dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "the depth and angular resolution ( typically @xmath24 ) of these data are a poor match to that of the optical wfpc2 hdf images .",
    "two programs therefore targeted the hdf  north with nicmos on board _ hst _ , providing much deeper images with high angular resolution .",
    "the nicmos gtos ( thompson 1999 ) imaged one nicmos camera 3 field ( @xmath25 ) for 49 orbits each at f110w ( 1.1@xmath26 m ) and f160w ( 1.6@xmath26 m ) .",
    "our own program mosaiced the complete hdf with a mean exposure time of 12600s per filter in f110w and f160w .",
    "sensitivity varies over the field of view , but the average depth is ab  @xmath27 at @xmath28 in an @xmath29 diameter aperture .",
    "the drizzled psf has fwhm  =  @xmath30 , primarily limited by the nic3 pixel scale . because most galaxies have spectral energy distributions ( seds ) which brighten ( in @xmath31 units ) at redder wavelengths , our images detect roughly half of the galaxies from the wfpc2 hdf , despite their short exposure times .",
    "we have also reanalyzed our kpno @xmath32 images to optimally extract photometry matched to the wfpc2+nicmos data .",
    "these data are not as deep as one would like , which is unfortunate because they provide the only access to rest frame optical wavelengths for objects at @xmath33 , but they are the best presently available .    thanks to the dedicated efforts of the observers , a remarkably high density of spectroscopic redshifts is available in the hdf ",
    "n : @xmath34 galaxies ( plus a few stars ) in the central wfpc2+nicmos field alone , with 33 objects at @xmath35 .",
    "taking advantage of the high quality photometric data , many investigators have used multicolor selection ( e.g.  the two color lyman break criteria of steidel 1996 , madau 1996 , and others ) or photometric redshifts ( e.g. , fernndez ",
    "soto 1999 ) to identify high redshift galaxy candidates .",
    "there are advantages and drawbacks to both approaches , but both have demonstrated remarkable successes . in this discussion , i will make use of both methods . for the photometric redshifts ,",
    "i will use fits to our 7band hdf photometry by budavri ( 2000 ) , whose ` adaptive template ' method is a modification of an otherwise straightforward spectral template fitting scheme .",
    "i will use ab magnitudes here throughout , and notate the six wfpc2 + nicmos bandpasses by 300 , 450 , 606 , 814 , 110 and 160 . unless stated otherwise",

    "the nicmos @xmath39 images sample rest frame wavelengths in the optical @xmath40 to @xmath41 bands from @xmath42 to 2.8 .",
    "this upper bound is about the midpoint of the redshift range where 300dropout lyman break selection in the hdf is most efficient .",
    "therefore , at these redshifts we may use the nicmos data to study the morphologies of lbgs at wavelengths where long  lived stars , if they are present , may dominate the light from the galaxy , and where dust obscuration should play a significantly lesser role than it does in the ultraviolet . for lbgs at @xmath43 , the nicmos @xmath39 bandpass slips into the rest frame ultraviolet , and the nicmos images once again",
    "tell us more about the distribution of star formation within galaxies than about that of their stellar mass .",
    "figure  1 compares rest frame uv and optical images of a set of hdf lbgs with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "the nicmos data have somewhat poorer angular resolution ( 022  compared to 014  for wfpc2 ) , but otherwise the most striking thing is the broad similarity of the uv and optical morphologies .",
    "giavalisco ( 1996 ) and lowenthal ( 1997 ) have emphasized the very small sizes of lbgs in wfpc2 images , and the same is true at nicmos wavelengths .",
    "accounting for psf differences , the half ",
    "light radii of the galaxies measured from the nicmos images are the same as ( or in some cases , slightly smaller than ) those from the wfpc2 data .",
    "notable morphological differences are seen in only a few cases , e.g. , 2585.1 ( @xmath44 ) and 452 ( @xmath45 ) , two of the largest lbgs in the hdf .",
    "each has a region of diffuse emission in the wfpc2 images which lights up in the nicmos @xmath39 data , with quite red colors .",
    "it is not clear whether this is due to the presence of dust , older and redder starlight , or possibly strong line emission .",
    "galaxies detected at 8.5  ghz by richards 1998 .",
    "the radio centroid is coincident with the diffuse , red , ir  bright region in the galaxy . ]    in general there is no evidence that the uv  bright regions seen by wfpc2 are just star  forming ` fragments ' embedded within some larger , mature host galaxy . on the whole , one or more of",
    "the following appears to be true : ( 1 ) the stars which dominate the light at @xmath212001800  also dominate at @xmath240005500 ; ( 2 ) if components with substantially different ages and colors are present , then they are fairly well mixed , spatially ; ( 3 ) dust extinction does not play a dominant role in shaping the morphologies of lbgs at these wavelengths .",
    "all of this should be taken _",
    "_ the important caveat that at fwhm  @xmath46 resolution , most of the lbgs are _ not _ exquisitely resolved : they are typically very small , having only a few resolution elements within their isophotally detectable areas , and thus many details are surely lost except perhaps for the few , largest objects .    it is striking that among the nicmos images of @xmath47 hdf lbgs ( those with and without spectroscopic redshifts ) , virtually _ none _ resembles a ` classical ' hubble sequence spiral galaxy .",
    "giant disk galaxies are found in the hdf and elsewhere out to at least @xmath48 ( see , e.g. , examples from nicmos in bunker 1999 and dickinson 2000 ) , and various studies have found that their structural properties and comoving abundances have not changed dramatically since @xmath49 ( lilly 1998 ; simard 1999 ) . at @xmath0",
    ", however , there appear to be no objects with immediately recognizable spiral structure , no bulges surrounded by symmetric , diffuse disks , nor even good candidates for thin , edge  on disks ( some lbgs are fairly elongated , but none really could be mistaken for an edge  on spiral ) . among the objects shown in figure  1 , perhaps 2585.1 ( @xmath50 ) appears closest to showing spiral structure at rest frame optical wavelengths , but this requires some imagination .",
    "given the evidence from nicmos , the absence of classical spiral morphologies can not be attributed solely to rest frame wavelength effects .",
    "we have carried out simulations using optical rest frame images of virgo cluster spirals and of hdf disk galaxies at @xmath17 , artificially inserted into the nicmos images at high redshift with the appropriate surface brightness dimming and psf convolution .",
    "although low surface brightnesses and limited angular resolution wipe out many of the details of spiral structure , giant ( @xmath51 ) disk galaxies should be detectable and recognizable at @xmath0 even with _ no _ luminosity or surface brightness evolution .",
    "this is not to say that lbgs can not be disk galaxies : as already noted , the small angular sizes of most lbgs preclude detailed resolution , and some of these objects could well be small disks .",
    "indeed , giavalisco ( 1996 ) noted exponential surface brightness profiles among some lbgs .",
    "giavalisco also found that some lbgs have @xmath52 law profiles , although it is not clear whether to interpret this as indicating a relation between lbgs and present  day ellipticals and bulges .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that there are few candidates for intrinsically _ red _ elliptical galaxies at @xmath0 in the hdf , i.e. , objects which would be recognized as elliptical galaxies today both by morphology and by the characteristic color signature of an older stellar population .",
    "in fact , considering objects with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts in the range @xmath53 , where the nicmos+kpno infrared data still reach the optical rest frame , there are only a handful of galaxies with rest frame colors redder than that of a present  day scd spiral ( i.e. , an actively star forming galaxy ) , even in an infrared  selected sample which should have no bias against such objects .",
    "i return to this point in  4 below .",
    "nearly every hdf galaxy at @xmath0 which is detectable at @xmath54 m appears to be forming stars , and most quite vigorously .",
    "we _ do _ find apparently red , dead ellipticals in the hdf out to ( photometric ) redshifts @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "dickinson 2000 ; stanford in prep . ) , but only one ( marginally ) viable candidate for a red elliptical at higher redshift .",
    "this is the so  called ` @xmath56dropout ' object hdfn  jd1 ( see  6 ) , whose colors might be matched by those of a maximally old elliptical galaxy at @xmath57 ( dickinson 2000 ) .",
    "overall , it seems that the maturation of the giant spiral and elliptical galaxies took place at @xmath58 .",
    "even with extremely deep , high angular resolution infrared images like the hdf / nicmos data , we find few ( if any ) mature spirals or ellipticals ( or candidates for such ) at higher redshift .",
    "by @xmath59 , many ( if not necessarily all ) large spirals and red giant ellipticals were already in place , pointing to the redshift range @xmath5 as an important ` golden age ' for the formation of the hubble sequence .",
    "figure  2 shows a photometric compendium of spectroscopically confirmed hdf galaxies at @xmath60 , all shifted to the rest frame and normalized to a common flux density at @xmath612000 .",
    "the shaded envelope is defined by local uv  to  optical starburst galaxy spectral templates from kinney ( 1996 ) , which span a broad range in optical / uv extinction .",
    "the hdf lbgs fall comfortably within the range of sed shapes defined by the local starbursts .",
    "they have relatively blue ( but usually not flat spectrum ) uv continua , with a flux increase and spectral inflection around the balmer/4000   break region that indicates the presence of older ( a and later ) stars which apparently contribute a significant fraction of the rest frame optical light .",
    "the fact that the uv continuum slope for lbgs is nearly always redder than flat spectrum has generally been interpreted as an indication of dust extinction ( e.g. , meurer 1997 , 1999 ; dickinson 1998 ; pettini 1998 ) , although for some objects it might also result from an aging stellar population with declining or inactive star formation . considered individually ,",
    "the large majority of hdf lbgs are reasonably well fit by the kinney starbursts with modest reddening ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "few approach the more heavily reddened templates",
    ". this may be true by definition / selection , of course , since we are considering the brighter objects for which redshifts were successfully measured , and which were selected for spectroscopy by their uv colors ( but see  4 below ) .    with photometry spanning the uv  to ",
    "optical rest frame it becomes interesting to compare the lbg photometry to population synthesis models to look for constraints on galaxy ages , reddening , and star formation histories .",
    "very roughly , if the uv spectral slope provides a measure of extinction ( modulo an assumed reddening law ) , then the uv  optical flux ratio , and particularly the amplitude of any inflection around the balmer/4000  break region , may help constrain the past star formation history , particularly the ratio of older stars to ongoing star formation .",
    "this was first done by sawicki & yee ( 1998 ) using ground  based @xmath23 photometry for lbgs in the hdf .",
    "their results favored young ages ( median value @xmath63  myr ) and fairly heavy reddening ( typical @xmath64 , or 3  mag extinction at 1600  assuming calzetti 1997 starburst dust attenuation ) . we have carried out a similar exercise using the nicmos data and @xmath65band fluxes rederived from the kpno data using a technique ( much like that of fernndez ",
    "soto 1999 ) which properly matches photometry from images with very different angular resolutions .",
    "a complete presentation will be given in papovich ( in prep . ) and is beyond the scope of the present discussion , but i summarize some important points here .",
    "even with precise nicmos photometry , constraints on ages and reddening are quite loose .",
    "this is in part because of the usual degeneracies in fitting models to broad band colors ( age vs.  metallicity vs.  extinction ) , but also because the available photometry simply does not reach long enough rest frame wavelengths . at @xmath66 , only the lower@xmath67 ground ",
    "based @xmath32 data extend redward of the balmer/4000  break region ; for this reason , here i consider only galaxies at @xmath3 . for each galaxy",
    ", we may define confidence intervals in the multidimensional space of the various fitting parameters such as age , sfr e  folding timescale , reddening , metallicity , and imf .",
    "the color degeneracies allow fairly broad ranges in acceptable parameters for each object , and the variety among the galaxy seds ( figure  2 ) scatters the best  fitting parameters throughout a range of values .",
    "nevertheless , taken as an ensemble , certain regions of model parameter space are preferred .",
    "figure  3 shows a composite distribution for 16 galaxies with @xmath68 , where model fits for each object have been averaged , weighted by their likelihoods in the multi  parameter space .",
    "the contours thus indicate a distribution of likely parameter values for the ensemble of uv  selected lbgs .",
    "the best  fitting values of @xmath69 vs.  age for individual objects are marked by dots .",
    "some galaxies can be fit reasonably well by parameter values falling toward the outer contours of the ensemble distribution , but the majority occupy the higher confidence regions .",
    "the most favored age range spans 0.031  gyr , with extinction @xmath70 .",
    "the extinction values agree well with the comparison to the kinney starburst templates ( figure  2 ) , which is not unexpected given that the calzetti attenuation law is derived in part from the same uv spectral data on local starburst galaxies .",
    "the range of likely age and extinction values becomes slightly smaller and can shift somewhat if restrictions on metallicity or imf are adopted , although in general the broad band photometry offers little constraint on these parameters .",
    "younger ages and larger extinction are allowed and even favored for some objects , but in general the most likely values are somewhat older and less reddened than those found by sawicki & yee .",
    "this may be due to more precise photometry from nicmos , or to better control of the relative optical ",
    "ir colors ( particularly in the @xmath65band ) from our photometric method .",
    "it is not clear whether the apparent anticorrelation between age and extinction in figure  3 is significant .",
    "we expect degeneracy between the age and extinction values fit to individual objects , but the overall trend seen in the population may be greater than would be expected from the fitting uncertainties alone .",
    "the ` most favored ' extinction value , @xmath71 , corresponds to @xmath72  mag , or a factor of @xmath73 .",
    "the _ net _ uv extinction for the sample ( and hence the correction to any derived global star formation rate ) would be larger , however , driven by the objects with the greatest reddening .",
    "a characteristic timescale for lyman break galaxies can be defined from their sizes ( median half  light radii @xmath74  kpc for the hdf lbgs ) and typical velocity dispersions ( @xmath75  km  s@xmath76 ; see pettini , this volume ) .",
    "this yields @xmath77  myr .",
    "if the uv light is due to ongoing star formation , we would not expect sfr lifetimes @xmath78 , and indeed this is roughly the lower bound of the best ",
    "fit model age range , with the most favored value being @xmath79  myr , or @xmath80 .",
    "this range is not dissimilar to that estimated for star formation in galactic ",
    "scale starburst events ( e.g. , ulirgs ) locally .",
    "using an infrared  selected catalog , we may ask what galaxies might be missed altogether by lyman break color selection keyed to the rest frame uv light .",
    "in particular , one might expect some red high redshift galaxies , either because they are not actively forming stars or because of extinction , that would ` drop out ' of the dropout samples . here",
    "i restrict my analysis to @xmath81 , where we believe our catalogs are highly complete , uncontaminated by spurious sources , and where the nicmos photometry has @xmath82 . at @xmath83",
    ", @xmath81 corresponds to rest frame @xmath84 for the adopted cosmology , or @xmath85  mag fainter than present ",
    "day @xmath86 .",
    "the typical lbg at @xmath87 has @xmath88 , the practical limit for hdf 300dropout selection using standard 2color criteria , but red galaxies with similar rest frame optical luminosities might be fainter or absent in the uv .    at @xmath81",
    "there is only one object which is undetected with @xmath89 in 606 or 814 ( both , in this case ) : this is the ` @xmath56dropout ' hdfn  jd1 ( see also   2 and 6 ) .",
    "in fact , this is the only nicmos  selected object with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "two other objects have @xmath92 ; both are @xmath93 606dropout candidates identified by lanzetta ( 1996 ) and fernndez  soto ( 1999 ) , one of which ( 3951 ) was spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath94 ( spinrad 1999 ) . thus the only possible candidate for a nicmos  selected , ` uv  invisible ' galaxy at @xmath9 is hdfn  jd1 .",
    "next let us consider uv ",
    "bright objects which might nevertheless have been missed by the lbg color criteria , using the 7band photometric redshift estimates for all galaxies . in principle",
    ", these may identify plausible candidates at @xmath60 that otherwise fall outside a given set of uv color criteria , as long as their intrinsic seds are ` recognizably similar ' to those of galaxies at lower redshift which define the templates used for the phot@xmath95 fitting .",
    "figure  4 shows the @xmath96 distributions for all hdf galaxies with @xmath97 , and for those that meet the 300 dropout criteria @xmath98 and @xmath99 from dickinson ( 1998 ) .",
    "there are 43 objects with @xmath100 which do _ not _ meet the lbg color criteria .",
    "however , nearly all are at @xmath101 or @xmath102 , and lie just outside the color selection boundaries defined here : either slightly too blue at low @xmath95 , or slightly too red at high @xmath95 .",
    "this is expected : the selection efficiency of the 2color method is not uniform with redshift , and falls off at the extremes of the range for which it is optimized ( cf .",
    "steidel 1999 ) .",
    "only 7 ` missed ' objects fall at intermediate photometric redshifts , @xmath103 , and most of these are also just outside the color selection box .",
    "some are quite interesting , including a @xmath26jy radio source with very red @xmath104 colors which may be a dusty starburst or a fading post ",
    "starburst galaxy at @xmath105 .",
    "others may be scattered out of the box by photometry errors ( especially in 300 ) , or might not be at the indicated @xmath96 . but all are well detected in the optical hdf .",
    "overall , there is no evidence for a _ substantial _ population ( by number ) of galaxies at @xmath60 that are missed by uv lyman break color selection but which are detectable in the near  infrared .",
    "if there are energetically important but highly obscured galaxies at these redshifts like those detected by scuba , then they are either _ also _ detectable with optical imaging data , or they are so heavily enshrouded that even nicmos can not easily see them .",
    "for the five sub  mm sources detected in the hdf by hughes ( 1998 ) , our nicmos images do not reveal any new counterparts previously undetected by wfpc2 , nor do any of the candidate identifications have particularly unusual optical  ir colors .",
    "the successes of color selection techniques at @xmath106 make it tempting to extend the methods to higher redshifts , i.e. , to search for @xmath40 or @xmath107dropouts . doing so properly requires deep near  infrared data to provide at least one color longward of the redshifted 912  and 1216  breaks .",
    "indeed , galaxies at @xmath108 should have virtually no detectable optical flux . lanzetta ( 1996 ) and fernndez  soto ( 1999 ) identified candidate @xmath93 hdf galaxies from @xmath109 colors supplemented by infrared limits from the kpno data ; two of these have subsequently been confirmed via spectroscopy ( weymann 1999 ; spinrad 1999 ) .",
    "with nicmos we can extend this to fainter limits and larger redshifts : an @xmath1 lyman break galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath1 in the rest frame uv at @xmath110 ) should be detectable in the nicmos images with @xmath111 out to @xmath112 for spatially flat cosmologies with @xmath113 , and out to @xmath114 for an @xmath115 open universe ( see figure  5 ) .    here",
    "we test the null hypothesis that the galaxy population at @xmath116 is similar to that of the 300dropout lbgs at @xmath9 , whose _ observed _ characteristics are by now reasonably well known even if their intrinsic properties , such as dust content , star formation rate , mass , etc .",
    "are the subject of continued debate .",
    "in particular , we adopt the rest frame uv luminosity function and uv spectral slope ( i.e. , intrinsic color ) distribution for lbgs at @xmath117 derived in steidel ( 1999 ) , and use this to predict what should be seen in color  color diagrams _ if  _ the same population were present at higher redshifts .",
    "we do this via monte carlo simulations , including realistic errors for the hdf wfpc2+nicmos photometry , comparing the number of high@xmath95 objects that are predicted to fall in some specified color  color box to the actual number of similar objects found in the hdf catalogs .",
    "figure  6 shows a series of 2color diagrams for the hdf , each using combinations of three adjacent bandpasses , from @xmath118 ( i.e. , @xmath9 selection ) through @xmath119 ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) . in each case , i define somewhat arbitrary selection boxes based on the expected location of high redshift galaxies in color  color space ( and also to avoid low redshift contaminants ) , then count the galaxies in those boxes and compare this to the ` no evolution ' ( ne ) model predictions ( figure 7 ) .",

    "steidel ( 1999 ) , who surveyed larger solid angles in several fields , suggest that the bright end of the @xmath123 lf is actually compatible with that at @xmath9 .",
    "the hdf may just be an anomaly , indicating the importance of field  to  field fluctuations , or perhaps the faint end slope of the lf ( to which the hdf number counts are quite sensitive ) evolves with redshift .",
    "for the @xmath124dropouts , there are @xmath125 candidates with @xmath126 ( including the two with spectroscopic confirmation ) , compared to a prediction of @xmath127 .",
    "careful inspection of their images and seds suggests that they are all very plausible @xmath128 candidates .",
    "there are _ no _ @xmath129dropout candidates with @xmath90 , and only two with @xmath130 , one of which is clearly detected at @xmath122 and @xmath124 and thus is probably not at @xmath131 .",
    "the models predict 9 to 13 objects to this magnitude limit . some of the fainter objects may be real @xmath131 galaxies , but",
    "on visual inspection many are rather dubious , with very low @xmath67 ; only a few are persuasive to a skeptical eye . at @xmath132",

    "there is only partial overlap between the @xmath137dropout and photometric redshift samples , but this is understandable since most of the candidates are very faint with low@xmath67 photometry and poor photometric redshift constraints ( i.e. , relatively flat @xmath96 likelihood functions ) .",
    "the space density of the bright lbg candidates appears to thin at @xmath138 , and at @xmath139 there are no candidates with uv luminosities greater than the characteristic @xmath1 at @xmath110 , despite abundant volume to house them if they were present with similar space densities .",

    "this can affect the likelihood of detecting high redshift galaxies , as well as the fluxes measured with isophotally  based photometry schemes .",
    "lanzetta show that the global rate of star formation occurring in the regions with the highest uv surface brightness rises steeply with redshift , and argue that far more uv light may be present in @xmath13 galaxies at fainter , unmeasured isophotal thresholds .",
    "we may partially address this by measuring fluxes and luminosities non  isophotally , e.g. by using apertures scaled by image moments or with fixed metric sizes .",
    "the photometry in figure  8 uses 12  kpc metric apertures , and thus is insensitive to surface brightness limits except as far as they affect galaxy detection in the first place : most faint object cataloging packages use isophotal detection thresholds .",
    "we have examined this by taking wfpc2 images of @xmath140 lbgs , artificially shifting them to higher redshifts , and re  inserting them into the nicmos data to assess their detectability .",
    "galaxies like the @xmath141 lbgs at @xmath9 should be detectable to at least @xmath142 at the depth of our go nicmos images , and more easily in the hdf ",
    "south nicmos field or the hdf  north gto nicmos image , each of which goes @xmath85 magnitude deeper than the data set discussed here . but a general census at such redshifts might indeed be woefully incomplete .    overall , the hdf data disfavor the null hypothesis that galaxies like the bright lbgs at @xmath143 are present at @xmath4 with similar space densities .",
    "the higher redshift galaxies are apparently either fainter , more rare , have lower surface brightness , or some combination thereof . at any rate , they are certainly more difficult to detect and study , at least in abundance , even with nicmos .",
    "although the few @xmath107dropout candidates in the hdf are very faint , paradoxically there is one comparatively bright ` @xmath56dropout ' object , shown in figure  9 .",
    "lanzetta ( 1998 ) identified five possible sources in the kpno @xmath32 images of the hdf which were invisible in the wfpc2 data .",
    "of these , four are undetected by nicmos .",
    "one , however , which we call hdfn ",
    "jd1 , has a robust 1.6@xmath26 m detection ( @xmath144 ) , but is at best only marginally ( @xmath89 ) detected at 1.1@xmath26 m and shorter wavelengths . this optical ` detection , ' if real , would be important , as it would probably exclude the most exotic hypothesis for this object , i.e. , that it is a galaxy or qso at @xmath145",
    "it will be difficult , however , to obtain much deeper optical data than the existing hdf wfpc2 images to provide a stricter limit .",
    "the red @xmath146 color suggests @xmath147 under the high redshift hypothesis , with the ly@xmath14 forest partially suppressing the 160 flux .",
    "we obtained an @xmath148band spectrogram of hdfn ",
    "jd1 with crsp at the kpno 4 m , and to our surprise detected a moderately convincing emission line at 1.65@xmath26 m that could plausibly agree with ly@xmath14 at @xmath149 .",
    "the line did not reproduce , however , in a subsequent reobservation at higher dispersion ( see dickinson 2000 for the spectra and further discussion ) .",
    "if this is not a lyman break object then it may be either heavily reddened and at arbitrary redshift ( but most likely @xmath0 , given the colors ) , or possibly a maximally old elliptical galaxy at @xmath57 ( see  2 ) .",
    "if it is really at @xmath147 , then it is either a galaxy whose unobscured star formation rate ( computed from the uv luminosity ) is several hundred @xmath150  yr@xmath76 , or an agn , perhaps one of the hypothesized population responsible for re  ionizing the universe .",
    "if so , however , such objects are rare at @xmath151 , with a space density several hundred times lower than that of present  day @xmath1 galaxies , and it is unlikely that most of today s galaxies began their life in such a way .    table 1 compares the uv luminosities of some confirmed and candidate galaxies at @xmath152 , compared to that of an @xmath1 lyman break galaxy at @xmath110 . in some cases infrared data needed to measure fluxes at rest frame 1700  are not available , and estimates based on published photometric or spectroscopic fluxes redward of lyman  @xmath14 have been used instead.(1700 ) estimates for rd1 are derived in part from a @xmath56band measurement by armus ( 1998 ) .",

    "can also be identified via their emitted  frame uv light . the evidence from scuba shows that there are occasional ` monsters ' whose obscured star formation may be quite important to the global emissive energy budget from galaxies .",
    "the identification of these objects , relatively rare by number , remains an important dilemma .",
    "broad band color selection has been the most successful means for identifying high redshift galaxies , but we seem to be pushing the limits of what can be accomplished at @xmath131 with present  day capabilities .",
    "the nicmos hdf images are the deepest near ",
    "ir data now available , and they do include plausible candidates for galaxies at @xmath166 , but they are relatively few , and most are quite probably too faint for spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "we probably should not expect to find galaxies much _",
    "brighter _ than these candidates unless some of the ` first ' galaxies were significantly more luminous than the boring old ` later ' galaxies that we have now surveyed extensively at @xmath158 .",
    "this is not impossible of course : the chen object and hdfn  jd1 are both possible ( but unconfirmed ) @xmath131 candidates more luminous than any normal lyman break galaxy at @xmath167 .",
    "perhaps indeed there are very luminous , relatively unobscured proto ",
    "galaxies out there waiting to be found , a hope that was once quite widespread , but which seems to have gradually faded in the modern era of 25th magnitude lbgs and optically invisible scuba sources .",
    "perhaps it will still make a comeback ...    these few rather speculative candidates aside , the evidence from the hdf alone would suggest that the population of uv  bright lbgs may be thinning out at @xmath13 , at least for objects comparable to those at the bright end of the @xmath158 luminosity function .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that this was also the conclusion reached by madau ( 1996 ) at @xmath168 , a result that has since been challenged by larger surveys with extensive spectroscopy .",
    "it is undoubtedly dangerous to draw conclusions too strongly from one 5  arcmin@xmath16 field .",
    "however , extending this work to larger areas and more sightlines will be an expensive effort .",
    "surface brightness dimming and limited solid angle coverage may limit our ability to see much more with nicmos ( assuming that it is successfully revived in 2001 ) , and ground  based near  ir imaging may never go deep enough to detect any but the most luminous objects at @xmath13 .",
    "wider fields imaged with the _ hst _ wfc3 near  ir channel ( coming circa 2004 ) may offer the best survey opportunity until ngst , but a substantial investment of observing time will be needed to survey adequate solid angles to sufficient depth .    alternatively , we may turn to other observing strategies , e.g. , by taking advantage of gravitational lensing from foreground galaxy clusters to boost very distant objects to detectable magnitudes .",

    "these data are offering a first glimpse into the so  called ` dark ages , ' and giving hope that there may be luminous things there to find and study . in some sense , we may not know that we ve found the first galaxies until we can find no more beyond them . holding to that standard will ensure that a more challenging ( and hence , more rewarding ) threshold of proof always lies ahead .",
