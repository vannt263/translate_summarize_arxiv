    "since the pioneer work of perrin  @xcite , sedimentation has become a central tool for investigating the phase behaviour in colloidal systems .",
    "the height - dependent colloidal concentration profile provides a direct measurement of the equation of state for monocomponent systems  @xcite .",
    "sedimentation experiments are also used to extract information from the bulk phase behaviour in binary colloidal mixtures , see e.g. refs .",
    ". however , thermal and gravitational energies are of the same order of magnitude for typical colloidal systems .",
    "this results in additional gravity - induced phenomenology not present in bulk systems .",
    "examples are denser particles floating on top of lighter colloids  @xcite , a nematic layer sandwiched by isotropic layers in mixtures of platelets and spheres  @xcite and mixtures of thin and thick rods  @xcite , and reentrant network formation in mixtures of patchy colloids  @xcite .",
    "it is also common to observe complex stacking sequences in sedimentation with three or more different layers , such as e.g. , in mixtures of charged platelets and polymers  @xcite , plate - plate binary systems  @xcite , mixtures of spheres of different sizes  @xcite , and colloidal rod - plate mixtures  @xcite .",
    "the relation between bulk phase behaviour and sedimentation - diffusion - equilibrium in mixtures is therefore intertwined with gravity - induced effects . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "a generalized archimedes principle was formulated  @xcite for the case where one of the components is very diluted .",
    "sedimentation was also studied by analyzing the macroscopic osmotic equilibrium conditions  @xcite .",
    "recently , de las heras and schmidt have proposed a theory  @xcite for obtaining the stacking diagram , i.e. , the set of all possible stacking sequences under gravity , from the bulk phase diagram of a given binary system .",
    "the theory is based on the concept of sedimentation paths .",
    "each sedimentation path , which is a line in the plane of chemical potentials representation of the bulk phase diagram , describes the state of the mixture under gravity , in sedimentation - diffusion - equilibrium . using this theory the stacking diagrams of mixtures of spheres and platelets  @xcite and mixtures of platelets and nonadsorbing polymers  @xcite were obtained .",
    "also , very recently , van roij and coworkers have obtained the stacking diagrams of mixtures of thin and thick colloidal rods  @xcite .",
    "although in all these cases the bulk phase diagrams of the colloidal systems are relatively simple , the resulting stacking diagrams are extremely rich and show complex stacking sequences .",
    "these works are focused on the limit of very high ( infinite ) sample heights .",
    "this idealized limit is very relevant in experimental work since the height of the test tube is typically larger than the gravitational lengths of the colloids .",
    "the interplay between micro confinement and colloidal sedimentation has been experimentally and theoretically investigated  @xcite .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to the influence of the total ( macroscopic ) sample height in colloidal sedimentation .",
    "a remarkable exception is the experimental work of jamie et al .",
    "@xcite , in which the properties of the gas - fluid interface of a polymer - colloid mixture are analyzed as a function of the overall height of the container . by systematically changing the total sample height while keeping the polymer - colloid concentrations fixed , the interfacial properties were found to move towards the critical point .",
    "theoretically , it has been shown that varying the sample height might led to a change in the stacking sequence in mixtures of colloids and nonadsorbing polymers  @xcite .    here",
    ", we use the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite to study sedimentation - diffusion - equilibrium of colloidal mixtures for the case of finite height samples .",
    "we systematically investigate the role of sample height in the stacking diagrams of colloidal mixtures .",
    "we first apply the theory to model binary systems .",
    "that is , systems with generic bulk phase diagrams typical of model hamiltonian which we however do no explicitly specify . as an application of current interest we also study sedimentation in patchy colloidal mixtures .",
    "patchy colloids are functionalized colloids that interact via a directional and valence - limited potential  @xcite . here",
    ", we use wertheim s theory  @xcite to obtain the bulk behaviour of the mixture .",
    "the two species of the mixture differ in either the number or in the types of patches .",
    "we show that the sample height is a crucial variable in sedimentation - diffusion - equilibrium of colloidal mixtures .",
    "the stacking diagrams for the same mixture but for different sample heights differ not only quantitatively but also qualitatively .",
    "for example , some stacking sequences occur only in a given range of sample heights .",
    "consider a colloidal mixture under gravity in a sedimentation vessel of sample height @xmath0 .",
    "the gravitational potential for each species @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the buoyant mass of species @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the acceleration due to gravity , and @xmath6 is the vertical coordinate ( we set the origin of coordinates , @xmath7 , at the bottom of the sample ) . using a local density approximation  @xcite , we define a height - dependent local chemical potential for @xmath8 for each species @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bulk chemical potential , i.e. the chemical potential in absence of gravity .",
    "the local density approximation assumes that for each @xmath6 the state of the sample is analogous to a bulk system ( no gravity ) with chemical potentials given by  .",
    "this constitutes a very good approximation provided that the correlation lengths are small compared to the gravitational lengths , @xmath11 with @xmath12 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath13 the absolute temperature . combining the expressions for the local chemical potentials , cf .  , and",
    "eliminating the height variable @xmath6 we find @xmath14 where both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants given by @xmath17 the finite size of the sample @xmath8 is translated into a range for the local chemical potentials @xmath18 eqs .   and",
    "represent a line segment , which we refer to as the sedimentation path , in the plane of chemical potentials .",
    "the sedimentation path describes how the local chemical potentials vary along the height coordinate in the vessel .",
    "each point in the sedimentation path corresponds to the state of the sample at a given @xmath6 .",
    "the sedimentation path is directly related to the stacking sequence , i.e. , the sequence of stacks of different phases that appear under gravity .",
    "if a path crosses a boundary between two phases in the phase diagram , e.g. , a binodal , an interface appears in the vessel .",
    "the sedimentation path provides a direct link between the bulk phase diagram of the mixture and the stacking sequence .",
    "an example of a sedimentation path and its corresponding stacking sequence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "a sedimentation path is fully described by its ( i ) slope , ( ii ) location in the @xmath19 plane specified by a point on the path , ( iii ) direction and ( iv ) length .",
    "the slope is fixed by the ratio of the buoyant masses , cf .  .",
    "the position is determined by the bulk chemical potentials in absence of gravity , and hence by the overall colloidal composition and concentration via a change of variables using the equation of state of the mixture .",
    "the direction is given by the signs of the buoyant masses ( note @xmath3 can be negative if the mass density of the solvent is higher than the mass density of the colloids ) . finally , the length of the path is proportional to the height of the vessel since the difference in chemical potentials between the top ( @xmath20 ) and the bottom of the sample ( @xmath7 ) is @xmath21      we have shown how each sedimentation path is associated to a stacking sequence .",
    "the phase stacking diagram is the set of all possible stacking sequences for a given mixture .    * infinite height*. for standard colloidal particles in typical sedimentation vessels the length of the sedimentation path is of several @xmath22 in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "that is , the path extends over a big region of the bulk phase diagram of the mixture .",
    "hence , a very relevant idealization is to consider the limit of very high ( infinite ) sample heights . within this limit",
    "@xcite a sedimentation path is a straight line of infinite length ( not a line segment ) in the plane of chemical potentials .",
    "hence , a sedimentation path can be fully described by using only the slope of the path @xmath16 , and the crossing point between the path and the @xmath23 axis @xmath15 , cf . .",
    "the stacking diagram can then be represented in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "there are three types of boundaries between different stacking sequences in the stacking diagram . here",
    "we only describe each one briefly , see  @xcite for a full account :    \\(i ) _ sedimentation binodals . _",
    "the set of all sedimentation paths tangent to a binodal in the bulk phase diagram is a boundary between two phases in the stacking diagram .",
    "the path labeled as ( 1 ) in fig .  [ fig1 ] is an example .",
    "an infinitesimally small change in one or in both variables of the path , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , can change the stacking sequence .",
    "\\(ii ) _ terminal lines . _",
    "the set of all paths crossing an ending point of a binodal in the bulk phase diagram is a boundary in the stacking diagram that we call the terminal line . the sedimentation path ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is an example .",
    "an infinitesimal change of @xmath15 changes the stacking sequence .",
    "an ending point can be e.g. a critical point , triple point , critical end point , etc .",
    "\\(iii ) _ asymptotic terminal lines . _ the third type of boundaries in the stacking diagram is formed by those paths that are parallel to the asymptotic behaviour of a binodal . see the path ( 3 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this case",
    "an infinitesimal change of the slope @xmath16 alters the stacking sequence .",
    "a binodal is not the only possible boundary between two regions present in the bulk phase diagram .",
    "for example , a percolating line dividing the bulk phase diagram into percolated and nonpercolated states is another type of a boundary between phases .",
    "any boundary present in the bulk phase diagram generates boundaries in the stacking diagram ( sedimentation binodals , terminal lines and asymptotic terminal lines ) . for convenience",
    "we speak always of binodal but one should bear in mind that other lines also give rise to boundaries in the stacking diagram .",
    "the patchy colloid mixtures studied below feature such percolation lines .    * finite height*. in this paper we focus on the stacking diagrams for finite height samples .",
    "there exist several possibilities to represent the stacking diagram for finite heights . in an experimental work one",
    "typically varies the concentration and composition of the mixture , while keeping the solvent and the mass density of the colloids unchanged .",
    "the sample height is , in principle , easy to adjust   and hence forms a useful control parameter . under these circumstances",
    "the slope and the length of the path in the @xmath19 plane are fixed , cf .   and  , and its position in the @xmath19 plane varies",
    ". a sensible choice of variables for the stacking diagram is the plane of average local chemical potentials along the path @xmath25 . as the sedimentation paths are straight lines , the average local chemical potentials are just the local chemical potential evaluated at the middle of the sample @xmath26 .",
    "the stacking diagram for finite height samples in the @xmath25 plane contains three possible types of boundaries between different stacking sequences .",
    "two of them are sedimentation binodals originated from coexisting lines in the bulk phase diagrams and one boundary is due to the ending points of the binodals .",
    "we describe each of them in detail in the following .",
    "\\(i ) _ sedimentation binodal type i _ ( sbi ) .",
    "the set of all sedimentation paths that either start or end at a binodal form a sedimentation binodal of type i. a path starts ( ends ) at a binodal if the bottom ( top ) of the sample is located at the binodal .",
    "the path labeled as ( 1 ) in fig .  [ fig2 ] is an example . for each binodal in the bulk phase diagram",
    "there are two corresponding sbi in the stacking diagram .",
    "one sbi for those paths that end at the binodal and the other one sbi for those paths that start at the binodal .",
    "both sbi lines have the same shape as the bulk binodal .",
    "this type of boundary is not present in the case of infinite height because the paths do not have starting and ending points .",
    "let @xmath27 be the parameterization of the chemical potential of species @xmath28 at a bulk coexistence line , such as a binodal , as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "then , the two corresponding sedimentation binodals of type i are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 here , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the local chemical potential of species @xmath34 at the bottom ( top ) of the sample .",
    "\\(ii ) _ sedimentation binodal type ii _ ( sbii ) .",
    "the set of all paths tangent to a bulk binodal is also a boundary ( sedimentation binodal type ii ) in the stacking diagram .",
    "see the path ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "this boundary is analogous to the sedimentation binodals in the case of infinite height .",
    "the sbii boundaries are straight lines in the stacking diagram .",
    "a sbii line is present if and only if the slope of the path is the same as the slope of the binodal at same point(s ) .",
    "each point of a binodal sharing the same slope as the path generates a sbii line .",
    "let @xmath35 be the chemical potentials of a point on a bulk binodal .",
    "let its local slope be that of the sedimentation path .",
    "that is @xmath36 then , the associated sbii line is given by @xmath37 the finite size of the path limits the range of @xmath38 to @xmath39    \\(iii ) _ terminal lines _",
    "the terminal lines are , as in the infinite height case , the set of all paths that cross an ending point of a binodal .",
    "see path ( 3 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for each ending point in the bulk phase diagram there is one and only one tl in the stacking diagram .",
    "the tl is always a straight line .",
    "let @xmath40 be the chemical potentials of an ending point in bulk , such as a critical point , a triple point , etc .",
    "the corresponding terminal line is @xmath41 for @xmath42    in the three cases ( i),(ii ) , and ( iii ) any infinitesimal displacement of the path changes the stacking sequence ( except for the special case in which the displacement is such that the path moves along the boundary of the stacking diagram ) .",
    "the asymptotic terminal lines that occur in the case of infinite sample height do not appear at finite height since the slope of the sedimentation path is fixed and the paths are of finite length .",
    "the three boundaries sbi , sbii , and tl divide the stacking diagram in different regions .",
    "each region corresponds to a different stacking sequence . in order to identify each sequence we first select one point inside of the desired region .",
    "next we plot the corresponding path in the bulk phase diagram such that we can determine the sequence by inspecting the crossings between the path and the binodals .",
    "once the stacking diagram has been calculated in the @xmath25 plane , we can easily transform to any other set of variables provided that the equation of state of the mixture is known . in order to ease comparison to experimental work ,",
    "a sensible choice of variables for the stacking diagram is the @xmath43 plane , where @xmath44 is the average packing fraction of species @xmath4 , @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the local packing fraction of species @xmath4 at a distance @xmath6 from the bottom of the sample . to obtain @xmath46",
    "we first compute the local chemical potentials at @xmath6 using eq .",
    ", and then use the equation of state of the system @xmath47 .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath43 plane is then obtained by transforming the coordinates of the boundaries in the stacking diagram from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "other representations of the stacking diagram such as for example average osmotic pressure versus average composition are also possible , following a similar transformation procedure .",
    "we first apply our theory to obtain the stacking diagrams at finite height of different bulk model phase diagrams ( sec .  [ aaa ] ) .",
    "although the bulk phase diagrams do not correspond to real microscopic models , they are representative of the behaviour of typical colloidal mixtures .",
    "the model bulk phase diagrams provide relevant examples of possible topologies of the stacking diagrams . in sec .",
    "[ bbb ] we apply the theory to model binary mixtures of patchy colloids for which we use wertheim s theory to obtain the bulk phase diagram . finally , in sec .",
    "[ ccc ] we compare the stacking diagrams at finite and infinite sample heights .",
    "one of the simplest possible bulk phase diagrams of a binary mixture is schematically represented in fig .",
    "there is a single binodal at which two phases a and b coexist .",
    "the binodal ends at a critical point .",
    "the species @xmath28 undergoes an a - b phase transition .",
    "hence , the binodal has a horizontal asymptote and tends to the value of @xmath23 at the transition ( chosen as @xmath50 ) .",
    "this phase diagram might be representative of e.g. a mixture of spherical colloids ( species @xmath34 ) and anisotropic colloids undergoing an isotropic - nematic phase transition ( species @xmath28 ) .",
    "a small degree of polydispersity in the spherical colloids could prevent a liquid - solid phase transition in the pure system of species @xmath34  .",

    "@xcite . here",
    "we focus on the case of finite height . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we represent the stacking diagram ( @xmath25 plane ) for two different heights @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 . in both cases",

    "we show representative sedimentation paths in fig .",
    "each sedimentation path in the @xmath19 plane in the bulk diagram is a point in the @xmath55 plane of the stacking diagram ( the coordinates of the middle point of the path ) .",
    "the stacking diagrams contain two sedimentation binodals of type i ( generated by paths starting and ending at the bulk binodal ) and one terminal line ( paths crossing the critical point ) .",
    "there are three possible stacking sequences , namely a , b , and ab . we label the sequences according to the order of different stacks from bottom to top .",

    "the slope of the path is , in this case , compatible with the slope of the binodal in the sense that there is one point at the binodal whose derivative equals the slope of the path , cf .  .",
    "hence , the stacking diagram contains a sedimentation binodal of type ii which is formed by the set of paths that are tangent to the binodal in bulk .",
    "the boundaries of the stacking diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]d ) are : two sdi lines , one sdii line , and one tl .",
    "these boundaries split the stacking diagram into five regions .",
    "the possible stacking sequences are a , b , ab , aba , and ba  .",
    "the aba sequence appears when a path crosses the bulk binodal twice  @xcite .",
    "this very simple example already shows the richness of the stacking diagram .",
    "it also suggests that the sample height plays a major role .",
    "the size of the area of the stacking diagrams occupied by each stacking sequence depends strongly on the height of the sample .",
    "for example , the ab region substantially increases with @xmath0 , cf .",
    "two samples of different height and different stacking sequences might have the same composition and concentration of colloids ( we will see examples in the next section ) .",
    "the height of the sample might have an even stronger influence on the stacking diagram , as we will demonstrate in the following .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a we show a further model bulk phase diagram .",
    "there are three different phases : a , b and c. three binodals for a - b , a - c , and b - c coexistence meet at a triple point .",
    "a phase diagram like this might represent a mixture in which the species @xmath34 represents spherical colloids and the species @xmath28 consists of e.g. , elongated colloidal particles .",
    "the elongated particles can undergo isotropic - nematic and nematic - smectic phase transitions .",
    "the stacking diagrams for this mixture are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b for two different heights , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath59 . in both cases",
    "the slope of the path is @xmath60 and both buoyant masses are positive .",
    "the boundaries in the stacking diagram are : six sdi lines ( two for each of the three binodals ) , one sdii line ( the slope of the path matches the slope of the b - c binodal at one point ) , and one tl line ( originating from the triple point ) .",
    "the stacking diagrams for heights @xmath51 and @xmath52 differ substantially from each other , see left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , respectively .",
    "we observe two main differences between the diagrams for short and long samples :    first , the sedimentation paths for the small system ( @xmath51 ) fit in the space between the a - b and b - c binodals of the bulk phase diagram , see an example in fig .",
    "consequently the stacking sequence b occurs in the stacking diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ( left ) .",
    "in contrast , the stacking sequence b does not occur in the large samples ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the b sequence is replaced by an abc state , fig .",

    "the sedimentation paths in this case are long enough such that they do not fit in the region between the a - b and b - c binodals in bulk . instead",
    ", the path must cross at least one of the binodals .",
    "second , the sequence cabc is generated by paths crossing the three binodals in bulk .",

    "the paths corresponding to the short samples ( @xmath51 ) are not long enough to cross the three binodals , and hence the cabc sequence is absent .",

    "some stacking sequences are replaced by others ( e.g. the b sequence for @xmath51 is replaced by abc for @xmath52 ) and one also observes the occurrence of new sequences , such as the cabc sequence for @xmath52 .",

    "for example , the sequence mg@xmath90 ( number @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) is only present in samples with @xmath70 mm , and the sequence g@xmath89mg@xmath90 m ( number @xmath72 ) occurs only for the case @xmath76 mm .",
    "we conclude the section with several comments regarding the connection between the stacking diagrams for infinite and finite samples .",
    "the main effect is the occurrence of new sequences in the case of finite height samples .",
    "the new sequences are formed by the removal of one or more stacks of the sequences for @xmath91 . in general",
    ", a sequence observed at finite height might be a truncated sequence of the infinite system .",
    "this observation has strong implications for the correct interpretation of observed stacking sequences in finite height samples .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the stacking diagram ( infinite height ) of the mixture of patchy colloids with two and three patches analyzed in sec .  [ 23 m ] .",
    "the stacking diagram is represented in the @xmath24 plane , cf  .",
    "the diagram has been computed for @xmath57 .",
    "hence positive ( negative ) values of the slope @xmath92 correspond to positive ( negative ) values of @xmath93 .",
    "there exists an analogous diagram for @xmath94 in which the only difference is that the stacking sequences have the reverse order .",
    "there are two sedimentation binodals ( one for the binodal and one for the percolation line ) , two terminal lines ( critical point of the binodal and ending point of the percolation point ) , and two asymptotic terminal lines ( asymptotic behaviour of the binodal and the percolation lines ) .",
    "we have shown previously the diagrams at finite height for the slope @xmath95 , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for this value of @xmath16",
    "only three sequences are possible at infinite height , see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] : . the finite height diagram is richer with up to six different sequences .",
    "these are the same three as for @xmath91 and three new truncated sequences of the infinite case ( g , n , and g - g ) .",
    "as expected , by increasing the height of the sample , the regions occupied by the new truncated sequences in the stacking diagrams shrink ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6]d ) . in this particular example , for @xmath75 mm , the stacking diagram is already dominated by the stacking sequences of the infinite height case .",
    "the infinite height stacking diagram provides the set of possible sequences for different values of @xmath16 . here , we have only analysed the value @xmath95 of the slope for finite height samples .",
    "the infinite height stacking diagram shows that for other values of @xmath16 further complex phenomenology occurs .",
    "for example , for negative values of the slope , i.e. @xmath58 , it is possible to stabilize the sequence ngn - g which constitutes a reentrant percolation phenomena .",
    "this sequence also occurs in two - dimensional binary mixtures of patchy colloids  @xcite .",
    "experimentally one can change the slope of the path via the synthesis of colloids with cores of different materials  @xcite or changing the mass density of the solvent .",
    "hence , the full range of stacking sequences of a given colloidal mixture is , in principle , experimentally accessible .",
    "our theory is based on a local density approximation which assumes that for each @xmath6 the state of the sample can be approximated by a bulk state .",
    "non - local effects might modify the stacking diagrams .",
    "in particular , the theory neglects the surface tension of the interfaces between stacks in the stacking sequence .",
    "if one of the stacks is very narrow the surface tension of the upper and lower interfaces might be higher than the gain in free energy due to the formation of the stack , as observed in colloid - polymer model mixtures  @xcite . under such circumstances ,",
    "the final equilibrium stacking sequence might be different than that predicted by our local theory .",
    "this condition is analogue of capillary condensation / evaporation .",
    "surface effects such as e.g. , the occurrence of wetting and layering near the walls of the vessel might also modify the stacking diagrams .    our theory can be easily extended to multicomponent systems since the sedimentation paths remain lines in the phase space of chemical potentials . also",
    ", the theory is directly applicable to molecular systems .",
    "there , the gravitational lengths are orders of magnitude higher than in colloidal systems . hence , to observe similar phenomenology one needs containers of considerable size , such as for example geological deposits .",
    "we have obtained the stacking diagrams at constant sample height and fixed ratio of the buoyant masses .",
    "other choices , such as for example keeping the colloidal concentrations fixed and varying the sample height , are also possible . a stacking diagram in which one of the variables is the height might be relevant to study the effects of slow solvent evaporation , which is a process that changes the total volume but keeps the particle number fixed .",
    "we have shown that two samples with the same colloidal concentrations but placed in vessels of different heights might have different stacking sequences .",
    "we have also shown that the stacking diagrams might be qualitatively different for different heights .",
    "therefore , the sample height plays a major role in sedimentation - diffusion - equilibrium experiments .",
    "this role is as important as for example the average colloidal concentrations .",
    "we conclude that the sample height should be carefully measured and specified in any sedimentation experiment .",
    "we have focused on sedimentation - diffusion - equilibrium in colloidal mixtures .",
    "future studies could consider the dynamics of sedimentation using dynamic density functional theory  @xcite and power functional theory  @xcite .",
    "we thank matthias schmidt for very useful discussions and a careful reading of the manuscript .",
