    "the study of the functional properties of hermite series is in many cases a difficult problem .",

    "the case @xmath24 was treated by janssen and van eijndhoven  @xcite .",
    "more anecdotically , the decrease of the hermite coefficients of a certain function has been related to properties of the riemann @xmath25 function by grawe in  @xcite .",
    "finally , langenbruch  @xcite has treated the problem starting from a slightly different definition for the function spaces ( conditions of the type @xmath26 ) ; in fact a part of his proofs could be adapted and reused here .",

    "the main result in this paper is theorem  [ theo : mainhermite ] in   [ sec : mainhermite ] .",
    "the next question occurs when one considers a so - called mixed state : that is , the statistical result of a physical experiment where there is an uncertainty on the quantum state itself . let us say that , with probabilities @xmath27 , the experiment produces orthogonal states @xmath28 .",
    "all this information is contained in the operator @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the projector on the subspace generated by @xmath31 .",
    "if more than one of the @xmath32 is non - zero , then the state is called _ mixed_. in other words , a pure state is one that can be described by a single wave functions : for instance @xmath33 .",
    "it is easily seen , as in leonhardt s reference book  @xcite , that @xmath34 is hermitian , that its eigenvalues are nonnegative with a sum @xmath35 , and that these conditions are sufficient to make a mixed quantum state .    for a more graphic representation",
    ", one can also consider the _ wigner distribution _ associated to @xmath34 .",
    "it is a function of two variables @xmath36 ( or rather , a function of @xmath37 ) , defined as @xmath38 for some reasons , it is sometimes easier to work with @xmath39 the transform @xmath40 is an isometry between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; its inverse is called the _ _ weyl transform__. the wigner distribution is very useful for the interpretation of experiments , such as in quantum homodyne tomography ( _ op .",
    "_ , see also the lectures notes edited by paris and ehek  @xcite ) .    for a pure state @xmath43 , or in terms of operators , @xmath44 , the wigner representation of @xmath45",
    "is given by a simpler form of  ( [ eq : wignerdistribution ] ) called the _ wigner transform _ of @xmath43 , which is the quadratic form @xmath46 then there is no difficulty to see that @xmath47 and that @xmath48 ; this is what makes this representation useful in quantum mechanics , for it allows to recover the probability distribution of an observable and its dual ( _ e.g. _ positition and momentum , electric and magnetic field  ) as marginal distributions of the wigner transform of @xmath43 ( even though @xmath49 , being in general non - positive , is not a probability density _ stricto sensu _ ) .",
    "another consequence is that , generally speaking , a decrease condition on @xmath49 implies a decrease condition on both @xmath43 and @xmath50 .",
    "from the results of    [ sec : hermiteexpansion ] , this implies a decrease condition on the hermite coefficients of @xmath43 : the object of    [ sec : wd ] is to show that the converse is true .",
    "this result can be extended to mixed states in the following manner : let @xmath51 $ ] be the ( infinite ) _ density matrix _ of @xmath34 in the fock basis .",
    "for instance , in the case of a pure state @xmath52 , @xmath53 assuming that @xmath54 decreases ultrarapidly when @xmath55 , we shall show that @xmath56 also decreases ultrarapidly when @xmath57 . however , in ",
    "[ sec : mixedstates ] we see that there are ( necessarily mixed ) states for which @xmath56 decreases ultrarapidly but not @xmath54 .",
    "another object of interest is @xmath58 , the 2-dimensional fourier transform of @xmath56 . in radar technology , this function is known as the _ ambiguity function_. its decrease rate rules the regularity of @xmath56 , which is of importance in statistical estimation , see butucea _",

    "similarly , we define @xmath61 these functions , named _ special hermite functions _ by strichartz  @xcite , are remarkable .",
    "although they are not exactly 2-dimensional hermite functions ( the latter being defined by tensor product @xmath62 ) , special hermite functions are a special linear combination ( for @xmath63 ) of those .",
    "consequently , they are also eigenfunctions for the 2-dimensional fourier transform : @xmath64    let us now expose our frame of work .",
    "because of ( [ eq : fourierhermite ] ) , any function space for which the fock states ( hermite functions ) form an unconditional basis must be invariant under fourier transform .",
    "such spaces can be defined by weighted @xmath65 conditions on both @xmath7 and @xmath66 , as follows .",
