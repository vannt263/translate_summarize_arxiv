    "interplay between disorder and superconductivity has been at the focus of attention for quite a long time .",
    "more than four decades ago , it has been established that the effect of weak disorder on superconductivity is not substantial.@xcite strong disorder , however , may have a profound effect , driving the system from a superconducting ( sc ) to an insulating state .",
    "such a superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) was observed in two - dimensional amorphous sc films . @xcite upon decreasing the film thickness or increasing a perpendicular magnetic field , these films ( which are held below their bulk critical temperature ) exhibit a transition from a sc state , characterized by a vanishing resistance as @xmath0 , to an insulating state , in which the resistance diverges as @xmath1 .",
    "of tuning the system continuously between these two extreme phases a manifestation of a quantum phase transition ( which , strictly speaking , occurs at zero temperature).@xcite    despite the substantial amount of experimental data , and numerous theoretical investigations , there are still several unresolved issues pertaining to the physics of these systems .",
    "one of the main puzzles is the mechanism by which the magnetic field destroys the sc correlations .",
    "regards the sit as a transition into a bose - glass phase , in which the pairing amplitude is finite in the sample but its phase is strongly fluctuating , giving rise to an insulating state .",
    "such a phase is characterized by a pair - vortex duality , and its hallmark is a universal value for the resistance @xmath2 at the transition . while some experiments are consistent with that prediction,@xcite others are not.@xcite beside the issue of universal resistance , there are other observations which can not be simply explained by the dirty boson model , for instance , the temperature dependence of the crossing point and the classical xy critical exponent.@xcite    the role of the large fluctuations in the local sc gap , @xmath3 , and the formation of sc islands have been emphasized in several other works .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "the authors predict the existence of such islands by calculating the mesoscopic fluctuations of the order - parameter at the mean - field level .",
    "since phase fluctuations are ignored by mean - field calculations , it was pointed out that there is no real sc transition within that approximation .",
    "later it has been shown @xcite that inclusion of quantum fluctuations ( beyond mean field ) indeed results in a quantum phase - transition .",
    "a detailed mean - field study of sc correlations in disordered two - dimensional films has been presented in ref .  , employing a locally self - consistent solution of the mean - field bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations @xcite at finite temperature and at zero magnetic field .",
    "it was indeed found that disorder induces strong fluctuations of @xmath3 in space , resulting in regions with large order parameter ( here interpreted as sc islands - scis ) , separated by regions of vanishingly small order parameter .",
    "the role of temperature is found @xcite to be similar to that of disorder .",
    "recently we have incorporated thermal phase fluctuations beyond the bdg theory,@xcite and have demonstrated the formation of isolated scis within the two - dimensional disordered negative - u hubbard model : increasing magnetic field leads to the loss of sc phase correlations between different areas in the sample and an eventual sit .",
    "the island picture is very helpful in explaining some of the experimental puzzles .",
    "the coexistence and competition between cooper pair and electron ( or quasi - particle ) transport give rise to the non - universality of the critical resistance .",
    "it can also explain@xcite the non - monotonic magneto - resistance behavior observed on the insulating side of the sit.@xcite the theory also predicts the persistence of the sc islands into the insulating phase .",
    "such sc correlations in the insulating phase have been observed experimentally by using ac transport ( and measuring the superfluid stiffness on the insulating phase ) @xcite and by aharonov - bohm interference ( where oscillations with period @xmath4 in the magnetoresistance were observed in the magneto - resistance on the insulating phase , indicating the presence of cooper pairs ) .",
    "@xcite    in this picture , the approach to the sit from the insulating side is governed by the emergence of phase correlations between the islands as temperature or magnetic field are lowered , eventually resulting in a macroscopically coherent sample .",
    "this picture is in agreement with the ( quantum ) percolation scenario.@xcite evidence for percolation - like behavior is substantiated in several experiments.@xcite interestingly , the theory also demonstrated that phase correlations between different islands may be explored _ even within mean - field theory _ , by looking at the response to parallel ( zeeman ) magnetic field ( see below ) .",
    "thus , in principle , the sit can also be investigated by solving the bdg equation in a finite magnetic field . in this work , however , we focus on the effects of magnetic field on the formation and evolution of sc islands in highly disordered two - dimensional sc systems in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "( we separate the effects of magnetic field into orbital field and zeeman field , which we sometimes refer to as perpendicular and parallel fields , even though each of the latter leads to both orbital and zeeman effects . )",
    "the structure of this paper and the main achievements are listed below . in section  [ model ] the model and method of calculations are briefly described . in section",
    "[ orbital ] the role of perpendicular magnetic fields is studied ( assumed to act on the orbital degrees of freedom as mentioned above ) . in particular , it is found that , as the field is increased , the size of the sc islands shrinks and the strength of the local order parameter diminishes .",
    "it is explicitly shown that vortices are formed and their disorder - induced pinning is analyzed . moreover , these vortices tend to accumulate in places where , in the absence of magnetic field , the order parameter was low ( that is in the `` normal regions '' of the sample ) .",
    "the presence of these vortices suppresses the josephson couplings between the scis , leading eventually to completely decoupled islands .",
    "section  [ formation ] is devoted to examining the role of a parallel magnetic field , manifested by a zeeman splitting .",
    "it is found that at low temperatures and weak orbital magnetic fields , weakly disordered systems exhibit an abrupt vanishing of the sc order parameter in response to increasing parallel field , resembling a first order transition , as expected for a uniform system.@xcite on the other hand , when either temperature , disorder , or the orbital field are increased , the system undergoes a series of transitions , as a function of parallel field , corresponding to the sequential vanishing of @xmath3 on separate islands , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the emergence of local magnetic order in areas where superconductivity is destroyed is demonstrated . in section  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "in this section , the model and method of calculations are briefly introduced .",
    "the starting point is the effective tight - binding bdg hamiltonian @xcite on a square lattice , @xmath5~~ , \\label { eq : effhamil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum @xmath6 runs on nearest neighbors , @xmath7 are random site energies taken from a uniform distribution @xmath8 $ ] , with @xmath9 being the disorder strength , @xmath10 is the local hartree - shifted chemical potential , ( _ i ) = -|u| c_ic_iis the local pairing potential and @xmath11 is an effective electron - electron on - site attractive interaction.@xcite the orbital magnetic field enters via the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath12 . in the landau gauge it can be written within the peierls substitution rule as t_ij = t_0 ( -i y_i ) [ hopping ] if @xmath13 is in the @xmath14-direction , and @xmath15 otherwise . in eq .",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the magnetic flux per plaquette , @xmath18 is the flux quantum , and @xmath19 is the @xmath20-direction coordinate ( in units of lattice spacing ) .",
    "hereafter , @xmath21 is set to unity and serves as reference to all other energy scales .",
    "using a bogoliubov transformation one can diagonalize @xmath22 exactly and obtain the bdg equations , (    cc & + ^ * & -^ * +    ) (    c u_n(_i ) + v_n(_i ) +    ) = e_n (    c u_n(_i ) + v_n(_i ) +    )  .",
    "[ eq : bdg ] in eq .  , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and similarly for @xmath26 , and the energies are the quasi - particle ( qp ) excitation energies @xmath27 .",
    "the pairing potential @xmath28 and the electron density per site @xmath29 are given , in terms of the qp amplitudes @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32    in what follows , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdg ] ) is solved numerically on a finite ( albeit large ) two - dimensional square lattice with hard - wall boundary conditions , starting with some initial guesses for @xmath33 and @xmath29 . @xmath33 and @xmath29 are then determined via eq .  , and the procedure is repeated until self - consistency is obtained _ on each site_. in order to be able to compare the same system at different magnetic fields , the chemical potential is altered in every iteration such that the total average density per site @xmath34 remains constant ( @xmath35 being the total number of sites in the lattice ) .",
    "we start by examining the effect of an orbital magnetic field on the pairing potential @xmath3 . in ref .",
    "it was argued that the scis diminish in size and may even vanish as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "this assumption is indeed confirmed by the numerical results .",
    "figure  [ d(r , b ) ] depicts the spatial distribution of the order parameter amplitude , @xmath36 , in the two - dimensional system , for three different values of the magnetic field . at zero magnetic field",
    "the order parameter fluctuates in space due to disorder , assuming larger values ( bright areas in fig .",
    "[ d(r , b ) ] ) in places where the effective local potential is small , i.e. , @xmath37 , @xcite which facilitates fluctuations between 0 and 2 electrons on the site .",
    "these areas are separated by regions with small order parameter ( dark areas in fig .",
    "[ d(r , b ) ] ) and hence constitute `` superconducting islands '' ( as will be shown in following sections ) . as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , the size of these islands and the strength of the order parameter diminishes , and some scis virtually disappear ( that is , at very strong fields the order parameter there becomes smaller than the numerical tolerance ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that while the average value of the order parameter diminishes by nearly @xmath38 when the flux is increased from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , the maximal value of the order parameter drops by less than @xmath41 , meaning that the concept of `` sc islands '' persist well within the strong field region ( it is the loss of correlations between the islands that drives the system into its normal state ) .     for different values of the orbital magnetic field , @xmath42 .",
    "bright regions , corresponding to large values of @xmath43 , constitute `` superconducting islands '' , separated by regions of small @xmath43 ( dark regions ) . increasing magnetic field",
    "leads to attenuation of the sc order parameter and even to the vanishing of sc order in some areas of the sample .",
    "calculation is performed on a @xmath44 size lattice with electron density @xmath45 , disorder strength @xmath46 and interaction strength @xmath47 ( this value for @xmath48 is maintained throughout ) . ]",
    "the distribution function of the order parameter amplitude , @xmath49 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ d(b ) ] for different values of the magnetic field .",
    "as can be seen , the distribution function shifts from being peaked around some finite initial value to being peaked at @xmath50 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in the inset of fig .",
    "[ d(b ) ] the average order parameter amplitude @xmath54 is plotted as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "we note that ( i ) in a finite lattice latexmath:[$\\langle    realization , @xmath54 may be a non - monotonic function of @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , in a clean system @xmath54 has been shown to oscillate as a function of magnetic field.@xcite disorder , however , tends to smear the non - monotonicity , and upon averaging over disorder realizations one obtains a monotonically decreasing function .",
    "another illustration of the interplay between disorder and magnetic field is manifested in the location of the vortices . in a clean system one",
    "expects the vortices to form a regular abrikosov lattice .",
    "however , strong disorder modifies the position of vortices , as they are pinned within regions where the amplitude of the order parameter has a small value . in figure  [ vortices0 ]",
    "the phase of the sc order parameter is plotted for different values of the magnetic field corresponding to the consecutive insertion of one additional flux quantum into the system . as can be seen",

    "arrows point at the positions of the vortices . for each number of flux quanta ,",
    "a similar number of vortices is formed , their position is irregular and determined by the disorder potential . ]    these correlations can be exposed more clearly . in figure  [ vortices ] the order parameter amplitude at zero field is plotted ( fig .  [ vortices](a ) ) , together with the phase of the order parameter ( fig .",
    "[ vortices](b ) ) , for the same system as in figure  [ vortices0 ] with two flux quanta .",
    "as can be seen , the vortex cores are positioned where the amplitude is low ( dark regions in ( a ) ) , i.e. , they are `` pinned '' to regions with low order parameter .",
    "the emerging interactions between vortices still play a significant role , as , for example , the second vortex that enters the system changes the position of the first one .    in ref .",
    "it was shown that the sit is driven by loss of phase - coherence between the sc phases on different islands .",
    "the fact that vortices appear in regions of low order parameter amplitude , i.e. in between the sc islands , is consistent with the picture that orbital magnetic field causes loss of phase coherence between the islands : the effective josephson coupling between the islands is reduced with increasing magnetic field , until the josephson energy becomes smaller than temperature ( or the amount of quantum phase fluctuations ) and the islands decouple .          in the previous subsection",
    "the roles of disorder and orbital magnetic field in generating fluctuations in the amplitude of the sc order parameter have been demonstrated .",
    "however , the question remains whether these fluctuations may be regarded as separated sc islands .",
    "here we demonstrate how the zeeman effect resulting from an application of a parallel magnetic field helps to answer this question .",
    "this is carried out by extending our previous calculations,@xcite and include the electron spin through the zeeman effect .",
    "when a parallel magnetic field is applied , the single electron levels split .",
    "it was shown a long time ago @xcite that upon applying a parallel field , a uniform superconductor undergoes a first - order transition .",
    "the reason for this transition is simple : superconductivity requires occupation of paired spin up and spin down states , which becomes costly with increasing zeeman energy . for a single pair ,",
    "one expects the transition to take place when the gain from superconductivity , @xmath58 , ( the bulk value of the order parameter ) , is overcome by zeeman energy , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the strength of the parallel field , @xmath61 being the g - factor for electrons and @xmath62 is the bohr magneton .",
    "in fact , when correlation effects are taken into account , one finds that the transition from superconductivity to a magnetically aligned state occurs at @xmath63 .",
    "for ultra - small isolated sc grains it was shown @xcite that a finite size effect ( manifested in a level spacing of the order of @xmath58 ) may smooth the otherwise sharp transition .    in order to account for the effect of parallel field",
    ", a zeeman splitting term @xmath64 is added to the hamiltonian of eq .  .",
    "the bogoliubov transformation now has to be performed with spin - dependent quasi - particle amplitudes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which now obey the spin - generalized bdg equations , @xcite (    cc h & + ^ * & -^ * h +    ) (    c u_n ( _ i ) + v_n ( _ i ) +    ) = ( e_n h ) (    c u_n ( _ i ) + v_n ( _ i ) +    )  .",
    "[ eq : bdg_spin ] once these equations are solved , the local pairing potential and occupation are determined by self - consistent equations similar to that of eq .  .",
    "note that for singlet ( s - wave ) pairing , the different spin - generalized quasi - particle amplitudes are decoupled , and the coupling between the different spins enters only in the determination of the self - consistent hartree shift and order parameter .    for a clean or weakly disordered system and for parallel field strength @xmath67 ,",
    "the eigenvectors are independent of @xmath68 ( due to the simple dependence of the energies on the zeeman term ) , and hence the solution for the pairing amplitude @xmath69 and the local occupation is unchanged . on the other hand , for @xmath70 a solution with @xmath71 yields a lower free energy .",
    "thus , one should observe a step - like behavior of the order parameter .",
    "in contrast , in a disordered system , as @xmath69 varies in space , one also expects @xmath72 to be space - dependent . for a system composed of separated scis",
    ", one thus expects that the order parameter on each island will vanish when @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is an index for identifying the corresponding island ) .",
    "thus , the vanishing of the average value of @xmath3 is expected to exhibit multiple steps , each step corresponds to the vanishing of superconductivity in a different island .    in figure  [ d_parallel ] the average order parameter amplitude @xmath54 is plotted as a function of @xmath68 for different orbital fields .",
    "one can clearly see that for small @xmath17 ( weak perpendicular magnetic field ) , the system undergoes a single sharp transition .",
    "in contrast , for finite values of @xmath17 , step structure of @xmath54 is indeed visible .",
    "this is seen more clearly in the inset of figure  [ d_parallel ] where @xmath75 , with much higher resolution in @xmath68 . at this resolution ,",
    "the step - like behavior is seen even for this high value of the orbital field .",
    "thus , large orbital field suppresses sc correlations between the islands .",
    "they seem to lose sc order separately and successively , depending on the specific value of the gap for each sci .     as a function of the zeeman splitting @xmath68 for different values of orbital magnetic field , @xmath76 . for small @xmath55 ,",
    "the system undergoes a first - order transition , which is smoothed as @xmath55 increases . for @xmath77 steps in @xmath54",
    "are visible .",
    "inset : the same quantity for @xmath78 , but with larger resolution in @xmath68 . at this resolution ,",
    "steps in the @xmath79 is plotted in figure  [ d(r)_bz2 ] for @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ d(r)_bz2](a - h ) ) .",
    "the consecutive vanishing of the order parameter in different areas with increasing parallel magnetic field is clearly visible .",
    "it is noticeable that even when the order parameter vanishes , as a result of the field , in one area of the sample , the other regions remain almost unaffected .",
    "the different regions ( for which the order parameter vanishes at different parallel fields ) can thus be indeed regarded as separated scis .     at @xmath81 for @xmath82 ( a - f ) .",
    "arrows indicate regions in which the order parameter vanishes abruptly ( sc islands ) . ]",
    "as already mentioned , another indication for the destruction of the sc order may be elucidated by examining the local magnetization @xmath83 , which develops locally where scis are destroyed by the parallel field .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ magnetization_bw ] , where we plot side by side the spatial distributions of the _ differential variations _ of the magnetization and of the pairing potential , for a finite orbital field and for different zeeman fields ( same values as in fig .",
    "[ d(r)_bz2 ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the magnetization ( dark regions in the left panels ) develops only where scis ( dark regions in the right panels ) shrink .",
    "notice that even when the parallel field strength exceeds the critical value ( @xmath84 for these parameters ) , the magnetization still fluctuates , now due to correlations with the local electron density .",
    "( columns 1 and 3 ) , and in pairing potential amplitude , @xmath85 ( columns 2 and 4 ) , for different zeeman fields @xmath86 , and for orbital field @xmath81 .",
    "the emergence of magnetic correlation occurs simultaneously and is highly correlated with the vanishing of sc order . ]",
    "an important and experimentally testable prediction of the above calculation is that a strongly disordered sc film subject to a parallel field may have both a zero resistance state and finite magnetization .",
    "this is in contrast with a clean film , which is either sc or spin polarized .",
    "in this paper the physics related to formation of scis in disordered two - dimensional sc films and their evolution under an applied magnetic field was addressed .",
    "scis are defined as specific domains exhibiting large value of the order parameter amplitude surrounded by other domains for which the amplitude of the order parameter is small . using the locally self - consistent solution of the bdg equations",
    ", it was demonstrated that scis are formed in disordered sc films . upon an increase of the orbital magnetic field ,",
    "the size of these islands tend to decrease , together with the strength of the order parameter .",
    "this is accompanied by loss of sc phase correlations between different islands .    in order to verify that scis indeed constitute separate isolated domains ,",
    "the application of parallel magnetic fields has been included in our numerical simulations . for a uniform or weakly disordered sample it results in a first order transition into a normal state .",
    "in contrast , for medium and high disordered systems and in the presence of an orbital magnetic field , it is found that upon increasing the parallel magnetic field , the average order parameter vanishes in a series of steps , indicating that each island undergoes a phase transition at its own turn , with its own critical parallel field .",
    "this substantiates the picture of well separated and isolated scis . in ref .",
    "we have demonstrated a one - to - one correspondence between the phase correlations between the islands , at finite orbital field and zero zeeman field , on one hand , and their sequential response to the zeeman magnetic field , on the other hand .",
    "this suggests that the sit can be studied within mean - field theory , even though the latter does not include phase fluctuations .",
    "the above results can in principal be addressed experimentally , by means of local measurements using , e.g. , scanning tunneling microscopy , which is also sensitive to magnetic order .",
    "we predict that , as a function of parallel magnetic field , the ( average ) sc order parameter will exhibit a behavior resembling that of figure  [ d_parallel ] , that is the transition will be smoothed when the orbital effects are dominant .",
    "the local sc gap on an isolated island , on the other hand , should exhibit a sharp attenuation characteristic of a first - order transition .",
    "this will be accompanied by local formation of magnetic order , so we expect local magnetism coexisting with either bulk superconductivity ( if the scis percolate ) or local superconductivity ( if they do not ) .",
    "lastly we point out that some of the phenomena discussed here were also observed in high-@xmath87 superconductors .",
    "local variations in the sc gap have been observed by stm measurements.@xcite in the underdoped region , it was observed @xcite that local sc gap persists well into the normal phase .",
    "even more relevant is the observation @xcite in these materials of inhomogeneous magnetic response , which persists above @xmath87 .",
    "thus disorder may play an important role in high-@xmath87 superconductors , especially in the underdoped regime , leading , for example , to the interpretation of the pseudo - gap , as an average over the spectra of sc and non - sc regions .",
