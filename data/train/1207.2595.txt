    "the quantitative consideration of this question seems important since although there exists a number of approaches to the canonical quantum field theory formalism in the vicinity of extended field @xmath3 , see e.g. , the observables practically were not considered because of the complicated problem with symmetry constraints .",
    "a theory in which the consequences of broken by @xmath1 symmetry is taken into account explicitly will be called as `` the field theory with symmetry '' understanding that @xmath1 is the result , at least , of high space - time symmetry of action @xmath4 .",
    "the main physical result of present paper looks as follows : the transition of interacting field into the mass - shell particles state , and vice versa , is impossible in the field theories with symmetry",

    "a short list of unsolved problem will be given in the last sec.5 .",
    "the conclusion ( ) can be extended directly on the gluon production case in non - abelian gauge theory without matter ( quark ) fields , see also sec.5 .",
    "it will be seen that the used formalism allows to act _",
    "ex adverso_. so , we will introduce @xmath0-matrix using ordinary lsz reduction formalism . the conclusion ( ) is general , it does not depend on the concrete form of theory lagrangian , @xmath10 . for this reason one can have in mind the simplest @xmath6 conformal scalar field theory : l=()^2- ^4 ,  g>0 ,",
    "lagras an example to consider massless scalar particles production , see appendix a where particles production in the theory with lagrangian ( ) is described .",
    "we expect that the interaction of internal states with external particles is switched on adiabatically , i.e. that the external fields can not have an influence to the spectrum of interacting field perturbations in the case of field theory with symmetry .",
    "the builded formalism will correspond to this basic condition .",
    "so , the @xmath11-point green function @xmath12 is defined by a formulae : @xmath13 the lsz reduction formula means that the external legs ( massless particles in the considered case ) must be amputated , i.e. the amplitude is defined by the expression , see also : @xmath14 and the amplitude in the energy - momentum representation looks as follows , see fig.1 : a_mn(q_1, .... q_m ; p_1,p_2, ... ,p_n)=d_k=1^m ( q_k;)_k=1^n ^*(p_k ; ) e^is ( ) , 2.2a1where ( q;)=dx e^-ixq ^2(x ) ,  q^2=0 , 2.2a2is the external particles annihilation vertex .",

    "moreover , the effect of `` symmetry breaking by @xmath60 '' is hidden in this approach , there is no obvious way to find the consequences of symmetry constraints . that is why the another way of computation of integral ( ) was chosen .",
    "having a theory on @xmath15-like measure ( ) one may adopt such most powerful method of classical mechanics as the transformation of variables , see also .",

    "this reduction of degrees of freedom is the main formal problem considered in details in present section , see also .",
    "it must be noted also that the used formalism is lorenz non - covariant .",
    "for this reason we will distinguish space and time components , @xmath69 .",
    "this circumstance is not crucial since we calculate the cross section , @xmath9 , which always is defined in the definite lorenz frame .",
    "we will explain in the appendix b why the general case @xmath70 have not been realized .",
    "so , we will not pay attention during subsequent calculations to the space components , @xmath65 , since they are the insufficient variables .",
    "actually @xmath60 would be the singular distribution function of time because of the quantum perturbations but we will see that the singularities of @xmath60 are integrable and do not gives an influence on the final result ( ) .",
    "the transformation ( ) is generated by a strict solution , @xmath71 , of the lagrange equation ( ) where @xmath72 is the set of integration constants .",
    "the complete set of solutions of nonlinear @xmath6 equations of motion like ( ) is unknown and we are forced to assume that the classical field , @xmath71 , of necessary property ( ) exists .",
    "this is a main lead - in assumption of the approach , the explicit form of @xmath71 will not be important for us .",
    "the set of new fields , @xmath73 , will be defined by the set @xmath72 , i.e. we will describe quantum dynamics mapping the problem with symmetry into the _ factor space _ @xmath74 , @xmath75 the approach goes back to the old idea of statistical systems description in terms of _ collective variables_. may define the space - time position of @xmath76-th maximum , its scale , etc .",
    "in other words the set @xmath72 defines the integral , i.e. the `` collective '' , form of @xmath60 . allowing for the symmetry constraints only the collective variables remain free . ]",
    "the simple explanation of topology side of the transformation ( ) was described in the transparent papers , see also textbook and .",
    "the paper is also useful since clarify hamilton description to the extended , soliton , field configurations , farther details one can find in .",
    "one can note also existence of the suggestion to leave the frame of canonical schemes to quantize the extended fields .",
    "actually our approach to the quantum field theory with symmetry consists from two parts .",
    "first one stands of the mapping into @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the symmetry group of @xmath76 . in the conformal field theory with symmetry if @xmath76 is the @xmath79-invariant solution of eq .",
    "the second one contains dynamics , see also .",
    "the problem of quantization comes into existence only in the second part .",
    "one can call following useful geometrical interpretation of the `` collective variables '' approach .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath72 form the factor space @xmath74 and @xmath71 belongs to it _",
    "completely_. the mapping of dynamics into @xmath74 form in it the finite - dimensional hypersurface .",
    "for example , the hypersurface compactify into the arnold s hypertorus if the classical system is completely integrable , see additional references in and",
    ". then half of parameters @xmath80 are the radii of the hypertorus and other half are the angles .",
    "description of quantum system in terms of the collective - like variables @xmath81 means the description of random deformations of such hypersurface , i.e. of the surface of arnold s hypertorus in the case of completely integrable system .",
    "that is why our approach describes just the fluctuations of @xmath82 at the expense of fluctuations of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , our formalism describes _ the fluctuations of @xmath1 _ , instead of usually considered canonical formalism which describes the fluctuations in _ the vicinity _ of @xmath1 , sec.2.2 .",
    "therefore , the main step of our calculations is the reduction of field - theoretical problem with symmetry to the quantum - mechanical one , where @xmath83 are the generalized coordinates and momenta of the particle which is moving in @xmath74 .",
    "it should be noted that in the frame of to - day knowledge it is impossible to present the complete set of first integrals of motion in involution considering the equations of type ( ) .",
    "nevertheless we incline to interpret the reduction of degrees of freedom ( ) as the consequence of symmetry constraints .",
    "it is evident that being the infrared stable the quantum - mechanical perturbations of @xmath81 unchange the conclusion that @xmath1 is the well localized field , i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "that is why we come to ( ) in all orders over @xmath58 .",
    "the method of transformation ( ) looks as follows .",
    "one can simplify calculations considering the case of @xmath86 since interactions with external fields are switched on adiabatically .",
    "then we have : _",
    "0=_j = e=0e^-i(j , e)dm e^iu(,e ) , 3.35where @xmath37 is the odd functional over @xmath87 and 2(j , e)=_c^+ ddt , 3.36dm=_,t d(,t)(_^2(,t)+v()-j(,t ) ) .",
    "3.37one may shift mills time contour @xmath30 , see ( ) , on the real time axis since the description of fluctuations of @xmath88 in terms of @xmath81 would be free from light - cone singularities .",
    "this slightly simplifies calculations but the analytical continuation on the real time axis should be done carefully if @xmath1 have nontrivial topology , see also .",
    "the distinction of field theory from quantum mechanics consists in the presence of the space degrees of freedom . to look into this problem",
    "let us consider the formalism on the `` smoothed '' @xmath15-function : _",
    "= 0_(x)=(x).delit obeys the property of the ordinary @xmath15-function : @xmath89 at the same time @xmath90 is finite , @xmath91    then , introducing the @xmath92 variable @xmath93 : 1=_,t d(,t ) ( ( , t)-(,t ) ) 3.38we come to the measure : dm=_=0_,t d(,t)d(,t)_((,t)- ) _ ( ( , t)+ ) .",
    "3.39the hamiltonian looks as follows : h_j = d\\{^2(,t)+((,t))^2 + v()-j(,t)(,t)}.hamthe independency of @xmath2 and @xmath94 is not important for us .",
    "introduction of the auxiliary variable @xmath94 is useful since in this case we come to the first order formalism and this will be important .",
    "let us introduce the unit : 1=_i=1^_t d_i(t)d_i(t)_,t _ ( ( , t)-u(;,))_((,t)-p(;,)),3.40where @xmath76 and @xmath95 are given functions of the @xmath96 set of variables @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the normalization factor .",

    "the fact of the matter is that eqs .",
    "( ) singles out definite parametrization of functions @xmath63 and @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , we should think that substitution of @xmath76 and @xmath95 will transform the equalities : @xmath104 into identities .",
    "this possibility is a consequence of the fact that both differential measures in ( ) and ( ) are @xmath15-like .",
    "let us introduce for sake of clearness the lattice in the @xmath65 space with @xmath105 cells . then",

    "notice also that @xmath109 .",
    "this means that the integral ( ) is @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
