    "rare decays of @xmath0 meson , @xmath3",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 , are the most suitable candidates for study of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . since their branching fractions are usually very small within the sm predictions , they can sometimes show up new physics with unexpectedly large values of decay rates .",
    "the decay @xmath4 , which has been already measured by the cleo collaboration @xcite , has shown that there is not much extra parameter space for its branching fraction from new physics @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath6 suffers from severe backgrounds of @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonance contributions in the measurement of branching fraction , and so it may not be easy to uncover new physics cleanly @xcite . however , a number of methods have been discussed to detect new physics through the details of the decay process , such as differential distributions or polarization effects @xcite .",
    "recently a new method utilizing the angular distribution of @xmath9 has been proposed @xcite .",
    "imagine the decay configuration when @xmath10 is emitted to the direction of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is emitted to the opposite direction in the rest frame of @xmath0 meson .",
    "here @xmath12 is off - shell photon and it further decays into @xmath13 , and @xmath10 subsequently decays into @xmath14 .",
    "if we ignore small mixture of the longitudinal component , the angular momentum of @xmath10 is either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , and the corresponding production amplitude is proportional to @xmath17 or @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "suppose the final @xmath19 meson is emitted to the direction of @xmath20 in the rest frame of @xmath10 , where @xmath21 is a polar angle and @xmath22 is an azimuthal angle between the decay plane of ( @xmath14 ) and the decay plane of ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "in the low invariant @xmath23 region , electromagnetic operator terms are dominated and the decay amplitude for the whole process is proportional to @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath0 and @xmath26 are the real functions of the other angles .    in this new method , we can distinguish the new physics contribution from that of the sm even if the branching fraction of the decay is similar to the prediction of the sm : in the @xmath27 decays the probability of @xmath0 meson decaying to left - handed ( or right - handed ) circular polarized @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) , and therefore the polarization measurement of @xmath10 and @xmath30 is useful for extracting the ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "even though the polarization of high energy real photon can not be measured easily , we can still get some useful information through the azimuthal angle distribution in the low invariant mass region of dileptons for @xmath9 decay .",
    "this is because the decay products of @xmath10 and the virtual photon @xmath12 are responsible for this polarization measurements . in the sm ,",
    "the operator @xmath32 is dominant and the operator @xmath33 is suppressed by @xmath34 . in this case , the angular distribution of the decay products is a flat function of the angle @xmath22 in the small lepton invariant mass region .",
    "if there is new physics contribution , the contribution of both operators can be equally important @xcite .",
    "we can distinguish the new physics signal easily from the angular distribution of the decay @xmath35 , while the measured branching fraction for @xmath36 can still be accommodated .    in this paper",
    ", we extend this method to calculate the angular distribution of @xmath37 in generalized supersymmetry models ( gsusys ) .",
    "in addition to the operator @xmath33 , we also consider the new operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the following section ,",
    "we derive the general formula for the various angular distributions including the new operators .",
    "section iii is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussions in gsusys .",
    "we start with the general effective hamiltonian for the corresponding @xmath6 decay @xcite , _ eff(bs ^+^-)&= & - v_tbv_ts^ * _ i=7 ^ 10 ( c_il o_il + c_ir o_ir )  .",
