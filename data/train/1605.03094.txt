    "in this article , we examine the complex interplay between surface states known as tamm states@xcite , plasmonic defect ( pd ) modes , and the pc band structure in tunable thz plasmonic band gap devices engineered from a gaas / algaas 2deg .",
    "the studied pc devices , samples a and b , are pictured in fig .",
    "both are integrated at the vertex of an antenna having bandwidth from 100 ghz to 1 thz .",
    "these plasmonic structures are based upon a four period pc formed below gate g1 with an adjacent independently controlled plasmonic defect ( pd ) @xcite controlled by gate g2 .",
    "a pd is induced when g2 is tuned to a different voltage than g1 .",
    "while these plasmonic band gap structures are nearly 100 times smaller than the free space wavelength of thz radiation , they can not be considered an effective medium because the wavelengths of the thz plasmons tightly confined to the 2deg are comparable to the size of the pc unit cell@xcite .    the adjacent regions of 2deg in this system can be represented as sequential distributed plasmonic ` @xmath7 ' transmission line elements , where @xmath8 is defined in eq .",
    "1 . it is convenient to treat the pc unit cell as illustrated in fig .",
    "1c using this equivalent circuit approach . in fig . 1d",
    "the pc unit cell is indicated by a dashed box in the cross - sectional illustration of sample a. the kinetic inductance @xmath3 and resistance @xmath9 of the equivalent distributed circuit are explicitly defined through the drude conductivity of the 2deg , @xmath10@xcite ( _ supplemental materials , section i _ ) .         and @xmath11 are shown for ( b ) 302.5 , ( d ) 363.0 and ( f ) 420.5 ghz excitation frequencies .",
    "the calculated band gaps ( grey ) of the infinite pc and the pc - pd system modes ( blue ) are plotted for ( c ) 302.5 , ( e ) 363.0 and ( g ) 420.5 ghz . ]",
    "tuning of the gate voltages @xmath12 and @xmath13 controls the 2deg inductance and resistance , @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 defines the normalized 2deg density in terms of the threshold voltage @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 ) and the applied gate voltages @xmath18 such that @xmath19 . in terms of the pc unit cell diagrammed in fig .",
    "1c , the applied gate voltage @xmath20 controls the inductance @xmath21 and resistance @xmath22 .",
    "the ungated region of 2deg has constant distributed inductance @xmath23 and resistance @xmath24 .    in fig .",
    "1e , the electrostatic potential @xmath25 of a plasma wave with a frequency of @xmath26 ghz is illustrated in a four - period pc .",
    "the potential @xmath25 is shown around the plane of the 2deg .",
    "also indicated are the spatially periodic equilibrium 2deg kinetic inductance @xmath3 and density @xmath27 of the four - period pc . here",
    "a 2 @xmath28 m plasmon wavelength below g1 is evident for the 456 ghz excitation with free space wavelength of 658 @xmath28 m , or about @xmath29 .",
    "to develop intuition concerning the tunability of the pc , we first consider the bulk plasmonic band structure of a pc having an infinite number of periods .",
    "the crystal dispersion of the infinite pc , plotted in fig .",
    "2a for several values of @xmath30 , was calculated from the 1d kronig - penney model@xcite for the unit cell shown in fig .",
    "1c , @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the bloch wavevector , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the plasmon wavevector and characteristic impedance , respectively , of the two elements forming the unit cell , and @xmath35 is the length of the @xmath36 section of 2deg ( _ supplemental materials , section ii _ ) . with @xmath30=0.8 ,",
    "minigaps begin to emerge in the 2deg plasmon dispersion relation that is folded into the first brillouin zone . as @xmath30 further decreases ,",
    "full plasmonic bandgaps are evident and the entire band structure shifts downward in frequency .",
    "a four - period pc between s and g2 can be induced in sample a , shown in fig .",
    "1a , by biasing the defect gate g2 past its threshold voltage as illustrated in fig .",
    "the pc formed below g1 delivers a plasmonic signal to a rectifying detection element under g2 , generating a photovoltage @xmath37 as explained in the methods summary . by tuning g1 and frequency as plotted in fig .",
    "2b , the measured photoresponse maps the plasmonic spectrum of sample a. the bright regions correspond to the resonant excitation of plasma modes in the system ( _ supplemental materials , section ii _ ) . for comparison , resonant modes calculated for the four - period pc using a transfer matrix formalism@xcite ( _ supplemental materials , section i _ ) are shown by solid lines .",
    "these eight resonances are associated with the second and third allowed bands , and the five lowest order of these resonances are resolved experimentally .",
    "above 350 ghz and @xmath38 , discrete modes can not be resolved due to the relatively shorter plasmon coherence length in this regime ( _ supplemental materials , section iii _ ) .",
    "each unit cell of the four - period structure would have an identical resonant frequency in isolation .",
    "however , the coherence of the plasma wave across the pc lifts this four - fold degeneracy , resulting in the formation of four state bands .",
    "alternately , this can be considered a fano - type system where interference between a continuum , the allowed bands of the pc , and the discrete modes of the cavity formed between s and g2 produces groups of four asymmetric resonances@xcite .",
    "these bands of states are demonstrated in fig .",
    "2a to tune a minimum of 50% in frequency from 300 ghz to 450 ghz , though in principle the shift of the band gap can be well in excess of 100% .",
    "the first three experimentally observed resonances in fig .",
    "2b moving from the lower right - hand corner ( 300 ghz and @xmath39 ) towards the upper left - hand corner are positioned in an allowed infinite pc band .",
    "these band states are highlighted in blue .",
    "however , the fourth mode associated with this band is largely found in the second band gap of the infinite pc , where it is highlighted in green .",
    "all regions of modes highlighted in green are in the predicted band gaps corresponding to those labeled in fig .",
    "2a , including a pair near @xmath40 and 300 ghz .",
    "these modes could potentially represent plasmonic tamm states@xcite .",
    "tamm states , weakly localized crystal surface states with a complex rather than purely real bloch wavevector ( @xmath41 \\neq 0 $ ] ) , are generally found in a band gap and have been experimentally demonstrated previously only in a few electronic@xcite , photonic@xcite , and hybrid optical - plasmonic@xcite systems .",
    "in contrast to surface states resulting from dislocations and impurities , tamm states form at the ideal termination of a lattice and are most easily isolated in tailorable structures like semiconductor superlattices and photonic crystals . though the results shown in fig .",
    "2 are indicative of tamm state formation , additional direct measurements are needed to justify this hypothesis .",
    "to search for tamm states in this system , sample b , pictured in fig .",
    "1b , was studied with gate g3 biased beyond its threshold voltage . here",
    "the last stripe of depleted 2deg below g3 operates as a rectifying detector as illustrated in fig .",
    "3a ( _ supplemental materials , section ii _ ) .",
    "this configuration of sample b provides a means to study the strong coupling between the four - period pc below g1 and a the pd@xcite defined under g2 .",
    "the photoresponse to excitation frequencies of 302.5 , 363.0 and 420.5 ghz as g1 and g2 are independently tuned is shown in fig .",
    "3b , d , f , respectively . as in fig .",
    "2a , the bright regions represent plasma resonances . in fig .",
    "3c , e , g the calculated pc - pd structure plasmon modes , blue lines , are plotted for these same frequencies as a function of normalized 2deg densities @xmath42 corresponding to the experimentally applied gate voltages .",
    "the band gaps of the infinite pc where the bloch wavevector of experimentally observed resonances has a non - zero imaginary component are indicated in grey .",
    "an understanding of the relationship between the pc and pd states emerges when considering fig .",
    "the four period pc modes are tuned by g1 and appear as vertical features when the pd is not resonating .",
    "pd resonances are modes controlled by g2 and appear as bright horizontal lines where sequential anticrossings occur . when @xmath43 , the pd may be viewed as a fifth identical unit cell that is appended to the four - period pc under g1 .",
    "this condition is satisfied along the diagonal lines in fig .",
    "3b - g where a fifth discrete mode is added to each band by a higher order mode moving into a lower energy band after traversing the infinite pc band gap .    the black boxes in fig .",
    "3b - e highlight repelled crossings between two states in or near the second band gap along the diagonal line @xmath43 .",
    "a repelled crossing is found along this diagonal if and only if a pd and a tamm state of the same order are mutually coupled . because an isolated pd state is localized",
    ", it must enter into a band gap before joining a five - state band as an orthogonal pc mode .",
    "only localized states are found in the infinite pc band gap .",
    "a tamm state bound near the ohmic contact is the only viable candidate to cross with a pd mode along the line @xmath43 .",
    "there are several additional distinctions between crossings of the pd modes with purely real - valued bloch wavevector pc states and with complex bloch wavevector tamm states .",
    "modes in the allowed bands are completely delocalized and therefore are widely separated as they come into resonance with a pd mode . in fig .",
    "3f , g under 420.5 ghz excitation where the band gaps largely vanish , none of the pc states becomes localized and for any fixed choice of @xmath20 ( @xmath30 ) the resonances are widely spaced in @xmath11 ( @xmath44 ) . in contrast , due to the localization of tamm states , both their coupling with the pd and the size of the pd - tamm splitting are comparatively smaller .",
    "this leads to the the close approach of the modes in the black boxed regions of fig .",
    "as the energy of a pd mode approaches that of the tamm state by tuning @xmath45 , an analogy may be drawn to electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit)@xcite provided several conditions are satisfied .",
    "the description of eit in classical systems is that of two coupled oscillators , one of which is ` bright ' and and the other ` dark ' with respect to incident radiation . in this picture , the pd and tamm states then must be coherently coupled and resonate at the same frequency , conditions that are satisfied empirically in this plasmonic system .",
    "more importantly , there must be an asymmetry in both the external coupling and the damping rates of the coupled plasmonic oscillators .",
    "the ` dark ' resonance must be weakly externally coupled and have a higher quality factor than the ` bright ' resonance . in high quality 2deg plasmonic systems , weak coupling to an external excitation implies a higher ` q ' resonance because radiative damping is the dominant dissipation mechanism of the plasmon ( _ supplemental materials , section iii _ ) .",
    "this plasmonic eit - like effect is studied through analysis of the pc - pd modes in and near the first band gap .",
    "while it is common to sweep frequency in order to map the interaction of strongly coupled resonators@xcite , our approach of tuning resonators _ in - situ _ with fixed excitation frequency yields the same information . in fig .",
    "4a the photoresponse of sample b with an excitation frequency of 210.0 ghz is shown . here the characteristic frequency @xmath46 of the pc unit cell is swept for different detunings @xmath47 of the pd relative to pc unit cell .",
    "the characteristic plasma frequencies @xmath48 are defined for the pc unit cell ( @xmath49 ) and pd ( @xmath50 ) using the fundamental wavevector @xmath51 of the plasmon mode confined below an @xmath52 wide gate finger .",
    "in fact , the characteristic frequencies @xmath53 are the fundamental plasma frequencies of the isolated pc unit cell and pd .",
    "the detuning of the pd characteristic frequency from that of the pc unit cell is given by @xmath54 .",
    "these definitions of @xmath53 parameterize the strong coupling behavior of the pc - pd system .    for positive detunings @xmath55 ghz , an asymmetric resonance associated with the pd",
    "is observed at the edge of the band gap ( shaded grey ) in fig .",
    "4a , while the tamm state appears inert due to its poor coupling to both the incident thz field and the integrated detector . here",
    "we interpret the pd as a ` bright ' resonator that under appropriate conditions can couple to and drive the ` dark ' tamm state .",
    "the pd and tamm states become strongly interacting when the detuning is reduced , @xmath56 ghz @xmath57 ghz . as the energetic difference between these states decreases ,",
    "the ` bright ' pd excites the formerly ` dark ' tamm state .",
    "a characteristic signature of eit , a symmetric double peak with a dip at its center , is evident with the detuning set to @xmath58 ghz . for negative detunings @xmath59 ghz , the pd state shifts to larger characteristic frequencies @xmath46 and the tamm state s amplitude decreases . the calculated modes , shown in blue in fig .",
    "4a , agree well with the measurements .",
    "the plasmonic spatial distributions in fig .",
    "4b highlight the evolution of the pd and tamm states .",
    "the distributions of modes m1 and m2 , indicated by the arrows linking to fig .",
    "4a , are plotted for several detunings @xmath60 .",
    "the position corresponds directly to fig .",
    "3a ; the mixer edge is at @xmath61 , the pd is located between @xmath62 , and the pc is found between @xmath63 .",
    "both the ` bright ' pd state , seen distinctly with @xmath64 for m1 and @xmath65 for m2 , and the ` dark ' tamm state , observed with @xmath65 for m1 and @xmath64 for m2 , are weakly localized .",
    "for @xmath66 , the crystal is sufficiently short that the spatial overlap of the two weakly localized states lifts their degeneracy .",
    "pc modes develop around zero detuning that are analogous to bonding and anti - bonding states .",
    "these may also be interpreted as coupled tamm states formed at opposing edges of the pc@xcite .",
    "in this article , we have studied the band structure as well as coupled surface and defect states in tunable pc structures .",
    "the engineering of plasmonic resonators _ in - situ _ rather than solely through lithographic tuning of physical geometry opens a previously unexplored avenue for the study of strongly coupled electromagnetic systems@xcite .",
    "both photonic crystals@xcite and coupled resonators@xcite can be harnessed for slow light applications , and tunable plasmonic systems provide a useful degree of freedom for possible slow light devices .",
    "while the presented plasmonic devices based upon gaas / algaas heterostructures are likely limited in both operating temperature ( @xmath67 77 k ) and operating frequency ( @xmath67 1 thz ) , both gan - based 2degs and graphene@xcite hold promise for extending the viable range of the pc - based structures ( _ supplemental materials , section iv _ ) .",
    "recent studies have shown tunable thz plasmons in gan 2degs at 170 k@xcite and at room temperature in graphene@xcite , as well as mid - infrared plasmons in graphene nanostructures@xcite .",
    "finally , we note that manipulation of the localized pc defect and tamm state field distributions to produce strong field enhancements@xcite in 2deg structures could give rise to a new generation of ultra - sensitive direct and heterodyne thz detectors as well as thz oscillators@xcite .",
    "* methods summary * the devices were fabricated using standard contact lithography , metalization deposition , and lift - off techniques from a gaas / algaas double quantum well heterostructure ( sandia wafer ea1149 ) with total 2deg density 4.02 x 10@xmath68 @xmath69 at 12 k. the 2deg is embedded a distance @xmath70 = 386 nm below the surface of the mbe - grown heterostructure .",
    "the periodic gates were designed to have a 4.0 @xmath28 m period with 50% metalization duty cycle , while fabricated dimension differed slightly yielding a 3.8 @xmath28 m period with approximately 60% metalization duty cycle of the 10 @xmath28 m wide mesa .",
