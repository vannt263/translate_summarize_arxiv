    "one of the main achievements in quantum information theory is the determination of the capacity of memoryless quantum channels by holevo @xcite , and independently by schumacher and westmoreland @xcite , for transmission of classical information .",
    "these results have been considerably sharpened by winter @xcite , who extended wolfowitz s @xcite approach via frequency typical sequences to the quantum setting and obtained coding theorem with strong converse for transmission of classical information over memoryless quantum channel . at the same time",
    "ogawa and nagaoka @xcite proved the strong converse in the memoryless situation by a different proof that follows the classic arimoto s @xcite approach .",
    "subsequently shor @xcite and devetak @xcite have shown by independent proofs that the capacity of the memoryless quantum channel is given by the coherent information . the weak converse to this coding theorem",
    "was already established by barnum , nielsen and schumacher in @xcite .",
    "shor uses the method of random selection of subspaces while devetak chooses an approach via private classical capacity and a transformation of private classical codes into quantum codes .",
    "an interesting point in devetak s approach is that the classical capacity results for quantum channels @xcite are one of the crucial building blocks for the direct part of coding theorem for quantum channels . in spite of this progress one of the main open questions concerning classical capacity of memoryless quantum channels , namely the additivity problem @xcite , is still unresolved .",
    "+ although memoryless quantum channels play a prominent role in the development of the foundations of quantum information theory , real - world channels are rarely memoryless .",
    "thus it is desirable to have a broad and efficient theory for quantum channels with memory . in this paper",
    "we will consider causal ergodic classical - quantum channels satisfying an additional continuity condition , which basically means that the effect of the inputs far in the past decays with respect to the variational distance .",
    "the causality means in this context that the outputs up to time @xmath0 depend only on inputs up to time @xmath0 .",
    "obtained coding results are then applied to a class of causal quantum channels in order to obtain their classical capacity .",
    "the extension to causal ergodic quantum channels with decaying input memory is not obvious at all , since several ergodicity problems arise .",
    "the discussion of these problems is postponed to the future work .      in section [ cq - channels ]",
    "we introduce general classical - quantum channels ( cq - channels for short ) in analogous fashion to the classical setting as a family of conditional states and show how this point of view leads to the usual definition as a completely positive map between the output - algebra and input - algebra .",
    "concepts of stationarity and ergodicity are also introduced and an equivalent condition for ergodicity of a stationary cq - channel is derived .",
    "it states that a stationary cq - channel is ergodic iff it is extreme point in the set of all stationary cq - channels .",
    "several equivalent formulations of this statement are given and it is shown that not all of them can be extended to stationary quantum channels simultaneously .",
    "+ the second part of section [ cq - channels ] is devoted to the notion of _ continuity of cq - channels_. as it was pointed out by mcmillan in his classic paper @xcite the continuity properties of channels are crucial for the validity of coding theorems .",
    "we formulate these continuity notions with respect to the _ variational distance _ on quantum states . a more natural notion of distance would be a metric on quantum states which shares as many properties as possible with the classical @xmath1distance , which is extremely sensitive to the ergodic and mixing properties of channels and probability measures .",
    "see e.g. gray and ornstein @xcite for application to classical channels , and books @xcite by shields resp .",
    "gray for introduction and applications to the ergodic and information theory . to our knowledge",
    ", there is still no metric on the set of quantum states which could play a similar role as the @xmath1distance .",
    "+ section [ cq - channels ] is closed by some examples . + after some preliminary results in section [ preliminary ] we prove the direct coding theorem and weak converse to it in section [ coding - imc ] .",
    "our approach combines the maximal code construction of wolfowitz @xcite , which was already applied by winter @xcite for memoryless cq - channels , with the quantum shannon - mcmillan theorem from @xcite , in order to avoid usage of frequency typical and conditionally frequency typical projections , which are not an adequate tool for correlated quantum states . in a sense , this approach is a mixture of wolfowitz s code construction and the version of feinstein s lemma from blackwell / breiman / thomasian in @xcite which is based on the notion of the joint input - output probability distribution . +",
    "these results are extended to causal cq - channels with decaying input memory in section [ coding - dima ] . since",
    "our notion of continuity is symmetric with respect to past and future it is even possible to prove coding theorem for cq - channels with decaying input memory _ and _ anticipation without any additional complications , although we are only interested in causal situations .",
    "+ finally , the results are applied to obtain coding results for transmission of classical information via weakly output mixing quantum channels in section [ coding - class - quant ] . in order to keep the extent of this paper reasonable , the extension to ergodic quantum channels",
    "is postponed to a forthcoming paper . + for a reader without experience with @xmath2algebras , states and quasi - local algebras we provide an appendix that contains a short description of these concepts complemented by some standard references and some examples .      in @xcite kretschmann and werner considered stationary causal quantum channels , and have shown that each channel of this type can be seen as a concatenation of channels acting on the single - site input algebra and memory algebra with the range in the joint system of the single - site output algebra and memory algebra . in the classical setting",
    "this approach corresponds to the point of view , that the past inputs and outputs can be seen as the states of the channel for the transmission of the actual input letter and the resulting output symbol .",
    "if the duration of the memory of the input and output is finite this class of channels is called _ finite - state channels _ and coding theorems for them were established by blackwell , breiman and thomasian in @xcite under the assumption that the channel is additionally _ indecomposable_. a different account to finite - state indecomposable channels is given in the monograph @xcite by gallager .",
    "+ kretschmann and werner have proved in @xcite a general weak converse to the coding theorem , and for channels with _ finite memory _",
    "they derived the direct part of the coding theorem under the assumption that the channel is _ forgetful _ , which is quantum analogon of the notion of the indecomposability . under these circumstances",
    "the channels under consideration are well approximable by memoryless quantum channels .",
    "+ recently , datta and dorlas @xcite used an approach via a quantum version of feinstein s lemma ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to give another proof of the direct part of the coding theorem for transmission of classical information over a quantum memoryless channel and remarked that this approach can be extended to prove direct coding theorem for classical information transmission via quantum channels with markovian correlated noise ( see section [ examples ] for the definition of this class of channels ) .",
