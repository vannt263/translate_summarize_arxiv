    "the sets of all possible structural graphs and metabolic diagrams were regarded as respective categories with the functorial relations between them .",
    "thus , the chemical reactions and traffic were considered compartmentalized according to the spatial relations between cells . divisions and spatial relations of cells",
    "were regarded as some particular chemical reactions and control influence , respectively . as a result",

    "each plant cell represents a stream of substances , namely the stream of nutrients which allow the cell to divide and to grow .",
    "every dividing cell or a pair of the sister cells represents a stream of cells , since it produces new cells in own cell lineage .",
