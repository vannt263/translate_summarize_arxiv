    "it is now well - established that the kinetic feedback from massive stars creates shell structures in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "indeed , studies of these objects in the magellanic clouds provide the best empirical understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "these types of shells can be roughly classified into three categories ( chu 1996 ; meaburn 1980 ) , which are summarized in table  1 : `` bubbles '' and supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which result from stellar winds and supernovae ( sne ) of individual massive stars ; `` superbubbles , '' which result from the action of a few , to hundreds of , ob star winds and sne clustered in an ob association ; and `` supergiant shells , '' which have sizes of order @xmath0 kpc or more .",
    "if the supergiant shells are analogously created by massive star feedback , they must be associated with starburst phenomena having total wind and sn energies of @xmath1 erg .",
    "this review will focus on recent ( 1990 s ) studies of superbubbles in the magellanic clouds , with also a brief look at supergiant shells .",
    ".ob star shells . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     how do these shells evolve ?",
    "depending on the dominant physics , there are three self - similar relations that are usually used to describe the shell evolution . in the case of a single point energy deposition ,",
    "as would apply to a sn , we have the traditional sedov ( 1959 ) blastwave : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the shell radius , @xmath4 is the input mechanical energy , @xmath5 is a uniform ambient density , and @xmath6 is elapsed time . for a constant mechanical power @xmath7 over an extended period , there is a standard , adiabatic evolution ( pikelner 1968 ) given by , @xmath8 this model has a double - shock structure , in which the inner shock , close to the energy source , heats the wind ejecta to temperatures of order @xmath9 k , driving the shell growth by the thermal pressure behind the outer shock at the shell .",
    "if the hot interior is able to radiate away its energy , the inner shock will collapse upon the outer one , and the shell may assume a momentum - conserving model ( steigman 1975 ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wind terminal velocity .",
    "this model describes a growth rate intermediate between those of equations  [ sedov ] and [ ad ] .",
    "there are other variations of these models ; for example , an extensive review of astrophysical blastwaves is given by ostriker & mckee ( 1988 ) .",
    "assuming coeval star formation in ob associations , the growth of superbubbles quickly becomes dominated by sn activity , although most of those found in  are extremely young objects that are still wind - dominated , @xmath12 myr old .",
    "most empirical , recent studies of superbubbles attempt to test the applicability of the standard , adiabatic model .",
    "the lmc in particular , offers a fine selection of objects , which have been used to evaluate the shell dynamics and search for enclosed hot gas .",
    "recent dynamical studies ( oey & massey 1995 ; oey 1996 ; mac low _ et al . _ 1998 ; oey & smedley 1998 ) of individual lmc superbubbles have found a class of objects whose observed @xmath13 is far too high for self - similar growth , in view of the stellar population present ( @xmath14 is the shell expansion velocity ) .",
    "based on excess observed x - ray luminosities , chu & mac low ( 1990 ) and wang & helfand ( 1991a ) suggest that most of these objects suffered recent snr impacts on the shell walls .",
    "complex velocity structures in several objects ( rosado 1990 ; ambrocio - cruz 1997 ) are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "however , oey & smedley ( 1998 ) and mac low ( 1998 ) demonstrate that blowout from a high - density into a low - density region can perfectly mimic the shell kinematics .",
    "although many optical superbubbles show this high @xmath13 evidence of disruption , it is important to note that other objects have been found whose dynamics are fully consistent with self - similar growth ( oey 1996 ) .",
    "however , all of the objects , along with the high @xmath13 objects , appear to indicate a growth rate discrepancy from the standard model , where the assumed @xmath15 is overestimated by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "it is unclear whether this is caused by an overestimate in stellar wind power , or underestimate in ambient @xmath5 , or both .",
    "the search for hot gas within the superbubbles is an important test of the standard model .",
    "several studies ( chu & mac low 1990 ; wang & helfand 1991a ; magnier 1996 ; mac low 1998 ) have found objects with x - ray emission in excess of predictions .",
    "as mentioned above , these may be caused by snr impacts .",
    "reassuringly , there are other superbubbles that do not show x - ray enhancements ( chu 1995 ) , and detection limits for these remain consistent with the predicted x - ray emission .",
    "furthermore , in all superbubbles that have been examined for c iv and si iv absorption , these high - ionization species have been found ( chu 1994 ) , and can be attributed to an interface layer between the shell wall and hot interior .",
    "supergiant shells ( sgs s ) are more poorly understood than superbubbles .",
    "it is possible that many of these do not originate from star formation events at all .",
    "alternative mechanisms include impacts by high - velocity clouds ( tenorio - tagle 1987 ) and gamma - ray bursters ( efremov 1998 ; loeb & perna 1998 ) . at any rate , the evolution of sgs s is likely to differ substantially from that of superbubbles because the size scales are similar to those of galactic parameters like scale height and length .",
    "the sgs s in the lmc have been catalogued by meaburn ( 1980 ) , and only two of these have been examined in any detail .",
    "the most well - known example is lmc-4 , associated with the constellation iii stellar region .",
    "this region is a remarkably well - defined shell , @xmath16 pc in radius , seen in both  and as a ring of optical  regions .",
    "there have been numerous studies of lmc-4 over the last two decades ; the most recent work is by domgoergen ( 1995 ) and bomans ( 1996 ) studying its gaseous properties , and by olsen ( 1997 ) and braun ( 1997 ) on the stellar content .",
    "the other lmc sgs that has been examined is lmc-2 , just east of 30 dor .",
    "its gas properties were studied by wang & helfand ( 1991b ) and caulet & newell ( 1996 ) .",
    "superbubbles , as a direct manifestation of massive star feedback , are of critical importance to the global properties of the ism . these include ism structure and kinematics , relationship between the different gas phases , and interstellar processes like star formation .    to gain insight on the ism structure and kinematics caused by superbubbles , it is possible to use equation  [ ad ] to derive a size and velocity distribution for superbubbles in the ism .",
    "this also serves as an additional test of the standard , adiabatic evolution over the full lifetimes of the superbubbles .",
    "oey & clarke ( 1997 ) computed the size distribution @xmath17 for the smc , using the  region luminosity function and assuming a constant creation rate for ob associations .",
    "the observed slope @xmath18 for  superbubbles ( staveley - smith 1997 ) is in remarkable agreement with the predicted slope of @xmath19 , suggesting that superbubble activity can fully explain the structure of the smc .",
    "this can be compared to @xmath20 for holes in a fractal ism structure ( elmegreen 1997 ) , which is being quantified for the smc by stanimirovi ( 1998 ) .",
    "they find a volume fractal dimension @xmath21 , translating directly to @xmath22 .",
    "it is therefore too difficult to distinguish between a superbubble and fractal ism model , using only @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , the similarity in observed @xmath23 for both cases in the smc , might be indicative of a physical relation between the two structural models .",
    "it is also possible to test for superbubble structure in the ism by examining the morphology of the  holes , of which @xmath24 were catalogued as shells , based on elliptical shape ( staveley - smith 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the velocity distribution @xmath25 computed by oey & clarke ( 1998 ) is also consistent with the observed shell velocities for the smc .",
    "a superbubble velocity structure could be a dominant input to the kinematics and turbulence of the ism .",
    "as superbubbles expand and age , their surface brightness quickly diminishes .",
    "hence , they could be an important component of the diffuse , warm , ionized medium ( wim ) . hunter ( 1994 )",
    "obtained emission - line spectra of superbubbles in the lmc , which do show that some of the line ratios are intermediate between those for classical  regions and wim detected in other galaxies .",
    "kennicutt ( 1995 ) examined the morphological structure of the wim in the magellanic clouds , and also found a substantial contribution from faint superbubbles and sgs s .",
    "finally , it is widely thought that superbubbles can trigger renewed star formation in their shells of swept - up cool gas .",
    "several candidates have been examined in the lmc .",
    "the clearest example is dem  34 / n11 ( walborn & parker 1992 ; rosado 1996 ) , and additional candidates are dem  152 / n44 ( oey & massey 1995 ) and dem  192 / n51  d ( oey & smedley 1998 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the sgs lmc-4 has a long history of investigation as a triggered star formation candidate ( efremov 1998 ) .",
