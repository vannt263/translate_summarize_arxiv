    "the studies of the complete genomes of many organisms came up with the determinations of the nontrivial statistical characteristics , such as the long - range correlations , the short - range correlations and the fractal features or genomic signatures .",

    "was established to analyze the correlation structures of nucleotide strings@xcite .",
    "the transference of nucleotide strings appears at many positions of a complete genome and makes a regular and irregular correlation structures , but the periodic correlation structures in the complete genome are the most interesting in view of the dynamics . in this paper , using the metric representation and the recurrence plot method , we identify periodic correlation structures in bacterial and archaeal complete genomes and analyze the mechanism of the periodic correlation structures .",
    "since the nucleotide strings include transposable elements , the mechanism is conducible to understanding the genome structures in terms of nucleotide strings transferring in the genomes and exploring relations between transference of nucleotide strings and the transposable elements .",
    "in what follows , we give a brief presentation of the metric representation and the recurrence plot method , which are detailed in @xcite . for a given symbolic sequence @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) ,",

    "at the end of 1999 , complete genomes including more of 20 bacteria were in the genbank@xcite . by using the string composition and the metric representation method , the suppressions of all short strings in 23 bacterial and archaeal complete genomes were determined@xcite . in this section , using the metric representation and the recurrence plot method , we determine all long periodic nucleotide strings ( @xmath47 bases ) in the 23 bacterial and archaeal genomes . for the 23 genomes , only 13 have long periodic nucleotide strings .",
