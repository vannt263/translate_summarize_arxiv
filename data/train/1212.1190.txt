    "the im - srg(2 ) energies for @xmath108 , and @xmath85 also lie below their @xmath102-ccsd(t ) counterparts .",
    "there are different mechanisms which might explain this observation : the im - srg(2 ) might contain diagrams beyond @xmath102-ccsd(t ) that lead to an overestimation of the binding energy , or im - srg(2 ) might lack diagrams compared to @xmath102-ccsd(t ) that cancel other contributions .",
    "a detailed diagrammatic analysis of the im - srg which should clarify this issue is in progress , and will be a subject of a forthcoming publication @xcite",
    ".    it might be tempting to consider the differences between im - srg and cc energies for @xmath1 and the exact ncsm result for the bare @xmath2 hamiltonian as a measure of uncertainty for the different many - body methods , because it only depends on @xmath82 and the many - body truncation .",
    "we emphasize that this is not possible , because the quality of the many - body truncation manifestly depends on the resolution scale @xmath79 , as discussed in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : methods3n ] above .",
    "while the uncertainty due to the use of truncated methods like im - srg and cc is reduced for soft interactions , the omission of induced @xmath111 interactions from the free - space srg evolution , the omission of the normal - ordered @xmath3 interaction , and the @xmath75 cut in the present work all introduce additional uncertainties , which are hard to disentangle ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "let us focus on the @xmath59-induced hamiltonian first .",
    "the it - ncsm ground - state energies for @xmath1 and @xmath108 shown in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : methods3n ] exhibit almost no @xmath79-dependence in the range from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , which indicates that omitted induced @xmath111 interactions are irrelevant for these light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the no2b approximation , i.e. , the omission of the normal - ordered @xmath3 term in the initial hamiltonian ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] ) , causes an overestimation of the ccsd binding energy by 2% in @xmath1 , and 1% in the other nuclei studied here @xcite .",
    "this overestimation is independent of @xmath79 .",
    "if we assume that this remains true for im - srg(2 ) and @xmath102-ccsd(t ) as well , the variation of the im - srg and cc energies with @xmath79 must be caused by a combination of the many - body truncation and the @xmath75 cut . both of these effects become weaker as @xmath79 decreases : the energy gain from including additional many - body terms",
    "is reduced as the convergence of the many - body expansion is improved , and the artificial energy gain that is caused by the omission of repulsive @xmath3 matrix elements beyond the @xmath75 cut is reduced as well .    in @xmath1 , the deviation between the im - srg(2 ) and it - ncsm ranges from 2.5% at @xmath114 to 1% at @xmath115 .",
    "the effect of the @xmath75 cut is negligible here , causing changes in the energy in the single-@xmath50 range .",
    "thus , the deviation is dominated by the 2% contribution of the no2b approximation , which amounts to an overestimation of the exact ncsm energy by about @xmath116 .",
    "if we take this into account by shifting the im - srg and cc results upward , the im - srg(2 ) energies lie within a band of @xmath117 around the ncsm result , which leads us to estimate the uncertainty associated with the truncation to be on the order of 11.5% .",
    "size - extensivity of the im - srg(2 ) implies that the relative truncation error , defined as the deviation from the exact ncsm result , should be of similar size in heavier nuclei . adding the uncertainties associated with the no2b approximation and the @xmath75 cut , which are both about 1% ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : ham_implement ] ) , the total estimated uncertainty for @xmath108 and @xmath85 is about 3.5% . for @xmath108 , this estimate agrees very well with the largest deviation between it - ncsm and im - srg(2 ) , which is 3.6% .",
    "we emphasize , however , that these estimates rely on the assumption that the effect of the no2b approximation is the same for im - srg(2 ) and @xmath102-ccsd(t ) as for ccsd .    for the @xmath59-full hamiltonian ( right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : methods3n ] ) , we face the additional complication that the it - ncsm energies for @xmath1 and @xmath108 are themselves @xmath79-dependent , which indicates that induced @xmath118 interactions are no longer irrelevant .",
    "the underestimation of the experimental @xmath1 binding energy in the it - ncsm calculations with the @xmath59-full hamiltonian is caused by the omitted induced @xmath64 interaction ( the fit of the low - energy constants was performed with the bare @xmath3 interaction ) . since the @xmath2 part of the hamiltonian is unchanged from the @xmath59-induced case , we can conclude that @xmath118 interactions must be generated by the srg evolution of the initial @xmath3 interaction @xcite .    in @xmath1 and @xmath108 , the relative differences between the it - ncsm results and the im - srg and cc energies are reduced in comparison to the @xmath59-induced calculation , to about 1.5% and 3% , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the im - srg(2 ) energies now exhibit a weaker @xmath79-dependence than in the @xmath59-induced calculations .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath102-ccsd(t ) results ( also see @xcite ) and can be explained by the influence of the @xmath75 truncation and the omitted induced @xmath118 interactions in the case of the @xmath59-full hamiltonian . in @xmath1 ,",
    "the omitted induced interactions are attractive and their effect on the it - ncsm energies grows only weakly as @xmath79 decreases . for @xmath108 , on the other hand , the reduction of the it - ncsm ground - state energy with decreasing @xmath79 indicates that the net effect of the omitted interactions is repulsive .",
    "as mentioned above , for im - srg and cc we are also omitting parts of the the repulsive @xmath3 interaction by introducing the @xmath75 cut .",
    "the @xmath79-dependence of the two effects is reverse : with decreasing @xmath79 , the effect of omitted @xmath118 interactions increases , but the contribution of matrix elements beyond the @xmath75 cut decreases .",
    "this leads to an apparent reduction of the @xmath79-dependence compared to the @xmath59-induced calculations .",
    "im - srg(2 ) ground - state energy per nucleon of closed - shell nuclei for @xmath59-induced ( top ) and @xmath59-full hamiltonians ( bottom ) at different resolution scales @xmath79 .",
    "energies are determined at optimal @xmath83 for @xmath104 .",
    "experimental energies ( black bars ) are taken from @xcite . ]",
    "we conclude the discussion of our results by giving an overview of our im - srg(2 ) ground - state energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ; the corresponding numbers are listed in table [ tab : res3n ] . with the @xmath59-full hamiltonian",
    ", we obtain a good agreement with experimental binding energies in the @xmath14- and @xmath63-shell nuclei , while those of the @xmath119- and @xmath74-shell nuclei are overestimated by @xmath120 per nucleon , keeping in mind the previously discussed uncertainties of 3 - 4% . a striking feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] is the improvement of the isotopic trends of the ground - state energies with the inclusion of the initial @xmath3 force , in particular for the calcium isotopes .",
    "since the effect of a @xmath79-variation on the ground - state energies is mostly uniform , this improvement appears to be a robust feature .    for the @xmath59-full hamiltonian",
    ", we also find that the aforementioned cancellation which reduces the @xmath79-dependence of the energies ( cf .",
    "[ fig : methods3n ] ) extends to all nuclei studied in this work .",
    "this stability over a wide mass range is quite contrary to the growing @xmath79-dependence with @xmath4 which is obtained without the initial @xmath3 hamiltonian",
    ". it will be interesting to see if these systematics extend to higher masses , but an extension of our calculations beyond the @xmath74-shell will require significant developments in the practical handling of the @xmath3 matrix elements .",
