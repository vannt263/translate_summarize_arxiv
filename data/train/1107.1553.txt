    "the determination of the qcd phase diagram , in particular the location of the critical point , is an important , long standing problem , requiring non - perturbative methods . in lattice qcd",
    ", several approaches have been developed to investigate the phase transition from the hadronic matter to the quark gluon plasma , but all of them are limited to @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the baryon chemical potential .",
    "the reason for this is the notorious sign problem , which arises because the fermion determinant for finite @xmath6 becomes complex , and importance sampling is no longer applicable . in qcd ,",
    "the sign problem is severe , since the relative fluctuations of the complex phase factor grow exponentially with the lattice volume . in the strong coupling limit of lattice qcd ( sc - qcd ) discussed below",
    ", the sign problem is however mild and the full @xmath7 phase diagram can be obtained .",
    "in sc - qcd , the gauge coupling is sent to infinity and hence the coefficient of the plaquette term @xmath8 is sent to zero .",
    "hence the yang mills part @xmath9 is absent .",
    "then , the gauge fields in the covariant derivative can be integrated out analytically . however , as a consequence of the strong coupling limit , the lattice spacing becomes very large , and no continuum limit can be performed .",
    "the degrees of freedom in sc - qcd live on a crystal .",
    "we consider the sc - limit for staggered fermions as studied in @xcite , which after gauge link integration and grassman integration of staggered fermion fields yields a partition function that describes a system of confined , colorless , discrete degrees of freedom :    * mesonic degrees of freedom @xmath10 ( non - oriented meson hoppings called dimers ) and @xmath11 ( mesonic sites called monomers ) , which obey the grassmann constraint @xmath12 at every lattice site @xmath13 ; * baryonic degrees of freedom , which form oriented baryon loops .",
    "these loops are self - avoiding and do not touch the mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the weights for temporal meson or baryon hoppings contain the anisotropy parameter @xmath14 , needed in order to vary the temperature @xmath15 continuously ( see below ) . here",
    ", we will restrict to the chiral limit , @xmath16 . in that case",
    "monomers are absent .",
    "continuous time ( ct ) algorithms are now widely used in quantum monte carlo ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but to our knowledge have not yet been applied to quantum field theories . the continuum limit in euclidean time which we are interested in",
    "is the limit @xmath17 as @xmath18 represents the temperature @xmath19 .",
    "designing an algorithm that operates in this limit will have several advantages : there is no need to perform the continuum extrapolation @xmath20 , which allows to estimate critical temperatures more precisely , with a faster algorithm .",
    "moreover , ambiguities arising from the functional dependence of observables on the anisotropy parameter ( esp",
    ". non - monotonic behaviour as in fig .",
    "[ u3 ] left ) will be circumvented .",
    "also in the baryonic part of the partition function great simplifications occur : baryons become static in the ct - limit , hence the sign problem is completely absent .",
    "the partition function can be written in terms of vertices at which spatial meson hoppings occur : @xmath21 this relation becomes exact in the ct - limit since spatial dimers with multiplicity 2 or 3 are suppressed by powers of @xmath14 and are hence absent at @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ absorptionemission ] right : as the temporal lattice spacing @xmath23 , multiple spatial dimers become resolved into single dimers . the overall number of spatial dimers remains finite in the ct - limit , as the sum over @xmath24 sites compensates the @xmath25 suppression .",
    "temporal dimers can be arranged in chains of alternating 3-dimers and 0-dimers , which we denote by dashed lines , and 2-dimers and 1-dimers , which we denote by solid lines ( see fig .",
    "[ absorptionemission ] ) .",
    "the crucial observation is that the weight of these chains in the partition function is independent of their length , as the weight of each 3-dimer cancels that of the 0-dimer and likewise the weight of 2-dimers cancels that of 1-dimers .",
    "hence , the weight of a configuration will only depend on the kind and number of vertices at which spatial hoppings are attached to solid / dashed lines , not on their position . for sc - qcd ,",
    "there are two kinds of vertices , `` l''-vertices of weight @xmath26 , where dashed and solid lines join , and `` t''-vertices of weight @xmath27 , where a solid line emits a spatial dimer .",
    "the exponents @xmath28 and @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ parf ] ) denote the number of t - vertices and l - vertices at spatial position @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast to meson hoppings , spatial baryon hoppings are suppressed in the ct - limit by factors @xmath31 .",
    "hence , baryons are static in continuous time .",
    "positive ( negative ) oriented baryons are ( dis)favored by a factor @xmath32 over meson lines .",
    "the sign problem has completely vanished !    an important key step towards the ct algorithm is that spatial dimers are distributed uniformly in time as seen in eq .",
    "( [ parf ] ) .",
    "the lengths of dashed or solid intervals ( which are related to the number of l- and t - vertices ) are , according to a poisson process , exponentially distributed : @xmath33\\ ] ] with @xmath34 the `` decay constant '' for spatial dimer emissions . due to the presence of baryons",
    "@xmath34 is space - time dependent : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of mesonic neighbors at a given coordinate .",
    "non - trivial meson correlations arise from the entropy of the various configurations .",
    "likewise , baryonic interactions are due to the modification they induce on the meson bath , and thus also arise from entropy .",
    "the ct algorithm is a worm - type algorithm , similar to the directed path algorithm introduced for sc - qcd in @xcite .",
    "the updating rules are outlined in fig .",
    "[ absorptionemission ] and will be explained in detail in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in sc - qcd at low temperatures , chiral symmetry , i.  e.  the @xmath37 symmetry of the one - flavor staggered action , is spontaneously broken according to @xmath38 , and becomes restored at some critical temperature @xmath39 .     at @xmath40 in the purely mesonic system u(3 ) , exhibiting typical non - monotonic behavior in @xmath41 .",
    "note that the spatial suppression of double and/or triple spatial dimers has no effect on the ct - limit .",

    "we were able to locate the tricritical point and also find a re - entrance already predicted by mean field analysis , due to the fact that the entropy decreases in the high - density phase as the lattice becomes saturated with baryons .",
