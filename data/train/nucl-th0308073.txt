    "high energy meson electroproduction off complex nuclei offers a promising tool to study the physics of hadron formation .",
    "the relatively clean nuclear environment of electron induced reactions makes it possible to investigate the timescale of the hadronization process as well as the properties of hadrons immediately after their creation .",
    "in addition one can vary the energy and virtuality of the exchanged photon to examine the phenomenon of color transparency @xcite .    in previous works @xcite",
    "we have developed a method to combine the quantum mechanical coherence in the entrance channel of photonuclear reactions with a full coupled channel treatment of the final state interactions ( fsi ) in the framework of a semi - classical transport model .",
    "this allows us to include a much broader class of final state interactions than usual glauber theory .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that side feeding effects that are absent in calculation based on glauber theory might play an important role in semi - inclusive photoproduction experiments . in @xcite",
    "we have then investigated the transparency ratio of exclusive incoherent @xmath0 electroproduction off @xmath1n and @xmath3kr within our model and found excellent agreement with the nitrogen data  @xcite from the hermes collaboration .",
    "the most important elementary process for this reaction was found to be diffractive @xmath0 production on bound nucleons .",
    "other production mechanisms were supressed by the stringent exclusivity measure imposed by experiment .",
    "we found no signature for color transparency in the data for the transparency ratio @xmath4 as a function of the @xmath0 coherence length , meaning that in our model calculations we could assume that the diffractively produced @xmath0 starts to interact with a hadronic cross section right after its production .",
    "however , kopeliovich et al . @xcite have pointed out that the missing signal of color transparency might be an accidental consequence of the specific correlation between the @xmath5 of the photon and the coherence length of the @xmath0 in the hermes data .",
    "a finite formation time of hadrons becomes visible in our investigation @xcite of the hermes data on charged particle multiplicities in deep inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) off nuclei @xcite .",
    "in the dis regime we assume that the primary production mechanism is governed by the excitation and decay of a hadronic string .",
    "the fragmentation of the string and the hadronization of the fragments takes some time ( formation time @xmath6 ) .",
    "after their formation time the reaction products undergo hadronic final state interactions with nucleons in the target nucleus . due to time dilatation the formation time @xmath7 in the target rest frame",
    "can become quite large : @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the hadron mass and @xmath10 is the fraction of the photon energy @xmath11 that is carried away by the hadron . for high energies and for very light fragments , e.g. pions , the formation length can easily exceed the size of a nucleus .",
    "this , however , is not the case for the heavier fragments such as baryons and vector mesons for which the formation length at hermes energies is still of the order of the nuclear radius so that `` classical '' nuclear interactions must play a role for these particles . in our model",
    "the prehadronic interactions of the constituent quarks from the string ends during the formation time are effectively accounted for by using the concept of leading hadrons which is in accordance with other transport models for high energy reactions such as the urqmd @xcite and the hsd model @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations for the observed modification of the multiplicity spectra in terms of a possible rescaling of the fragmentation function in nuclei @xcite or a purely partonic energy loss @xcite through multiple scattering of the struck quark and induced gluon bremsstrahlung may model these prehadronic interactions , but may neglect the classical fsi after formation .",
    "the formation time also plays an important role in studies of ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions .",
    "for example , the observed quenching of high transverse momentum hadrons in @xmath12 reactions relative to @xmath13 collisions is often thought to be due to jet quenching in a quark gluon plasma",
    ". however , the attenuation of high @xmath14 hadrons might also be due to hadronic rescattering processes @xcite if the hadron formation time @xmath6 ( in its rest frame ) is sufficiently short .",
    "our paper is structured in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ subsec : shadowing ] we show how we describe the electron - nucleon interaction and how we account for shadowing within our model .",
    "the transport model is sketched in sec .",

    "[ subsec : coherence ] in comparison with experimental data from the hermes experiment . in sec .",

    "we close with a short summary in sec . [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "in our approach the lepton - nucleus interaction is splitted into two parts : 1 ) in the first step the virtual photon is absorbed on a bound nucleon of the target ; this interaction produces a bunch of particles that in step 2 ) are propagated within the transport model .",
    "coherence length effects in the entrance channel , that give rise to nuclear shadowing , are taken into account as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the event generator pythia  v6.2  @xcite to describe the interaction of the virtual photon and a nucleon .",
    "the basic idea is that in a photon hadron collision the physical photon @xmath15 not necessarily interacts as a point particle @xmath16 ( direct interaction ) but might fluctuate into a vector meson @xmath17 ( vector meson dominance , vmd ) or perturbatively branch into a @xmath18 pair before the interaction ( generalized vector meson dominance , gvmd ) .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the latter is very unlikely in the kinematic regime of the hermes experiment ( photon energy @xmath19  gev , @xmath20  gev@xmath21 ) . in most cases",
    "the photon will therefore interact directly with a parton of the target nucleon ( dis ) or fluctuate into a vector meson ( vmd ) before it reaches the nucleon . in the latter case",
    "the vector meson might either scatter diffractively from the nucleon or a hard scattering between the constituents of the vector meson and the nucleon might take place .",
    "the hard scattering like the direct photon nucleon interaction leads to the excitation of one or more hadronic strings which finally fragment into hadrons .",
    "if the struck nucleon is embedded in a nucleus one has to account for its fermi motion and binding energy as well as for pauli blocking of final state nucleons .",
    "in addition one has to be aware that the nuclear environment influences the vmd part of the photon nucleon interaction , since the vector meson components get modified on their way through the nuclear medium to the interaction point .",
    "the latter has been investigated in detail in ref .",
    "there we have shown that at position @xmath22 inside the nucleus the physical photon state has changed to @xmath23 due to these initial state interactions of the photon .",
    "the formfactor @xmath24 from ref .",
    "@xcite accounts also for contributions of longitudinal photons .",
    "if one neglects any influence of the fsi for the moment the reaction amplitude for the process @xmath25 on a nucleon at position @xmath22 inside a nucleus changes compared to the vacuum in the following way : @xmath26 the nuclear profile function @xmath27 can be expressed as @xmath28   \\label{eq : av_profile}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the nucleon number density @xmath29 , the total vector meson nucleon cross section @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath31 of real to imaginary part of the vector meson nucleon forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the bessel function parametrization with @xmath32  gev avoids unphysical contributions from processes where @xmath33 which would contribute for small values of the coherence length @xmath34 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that this bessel function parameterization yields a good description of shadowing in photoabsorption down to the onset region of shadowing .    the probability that the photon interacts with a bound nucleon via a certain vector meson fluctuation therefore depends on the position inside the nucleus .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath35 in the phase factor of eq .",
    "[ eq : av_profile ] equals the inverse of the coherence length @xmath34 of a vector meson component @xmath36 , i.e. the length that the photon travels as a vector meson fluctuation estimated via the uncertainty principle .",
    "the propagation of the produced final state @xmath37 through the nucleus is treated within a semi - classical transport model based on the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) equation .",
    "the buu equation describes the time evolution of the phase space density @xmath38 of particles of type @xmath39 that can interact via binary reactions . besides the nucleons these particles involve baryonic resonances and mesons ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ... ) that are produced either in the primary reaction or during the fsi . for a particle species",
    "@xmath39 the buu equation can be written as : @xmath44.\\ ] ] for baryons the hamilton function @xmath45 includes a mean field potential which depends on the particle position and momentum . the collision integral on the right hand side accounts for the creation and annihilation of particles of type @xmath39 in a collision as well as elastic scattering from one position in phase space into another . for fermions pauli blocking",
    "is taken into account in @xmath46 via blocking factors .",
    "the buu equations of each particle species @xmath39 are coupled via the mean field and the collision integral .",
    "the resulting system of coupled differential - integral equations is solved via a test particle ansatz for the phase space density .",
    "we also stress that within our model instable particles might decay during their propagation through the nucleus . for details of the transport model",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the classes of fsi that are included in the transport model go far beyond what can be achieved within glauber theory . as a result",
    "the finally observed particles do not need to be created in the primary reaction but might be produced during the fsi via side feeding .",
    "it is therefore clear that a purely absorptive treatment of the fsi as in glauber theory can only be used if one is sure that one has eliminated the possibility of side feeding by applying enough constraints on the observable ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "this might be possible for exclusive @xmath0 production measured at hermes but becomes questionable for the measurement of inclusive hadron multiplicity spectra .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : shadowing ] a hard primary photon nucleon interaction leads to the excitation of hadronic strings .",
    "the time , that is needed for the fragmentation of the strings and for the hadronization of the fragments , we denote as formation time @xmath6 in line with the convention in transport models . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the formation time is a constant @xmath6 in the rest frame of each hadron and that it does not depend on the particle species . in principle , one expects a distribution in the formation times , however , we here address only the mean value of such an unknown distribution .",
    "we recall , that due to time dilatation the formation time @xmath7 in the laboratory frame is then proportional to the particle s energy as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : formation - time ] ) .",
    "the size of @xmath6 can be estimated by the time that the constituents of the hadrons need to travel a distance of a typical hadronic radius ( 0.50.8  fm ) .",
    "we assume that hadrons , whose constituent quarks and antiquarks are created from the vacuum in the string fragmentation , do not interact with the surrounding nuclear medium within their formation time . for the leading hadrons , i.e. those involving quarks ( antiquarks ) from the struck nucleon or the hadronic components of the photon , we assume a reduced effective cross section @xmath47 during the formation time @xmath6 and the full hadronic cross section @xmath48 @xcite later on .",
    "this concept is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] : due to time dilatation light particles emerging from the middle of the string might escape the nucleus without further interaction if they carry a large fraction @xmath10 of the photon energy @xmath11 ( 7  gev @xmath49  gev ) .",
    "however , the hadrons with @xmath10 close to 1 ( or energy @xmath50 ) predominantly stem from the string ends and therefore can interact directly after the photon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we note , that about @xmath51 of the intermediate @xmath10 hadrons ( mainly pions ) are created from the decay of vector mesons that have been created in the string fragmentation . because of their higher mass @xmath9 ( 0.77  1.02  gev ) these vector mesons may form ( or hadronize ) inside the nucleus ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : formation - time ] ) ) and thus suffer from fsi .",
    "the effect of the final - state interactions , finally , will depend dominantly on the nuclear geometry , i.e. the size of the target nucleus .     excites a hadronic string by hitting a quark @xmath52 inside a bound nucleon . in our example",
    "the string between the struck quark @xmath52 and diquark @xmath53 fragments due to the creation of two quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "one of the antiquarks combines with the struck quark to form a leading meson @xmath54 , one of the created quarks combines with the diquark to form a leading baryon @xmath55 .",
    "the remaining partons combine to a meson @xmath56 that , depending on the mass of the meson , might leave the nucleus before it hadronizes ( see ( [ eq : formation - time])).,width=302 ]",
    "incoherent @xmath0 electroproduction off nuclei has been studied in ref .  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will summarize the results of our investigations . for our model calculations we demand that the final state has to consist of two oppositely charged pions plus an ensemble of bound nucleons and we use the kinematic cuts of the hermes collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this means that we apply the exclusivity measure @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the nucleon mass and @xmath59 the 4-momentum of the undetected final state . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : py ] ) @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the 4-momenta of the incoming photon and the detected @xmath62 pair and @xmath63 is the 4-momentum of the struck nucleon which , for the calculation of @xmath64 , is assumed to be at rest .",
    "in addition we introduce a lower boundary for the four - momentum transfer @xmath650.09  gev@xmath21 as imposed by the hermes collaboration to get rid of coherently produced @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we show the transparency ratio @xmath66 for exclusive @xmath0 production as a function of the coherence length @xmath67 .",

    "( [ eq : falter ] ) we use for the total @xmath69 cross section @xmath70  mb and for the elastic part @xmath71 mb .",
    "these two values correspond to the @xmath72 cross sections used within the transport model for the involved @xmath0 momenta .     for @xmath0 electroproduction plotted versus the coherence length of the @xmath0 component of the photon .",
    "the data is taken from  @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents the glauber result when using eq .",
    "( [ eq : falter ] ) . for each transparency ratio calculated within our transport model ( open squares ) we used the average value of @xmath5 and @xmath11 of the corresponding data point .",
    "the experimental exclusivity measure ( [ eq : exclusivity ] ) has been taken into account for both nuclei.,width=226 ]    the result of the transport model is represented by the open squares .",
    "for each data point we have made a separate calculation with the corresponding values of @xmath11 and @xmath5 . in the case of @xmath1n",
    "the glauber and the transport calculation are in perfect agreement with each other and the experimental data .",
    "this demonstrates that , as we have discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , glauber theory can be used for the fsi if the right kinematic constraints are applied .",
    "after applying all of the above cuts , nearly all of the detected @xmath0 stem from diffractive @xmath0 production for which the formation time is zero .",
    "the @xmath1n data seems to support the assumption that the time needed to put the preformed @xmath0 fluctuation on its mass shell and let the wave function evolve to that of a physical @xmath0 is small for the considered values of @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the photon energy is too low to yield a large enough @xmath15 factor to make the formation length exceed the internucleon distance and make color transparency visible .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with that reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now turn to @xmath3kr where we expect a stronger effect of the fsi .",
    "unfortunately there is yet no data available to compare with . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the transport calculation for @xmath3kr gives a slightly smaller transparency ratio than the glauber calculation , especially at low values of the coherence length , i.e. small momenta of the produced @xmath0 .",
    "there are two reasons for this : about 10%  of the difference arises from the fact that within the transport model the @xmath0 is allowed to decay into two pions . the probability that at least one of the pions interacts on its way out of the nucleus is about twice as large as that of the @xmath0 .",
    "the other reason is that in the glauber calculation ( [ eq : falter ] ) only the inelastic part of the @xmath69 cross section enters whereas the transport calculation contains the elastic part as well .",
    "thus all elastic scattering events out of the experimentally imposed @xmath73-window are neglected in the glauber description .",
    "it is because of this @xmath73-window that also elastic @xmath69 scattering reduces the transport transparency ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "both effects are more enhanced at lower energies and become negligible for the much smaller @xmath1n nucleus .",
    "as mentioned above hadron production in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering ( dis ) offers a way to study the physics of hadronization  @xcite .",
    "the reaction of the exchanged virtual photon ( energy @xmath11 , virtuality @xmath5 ) with a bound nucleon leads to the production of several hadrons .",
    "depending on the space - time evolution of the production process the rescattering in the surrounding nuclear medium will change the energy distribution and the multiplicity of the produced particles .",
    "consequently , the particle spectrum of a lepton - nucleus interaction will differ from that of a reaction on a free nucleon . in order to explore such attenuation effects",
    "the hermes collaboration has investigated the energy @xmath11 and fractional energy @xmath74 dependence of the charged hadron multiplicity ratio @xmath75 in dis off n  @xcite and kr  @xcite nuclei . here",
    "@xmath76 represents the number of semi - inclusive hadrons in a given ( @xmath77)-bin and @xmath78 the number of inclusive dis leptons in the same @xmath11-bin .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , that a phenomenological description of the @xmath2 data can be achieved if the formation time , i.e. the time that elapses from the moment when the photon strikes the nucleon until the reaction products have evolved to physical hadrons , is assumed to be proportional to @xmath79 in the target rest frame .",
    "this @xmath79 dependence of the formation time @xmath6 is compatible with the gluon - bremsstrahlung model of ref . @xcite . in the investigations of ref .",
    "@xcite any interaction of the reaction products with the remaining nucleus during this formation time has been neglected . after the formation time",
    "the hadrons could get absorbed according to their full hadronic cross section .",
    "another interpretation of the observed @xmath2 spectra  as being due to a combined effect of a rescaling of the quark fragmentation function in nuclei due to partial deconfinement as well as the absorption of the produced hadrons  has recently been given by the authors of ref .",
    "furthermore , calculations based on a pqcd parton model @xcite explain the attenuation observed in the multiplicity ratio solely by partonic multiple scattering and induced gluon radiation .",
    "it has already been pointed out by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite that a shortcoming of the existing models is the purely absorptive treatment of the final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "we avoid this problem by using the coupled - channel transport model .    in our calculation",
    "we employ the kinematic cuts of the hermes experiment as well as the geometrical cuts of the detector . in actual numbers : we require for the bjorken scaling variable @xmath80 ( with @xmath58 denoting the nucleon mass ) , for the photon virtuality @xmath81  gev@xmath21 and for the energy fraction of the virtual photon @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , the pythia model introduces a lower cut in the invariant mass of the photon - nucleon system at @xmath83  gev that is above the experimental constraint @xmath84  gev .",
    "this limits our calculations to minimal photon energies of @xmath85  gev as compared to @xmath86  gev in the hermes experiment and leads to a suppression of high @xmath5 events at energies below @xmath87  gev .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that our model simulation reproduces the experimental average values of the kinematic variables @xmath5 and @xmath11 ( @xmath10 ) on _ n _ and _ kr _ as a function of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) very well . since the particles with @xmath10 close to 1 are predominantly leading hadrons we could use the high @xmath10 part in the fractional energy spectrum to fix the leading hadron cross section .",
    "a good agreement with the data is achieved for @xmath88 during the formation time @xmath6 .",
    "we note , that this value for @xmath47 represents an average value over time from the virtual photon - nucleon interaction to the actual hadron formation time .",
    "since for light nuclei only a fraction of the leading hadrons is formed inside the nucleus , the effective leading hadron cross section @xmath47 is expected to be smaller accordingly . for a detailed investigation",
    "we refer the reader to a forthcoming study  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we show the influence of different formation times @xmath6 on @xmath2 using the effective cross section @xmath88 .",
    "we find , that formation times @xmath89 fm / c are needed to describe the experimental data with little sensitivity to higher values .",
    "this is compatible to the range of values extracted from the antiproton attenuation studies in ref .",
    "@xcite .     and",
    "different values of the formation time @xmath6 .",
    "the data for the nitrogen target have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite while the preliminary _ kr _ data stem from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=321 ]    some of our model assumptions , e.g. the local density approximation , become questionable for very light nuclei .",
    "we have , therefore , used the _ kr _ data to fix the value of the formation time .",
    "however , we also get a satisfying agreement with the nitrogen data .    the pqcd model of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts a hadron attenuation @xmath90 since the parton energy loss is proportional to the propagation length squared .",
    "it is thus important to get the scaling with target mass @xmath91 from our present approach in order to allow experimental studies to distinguish between the different concepts . to this aim",
    "fig  [ fig : fig3 ] also shows predictions for a xe target . in accordance with the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite we predict only a small change in the multiplicity spectra compared to the _ kr _ target such that the scaling exponent is lower than @xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we show the results for the calculated multiplicity ratio of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for _ kr _ in comparison with the experimental data . in our calculations",
    "we use again the kinematic cuts of the hermes experiment with the additional restrictions @xmath98 , @xmath99=2.515 gev and @xmath100=415 gev that are experimentally necessary for particle identification @xcite .",
    "we use a constant formation time of 0.5 fm / c and @xmath88 for all hadrons . without further fine tuning we get a satisfying description of all the data meaning that the formation times of mesons , baryons and antibaryons are about equal .    , @xmath92 , @xmath95 , @xmath94 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for krypton using a fixed leading hadron cross section @xmath88 and formation time @xmath101  fm / c . the experimental data has been taken from ref .",
    "we have developed a method to account for coherence length effects within a semi - classical buu transport model .",
    "this allows us to describe incoherent meson photo- and electroproduction off nuclei at gev energies using a full coupled channel treatment of the fsi .",
    "we have calculated the transparency ratio for exclusive incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction off @xmath1n and @xmath3kr .",
    "the result for @xmath1n is in agreement with experimental data and with the glauber prediction .",
    "the latter shows that in the case of @xmath1n glauber theory is applicable after the kinematic cuts of the hermes experiment are applied .",
    "since we do not use a formation time for diffractively produced vector mesons we deduce that one can not see an onset of color transparency in the nitrogen data . for the @xmath3kr target",
    "no experimental data is available to compare with .",
    "however , we find deviations from the simple glauber model because of the finite life time of the @xmath0 and elastic scattering out of the kinematically allowed @xmath102-region . as discussed by kopeliovich et al .",
    "@xcite one might see an onset of color transparency when investigating the transparency ratio as a function of @xmath5 for fixed coherence length .",
    "in addition we have shown that one can describe the experimental data of the hermes collaboration for hadron attenuation on nuclei without invoking any changes in the fragmentation function due to gluon radiation . in our dynamical studies , that include the most relevant fsi , we employ only the free fragmentation function on a nucleon and attribute the hadron attenuation to the deceleration of the produced hadrons due to fsi in the surrounding medium .",
