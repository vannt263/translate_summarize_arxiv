    "the codes are constructed as illustrated in subsection [ illustration ] . to enhance the performance of our code for the @xmath215 system",
    ", we have multiplied the weight matrices of @xmath103 ( as defined in subsection [ illustration ] ) with the scalar @xmath218 .",
    "this is done primarily to enhance the coding gain , which was observed to be the highest when the scalar @xmath218 was chosen .",
    "it is to be noted that this action does not alter the ml - decoding complexity and the column orthogonality of the generator matrix ( so , the resultant weight matrices still satisfy the tracelessness criterion ) .",
    "consequently , the weight matrices of the silver code for the @xmath215 system can be viewed to be from @xmath219 . for the @xmath216 mimo system ,",
    "the weight matrices of the silver code are from the set @xmath220 , while the weight matrices of the silver code for the @xmath221 system are from the set @xmath222 .",
    "[ fig_cap ] shows the plot of the maximum mutual information achievable with our codes and the punctured perfect codes @xcite for @xmath18 and @xmath216 systems . in both the cases , our codes allow higher mutual information than the punctured perfect code , as was expected .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the plots of the symbol error rate ( ser ) as a function of the snr at each receive antenna for five codes - the djabba code @xcite , the punctured perfect code for 4 transmit antennas , the silver code for the @xmath215 system , the east code @xcite and oggier s code from crossed product algebra with a provable nvd property @xcite . since the number of degrees of freedom of the channel is only 2 , we use the perfect code with 2 of its 4 layers punctured .",
    "our code and the east code have the best performance .",
    "it is to be noted that the curves for the silver code for the @xmath215 system and the east code coincide . also , the silver code for the @xmath215 system is the same as the one presented in @xcite , but has been designed using a new , systematic method .",
    "the silver code for the @xmath215 system and the east code have an ml - decoding complexity of the order of @xmath15 for square qam constellation , while the djabba and oggier s code have an ml - decoding complexity of order @xmath223 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "2 .   @xmath216 mimo + fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the plots of the ser as a function of the snr at each receive antenna for two codes - the punctured perfect code ( puncturing one of its 4 layers ) and the silver code for the @xmath216 system .",
    "the silver code for the @xmath216 system has a marginally better performance than the punctured perfect code in the low to medium snr range .",
    "it has an ml - decoding complexity of the order of @xmath224 while that of the punctured perfect code is @xmath225 ( this reduction from @xmath226 to @xmath225 is due to the fact that the real and the imaginary parts of the last symbol can be evaluated by quantization , once the remaining symbols have been fixed ) .",
    "@xmath227 mimo + fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the plots of the ser as a function of the snr at each receive antenna for the silver code for the @xmath227 system and the perfect code .",
    "the silver code for the @xmath227 system nearly matches the perfect code in performance at low and medium snr .",
    "more importantly , it has lower ml - decoding complexity of the order of @xmath228 , while that of the perfect code is @xmath229 .      to construct the silver code for the @xmath230 system ,",
    "we first construct a rate-1 , 4-group decodable stbc as described in section [ sec4 ] and denote the set of obtained weight matrices by @xmath102 .",
    "next we multiply the weight matrices of @xmath102 by @xmath231 to obtain a new set of weight matrices which is denoted by @xmath103 .",
    "the weight matrices of the silver code for the @xmath230 system are obtained from @xmath232 .",
    "the silver code for the @xmath233 system can be obtained by multiplying the matrices of @xmath102 with @xmath234 and appending the resulting weight matrices to the set @xmath232 .",
    "the rival code is the punctured perfect code for 8 transmit antennas @xcite .",
    "the maximum mutual information plots of the two codes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cap1 ] . as expected , our code has higher mutual information , although lower than the ergodic capacity of the corresponding mimo channels .",
    "[ fig82 ] shows the symbol error performance of the silver code for @xmath230 system and the punctured perfect code @xcite .",
    "the constellation employed is 4-qam .",
    "again , to enhance performance by way of increasing the coding gain , we have multiplied the weight matrices of @xmath103 with the scalar @xmath235 , as done for the codes for 4 transmit antennas .",
    "the simulation plot suggests that our code has full diversity .",
    "the most important aspect of our code is that it has an ml - decoding complexity of @xmath236 , while that of the comparable punctured perfect code is @xmath229 .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a scheme to obtain full - rate stbcs for @xmath10 transmit antennas and any number of receive antennas with the lowest ml - decoding complexity and the least self - interference among known codes .",
    "the stbcs thus obtained allow higher mutual information than existing stbcs for the case @xmath9 . identifying explicit constellations which can be mathematically proven to guarantee full - diversity and a non - vanishing determinant without increasing",
    "the ml - decoding complexity is an open problem .",
    "also , one can seek to obtain full - rate stbcs with reduced ml - decoding complexity for arbitrary number of transmit ( not a power of 2 ) and receive antennas .",
    "these are some of the directions for future research .",
