    "this paper extends the results of @xcite to perturbations of arbitrary rank , and it also extends the free probabilistic interpretation of outlier phenomena in terms of subordination functions as described in @xcite for deformations of wigner models .",
    "indeed , the occurence and role of biane s subordination functions @xcite in the analysis of the interaction spikes / outliers is quite natural . we clarify this in the additive case through the following heuristics , leaving the precise statements to section [ sec : notation - and - statements ] .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be two free selfadjoint random variables in a tracial w*-probability space .",

( this formula is a particular case of biane s result .",

    "the subordination function continues analytically via schwarz reflection through the complement in @xmath74 of the spectrum of @xmath75 .",

    "thus , the analytic function @xmath79 will not be prevented _ a priori _ from taking the value @xmath78 .    however , if relation were true with @xmath65 and @xmath66 replaced by @xmath17 and @xmath80 , respectively , and with the _ same _ subordination function @xmath73 , then any number @xmath81 in the domain of analyticity of @xmath73 so that @xmath82 must generate a polar singularity for the right - hand side of .",
    "therefore , each such @xmath81 must generate a similar singularity for the term on the left - hand side of the same equality , thus necessarily producing an eigenvalue of @xmath83 . while this scenario is not true , we prove that an approximate version does hold .",
    "namely , we show that a compression of the matrix @xmath84^{-1}+a_n\\ ] ] to a subspace @xmath85 is close to @xmath86 , almost surely as @xmath77 .",
    "this insight is crucial in our arguments .",
    "it follows from our results that a remarkable new phenomenon occurs : a single spike of @xmath0 can generate asymptotically a finite , possibly arbitrarily large , set of outliers for @xmath8 .",
    "this arises from the fact that the restriction to the real line of some subordination functions may be many - to - one , that is , with the above notation , the set @xmath87 may have cardinality strictly greater than 1 , unlike the subordination function related to free convolution with a semicircular distribution that was used in @xcite .",
    "the case of multiplicative perturbations is based on similar ideas , with the subordination function @xmath73 replaced by its multiplicative counterparts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 3.5 and 3.6 ) .",
    "in addition to outliers , we investigate the corresponding eigenspaces of @xmath62 .",
    "it turns out that the angle between these eigenvectors and the eigenvectors associated to the original spikes is determined by biane s subordination function , this time via its derivative .",
