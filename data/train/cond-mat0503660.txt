    "nonequilibrium transitions from stuck to flowing phases underlie the physics of a wide range of physical phenomena . in a first class of systems",
    "the onset of a stuck or frozen state occurs as a result of intrinsic dynamical constraints , due to interactions or crowding , and is usually referred to as _ jamming _ @xcite .",
    "familiar examples are supercooled liquids that become a glasses upon lowering the temperature , colloidal suspensions that undergo a glass transition due to crowding upon increasing the density or the pressure , foams and granular materials that jam under shear , arrays of dislocations in solids that jam under an applied load . in a second class of systems",
    "the transition to a stuck state is due to external constraints , such as the coupling to quenched disorder ( pinning centers from material defects in vortex lattices , optical traps in colloids , etc . ) , and is denoted as _ pinning _ @xcite .",
    "both classes of systems can be driven in and out of glassy states by tuning not only temperature , density or disorder strength , but also an applied external force .",
    "the external drive may be a shear stress in conventional glasses or simply a uniform applied force in systems with extrinsic quenched disorder , where even a uniform translation of the system relative to the fixed impurities represents a nontrivial perturbation .",
    "vortex lattices in superconductors @xcite and charge density waves ( cdws ) in metals @xcite can be driven in and out of stuck glassy states by a uniform external current or electric field , respectively . as recognized recently in the context of jamming ,",
    "the external drive plays a role not unlike that of temperature in driving the system to explore metastable configurations and should be included as an axis in a complete phase diagram .    in this lectures i will focus on zero - temperature depinning transitions of interacting condensed matter systems that spontaneously order in periodic structures and are driven over quenched disorder .",
    "the prototype examples are vortex lattices in type - ii superconductors @xcite and charge density waves in anisotropic metals @xcite .",
    "other examples include wigner crystals of two dimensional electrons in a magnetic field moving under an applied voltage @xcite , lattices of magnetic bubbles moving under an applied magnetic field gradient @xcite , and many others .",
    "in general these systems form a lattice inside a solid matrix , provided by the superconducting or conducting material and are subject to pinning by random impurities .",
    "the statics of such disordered lattices have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "one crucial feature that distinguishes the problem from that of disordered interfaces is that the pinning force experienced by the periodic structure is itself periodic , although with random amplitude and phase . as a result , although disorder always destroys true long - range translational order and yields glassy phases with many metastable states and diverging energy barriers between these states , the precise nature of the glassy state depends crucially on disorder strength . at weak disorder the system , although glassy , retains topological order ( the resulting phase has been named bragg glass in the context of vortex lattices ) .",
    "topological defects proliferate only above some characteristic disorder strength , where a topologically disordered glass is formed .",
    "the driven dynamics of disordered periodic structures have been studied extensively by modeling the system as an overdamped elastic medium that can be deformed by disorder , but is not allowed to tear , that is by neglecting the possible formation of topological defects due to the competition of elasticity , disorder and drive .",
    "this model , first studied in the context of charge density waves , exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition from a pinned to a _",
    "unique _ sliding state at a critical value @xmath0 of the driving force .",
    "this nonequilibrium transition displays universal critical behavior as in equilibrium _ continuous _ transitions , with the medium s mean velocity @xmath1 acting as an order parameter @xcite . while the overdamped elastic medium model may seem adequate to describe the dynamics of driven bragg glasses , many experiments and simulations of driven systems have shown clearly that topological defects proliferate in the driven medium even for moderate disorder strengths @xcite .",
    "the dynamics near depinning becomes spatially and temporally inhomogeneous , with coexisting moving and pinned degrees of freedom .",
    "this regime has been referred to as plastic flow and may be associated with memory effects and even hysteresis in the macroscopic response .",
    "the goal of the present lectures is to describe coarse - grained models of driven extended systems that can lead to history - dependent dynamics .",
    "such models can be grouped in two classes . in the first class",
    "the displacement of the driven medium from some undeformed reference configuration remains single - valued , as appropriate for systems without topological defects , but the interactions are modified to incorporate non - elastic restoring forces @xcite .",
    "in the second class of models topological defects are explicitly allowed by removing the constraint of single - valued displacements . here",
    "we will focus on the first class and specifically consider driven periodic media with a linear stress - strain relation , where the stress transfer between displacements of different parts of the medium is nonmonotonic in time and describes viscous - type slip of neighboring degrees of freedom .",
    "a general model of this type that encompasses many of the models discussed in the literature was proposed recently by us @xcite . here slips between neighboring degrees of freedom",
    "are described as viscous force , that allows a moving portion of the medium to overshoot a static configuration before relaxing back to it .",
    "it is shown below that such viscous coupling can be considered an effective way of incorporating the presence of topological defects in the driven medium .",
    "related models have also been used to incorporate the effect of inertia or elastic stress overshoot in crack propagation in solids @xcite .",
    "the precise connection between the two classes of models has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : singleparticle ] we review the simplest example of depinning transition , obtained when non - interacting particles are driven through a periodic pinning potential . by contrasting the case of periodic and non - periodic pinning",
    ", we stress that care must be used in the definition of the mean velocity of the system . in section [ sec : extendedmedium ] , we first describe the generic coarse - grained model of a driven elastic medium that exhibits a _ continuous _",
    "depinning transition as a function of the driving force from a static to a _",
    "unique _ sliding state .",
    "next we introduce an anisotropic visco - elastic model as a generic model of a periodic system driven through strong disorder .",
    "the model considers coarse - grained degrees of freedom that can slip relative to each other in the directions transverse to the mean motion , due to the presence of small scale defects ( phase slips , dislocations , grain boundaries ) at their boundaries , but remain elastically coupled in the longitudinal directions .",
    "the slip interactions are modeled as viscous couplings and a detailed physical motivation for this choice is given in section [ subsec : viscous_couplings ] .",
    "most of our current results for these type of models are for the mean - field limit and are presented in section [ sec : mean_field ] .",
    "the studies carried out so far for finite - range interactions suggest that the mean - field theory described here may give the correct topology for the phase diagram , although there will of course be corrections to the critical behavior in finite dimensions @xcite .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : other_models ] by discussing the relation to other models described in the literature and the connection to experiments .",
    "it is instructive to begin with the problem of a single particle driven through a _ periodic _ pinning potential as the simplest illustration of driven depinning . assuming overdamped dynamics , the equation of motion for the position @xmath2 of the particle is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a friction coefficient ( in the following we choose our units of time so that @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is the external drive and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 an integer , is a periodic function of period @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    "we choose a piecewise linear pinning force , corresponding to @xmath10 , for @xmath11 . in this case a periodic solution of eq .",
    "( [ single_per ] ) is obtained immediately in terms of the time @xmath12 needed to traverse a potential well , or period . introducing an arbitrary time @xmath13 such that if @xmath14 , then @xmath15 , the particle position for @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath12 is given by @xmath18 for @xmath19 and diverges for @xmath20 .",
    "in other words if @xmath20 the particle never leaves the initial well , i.e. , it is pinned .",
    "the threshold force for depinning is then @xmath21 . in the sliding state the mean",
    "velocity is defined as the average of the instantaneous velocity @xmath22 over the arbitrary initial time @xmath13 .",
    "this gives @xmath23 this definition naturally identifies the mean velocity of the particle with the inverse of the period .",
    "the logarithmic behavior of @xmath24 near threshold , @xmath25 , is peculiar to a discontinuous pinning force . for an arbitrary pinning force",
    "@xmath26 the period @xmath12 is @xmath27 and can be evaluated analytically for various forces .",
    "for instance , for a sinusoidal pinning force , @xmath28 , one finds @xmath29 , which gives @xmath30 near threshold , a generic behavior for continuous pinning forces",
    ".    the main focus of the remainder of this paper will be on the modeling of extended driven systems as collections of interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "it will then be important to distinguish two cases . for extended systems that are periodic , such as charge density waves and vortex lattices , the pinning potential is itself periodic as each degrees of freedom sees the same disorder after advancing one lattice constant . for non - periodic systems , such as interfaces ,",
    "each degree of freedom moves through a random array of defects .",
    "when interactions are neglected , an extended _ periodic _ system moving through a periodic random pinning potential can be modeled as a collection of @xmath31 non - interacting particles , where each particle sees its own periodic pinning potential .",
    "the pinning potentials seen by different particles may differ in height and be randomly shifted relative to each other , as sketched in fig .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath32-th particle at position @xmath33 is then @xmath34 where @xmath35 are random phases uniformly distributed in @xmath36 and the pinning strengths @xmath37 are drawn independently from a distribution @xmath38 .",
    "since the displacements @xmath33 are decoupled , they can be indexed by their disorder parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 instead of their spatial label @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath41 . the mean velocity of the many - particle system can then be written as an average over the random phases and pinning strengths , @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the average over the random phase of each degree of freedom is equivalent to the average over the random time shift @xmath13 described for the single - particle case and yields @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the period of each particle given in eq .",

    "this is a discretized one - dimensional realization of the elastic medium model described by eq .",
    "( [ elastic_model ] ) below . ]",
    "a different single - particle problem that has been discussed in the literature is that of a particle moving through a _",
    "random ( non - periodic ) _ array of defects @xcite .",
    "the defects can be described as pinning potential wells centered at random positions and/or with random well heights . to make contact with the periodic case we consider a particle moving through a succession of evenly spaced pinning potential wells of random heights .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total number of pinning centers and the pinning strengths @xmath53 are drawn independently from a distribution @xmath54 .",

    "the mean velocity of the particle is defined as the total distance travelled divided by the total time and is given by @xmath57 in this case , unless the distribution @xmath48 is bounded from above , there is always a finite probability that the particle will encounter a sufficiently deep potential well to get pinned .",
    "therefore for unbounded @xmath48 the particle is always pinned in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if @xmath48 is bounded from above by a maximum pinning strength @xmath58 , this value also represents the depinning threshold .",

    "although it is always difficult to establish conclusively on the basis of numerics that hysteresis survives in the limit of infinite systems , the size of the hysteresis loop evaluated numerically does appear to saturate to a finite value at large system sizes , indicating that the mf approximation may indeed capture the correct finite - dimensional physics .",
    "other models of driven systems with inertial - type couplings have been proposed in the literature .",
    "it is useful to discuss in some detail their relationship to the viscoelastic model considered here .    in the context of charge density waves , littlewood @xcite and levy and collaborators",
    "@xcite modified the fukuyama - lee - rice model @xcite that describes the phase of the cdw electrons as an overdamped elastic manifold driven through quenched disorder by incorporating the coupling of the cdw electrons to normal carriers .",
    "this was realized via a global coupling in the equation of motion for the phase to the mean velocity of the cdw , not unlike what obtained by a mean - field approximation of our viscous coupling .",
    "the model was argued to account for the switching and non - switching behavior observed in experiments .",
    "schwarz and fisher @xcite recently considered a model of crack propagation in heterogeneous solids that incorporates stress overshoot , that is the fact that a moving segment of the crack can sometimes overshoot one or more potential static configurations before settling in a new one , inducing motion of neighboring segments .",
    "these effects may arise from elastic waves that can carry stress from one region to another of the driven medium .",
    "stress overshoots , just like topological defects in a driven disordered lattice , have an effect similar to that of local inertia and were modeled by fisher and schwarz by adding couplings to gradients in the local crack velocity in the equation of motion for a driven elastic crack .",
    "these authors considered an automaton model where time is discrete .",
    "it is straightforward to define an automaton version of our ve model , where both the displacement @xmath215 and time are discrete , as shown in ref .",
    "it is then apparent that the automaton version of the viscoeleastic model given in ref .",
    "@xcite is identical in its dynamics to the model of crack propagation with stress overshoot studied by schwarz and fisher , provided the strength @xmath200 of the stress overshoot is identified with the combination @xmath216 .",
    "the two models differ in the type of pinning considered as the random force used in by schwarz and fisher is not periodic .",
    "we find , however , that the two models have identical mean - field behavior , with a mean - field tricritical point separating continuous from hysteretic dynamical transitions .",
    "the connection between the viscoelastic and the stress - overshoot model is important because it stresses that distinct physical mechanisms ( inertia , nonlocal stress propagation , unbound topological defects ) at play in different physical systems can be described generically by a coarse - grained model that includes a coupling to local velocities of the driven manifold .",
    "finally , in a very recent paper , maimon and schwarz suggested that out of equilibrium a new type of generic hysteresis is possible even when the phase transition remains continuous @xcite .",
    "driven models with both elastic and dissipative velocity couplings may therefore belong to a novel universality class that exhibits features of both first and second order equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "they clearly deserve further study .",
    "we now turn briefly to simulations and experiments . for comparison with experiments",
    "it is useful to point out that the tricritical point of the viscoelastic model can also be obtained by tuning the applied force and the disorder strength , rather than the applied force and the viscosity .",
    "since the phase diagram does not depend on the form of the disorder distribution , @xmath48 , we choose for convenience a sharp distribution , @xmath217 .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath218 plane is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : vephased_f_vs_h ] . for weak disorder",
    "the depinning is continuous , while for strong disorder it becomes hysteretic , with a region of coexistence of pinned and moving degrees of freedom .",
    "the _ tricritical point _ is at @xmath219 , with @xmath220 .",

    "are the discontinuous hysteretic jumps of the velocity obtained when @xmath6 is ramped up and down adiabatically . ]",
    "simulations of two - dimensional driven vortex lattices clearly show a crossover as a function of disorder strength from an elastic regime to a regime where the dynamics near depinning is spatially inhomogeneous and plastic , with coexistence of pinned and moving degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in fact a bimodal distribution of local velocity was identified in ref .",
    "@xcite as the signature of plastic depinning .",
    "this local plasticity does not , however , lead to hysteresis in the macroscopic dc response in two dimension : the mean velocity remains continuous and single - valued , although it acquires a characteristic concave - up ward form near depinning that can not be described by the exponent @xmath225 predicted by elastic models in all dimensions .",
    "hysteresis is , however , observed in simulations of three - dimensional layered vortex arrays where the couplings across layers are weaker than the in - layer ones @xcite . in this case",
    "the phase diagram is qualitatively similar to that obtained for the viscoelastic model .",
    "recent experiments in @xmath226 have argued that memory effects originally attributed in this system to `` plasticity of the driven vortex lattice @xciteare actually due edge contamination effects @xcite . in the experiments",
    "a metastable disordered vortex phase is injected in a stable ordered bulk vortex lattice .",
    "memory effects may then arise in the macroscopic dynamics during the annealing of the injected disordered phase .",
    "edge contamination does not , however , explain the plasticity seen in simulations , where periodic boundary conditions are used @xcite",
    ". a possible scenario may be that while in the experiments the vortex lattice in the bulk is always in the ordered phase , in the simulations the vortex lattice in the bulk of the sample may be strongly disordered even in the absence of drive .",
    "such a disordered vortex lattice would then naturally respond plastically to an external drive .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning one experimental situation where hysteresis of the type obtained in our model is indeed observed in the macroscopic response .",
    "this occurs in the context of charge density waves , driven by both a dc and an ac field . in this case",
    "the dc response exhibits mode - locking steps .",
    "the ' ' depinning \" from such mode - locked steps was found to be hysteretic @xcite .",
    "several colleagues and students have contributed to various aspects of this work : alan middleton , bety rodriguez - milla , karl saunders , and jen schwarz .",

    "the work was supported by the national science foundation via grants dmr-0305407 and dmr-0219292 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqmotion ] ) should include a convective derivative that arises from the transformation to the laboratory frame @xcite .",
    "this is negligible near a continuous depinning transition where the mean velocity is very small and it drops out in the mean field limit considered here .",
    "it will therefore be neglected , although it does play a crucial role on the dynamics well into the sliding state @xcite ."
