    "if the inner accretion flow is dominated by strong gravity then many important aspects of the underlying accretion physics are expected to be scale invariant ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the black hole accretion process should be entirely described by the mass and spin , but their observational appearance will also be determined by the mass accretion rate , geometry , and other system parameters .    several bhbs display high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) at @xmath6hz ( e.g. @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) . these are the fastest coherent features observed in bhbs , with frequencies close to the keplerian frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . with an origin in the strongly - curved spacetime close to the black hole",
    ", hfqpos should therefore carry information about the two fundamental parameters of black holes : mass and spin .",
    "a scale invariance of the accretion process implies that hfqpos should also be present in agn .",
    "the first robust agn hfqpo detection came from the seyfert galaxy re j1034 + 396 , with a @xmath7hr periodicity ( * ? ? ? * hereafter g08 ) .",
    "later , a @xmath8s qpo was reported during a tidal disruption event in swift j164449.3 + 573451 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , a @xmath9hr qpo was confirmed in 2xmm j123103.2 + 110648 ( @xcite ) , which the authors associated with the low - frequency qpo phenomenon due to the low black hole mass ( @xmath10 ) and 50 per cent rms variability .",
    "a systematic study of agn power spectra was presented in @xcite , where no significant qpos were detected , except the known qpo in re j1034 + 396 .",
    "the qpo at @xmath0hz in re j1034 + 396  was originally detected in the 0.310.0kev band from a @xmath1ks _ xmm - newton  _ observation by g08 and @xcite .",
    "this feature was confirmed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter v10 ) , although the detection was claimed to be less significant .",
    "the 0.310.0kev psd of four further observations of re j1034 + 396  was studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m11 ) , where no evidence for a periodic feature was seen . however , m11 found tentative evidence for the presence of a qpo in two low flux / spectrally - harder observations , through analysis of the covariance spectra ( @xcite ) , suggesting the qpo is a transient feature .",
    "further attempts at understanding the qpo in re j1034 + 396  have limited themselves to the one @xmath1ks observation ( @xcite ; m10 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hfqpos are observed in certain bhb ` states ' ( very high / intermediate ) , associated with high mass accretion rates ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". the high mass accretion rate of re j1034 + 396  ( @xmath11 ) led ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m10 ) and m11 to conclude that the re j1034 + 396  is an analogue of the 67hz qpo in the super - eddington bhb grs 1915 + 105 ( and possibly the same feature is being seen in the black hole candidate igr j170913624 @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we show that the qpo feature is present in all of the low flux / spectrally - harder observations , numbering five in total .",
    "the energy dependence of the qpo has changed over the 4 year period between the observations , yet the qpo frequency remains unchanged at @xmath0hz .",
    "the structure of this letter is as follows : in section  [ sec : obs ] we describe the observations and data reduction , in section  [ sec : psd ] we present the power spectral analysis and qpo identification , and in section  [ sec : disco ] we discuss the results in terms of current qpo mechanisms and the analogies with bhb hfqpos .",
    "we make use of the 8 publicly available _ xmm - newton  _ observations of re j1034 + 396 .",
    "for the psd analysis we are most concerned with long observations ( i.e. with durations > 25ks ) , however we do include the short @xmath12ks observation taken in 2002 .",
    "the details of these observations are shown in table  [ obs_tab ] .",
    "we focus only on the epic - pn ( european photon imaging camera ; @xcite ) data",
    ". the observation data files ( odfs ) were processed following standard procedures using the _ xmm - newton  _  science analysis system ( sas v13.5.0 ) , with filtering conditions pattern = 04 and flag = 0 .",
    "source light curves were extracted in a 20 arcsec circular region and the background was taken from a large rectangular region on the same chip .",
    "we filtered out soft proton flares using a threshold of @xmath13 in the 10.012.0kev background light curve .",
    "we linearly interpolate across any short gaps and add poisson noise .",
    "the interpolation fraction was typically @xmath14 per cent .",
    "the background was visually inspected for rises towards the end of the observations , and we clipped the end of the observations if the background rate became approximately equal to the source rate .",
    "the duration of the clipped light curves that are used in the subsequent analysis are given in table  [ obs_tab ] column 4 .",
    "the 2002 observation ( hereafter obs0 ) and the first long observation ( hereafter obs1 ) were taken in full - window ( fw ) mode , and as such suffers from pile - up ( m11 ) .",
    "for these observations only we use a 40 arcsec extraction region and excise the central 7.5 arcsec for consistency with g08 and m11 . the remaining observations ( hereafter obs2obs7 )",
    "were taken in small - window ( sw ) mode , and do not suffer the effects of pile - up ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the 0.30.8kev ( soft ) and 1.04.0kev ( hard ) light curves",

    "the hard band was chosen to maximise the contribution of the power - law spectral component ( e.g. m11 ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "a typical value of @xmath36 is found from long - term x - ray monitoring studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , however we test @xmath37 as significances of qpo features are strongly dependent on the continuum modelling ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when fitting for model 1 we take model 2 as @xmath19 for the lrt . when fitting for models 2 and 3 we used model 1 as @xmath19 , despite now having non - nested models in the lrt",
