    "the ubiquity of the gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) in physics and statistics is a consequence of the central limit theorem ( clt )  @xcite , which states that the pdf of the sum of @xmath0 independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "stochastic variables whose variance is finite converges to the gaussian pdf when @xmath1 .",
    "if the hypothesis of finite variance is relaxed , a generalized clt still exists  @xcite : the pdf of the sum belongs to the family of _ lvy _ stable distributions , defined by the characteristic function ( fourier - transform ) @xmath2\\ ] ] with @xmath3 . for @xmath4 the gaussian distribution",
    "is recovered , while for @xmath5 the pdf possesses power - law tails @xmath6 which make the variance infinite . in this article , only symmetrically distributed stochastic variables are considered , for which @xmath7 .    a _ lvy flight _",
    "@xcite ( lf ) is a random walk in which the step length is chosen from the pdf of eq .",
    "since lvy distributions are stable under convolution , the lf process is self - similar , i.e. the same lvy distribution describes increments over different time scales , provided the increments are appropriately rescaled .",
    "lvy flights appear in various physical problems  @xcite , in particular diffusion , fluid dynamics , and polymers .",
    "however , because of their infinite variance and lack of a characteristic scale , lvy pdfs overestimate the probability of extreme events when used to model real physical systems , for which an unavoidable cutoff is always present  @xcite .",
    "the most direct way to make the variance finite is by means of _ truncated lvy _ ( tl ) pdfs  @xcite .",
    "the tl pdf is close to a lvy pdf for small argument , but it contains a sharp  @xcite or exponential  @xcite cutoff in the tails .",
    "a _ truncated lvy flight _ ( tlf ) is a random walk in which the step length is chosen from a tl pdf .",
    "the tl pdf belongs to the basin of attraction of the gaussian pdf : for large @xmath0 the sum of @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "tl variables is gaussian - distributed . for small @xmath0",
    "the central part of the pdf of the sum has a lvy shape , but the variance and higher moments are finite . for symmetric tl pdfs the deviation from a gaussian",
    "may be quantified by the value of the normalized fourth cumulant ( kurtosis , @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "this is zero for a gaussian , and positive for a tl pdf .",
    "the crossover to the gaussian regime is given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 the cutoff length .",
    "under this condition , @xmath8 becomes very small ( see eq .  ( 20 ) ) .    in this article ,",
    "the tlf stochastic process is generalized to include a special form of nonlinear dependence of the increments called _",
    "one can build processes with dependent increments such that the central part of the pdf of the sum still approximately behaves as in a lvy flight .",
    "what is remarkable and makes these processes interesting is the fact that the crossover to the gaussian pdf may be pushed to values of @xmath0 which are larger by some order of magnitudes than if the increments were independent .",
    "besides being interesting per se , these processes are of direct of relevance to one of the most noteworthy applications of lf outside physics , i.e. to the modeling of some financial time series  @xcite . from a physicist s perspective , the market is a very good example of a complex system  @xcite in which the mutual interaction and competition among a great number of agents ( traders or speculators ) with continually adapting strategies , together with the influence of unpredictable exogenous factors , usually produces an intricate out - of - equilibrium dynamics .    in the classical equilibrium theory of economy",
    "it is assumed that ",
    "equilibrium \" values for the prices exist , satisfying an aggregate , overall consistency condition ( recalling the so called _ nash _ equilibria solutions of game theory  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the complex dynamics of market prices does not seem to fit this classical picture .",
    "in particular , trading volume and price volatility are much higher than expected from the classical theory  @xcite . from time to time",
    ", the market may display strong movements ( crashes or boosts ) which can not always be understood in terms of rational reactions to incoming new information  @xcite .",
    "instead , some of their features recall the physical concept of self - organized criticality  @xcite .    at last ,",
    "trading volumes and variances of price increments change over time  @xcite , and may persist as low or high for long periods .",
    "the existence of such correlated variance fluctuations ( heteroskedasticity ) is difficult to understand in the framework of classical equilibrium theory , and few economic models can explain it ( see e.g. ref .   where an equilibrium model capable to mimic volatility fluctuations of interest rates is developed )",
    ".    a fundamental source of this complex dynamics may be found in the inductive , subjective and adaptive nature of the process leading agents to formulate the expectations which drive their actions  @xcite , an aspect whose fundamental features can be captured by more or less elaborated game or artificial - life models  @xcite .    aside the  microscopic `` origin of the complexity of financial markets , another aspect of the problem is the phenomenological (  macroscopic '' ) characterization of this complexity , in particular the study of the properties of economic time series .",
    "given the low level of determinism of these series , the most fruitful description is in terms of stochastic processes .",
    "martingale processes  @xcite are the signature of market efficiency . in particular , random walk or brownian - motion models have been used for a long time to model the increments of asset prices  @xcite .",
    "this might be understood by the central limit theorem if price changes resulted from the sum of many independent random contributions , which would seem a reasonable assumption .",
    "indeed , empirical studies of financial time series have revealed gaussian behavior for long time scales , typically of the order of several days .",
    "however , it has been shown  @xcite that for short time scales the central part of the pdf is not gaussian .",
    "it is well described by a lvy distribution , and therefore suggests an underlying lf rather than random - walk model .",
    "non - gaussian scaling has been found in many economical or financial indeces  @xcite . in financial time",
    "series , scale invariance can be characterized ( i.e. the value of the self - similarity exponent @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be extracted ) either by comparing the full pdf of price increments over different time scales , or by studying the time - scale dependence of some selected properties of the pdf .",
    "for example , the probability of return @xmath12 which depends on the time scale @xmath0 as @xmath13 , was used to extract the value @xmath14 in the high - frequency ( one - minute ) variations of the standard & poor s 500 ( s&p500 ) index  @xcite . an alternative quantity which may be used",
    "is the so - called hurst exponent ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .    as with other applications of lf , while lvy distributions describe well the central part of the pdf for short times , the power - law tails of these distributions are much fatter than observed .",
    "in particular , the observed variance is finite .",
    "all the previous remarks suggest the tlf as the best candidate to model these series  @xcite .",
    "two aspects , however , remain unexplained : one is the fact that the crossover to the gaussian regime occurs at much larger times than expected from the tlf model ( and from any model with i.i.d .",
    "increments as well ) .",
    "for example , the one - minute pdf @xmath15 of the s&p500 index increments has kurtosis @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "if the pdf at time @xmath0 , @xmath17 , were @xmath15 convoluted @xmath0 times with itself ( with kurtosis @xmath18 ) , gaussian behavior would be expected for @xmath19 ( see fig .  1 ) . however , the central part of @xmath17 displays lvy behavior up to at least @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the second aspect not accounted for is heteroskedasticity : even if linear correlations are almost zero , there are correlations of the squared increments , i.e. the increments at different times are uncorrelated yet not independent random variables .",
    "put another way , one can not factorize the joint probability density of the increments at different times into the product of reduced densities .",
    "the model proposed in the following can account at the same time for both these aspects .",
    "many efforts have been devoted in the past two decades to the study of time - varying variance , and various models have been put forward by econometricians .",
    "roughly , two great classes of models exist : auto - regressive - conditional - variance ( arch ) type models and stochastic - variance ( sv ) type models .",
    "models of both classes are usually set up in a gaussian framework : if time is discretized with an elementary time step @xmath21 , the increments at the @xmath22-th time - step ( i.e. at @xmath23 ) are assumed to be random variables of the form @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the time - varying mean of the stochastic process ( @xmath25 is very small , and can safely be set to zero , for the short time scales considered here ) , @xmath26 is a random variable representing the time - varying variance of the process , and the @xmath27 are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance , independent of @xmath26 .",
    "arch and sv models differ in the way the @xmath28 process is specified : in arch - type models  @xcite the variance at time - step @xmath22 is a deterministic function of the past squared increments and variances , while in sv - type models  @xcite the variance is not completely determined by the past data , since it contains a random contribution . with suitable choices of their parameters , both type of models can account for the heteroskedasticity and positive kustosis ( leptokurtosis ) of the pdf of financial series , although usually they fail to capture all aspects of the data  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown by numerical simulations in ref .   that the simplest arch - type models do not yield the lvy - type scaling of the pdf described above , since already at short times the value of the scaling exponent is close to the gaussian one .",
    "let us assume the @xmath29 to be zero - mean random variables with variance @xmath30 , with a symmetric pdf @xmath31 depending on the parameter @xmath30 in an as yet unspecified way .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 fluctuates in time following a stationary process .",
    "let @xmath33 be the joint pdf of the variances at the different times , and let us assume the joint pdf of increments and variances @xmath34 i.e. the increments conditional to a certain set of variances @xmath35 are independent variables . however , @xmath36 _ is not directly observable_. the object of measurement is the _ unconditional _ pdf @xmath37 which is only factorized if @xmath38 is .    a special case of process with pdf given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) is @xmath39 where the @xmath40 are independent random variables with zero mean and unit variance , independent of @xmath26 , and with pdf @xmath41 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath42 for this special process the pdf is assumed to change with time only through a time - varying scale factor .",
    "the process reduces to that of eq .",
    "( 3 ) if @xmath43 is gaussian , however @xmath43 does not necessarily need to be gaussian .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "arch - type processes with a @xmath44-student @xmath43 are used .",
    "the characteristic function of @xmath45 is @xmath46 here and in the following @xmath47 indicates the result for the particular case of a scale - factor - type process , eq .",
    "@xmath48 is the characteristic function of @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 can be used  @xcite to calculate moments and cumulants of @xmath45 of any order @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 being moments and cumulants of @xmath43 .",
    "the assumed symmetry of @xmath45 implies that all its odd - order moments vanish . the variance @xmath55 .",
    "the normalized cumulants are @xmath56 the kurtosis @xmath57 is zero for the process of eq .",
    "( 3 ) .      .",
    "for the gaussian - type processes of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , it is easy to extract @xmath58 from a given measured @xmath59 . using eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 9 ) its characteristic function @xmath60 is found to be @xmath61 since @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( the variance has to be positive ) , eq .",
    "( 13 ) is a laplace transform . setting @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the pdf of the variance @xmath58 giving an observed @xmath60 is the inverse laplace transform @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath67 is a symmetric lvy pdf with index @xmath11 , it follows that @xmath58 is itself a lvy pdf eq .",
    "( 1 ) of index @xmath68 and asymmetry @xmath69 , @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "this latter has an essential singularity at @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath67 is a symmetric tl pdf , the singular behavior close to @xmath71 remains , but the decrease of @xmath58 for @xmath72 changes from algebraic to exponential .    for a general process",
    "such laplace - transform relationship is lost . by differentiating @xmath60 at @xmath73 , moments @xmath74 of @xmath59 of any order @xmath51",
    "can be expressed in terms of moments of @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the @xmath51-th - order moment of @xmath75 , eq .  ( 10 ) .",
    "the kurtosis of @xmath59 is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the kurtosis of @xmath43 .",
    "as is well - known , a fluctuating variance ( for which @xmath81 ) can produce a non - gaussian pdf ( @xmath82 ) even when @xmath43 is gaussian ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus , a given measured @xmath84 may be consistent with many different choices of the couple ( @xmath45 , @xmath58 ) , which explains the existence of many econometric models .",
    "for example , the observed leptokurtic character of @xmath84 may arise either from a leptokurtic @xmath43 or from fluctuations of the variance or from both effects .      at time",
    "@xmath86 the characteristic function of the unconditional pdf of the sum , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , is found from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath89 for independent variance fluctuations , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is simply given by @xmath59 convoluted @xmath0 times with itself . in this case",

    "thus , roughly speaking , the slowing down of the decrease of @xmath102 pushes the onset of a gaussian regime ( @xmath104 ) to much larger values of @xmath0 than expected from independent ( or no ) variance fluctuations .",
    "the problem is that for most models , and in particular those of the type of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , these heteroskedastic contributions to @xmath87 may be inconsistent with lvy behavior close to @xmath71 .    to make the variance autocorrelation @xmath99 explicit in @xmath105 , it is convenient to characterize the stochastic process followed by the variances by its multivariate characteristic function @xmath106 . for independent @xmath30 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 being the fourier transform of @xmath58 .",
    "when correlations are present , @xmath106 may be expressed as @xmath109 here @xmath110 , and @xmath111 contains contributions from mixed cumulants of @xmath38 of order higher than two  @xcite , e.g. terms of type @xmath112 or @xmath113 with the time indices @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath10 , @xmath116 not all equal .",

    "it is also possible that for large @xmath127 the contributions of variance fluctuations to @xmath130 be not determined by its small @xmath127 behavior , i.e. by its moments  @xcite . in turn",
    ", this may happen if @xmath38 itself is not uniquely determined by its moments , i.e. @xmath106 has singularities . anyway",
    ", such non - analytic contributions would not yield a lvy scaling in general .",
    "it has been shown above that if the elementary pdf @xmath45 is gaussian , lvy behavior of @xmath91 may be obtained only by making _ ad hoc _ assumptions about @xmath58 and the multivariate structure of variance fluctuations , which looks somewhat artificial .",
    "it is simpler and more intuitive to assume , instead , that for some @xmath32 , @xmath45 itself is equal or close to a tl pdf .",
    "there are many possible ways to choose how the parameter @xmath32 should enter .",
    "if a tl pdf with exponential cutoff at @xmath131@xcite is used for @xmath132 , its variance and kurtosis are , respectively , @xmath133 if the scaling exponent @xmath11 is fixed , a time - varying @xmath32 may occur either through variations of @xmath134 ( these reflect variations of trading volumes in economic applications ) , or variations of the cutoff @xmath135 or of both .",
    "although the central part of a superposition of tl pdfs with varying @xmath134 does not have an exact lvy behavior , this behavior still exists approximately for many choices of @xmath58 , i.e. one can find a lvy pdf with the same @xmath11 and an effective @xmath134 which describes approximately the central part of the superposition . for example , if @xmath32 or @xmath134 have a lognormal pdf ( given that @xmath32 , @xmath136 this is a simple possible candidate pdf ) , the central part of the superposition is dominated by the @xmath134 corresponding to the peak of the lognormal ( non - gaussian region , high kurtosis ) , while the tail for @xmath137 ( quasi - gaussian region , small kurtosis ) mostly affects the tails of the superposition . in general , the smaller values of @xmath134 determine the small @xmath125 behavior of @xmath59 .",
    "on the other hand , the central part of a superposition of tl pdfs with varying cutoff @xmath135 keeps an almost exact lvy behavior , since @xmath135 only affects the tails of the pdf .    in the following we focus on some qualitative features of tlf with correlated fluctuations of the variance .",
    "we study the simplest conceivable non trivial model , which nevertheless contains the relevant features of this type of processes , and has the advantage that an accurate numerical evaluation of @xmath91 can be made without approximations .",
    "the variance is assumed to fluctuate between two possible values only , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "thus , @xmath141 .",
    "if @xmath142 one may view @xmath58 as a stylized lognormal pdf , with @xmath138 representing the position of the maximum and @xmath139 representing the tail of the lognormal .",

    "@xmath144 is assumed to be gaussian with variance @xmath139 .",
    "thus , @xmath145 .    for the stochastic process followed by the variances ,",
    "the simplest choice is a markov chain  @xcite .",

    "if the condition that the markov chain be stationary is imposed , two free parameters , i.e. @xmath146 , and @xmath149 , are left for the chain .",
