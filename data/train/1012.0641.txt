    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are very fascinating cosmic objects in the universe . since its discovery in 1973 ( klebesadel et al . 1973 ) , grbs opened up a new domain of astrophysical research due to the rich observational characteristics of the afterglows in a vast range of electromagnetic spectrum from @xmath5-rays to radio wavelengths ( see gehrels et al .",
    "2009 for a review ) .",
    "there is a general consensus in the literature that the diverse observational characteristics are due to the interaction of relativistic matter with the surrounding medium .",
    "the nature and energy source for this relativistic matter , particularly in the context of the long grbs , could be in the nature of bulk motion of ions ( the fire ball model - see e.g. , piran 2004 ) , cannon balls emitted from a compact object newly formed in a supernova explosion ( dar 2006 ) , or particles accelerated by magnetized winds ( the electro - magnetic model - see lyutikov 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the long grbs are associated with supernovae and it is believed that relativistic matter of very high bulk lorentz factor is generated in a conical jet during the collapse of a massive star at cosmological distances ( see for example , meszaros 2002 ) .",
    "the prompt gamma - ray emission has several characteristic correlations like the peak energy @xmath4 against the isotropic luminosity @xmath6 ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) , spectral lag against the peak luminosity ( norris et al . 2000 ) etc .",
    "( see gehrels et al .",
    "2009 , for a summary of such correlations ) and these relations are used even in predicting the red shift of long duration gamma - ray bursts , although with a large uncertainty ( close to a factor of 2 , see , for example xiao & schaefer 2009 ) . a detailed understanding of the prompt emission is necessary to put these correlations in a firm footing so that grbs can be used as cosmological candles and also to have a clear understanding of the central engine and the basic jet / cannon - ball emission mechanism .",
    "the morphology or temporal profile of the grbs during the prompt emission varies asymmetrically with no apparent structure among the bursts .",
    "some grbs show multiple pulses and the individual pulses in a burst is a separate and unique emission with varying amplitude and intensity . in the frame work of fireball model",
    "( see , zhang 2007 and meszaros 2002 for reviews ) these pulses are created with different shock strengths at different locations of the jet .",
    "observations suggest that in most of the bursts , an individual pulse profile is in the shape of fast - rise - exponential - decay ( fred ) , with the width decreasing with energy ( fenimore et al .",
    "1995 ; norris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "spectral lag is another spectro - temporal property which is crucial to understand the dynamics and energetics of grbs and can constrain the grb models ( ioka & nakamura 2001 ; shen et al .",
    "2005 ; lu et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "grb  090618 is a very interesting object for several reasons .",
    "it is bright and relatively nearby ( redshift @xmath7 0.5 ) making it a good candidate to expect to have a visible supernova ( if it is like sn1998bw - see dado & dar 2010 ) , though no supernova has yet been associated with this grb .",
    "further , its intense hard x - ray and gamma - ray emission during the prompt phase enables one to make a time resolved spectral analysis ( see for example , ghirlanda et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this paper",
    ", we make a detailed analysis of the prompt emission in a wide band x - ray and gamma - ray region using data from swift/ bat and the @xmath0 - 2 experiment onboard the @xmath1 satellite ( preliminary results are given in rao et al .",
    "2009 ) . since this is the first result from this experiment , we describe in detail the methodology used in deriving the response matrix and spectral fitting .",
    "we augment our results by using the publicly available @xmath3 bat data and make a combined spectral fit .",
    "we examine the spectral and temporal characteristics of the individual pulses during the prompt emission of this grb and investigate the implications to the source emission mechanisms . in  2 ,",
    "a summary of observations on grb  090618 is given and in  3 a brief description of the @xmath0 - 2 experiment is given .",
    "observations and analysis results ( @xmath0 - 2 and bat data ) are given in  4 and finally in  5 , a discussion of the results are presented along with relevant conclusions .",

    "the number of photons registered in the detectors as a function of energy is normalized to the incident photons for a grb model with the spectral parameters of @xmath16 = -0.32 , @xmath17 = -5.0 and e@xmath9 = 67.7 kev .",
    "the results are insensitive to model parameters ( see later ) .",
    "this normalization is deemed as the effective area of the detectors .",
    "the derived effective areas for the nai and csi detectors are shown in figure  5 . since the effective area of csi is about an order of magnitude larger than the nai detector , we have taken only the csi data ( and the corresponding response function ) for our spectral fitting .",
    "the response matrix for the @xmath0 - 2 detectors are generated using the @xmath50 tool of @xmath51 .",
    "the channel - energy conversion is derived from the background spectral line at @xmath758.0 kev ( nandi et al .",
    "2009 ) and 122 kev line due to the onboard calibration source ( co@xmath52 ) and the energy resolution function is taken from the ground calibrations .",
    "using this response matrix , a joint fit to the @xmath0 - 2 and bat data is performed . from the derived best fit spectral parameters , mc simulation",
    "is again carried out and the @xmath0 - 2 response matrix is again created .",
    "convergent results were obtained in the first trial itself , indicating that direct blocking from the surrounding material and interaction with detector play a major part of the response and the second order effects like scattering are unimportant for response matrix generation , at least to the level of sensitivity achieved for grb  090618 .    except for a 2 mm aluminum filter in @xmath0 - 2/g ,",
    "both the detectors are identical in performance .",
    "the setting for deriving the onboard counts in the high energy channels is lower in @xmath0 - 2/s and hence we have a single energy bin above 215 kev in @xmath0 - 2/s ( compared to the two energy bins in @xmath0 - 2/g ) .",
    "though we get consistent spectral results for both the detectors , we report the spectral parameters derived from @xmath0 - 2/s which has better spectral response above 100 kev . while making a simultaneous fit to the bat data , we kept the relative area between @xmath0 - 2 and bat as a free parameter and it is derived to be @xmath53 for the combined fit to the full data .",
    "the relative area between @xmath0 - 2 g1 and g2 , however , is kept fixed at what is dictated by the response matrix . for the time resolved",
    "spectral fit the relative area between @xmath0 - 2 and bat is kept fixed at the value obtained for the full data ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) .",
    "the spectrum can be well fitted with the model introduced by band et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . in this model ,",
    "two power - laws are smoothly joined at @xmath54e@xmath9 , where @xmath16 is the first power - law index and @xmath17 is the second power - law index , and e@xmath9 is the break energy .",
    "the best fit spectral parameters are given in table  3 , along with the calculated peak energy e@xmath55",
    "(= e@xmath9 ( 2 + @xmath16 ) ) and the best fit @xmath37 and the degrees of freedom used for the fitting .",
    "figure  6 shows the best fit model along with the unfolded spectrum .",
    "we divided the bat data in 4 parts and for each part we perform the spectral analysis . since @xmath0 - 2",
    "does not have time - resolved spectral data , we have used the count rates as broad spectral data for this time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "the results are shown in table  3 . timing analysis parameters ( width index @xmath43 and delay index @xmath46 )",
    "are also given in table  3 .",
    "we note that the spectral results agree quite well with that obtained from the @xmath56 data ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "the values of e@xmath55 , derived in the present work , are 264 kev , 248 kev , 129 kev , and 33 kev respectively for the four parts which compares well with the value of 296 kev , 319 kev , 180 kev , and 81 kev derived for the peak of the light curves in these regions in the @xmath56 data ( time ranges , after t@xmath9 , of 3  14 s , 63  67 s , 80 ",
    "85 s , and 114  130 s , respectively ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a method to measure the spectral parameters of the prompt emission using the recently launched @xmath0 - 2 detectors and the swift - bat .",
    "though @xmath0 - 2 has been made to primarily study solar activities , we find that above @xmath7 50 kev , @xmath0 - 2 essentially acts as an all sky hard x - ray monitor .",
    "thus , it can be used to measure the spectral and timing characteristics of the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "grb  090618 shows multiple peaks .",
    "it shows a systematic softening of the spectrum for the successive pulses which is associated with the variations in the timing parameters .",
    "for the successive peaks in the grb , the peak energy shifts to lower values , the width of the pulse varies sharply with energy and the delay ( which is lower for the latter pulses ) as a function of energy shows a flatter dependence on energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 , characterizing the dependence of the pulse width with energy , also shows a strong pulse ( and hence time ) dependence .",
    "fenimore et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used the width of individual pulses in several grbs detected by batse and showed that the dependence on energy is a power - law , with an index of @xmath70.4 .",
    "borgonovo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) measured the width of several grbs of known redshifts and found that @xmath43 shows a continuous distribution .",
    "a large number of bursts in their work show @xmath43 to be peaking around 0.1  0.2 .",
    "it appears that grb  090618 belongs to this class of grb with a narrow distribution of @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , though the value of @xmath43 changes from pulse to pulse in this grb , it is in the range of 0  0.1 .",
    "various explanations are offered to understand the lags seen in grbs .",
    "shen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have estimated the contributions from the relativistic curvature effect .",
    "these effects can explain contributions to the lag of the order of 10@xmath57  10@xmath15 s. the lags observed in grb  090618 is much larger than this and hence quite unlikely to be due to the curvature effect .",
    "ioka & nakamura ( 2001 ) have computed the kinematic dependence of lag caused by the viewing angle which could produce the observed dependences .",
    "the systematic pulse - to - pulse variation of the properties detected in grb  090618 , however , would be difficult to understand in this framework .",
    "spectral evolution , too , can reproduce some part of the lag ( kocevski & liang 2003 ; hafizi & mochkovitch 2007 ) .",
    "the results from the present observations support the conclusion of hakkila et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that the spectral lags are pulse rather than burst properties",
    ".    the individual pulses in a grb could be either due to emission from multiple shock locations when a jet material encounters the supernova ejecta or due to the weakening of the relativistic matter and/or the emission of a fresh relativistic matter from the central engine .",
    "detection of properties of a grb pulse quite different from the previous pulses has implications for the nature of the central engine .",
    "if the central engine is shown to emit multiple ejection episodes it will strongly favor a black hole as the candidate as against a highly magnetized neutron star ( see for example , metzger 2010 for a discussion on the grb central engines ) . in the case of grb  090618",
    ", there is a marginal evidence for the last pulse ( pulse 4 ) to be different and could be a candidate for a separate emission from the central engine . a detailed study of several such multi - peaked bursts are required to draw a firm conclusion . for example , discovery of a hard grb pulse , after a x - ray pulse , would certainly favor a black hole as a candidate for the central engine .",
    "we have calculated the isotropic energy ( e@xmath58 ) for this grb by considering a standard cosmology model for a flat universe with q@xmath9 = 1/2 and h@xmath9 = 70 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 .",
    "using the measured redshift of 0.54 and the measured integrated fluence in the energy range of 20 kev to 1 mev of 2.8 x 10@xmath18 ergs @xmath13 , we calculate e@xmath58 to be 2.21 @xmath11 10@xmath59 ergs ( beaming effects are neglected ) .",
    "the measured time - averaged peak energy ( e@xmath55 ) for the entire burst is around 164 kev , which gives the intrinsic peak energy ( e@xmath60 ) of 252 kev .",
    "based on the measured values of e@xmath60 and e@xmath58 , it is found that the grb  090618 closely follows the ` amati ' relation with a minor deviation , which is within the 2@xmath39 scatter .",
    "hence , it could be concluded that grb  090618 is a standard candle for the category of long duration grbs alongwith various intrinsic properties that are discussed in this paper .",
    "the recent detection of polarization in grb  090102 ( steele et al . 2009 ) indicates the presence of ordered magnetic field in the source of grbs during the prompt emission .",
    "the present measurement of the spectral and temporal parameters of grb  090618 shows that the individual pulses show distinct behaviors .",
    "this work was made possible in part from a grant from indian space research organization ( isro ) . the whole - hearted support from g. madhavan nair , ex - chairman , isro , who initiated the @xmath0 - 2 project , is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "significant contributions from several organizations for the realization of the @xmath0 - 2 payload is gratefully acknowledged .",
