    "the recombination of hydrogen on the surfaces of microscopic dust grains in the interstellar medium has attracted much interest in recent years .",

    "the rate equations used in ref .",

    "they provide the time evolution of the average densities of atoms and molecules on the surface , while fluctuations are neglected .",
    "such rate equations are expected to provide good results for macroscopic surfaces .",
    "however , it turns out that they may be unsuitable for the study of hydrogen recombination in the interstellar medium due to the small grain size and low flux @xcite . under these conditions the number of h atoms on the surface of a grain may be very small and fluctuations are expected to be significant .",
    "attempts to resolve this difficulty included the use of modified rate equations in which parameters are changed to account for the finite grain size @xcite .",
    "monte carlo methods were also used , to simulate the surface diffusion and reaction processes on small grains @xcite .",
    "the class of monte carlo methods that are suitable for such activated processes on the surface , away from thermal equilibrium , are the continuous time or kinetic monte carlo techniques @xcite . in these simulations , at each time step , the next move is picked with a probability proportional to its rate .",
    "the elapsed time is given , according to the theory of stochastic processes , by the inverse of the sum of the rates of all processes that could have occurred at that time .",

    "for example , the calculation of averages for quantities such as the h@xmath0 formation rate is done by collecting large amounts of statistical information @xcite . to study the chemistry of interstellar clouds one needs a model that couples the gas - phase and grain - surface reactions .",

    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the h@xmath0 formation process under steady state conditions as a function of the physical parameters .",

    "the recombination efficiency is thus sharply reduced as the grain size further decreases .    in conclusion , we observe that in both the first and second order kinetics the recombination efficiency on a grain ( given by the master equation ) starts to deviate from the rate equation result when the grain size ( represented by @xmath83 ) becomes the smallest length scale in the problem . in the first order case this happens when @xmath203 while in the second order case it happens when @xmath204 .",
