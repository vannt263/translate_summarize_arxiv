    "there seem to be some remarkable similarities between high - temperature cuprate superconductivity in condensed matter physics and the problem of mass gap in the yang - mills theory of particle physics .",
    "it appears that in both cases the basic theoretical problem is the same , the absence of a natural condensate to describe the symmetry breaking that takes place . in high - temperature superconductors electrons",
    "do not form conventional cooper pairs and the standard bcs - description of superconductivity can not be applied in any obvious manner .",
    "there is no obvious alternative choice of condensate that leads to superconductivity . in a very similar way , in the case of yang - mills theories we do not have any natural candidate for a condensate of the correct dimension , that describes the mass gap of gluons .",
    "could it then be that in both cases the condensate has a similar origin ?",
    "it is definitely worth some effort to try and apply similar techniques to both problems .",
    "one promising method in the context of high temperature superconductivity is the slave - boson description , which has been studied actively @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the curious idea that , in the strongly correlated environment of cuprate superconductors , the electron ( or hole ) is no longer a fundamental mode of excitation , and thus electronic modes do not behave like a structureless fundamental object . instead",
    "the electron can be interpreted as a composite particle , constructed from two quasi - particles .",
    "one of these is described by a charge neutral , spin-@xmath1 fermionic operator @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the site label and @xmath4 is the spin index .",
    "this operator corresponds to a particle called a spinon , and it carries the ( statistical ) spin degree of freedom of the electron .",
    "the other excitation is described by a spinless bosonic operator @xmath5 .",
    "it corresponds to a particle which is called a holon and it carries the electric charge of the electron . in terms of these two operators ,",
    "the electron operator @xmath6 decomposes as @xmath7 where we have combined the spinon operators as @xmath8 the decomposition ( [ comp ] ) also introduces an internal @xmath9 gauge symmetry , since it is invariant under the simultaneous change - of - phase transformation @xmath10 as a result we have a compact @xmath9 gauge interaction between the spinon and holon . under normal circumstances",
    "we expect that the strength of this @xmath9 interaction increases with increasing energy , to the effect that at high energies the spinon and holon are confined into a ( point - like ) electron .",
    "but in a strongly correlated environment , such as in a cuprate superconductor , the spin and the charge of the electron can become independent excitations @xcite .",
    "this leads to a rather involved phase diagram , with several different regions @xcite .",
    "one of the easiest ways to study the phase structure is using a mean - field theory .",
    "this is obtained by integrating over the fermions @xmath11 , and one finds that ( @xmath12-wave ) superconductivity occurs when the remaining bosonic holon field @xmath13 condenses , @xmath14 of substantial interest is also the possibility that the system can enter a pseudogap phase .",
    "this is a precursor to the superconducting phase with the characteristic property that even though the underlying symmetry is broken , the effective bosonic order parameter @xmath15 vanishes due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "curiously , a very similar picture seems to emerge in the case of a pure four dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills theory . in analogy to the slave - boson decomposition of an electron , the off - diagonal components of the non - abelian gluon field become composite particles , with a separation between their color - charge and spin degrees of freedom @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "here we shall study the phase structure of the decomposed gauge theory , by following the mean - field approach to high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "we first construct a mean - field state where we integrate over the charge neutral spin degree of freedom of the off - diagonal gluon .",
    "we propose that in the strong coupling regime the spinless color - charge carrier of the gluon becomes condensed .",
    "the ensuing phase is analogous to the superconducting phase in cuprates .",
    "furthermore , in analogy with cuprate superconductors we also find evidence that there is an intermediate pseudogap phase , a cross - over region between the superconducting - like phase and the asymptotically - free deconfined limit of the yang - mills theory .",
    "the slave - boson decomposition of the @xmath0 gauge field @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) proceeds as follows @xcite : we first separate the diagonal cartan component @xmath19 from the off - diagonal components @xmath20 , and combine the latter into the complex field @xmath21 .",
    "we then introduce a complex vector field @xmath22 with @xmath23 we also introduce two spinless complex scalar fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the ensuing decomposition of @xmath26 is @xcite @xmath27 this is clearly a direct analogue of eq .",
    "( [ comp ] ) , a decomposition of @xmath26 into spinless bosonic scalars @xmath28 which describe the gluonic holons that carry the color charge of the @xmath26 , and a color - neutral spin - one vector @xmath22 which is the gluonic spinon that carries the statistical spin degrees of freedom of @xmath26 .",
    "in general , the present gluonic slave - boson decomposition is not gauge invariant .",
    "but in a proper gauge it can be given a gauge invariant meaning and in particular the combination @xmath29 of the gluonic holons becomes a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "for this we introduce @xcite @xmath30 = \\int w_\\mu w_\\mu^ *   \\label{gf}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is in general gauge dependent .",
    "but if we consider the gauge orbit extrema of ( [ gf ] ) with respect to the full @xmath0 gauge transformations , these extrema are by construction gauge independent quantities . moreover , the gauge orbit extrema of ( [ gf ] ) correspond to field configurations @xmath26 which are subject to a background version of the maximal abelian gauge @xcite , @xmath31 which is widely used in lattice studies @xcite . in the sequel",
    "we shall assume that the gauge fixing condition ( [ mag ] ) has been implemented .",
    "the slave - boson decomposition then acquires a gauge invariant meaning , and in particular the condensate ( [ zakh ] ) is a gauge invariant quantity .    as in ( [ compact1 ] ) , the decomposition ( [ dec1 ] ) remains intact when we change phases according to @xmath32 this determines an internal compact @xmath9 gauge structure .",
    "a compact @xmath9 gauge theory is known to be confining when the coupling is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "the confining phase is separated by a first order phase transition from the deconfined weak coupling phase .",
    "furthermore , since the running of the @xmath33-function of the compact @xmath9 leads to an increase of the coupling with increasing energy , we expect that at high energy the gluonic holon and spinon become confined by an increasingly strong compact @xmath9 interaction to the effect that the high energy yang - mills theory describes asymptotically free and pointlike gluons , as it should .",
    "but at low energy and in a strongly correlated environment , maybe in the interior of hadronic particles , the internal @xmath9 gauge interaction ( [ intu1 ] ) can become weak and the spin and the color - charge degrees of freedom of the gluon can separate from each other .",
    "if in analogy with ( [ conden1 ] ) the spinless color - carriers then condense @xmath34 we have a mass gap and the theory is in a phase which is very similar to the holon condensation phase of cuprate superconductors .    in the case of high - temperature superconductivity",
    "the basic criterion for the validity of the slave - boson decomposition is a dynamic one : the decomposition can occur only if the ensuing hamiltonian admits a natural interpretation in terms of the decomposed variables .",
    "in particular , in the relevant background the holon and spinon operators should indeed describe proper particle states .",
    "we propose that the same criterion can also be adopted to yang - mills theories .",
    "a decomposition of the gauge field @xmath16 in terms of other fields leads to a valid description of the phase structure , only if the decomposed action has a natural structure and particle interpretation in terms of the new variables . in the case of eq .",
    "( [ dec1 ] ) this criterion turns out to be satisfied .",
    "if we write the yang - mills action in terms of the decomposed variables , it admits a natural interpretation as a two - gap abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the present yang - mills version of the slave - boson decomposition might actually identify the correct dynamical degrees of freedom that describe the non - perturbative phases of the theory .",
    "in the case of cuprate superconductors , the phase structure can be investigated using a mean - field theory that emerges when the original theory is averaged over the electronic spinon field .",
    "we now proceed in an analogous manner , and average the @xmath0 yang - mills action both over the color - spinon @xmath22 and the cartan component @xmath35 of the gauge field .",
    "since we are only interested in the phase structure of the ensuing mean - field theory , it is sufficient to consider the free energy in a london limit where the slave - boson condensates @xmath36 are spatially uniform .",
    "the integration over @xmath35 and @xmath22 can be performed in various different ways .",

    "the generic features of this potential , a ridge along the lines @xmath59 , and a narrow hyperbolic valley on both sides of these lines , are independent of @xmath60 , but the depth of the valleys and steepness of the potential are more prominent for larger values of @xmath60 , as used here .",

    "in particular , if @xmath66 in ( [ lisa1b ] ) is large , the strong coupling limit @xmath67 in ( [ lisa2 ] ) , does not necessarily correspond to a strong coupling limit of the original model ( [ lisa1b ] ) .",

    "[ fig : alphabeta ] ) are increasing functions of @xmath141 , and will provide us with a second expansion parameter .",
    "now we separate variable in @xmath162 and @xmath141 as before , @xmath170 which leads us to the following generalization of ( [ sequ ] ) @xmath171 we now ignore all but the first three terms it can be verified numerically that all other terms are small  and separate variables @xmath172 the value @xmath169 is larger than @xmath173 , its value when @xmath122 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphabeta ] . the eigenvalue @xmath174 is larger than @xmath175 , if we take @xmath141 large enough so that @xmath176 , see fig .",

    "[ color online.],width=302 ]    the equation for @xmath179 is interesting for other reasons as well ; as shown in figure  [ fig : lowestf2 ] , we find that for large values of @xmath60 the wave function separates into two parts . remembering that @xmath180 corresponds to the lines @xmath59 , this supports our assertion that the wave function separates in 4 disjoint parts for large @xmath60 .      in the region of large coupling ,",
    "the hyperbolic valleys of the free energy become very deep .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotics of the ground state wave function , when it becomes separated into four disjoint components .",
    "we continue to utilize the hyperbolic coordinates , but we shall now expand around the minima of the free energy .    in hyperbolic coordinates ,",
    "the minimum of the free energy @xmath182 remains very close to @xmath183 ( less than @xmath184 which is the value for @xmath185 ) .",
    "consequently the previous asymptotic analysis remains valid , and we can immediately conclude that the wave functions are decaying rapidly",
    ".    however , it is also of interest to consider the limit of a very deep potential directly , and for this we introduce coordinates from the minimum , scaled with @xmath186 , @xmath187 we then expand in powers of @xmath162 , keeping leading terms only .",
    "the hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath188 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx&-\\frac{1}{\\xi_{0}m}\\sqrt{(1+y^{2}}(\\partial_{xx } + \\partial_{yy})+2\\lambda\\xi_{0}^{2}(-1 + 2x^{2})\\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath189 and @xmath190 we this leads to the eigenvalue problem @xmath191 we now wish to consider the properties of solutions to this schrdinger equation : we substitute @xmath192 with @xmath193 when we ignore terms containing lower order or mixed derivatives in addition of powers of @xmath162 , we find that the equation takes the form @xmath194 assuming again the lowest harmonic oscillator eigenstate for @xmath149 , @xmath195 with @xmath196 we find for @xmath150 , @xmath197 in order to obtain an analytic solution we shall assume @xmath167 to be so large that we again can make the harmonic approximation .",
    "this gives @xmath198 thus @xmath199 with @xmath200 , and the ground state energy is given by @xmath201 the energy for the original problem can thus be expressed as @xmath202 which is a good approximation only when the wave function @xmath203 has no overlap with those from the remaining three valleys - and when our harmonic approximations are valid .",
    "we also conclude that the scaling of the condensates observed in the previous section is indeed taking place ; the width of both @xmath149 and @xmath150 depends on the combination @xmath204 , and for large @xmath60 @xmath186 is approximately constant , leading to the observed scaling in @xmath112 . since the wave function contract slowly to the maximum point ( most slowly for @xmath150 ) , we find that indeed we have in the limit @xmath133 the case where one of the two condensates disappears , as stated above .",
    "a further numerical analysis using the separated wave function confirms that this approach is very slow , and we must go to extremely high values of @xmath60 to see the point where we ca nt distinguish between the maximum and the expectation value of @xmath116 .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the phase structure of pure @xmath0 yang - mills theory using a slave - boson decomposition of the gauge field .",
    "we have employed a mean - field approximation where we account only for spatially homogeneous fluctuations in the gluonic holon fields .",
    "our analysis suggests that the decomposed theory has an involved phase diagram , resembling that of cuprate superconductors . at intermediate couplings",
    ", there seems to be a gapped phase which is separated from the asymptotically free high energy limit by a pseudogap phase .",
    "furthermore , we find that a mass gap appears to persists in the strong coupling limit even though asymptotically one of the two holon condensates appears to vanishes .",
    "in our analysis we have employed a version of the maximal abelian gauge . in this gauge",
    "we have the advantage , that many results are available from first principle lattice simulations ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "in particular , it has been observed @xcite that the ( electric ) confinement of color relates to the condensation of magnetic monopoles in the dual higgs phase .",
    "here we have inspected a ( renormalization group invariant ) perturbative one - loop approximation to the yang - mills effective action , in terms of decomposed variables that have a natural magnetic interpretation .",
    "our results do not account for topologically nontrivial configurations , consequently it is not directly clear how our results could relate to the ( electric ) color confinement as observed in the lattice simulations . for a comparison ,",
    "we need a first principles numerical lattice analysis in terms of the separated spin and charge variables .",
    "we also need a better understanding of electric - magnetic duality in terms of these variables .",
    "however , even at the level of the ( crude ) approximation that we employ here , it appears that when formulated in terms of the separate spin and charge variables the yang - mills theory has a very rich phase structure , not easily described in terms of the conventional gluonic variables .",
    "our results suggests that the possibility of a spin - charge separation in the yang - mills theory may occur , and deserves to be addressed by extensive first - principles lattice simulations .",
    "furthermore , there is a need to address theoretical issues such as electric - magnetic duality and the description of the yang - mills theory in terms of the spin - charge separated dual variables .",
