    "the question of the nature of dark matter is still one of the unsolved mysteries in modern cosmology .",
    "many particle candidates have been put forward , but until now the only dark matter evidence we have is based on the gravitational interaction . in the context of supersymmetry with conserved @xmath0-parity",
    ", one naturally encounters one of the most favoured solutions to the dark matter problem .",
    "there , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and can be a successful dark matter candidate if it is neutral and weakly interacting like the neutralino .",
    "the neutralino is the most thoroughly studied dark matter candidate and will be tested in the near future in accelerator , direct detection and indirect detection experiments  @xcite .    on the other hand , it is also possible that the dark matter interacts only gravitationally , and supersymmetry also offers candidates of this type .",
    "a prominent example is the gravitino , the superpartner of the graviton , which was the first supersymmetric dark matter candidate proposed  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most elusive dark matter candidates due to its extremely weak interactions .",
    "in fact , as part of the gravity multiplet , all gravitino interactions are suppressed either by the planck scale ( for the spin-3/2 component ) or by the supersymmetry - breaking scale ( for the goldstino component ) .",
    "usually , having an lsp with such extremely weak interactions poses a severe problem to big bang nucleosynthesis , as it makes the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) so long - lived that it decays during or after the formation of the primordial nuclei , typically spoiling the successful predictions of the standard scenario  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the nlsp is charged , the formation of a bound state with @xmath1he catalyzes the production of @xmath2li  @xcite leading to an overproduction of @xmath2li by a factor 300 - 600  @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid these constraints is to lower the scale of supersymmetry breaking , thus enhancing the goldstino interactions .",
    "however , the reheating temperature of the universe has to be lowered accordingly in order to avoid overclosure  @xcite and is then in conflict with the minimal value required by thermal leptogenesis in order to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "it was recently proposed in  @xcite that these problems are automatically solved if a small breaking of @xmath0-parity is introduced in the model . even though in the presence of @xmath0-parity violation the neutralino lsp is too short - lived to play the role of dark matter",
    ", the gravitino lsp can still have a sufficiently long lifetime , which is typically many orders of magnitude greater than the age of the universe due to the suppression of the decay rate by the planck scale and the small @xmath0-parity violating couplings  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the nlsp population in the early universe quickly decays into standard model particles via @xmath0-parity violating interactions .",
    "apart from the presence of a rather inert population of gravitinos , produced thermally from superpartner scatterings at reheating , the cosmology then reduces to the non - supersymmetric case well before the synthesis of primordial nuclei .",
    "an intriguing feature of the scenario with @xmath0-parity breaking is that gravitino dark matter is not necessarily invisible anymore , since it will decay into standard model particles at a very slow rate . since the huge number of gravitinos in our own galaxy , as well as in nearby galaxies and clusters ,",
    "may compensate for the highly suppressed decay rate , this opens up the possibility of observing the dark matter decay products as an anomalous contribution to the diffuse gamma - ray flux  @xcite or the cosmic - ray antimatter fluxes  @xcite . indeed , anomalous excesses have been observed both in the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray spectrum and in the positron fraction in similar energy ranges .",
    "it has been pointed out that the decay of gravitino dark matter with a lifetime of @xmath3 and a mass of @xmath4 can account for both of these excesses at the same time  @xcite .",
    "this motivates our study of the corresponding neutrino spectrum for the same choice of parameters , both as a consistency check and to find out whether in this scenario an anomalous contribution to the neutrino flux may be expected in present and future neutrino experiments .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in the next section we will briefly review bilinear @xmath0-parity violating models and discuss the resulting gravitino decay modes . in section  [ spectrum ]",
    "we will present the neutrino spectrum from dark matter decay and describe its main features . in section  [ fluxes ]",
    "we will then give the neutrino flux as a function of the gravitino lifetime and mass both for neutrinos from our own galaxy and from diffuse extragalactic sources and consider the effect of neutrino oscillations on the signal expected at the earth .",
    "in section  [ backgrounds ] we will discuss the different neutrino backgrounds in the energy range we are interested in and compare them to our signal . in section  [ detection ] we will propose strategies to disentangle the signal from the background , compare the result to present neutrino data from super - kamiokande .",
    "we will then discuss the feasibility of detection in future detectors in section  [ future ] and conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider here a model of the type described in detail in  @xcite , where the breaking of @xmath0-parity is related to the breaking of @xmath5 . in this class of models ,",
    "the lepton number violation in the superpotential is encoded in the bilinear term  @xcite @xmath6 it can be shown that the @xmath0-parity violating coupling @xmath7 is suppressed compared to the coefficient @xmath8 of the @xmath0-parity conserving bilinear term @xmath9 by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the scale of @xmath5 breaking and the planck mass , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the induced baryon number violation is negligible , the corresponding yukawa coupling being further suppressed by the ratio of the gravitino mass to the planck mass and a higher power of the scale of @xmath5 breaking over the planck scale , @xmath13 .",
    "then , if the scale of @xmath5 breaking is low enough , the constraints on proton stability are satisfied and the lepton number violating interactions are kept out of equilibrium before the electroweak phase transition , thus preventing the erasure of any previously generated baryon asymmetry .",
    "this condition requires approximately @xmath14  @xcite , which translates into @xmath15@xmath16gev , although this could be circumvented for some specific flavour structures in the yukawa couplings . since the present bounds on the gravitino lifetime are already constraining the parameters at this order from observations of both gamma rays  @xcite and antiprotons  @xcite , this last option is probably not viable .",
    "apart from the supersymmetric term above , the corresponding soft bilinear super - symmetry - breaking term @xmath17 arises in the lagrangian . since the @xmath18 and @xmath19 terms",
    "are not usually aligned at the weak scale , a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( _ v.e.v .",
    "_ ) is generated along the sneutrino field direction explicitly breaking lepton number and generating not only one neutrino mass , but also non - vanishing mixings between neutralinos and neutrinos , as well as between charginos and charged leptons  @xcite .",
    "such mixings are responsible for the two - body decays of the gravitino into gauge boson and neutrino , which are the main source of neutrino flux in our scenario .",
    "these decays are also possible at the one - loop level if only trilinear @xmath0-parity breaking terms are considered , and even in this case they can dominate in part of the parameter space  @xcite . since the neutralino  neutrino mixing takes place along the zino component , the branching ratios into the different gauge boson channels are fixed by the neutralino mixing matrix once the gravitino mass is specified .",
    "if the gravitino is lighter than the massive gauge bosons , the dominant decay channel is the two - body decay into monoenergetic photon and neutrino . since all the observed",
    "yukawa couplings are largest for the third generation , it is reasonable to assume that the @xmath0-parity breaking couplings are also largest for the third generation .",
    "thus , the sneutrino acquires a _",
    "_ only along the @xmath20 direction , and the gravitino will dominantly decay into neutrinos with @xmath21 flavour .",
    "we will see later that this is not a crucial assumption , since neutrino oscillations change any pure neutrino flavour into a mixed state .",
    "in particular , due to maximal atmospheric mixing , the flux of tau and muon neutrinos turns out to be identical .    if instead the gravitino is heavier than the electroweak gauge bosons , the decay into these particles is favoured , since the sneutrino has electroweak charge . in this case , neutrinos are produced not only in the direct decay into @xmath22 , but also in the fragmentation of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bosons and the decay of the @xmath25 leptons , thus adding a continuous component to the spectrum . in this paper",
    ", we will mostly consider the second case of a heavier gravitino , motivated by the interpretation of anomalies in other channels as explained above .",
    "furthermore , at lower gravitino masses , the detection of any signal is much more difficult due to the lower neutrino yield and the smaller signal - to - background ratio .      in the models with bilinear @xmath0-parity breaking and a non - zero sneutrino _",
    "_ along the @xmath20 direction , the main decay channels for the gravitino are : @xmath26 the first decay is practically always allowed , while the next two are open only for a gravitino mass above the threshold for @xmath27 or @xmath24 production . at even higher masses , the decay into higgs boson and neutrino opens up via the higgsino component of the neutralino and the @xmath0-parity violating higgs  sneutrino mixing .",
    "we will consider here the case of a large higgs mass parameter @xmath28 , where the lightest higgs is standard model - like and the other higgses decouple .",
    "the decay widths for these processes can be computed from the interaction lagrangian of a gravitino with a gauge boson and a gaugino or with the two chiral higgs multiplets with the insertion of a sneutrino _ v.e.v .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the decays into electroweak gauge bosons arise both from 3vertices and from the non - abelian 4vertex , so their structure is more complicated than for the abelian sector .",

    "however , this analysis does not exploit the information about the spectral shape of the signal apart from setting a threshold for @xmath76 lepton production , i.e. @xmath77 , so this kind of data analysis could certainly be improved to search for a signal with a peak above the continuum , as in our case .    despite the experimental difficulties , it is worthwhile to examine the theoretically expected signal in the tau channel .",

    "we clearly see again that the tau neutrino channel in the down - going direction allows to constrain the gravitino lifetime a few orders of magnitude better than the muon or electron neutrino fluxes .",
    "on the other hand , similar plots for the gamma - ray channel  @xcite are even more sensitive and give bounds at the order of @xmath82@xmath16s for gravitino masses below the @xmath27 and @xmath24 thresholds . for masses above 200@xmath16gev , the tau neutrino channel starts to compete in sensitivity with the photon channel , if we neglect for the moment the difficulties connected with measuring such a low flux and identifying the neutrino flavour . at even higher energies the background flux decreases quickly and therefore the signal - to - background ratio improves , but the signal rate then also decreases ( as @xmath83 ) , making detection more difficult .      the prospects for hyper - kamiokande can be easily obtained by considering that its mass is planned to be a factor of 10 ( for the 0.5 megaton project ) to 20 ( for a 1 megaton case ) larger than super - kamiokande . assuming that the rest of the detector performances are unchanged , we expect to find approximately 2040 events from our signal per century from the upper hemisphere . the total volume as it is in super - kamiokande . ]",

    "of course , the effective area depends on the neutrino energy : taking the effective area given in  @xcite for the opposite direction and assuming most of the signal is above 100@xmath16gev , we have instead @xmath86 events per year . in general , it would be desirable to lower the energy threshold to reach below 100@xmath16gev in order to cover the energy range favoured by the egret and heat anomalies .",

    "such a configuration could probably also be useful for investigating the present scenario and , more generally , other decaying dark matter candidates .",

    "on one side , present neutrino detectors do not achieve a sufficiently high energy resolution to resolve the subdominant peaks , and on the other side , the event rate is expected to be so small that the background of atmospheric neutrinos overwhelms the signal in all flavours . the most promising signal - to - background ratio is found in the tau neutrino flavour , especially when analysing only the flux from the upper hemisphere since there the atmospheric tau neutrino flux is vastly reduced .",
    "however , tau neutrinos are difficult to identify in cherenkov detectors and probably only an event - by - event identification procedure could allow the signal to be seen with such extremely limited statistics . at present , therefore , it is not possible to detect this contribution due to technological limitations",

    "<S> the gravitino is a promising supersymmetric dark matter candidate which does not require exact @xmath0-parity conservation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even with some small @xmath0-parity breaking , gravitinos are sufficiently long - lived to constitute the dark matter of the universe , while yielding a cosmological scenario consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis and the high reheating temperature required for thermal leptogenesis . in this paper , we compute the neutrino flux from direct gravitino decay and gauge boson fragmentation in a simple scenario with bilinear @xmath0-parity breaking . </S>",
    "<S> our choice of parameters is motivated by a proposed interpretation of anomalies in the extragalactic gamma - ray spectrum and the positron fraction in terms of gravitino dark matter decay . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the generated neutrino flux is compatible with present measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possibility of detecting these neutrinos in present and future experiments and conclude that it is a challenging task . </S>",
