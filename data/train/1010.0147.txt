    "because of this , dispersion interaction between hydrogen atoms ( molecules ) and a graphite sheet ( graphene ) or single - walled carbon nanotubes was investigated mainly by using the phenomenological density functional theory @xcite .",

    "the application of the lifshitz theory of dispersion interaction to one - atom - thick carbon nanostructures calls for introduction of some other quantity which determines the reflection coefficients instead of usually used dielectric permittivity . in order to extend the lifshitz theory to the case of carbon systems ,",

    "as a consequence , at low energies the dispersion relation for quasiparticles in graphene is approximately linear with respect to the momentum measured relatively to the corners of the graphene brillouin zone . under the assumption that these properties , which are referred to as the dirac model , hold at any energy , the reflection coefficients for the electromagnetic oscillations on graphene were found @xcite .",

    "if the two models of graphene ( the hydrodynamic one and the dirac one ) lead to the values of interaction energy which differ dramatically , it might be possible to experimentally exclude some model or find it consistent with the data . to make reflection amplitudes more pronounced it is customary in experiments on quantum reflection to use atoms with large static electric polarizability .",

    "<S> the van der waals and casimir - polder interaction of different atoms with graphene is investigated using the dirac model which assumes that the energy of quasiparticles is linear with respect to the momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results for the van der waals coefficients of hydrogen atoms and molecules and atoms of metastable he@xmath0 and na as a function of separation are compared with respective results found using the hydrodynamic model of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , regardless of the value of the gap parameter , the dirac model leads to much smaller values of the van der waals coefficients than the hydrodynamic model . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment on quantum reflection of metastable he@xmath0 and na atoms on graphene is proposed which is capable to discriminate between the two models of the electronic structure of graphene . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the phenomenological potential for both these atoms interacting with graphene described by different models are determined . </S>"
