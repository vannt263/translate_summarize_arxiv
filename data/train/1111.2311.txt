    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite is well known to be the main practical application of the fundamental principles of quantum physics on the single quanta level and is the core part of quantum information processing .",
    "it has its goal in establishing communication channels , where physical principles guarantee the security of cryptographic keys .",
    "first proposed for the single quanta ( qubits ) , it was lately developed on the basis of continuous variables ( cv ) @xcite , which are observables of either coherent @xcite or squeezed @xcite states of light .",
    "due to use of quadrature modulation and homodyne measurement the latter approach does not need single - photon sources and detectors . in a typical cv qkd scenario ,",
    "one of the trusted parties ( alice ) performs displacement of a carrier state by modulating it in one or both of complementary quadratures .",
    "states are sent thought the channel , that is assumed to be fully under the control of a potential eavesdropper ( eve ) and are then detected by the remote trusted party ( bob ) , which randomly measures one of the quadratures using a homodyne detector ( or simultaneously both quadratures using a pair of the homodyne detectors in the balanced heterodyne scenario @xcite ) . after transmitting a sufficient number of bits ,",
    "parties exchange classical information and apply classical algorithms to perform reconciliation , which includes discretization of gaussian data and error correction and results in identical bit strings , from which the secure key is distilled using classical privacy amplification algorithms .",
    "the unconditional security of the cv qkd protocols was proven for the general case of collective attacks @xcite ( which implies security against the most general coherent attacks @xcite ) using extremality of gaussian states @xcite as such that provide maximum information to an eavesdropper .",
    "the lower bound on the unconditionally secure key rate in a generic direct and reverse reconciliation ( dr and rr respectively ) gaussian cv qkd protocol has the form @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mutual information between trusted parties , holevo quantity @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the upper bound on information , which can be available to an eavesdropper under the collective attacks scenario , and @xmath4 is the reconciliation efficiency , which characterizes , how effectively trusted parties process the data .",
    "the security of a scheme is established as the positivity of the lower bound ( [ generic ] ) in either reconciliation scenario .",
    "the successful experimental demonstrations of the cv qkd were performed @xcite , but two serious limitations were revealed .",
    "first , the dr scenario was remarkably shown to be unable to provide security under channel losses higher than @xmath5 @xcite ( the limitation , which can be overcome by the use of either post - selection @xcite or the rr scheme @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , existing reconciliation algorithms suffer from low efficiency ( the effect , also known in the discrete - variable qkd @xcite ) , especially under rr and high level of loss @xcite . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "the discrete modulation of coherent states @xcite can be used .",
    "alternatively , it might be expected , that squeezing can qualitatively help when the reconciliation efficiency is limited and thus lowers @xmath1 . since the analysis of dr and rr squeezed state protocol upon limited @xmath4 has not been carried out in @xcite and squeezing was not distinguished from high modulation , it is not clear how much we gain from the feasible amount of squeezing .    in this paper , we predict that feasible limited squeezing is sufficient to reach evident tolerance to the channel noise for the long - distance quantum channels when the signal - to - noise ratio and , accordingly , reconciliation efficiency are low . to prove it , we have modified the entanglement - based scheme @xcite to be able to distinguish between the resources by independently varying squeezing and displacement in the state preparation .",
    "thus we compare squeezed - state and coherent - state gaussian protocols with optimal displacement under conditions of the same low reconciliation efficiency .",
    "we show the linear improvement of the security region by squeezing , which results in the fact that even limited squeezing can provide robustness to noise about an order of magnitude higher than is tolerable by coherent states .",
    "the result principally opens an experimentally feasible gaussian - modulation alternative to the discrete modulation protocols , recently proposed for the same purpose of overcoming limited reconciliation .",
    "we verify the security of squeezed and coherent states in the conditions of an untrusted channel with transmittance @xmath6 and excess noise @xmath7 .",
    "since we estimate the maximum performance of a state in the gaussian cv qkd , we assume that the state preparation is noiseless . at the same time",
    "we follow the pessimistic scenario and consider all the noise , observed by the remote party , as untrusted ( it can be both channel and untrusted detector noise ) .",
    "we consider the displacement and measurement of quadrature observables of a light mode , which can be introduced as linear combination of anihilation and creation operators of the given mode as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "under such a definition the quadrature fluctuations of a vacuum or coherent state mode will be equal to @xmath10 , which we refer to as the shot - noise unit ( snu ) .    to access both displacement and squeezing independently in the conditions of noisy channel we perform calculations modeling the general prepare - and - measure scheme ( see figure [ scheme_general ] ( a ) ) by the equivalent entanglement - based ( epr ) scheme ( figure [ scheme_general ] ( b ) ) representing a slightly modified version of the original scheme from @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the source is constructed by coupling two differently oppositely squeezed modes , while the measurement of alice is carried out as heterodyne with the second input of the beam splitter fed by a squeezed vacuum with the squeezing direction being the same as measured by alice . with varying the squeezing value , either coherent or squeezed state is conditionally prepared in bob s mode .",
    "the correspondence between the modified epr - based scheme and the generalized preparation scheme in terms of variances reads @xmath11 @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are variances of , respectively , amplitude and phase quadrature displacement , and @xmath15 is squeezed variance in the prepare - and - measure scheme ; @xmath16 is squeezed and @xmath17 is anti - squeezed variance of the states , used to construct the entangled state , and @xmath18 is the squeezed variance of the state put to the free port of a heterodyne detector at alice side in the epr - based scheme .",
    "the mutual shannon information between parties is the same for both dr and rr scenarios and is calculated using variances and conditional variances of the respective mode quadratures as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the variance of alice s mode , @xmath21 is bob s mode variance after the channel , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the correlation between alice and bob , so that    @xmath24    ( similarly for @xmath25 ) . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath26-quadrature is squeezed in the prepare - and - measure scenario and is , accodringly , measured by alice in the entanglement - based scheme . in the case , when the squeezing direction is orthogonally rotated , the results for the squeezing and measurement of @xmath27-quadrature are directly accesible by transitions @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in terms of the prepare - and - measure generalized scheme ,",
    "the mutual information between the trusted parties reads : @xmath31},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 corresponds to homodyne detection and @xmath33 to heterodyne ( note that obtaining classical information from the measurements of anti - squeezed quadrature is ineffective , unless the state is close to coherent ) .",
    "however , in the following exposition we consider only homodyne measurement .",
    "the reason for this is that heterodyne , being advantageous under rr and disadvantageous under dr , can be regarded as the particular case of `` fighting noise with noise '' @xcite when trusted noise at the bob side decouples eve from the measurement results .",
    "this effect is practically independent of squeezing ( being valid also for coherent sates if bases are switched ) and does not change the results below , which reveal the role of limited squeezing in cv qkd .",
    "as was mentioned , eve s information under the assumption of collective eavesdropping strategy is upper limited by the holevo quantity @xmath2 ( @xmath3 upon rr ) .",
    "the holevo quantity can be written as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the von neumann entropy of the eavesdropper state @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is the von neumann entropy of the eavesdropper state @xmath38 conditioned by the reference side measurement result @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the distribution of the measured results . in case of gaussian modulation of the coherent or squeezed states",
    "the entropy @xmath37 does not depend on alice s measurement results and the holevo quantity is expressed as @xmath41 ( similarly , @xmath42 in the reverse reconciliation scenario ) @xcite . if channel noise is present , it is assumed that in the worst - case scenario the eavesdropper can purify the state shared between the trusted parties , thus @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the entropy of the state between alice and bob , and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is calculated from the conditional two - mode state ( including alice s heterodyne mode @xmath47 ) after alice s projective measurement .",
    "similar considerations apply for the case of rr and give slightly simpler expression @xmath48 ( since alice s heterodyne measurement does not change the entropies and taking mode @xmath47 into account is not necessary ) , with the latter term being calculated from the state shared between alice and bob conditioned on bob s measurement .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath49 of the two - mode alice - bob state after heterodyne at alice is given by :    @xmath50    where source variances are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and source correlations are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the conditional matrix @xmath57 after bob s homodyne measurement in @xmath26 , which is used in the calculation of the rr scenario , is obtained ( @xcite ) as    @xmath58    where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the submatrices of @xmath49 , standing for individual modes and their correlation , @xmath62 denotes the moore - penrose pseudoinverse of a matrix and @xmath63 is the @xmath64 matrix , with elements equal to @xmath65 , except the first , which is @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting matrix @xmath57 is given by    @xmath66    the entropies then are given by the expressions @xmath67+g[(\\lambda_2 - 1)/2]$ ] and @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath69 are the symplectic eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath49 , @xmath70 is the symplectic eigenvalue of @xmath57 , and @xmath71 .",
    "similar calculations apply to the dr scenario , when @xmath46 is calculated from two symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix @xmath72 after alice s measurement in @xmath26 .    in the simplest case of a purely lossy channel",
    "the key rate can be relatively easy calculated analytically .",
    "indeed , the channel in this case can be described as a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath6 .",
    "then the state , which is available to eve for collective measurement , is the state of the second output mode of the beam splitter .",
    "the von neumann entropies , contributing to the holevo quantity , are directly calculated from two symplectic eigenvalues @xmath69 of the two @xmath73 covariance matrices , describing eve s mode state @xmath36 before and @xmath38 ( or @xmath74 depending on reconciliation direction ) after the respective trusted party measurement ( calculated similarly to ( [ condmat ] ) ) , resulting in @xmath75-g[(\\lambda_2 - 1)/2]$ ] .",
    "the symplectic eigenvalues are then the square roots of covariance matrix determinants , which , since matrices are diagonal , are the products of matrix elements , and , in the more relevant case of reverse reconciliation , read :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the correlation between bob s and eve s modes in @xmath78 quadrature ( note , that similar calculations apply to the measurement of @xmath27 quadrature ) . taking into account the expressions for mode variances , after straightforward calculations these symplectic eigenvalues directly give expression for the holevo quantity , and , being combined with mutual information ( [ mi ] ) lead to the analytical expression for the lower bound on the key rate ( [ generic ] ) under pure channel loss .    in the presence of channel noise",
    "the calculations were performed semianalytically with numerical estimations in the general case and analytical expressions in the limiting cases .",
    "further we estimate the key rate and establish the security bounds in terms of the tolerable channel noise , which is the main objective limitation for security of the protocols , since any loss can be tolerated upon the rr .",
    "while in @xcite the reconciliation efficiency is perfect , we focus here on limited reconciliation efficiency . this must be taken into account , since it turns out to be one of the main practical limiting factors for the gaussian cv qkd , especially if rr is used . in particular ,",
    "the efficiency @xmath79 was reached in the recent experimental implementation of the gaussian cv qkd with coherent states and rr @xcite , and thus the scheme was limited by the 25 km distance ( corresponding to transmittance @xmath80 ) , while displacement had to be optimized .",
    "although reconciliation efficiency can be relatively high in the case of dr , we start from this scenario .",
    "first , on figure [ krvssigma ] ( left ) we show how the secure key rate depends on displacement variance for different values of squeezing and reconciliation efficiency .",
    "it is evident from the plots that even moderate squeezing ( @xmath5 ) quantitatively improves the key rate , while displacement variance must be optimized .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the reason for this effect is in the behavior of the holevo quantity @xmath81 , describing the upper bound on the quantum information , available to an eavesdropper .",
    "indeed , for low @xmath4 the contribution of mutual information to the lower bound ( [ generic ] ) becomes very low ; in addition , for low channel transmittances @xmath82 the mutual information practically does not depend on squeezing as @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "thus , the question is : which kind of states is more effectively minimizing the holevo quantity ?",
    "although the holevo quantity is the entropic measure of maximum information , available to an eavesdropper , its minimization has direct physicsl meaning .    for the purely lossy channels the holevo quantity is minimized with the value @xmath65 , which is reached when the two parts of the quantity @xmath42 ( calculated from eve s state and eve s state conditioned by bob s measurement ) are equal . from expressions ( [ lambda1pureloss ] ) and ( [ lambda2pureloss ] ) for symplectic eigenvalues , which are used to calculate both parts @xmath35 and @xmath84 of the holevo quantity , it is evident that the eigenvalues ( and , accordingly , the two parts of the holevo quantity ) are equal when correlation between bob and eve is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "it is achieved , regardless of channel transmittance , when @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 , where @xmath15 is the squeezed state variance in the prepare - and - measure scheme .",
    "the typical profile of @xmath81 is given at figure [ krrrandholevo ] ( right ) versus signal state squeezing and displacement variance upon purely lossy channel .    in case",
    "when channel noise is present , the holevo quantity is minimized upon the same value of modulation ( the minimum value being positive , i.e. the typical plot of the holevo quantity , given in figure [ krrrandholevo ] , is moved up by the channel noise equivalently for any squeezing and modulation ) .",
    "it was confirmed numerically using the purification method , but can also be obtained from analytical considerations if entangling cloner attack is considered .",
    "such an attack was shown to be the optimal individual attack @xcite and was recently used to calculate security against collective attacks @xcite . under entangling cloner attack the correlation between bob and eve s cloner mode is again directly accessible , it is @xmath87 , where @xmath7 is the channel noise .",
    "again , this correlation is minimized upon @xmath88 being equal to @xmath10 .    thus , the minimum of the holevo quantity , i.e. the minimization of the upper bound on information , available to eve , which is relevant in the low @xmath4 regime upon rr , is achieved upon complete ( for pure channel loss ) or maximum possible decoupling of eve from bob , when the correlation between their modes is minimized .",
    "it depends solely on the state properties before channel and is described by the simple condition @xmath86 .",
    "evidently , squeezed states reach this de - correlation upon positive displacement variance , while coherent states minimize the holevo quantity only when no displacement is applied . moreover , in case when the reconciliation efficiency is arbitrarily small ( i.e. @xmath89 ) the security can be achieved only for @xmath90 , which is evidently 0 for gaussian modulated coherent states , i.e. no information can be added to coherent states by displacement , when reconciliation efficiency @xmath4 is low .",
    "at the same time even small squeezing of quantum states allows additional displacement and is thus able to carry information , contributing to the secure key .",
    "thereby , the case of low reconciliation efficiency represents the essentially nonclassical region of qkd , where squeezing plays the main role , whereas the contribution from the classical resources is minor . from this",
    "follows that nonclassical resource , namely squeezing , can partly substitute the limited classical reconciliation resource .",
    "we have analyzed the role of squeezing in the continuous - variable quantum key distribution , clearly distinguishing squeezing from displacement in a generalized preparation scheme , taking into account imperfect reconciliation .",
    "we have shown that squeezing improves tolerance to untrusted noise in both direct and reverse reconciliation schemes and is strictly required in the direct case when reconciliation efficiency is low . for highly attenuating channels , corresponding to long - distance links , squeezing demonstrates linear improvement of the security region in terms of tolerable untrusted noise under optimized displacement .",
    "hereby , even limitedly squeezed states can provide security in the conditions of a strongly attenuating channel and in the presence of untrusted noise , contrary to coherent states , which fail to demonstrate any non - negligible tolerance to noise under the same low reconciliation efficiency .",
    "the reason for the effect is the behavior of the holevo quantity , upper bounding the eavesdropper s information .",
    "it turns out to be more effectively minimized by the squeezed states , i.e. under higher displacement , applied to the states .",
    "thus , under low reconciliation efficiency , both direct and reverse gaussian protocols enter essentially the nonclassical regime , when tolerance to the noticeable channel noise can be provided only by squeezed states .",
    "weak gaussian modulation of moderately squeezed states in the reverse scenario can be a feasible alternative to the discrete modulation of coherent states for the long - distance links .",
    "however , the most effective solution will probably be the combination of the two approaches with optimization of both modulation scheme and quantum state as the resource .",
