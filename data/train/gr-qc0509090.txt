    "general relativity is commonly regarded as the correct approach to non - quantum gravitation @xcite .",
    "einstein s theory views gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of the @xmath0-d space - time @xcite .",
    "several authors have proposed to consider this physical curved @xmath0-d space - time as a membrane embedded in a flat space - time of higher dimension called the host space .",
    "this point of view is computationally convenient and is also extremely natural in the context of modern string and brane theory @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present article is to complement the existing literature on this topic .",
    "our main conclusion is that the embedding approach to gr can be successfully implemented in a large variety of contexts and provides some undeniable computational and conceptual advantages .",
    "here follows a summary of our principal results .",
    "we first introduce two new classes of embeddings ( modeled after nash s classical free embeddings @xcite ) and explain why these two classes are particularly natural from the physical point of view . although they typically require host spaces of higher dimensions than most embeddings proposed by various authors @xcite , these new classes of embeddings present the important physical advantage of being deformable , and therefore physically more realistic .",
    "in particular , given an arbitrary space - time , any embedding of this space - time which belongs to one of the two new classes can be deformed to obtain an embedding for gravitational waves propagating in this space - time .",
    "we then give explicit examples of embeddings in both classes for the standard minkovski space - time , the schwarzschild black hole and gravitational waves propagating in flat space - time .",
    "we then propose new variational principles which give back einstein s general relativity by viewing the 4-d space - time as a membrane moving in a flat host space .",
    "some of the variational principles involve new border terms previously not considered by previous authors .",
    "actually , the issue of constructing actions which deliver the equations of standard general relativity in terms of embedding functions has been often addressed in the literature .",
    "our work is the first to propose a solution to this long standing problem .",
    "we finally show that the embedding point of view permits a particularly simple and physically enlightening treatment of the initial value problem in relativistic gravitation .",
    "we denote the physical 4-d space - time by @xmath1 and its lorenztian , possibly curved metric by @xmath2 .",
    "space - time indices running from @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) to @xmath5 will be indicated by greek ( latin ) letters and the metric signature will be @xmath6 .",
    "the covariant derivative for tensor fields defined on @xmath1 is , as usual , the derivative operator associated with the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath2 .",
    "we also consider a ` host'-space @xmath7 _ i.e. _ an @xmath8-dimensional lorentzian flat space with metric @xmath9 and choose a system of @xmath8 coordinates @xmath10 in the host - space @xmath11 .    to view the physical 4-d space - time as embedded in the host - space",
    "is tantamount to saying that an arbitrary point @xmath12 in @xmath1 can be considered as a point of @xmath11 as well .",
    "we thus define an embedding by a set of @xmath8 functions @xmath13 , @xmath14 , which represent the @xmath15-coordinates of the space - time point @xmath12 .",
    "note that these functions are scalars with respect to coordinate changes on the space - time @xmath1 .",
    "let us now choose a system of four coordinates @xmath16 on the physical space - time @xmath1 .",
    "the squared line element @xmath17 between two infinitesimal points of @xmath1 reads , with obvious notations : @xmath18 but the same squared line element can also be evaluated by viewing both points as belonging to the host - space ; this leads to @xmath19 or @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the partial differentiation of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "this partial derivative actually coincides with the covariant derivative @xmath24 of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath23 because , as noted earlier , the function @xmath22 is a scalar respect to coordinate changes on @xmath1 . equating ( [ eq : ds21 ] ) and ( [ eq : ds22 ] ) delivers the important relation : @xmath25 which is manifestly covariant with respect to coordinate changes on @xmath1 .",
    "it is a well known result that a given lorentzian ( or riemannian ) metric manifold can be embedded into a flat host space of higher dimension .",
    "constructive and existence theorems in the local @xcite as well as in the global sense give conditions on the minimal dimension of the host space , for closed and open manifolds ( see also @xcite , and the references in the review @xcite ) .",
    "the minimal dimension of the host - space needed to embed locally a generical 4-dimensional space - time is @xmath26 .",
    "usually less dimensions are needed for vacuum space - times @xcite .",
    "it has however been argued heuristically by deser _",
    "_ @xcite that embeddings can not _ a priori _ be used with profit by physicists .",
    "this conclusion essentially rests on an intuition gained from studying the so - called trivial embedding of @xmath0-d minkovski space - time into itself , which can not be deformed to accomodate standard gravitational waves .",
    "the way out of this possible problem is conceptually extremely simple .",
    "it consists in working only with particular embeddings which do admit deformations .",
    "this is where the notion of freeness enters the picture .",
    "put simply , free , @xmath27-free and spatially free embeddings are three particular classes of embeddings which share the common property of being _ by definition _ deformable to accommodate linear variations of the metric tensor .",
    "let us now present the technicalities which motivate the three definitions we are about to give .",
    "consider a given embedding of the form ( [ embed1 ] ) and let @xmath28 be an arbitrary perturbation or deformation of this embedding .",
    "we assume that the vectors @xmath29 of the host space are linearly independent .",
    "note that this condition is necessary for the metric to be invertible , since from eq.([embed1 ] ) , the linear dependence of these vectors would imply directly the existence of a nonzero eigenvector of the metric matrix @xmath30 with zero eigenvalue .    varying ( [ embed1 ] ) , we obtain at first order in @xmath31 : @xmath32 the embedding variation is made up of two contributions , one tangent to the 4-d space - time and the other one normal to it ; we thus write @xmath33 equation ( [ eq : deltag ] ) then becomes : @xmath34 as ( [ embed1 ] ) , ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) is manifestly covariant with respect to coordinate changes on @xmath1 . the vectors @xmath35 of the host space",
    "define the _ second fundamental form _ and are normal to the 4-d embedded space - time : @xmath36 ( see appendix [ appendix : covariant ] ) .",
    "now , the embedding @xmath37 will be useful physically if it can be deformed to accommodate an arbitrary perturbation of the metric @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the physically useful embeddings are those for which equation ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) can be solved in @xmath39 and @xmath40 for any arbitrarily given @xmath41 .",
    "let us now introduce the definitions of free , @xmath27-free and spatially @xmath27-free embeddings .",
    "* definition 1 : free embeddings . * an embedding ( [ embed1 ] ) is said to be free if , for any metric perturbation @xmath41 and any choice of tangential variation @xmath42 , the 10 equations ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) can be solved in the normal variations @xmath43 .",
    "this definition originated with nash work on embeddings of riemannian manifold and is now standard .",
    "nash actually chose to work with vanishing tangent variations and the normal variations can then be obtained by algebraic methods only ( see @xcite for a modern discussion ) .",
    "locally , the dimension of the host space of nash free embeddings must be @xmath44    the material presented in the following sections ( in particular , the various action principles discussed in section [ sec : actionprinciples ] ) makes it natural to introduce two other classes of embeddings , the @xmath27-free and spatially free embeddings .",
    "these classes have never been considered by earlier authors and we now give their definitions :    * definition 2 : @xmath27-free embeddings . * an embedding ( [ embed1 ] ) is @xmath27-free if , for an arbitrary metric perturbation , the 10 equations ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) are equivalent to : + ( i ) @xmath45 linearly independent linear combinations of ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) which can be solved in the normal variations , no matter what the tangential variations are , and + ( ii ) @xmath46 remaining equations that can be solved in the tangential variations , independently of the solution obtained in ( i ) for the normal variations .",
    "+ notice that @xmath47 because there are @xmath0 independent tangential variations and thus the number of equations in ( ii ) must lie between @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "note also that , by definition , any free embedding is automatically a @xmath48-free embedding .",
    "the host - space dimension for a @xmath27-free embedding must be @xmath49 in order to accommodate the linearly independent @xmath0-dimensional tangent space and the @xmath27-dimensional subspace of the normal space which solve the equations in ( i ) . since @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 .    * definition 3 : spatially free embeddings . * an embedding is spatially free if there exist a coordinate system @xmath52 on the 4-d space - time in which the 6 vector fields @xmath53 are linearly independent .",
    "spatially free embeddings are particularly important when working in the so - called @xmath54 formalism .",
    "they form a subclass of the @xmath27-free embeddings .",
    "indeed , let @xmath55 be a spatially free embedding and let @xmath52 be the coordinate system in which the 6 vector fields @xmath53 are linearly independent . in this coordinate system , the @xmath56 components of ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) can be solved for @xmath57 .",
    "the remaining components of ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) are the @xmath58 components ; taken together , they constitute a system of four inhomogeneous first order differential equations for the fields @xmath59 that can be solved by integration along @xmath60 thus , any spatially free embedding is at least @xmath61-free , hence @xmath27-free .",
    "the three above definitions are relevant for physics if at least some general relativistic space - times admit embeddings which are either free , @xmath27-free or spatially free .",
    "we prove in the next section that this is so by constructing explicit examples of free , @xmath27-free and spatially free embeddings for several space - times of physical interest , including a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "whether all general relativistic space - times admit embeddings in at least one of these three classes remains however an open problem .",
    "we now give explicit examples of embeddings of physically relevant space - times belonging to the classes defined in the last section .",
    "they represent thus the first examples in the literature of embeddings whose deformations can , by construction , be properly mapped to metric deformations , so that , for example , gravitational waves can be described as embedding waves .",
    "let the space - time coordinates be denoted by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are ` spatial ' coordinates .",
    "we have developed a very simple method to construct @xmath27-free embeddings for an interesting class of space - times , including the flat and schwarzschild @xmath0-dimensional space - times .",
    "the method consists in splitting the host space as a direct sum of two flat subspaces , ( i ) the ` base ' host space , with flat euclidean metric @xmath64 , and ( ii ) the ` extra ' host space , with flat lorentzian metric @xmath65 ( one and only one time - like direction ) .",
    "we will describe the contribution of each subspace to the total embedding in two steps , followed by the explicit examples .      on the base host space ,",
    "we define a ` base embedding ' @xmath66 , depending only on the spatial coordinates , with the following properties :    1 .",
    "the metric induced by @xmath67 is flat : @xmath68 2 .",
    "the @xmath69 vectors @xmath70 are linearly independent for all @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a given @xmath5-dimensional subset of @xmath73 .    among the several types of base embeddings that can be constructed we have chosen the following @xmath74-dimensional one , for its simplicity : @xmath75 where the functions @xmath76 and the parameters @xmath77 are chosen so that @xmath67 satisfies properties p1 and p2 .",
    "property p1 is ensured if there exist real functions @xmath78 such that : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath81 .",
    "property p2 is ensured if the real functions @xmath78 satisfy : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 , for @xmath85 fixed .",
    "a particular solution of the previous inequalities is @xmath86    with this solution , @xmath67 is a base embedding on @xmath87 and this embedding is not self intersecting ( _ i.e. _ for any two sets of 3 spatial coordinates @xmath88 and @xmath27 , @xmath89      it is easy to show that , by adding extra embedding functions to this base embedding , the general embedding @xmath90 satisfies automatically the following properties :    1 .   the metric induced by @xmath55 decomposes as : @xmath91 2 .",
    "the embedding @xmath92 is spatially free for @xmath71 .",
    "appropriate choices of these extra embedding functions @xmath93 generate spatially free embeddings of the flat minkovski space - time and of the schwarzschild black hole .      here , to accommodate the extra embedding , only one extra dimension ( necessarily time - like )",
    "is needed .",
    "the extra embedding function is @xmath94 .",
    "the ( @xmath95-dimensional ) host space metric is @xmath96 , and it follows from eq.([eq : splitmetric ] ) that the induced space - time metric is @xmath97 this @xmath98-dimensional embedding is @xmath61-free for @xmath99      in this case , to accommodate the extra embedding we need @xmath5 extra dimensions , one time - like and two space - like . the metric components @xmath100 of this black hole in kerr - schild coordinates do not depend explicitly on @xmath101 , and read @xcite : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 by looking at eq.([eq : splitmetric ] ) , this black - hole metric is obtained if we use the following extra embedding : @xmath105 each spatial coordinate @xmath106 ranges from @xmath107 to @xmath108 the parameter @xmath109 must satisfy @xmath110 finally , the functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 must solve the differential equations : @xmath113 they are well - behaved for all @xmath114 , even near the horizon ( @xmath115 ) . analytical expressions for the functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 can be obtained when @xmath116 figs .  [",
    "fig : bh1 ] and [ fig : bh2 ] have been constructed using these expressions .",
    "the extra embedding functions @xmath117 account for the causal structure of the black hole .",

    "[ fig : bh1 ] and [ fig : bh2 ] ( interior and exterior region , respectively ) as two - dimensional surfaces parameterized by @xmath120 these are helicoidal surfaces with a pitch @xmath121 .",
    "we remark that the interior and exterior regions are smoothly connected .",
    "the black hole metric is equal to the metric induced by the plotted surface plus the ( flat ) metric @xmath122 induced by the base embedding ( not plotted ) .",
    "the event horizon @xmath123 , denoted in both figures , is an upgoing helix subtending an angle of @xmath124 with respect to the rescaled axis @xmath125 .",
    "the interior region @xmath126 is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bh1 ] .",
    "we can see the event horizon @xmath123 as a light - like helix which is close to the vertical axis .",
    "the space - like helix @xmath127 is bounding the figure .",
    "the actual surface extends to infinity as @xmath128 subtending asymptotically an angle of @xmath124 with respect to the rescaled axis @xmath125 as @xmath129 all physical trajectories get trapped in the interior region , approaching the ` helix at infinity ' @xmath130 .",
    "this graphical interpretation is possible since the plotted surface gives the main contribution to the black hole metric in the region @xmath131 .",
    "indeed , the ( flat metric ) contribution coming from the base embedding ( not plotted ) is proportional to @xmath132 and is therefore negligible .",
    "the exterior region @xmath133 is represented in fig.[fig : bh2 ] by the spiral surface that approaches the vertical axis as @xmath134 , folding and folding indefinitely , never reaching the axis .",
    "notice that in this region , the above mentioned base embedding s contribution ( not plotted ) to the black hole metric , being proportional to @xmath132 , is much more important than the _ spatial _ contribution coming from the plotted surface , so that this exterior region plot gives only partial information about the causal structure of the black hole .",
    "let us check that the @xmath61-free embedding of flat space - time introduced in section [ firstexample ] allows for the representation of gravitational waves as embedding waves by computing explicitly the perturbation of this embedding that corresponds to the well - known @xcite plane wave : @xmath135 with @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 we solve eq.([variationmetricsplit ] ) for the embedding variations by first taking vanishing tangent variations @xmath139 .",
    "we then split the normal variations as the embedding itself : @xmath140 , where @xmath141 ; @xmath142 and @xmath143 are explicitly given by : @xmath144 and the other components are obtained by cyclic permutations of @xmath145 .",
    "the functions @xmath146 and @xmath147 were defined in section [ sec : firststep ] .",
    "the embedding waves are thus simply plane waves , modulated with some smooth functions related to this particular embedding .",
    "we have introduced in the previous sections the ( purely kinematical ) concept of free embedding , which is _ by definition _",
    "deformable to accommodate linear variations of the metric tensor , and thus gravitational waves .",
    "our next goal , therefore , is to find a * satisfactory action principle * for general relativity in terms of embedding variables , in order to obtain what we will call * ` free embedding field theory for gravity'*. this theory that requires host space dimension @xmath148 , turns out to be equivalent to gr , not only at the levels of eom but also for perturbations ( waves around the general solution ) .",
    "we then consider the * ` @xmath27-free embedding theory for gravity ' * , that allows us to reduce the minimal dimension of the host space from @xmath149 to @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we introduce a third , alternative family of action principles that depend on lagrange multipliers . the metric variations and embedding variations are independent and their relation ( eq.([embed1 ] ) )",
    "is given as an eom .",
    "these alternative theories are also shown to be equivalent to usual gr , both at the levels of eom and of perturbations ( waves around the general solution ) , provided that the embedding is @xmath27-free .",
    "let us denote the @xmath0-d space - time manifold and its @xmath5-d boundary by @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively and let @xmath8 be the dimension of the host space .",

    "finally , @xmath156 $ ] is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary .",
    "the @xmath157-boundary term is here , as usual , @xcite to cancel boundary terms that depend on the normal derivatives of @xmath158 , and allows to impose the boundary conditions @xmath159 .",
    "we thus assume from now on the vanishing boundary conditions ( v.b.c . )",
    "@xmath160 on @xmath161 .",
    "these boundary conditions explicitly read , using eq.([variationmetricsplit ] ) , @xmath162 let us consider the variation of action ( [ actionrt ] ) , in two steps .",
    "first , we obtain in the standard way @xcite @xmath163 where @xmath164 $ ] is the einstein tensor computed in terms of the embedding functions ( see appendix [ appendix : covariant ] ) and @xmath41 is the variation of the metric given in terms of the variation of the embedding functions in eq.([variationmetricsplit ] ) . next we rewrite this variation of the action explicitly in terms of the variations of the embedding functions . using the twice contracted bianchi identity @xmath165",
    "we get a boundary plus a bulk term :    @xmath166    where @xmath167 is the normal unitary 3-volume element on the boundary .",
    "the above boundary term comes from the differential dependence of the metric in terms of the embedding functions .",
    "note that it has nothing to do with the @xmath156$]-boundary term in eq.([actionrt ] ) .",
    "we assume in this section the simplest case which is that the embedding is free throughout the manifold and at its boundary . from local existence theorems , this will require the dimension of the host space to be @xmath148 . by definition of free embedding ( see section [ sssec : def ] ) , the @xmath48 @xmath8-dimensional host - space vectors @xmath168 are linearly independent .    in this simple case",
    ", we can consistently take @xmath139 throughout the manifold .",
    "the boundary conditions on the embedding functions ( [ vbc ] ) now imply , because of the freeness of the embedding , @xmath169 on the boundary .    using eq.([var - action - y ] ) , under arbitrary normal embedding variations @xmath40 in the bulk we obtain the following euler - lagrange equations : @xmath170 \\,\\bm{y } _ { ; \\mu \\nu}=0\\,\\ ] ] which , taking into account embedding freeness in the bulk , imply @xmath164 = 0,$ ] which are the standard einstein equations but written in terms of the embedding functions .",
    "it is worthwhile at this point to warn the reader against a common misinterpretation . in connection with string - like models with arbitrary @xmath8 ,",
    "the equations for the minimal hypervolume membrane , @xmath171 are correctly understood as constraints on the second fundamental form @xmath172 .",
    "but the analogy of these equations with eqs.([eomrt ] ) , with @xmath173 replacing @xmath174 leads to a widespread error : to also understand eqs.([eomrt ] ) as constraints on the second fundamental form . for free embeddings",
    "this is clearly a wrong interpretation since , as we have shown , when a free embedding solves eq.([eomrt ] ) , it follows @xmath175 in a perfectly consistent way . on the other hand , for the minimal hypervolume membrane",
    "this interpretation is correct , since if a free embedding solved the corresponding equation , then the contradictory result @xmath176 would follow .",
    "the earliest work we know on the variational principle for gravitation in terms of embedding variables is the ` gravitation @xmath177 string ' due to regge and teitelboim @xcite ( rt ) .",
    "this approach is well - known _ not _ to be equivalent to general relativity .",
    "the reason for this is as follows . by requiring isometric embedding only ,",
    "the authors set @xmath26 as the dimension of the flat host space .",
    "they use essentially the action ( [ actionrt ] ) as a starting point , and the equations of motion are again ( [ eomrt ] ) . however , in this case the equations no longer imply the einstein equations since the embedding can not be free , for the dimension of the host space is @xmath178 indeed , there are only @xmath61 independent eom .",
    "the free embedding theories introduced in the previous section are equivalent to gr but require a host space of dimension @xmath148 .",
    "the following question therefore naturally arises : ` are there embedding theories equivalent to gr , based on a host space of dimension @xmath179 ? '      in this section we consider the most challenging case , @xmath26 . in other words , is it possible to modify @xmath26 rt theory and make it equivalent to gr ?",
    "we now show that the only way to make a @xmath26 rt theory equivalent to gr is to require the embedding to be @xmath61-free together with appropriate boundary conditions on the embedding variations .    in order to be equivalent to gr , a theory should have the same number ( ten ) of independent eom . however , as pointed out by regge and teitelboim @xcite , deser _ et al .",
    "_ , pavi @xcite , and franke and tapia @xcite , it follows from @xmath180 that the second fundamental form @xmath172 has at most @xmath61 independent components ( instead of ten ) .",
    "there are therefore at most @xmath61 independent eom ( [ eomrt ] ) .",
    "note that they are _ exactly _ @xmath61 independent equations ( by definition 2 , section [ sssec : def ] ) when the embedding is @xmath61-free . what happened to the other 4 ?",
    "the answer comes from the fact that the rt boundary conditions do not allow for an arbitrary variation @xmath41 in the bulk , which is not consistent with the standard derivation of the einstein equations from the action principle ( [ actionrt ] ) ( see eq.([eq : delta action 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the possibility of having arbitrary @xmath41 in the bulk depends on the boundary conditions imposed on the embedding functions in the theory .",
    "but , as we will see below , the naive rt choice of v.b.c .  on the _ variations of embedding functions _ and their normal derivatives imposes constraints on the bulk metric variations , independently of the @xmath61-freeness property .",
    "however , an arbitrary variation @xmath181 in the bulk is allowed when the boundary conditions : ( a ) @xmath182 arbitrary and ( b ) @xmath40 given by eqs.([vbc ] ) on the boundary , are used instead of the rt v.b.c .    to give a specific example , consider variations around a @xmath26 , @xmath61-free and spatially free embedding of an open neighborhood within the flat space - time @xmath183 . here",
    "the relevant boundaries for the action principle are the space - like boundaries @xmath184 .",
    "we assume for simplicity the following property for the embedding functions : @xmath185 throughout the open neighborhood .",
    "now suppose that both @xmath186 and @xmath187 are zero on the boundaries .    following the general equations ( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) there are , in the bulk , 4 differential equations we must solve for the tangent embedding variations : @xmath188 and 6 algebraic equations for the normal embedding variations : @xmath189 the last 6 equations imply @xmath190 on the boundaries , with no condition in the bulk . however , the first 4 equations give constraints : the @xmath191 component implies @xmath192 and the @xmath193 components imply @xmath194 but these expressions are zero for the v.b.c .  on the embedding variations ,",
    "so we obtain @xmath195 @xmath196 + conversely ( see eqs .",
    "( [ variationmetricsplit ] ) ) , the assumption of arbitrary metric variations in the bulk imply that , at space - like portions of the boundary , all the @xmath0 embedding tangent variations @xmath197 must be arbitrary . recalling that the action variation ( [ var - action - y ] ) depends on these tangent variations , we are led to @xmath0 extra euler - lagrange equations on the boundary , that will turn out to be the usual constraints of gr , see eq.([rteulerlagrboundary ] ) below .",
    "we now turn to the proof that , in the more general case of curved space - times embedded in a spatially free manner , these extra equations will be enough to show the equivalence of the einstein equations with the euler - lagrange equations obtained from the action ( [ actionrt ] ) under the new boundary conditions : @xmath182 arbitrary and @xmath40 given by eqs.([vbc ] ) , which admit solutions because of spatial freeness . for simplicity , we will assume the following properties for the space - time and the embedding : ( i ) the space - time is globally hyperbolic , which allows to define a global time coordinate , and ( ii ) the embedding is @xmath61-free and , with respect to the latter time coordinate , it is spatially free ( see definition 3 in section [ sssec : def ] ) .",
    "we define the resulting theory as a @xmath61-free embedding theory of gravity .    using the general equation ( [ var - action - y ] ) for the variation of the action",
    ", we consider arbitrary variations @xmath197 on the boundary , and arbitrary variations @xmath40 in the bulk .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for this theory are thus : @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the unit normal to the boundary , and @xmath200 using the appropriate time slicing , which exists in globally hyperbolic space - times , the euler - lagrange equations at the space - like boundary are @xmath201 . on the other hand ,",
    "spatial freeness of the @xmath48-dimensional embedding implies the relations @xmath202 , where @xmath203 are tensor fields defined by the embedding .",

    "in this section we discuss the possibility of treating the einstein equations as a dynamical system in terms of the embedding functions .",
    "we present some preliminary results regarding the initial value formulation of the vacuum einstein equations in the embedding approach .",
    "note that , in the usual formulation , the numerical integration schemes suffer from instabilities ( e.g. , pure gauge modes and violation of constraints @xcite ) , which destroy their performance in finite time . in this context , the direct numerical integration of the equations in the embedding variables is certainly worth developing .",
    "another motivation for future numerical work is that it could provide information on some interesting theoretical questions .",
    "for example : is @xmath27-freeness ( or spatially free @xmath27-freeness ) kept as long as one integrates in time the evolution equations in embedding variables ?    let us assume for simplicity that the dimension of the host space is @xmath26 .",
    "let us assume that the host space has only one time - like coordinate : @xmath257 and that the space - time is globally hyperbolic .",
    "one can then introduce a coordinate system @xmath258 with @xmath259 a global time - like coordinate and @xmath260 let the initial embedding , defined by the functions @xmath261 , be @xmath61-free and spatially free with respect to this coordinate system .",
    "let @xmath262 this vector is timelike and verifes : @xmath263 where @xmath264 let @xmath265 be the components of @xmath266 in the basis @xmath267 i.e. , @xmath268 .",
    "one has @xmath269 and @xmath270 defining now the lapse function @xmath271 and the shift vector @xmath272 by @xmath273 one gets the following evolution equation for @xmath274 : @xmath275    in terms of the functions @xmath276 , the metric components read @xmath277 @xmath278 @xmath279 the condition for @xmath280 to be time - like is @xmath281    our definition of lapse and shift agrees with the standard one ( see wald @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that these functions are not dynamical and that fixing them improperly can cause problems in the numerical integration of einstein equations @xcite .",
    "because of coordinate transformation invariance , @xmath0 components of @xmath55 can be chosen as arbitrary functions of @xmath282 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 equations in ( [ yeom ] ) then fix @xmath283 once @xmath266 is known .    in this way , the evolution equations ( [ yeom ] ) allow to propagate in time the embedding functions @xmath55 provided the vector @xmath266 is known . as shown in the next section , the choice of @xmath266 as the relevant variables ` conjugate to @xmath55 ' is the natural one to deal with einstein equations .      as usual ,",
    "the vacuum einstein equations @xmath284 and @xmath285 are @xmath0 constraints on the initial data ; in the present case the initial data are the values of @xmath286 at @xmath287 .",
    "the first three equations are linear in the derivatives @xmath288 , while the last one is algebraic and quadratic in @xmath289 @xmath290 here , @xmath291 is the @xmath292inverse of @xmath293 and @xmath294 where the spatial projector @xmath295 is defined by @xmath296 the projector and the metric components appearing in eqs.([einsteinconstraints ] ) are clearly given by the initial data .",
    "let us define the ` acceleration ' @xmath297 by @xmath298    since @xmath283 have been fixed by a choice of coordinates , the time evolution of @xmath266 will be completely determined if the acceleration @xmath297 is known .",
    "its normal components are obtained ( when the embedding is spatially free ) from the vacuum einstein equations @xmath299 : @xmath300 and its tangent components satisfy : @xmath301 these expressions are obtained from straightforward manipulation of the differentiated versions of eqs.([nconstraints ] ) and eqs.([yeom ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ neom][nconstraintsderived ] ) can thus be used to propagate in time the vector @xmath266 .",
    "we have revisited the embedding approach on general relativity which views the @xmath0-d , possibly curved , physical space - time as a membrane floating in a flat host space - time of higher dimension .",
    "we have first introduced two new classes of embeddings , both based on nash notion of freeness .",
    "all embeddings in these classes are deformable and , therefore , allow for a description of gravitational waves ; explicit examples of such embeddings have been given for both minkovski space - time and the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we have also presented new variational principles which deliver general relativity as a field theory for embedding variables .",
    "einstein s dynamics thus appears as free membrane dynamics in the host space .",
    "we have finally considered the general relativistic initial value formulation in terms of embedding variables and argued that this new point of view sheds new light on this particularly difficult issue .",
    "this article proposes what is , to the best of our knowledge , the first consistent embedding approach to non quantum gravitation .",
    "previous attempts have been marred by essentially two problems .",
    "the first one concerns the possibility of deforming the embedding to accommodate for gravitational waves .",
    "our approach is the first to use the notion of freeness introduced by nash , and variations thereof , to solve this problem .",
    "the second problem is linked with the possibility of constructing an action principle which would deliver einstein s theory in terms of the embedding variables .",
    "previous attempts failed in this respect because the action functionals were used with the wrong boundary conditions , and also because the considered embeddings were not free .",
    "we have constructed explicitly free embeddings of several general relativistic space - times of astrophysical importance ( for example , a schwarzschild black hole ) .",
    "the approach developed in this article is thus relevant to physics .",
    "whether all general relativistic space - times can be embedded freely in a flat space - time of higher dimension remains however an open question .",
    "we would like to end this article by mentioning a few assets offered by the embedding point of view on gr which have not already been discussed .",
    "first , the embedding point of view is remarkably modern , offering obvious links with string theory , m - theory ( or f - theory ) and cosmology ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , embedding variables seem ideally suited to the semiclassical study of the spontaneous creation or destruction of universes out of a quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "more generally , the embedding point of view surely appears as _ the _ right tool to study problems involving changes in the topology of space - time .",
    "in fact , in our example of flat space - time , the extra parameters and functions ( appearing explicitly in the embedding but not in the metric ) can be chosen in order to change the topology of space - time from @xmath183 to @xmath302 . in this context , the problem of averaging statistically the geometry of ( classical ) space - time has recently been solved for situations in which the topology of space - time is fixed @xcite . does the embedding point of view permit a more general treatment ?    finally , it is certainly interesting to investigate how field quantization on the ( flat ) host space translates on the embedded space - time .",
    "the free embedding theory of gravity introduced in this paper , precisely because it deals with @xmath27-free embeddings , is suitable for perturbative quantum theory , as opposed to the old approaches ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to cite just a few interesting questions : does the resulting 4-d quantum theory depend , at fixed space - time coordinates @xmath303 , on the choice of the embedding ?",
    "we refer the reader to discussions of this topic in the context of rt theory , and in the context of embedding theory of induced gravity in @xcite .",
    "what new insight does the embedding point of view bring to the unruh effect @xcite ? and how does black hole thermodynamics appear in the embedding point of view ? ( see @xcite for an account of these two last topics in the context of gr ) .",
    "following dirac @xcite we define the christoffel symbols in terms of the embedding functions : @xmath304 the covariant derivative is defined as usual in terms of the christoffel symbols .",
    "for example , the second covariant derivative of a scalar function @xmath305 is @xmath306 it is interesting to see that , when @xmath307 is replaced by the embedding functions ( which are scalars by definition ) we get what is known as the second fundamental form : @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the normal projector , whose kernel is by definition the tangent space @xmath310 generated by the tangent vectors @xmath311 then , the second fundamental form is a set of vectors in the normal space ( @xmath312 ) with @xmath313    finally we compute the riemann and einstein tensors in terms of the embedding functions .",
    "the riemann curvature tensor depends on second ( partial ) derivatives of the metric tensor , which itself depends on first derivatives of the embedding functions .",
    "therefore one could naively expects the curvature tensor to depend on third order derivatives of the embedding functions .",
    "however , all terms containing third order derivatives vanish .",
    "the riemann tensor thus depends on second derivatives only and reads @xmath314 the einstein tensor is similarly written @xmath315.$ ]    geometrically , it is natural that only second covariant derivatives of embedding functions appear in these tensors : the curvature radii of the embedded manifold along the principal axes depend essentially on the _ normal _ components of the matrix of second derivatives of the embedding functions ( the second fundamental form ) ."
