    "eukaryotic cell crawling has attracted much attention recently from the view point of nonlinear science and non - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "one of the characteristic features is that the symmetry is spontaneously broken to cause the front - rear asymmetry when the cell migrates in contrast to bacterias which swim by rotary motion of flagella and hence are inherently asymmetric .",
    "the dynamics of eukaryotic cells involves the mechanical forces between cell membrane and substrate , and biochemical reaction of active molecules inside a cell .",

    "[ linear](a ) looks like a brownian motion , the center - of - mass motion and the shape change are not totally independent of each other because of the relations ( [ vpai ] ) and ( [ thetapai ] ) .",

    "[ linear](b ) that , in the linear case , @xmath40 exhibits a time - variation similar to @xmath198 but there is no apparent correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath197 .",
    "in contrast , these three angles change in an almost synchronized manner in the nonlinear case as can be seen in fig . [ nonlinear](b ) .",
    "note that the variation of @xmath40 is in the range of @xmath215 ( modulus @xmath216 ) so that the trajectory is curved substantially in the linear case whereas it is smaller in the nonlinear case as @xmath217 ( modulus @xmath216 ) so that the trajectory does not exhibits much wandering .",
    "the migration velocity is determined by the amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 as eq .",
    "( [ vpai ] ) .",
    "note that the magnitude of the migration velocity is not much different between the linear and nonlinear cases .",
    "therefore , the longer persistence length in the nonlinear case is not due to velocity difference .",
    "the two deformations @xmath87 and @xmath88 take a maximum almost simultaneously in the linear case as in fig .",
    "[ linear](c ) because of the time - dependence of the forces as shown in fig .",
    "[ wzt ] . in the nonlinear case depicted in fig .",
    "[ nonlinear](c ) , the amplitude @xmath87 becomes maximum with a slightly delay compared with @xmath88 .",
    "the value of @xmath88 is much smaller than that of @xmath87 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ eqs22noise ] ) has a plus sign but that in eq .",
    "( [ eqs32noise ] ) has a minus sign for @xmath59 .",
    "the magnitude of fluctuations of @xmath199 indicates an interesting time - variation as shown in figs .",
    "[ linear](c ) and [ nonlinear](c ) . in the linear case",
    ", it becomes large just at the instance that the velocity ( and @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) starts increasing . in the time region when these quantities are decreasing , the fluctuations of @xmath199 are also small .",
    "the main reason of this is due to the multiplicative noises for the angles in eqs .",
    "( [ eqtheta23noise ] ) and ( [ eqtheta33noise ] ) .",
    "because of a delay in the evolutions of the deformations @xmath87 and @xmath88 relative to the deformation forces , the cell is not deformed substantially even when the forces are large and vice verse in the linear case . in the nonlinear case ,",
    "@xmath199 fluctuates strongly during the growth of the velocity whereas appreciable decrease in fluctuations is not seen in the decreasing of the velocity since the nonlinearity masks the multiplicative effect of noises .    we have assumed in this section that the origin of the deformation forces is excitability .",
    "the case of oscillating deformation forces will be described shortly in the next section .    before closing this section",
    ", we compare our results with experiments of @xmath0 cells in a vegetative condition @xcite to check the consistency of the characteristic space - time scale .",
    "the characteristic period of the force moments is about @xmath218  minutes . the migration ( end - to - end ) distance is about @xmath219 m during 15 minutes .",
    "since the diameter of a cell is about @xmath220 m , this means that a cell migrates roughly the distance of one cell size in two cycles of deformations . on the other hand ,",
    "the average period of the deformation force in our model has been set about 15 in the unit of @xmath121 .",
    "figure  [ linear](a ) displays the trajectory for the duration time 175 ( about 11 cycles ) during which the cell migrates at the distance about 10 ( end - to - end distance ) .",
    "since the radius is set as @xmath221 , that is , the diameter is equal to 2 , this is qualitatively consistent with the experiments .",
    "we have proposed a model system for cell crawling which is a set of nonlinear equations for deformations coupled through the migration velocity .",
    "we have introduced random noises for the time - evolution equations of deformations but not for the equation of the migration velocity since our basic assumption is that the internal forces cause crawling . when the deformation forces are constant , we have found that the model has a limit cycle solution .",
    "this oscillatory behavior is compared qualitatively with that in the phase field model coupled with the polarization field for keratocyte cells @xcite .    in the case of time - dependent forces , they are generated by the coherence resonance . as a result ,",
    "the deformations @xmath87 and @xmath88 exhibit a steep change in time . because of the noise term @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) , the velocity @xmath116 and the phases @xmath197 and @xmath198 as well as @xmath87 and @xmath88 are stochastic . however , this stochasticity is not strong enough to make a random motion like in fig .",
    "[ linear](a ) .",
    "therefore we have introduced another set of random noises @xmath222 and @xmath223 as eqs .",
    "( [ f11 ] ) - ( [ f222 ] ) in the time - evolution equations .",
    "this is a technical point in the present theory .",
    "we do not claim that two different kinds of noises are involved in the motility of real living cells .    for milder time - dependence",

    ". the results both for the linear case and the nonlinear case are not much different qualitatively from those in the excitable deformation forces shown in the preceding section . by utilizing the oscillatory deformation forces in the present model , the motility of human hematopoietic stem cells is now under investigation @xcite .",
    "we have emphasized that the phase difference of the deformation forces and the relative angle of the dynamical variables are crucial to compare our model with experiments .",
    "for example , we have chosen @xmath75 throughout the present paper .",
    "anti - phase oscillation of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the constant deformation forces seems to be consistent with the motility of keratocyte obtained theoretically @xcite as shown in section 3 . in section 4 , the time - dependence of the deformation forces are chosen such that the value of @xmath232 moves counter - clockwise as shown in fig .",

    "it is mentioned here briefly that what happens if one uses the relations ( [ theta11])-([theta14 ] ) . in this case , equations for the amplitudes and the phases of deformations are given by @xmath234 for the sake of clarity , we have written down the equations for the linear case without noises .",
    "if one sets @xmath75 , the stationary solution of the amplitude @xmath88 turns out to be negative since @xmath17 and @xmath36 are assumed to be positive . if @xmath235 , i.e. , @xmath57 , this difficulty is removed , but in this case , the cell takes the same shape as in fig .",
    "[ shapenonoise ] , but migrates from the left to the right with the @xmath87 deformation followed by the @xmath88 deformation .",
    "such a motion , however , has not been observed experimentally in @xmath0 cells .",
    "see , e.g. , ref . @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the correlation between the deformations and the migration velocity plays an important role in the cell crawling .",
    "first of all , it is noted that the relation ( [ thetapai ] ) causes a correlation between them even when the nonlinear coupling is absent .",
    "secondly , when the nonlinearity is present , the motion becomes more persistent .",
    "that is , the cell tends to migrate without large changes of the direction although the intensity of the random noises is the same as in the linear case .",
    "we note that maeda et al have observed a similar dynamics experimentally in @xmath0 cells @xcite .",
    "they have made a systematic comparison of the motility in a starved condition and a vegetative condition .",
    "a cell in a starved condition migrates at a larger velocity and elongates in the direction parallel to the migration direction .",
    "its trajectory is much more persistent than in a vegetative condition . in the present analysis",
    ", we have changed the coefficients of the nonlinear terms to compare the linear and nonlinear cases explicitly .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that the nonlinear effects are enhanced for larger migration velocity by increasing @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ vpai ] ) keeping other parameters fixed .",
    "it is an interesting future problem to elucidate further both theoretically and experimentally the difference of the dynamical behavior between the starved and vegetative conditions .    in the present study , we have considered only the second and third mode deformations assuming that higher modes relax sufficiently rapidly and the forces acting on them are weaker .",
    "preliminary numerical investigations have been carried out by including the fourth mode with the relaxation constant comparable with those of the second and third modes . in this case , as mentioned at the end of section 3 , circular motions appear for time - independent forces in the absence of noises . on the other hand , when the forces of the fourth mode are time - dependent as eqs .",
    "( [ g2tmodify ] ) and ( [ g3tmodify ] ) , spinning motion , quasi - periodic motion and chaotic motion have been found .",
    "we do not go into detail here but will publish these results separately elsewhere .",
    "obviously , a remaining problem is to derive the time - evolution equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) , and ( [ eq3 ] ) starting either from the phase field model of cell crawling , which involves the traction force explicitly @xcite or from the model of active droplets subjected to active stress @xcite by means of the reduction theory as was done for traveling domains in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite and for hydrodynamic droplets self - propelled by the marangoni effect @xcite .",
