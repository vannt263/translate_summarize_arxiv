    "recently the problem of the formation and detection of majorana fermions has drawn a lot of attention.@xcite the formation of majorana states has been predicted by many theoretical works @xcite .",
    "one of the systems predicted to exhibit majorana fermions is a one - dimensional semiconducting wire with strong spin - orbit coupling such as insb@xcite or inas@xcite , in the proximity of an superconducting substrate , and in the presence of a zeeman magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , an unambiguous experimental detection of majorana fermions remains unattained despite many promising experiments @xcite .    in the quest to find an unequivocal fingerprint of the topological superconducting phase , which can support majorana states , we study the spin texture of the andreev bound states ( abs ) and of the majorana bound states ( mbs ) in superconductor - normal ( sn ) junctions . as it has been shown in refs .   and , in such junctions extended majorana states can form inside the normal link in the topological phase , which may lead to intriguing phenomena such as fractional josephson effects@xcite .",
    "the dependence of the mbs and abs on the system parameters has been explored quite thoroughly in the past@xcite , and the spin - polarized transport through these states has been touched upon@xcite , but the spatial spin texture of these states in a topological system has until now been generally overlooked@xcite .",
    "we consider quasi-1d wires with both longitudinal and transverse rashba spin - orbit coupling , in the presence of a zeeman field , and for which a section of the wire was brought in the proximity of a superconductor to make a topological sn junction .",
    "we find that the spin texture for such systems exhibits characteristic features when crossing the transition between trivial and topological phases which could be used to identify this transition using techniques such as spin - resolved stm and transport measurements .",
    "in particular we find that the spin - polarized density of states ( spdos ) of the mbs integrated for the entire sn junction , unlike that of the abs in the topologically trivial phase , is nonzero for the spin component parallel to the wire .",
    "thus we prove that measuring the total spdos of the lowest energy state , ( via current injection from spin - polarized leads for example ) , provides one with a good estimate for the topological invariant , distinguishing between the topologically trivial and non - trivial phases .",
    "we propose this as a distinguishing feature of the phase transition .        furthermore in the strictly 1d limit when only a single band is occupied the spdos of the mbs and abs exhibits a moderate accumulation close to the sn boundary .",
    "when one crosses into the trivial phase , the two zero - energy mbs split into two regular abs whose spin polarization shows qualitatively different features than in the topological phase . in particular the asymmetry between the state with positive energy and its negative - energy counterpart becomes very pronounced .",
    "the most striking feature is a change of sign for the spin polarization close to the sn boundary between the topological and the trivial phase .",
    "we consider a generic sn junction ( see fig .  [ schematic ] )",
    "described by the following bogoliubov - de gennes tight - binding hamiltonian for a wire of width @xmath0 : @xmath1\\psi_{j\\ell}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{n_y-1}\\sum_{j=1}^n\\left[\\psi^\\dagger_{j\\ell}(t-{\\textrm{i}}\\alpha{\\bm\\sigma}^x){\\bm\\tau}_z\\psi_{j,\\ell+1}+\\textrm{h.c.}\\right]\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{n_y}\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\left[\\psi^\\dagger_{j\\ell}(t+{\\textrm{i}}\\alpha{\\bm\\sigma}^y){\\bm\\tau}_z\\psi_{j+1,\\ell}+\\textrm{h.c.}\\right]\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] written in the nambu basis @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hopping amplitude , @xmath4 is the chemical potential , @xmath5 is the spin - orbit coupling , @xmath6 is the on - site pairing potential and @xmath7 is the zeeman field . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pauli matrices acting respectively in the spin and the particle - hole subspaces , and the operator @xmath10 creates a particle of spin @xmath11 at site @xmath12 in the quasi-1d wire lattice . for an sn junction of total length @xmath13 ( see fig .  [ schematic ] ) , we have @xmath14    exact diagonalization of this single - particle hamiltonian directly gives us access to the eigenvalues @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the eigenvectors which we write in the nambu basis as @xmath18 . throughout the paper",
    "we will consider @xmath19 , so that all energies are expressed in units of @xmath3 .",
    "the local density of states ( ldos ) and the three local spdos components are defined similarly to ref .  :",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is a gaussian peak , with a width @xmath22 .",
    "this broadening allows us to accurately take into account the overlapping contributions from different bands when they get close to each other or cross .",
    "finally the total spdos components along the direction @xmath23 for a state @xmath24 are defined as @xmath25",
    "we analyze the low - energy states numerically , using the mathq code . as examples we consider @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "these systems can be brought into topologically non - trivial phases by changing for example the zeeman field and the chemical potential .",
    "the lowest - energy state in the system , which in the topological phase is a mbs , shows a clear signature of the non - trivial topology in its total @xmath29 component of the spdos ( integrated over the entire sn system ) .",
    "in particular in the topological region the x - component of the total spdos is non - zero , while in a trivial phase this vanishes .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ total_sx ] where we plot the spatially integrated spdos @xmath29 at the energy corresponding to the lowest state in the system , as a function of magnetic field and chemical potential .",
    "we see that the regions in which the total spdos is non - zero ( corresponding to the regions colored in blue and pink respectively ) overlap exactly with the topological phases predicted for these systems in previous work @xcite .",
    "the limits of the topological phases calculated in these works using the topological invariant is denoted by the black lines in fig .",
    "[ total_sx ] .     for the lowest energy state as a function of magnetic field and chemical potential .",
    "the phase diagram obtained using topological invariant calculations is very accurately recovered : the blue and pink regions correspond to a non - zero total spdos while the solid lines correspond to the analytically calculated phase boundaries.@xcite we use @xmath30 and @xmath31 in all panels .",
    "the widths of the wires are ( a ) @xmath32 , ( b ) @xmath33 , and ( c ) the strictly-1d limit with @xmath26 .",
    "we take @xmath34 . ]",
    "this is a very interesting observation , as the totalspdos can be measured using spin - polarized transport ( tunneling injection from spin - polarized leads , quantum dots , etc . ) .",
    "in such an experiment , if the spin of the leads is parallel to the axis of the wire , the value of the conductance will show abrupt changes at the boundaries between the topological and trivial phases , thus allowing one to test the existence of these boundaries , and thus the formation of a topological phase and mbs .",
    "we can try to understand intuitively the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "a mbs in an sn junction is localized close to the end of the s region @xcite .",
    "its counterpart is extended throughout the normal region , much like an abs@xcite , and , for a large enough superconducting gap and a long enough normal region , it oscillates more or less uniformly .",
    "thus the total contribution of the mbs to the @xmath29 coming from the normal region is close to zero .",
    "however , in the superconducting region , there is a strong anisotropy and most of the dos is localized at the external end , where the majorana state is formed .",
    "the majorana state has a non - zero component of the @xmath29 which thus contributes to a total non - zero spdos for the lowest - energy state of the junction .",
    "note that all the abs states , which are uniformly extended throughout the normal region , have @xmath35 , thus the measure of the spdos is not very sensitive to the accuracy of the measurable energy width , though one should always perform the measurements at the energy corresponding to the lowest energy state .",
    "moreover , in the 1d limit there are additional signatures of the topology in the ldos and local spdos .",
    "we consider a 1d sn junction ( hence @xmath26 ) , with @xmath36 sites , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "we focus on @xmath39 , i.e.  the bottom of the band . in fig .",
    "[ bands_sn ] we plot the dependence of the energy levels near zero energy as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "we note that the transition from the trivial to the topological phase is marked by a merging of the two lowest - energy abs into mbs . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this transition will occur at the critical field @xmath40.@xcite in a finite - size system , and by inspection of fig .",
    "[ bands_sn ] for our system this occurs at a critical value of @xmath41 . ]     in an sn junction .",
    "we set @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    ", width=283 ]    in fig .",
    "[ densityplot_sn ] we plot the two non - zero spin components @xmath29 and @xmath42 , as well as the ldos , as a function of position and zeeman field , at energies given by those of the lowest energy eigenstates ( i.e following the red and respectively blue lines in fig .",
    "[ bands_sn ] ) . for the system considered here @xmath43 . in the topological phase the ldos and @xmath42 exhibit a peak at the external edge of the superconducting section , corresponding to a localized mbs . in the normal region",
    "both the mbs and the abs show a roughly - uniformly - distributed weight in ldos and @xmath42 .",
    "moreover @xmath29 exhibits two peaks , a large one at the external end of the superconductor ( sc ) , and a smaller one of opposite sign at the sn interface . in the trivial phase",
    "we note that the ldos and both spin components show a very marked accumulation close to the sn boundary for the positive energy state , and approximately uniform amplitude oscillations with a small @xmath29 accumulation at the boundary for the negative energy state .",
    "when crossing the phase transition , the majorana state localized at the external end of the sc disappears , as expected .",
    "the first key observation to be made is that the @xmath29 accumulation at the sn interface is changing sign when the systems goes from the trivial to the topological phase .",
    "thus , measuring the @xmath29 dependence on position and zeeman field would allow one to detect the topological transition by an observation of a sign change in @xmath29 at the interface .",
    "this feature is unique to the spdos , and can not be observed in the non - spin - resolved dos .",
    "the second observation is that the first pair of non - zero energy states , ( i.e.  those with positive and negative energies of equal magnitude ) , exhibit identical ldos , as well as identical @xmath29 and @xmath42 components in the topological phase , but different spdos and ldos in the trivial phase .",
    "thus measuring for example @xmath44 can provide one with another tool to identify the transition between the topological and trivial state via a measure of the asymmetry of the spdos between positive and negative energies . as mentioned before this could be used as a signature of the transition between the topological and trivial phase visible both in spin - resolved transport , as well as in spin - polarized stm measurements .",
    "note that these observations are characteristic to the strictly 1d wire and can not be recovered in the quasi-1d wires with transverse rashba .     and @xmath42 spin polarization components , and the ldos , as a function of position and @xmath7 when following the evolution of the mbs into an abs doublet .",

    "the observations described here are quite general as we have shown by taking different numbers of coupled wires for the quasi-1d systems .",
    "we have checked that they are valid as long as the length of the normal section is long enough ( larger than the superconducting penetration depth , coherence length and spin - orbit length ) .",
    "also we have checked that the results are qualitatively unchanged by scattering at the sn boundary for not too large interface scattering values ( see the appendices for more details ) , as well as for weak static disorder . as detailed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for randomly distributed impurities with strength varying between @xmath54 , the majorana states are destroyed for @xmath55 larger than a critical value of about @xmath56 , but our conclusion still holds , in that as long as the majorana states exist , the total @xmath29 is non - zero , and @xmath29 goes to zero in the non - topological state , concomitant with the destruction of the majoranas .",
    "this observation confirms and strengthens our conclusion that the formation of majorana states is correlated with a total non - zero @xmath29 component of the spdos .",
    "more details of the disorder analysis are presented in the sm .",
    "we have also checked that our results do not rely on a sharp boundary between the superconducting and normal wires , thus in the sm we consider the effects of a finite sc penetration depth , and we show that our results remain generally valid .",
    "we have studied the spin texture for the abs and mbs in trivial and topological sn junctions . we have found that this is a good indicator of the topological transition .",
    "thus , for generic sn junctions the total spin - polarized density of states @xmath29 maps out accurately the topological phase diagram , which could be measured in spin - resolved transport experiments . in",
    "a strictly 1d sn junction @xmath42 component is symmetric between positive and negative energies only in the topological phase , while exhibiting a positive - negative energy asymmetry in the trivial phase .",
    "moreover , in this limit the @xmath29 spin accumulation at the interface changes sign at the transition .",
    "such features are unique to the spdos and provide an unequivocal signature of the topological phase transition",
    ". it would be interesting to confirm our observations for more realistic calculations for junctions made using inas and insb wires and consider their characteristic lattice structure , size , spin - orbit coupling , ns interface properties , etc .",
    "however , as described above , we argue that our observations are a direct result of the intrinsic physics associated with the formation of majorana states , and are thus quite generic and should hold for any quasi-1d wire .",
    "in contrast to the observation of a zero - energy peak , the features described here are extremely unlikely to have alternative explanations . thus we claim that the transition between the topological and trivial phase could be directly and unequivocally visualized in either spin - resolved transport or spin - polarized tunneling spectroscopy experiments .",
