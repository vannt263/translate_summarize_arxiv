    "a widely applicable analysis of unitary quantum walks has remained illusive due to a strong dependence on the initial state that is exacerbated by the lack of convergence to a steady state ( which is not necessarily the case for open quantum walks  @xcite ) . to overcome this and obtain a result that is relevant beyond specific initial states and walk durations",
    ", we consider a quantity that characterizes each walk over long times and relate this to another quantity that characterizes each initial state .",
    "specifically , we characterize a walk by the long time average probability distribution of finding the walker at each node  @xcite , which captures all knowledge of the location of the walker in the absence of knowledge about when the walk began .",
    "the initial state is naturally characterized by the energy , which gives a total ordering of the initial states .",
    "we show that for low energies the long time average probability distribution is equal to the normalized distribution of degrees in the network . specifically , the energy bounds the trace distance between the two distributions .",
    "this provides a wide class of quantum walks on complex networks with an analytically tractable low energy regime .",
    "our result is achieved by mapping the properties of the ground state of a quantum walk to the steady state of a corresponding classical walk . in particular , a classical walk whose steady state represents the connectivity of nodes as determined by their degree .",

    "we use dirac notation and represent @xmath12 in terms of @xmath7 orthonormal vectors @xmath13 .",
    "the network gives rise to both a quantum walk and a corresponding classical walk .",

    "when considering quantum walks on networks , it is natural to ask what is the long time behavior of a quantum walker @xcite .",

    "this is expected since the network has the higher degree heterogeneity .",
    "the network , which is well known to have quite uniform degrees  @xcite , is accordingly the network with the lowest quantum correction .    for many of the network types",
    "the typical quantumness can be obtained from the expected ( thermodynamic limit ) degree distribution . in the network ,",
    "the degree distribution approximately obeys the continuous probability density @xmath101  @xcite . integrating this to find the moments , results in @xmath102 , which is independent of the average degree @xmath103 and is compatible with our numerics .",

    "the size of the quantum effects can be enhanced by introducing heterogeneous weights @xmath10 within a network .",
    "we have done this for a network using several iterations of the following procedure .",
    "a pair of connected nodes is randomly selected then the associated weight is doubled of halved at random . as anticipated , the effect is to increase the discrepancy between the classical and quantum dependence of the long time average probability on degree , illustrated in fig .",

    "we find that for some networks , e.g. , the ba , er and ws networks , the bound is quite restrictive and reasonably saturated .",
    "however for the other networks we find that quantumness takes a low value without this being ensured by the bound only , see table  [ tab : en - bound ] .",
    "finally , our numerical calculations reveal the behavior of the quantum part @xmath115 of the long time average node occupation .",
    "we find that the quantum part enhances the long time average probability of being at nodes with small degree relative to the classical part .",
    "more precisely @xmath116 exhibits roughly @xmath117 scaling , with @xmath118 , as shown in fig .",

    "quantitative details vary between the network types , but appear robust within each type .",
    "the models of networks examined in the previous subsection have very specific topologies and therefore degree distributions , and do not capture the topological properties of all real - world networks ( for details see chapter 9 of ref .",

    "therefore the classical and quantum distributions are very close , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : average ] .",
    "additionally , the quantum correction exhibits the same generic behavior as observed for the artificial networks ; figure [ fig : diff ] shows an enhancement of the probability of being in nodes of small degree .",
    "interestingly , the quantumness of real - world networks is appreciably smaller than enforced by the bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq : energybound ] ) , with @xmath120 taking large values , as shown in table [ tab : en - bound ] .",
    "we have found an analytical expression for the average long time probability distribution for the location of a low energy quantum walker on a complex network of _ arbitrary _ topology .",
    "specifically we have shown this is equal to the distribution arising in the steady state of a corresponding classical walk , equal to the normalized degrees . as well as providing an analytical solution for low - energy walks , our result will allow the benchmarking of other methods for studying quantum walks on complex networks , a field in which numerical analysis is typically the only viable option .",
    "the stationary state of the classical walk generated the asymmetrically normalized laplacian @xmath6 is closely connected to the ranking of nodes within a network , as used by google .",
    "therefore our results indicate the long time average probability distribution of a quantum walk under @xmath21 with the energy of the initial state as a free parameter could provide a means of interpolating between classical and quantum  @xcite ranking of real - world networks .",
    "this idea also connects nicely with the work of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the authors numerically simulate driving a quantum system to its ground state , with the quantum system chosen such that its ground state represents the google ranking vector .    for the evenly distributed initial state ,",
    "the quantumness ( loosely speaking , the difference between the classical and quantum distributions ) only depends on the degrees . together with our result for the low energy distribution",
    ", it shows that the degree distribution can be as important and illuminating in quantum walks as in their classical counterparts .",
    "our numerical examples also show that for remarkably diverse network types , quantum effects are qualitatively similar ; they act to reduce the degree dependence of the average probability of a walker being found on a node .",
    "our presentation focused on a walker state @xmath121 that is a time average over a unitary evolution .",
    "however , to conclude , note that our analytical solution to the expected node occupation @xmath122 holds whenever a significant portion of @xmath121 is in the ground state subspace of @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath123 is small . to see this",
