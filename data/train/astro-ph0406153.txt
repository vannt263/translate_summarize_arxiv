    "the very rapid evolution of quasars from @xmath2 to the present ( boyle et al .",
    "1987 ) raises the question of whether any properties of these sources other than space density have changed over this interval .",
    "one way to probe changes in the agn population is to compare spectral energy distributions ( seds ) over a broad frequency range as a function of redshift .",
    "the sed of an active galaxy reflects the presence of the underlying agn , plus the luminosity of the host galaxy stellar population , the reddening of the agn , and the role of star formation , all in different frequency regimes .",
    "sed determination in large samples of high-@xmath3 agn using imaging detectors is therefore an efficient way to survey for evolutionary trends in quasars and agn , and in their host galaxies .",
    "a number of trends might be expected .",
    "will we be able to confirm predictions that the relative number of obscured agn was higher at large lookback times than now , to fit models of the x - ray background ( e.g. , gilli , risaliti , & salvati 1999 ) ?",
    "agn activity may be triggered by gas inflow caused by galaxy interactions .",
    "interactions also trigger starbursts  will we find that an elevated rate of star formation in the host galaxy is a typical characteristic of distant agn ?",
    "will younger agn host galaxies have more material in their ism than current - epoch ones , causing greater extinction of their nuclei ?    to probe such questions , we have used irac ( fazio et al . 2004 ) , mips ( rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) , and ancillary data to assemble seds for agn in the lockman hole ( lh ) and extended groth strip ( egs ) .",
    "we have made use of deep x - ray images to locate the agn .",
    "for this initial survey , we wanted an unambiguous detection of an infrared ( ir ) excess to make sed classification robust .",
    "we have included objects detected at @xmath0 m , although we briefly discuss galaxies not detected at @xmath0 m . we compare the results with seds of a sample of nearby ( @xmath4 ) hard x - ray selected agn that are bright in the mid - ir , and hence nominally similar to the sources identified in the deep _ spitzer_/x - ray fields .",
    "this comparison allows us to make tentative identifications of trends in the agn / host galaxy behavior from the typical redshift of the agn in the survey fields ( @xmath5 to 1.6 ) to the present .",
    "we have obtained @xmath0 m mips observations of two fields in the lh : primary field ( area of @xmath6 ) at @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( j2000 ) , and parallel field ( area of @xmath9 ) at @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we also obtained mips observations of the egs overlapping with the _ chandra _ observation ( @xmath12arcmin@xmath13 , see next section ) at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "the lh primary field and the egs were observed by irac at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and @xmath20 .",

    "counterparts of all mips and x - ray sources were nearly pointlike , and the photometry used circular apertures and the standard point - source calibration ( see huang et al .",

    "the data cover entirely both the primary and parallel @xmath0 m mips fields .",
    "we produced images in the energy bands @xmath21kev , @xmath22kev , @xmath23kev , and @xmath24kev , and searched for sources simultaneously in an iterative process to optimize the background model and thereby the sensitivity . in the lh",
    "we have detected 35 xmm sources with x - ray fluxes down to @xmath25 .",
    "the astrometric uncertainties are better than 1   for bright sources , and less than @xmath26   for the faintest sources .    for the egs , three _",
    "acis datasets were taken from the cxc archive with an exposure time of 131ks .",
    "we searched for sources separately in four bands ( @xmath27kev , @xmath22kev , @xmath28kev , and @xmath29kev ) using wavdetect . in the overlapping area between the _ chandra _ and mips fields",
    "we have detected 77 sources in the full band with fluxes down to @xmath30 .",
    "of these , 40 are detected in the @xmath28kev band .",
    "astrometric uncertainties are @xmath31 , where the high value is for sources at large off - axis angles .",
    "taking into account the astrometric uncertainties we used radii of 2.2  and 3  for matching @xmath0 m sources to chandra and xmm sources , respectively . within the lh",
    "approximately @xmath32% of the xmm sources are detected at @xmath0 m .",
    "75% of lh x - ray sources with @xmath33 have @xmath34 counterparts . in the egs",
    "approximately 50% of chandra sources have a @xmath0 m counterpart , and this fraction is @xmath35 for sources detected in the hard ( @xmath28kev ) band .",
    "taking into account the surface density of @xmath0 m sources ( 80% completeness limit ) , the probability of a chance match with an x - ray source is @xmath36% for both the lh and egs .",
    "hard x - ray to mid - ir flux ratios are known to be different for agn dominated galaxies and starbursts in the local universe , and can be used to assess if the agn emission is dominant in the mid - ir .",

    ". this sample should be nominally similar to the sources studied here .",
    "the effect of increasing redshift on the observed ratio of hard x - ray to mid - ir fluxes is small for agn with low x - ray column densities , but it will make this ratio increase for compton thick agn at higher @xmath3 ( alexander et al . 2001 ) . for starbursts at @xmath39 , alexander et al .",
    "( 2001 ) predict just a slight decrease of the ratio of hard x - ray to mid - ir emission for increasing @xmath3 . the majority of sources in this study appear to derive their x - ray emission from powerful agn because they lie in the region of fig .  1 populated by local hard x - ray - selected agn extrapolated to fainter fluxes ( fadda et al .",
    "2002 ; franceschini et al . 2001 ; alexander et al .",
    "2001 ) , and because for our sample the @xmath3-dependent effects ( see next section ) in this figure are small .    also shown in fig",
    ".  1 are sources in the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) from rigby et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . the greater sensitivity of the cdf - s x - ray data ( compared with the egs and lh ) results in detection of relatively weaker x - ray sources that either have a greater portion of their luminosity generated from star formation , or are obscured in the x - rays ( compare to figure  1 in alexander et al .",
    "2002 ) . indeed ,",
    "spectroscopic observations of faint sources detected in the deepest x - ray surveys to date indicate that these are starbursts and low - redshift normal galaxies ( barger et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "all x - ray sources in the lh not detected at @xmath0 m appear to be consistent with being type 1 agn or s0/elliptical galaxies ( see next section ) .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that most x - ray emitting galaxies in the hdf - n with no mid - ir emission are classified spectroscopically as s0/elliptical galaxies ; that is , they showed no emission - line evidence for activity .",
    "x - ray hardness ratios can be used to distinguish between low - obscuration ( soft ) and high - obscuration ( hard ) agn ( e.g. , hasinger et al .",
    "2001 ; mainieri et al .",
    "2002 ; szokoly et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this x - ray classification agrees with the spectroscopic classification of type 1 ( broad lines ) and type 2 ( narrow lines ) agn , respectively .",
    "based on their hard to soft flux ratios , there are approximately equal numbers of type 1 and type 2 agn among the hard x - ray selected sources in the lh and egs with and without mid - ir emission .",
    "this finding is in contrast with the local sample of hard x - ray selected agn of piccinotti et al .",
    "( 1982 ) where most of the sources are classified as type 1 agn ( @xmath40% for agn at @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have collected optical and near - ir data for all the x - ray/24@xmath1 m sources in the egs and lh ( crist ' obal - hornillos et al .",
    "2003 ; wilson 2003 ) .",
    "the observations have been band merged with the _ spitzer _ data as described by le floch et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we used spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for 5 x - ray sources in the lh ( lehmann et al .",
    "2001 ; mainieri et al .",
    "2002 ) and 9 sources in the egs ( from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe and miyaji et al .",
    "2004 ) . for the remaining sources , we estimated photometric redshifts where possible from the stellar spectral peak at @xmath41 m ( see le floch et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we then classified the x - ray/@xmath34 sources according to the shape of their seds .",
    "sources that are relatively flat in @xmath42 from the optical through the mid - ir , resembling the median qso sed of elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , are termed type 1 agn ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "sources that are relatively flat in @xmath42 at the irac and mips wavelengths , but whose spectra drop toward the blue are consistent with being obscured agn .",
    "although the redshifts can not be estimated well for these two types of objects , the seds are distinctive and the classification unambiguous .",
    "galaxies with decreasing @xmath42 in the range @xmath43 m and a significant stellar contribution in the optical and near - ir resemble type 2 agn or spiral / starburst galaxies , and their seds appear intermediate between that of circinus and that of m82 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the majority of these sources have spectroscopic / photometric redshifts in the range @xmath44 .",
    "a few galaxies have increasing @xmath42 for @xmath45 m , and look similar to local ulirgs ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "table  1 lists the x - ray properties and sed types for those egs sources with well determined seds ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "for the 45 x - ray/24@xmath1 m sources in our sample with sed type , we find that 10 can be classified as pure type 1 agn sed , 27 as obscured agn , type 2 agn , or spiral / m82-like sed , and 8 as ulirg - like sed . in the absence of quality x - ray data , the optical - to - mid - ir sed does not unambiguously identify agn activity .",
    "this will complicate efforts to identify complete samples of agn via optical and _ spitzer _ photometry .",
    "3 shows the hard to soft x - ray flux ratio distributions for the three different types of seds .",
    "all galaxies with type 1 agn - like seds show a range of hard to soft flux ratios consistent with those of spectroscopically classified type 1 agn ( that is , broad - line agn ) .",
    "galaxies with obscured agn , type 2 agn , and spiral / m82-like seds include a fraction of sources that would be classified as type 1 agn based on their x - ray properties .",
    "ulirg - sed objects appear to have a tendency toward softer x - ray flux ratios characteristic of type 1 agn .",
    "more than half of the bright x - ray/@xmath34 sources in our sample have seds dominated by stellar emission or show a significant level of obscuration .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that @xmath46% of the chandra selected galaxies have optical spectra with no signs of nuclear agn activity ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "2001 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "many of these galaxies have colors of old stellar populations ( barger et al .",
    "it is possible that their agn emission lines are overwhelmed by stellar light ( see moran , filippenko , & chornock 2002 ) .",
    "others appear highly absorbed in x - rays ( barger et al . 2001 , see also fig .",
    "3 ) ; if a similar level of absorption applies to their emission lines , these lines will be undetectable . in agreement with the finding that spectroscopic type 1 ( broad lines ) agn behavior",
    "is relatively rare ( e.g. , hornschemeier et al . 2001 ) , the fraction of type 1 agn sed dominated x - ray sources in our sample is small .",
    "about one - third of the sources with emission in hard x - rays are not detected at @xmath0 m .",
    "4 shows two such x - ray sources in the lh whose seds are consistent with being s0 or elliptical galaxies , with no evidence for the presence of hot dust .",
    "based on findings by alexander et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the hdf - n , a significant fraction of x - ray sources detected by irac but not by mips at @xmath0 m are likely to have seds like elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "to put these trends on a more quantitative basis , we have used local hard - x - ray selected agn from piccinotti et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to construct a comparison sample consisting of all galaxies with @xmath47 0.12 and a mid - ir @xmath48 flux density @xmath49mjy . in this local sample ,",
    "19 of 32 galaxies , more than half the sample , would be classified by us as type 1 agn based on their seds . from the hard x - ray/@xmath34 detections in the egs and lh ,",
    "we classify 7 of 29 as having seds resembling those of type 1 agn .",
    "since only 2/3 of sources with hard x - ray emission were detected at @xmath0 m , some caution is needed in interpreting this result . however , since a significant fraction of the x - ray sources without @xmath0 m detections are likely to have s0/elliptical type seds , it is possible that there is a trend away from pure type 1 agn behavior with increasing redshift .",
    "this possibility will be probed by further _ spitzer _",
    "observations of deep x - ray fields that are currently under analysis .",
    "this work is based [ in part ] on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech under nasa contract 1407 .",
