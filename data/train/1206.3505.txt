    "when the zero field splitting is larger than the optical linewidth , repeated optical excitation leads to a spin selective steady state population in the lowest @xmath2 level of the ground state , generating a non - boltzmann steady state spin alignment and mixing of spin states @xcite , so the spin of the ground state can be both initialized and read out optically @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure for spin manipulation in the ground state triplet involves an oscillatory ( radio - frequency ) magnetic field that gives rise to electron spin resonance . in this paper , we describe an alternative method for full spin control without rf - fields , based entirely on optical transitions .",
