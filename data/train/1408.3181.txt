    "ehicular ad hoc networks ( vanets ) have been envisioned to provide increased convenience and efficiency to drivers , with numerous applications ranging from traffic safety , traffic efficiency to infotainment @xcite .",
    "one particular type of downloading services has attracted a lot of attentions for its applications in both safety - related and commercial areas .",
    "that is , the distribution of popular multimedia contents to on - board units ( obus ) inside a geographical area of interest ( aoi ) by roadside units ( rsus ) , which is referred to as popular content distribution ( pcd ) in @xcite .",
    "examples of pcd may include : a local hotel periodically broadcasts multimedia advertisements to the vehicles entering the city on suburban highway ; a local travel company advertising the current activities in scenic areas to the passing vehicles ; and a traffic authority delivers real - time traffic information ahead , or disseminates an update version of local gps map @xcite .    on the internet ,",
    "the downloading services of large files ( e.g. high - definition movies ) often adopt peer - to - peer ( p2p ) protocols , such as bittorrent and edonkey2000 @xcite .",
    "those p2p systems go beyond client - server systems by introducing symmetry ideas ( a client may also be a server ) and enjoy high performances in data rate , delay , scalability , and robustness . for pcd in vanets , it is natural to adopt p2p ideas for improving the network performance .",
    "actually , since it takes usually less than @xmath0 minute for moving vehicles to drive through the coverage of an rsu , the obus may fail to download the large popular file ( e.g. an advertisement video may be as large as @xmath1 mb ) directly from rsus within the limited time for vehicle - to - roadside ( v2r ) transmissions . for completely downloading the popular file ,",
    "it is not only optional , but also essential for the obus to build a self - organizing decentralized p2p network , in which popular packets are exchanged among obus through vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) channels .",
    "however , those p2p techniques on the internet should be carefully inspected before applying in the proposed pcd problem for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "the wireless links in vanets are unreliable due to both deep fading and co - channel interference , compared to the wired links on the internet .",
    "the network topology of a vanet is unpredictable and ever - changing , due to the high mobility of obus , compared to the static topology of the internet .",
    "hence , p2p protocols in vanets are no longer application level protocols based on reliable transmissions , but cross - layer protocols that jointly considers content request , peer location , channel capacity , and potential interference .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author first studied cooperative downloading services in vanets , in which they proposed spawn , a pull - based , p2p content downloading protocol that extends bittorrent .",
    "however , the peer and content selection mechanisms have high overhead and are not scalable , especially when most of the vehicles are interested in downloading popular contents . in @xcite , network coding ( nc )",
    "methods were proposed , in which packets are mixed together by coding at every intermediate node and the broadcast nature of wireless medium is exploited , so that the usefulness of each coded packet is increased .",
    "in @xcite , the author focused on the link layer , and proposed vc - mac , a cooperative medium access control ( mac ) protocol for gateway downloading scenarios in vehicular networks , to maximize the  broadcast throughput \" .    in this paper , we propose a p2p approach to address the pcd problem in vanets , in which the obus are allowed to exchange data and complement their missing packets . among all the possible p2p solutions ,",
    "the non - cooperative approach is simple to apply , in which the obus share no information and response to any data request from other obus .",
    "however , since the transmissions are not coordinated , the non - cooperative approach might be inefficient due to the collisions and repeated transmissions .",
    "therefore , we consider to introduce cooperation among obus , i.e. , the obus can share some information to make the p2p approach more efficient .",
    "particularly , we adopt the coalitional graph game model as first introduced by myerson in @xcite . in a coalitional graph game ,",
    "the players try to maximize their individual payoffs , which are related to the specific graph that interconnects them .",
    "this model has recently been used in many graph - based communication problems @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author investigated the problem of the formation of an uplink tree structure in the ieee 802.16j standard with the coalitional graph game model , in which the relay stations form a directed tree graph to improve their utility considering both packet success rate and link maintenance cost . in @xcite ,",
    "the author considered a network formation game where the nodes wish to send traffic to each other and a form of the myopic best response dynamics is proposed . in the proposed pcd problem , we introduce a coalitional graph game model considering content request , peer location , channel capacity , and network topology , and a coalition formation algorithm is proposed to implement the p2p approach based on this model .    also , we utilize cognitive radio ( cr ) for v2v transmissions in the proposed approach . in vanets ,",
    "v2v links might be blocked by the factors such as deep channel fadings and severe data collisions . by exploiting cr ,",
    "it is possible to utilize other available channels with better channel conditions , which in result , increases the sum transmission rate and reduces data collisions in the network . therefore , cr is better for qos for delay sensitive applications .",
    "moveover , the vehicles can easily provide sufficient power and space that are especially needed by cr devices .",
    "and in vehicular environments , especially in suburban highways , the spectrum is relatively clean and there are plenty of spectrum holes that can by utilized by cr .",
    "thus , cr is beneficial in vanets .",
    "considering all the benefits , we utilize cr for the vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) transmissions in the p2p approach .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a coalitional graph game model to the popular content distribution problem in vanets .",
    "based on the game theory model , a distributed coalition formation algorithm is proposed , in which the obus self - organize into coalitions to coordinate their v2v and v2i transmissions .",
    "simulation results show that , using the proposed algorithm , the maximal total throughput is increased by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , relative to the non - cooperative approach and the pure broadcasting scheme . and the total possessed packets are increased by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , relative to the non - cooperative approach and the pure broadcasting scheme .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section provides the system model and the non - cooperative approach . in section",
    ", we formulate the graph - based utility function and present a coalitional graph game for modeling the transmitting behaviors of obus . in section , we exposes the properties of the coalitional graph game as well as the dynamics algorithm for forming a best - response network graph . in section simulation results and analysis",
    "are presented , and in section we conclude the paper .",
    "consider a vanet consisting of @xmath6 obus driving through the coverage of a rsu . a popular content , which has been equally divided into @xmath7 packets with the size of each packet @xmath8 , is broadcasted at an authorized frequency band ( e.g. the @xmath9mhz bandwidth in the 5.9ghz band for ieee 802.11p @xcite ) from the rsu to the obus inside the coverage .",
    "we suppose the v2r transmission time is not sufficient for any obu to download the entire file , but a few packets .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the set of obus , and the set of packets , and the set of packets possessed by obu @xmath13 , respectively .    for downloading of the entire file ,",
    "a p2p network is built among obus by unauthorized channels using cognitive radio .",
    "we suppose there are @xmath14 such channels with primary traffic modeled as @xmath14 independent poisson processes with the same arriving rate @xmath15 per time slot . in each slot , every obu in the network transmits , or not , to another obu through an empty channel .",
    "the obus keep exchanging their possessed packets until every obu in the network achieves the entire file , formally , @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the set of unauthorized channels and the set of unauthorized channels sensed by obu @xmath13 , respectively .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] , the evolution of the popular file in an obu is illustrated .",
    "when an obu arrives in the range of the rsu , it immediately receives the broadcasted packets from the rsu . as getting out of range",
    ", it starts the p2p transmissions with other obus in unauthorized channels using cognitive radio .",
    "after finite p2p transmissions , the popular content can be entirely obtained by all obus in the network .      in this paper",
    ", we suppose all obus and the rsu are equipped with single omnidirectional antenna .",
    "the rsu periodically broadcasts the popular file at an authorized frequency with data rate @xmath19 . for the v2r channels between the rsu and the obus inside its coverage",
    ", we adopt rayleigh model for small - scale fading and a path loss model with the path loss exponent equal to @xmath20 .",
    "for simplicity without loss of generality , we do not consider the shadowing by other vehicles . also , we assume in the same slot the channel is unchanged .",
    "thus , the gain of the v2r channel between the rsu and any obu @xmath13 , denoted by @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a complex gaussian random variable with unit variance and zero mean , and @xmath24 is the distance between the rsu and obu @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the capacity of the v2r channel between the rsu and obu @xmath13 , denoted by @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bandwidth authorized for v2r communications and @xmath28 a scale factor representing the transmit power of the rsu . in each slot , we assume obu @xmath13 can receive useful data from the rsu if and only if @xmath29 .    for the v2v channels , we suppose the transmitting signal from any obu @xmath13 can only be received by its  neighbors \" ( the obus with a line of sight ( los ) to obu @xmath13 ) @xcite , denoted by @xmath30 . for those channels with a los , we adopt a similar model as the v2r channels .",
    "thus , the channel gain @xmath31 between obu @xmath13 and obu @xmath32 in the @xmath33-th unauthorized channel is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the distance between obu @xmath13 and obu @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding capacity , denoted by @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the bandwidth of the @xmath33-th channel , @xmath41 a scale factor representing the transmit power at obu @xmath13 . for simplicity without loss of of generality",
    ", we assume @xmath42 and @xmath43 .      in the non - cooperative manner , the p2p transmissions do not coordinate with each other .",
    "for any obu @xmath44 , its packet request is broadcasted to its  neighbors \" at the beginning of each slot , and the first responding obu , e.g. , obu @xmath36 , transmits the requested packets to obu @xmath13 .",
    "for finding available channels , obu @xmath36 randomly senses @xmath45 unauthorized channels , the set of which is denoted by @xmath46 , and for each channel with a constant time @xmath47 .",
    "if the period of a slot is @xmath48 , the transmitting time left is then @xmath49 , and the corresponding rate is given by @xmath50 the channel with the largest transmission rate is selected by obu @xmath36 , which is given by @xmath51    we suppose the relation between @xmath52 and the maximum channel capacity @xmath53 can be given by a function @xmath54 in the average sense . the transmission rate in ( [ v2vbestrate ] )",
    "is then rewritten as @xmath55 to maximize @xmath56 , we have @xmath52 must satisfy @xmath57 we further suppose @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then , ( [ kjdecide1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath60 equation ( [ kjdecide2 ] ) can be easily solved by numerical solutions and the result can be seen as a reference value for @xmath52 .",
    "we adopt a logarithmic form as the expression of @xmath54 for the following reasons : ( 1 ) @xmath54 must be an increasing function , since an extra channel can only increase , or at least , maintains the maximum capacity in average sense , ( 2 ) @xmath54 must be a concave function , since the contribution of an extra channel will be mitigated by the increasing channel number .    in the above analysis , we do not consider any data collisions , which , however , are inevitable",
    ". as we noted , the transmitting signal from any obu @xmath13 can only be received by its  neighbors \" .",
    "thus , the signal as well as the interference are both confined in the  neighbors \" .",
    "considering the potential collisions with primary users ( the users with spectrum license ) and other obus , the successful transmitting conditions are : ( 1 ) a los exists between obu @xmath13 and obu @xmath36 , ( 2 ) no primary traffic exists in the @xmath33-th channel , ( 3 ) no  neighbors \" of obu @xmath13 transmit in the @xmath33-th channel . in fact , the influence of collisions has been involved in factor @xmath61 when we suppose @xmath62 , which makes no difference in the result .",
    "for the proposed pcd problem , we have provided a non - cooperative solution , in which the sensing - throughput tradeoff has been locally optimized . however , due to the random establishment of v2v links , the obus may be connected to inefficient  neighbors \" or even with no  neighbor \" to be connected to .",
    "thus , the entire network may suffer from low data throughput , or equivalently , high transmission delay . in this section",
    ", we introduce a coalitional graph game model to coordinate the v2v links between different obus and also the v2r links from the rsu to the obus . in this model",
    ", each obu decides to connect to or be connected to other obus in order to maximize its own utility that takes into account data throughput as well as link maintaining cost .",
    "the result of the interactions among the obus is a directed graph @xmath63 with @xmath64 denoting the set of all nodes ( the obus and the rsu ) and @xmath65 denoting the set of all edges ( v2v links and v2r links ) . for any @xmath66",
    ", we say the link from @xmath13 to @xmath36 exists , if @xmath67 .      for any obu @xmath44",
    ", we suppose positive utilities can be extracted from both the effective packets received from and transmitted to other obus , which depends on the current links associated with obu @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the utility function is a graph - based function , which is denoted by @xmath68 . due to the single antenna , the maximum number of connections from or to obu @xmath13 is confined to @xmath0 , which implies the out - degree @xmath69 and in - degree @xmath70 of node @xmath13 in graph @xmath71 satisfying @xmath72 . using the broadcasting channel ,",
    "the rsu can connect to as many obus as possible while no obu can connect to it , which implies out - degree @xmath73 and in - degree @xmath74 of the rsu in graph @xmath71 satisfying @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding utility of the received packets , denoted by @xmath76 , is assumed to be proportional to the number of received packets , which is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a pricing factor and @xmath79 is the probability of successful transmission from obu @xmath36 to obu @xmath13 , the expression of which will be given in the following part of the section .",
    "the corresponding utility of the transmitted packets , denoted by @xmath80 , is assumed to be proportional to the number of transmitted packets , which is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a pricing factor and @xmath83 is the probability of successful transmission from obu @xmath13 to obu @xmath36 , the expression of which will be given in the following part of the section .",
    "the main driver behind the transmitting benefit is that the importance of the role of obu @xmath13 increases if obu @xmath13 serves more obus , and , thus , its utility should increase .    when obu @xmath13 transmits or receives data , certain channels are occupied , which increases the probability of data collisions .",
    "the cost of potential collisions is proportional to the number of obus that has been interfered . for the link from obu @xmath13",
    ", the interference is confined in obu @xmath13 s  neighbors \" @xmath30 . for the link from obu @xmath36 to obu @xmath13",
    ", the interference is confined in obu @xmath36 s  neighbors \" @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the cost function , denoted by @xmath85 , is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a pricing factor .    in summary , given a transmission graph @xmath63 ,",
    "the cost and benefit of obu @xmath44 is captured by the following utility function @xmath88      for any given unauthorized channel @xmath89 and any obu @xmath44 , the probability of miss ( i.e. , probability of missing the detection of the primary traffic ) and false alarm ( i.e. , probability of the false detection of the primary traffic ) are denoted by @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively . for simplicity without loss of generality , we suppose the sensing devices in all obus have the same performance for any channels , which implies @xmath92 .",
    "as we noted , the primary traffic in any channel @xmath33 is modeled as a poisson process with parameter @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the probability that no primary traffic occupies channel @xmath33 is denoted by @xmath93 .",
    "we consider the probability of successful transmission from obu @xmath13 to obu @xmath36 , denoted by @xmath83 . for a successful transmission , the link from obu @xmath13 to obu @xmath36",
    "should not be interfered by other obus , which implies that none of obu @xmath36 s  neighbors \" is transmitting at the same channel . in the average sense , there are @xmath94 channels available for v2v transmission and obu @xmath13 occupies one of them .",
    "thus , the probability that obu @xmath36 s neighbors do not transmit at the same channel is given by @xmath95 we denote by @xmath96 the hypothesis that the unauthorized channel is occupied by a primary user in real , and @xmath97 the alternative hypothesis .",
    "also , we denote by @xmath98 the hypothesis that the sensing result shows the unauthorized channel is occupied , and @xmath99 the alternative hypothesis . thus , the possibility that the empty decision of the unauthorized channel is correct can be expressed by : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "note that ( [ probabiliypu1 ] ) is also the probability that the transmission from obu @xmath13 to obu @xmath36 does not collide with primary traffic , we rewrite this probability as @xmath105 thus , the probability of successful transmission from obu @xmath13 to obu @xmath36 is given by @xmath106 which completes the expressions of @xmath76 , @xmath80 in ( [ utilityin ] ) , ( [ utilityout ] ) , respectively .",
    "in this section , we propose a myopic dynamics algorithm for the coalitional graph game , which results in a directed graph that coordinates the transmissions in the network .",

    "the proposed network formation algorithm is distributively carried out by each obu in the network . given the transmission graph @xmath63 , the available strategies any obu @xmath44 are classified as follows :    1 .",

    "note that the proposed algorithm focuses on maximizing the current utility @xmath125 of obu @xmath13 , some of the strategies in @xmath122 may be infeasible for reducing the utilities of corresponding obus . for strategies that only involves in breaking down old links ( e.g. , item 2 and item 4 ) , the utility @xmath125 of obu @xmath13 should be improved , or at least maintained the same . for strategies that involves in forming new links ( e.g. , item 1 and item 3 ) , both the utility @xmath125 of obu @xmath13 and the utility @xmath126 of obu @xmath36 should be improved , or at least maintained the same .",

    "this constraint need every node be aware of the topology of the entire network , which is not a big problem in @xcite since the nodes are relay stations with fixed locations and high transmitting power . however , in our scenario , where the nodes are obus with high mobility and limited transmitting power , it is difficult for every obu to achieve the entire topology within a slot - level period .",

    "the pure broadcasting is a scheme in which no v2v transmission is allowed and all the obus can only receive from the rsu . the pure broadcasting scheme can be seen as a lower bound for evaluating all possible p2p approaches . also , we give an upper bound with the optimal solution , in which the overall information has been considered and an optimal solution has been derived by enumeration . the mobility model and system parameters are presented in the following subsection .",
    "the mobility model we use is similar to the freeway mobility model ( fmm ) proposed in @xcite , which is well accepted for modeling the traffic in highway scenarios . in ffm ,",
    "the simulation area includes many multiple lane freeways without intersections . at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the vehicles are randomly placed in the lanes , and move at history - based speeds .",
    "the vehicles randomly accelerate or decelerate with the security distance @xmath165 maintained between two subsequent vehicles in the same lane and no change of lanes is allowed .    in our scenario ,",
    "the map has been simplified to a one - way traffic road with double lanes as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] .",
    "all the obus independently choose to speed up or slow down by probability @xmath166 and acceleration @xmath167 .",
    "the velocity of any obu @xmath149 is limited by @xmath168 for all time .",
    "to better reflect the changing topology of vanets , we decide to allow the change of lanes when a vehicle is overtaking , as long as the security distance is maintained . also , to prevent the vehicles from being widely scattered , we also give an upper bound @xmath169 for the distance between any two subsequent vehicles in the same lane .",
    "the overall constraints in our mobility model are listed as follows :    1 .",
    "the obus are randomly placed on both lanes in an area with length @xmath170 that is @xmath171 away form the rsu when the simulation begins .",
    "the initial speed of obu @xmath44 , denoted by @xmath172 , is randomly given in @xmath173 $ ] .",
    "the speed of obu @xmath44 satisfies : @xmath174 where @xmath166 is the probability of acceleration or deceleration .",
    "4 .   for any obu @xmath149 with obu @xmath175 ahead in the same lane and obu @xmath176 ahead in the other lane , obu @xmath13 switches to the other lane , if @xmath177 and @xmath178 , or obu @xmath13 decelerates to @xmath179 , if @xmath180",
    ". 5 .   for any obu @xmath149 with obu @xmath175",
    "ahead in the same lane , obu @xmath13 accelerates to @xmath181 , if @xmath182 .",
    "the parameters are taken from a general highway scenario as shown in table [ parameters ] .      in fig .",
    "[ service_rate ] , we show the total throughput as a function of time for networks with @xmath183 , and @xmath184 .",
    "let @xmath185 denote the total possessed packets in the network .",
    "then , the total throughput is given by @xmath186 , which represents the packets successfully delivered at current slot @xmath146 .",
    "for pure broadcasting scheme , the total throughput increases as the obus enter the communication range of the rsu , and then decreases to zero as the obus leaves this area . by introducing v2v transmissions as in the proposed approach as well as the non - cooperative approach ,",
    "the total throughput is largely increased . even after the obus completely leaves the rsu area ,",
    "the packets can still be exchanged among the obus and the total throughput is still above zero .",
    "further , by introducing cooperation among obus , the proposed approach reduces the probability of collision and avoids repeated transmissions , relative to the non - cooperative approach , and thus , has a better performance in total throughput .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ service_rate ] shows that , using the proposed cooperative approach , the maximal total throughput is increased by @xmath2 and @xmath187 , respectively , relative to the non - cooperative approach and pure broadcasting approach .",
    "note that as more packets are delivered in the network , the obus become less willing to exchange data and the potential throughput for v2v transmissions decreases .",
    "the total throughput of optimal solution may fall below other methods , and our proposed approach may fall below the non - cooperative approach , especially seen from slot @xmath188 to slot @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ service_rate ] .    in fig .",
    "[ tradeoff ] , we show the sensing - throughput tradeoff by setting different @xmath189 from @xmath0 to @xmath14 in both the non - cooperative approach and the proposed algorithm . as we can see , the value of @xmath189 with the best performance occurs at @xmath190 , which coordinates to our reference value given in ( [ kjdecide2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the best spectrum sensing time @xmath191 can be individually decided by simple numerical solutions . note that even @xmath192 , which means no time is left for v2v transmissions ,",
    "the obus can still receive data from the rsu .",
    "the total possessed packets @xmath193 is above zero for any @xmath194 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ tradeoff ] .    in fig .",
    "[ cr ] , we show the performance of the proposed algorithm with different numbers of cognitive radio channels for v2v transmissions . here , the parameter @xmath189 , representing the number of sensed channels , has been chosen to satisfy equation ( [ kjdecide2 ] ) . as we can see , the number of total possessed packets is highly effected by the cognitive spectrum .",
    "therefore , we can expect a considerable performance improvement , when we apply cr for v2v transmissions , especially in highway scenarios with plenty of spectrum holes .    in fig .",
    "[ scale ] , we show the performance of the proposed algorithm with different network sizes .",
    "note that the total possessed packets increases linearly with the network size .",
    "we have the average possessed packets of each obu is a stable constant with different network sizes , which implies the proposed algorithm is scalable and its performance is stable .",
    "this coordinates with our analysis in section .c , in which we point out that the overhead of the proposed approach is localized . as seen in fig .",
    "[ scale ] , when the network is large ( @xmath195 ) , the total possessed packets of the proposed cooperative approach are increased by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , relative to the non - cooperative approach and the pure broadcasting approach .",
    "when the network becomes smaller , the advantage declines gradually . in extremely sparse networks , as seen in fig .",
    "[ scale ] when @xmath6 converges to @xmath0 , there is few v2v transmission , so that all three p2p approaches degenerate to the pure broadcasting scheme .",
    "note that the centralized optimal solution is shown for up to @xmath196 since it is mathematically intractable for larger networks .    in fig .",
    "[ iteration ] , we show the convergence performance of the proposed approach for networks with @xmath197 and @xmath184 . in section .b , we have proved the convergence of the proposed algorithm .",
    "as we can see , the proposed approach converges in a fast speed with different network sizes .",
    "also , we can see the average possessed packets converge to different values with different network sizes .",
    "on the one hand , denser networks have more chance for v2v transmissions , and thus , brings more missing packets to the obu after sufficient iterations of our proposed algorithm . on the other hand ,",
    "since there is a minimal distance constraint between any two subsequent vehicles , the network can not be infinitely dense , and thus , the converging value of average possessed packets can not be infinitely large . actually , we can see that the gap between @xmath198 and @xmath199 is considerably smaller than the gap between @xmath200 and @xmath199 , which stands for a limited converging value when @xmath6 is infinite .",
    "also , if the iteration number is denoted by @xmath201 , we have he overall complexity of the proposed algorithm is @xmath202 .",
    "since the proposed algorithm is distributed and the overall complexity is shared by all obus , the calculation complexity of each obu is @xmath203 , which increases linearly with the iteration number .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "6 also shows the performance of the proposed algorithm as a function of the calculation complexity of each obu , where the performance converges rapidly to the maximal value as the individual calculation complexity increases .",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the pcd problem in vanets , in which the rsu broadcasts a popular file to the passing obus , but the obus fail to receive some packets due to high speeds and channel fadings . to support reliable transmissions ,",
    "we have proposed a p2p approach based on coalitional graph game to allow the obus to exchange data and complement the missing packets .",
    "specifically , we have introduced a coalitional graph game to model the obus , and have proposed a coalition formation algorithm to implement the p2p approach .",
    "the convergence of the proposed algorithm has been proved and the overhead has be localized for arbitrary network sizes .",
    "also , cr has been utilized to perform the p2p transmissions over unlicensed channels and the sensing - throughput tradeoff has been analyzed , in which the optimal number of sensed channels @xmath189 satisfies @xmath204 , where @xmath14 is the number of potential channels .",
    "the simulation results show that , by introducing cooperation among obus in a coalitional graph game model , the maximal total throughput is increased by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , relative to the non - cooperative approach and the pure broadcasting scheme .",
    "also , for networks in a large scale , the total possessed packets of our proposed algorithm can be increased by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , relative to the non - cooperative approach and the pure broadcasting scheme , respectively .",
