    "ultracold gases are extraordinary systems to investigate fundamental quantum phenomena in a highly controllable environment leading to a wealth of spectacular experimental and theoretical results .",
    "more than a decade ago the experimental production of ultracold mixtures of alkali gases added a new twist to the cold atom field , paving the way towards the study of few- and many - body phenomena absent in a pure homonuclear gas .",
    "few examples include recent experiments with polaronic impurities  @xcite , formation of chemically reactive  @xcite or non - reactive  @xcite ultracold polar molecules , theoretical studies of phase diagrams  @xcite and of pairing in imbalanced fermi systems  @xcite .    in this context",
    ", magnetic feshbach resonances ( fr ) proved to be a powerful and versatile tool to widely tune few - body interactions  @xcite , allowing one to explore in a controlled way regimes from the non interacting ideal behavior to strongly interacting systems .",
    "a fr also offers the possibility to associate pairs of atoms in weakly bound molecular states using time - dependent magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "such molecules have an intrinsic interest due to their long - range nature .",
    "moreover , depending on their spin and spatial structure they can be used as a convenient initial state for producing polar molecules in the ground state via stimulated raman processes  @xcite .",
    "applications based on resonances require an accurate characterization of the scattering dynamics and of the properties of bound states near the dissociation threshold .",
    "fortunately , theory can predict from a small amount of experimental data the location and the width of magnetic resonances and the relevant molecular state properties .",
    "in fact , to date highly quantitative models exist for most alkali isotopic pairs  @xcite . in this work we focus on nak mixtures , a system composed of two species that can be individually cooled to ultracold temperatures .",
    "experiments with na and the fermionic isotope @xmath0k are currently being performed at mit , where heteronuclear fr spectra have been discovered and interpreted based on simplified asymptotic models  @xcite .",
    "magnetic association  @xcite and , more recently , transfer to the ro - vibrational ground state of the dimer have also been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "accurate born - oppenheimer potentials for the ground and the excited states have been built and used to study the adiabatic transfer of a feshbach molecule to the ground ro - vibrational state  @xcite .",
    "however , a comprehensive account of scattering and bound state features for this boson - fermion mixture in the electronic ground state is still lacking .",
    "in addition , near - threshold properties for the boson - boson pairs na@xmath2k and na@xmath3k are still unknown .",
    "this work aims therefore on one side at giving a more complete picture of the feshbach physics of na@xmath0k , and on the other at providing theoretical predictions for the two purely bosonic pairs , for which experiments are on the way in few groups worldwide .",
    "we study both scattering and bound states for an extensive set of hyperfine states , and discuss the experimental implications of our results for interaction control and molecule production .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec_theory ] introduces our theoretical approach and the born - oppenheimer potentials optimization procedure based on known experimental data .",
    "[ sec_results ] presents results and discussions for the boson - fermion and the boson - boson pairs .",
    "few experimental implications of our results are discussed .",
    "a conclusion [ sec_conclusion ] ends this work .",
    "we solve the time - independent schrdinger equation for bound and scattering states in the well - known framework of the close - coupling approach to molecular dynamics .",
    "briefly , in our approach a basis of hund s case ( b ) molecular states is used to expand the total wavefunction at each value of the interatomic distance @xmath5 . in hund s case ( b ) the spin state of the dimer is represented as @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the electronic and nuclear spin angular momentum , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the description of the diatomic is completed by assigning the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quantum numbers relative to the orbital angular momentum @xmath11 of the atoms about their center of mass . in this basis",
    "the electrostatic born - oppenheimer potentials are represented by diagonal matrices with entries the singlet @xmath12 and triplet @xmath13 molecular symmetry adiabatic potential energy curves ( see below ) .",
    "the other interactions relevant for the ultracold regime included in this work are the atomic hyperfine interaction @xmath14 , the anisotropic spin - spin coupling @xmath15 $ } $ ] , and the zeeman interaction energy with the external magnetic field @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron and nuclear spin of the individual atoms and @xmath19 the respective ground - state atomic hyperfine constant for atoms @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 the electron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the fine structure constant and the bohr magneton respectively .",
    "such atomic interactions can be expressed in the molecular hund s case ( b ) computational basis using standard methods of angular momentum algebra ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "bound state calculations are performed using a variable grid approach allowing one to represent over a sufficiently small number of points the rapid oscillations at short range and the long range tail of the dimer wave function  @xcite . for scattering calculations",
    "we use the variable - step gordon propagation or the renormalized numerov algorithm to efficiently solve the coupled - channel schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "once the solution has been built in the computational basis , a frame transformation is applied to express the solution in an asymptotically diagonal representation before using a standard matching procedure to extract the reactance matrix @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we adopt for this work the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 electronic ground state potential of the nak molecule proposed in ref .",
    "a minor modification is made to ensure a continuous and continuously differentiable expression by fine tuning the parameters given in  @xcite .",
    "first , starting from the asymptotic long range @xmath29 expressions we numerically enforce continuity at the switching points @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in addition , smooth damping functions are preferred to the published abrupt change of the potential between the short range repulsive part , the inner well and the long range part .",
    "the resulting continuously differentiable expression is given by @xmath32~\\left[1-\\tanh ( \\beta(r - r_0))\\right]/4   \\nonumber \\\\    & & + u(r)~\\left[1+\\tanh ( \\beta(r - r_i))\\right]~\\left[1-\\tanh ( \\beta(r - r_0))\\right]/4   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + u_{lr}(r)~\\left[1+\\tanh ( \\beta(r - r_i))\\right]~\\left[1+\\tanh ( \\beta(r - r_0))\\right]/4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameterized functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath29 and the switching points @xmath30 and @xmath31 are taken from the work of tiemann and coworkers @xcite .",
    "note there is a typo in the tab .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite where @xmath35 should be replaced by @xmath36 for the @xmath37 constant value .",
    "a value of @xmath38 has been found to be suitable for the control parameter @xmath39 of the damping function for the two electronic states . with an infinite @xmath39 value",
    "the original potential curves are recovered .",
    "we are now in the position to perform close - coupling calculations for different initial channels .",
    "we will conventionally label each asymptotic channel by specifying the separated - atom nak state @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) to which the latter adiabatically correlate as @xmath37 tends to zero .",
    "fr have been experimentally observed in the collision between na in @xmath43 and @xmath0k in @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "we compute the @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath20 in the relevant channels and search for resonances as poles of @xmath20 as a function of magnetic field .",
    "we also search for @xmath1-wave resonances by locating maxima in the partial @xmath1-wave elastic cross sections at a fixed collision energy of @xmath47k .",
    "the observed resonance locations are not reproduced accurately by the original potentials . however , a simple modification consisting in introducing the correction terms @xmath48 ^ 2 , \\mbox { for } i=1,3,\\ ] ] near the bottom of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 electronic potentials enables us to model the experimentally measured spectra .",
    "more specifically , using @xmath49  @xmath50 , @xmath51  @xmath50 and @xmath52  @xmath50 a levenberg - marquardt algorithm is applied to determine two optimal @xmath53 parameters    @xmath54    in the fitting procedure , we included three @xmath55wave resonances at 78.3  g , 88.2  g and 81.6  g and an average position of the @xmath1-wave resonances appearing as a multiplet around 19.19  g @xcite . for the @xmath1-wave calculation we initially neglect the spin - coupling term responsible of the multiplet structure thus avoiding possible incorrect labeling of the closely spaced @xmath1-wave resonances .",
    "after optimization , the resonances positions are theoretically reproduced with a reduced @xmath56 = 0.57 . on a more physical ground ,",
    "the artificial control parameters are usually translated in corresponding singlet and triplet scattering length @xmath57 ( see tab .  [ tab_ast ] ) .",
    "our optimized boson - fermion model can also be used for predicting the properties of boson - boson isotopes . within the born - oppenheimer approximation , which is expected to be accurate for all but for the lightest species  @xcite , it is sufficient to change the value of the reduced mass in the hamiltonian to compute @xmath58 . note however that if the number of bound states in our nominal potentials turned out to be incorrect , the predicted @xmath57 ( and hence the results of the coupled model ) will be systematically shifted .",
    ".singlet and triplet scattering lengths @xmath57 obtained according to our optimized potentials for different nak isotopic pairs . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     experimental observation of the corresponding magnetic spectra",
    "would provide a valuable piece of information to confirm the accuracy of our model for @xmath59 collision in this boson - boson mixture .",
    "we have presented an extensive compendium of the ground state scattering properties of isotopic nak mixtures in an external magnetic field .",
    "our results complement existing theory and experimental data on the boson - fermion pair na@xmath0k . the feshbach resonance locations and strengths",
    "we predict for the boson - boson pairs should be of major interest for experiments in which control of the atom - atom interaction is a requirement .",
    "our spin - resolved analysis of feshbach molecules also provides an important piece of information for designing magnetoassociation and two - photon transfer scheme of feshbach molecules to the absolute ro - vibrational ground state .",
