    "light quark ( @xmath0 ) spectroscopy is very rich , and very tough .",
    "the quarks are highly relativistic in the hadrons they make , the strong coupling constant @xmath1 is very large ( @xmath2 ) , and the @xmath3 quarks have such similar masses that nearly all @xmath4 mesons are mixtures of all three flavours .",
    "this results in a very high density of overlapping states , difficult to disintangle , and even more difficult to understand .",
    "in contrast , the charm ( @xmath5 ) and beauty ( @xmath6 ) quarks are heavy enough so that relativistic problems are not too serious ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath1 is not too large , ( @xmath8 ) , and charmonium @xmath9 and bottomonium @xmath10 states are few and well resolved ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this makes the spectroscopy of @xmath9 and @xmath10 particularly useful for the study of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "this is where all of it began with the 1974 discovery of @xmath11 . from 19741985",
    "a lot of discovery physics in charmonium was done at slac , orsay and desy , but precision was often lacking , except for the vector states which could be directly produced in @xmath12 annihilation . width of triplet p - wave states could not be determined , and except for the ground state , no singlet s- and p - wave states could be successfully identified .",
    "the region above the @xmath13 threshold essentially remained .        during 19902000 ,",
    "the fermilab experiments e760 and e835 exploited the ability of @xmath14 annihilations to make precision measurements of the masses and widths of @xmath15 ( @xmath11 , @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) states , but were not so successful in making equally precise measurements of the singlet state @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , and failed in identifying @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the region above @xmath13 threshold remained _ terra incognita_. for a review see ref . 1 .    during the 1990s ,",
    "the bes detector at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) made important contributions in charmonium spectroscopy , primarily by investing much greater luminosity ( @xmath27 ) then slac+orsay+desy .",
    "they also made some important excursions in the region above the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "more recently , new players have emerged in the field .",
    "the cleo detector at the cesr accelerator at cornell , the belle detector at kek , and the babar detector at pep ii at stanford , are all beginning to produce extremely interesting results .",
    "i am going to describe some of these below . in somewhat more distant future ( 2008  )",
    "we expect new accelerators , bepc ii and fair at gsi , to come online and provide further insight into the physics of this mass region .",
    "the spin - indepedent @xmath28 interaction is well understood in terms of one - gluon exchange , and is very successfully modeled by a coulombic 1/@xmath29 potential . the spin dependence which follows from this",
    "is also accepted .",
    "what is not understood is the the nature of the confinement part of the interaction , which is generally modeled by a scalar potential proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "a crucial test of the lorenz nature of the confinement potential is provided by the measurement of hyperfine or spin - singlet / spin - triplet splittings .",
    "a scalar potential does not contribute to the spin - spin or hyperfine interaction , whereas for a coulombic potential it is a contact interaction . as a consequence hyperfine splitting",
    "is predicted to be finite only for s - wave states , and to be zero for p - wave and higher l - states      no singlet states have so far been identified in bottomonium . in charmonium , however , it has been established for a long time that @xmath30 mev .",
    "it is interesting to determine the size of the hyperfine splitting of @xmath31 states , which sample the confinement region more deeply .",
    "long ago crystal ball@xcite claimed the identification of @xmath24 with @xmath32 mev , leading to @xmath33 mev , which kind of made sense with @xmath34 mev .",
    "most potential model calculations tried to accomodate this ` experimental ' result , although it was not confirmed by any subsequent measurement , and was actually dropped by the pdg meson summary .",
    "the seach for @xmath24 has finally ended .",
    "belle@xcite announced it first in two different decays of large samples of b - mesons .",
    "cleo@xcite and babar@xcite both have identified it in the two - photon fusion reaction , @xmath35 .",
    "the cleo measurement is shown in fig .",
    "the exciting part of these measurements is that @xmath36 mev , which is almost 50 mev larger than the old crystal ball claim , and it leads to a surprisingly small hyperfine splitting , @xmath37 .",
    "it is too early to say whether this can be explained in terms of channel mixing@xcite , or unexpected contribution from the confinement potential .     in two photon formation , and decay into @xmath38.,width=216 ]      as mentioned already , hyperfine splitting is expected to be zero in all except s - wave states if the confinement potential is scalar , as is generally assumed .",
    "thus it is expected that @xmath39 , except for higher order contributions of no more than an mev or two .",
    "unfortunately , while @xmath40@xcite , the @xmath41 has not been firmly identified .",
    "let me however , give you a preview with the statement that both fermilab e835 and cleo are working on the search for @xmath26 .",
    "the e835 experiment is analyzing the reactions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and preliminary results are that while the first reaction does not have a signal for @xmath26 formation@xcite , the second may have .",
    "the cleo team is analyzing @xmath44 but has not presented any results so far [ note : since the conference , cleo has announced its preliminary results with @xmath45 mev@xcite with the consequent @xmath46 mev .",
    "it appears that there is no significant departure from the simple expectation , @xmath47=0 ] .",
    "since the widths for leptonic decays , as well as 3 gluon decays to light hadrons , of both @xmath11 and @xmath16 depend on the wave functions at the origin , pqcd predicts the equality of the ratios of branching ratios @xmath49 this expectation has been extended to ratios of individual hadronic decays , and has led to many measurements by bes and cleo to test it .",
    "the results is that while the sums of all hadronic decays do seem to follow this expectation , and @xmath50 , individual decays show large departures from it , the ratio being as small as 0.2% for @xmath51 decays .",
    "while many exotic theoretical suggestions have been made to explain these deviations , it appears that what we are witnessing is the failure of attempts to stretch pqcd beyond its limits of validity .      for a long time",
    "the parameters listed in the pdg compilation for the three vector states above the @xmath13 threshhold have been based on the r - parameter measurement by the dasp group@xcite , even though none of the other measurements of r agreed with it .",
    "recent measurements by the bes group@xcite have finally allowed us@xcite to make a reliable determination of these parameters .",
    "the result is that the total and leptonic widths of these states have changed by large amounts , e.g. @xmath52 mev , instead of @xmath53 mev .",
    "similar other new results are @xmath54 mev , @xmath55 mev .      despite the fact that the bottomonium @xmath56 system is certainly more amenable to pqcd , we know far less about bottomonium than we know about charmonium .",
    "the @xmath57 , ground state of bottomonium , has not been identified so far .",
    "the vector states @xmath58 and @xmath59 are known but only one hadronic transition from these , @xmath60 has ever been observed .",
    "radiative transitions @xmath61 states have been observed .",
    "no d - states , which are expected to be bound ( see fig .",
    "1 ) have been observed .",
    "no hadronic transition from any @xmath62 states has ever been observed .",
    "recently , cleo had made small gains in both the above problems .",
    "the @xmath63 state has been successfully observed in 4-photon cascade @xmath64 . the mass @xmath65 mev@xcite . in another measurement",
    ", @xmath66 has also been observed@xcite .",
    "i was going to talk about the classical exotics of qcd , the glueballs and hybrids , but because of the request of the conference organizers to talk about pentaquarks , i will simply refer you to my last review of glueballs and hybrids@xcite .",
    "to summarize , no consensus candidates for scalar or tensor glueballs have emerged so far .",
    "candidates for @xmath67 hybrids with exotic @xmath68 have indeed been claimed amid plenty of controversy .",
    "having been released from glueballs and hybrids , i can indulge in another class of exotics .",
    "these are the unexpected , uninvited , and therefore the exotic hadrons which have recently shown up in several hadron spectroscopy experiments .",
    "the first of these was the discovery of narrow ( @xmath69 mev ) @xmath70 resonances with @xmath71 mev , and @xmath72 mev by babar@xcite and cleo@xcite .",
    "these states were expected at higher masses and therefore with large widths .",
    "instead , they show up temptingly just below @xmath73 and @xmath74 thresholds , giving encouragement to molecular enthusiasts .",
    "the second exotic is the discovery by belle@xcite of a narrow resonance in @xmath75 decays , which was quickly confirmed by cdf .",
    "this resonance , dubbed x(3872 ) , has a mass of @xmath76 mev , a width @xmath77 mev , and decays ( it appears almost exclusively ) to @xmath78 .",
    "again , since its mass , width , and decay make it difficult to fit it into the charmonium spectrum , and since @xmath79 mev , it has provided more fodder to @xmath80 molecule enthusiasts . at cleo",
    "we have searched for this state in untagged two photon fusion ( therefore @xmath81 ) and in isr ( initial state radiation ) mediated production , and have established quite stringent upper limits on its population in either production mode@xcite .",
    "i finally come to the hotter than hot topic of ...",
    "the pentaquark story starts with the annoucement by leps at osaka@xcite that there was a significant enhancement in the missing mass spectrum for @xmath82 in the reaction @xmath83 with photons incident on a plastic scintillator ( ch ) target .",
    "the missing mass spectrum was interpreted to indicate a @xmath84 state dubbed @xmath85 , with mass @xmath86 gev , and width @xmath87 mev , with statistical significance of @xmath88 .",
    "if true , the state had strangeness @xmath89 , and had to have at least five quarks .",
    "the pentaquark was born ! in quick succession , clas claimed confirmation in photons incident on deuterium@xcite , and hydrogen@xcite , saphir in @xmath90@xcite , zeus@xcite in @xmath91 and @xmath92 inelastic scattering , hermes@xcite in @xmath93 inelastic scattering , yerevan in @xmath94+propane@xcite , diana@xcite in @xmath95+xenon , svd in @xmath94+si@xcite , and cosy in @xmath96@xcite .",
    "neutrinos were also not left behind , and itep@xcite claimed @xmath85 in @xmath97h@xmath98,d@xmath98,ne data from cern and fnal . in my memory , never before has such a stampede been witnessed !    the theoretical model for @xmath85 which was in vogue is the antidecuplet model of jaffe and wilczek@xcite . according to this model , there should be @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 cascade pentaquarks also .",
    "sure enough , na49@xcite announced the observation of @xmath102 as the @xmath103 pentaquark in the reaction @xmath104 .",
    "going one step further , h1@xcite claimed the observation of a charmed pentaquark @xmath105 in the reaction @xmath106 .",
    "one would think that with so many positive observations there is no doubt that pentaquarks exist .",
    "unfortunately , this is not so .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "the first is illustrated in my table i. the fact is that despite the claimed significance levels up to @xmath107 , a conservative uniform determination of significance , @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath75 are signal and background counts respectively , leads to the fact that none of the significance levels rises to the level of @xmath110 , the criterion used by physical review letters for a claim of observation .",

    "since pentaquarks are so novel and exciting , many more experiments have attempted to find them , but failed .",
