    "electron correlations in quantum - dot structures result in many fascinating effects that can be probed in detail with remarkable experimental control of system parameters.@xcite perhaps one of the most interesting regimes occurs when electrons confined in the dot acquire antiferromagnetic correlations with electrons in the leads , giving rise to the well - known kondo effect.@xcite the simplest realization of this phenomenon in a single quantum dot is characterized by just one low - energy scale , set by the kondo temperature , which controls ( among other features ) the width of a many - body resonance at the fermi energy.@xcite recent experimental@xcite studies of the kondo effect in multiple quantum dots have revealed a complex competition between geometry and correlations , making evident that these structures provide a flexible setting in which to explore much novel physics .    in this context ,",
    "double - quantum - dot arrangements exhibit striking manifestations of kondo physics , with conductance signatures of these effects predicted to show up in realistic experimental setups .",
    "a telling example is the interplay of kondo physics and quantum interference in `` side - coupled '' or `` hanging - dot '' configurations , @xcite leading to a variety of interesting  fano - kondo \" effects .",
    "@xcite a rather unexpected situation arises when a small , strongly interacting `` dot 1 '' is connected to external leads via a large `` dot 2 '' that is tuned to have a single - particle level in resonance with the common fermi energy of the leads.@xcite in this configuration the kondo resonance , which normally has a single peak at the fermi energy , splits into two peaks  a behavior that can be understood as a consequence of interference between the many - body kondo state in dot 1 and a single - particle - like resonance that controls ( or `` filters '' ) its connection to the leads.@xcite the magnitude of the kondo peak splitting is determined by the balance of several important energy scales in the problem : the width and position of the active single - particle level in dot 2 ; the height of the effective single - particle resonance set by the interdot coupling ; and the many - body kondo temperature ( determined by the preceding energy scales in combination with the dot-1 level - position and interaction strength ) .",

    "this interplay reveals itself in the fundamental fermi - liquid properties of the system , such as the variation with magnetic field @xmath0 at zero temperature of the fermi - energy ( @xmath1 ) value of the side - dot spectral function @xmath2 . instead of the usual monotonic decay@xcite of @xmath3 with increasing @xmath0",
    "we find a markedly nonuniversal behavior , where @xmath3 passes through a maximum at a nonzero value of the field .",
    "this effective _ field - enhancement _ of the kondo spectral function is a consequence of the side - dot geometry .",
    "the same behavior can also be understood using an appropriate form of the friedel sum rule , which predicts parameter- and field - dependent phase shifts that impart the unusual nonmonotonicity to the variation of @xmath3 with @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we show that the competition between zeeman splitting of the dot levels and kondo screening results in a dominant exchange - mediated antiferromagnetic coupling of the dots over a range of moderate magnetic fields , before both dots become fully polarized at higher fields . finally , we identify signatures of the aforementioned phenomena in the transport properties . a key result is the generation of _ spin - polarized currents _ through the device , which can be tuned by adjusting gate voltages to achieve _ total polarization . _",
