    "experimental facilities which accurately measure the energy of a photon beam using photon tagging have made possible a new generation of experiments which probe the low - energy structure of nucleons and nuclei .",
    "in particular , photon tagging can be used to measure compton scattering on weakly - bound systems , since it facilitates the separation of elastic and inelastic cross sections . at sufficiently low energy @xmath0",
    "the spin - averaged forward compton scattering amplitude for any nucleus is , in the nuclear rest frame :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the polarization vectors of the initial and final - state photons , @xmath4 is the total charge of the nucleus , and @xmath5 is its total mass . the first term in this series is a consequence of gauge invariance , and is the thomson limit for low - energy scattering on a target of mass number @xmath6 and atomic number @xmath7 . the coefficient of the second term is the sum of the target electric and magnetic polarizabilities , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . the polarizabilities can be separated by going to backward angles , which probes the difference , @xmath10 .",
    "the polarizabilities contain information about the electromagnetic structure of the target .",
    "a number of recent experiments have focused on compton scattering on the proton and on the deuteron .",
    "these experiments have already resulted in a wealth of new data on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the proton electric and magnetic polarizabilities , and might yield information on @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the corresponding neutron quantities . these are basic low - energy hadron parameters which reflect the underlying qcd dynamics . in a simple quark model picture",
    "they contain averaged information about the charge and current distribution produced by the quarks inside the nucleon .    at energies well below the chiral symmetry breaking scale , @xmath15",
    ", the electromagnetic interactions of pions and nucleons can be described systematically using an effective field theory .",
    "this effective field theory , known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath16 ) , reflects the observed qcd pattern of symmetry breaking ; there is an approximate @xmath17 symmetry which is spontaneously broken to @xmath18 ( isospin ) .",
    "this pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to three goldstone bosons which are identified with the pions . in the chiral limit",
    "pions interact only through derivative interactions . a finite pion mass reflects the nonvanishing current quark masses in qcd .",
    "@xmath19 is a useful theory because pions interact only through vertices with a countable number of derivatives and/or insertions of the quark mass matrix ; each power of the pion mass and each derivative count as one power of `` small momenta '' .",
    "therefore @xmath20-matrix elements computed in @xmath19 can be expressed as simultaneous expansions in powers of momenta and pion masses over the characteristic scale of physics that is not included explicitly in the effective theory :    @xmath21    taking @xmath22 to represent a `` small momentum '' : a momentum @xmath23 or a pion mass .",
    "note that the dynamical effects of _ all _ mesons other than the pion are accounted for through local pionic operators . in the purest form of @xmath19 , the coefficients of these operators are fit to one experiment and then used to predict other experiments .",
    "hence @xmath19 is a predictive theory .",
    "the machinery of @xmath19 was originally developed for goldstone boson interactions .",
    "however , it is straightforward to extend the machinery to include single - baryon processes , with the baryons treated as heavy , static objects .",
    "this subject is reviewed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nucleon compton scattering has been studied in @xmath19 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the following results for the polarizabilities were obtained to order @xmath24 :    @xmath25    here we have used @xmath26 for the axial coupling of the nucleon , and @xmath27 mev as the pion decay constant . note that the polarizabilities are _ predictions _ of @xmath19 at this order .",
    "the @xmath28 @xmath19 predictions diverge in the chiral limit because they arise from pion loop effects . in less precise language",
    ", the power counting of @xmath19 implies that polarizabilities are dominated by the dynamics of the long - ranged pion cloud surrounding the nucleon , rather than by short - range dynamics .",
    "the polarizabilities should thus provide a sensitive test of chiral dynamics .    at the next order in the chiral expansion , @xmath29 , there are contributions to the polarizabilities from undetermined parameters which must be fixed independently  @xcite",
    ". these counterterms account for short - range contributions to the nucleon structure .",
    "this higher - order calculation will be discussed further below .",
    "recent experimental values for the proton polarizabilities are @xcite    @xmath30    where the first error is a combined statistical and systematic error , and the second set of errors comes from the theoretical model employed .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath31 extracted from this multi - energy fit is consistent with the venerable baldin sum rule  @xcite .",
    "these values are also in good agreement with the chiral perturbation theory predictions .",
    "the neutron polarizabilities are difficult to obtain experimentally and so the corresponding @xmath19 prediction is not well tested .",
    "a dispersion sum rule can relate the sum of electric and magnetic polarizabilities to an integral of the deuteron photo - absorption cross section ; with model - dependent assumptions about the size of the neutron contribution to the deuteron photo - absorption cross section , it has been found that  @xcite    @xmath32    most direct information on @xmath13 has been obtained by scattering neutrons on a heavy nucleus and examining the cross section as a function of energy .",
    "currently there is much controversy over what result this technique gives for @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the value  ) we have been discussing here . in order to correct for this we have applied the standard 5% correction to obtain @xmath33 s from the experimental results  @xcite . ]    @xmath34    was obtained , which disagrees considerably with the result of the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath35    given this discrepancy , it is important to measure the electromagnetic neutron polarizabilities by other means .",
    "compton scattering on a nuclear target is an obvious candidate .",
    "quasi - free compton scattering by the neutron in a deuteron target was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . with the use of a theoretical model , the polarizability    @xmath36    was extracted .",
    "one difficulty with this extraction of the polarizability by scattering on a nuclear target lies in the absence of a large neutron contribution : for quasi - free scattering the cross section in the forward direction goes as @xmath37 ( where we have neglected the smaller magnetic polarizability ) and is very small .",
    "partly for this reason , attention has turned to other methods of extracting the neutron polarizabilities .",
    "it should be pointed out though that some authors argue that quasi - free photon - neutron scattering deserves renewed study  @xcite .",
    "one alternative to this quasi - free compton scattering is coherent photon scattering on the deuteron . in this case",
    ", the cross section in the forward direction naively goes as :    @xmath38    the sum @xmath39 may then be accessible via its interference with the dominant thomson term for the proton , @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "this is one example of a general argument that the deuteron differential cross section is sensitive to isoscalar combinations of the nucleon polarizabilities .",
    "this means that with experimental knowledge of the proton polarizabilities it may be possible to extract those for the neutron .",
    "coherent compton scattering on a deuteron target has been measured at @xmath41 49 and 69 mev by the illinois group @xcite .",
    "an experiment with tagged photons in the energy range @xmath42 mev is under analysis at saskatoon @xcite , while data for @xmath43 of about 60 mev is being analyzed at lund  @xcite .",
    "there is clearly a need for a consistent theoretical framework in order to interpret this data .",
    "the amplitude for compton scattering on the deuteron involves mechanisms other than compton scattering on the individual constituent nucleons .",
    "hence , extraction of nucleon polarizabilities requires a theoretical calculation of compton scattering on the deuteron that is under control in the sense that it accounts for _ all _ mechanisms to a given order in a systematic expansion in a small parameter .",
    "there exist a few calculations of this reaction in the framework of conventional potential models @xcite .",
    "these calculations yield similar results if similar input is supplied , but typically mechanisms for nucleon polarizabilities and two - nucleon contributions are not treated consistently .",
    "we will see that @xmath19 provides an alternative framework where this drawback can be eliminated .    in few - nucleon systems ,",
    "a complication arises in @xmath19 due to the existence of shallow nuclear bound states and related infrared singularities in @xmath6-nucleon reducible feynman diagrams evaluated in the static approximation  @xcite .",
    "physically , the fundamental problem is that nuclear physics introduces a new mass scale , the nuclear binding energy , which is very small compared to a typical hadronic scale .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty is to adopt a modified power counting scheme in which @xmath19 is used to calculate an effective potential which generally consists of all @xmath6-nucleon irreducible graphs .",
    "the @xmath20-matrix , which includes all reducible graphs as well , is then obtained through iteration by solving a lippmann - schwinger equation  @xcite .",
    "( we will refer to this version of the effective theory as the weinberg formulation . )",
    "to date the weinberg formulation can be carried through rigorously only using finite cutoff regularization  @xcite .",
    "this limitation has spawned an intense theoretical effort geared at formulating an effective field theory for low - lying bound states which is verifiably ( analytically ) consistent in the sense of renormalization  @xcite .",
    "one result of this effort is a new power counting scheme in which all nonperturbative physics responsible for the presence of low - lying bound states arises from the iteration of a single operator in the effective theory , while all other effects , including all higher dimensional operators _ and _ pion exchange , are treated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "( we will refer to this version of the effective theory as the kaplan - savage - wise ( ksw ) formulation . )",
    "this is relevant here because compton scattering on the deuteron has been computed to next - to - leading order in the ksw formulation  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this result and its relation to our calculation .",
    "a comprehensive and up - to - date review of nuclear applications of effective field theories can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compute compton scattering on the deuteron for incoming photon energies of order 100 mev in the weinberg formulation .",
    "we use baryon @xmath19 to compute an irreducible scattering kernel to order @xmath24 , which is then sewn to external deuteron wavefunctions as in fig .",
    "compton scattering on the nucleon is a fundamental ingredient of our calculation .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the power counting scheme specific to the weinberg formulation .",
    "it is important to realize that typical nucleon momenta inside the deuteron are small  on the order of @xmath44 or @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the deuteron binding energy  and consequently , _ a priori _ we expect no convergence problems in the @xmath19 expansion of any low - momentum electromagnetic or pionic probe of the deuteron .",
    "this method has led to fruitful computation of the pion - deuteron scattering length  @xcite , neutral pion photoproduction on the deuteron at threshold  @xcite , as well as @xmath47 radiative capture  @xcite and the solar burning process @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "although in principle we could use wavefunctions computed in @xmath19 , we will consider wavefunctions generated using two modern nucleon - nucleon potentials . in previous computations using this method results are not very sensitive to details of the deuteron wavefunction .",
    "any wavefunction with the correct binding energy gives equivalent results to within the theoretical error expected from neglected higher orders in the chiral expansion .",
    "similar wavefunction independence is found here .",
    "= 6.2 cm    in section  [ sec - bcpt ] we review those aspects of @xmath19 that are directly relevant to our calculation , including the power counting scheme and the relevant operators . in section  [ sec - counting ]",
    "we present the power counting for compton scattering on the @xmath49 system .",
    "we discuss subtleties which arise because of the presence of a new mass scale in the two - nucleon system : the deuteron binding energy .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - calc ] we present our calculation of compton scattering on the @xmath49 system to order @xmath24 in baryon @xmath19 .",
    "we discuss compton scattering on a single nucleon  which has been calculated elsewhere @xcite  and compute the feynman amplitudes which contribute to photon scattering on the two - nucleon system at order @xmath24 in the momentum expansion . in section  [ sec - results ] we present results for differential cross sections for compton scattering on unpolarized deuteron targets .",
    "we discuss higher - order effects and the extent to which a determination of neutron polarizabilities is possible .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - conclusion ] we summarize our work , and identify future directions for the theoretical study of this reaction .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the effective chiral lagrangian underlying our calculations and the corresponding power counting .",
    "precise statements about qcd dynamics at low energies can be made only where a small dimensionless expansion parameter is identified .",
    "this is of course the motivation behind the ongoing intense effort to develop a perturbative theory of nuclear interactions  @xcite .",
    "one class of dimensionless parameters consists of pure numbers , such as a coupling constant associated with a renormalizable interaction , or the inverse of the dimensionality of a group , as in the large-@xmath50 expansion in qcd .",
    "a second class of dimensionless parameters consists of ratios of dimensional quantities which are present in a physical system when there is a clean hierarchy of scales .",
    "effective field theory is the technology which develops a hierarchy of scales into a perturbative expansion of physical observables . in a system with broken symmetries",
    "this technology is especially powerful . when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken there are always massless goldstone modes which dominate the low - energy dynamics .",
    "although the symmetry in question is no longer a symmetry of the vacuum , it remains a symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "moreover , massless goldstone modes only couple derivatively .",
    "hence at energies small relative to the characteristic symmetry breaking scale , the interactions of the goldstone bosons can be ordered in an effective lagrangian which is constrained by chiral symmetry and in which each operator contains a nonvanishing number of derivatives acting on the pion fields .",
    "observables computed from the effective lagrangian are therefore power series in momenta , with the non - analyticities required by perturbative unitarity .    in qcd the chiral @xmath17 symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken and the low - energy effective field theory is @xmath19 .",
    "here we are interested in processes where the typical momenta of all external particles is @xmath51 , so we identify our expansion parameter as @xmath52 .",
    "if the chiral symmetry of qcd were exact this would be the only expansion parameter in @xmath19 .",
    "however , in qcd @xmath53 is softly broken by the small quark masses .",
    "this explicit breaking implies that the pion has a small mass in the low - energy theory .",
    "since @xmath54 is then also a small parameter , we have a dual expansion in @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",
    "we take @xmath22 to represent either a small momentum _ or _ a pion mass . a generic contribution to a matrix element involving the interaction of any number of pions and @xmath6 nucleons",
    "can then be written in the form    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is a renormalization scale , @xmath57 is some non - analytic function , which is assumed to obey @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is a counting index . in general",
    "the full @xmath60 is the sum of a set of feynman diagrams in a quantum field theory .",
    "it is straightforward to arrive at a general formula for @xmath59 by considering the momentum - space structure of generic feynman rules  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider only irreducible subdiagrams .",
    "these are graphs in which the energies flowing through all internal lines are of @xmath61 .",
    "the issue of calculating the full matrix element for the process of interest from this kernel will be taken up shortly . in irreducible diagrams we have the following counting rules :    * a nucleon propagator contributes @xmath62 ; * a pion propagator contributes @xmath63 ; * each derivative or power of the pion mass at a vertex contributes @xmath22 ; * each loop integral contributes @xmath29 ; * each delta function of four - momentum conservation contributes @xmath64 .    in this way , we find that a diagram with @xmath6 nucleons , @xmath65 loops , @xmath66 separately connected pieces , and @xmath67 vertices of type @xmath68 gives  @xcite    @xmath69    where the so - called index of the interaction @xmath68 is    @xmath70    with @xmath71 the sum of the number of derivatives or powers of @xmath45 and @xmath72 the number of nucleon fields .",
    "since pions couple to each other and to nucleons through either derivative interactions or quark masses , there is a lower bound on the index of the interaction : @xmath73 .",
    "hence the leading _ irreducible _ graphs are tree graphs ( @xmath74 ) with the maximum number of separately connected pieces ( @xmath75 ) , and with vertices with @xmath76 . higher - order graphs ( with larger powers of @xmath59 ) are perturbative corrections to this leading effect . in this way ,",
    "a perturbative series is generated by increasing the number of loops @xmath65 , decreasing the number of connected pieces @xmath66 , and increasing the number of derivatives , pion masses and/or nucleon fields in interactions .",
    "how is this analysis altered in the presence of an electromagnetic field ?",
    "photons couple via the electromagnetic field strength tensor and by minimal substitution .",
    "this has the simple effect of replacing a derivative by a factor of the charge @xmath77 .",
    "this introduces a second expansion , in the small electromagnetic coupling @xmath78 .",
    "since we will be working at a fixed order in the expansion in @xmath79 ( leading order ) , it is convenient to enlarge the definition of @xmath71 to include powers of @xmath77 as well , thus continuing to classify interactions according to the index @xmath80 defined by ( [ deltai ] ) .    with the power counting scheme established , the next step is to construct the effective lagrangians labelled by the interaction index @xmath81 .",
    "the technology that goes into building an effective lagrangian and extracting the feynman rules is standard by now and presented in great detail in @xcite .",
    "the pion triplet is contained in a matrix field    @xmath82    where @xmath83 mev is the pion decay constant . under @xmath84",
    ", @xmath85 transforms as @xmath86 and @xmath87 as @xmath88 ; here @xmath65(@xmath89 ) is an element of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , and @xmath92 is defined implicitly .",

    ", it plays no dynamical role : nucleons are non - relativistic objects in the processes we are interested in .",
    "the field @xmath93 can be treated as a heavy field of velocity @xmath105 in which on - mass - shell propagation through @xmath106 has been factored out . in the rest frame of the nucleon , the velocity vector @xmath107 .",
    "the spin operator is denoted by @xmath108 , and in the nucleon rest frame @xmath109 .    with these ingredients , it is straightforward to construct the effective lagrangian , conveniently ordered according to the index @xmath81 of eq .",
    "( [ deltai ] ) ,    @xmath110    the leading - order lagrangian is    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is an arbitrary ( non - derivative ) hermitian operator , and @xmath26 and @xmath113 are parameters . the sub - leading terms are contained in    @xmath114[(1+{\\kappa _ v}){f_{\\mu\\nu } } + \\frac{1}{2}({\\kappa_s}-{\\kappa_v})tr{f_{\\mu\\nu}}])n + \\ldots , \\label{l1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are parameters related to the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton , @xmath117 , and neutron , @xmath118 . in sub - subleading order ,    @xmath119    where the first term is from the anomaly , with @xmath120 , and",

    "likewise , terms in @xmath127 do not appear in compton scattering to the order that we are working .",
    "note , finally , that the @xmath128 isobar can be introduced in a manner analogous to the nucleon field .",
    "the delta - nucleon mass difference @xmath129 is not much larger than our @xmath22 , so integrating out the delta may worsen the convergence of the low - energy expansion considerably . of course , the effects of the delta still appear in the effective theory constructed above , via their inclusion in counterterms , but keeping an explicit delta shifts these effects to lower orders in the expansion . for simplicity , in this initial calculation we do not include the delta .",
    "the power counting of chiral perturbation theory summarized above works very well for processes involving one or zero nucleons .",
    "a non - trivial new element enters the effective theory when we consider systems of more than one nucleon @xcite .",
    "because nucleons are heavy , contributions from intermediate states that differ from the initial state only in the kinetic energy of nucleons are enhanced by infrared quasi - divergences .",
    "this is linked to the existence of small energy denominators @xmath130 , which generate contributions @xmath131 larger than would be expected from eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) . however , this is not really either a surprise or a problem .",
    "( [ nu ] ) was derived by assuming that all nucleon propagators scale as @xmath132 .",
    "this is correct for irreducible subdiagrams , which do not contain intermediate states with small energy denominators . in an @xmath6-nucleon system which is not subject to any external probes these diagrams are @xmath6-nucleon irreducible diagrams , the sum of which we call the potential @xmath133 .",
    "( see e.g. the left - hand graph of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ) to obtain the full two - nucleon green s function these irreducible graphs are iterated using the free two - nucleon green s function , which can , of course , have a small energy denominator which does not obey the @xmath19 power - counting .",
    "this iteration gives contributions to the two - nucleon green s function such as the graph shown on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "when we consider external probes with momenta of order @xmath22 , the sum of irreducible diagrams forms a kernel @xmath134 for the process of interest . the full green s function for the reaction",
    "is then found by multiplying this kernel @xmath134 by two - particle green s functions in which the two - particle propagators with small energy denominators may appear .",
    "= 3.5 cm    in the case of compton scattering on the two - nucleon system the formal version of these statements is as follows .",
    "the two - particle green s function , @xmath135 , is constructed from the two - nucleon - irreducible interaction @xmath133 , and the free two - nucleon green s function @xmath136 , via    @xmath137    since @xmath133 is two - particle irreducible we may perform a chiral power counting on it as per eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) .",
    "such a potential has been constructed up to @xmath138 , in refs .",
    "@xcite . that work employed cutoff regularization , and the schrdinger equation",
    "was solved to obtain the @xmath49 wave function .",
    "fits to deuteron properties and scattering data up to laboratory energies of 100 mev were obtained for three different cutoff parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , the quality of the fit is not as good as that of phenomenological models .",
    "full consistency can be achieved by treating both the kernel for the interaction with external probes and the @xmath49 potential in the same framework .",
    "however , here we will follow a hybrid approach : we will calculate the kernel in @xmath19 but use several `` realistic '' potential models to calculate the two - particle green s function .    to calculate compton scattering on the two - nucleon system we must also identify the two - nucleon irreducible kernel , @xmath139 , for the process @xmath140 .",
    "again , the power - counting of eq .",

    "however , even if @xmath143 and @xmath133 _ are _ consistently constructed this calculation is not _",

    "indeed , at low photon energies the contribution ( [ eq : resonance ] ) , known as the resonance contribution to compton scattering , is crucial to a correct understanding of the reaction . in particular , without it the thomson limit amplitude for compton scattering on the deuteron will not be recovered . in this low - energy region",
    "the power - counting of eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) does not apply to @xmath139 , since graphs in @xmath139 with two - nucleon intermediate states ( eq . ( [ eq : resonance ] ) ) can lead to violations of the power - counting via the same infrared quasi - divergences discussed above .",
    "however , if the energy of the probe is larger ( @xmath148 ) it is valid to look at the contributions @xmath149 using the power - counting of eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) . hence at higher photon energies it is completely correct to treat this resonance contribution only perturbatively in the @xmath22 expansion .",
    "in other words , as we move into the energy region which is well above the poles of the green s function @xmath135 , it becomes reasonable to use a perturbative expansion for @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : resonance ] ) , rather than one which retains its full structure .",
    "arguments such as these lead us to identify two regimes for compton scattering on nuclei , depending on the relation of the energy of the photonic probe , @xmath0 , to the typical nuclear binding scale @xmath150 :    1 .   @xmath151 . in this region",
    "the power - counting of eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) is not valid , since the external probe momentum flowing through the nucleon lines is of order @xmath152 , rather than order @xmath22 .",

    "the power counting of eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) is valid , since in all irreducible graphs a photon energy of order @xmath22 flows through the nucleon lines .",
    "these two regimes were identified by friar and tomusiak in a discussion of the role of low - energy theorems for threshold pion photoproduction on nuclei  @xcite .",
    "they were also discussed in the work of chen _ et al .",

    "@xcite compton scattering on the deuteron was computed to the same order discussed here , one order beyond leading non - vanishing order .",
    "however , there the calculation was performed in the ksw formulation of two - nucleon effective field theory , rather than in the weinberg formulation .",
    "an advantage of ksw power - counting is that the effective field theory moves smoothly between @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "ksw power - counting is valid for nucleon momenta @xmath156 mev .",

    "finally , in order to see the size of the effects we can expect in an @xmath226 calculation of this process , we arbitrarily include two terms which contribute to the @xmath226 calculation : counterterms which shift the values of the nucleon polarizabilities from the @xmath28 result .      in figures  [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] below we display our results at 49 , 69 , and 95 mev . for comparison we have included the calculation at @xmath205 , where the second contribution in eq .",

    "this is particularly apparent at @xmath264 , where the @xmath205 amplitude is , in fact , energy - independent , and we can see that the polarizabilities play a significant role in suppressing the forward differential cross section as the photon energy increases .",

    "this gives :    = 5.5 cm    @xmath268    to estimate the size of effects arising from the dynamical nature of the nucleons in the intermediate @xmath49 state we have rewritten the two - nucleon propagator as :    @xmath269    for the case of low - energy photon - deuteron scattering the leading contribution to the delta - function piece will be @xmath270 .",
    "thus , we may evaluate the leading part of the delta - function piece of @xmath271 as a two - dimensional integral over the solid angle @xmath272 :    @xmath273    naively this expression contributes to @xmath274 at an order @xmath275 relative to the leading contribution .",
    "however , note that in fact this part of @xmath271 is suppressed beyond the level indicated by this straightforward counting , since factors of the deuteron wave function at momenta of order @xmath259 enter . ultimately if @xmath276 these factors drastically reduce this piece of @xmath271 , rendering it quite small .",
    "however , at @xmath277 mev , contributions such as ( [ eq : oq2.5piece ] ) can be sizeable  .    a contribution to compton scattering on the deuteron similar to that of ( [ eq : oq2.5piece ] ) exists for the @xmath180-channel pole graph for photon - nucleon scattering .",
    "the contribution of that graph to the amplitude is , in fact , real , and the loop momentum that contributes to that process is , at lowest order , @xmath278 .",
    "in fact , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite it is the contribution from these momenta in the @xmath180-channel pole graph that facilitates the ( approximate ) recovery of the thomson limit for low - energy photon scattering off the deuteron .",
    "when these two contributions are added to the amplitude @xmath274 calculated above we obtain the results shown in figure  [ fig - nnadded ] .",
    "there we have shown results for @xmath205 and @xmath28 , both with and without these mechanisms , at laboratory photon energies of 49 , 69 , and 95 mev .",
    "clearly the contribution from these two - nucleon states with relative momenta of order @xmath259 plays a significant role if @xmath279 mev .",
    "since these effects are higher - order in our power counting this apparently implies a breakdown of our approach at @xmath280 mev .",
    "however , we observe that once this @xmath49 intermediate - state contribution is added the agreement with the experimental data at 49 mev is really quite good .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible to devise an alternative power counting for this regime , where an accounting is made not only of the way the scales @xmath0 , @xmath231 and @xmath45 appear in the amplitude , but also of the role played by the additional scale @xmath259 .",
    "= 9.5 cm    however , this low - energy regime is not a primary concern in our work here .",
    "we have instead focused on @xmath276 , since it is there that the best opportunity to extract the neutron polarizability seems to lie .",
    "our results show that as the photon energy is increased the contribution from these on - shell @xmath49 intermediate states becomes significantly less , because of the suppression from the deuteron wave function discussed above . by the time",
    "@xmath281 mev is reached this higher - order effect is small : in fact , as we shall see below , it is significantly smaller than other higher - order effects which could be included .",
    "we have also performed the calculation of the photon - deuteron differential cross section with a wave function found by solving the schrdinger equation with the nijm93 potential  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of @xmath28 calculations with the two different potentials at 49 , 69 , and 95 mev is shown in figure  [ fig - potcomp ] .",
    "the results with the nijm93 wave function are in general a little higher than those found with obepq . however , the cross sections only differ at the 10% level .",
    "further investigation shows that much of this discrepancy is due to inconsistency between the physics of pion range in the @xmath49 potentials employed and the two - nucleon compton scattering mechanisms involving pions which we have calculated . in computing these graphs we employed the @xmath282 vertex from the lowest - order chiral lagrangian and the axial coupling constant @xmath26 .",
    "therefore in essence we have used a @xmath282 coupling in these graphs given by the goldberger - treiman relation : @xmath283    in contrast , the values of @xmath284 employed in the two @xmath49 potentials from which we obtain our deuteron wave functions are : @xmath285 effects beyond the leading - order result for @xmath286 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gt ] ) , will enter at orders beyond those we have considered here and presumably move our @xmath286 towards the values ( [ eq : fpinn ] ) .",
    "although such changes in @xmath286 would be higher order in the chiral expansion , we note that in certain circumstances they may enter raised to the fourth power in the photon - deuteron cross section , and so might play a non - negligible role .",
    "a fully consistent resolution of this issue must await the use of an accurate @xmath287pt deuteron wave function in the calculation of deuteron compton scattering . to address the issue in our current calculation we multiplied the strength of our two - nucleon mechanisms by two different factors in the calculations employing the two different deuteron wave functions . in this way the two - nucleon current is made consistent with the value of the @xmath282 coupling employed in the nijm93 and obepq potentials .",
    "we stress that the two potentials still do not have the same strength at pion range , but at least once such a scaling is employed the @xmath49 mechanisms for compton scattering are always consistent with the one - pion exchange used to obtain the deuteron wave function .",
    "this partial remediation of the inconsistency reduced the wave function sensitivity to about 5% everywhere .",
    "this suggests to us that the difference between the results obtained with the two different wave functions does not represent a true sensitivity to short - distance dynamics , but rather a need to treat the dynamics of pion range in the same way in all pieces of the calculation .    as we shall see , this wave - function dependence is smaller than other effects which are higher - order in the chiral expansion of the kernel",
    ". therefore at this stage we are not concerned about it .",
    "ultimately we would like to perform this calculation of compton scattering on the deuteron with a deuteron wave function calculated consistently from an @xmath49 potential derived within the @xmath19 framework  @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to test the sensitivity of our calculation to higher - order effects we added a small piece of the @xmath226 amplitude for compton scattering off a single nucleon .",
    "specifically , we modified the invariant functions @xmath216 and @xmath288 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : as ] ) to include additional terms .",
    "the additional terms are    @xmath289    we emphasize that these are only two of a number of new terms which will appear in the single - nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath290 at @xmath226 . furthermore , a number of additional two - body mechanisms must be included in @xmath291 in any @xmath226 calculation of compton scattering on the deuteron .",
    "nevertheless , here we calculate the differential cross section with the terms ( [ eq : deltaa1 ] ) and ( [ eq : deltaa2 ] ) in order to get a feel for the sensitivity of our result to the presence of such higher - order terms .",
    "the addition of ( [ eq : deltaa1 ] ) and ( [ eq : deltaa2 ] ) change the polarizabilities in the calculation to @xmath292 where @xmath293 and @xmath294 are the @xmath28 values of eq .",
    "( [ eq : betaoq3 ] ) .",
    "two calculations were performed . in the first , @xmath295 and @xmath296",
    "were chosen so that the total polarizabilities ( [ mockpol ] ) were equal to the `` experimental '' values ( [ protpolexpt ] ) , ( [ neutpolexpt1 ] ) , and ( [ neutpolexpt2 ] ) .",
    "the second calculation involved a more dramatic change in the polarizabilities : @xmath295 and @xmath296 were chosen so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 were equal to the @xmath226 values of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alphaoq4 ] ) and ( [ eq : betaoq4 ] ) . in either case",
    "@xmath297 is relatively small , while @xmath298 is not large for `` experimental '' values , but is significant for the @xmath226 values .",
    "the results of these two calculations for the two photon energies @xmath279 mev and @xmath258 mev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - polcomp49 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - polcomp95 ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    in both cases we see that , just as one would expect , the cross section at 95 mev is much more sensitive to these @xmath226 terms than the cross section at 49 mev .",
    "it is not surprising that the calculation with @xmath226 polarizabilities exhibits a larger change than that with `` experimental '' values . continually increasing @xmath299 at approximately constant @xmath300 decreases the cross section at forward angles and increases it at back angles .",
    "in fact , it seems that if @xmath299 is sufficiently large then the character of the cross section at 95 mev can change completely from forward peaked to backward peaked .    as a final exercise ,",
    "[ fig - neutronfiddle49 ] and [ fig - neutronfiddle95 ] exhibit the differential cross sections found at 49 and 95 mev if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are held fixed at their @xmath28 values , while @xmath14 and @xmath13 are varied with @xmath301 constrained to the central value of eq .",
    "( [ neutpolexpt1 ] ) .",
    "these plots suggest that at backward angles and higher energies the differential cross section is quite sensitive to @xmath302 .",
    "however , significant change in the 95 mev results presented here from those obtained at @xmath28 mandates a cautious interpretation . at the same time that the cross section at 95 mev is more sensitive to polarizabilities than at lower energies",
    ", it is also more sensitive to @xmath226 corrections . in our view",
    ", a full @xmath226 calculation in @xmath19 is necessary if any attempt is to be made to extract the neutron polarizability from the saskatoon data within this framework .",
    "we have calculated the differential cross section for compton scattering on the deuteron in @xmath19 up to @xmath28 .",
    "we have found :    @xmath303 reasonable agreement with the data at 49 mev . at this energy",
    "@xmath28 corrections are not large compared to the leading @xmath205 result , and @xmath226 terms seem to be even smaller .",
    "there is little dependence on the wavefunction used .",
    "however , as anticipated , certain terms necessary to restore the thomson , zero - energy , limit for photon - deuteron scattering are important at this lower energy .",
    "once they are added to our calculation agreement with data is good .",
    "@xmath303 good agreement with the data at 69 mev . at this energy",
    "the convergence appears to be good .",
    "this suggests that @xmath19 at @xmath28 is providing reasonable neutron and two - nucleon contributions .    @xmath303",
    "that the polarizability approximation should not be used in the calculation of the differential cross section at 95 mev , since truncating the photon - nucleon amplitude at order @xmath215 results in a significant change in the photon - deuteron differential cross section for forward angles .",
    "@xmath303 wave function dependence on the order of 10% in the differential cross section .",
    "our calculations suggest that much of this dependence would be removed if the physics of pion range were the same in both wave functions and in the computation of the kernel .",
    "@xmath303 a prediction at 95 mev which is , however , plagued by considerable uncertainties .",
    "convergence is slow at this energy , as indicated by the relative size of both the full set of @xmath28 corrections and a partial set of @xmath226 corrections .",
    "the cross section tends to come out somewhat smaller than at lower energies , in particular in the backward directions , although the full @xmath226 amplitude is likely to be somewhat bigger at back angles .",
    "it seems that a more stringent test of @xmath19 at these energies  including aspects of neutron structure beyond the @xmath28 `` pion cloud '' picture  will have to wait for a next - order calculation .",
