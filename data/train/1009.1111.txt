    "consideration of such a weak inter - layer coupling does not appreciably change the estimated exchange constants and the in - plane spin dynamics .",
    "an estimation of the spin stiffness constant using a renormalized classical approximation for the correlation length shows that both fermion induced moment reduction , and landau damping can sufficiently renormalize the stiffness constant ( see appendix a ) . in appendix b",
    "we have considered the effects of the weak inter - layer exchange coupling @xmath209 using the modified spin wave theory .",
    "for @xmath240 the mean field neel temperature @xmath210 and the mean field ising transition temperature @xmath63 become very close .",

    "v , despite the suppression of the actual transition temperature due to various fluctuation mechanisms , the magnetic and the ising correlation lengths remain sizable up to the mean - field transition temperatures . in the temperature regime @xmath241 , there are three - dimensional antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",

    "this ratio is of course material dependent . for weak inter - layer coupling of ref .  , this ratio is @xmath243 , and magnetic fluctuations are indeed quasi - two dimensional .",
    "finally our discussion regarding the effect of itinerant electrons is most pertinent to the parent systems , but is consistent with the experimental observation of similar low - energy anisotropic responses in the carrier - doped iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "we have addressed the spin dynamics in the paramagnetic phase of a two dimensional @xmath0 antiferromagnet on a square lattice at a finite temperature , using modified spin wave theory . within the modified spin wave theory",
    "we have identified a mean field ising transition temperature @xmath115 , below which the @xmath68 symmetry of the square lattice is spontaneously broken . in the ising ordered phase",
    "the system demonstrates short range @xmath1 or @xmath80 antiferromagnetic order . in order to systematically understand the finite temperature spin - dynamics in the paramagnetic phase of iron pnictides , we have described the fermionic contributions and self - interaction effects of the order parameter fields within a ginzburg - landau framework .",
    "we have found that the fermion contribution and the self - interaction effects can considerably decrease the neel and the ising transition temperatures from their corresponding mean field values .",
    "however the correlation lengths of the magnetic and ising order parameters can remain appreciable up to the mean field transition temperatures .",
    "based on this assumption , we have fitted the experimental data of ref .  , using our theoretical results .",
    "the calculated anisotropic features of the spin response are compatible with experiments for different frequencies .",
    "finally , our calculations of the spin fluctuations at high energies should help understand future experiments .",
