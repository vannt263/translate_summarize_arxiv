    "magnetoresistance has long been used as a tool to study the fermi surface of metals @xcite .",
    "the observation of quantum oscillations provides a measure of the cross - sectional area of closed pockets ( due to the quantization of the landau levels ) .",
    "the background magnetoresistance also contains information about all the electronic orbits induced by the magnetic field .",
    "for example , a transverse magnetoresistance saturating in high field can be evidence for the presence of closed orbits , while a magnetoresistance that increases quadratically with field can indicate open orbits .",
    "a number of effects can complicate this picture and one such is magnetic breakdown , a concept first introduced to explain a giant orbit observed in magnesium @xcite . because of the periodic potential in a crystal , small gaps in the dispersion sometimes open up at the brillouin zone edge , splitting the fermi surface into distinct sections . in low magnetic fields ,",
    "electrons traverse the fermi surface under the action of the magnetic field and bragg scatter at the brillouin zone edge . in a sufficiently strong magnetic field it is possible for an electron to tunnel from one segment of the fermi surface to another @xcite .",
    "this is because in high magnetic field , mixing of states between different pieces of the fermi surface can increase the likelihood of magnetic breakdown , so that the resulting orbit more closely resembles that which would be obtained in the absence of the periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the presence of magnetic breakdown presents a challenge for the simulations of magnetoresistance .",
    "this is because at the points on the brillouin zone edge intersected by the fermi surface ( points which we call magnetic breakdown junctions ) there is a probability @xmath0 for magnetic breakdown to occur and this is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the characteristic breakdown field ; the problem is that under usual experimental conditions @xmath0 is _ between _ 0 and 1 .",
    "thus there is a hierarchy of complex trajectories that must be summed to account for all possible contributions to the conductivity in which magnetic breakdown either does or does not occur at each magnetic breakdown junction .",
    "if a quasiparticle crosses @xmath3 magnetic breakdown junctions , one has to consider @xmath4 possible trajectories with their correct probabilistic weightings , and this complicates a direct computation of magnetoresistance since one has to sum over trajectories with arbitrarily long path lengths and hence arbitarily large values of @xmath3 .    in order to calculate how magnetic breakdown can change the connectivity of the orbits @xcite , and",
    "thus the resistivity , falicov and sievert in 1965 provided a model @xcite that generalised the chambers path integral method @xcite to include magnetic breakdown at a finite number of points .",
    "this was used to evaluate the magnetoresistance in a number of model fermi surfaces , although the calculations were performed numerically .",
    "more recently , the problem of the effect of magnetic breakdown on the magnetoresistance in a network of coupled orbits was treated analytically @xcite , though the focus of this work was on interlayer transport .",
    "this is because the newer calculations are motivated by recent experiments on quasi - two - dimensional organic metals @xcite in which magnetotransport experiments have been particularly illuminating @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the techniques developed in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) to derive an analytical expression for the in - plane components of the resistivity tensor in the falicov - sievert model .",
