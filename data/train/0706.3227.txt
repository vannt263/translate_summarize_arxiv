    "hadron production on nuclear targets is strongly influenced by the presence of cold and hot nuclear matter .",
    "the most spectacular effects is jet quenching in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath0 ) collisions @xcite , namely , the suppression of hadron production at large transverse momentum compared to a suitably scaled cross section in proton - proton collisions .",
    "this phenomenon is widely used as a tool to explore the properties of the hot qcd medium produced in heavy - ion collisions @xcite , and as evidence for the creation of a novel state of matter at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , possibly the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "hadron suppression has also been observed in lepton - nucleus ( @xmath1 ) @xcite and hadron - nucleus ( @xmath2 ) collisions @xcite , where one does not expect the formation of an extended hot medium . in this case",
    ", the target nucleus itself ( cold nuclear matter ) induces the observed suppression of hadron production , which i will refer to as `` cold hadron quenching '' , or cold quenching in short .",
    "nuclear effects in cold nuclear matter can be classified as initial - state or final - state depending on whether they happen before or after the hard collision which generates the hard probe .",
    "final state ( fs ) effects can be isolated in semi - inclusive hadron production in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "hadron suppression in these collisions @xcite is typically attributed to radiative energy loss of the struck quark or to nuclear absorption of a colorless prehadron , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "initial state ( is ) effects can be experimentally isolated in drell - yan processes in @xmath2 collisions @xcite , and they are attributed to nuclear shadowing or radiative energy loss of the incoming parton @xcite . in large-@xmath3 hadron production in @xmath2 collisions",
    "both is and fs effects are present , and they can not be easily disentangled .",
    "they give rise to a host of interesting effects .",
    "they modify the shape of midrapidity hadron @xmath3 spectra , slightly suppressing it at small @xmath4 gev and enhancing it at intermediate 2 gev @xmath5 gev ; this is known as cronin effect @xcite .",
    "an extensive study of the rapidity dependence of the cronin effect in deuteron - gold ( @xmath6 ) collisions at rhic has shown an interesting evolution of the cronin effect : the cronin enhancement grows at backward rapidity @xmath7 @xcite ; however , at forward rapidity @xmath8 , the spectrum is suppressed up to large @xmath3 @xcite , a trend confirmed also at lower energy collisions @xcite . the forward rapidity suppression has been widely interpreted as evidence for the onset of the color glass condensate , a universal state of highly saturated quark and gluons in the nuclear wave function @xcite .",
    "however , explanations in terms of is energy loss and higher - twist shadowing @xcite , leading - twist shadowing @xcite , sudakov suppression @xcite or fs parton recombination @xcite have been equally successful in describing the data .",
    "the rise of the cronin effect at backward rapidity is more difficult to understand @xcite .",
    "explanations in terms of is anti - shadowing @xcite or saturation @xcite have been proposed .",
    "finally , recent phenix data on neutral pion production in @xmath6 collisions at midrapidity suggest a small suppression of midrapidty @xmath9 at @xmath10 gev @xcite . it can not be explained by the emc effect , which is effective at @xmath11 gev @xcite , but may accommodate a small final state energy loss of order 10% @xcite .",
    "a consistent interpretation of this wealth of experimental data requires a deep understanding of is and fs interactions at the parton and hadron level , and the development of a unified computational framework @xcite . as a contribution to this program , in this paper i will analyze phenomenologically the contribution of final state interactions to hadron production in @xmath2 and @xmath0 collisions , and",
    "i will show that it is indeed non negligible in the whole backward rapidity hemisphere up to rhic energy . at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "it will be important only at very backward rapidity @xmath12 . in section  [ sec : lo ] , i will review the kinematics of hadron production at leading order ( lo ) in perturbative qcd for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and nucleon - nucleon collisions ( nn ) , and build a dictionary that relates the kinematic variables used in the 2 cases . in section  [ sec : phasespaces ] , i will compare the nn and dis phase spaces at present and future experiments in terms of either set of variables , to understand in detail the relevance of nn to dis and viceversa . in section  [ sec : coldjetquenching ] , i will use the developed kinematic dictionary to show the extent to which present @xmath1 experimental data can give information on final state cold nuclear matter effects in @xmath2 and @xmath0 collisions ( collectively , @xmath13 collisions ) .",
    "then , i will use an energy loss model tuned to @xmath1 data to estimate cold quenching in @xmath2 collisions for midrapidity hadrons at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and at fermilab ( fnal ) , and at various rapidities at rhic .",
    "a comparison of fs and is effects will be discussed in section  [ sec : isvsfs ] , and my conclusions reported in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "considering parton and hadron production at lo in nn collisions and dis collisions , it is easy to provide an explicit dictionary translating between the variables traditionally used in the analysis of the 2 processes .",
    "i will start by discussing the kinematics of parton and hadron production in nn collisions in the center - of - mass frame ( c.m.f . ) .",
    "i will then suitably identify the dis kinematics in terms of nn variables , and derive the dictionary .",
    "i will work in the framework of collinear factorization in pqcd , and use light - cone coordinates throughout this discussion : for any 4-vector @xmath14 i write @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the plus- and minus - momenta and @xmath17 the transverse momentum .",

    "therefore , based on the observed suppression of hadron production in lepton - nucleus dis @xcite at low @xmath20 , and on the kinematic analogy between dis and nn collisions discussed in the previous sections , we can expect non - negligible hadron suppression due to fs interactions in cold nuclear matter also in @xmath2 and @xmath0 collisions .",

    ", the hard interaction is well localized inside the nucleus , and the nucleons act incoherently as targets @xcite .",
    "the process evolves in time as follows , see fig .",
    "[ fig : isfs ] . first the electron ( or a parton belonging to the proton ) penetrates the nucleus , and undergoes a localized hard collisions .",
    "then , a `` final - state '' system of 1 electron and 1 parton ( or 2 partons ) is produced , with both particles essentially traveling along the beam direction , even for rapidity values far from the center of mass rapidity in the target hemisphere ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "later on the final state partons hadronize and one of the produced hadrons is detected .",
    "the time scale on which hadronization starts after the hard interaction is not at present well known @xcite ; it may be as small as the nuclear radius @xcite , in which case the hadronization process would start in the medium .",
    "nuclear medium effects may be classified as initial state ( is ) effects on particles before the hard interactions , or final state ( fs ) effects on particles created after the hard interaction . in the case of @xmath1 collisions , electromagnetic reinteractions of the incoming or outgoing lepton",
    "are suppressed compared to the strong fs reinteraction of the parton and hadronizing system . for @xmath2 collisions one needs in principle to account for both is and fs interactions @xcite .         except at very forward rapidity",
    ", i will assume fs and is effects in @xmath2 collisions to be factorizable because of the large rapidity difference between the is and fs partons induced by the hard scattering .",
    "then , i will explore the possible size of fs effects on single inclusive hadron production . differently from @xmath1 collisions ,",
    "the proton projectile interacts with the nucleons along its trajectory .",
    "the hard parton produced in the hard collision starts propagating at nearly the speed of light in the same direction but slightly behind the projectile proton .",
    "the time scale for parton production , @xmath22 is much smaller than the time scale for soft particle production in proton - nucleon collisions , @xmath23 .",
    "hence , we may assume the nuclear medium traversed by the produced parton in @xmath2 collisions to have approximately the same properties as the cold nuclear matter which would be traversed in @xmath1 collisions , i.e. , the target nucleus itself . with this in mind",
    ", we may assume final state hadron quenching effects to be comparable in the 2 cases .",
    "nuclear modifications of hadron production in @xmath1 collisions are typically studied in terms of the hadron multiplicity ratio @xmath25 i.e. , the single hadron multiplicity on a target of mass number @xmath26 normalized to the multiplicity on a deuteron target .",
    "then , we can use the dictionary and plot @xmath27 measured in @xmath1 collisions as a function of the kinematic variables @xmath3 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this will give a rough estimate of final state effects in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldquenchexp ] , and the procedure used is discussed below .",
    "data on @xmath30 are usually binned in either @xmath31 , @xmath20 or @xmath32 . except for the emc data , they are presented alongside the average value of the unbinned variables . for hermes data @xcite",
    ", i used the experimentally measured values of the dis variables to compute the equivalent @xmath3 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for emc data @xcite",
    ", i used a computation of the average unbinned variables from the gibuu monte carlo generator @xcite , which was shown to well reproduce the corresponding measurements at hermes @xcite .",
    "another complication arises from the fact that emc data have been obtained by averaging measurements at 3 electron beam energies , @xmath33 gev , 200 gev and 280 gev ; however , the details of such averaging are not immediately clear from the original paper .",
    "therefore , i used the minimum and maximum of the computed average variables to obtain the corresponding minimum and maximum of the nn variables , considered as error band around their average value .",
    "data have been selected to fall into 3 bins in @xmath28 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) , and 1 bin in @xmath29 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath28 bins has been made in order to minimize the spread of @xmath28 and @xmath29 inside the bin , and to keep it as much as possible balanced around the middle value .",
    "the chosen @xmath29 bin is the richest in measured data .",
    "furthermore , data with similar @xmath3 and from the same target have been combined , with an error band in both @xmath3 and @xmath30 corresponding to the highest data plus error value and lowest data minus error value , the central value being placed in the middle .",
    "of course , this procedure is a poor man s substitute for direct experimental binning in @xmath3 and @xmath28 .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : coldquenchexp ] clearly show the evolution of final state cold nuclear quenching with rapidity : the quenching increases with decreasing @xmath28 .",
    "this was expected from the kinematic analysis of section  [ sec : lo ] , which shows a decreasing @xmath20 with decreasing rapidity .",
    "the size of hadron quenching is not small , especially for large nuclei and small @xmath28 rapidity .",
    "its evolution with @xmath29 is not shown in the figure because of large overlapping error bars arising in the rebinning procedure . however , the original hermes and emc @xmath31-distributions clearly show an increasing quenching with increasing @xmath31 , especially at large @xmath38 , where most of hadron production in @xmath2 collisions takes place .",
    "note also that quenching increases with the target atomic number .    as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : coldquenchexp ] , the @xmath3 range covered by hermes and emc is quite limited compared to the @xmath3 for which hadron production in @xmath2 and @xmath0 can be measured . as remarked in section  [ sec : nnequiv ] this situation can be improved with a rebinning of emc data , or with new measurements of hadron attenuation in @xmath39 collisions at the compass experiment , which can in principle reach up to @xmath40 gev .",
    "as already remarked , in dis , one has experimental control over all the kinematic variables . in h+a collisions @xmath32 and ,",
    "most importantly for our considerations , @xmath29 are not experimentally accessible . the non - trivial correlation of these variables with the measurable ones is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hermes(rhic ) ] .",
    "moreover , the dependence of hadron quenching on the target atomic number @xmath26 does not seem to follow any simple law @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , it is not possible to directly use the results of fig .  [",
    "fig : coldquenchexp ] to estimate cold nuclear matter effects in h+a collisions , but we need to resort to model computations . there exist 2 classes of models which can reproduce ndis data : ( i ) energy loss models @xcite , which assume that partons hadronize well outside the target nucleus , and loose energy because of gluon radiation induced by rescatterings inside the target ; ( ii ) prehadron absorption models @xcite , which assume that a colorless prehadron is produced inside the target and can be `` absorbed '' via inelastic scatterings on the nucleons .",
    "as already remarked , the order of magnitude of the parton lifetime has not yet been experimentally or theoretically established , and both classes of models remain viable @xcite .",
    "hadron production in @xmath2 collisions has a large contribution from gluon fragmentation , but this process has not been incorporated in absorption models , so far .",
    "therefore i chose to use energy loss models for our estimate .",
    "in particular , i will use the bdms framework as implemented by salgado and wiedemann in @xcite and applied to ndis in @xcite . in this model , the nucleus is considered at rest .",
    "a parton , created with energy @xmath41 in the hard interaction , travels through the nucleus and experiences multiple scatterings and induced gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "hence , it starts the hadronization process with a reduced energy @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the energy of the radiated gluons .",
    "the reduced quark energy at the time of hadronization is translated into a shift of @xmath29 in the vacuum fragmentation function @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the medium modified ff is then computed as @xmath45 where the quenching weight @xmath46 @xcite is the probability distribution of an energy loss @xmath43 , with @xmath47 its continuous part and @xmath48 the probability of no energy loss .",
    "the quenching weight is computed for a static and uniform medium with characteristic gluon energy @xmath49 and size parameter @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the medium length and @xmath52 the transport coefficient of the medium , which characterizes the average transverse momentum squared gained by the parton per unit in - medium path - length @xcite .",
    "however , the nucleus density is static but non - uniform , hence the dependence of @xmath53 on the parton production point @xmath54 , which on the r.h.s .",
    "is implicit in the definition of suitable static - equivalent @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite , see eqs .  - .",
    "they depend on a single parameter , the transport coefficient @xmath57 at the center of a reference nucleus .",
    "the outlined energy - loss model can well describe light hadron suppression in @xmath1 collisions at hermes with @xmath58 gev@xmath59/fm , fitted to @xmath60 production on @xmath61 targets @xcite .",
    "i will use the same value for computations in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the mean free path for a parton in the target nucleus is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the partonic cross - section and @xmath64 the nuclear density .",
    "assuming @xmath63 to be independent of the atomic number , i can define a position - dependent transport coefficient , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the transport coefficient at the center of a reference nucleus of atomic number @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "next , consider a parton produced at @xmath69 which propagates in the nucleus along the @xmath70 direction .",
    "its average path - length @xmath71 can be defined as @xmath72 and the average nuclear density @xmath73 seen by the quark as @xmath74 then , from eq .",
    ", the average transport coefficient experienced by the quark can be defined as @xmath75 for a uniform hard - sphere of nuclear density @xmath76 , the above definitions give @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 as it should be .",
    "finally , the average characteristic gluon energy @xmath80 and size parameter @xmath56 can be defined as follows : @xmath81 these equations have also been used in ref .",
    "@xcite for computations of jet quenching in the hot nuclear medium created in a+a collisions .",
    "note that they depend on only one parameter , @xmath82 .",
    "we can also see that @xmath83 as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper",
    "it was proven that one can approximate the quenching weight for a dynamically expanding medium with the quenching weight for an equivalent static ( and uniform ) medium characterized by the average @xmath84 .",
    "however , the natural parameters of the quenching weight are the gluon characteristic energy and the size parameter .",
    "hence , the scaling law is more properly expressed by saying that the equivalent static and uniform medium is characterized by the average @xmath80 and @xmath56 @xcite . for a parton propagating in a static but non - uniform medium , as in our case",
    ", the spatial non - uniformity is equivalent to a time evolution of the medium .",
    "therefore , as a rough _ ansatz _ , we may generalize the sw scaling law to the case of the static but non - uniform medium encountered in ndis , and use eqs .  - in the quenching weight evaluation .",
    "note , however , that the suitability of a single parameter @xmath52 to describe cold nuclear matter has been recently questioned in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the parton production cross - section can be computed in lo pqcd as discussed in section  [ sec : dis - eqnn ] .",
    "then the hadron production cross - section including cold nuclear jet quenching can be written as @xmath85 where up to terms of order @xmath86 , the target rest frame parton and hadron energy are @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the target rest frame rapidities of the parton and the hadron .",
    "isospin corrections related to the target nucleus have been included in the partonic cross section @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we can quantify cold matter final state energy loss effects by the ratio of the above discussed cross section for collisions on 2 targets of atomic number @xmath26 and @xmath90 : @xmath91^{-1 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the amount of hadron quenching by @xmath92 .",
    "the computed @xmath93 for charged pion production with no centrality selection is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldquenchtheory ] .",
    "when examining these plots , one should keep in mind that they are intended only o show the extent of the suppression effects on hadron production due to cold nuclear matter energy loss of the final state parton .",
    "they do not include the related transverse momentum broadening nor initial state effects , which will be commented on in the next section .",
    "the plots show a substantial final state hadron quenching already for midrapidity hadrons at sps and fnal energy , and for @xmath94 at rhic .",
    "the quenching at rhic is reduced when increasing the rapidity , but is still non - negligible at @xmath95 , where it is of order 5% at @xmath10 gev .",
    "this may explain the small @xmath9 quenching apparent in recent midrapidity phenix data @xcite .",
    "final state cold quenching at rhic should then quickly disappear at forward rapidity . at the lhc",
    ", we may expect negligible final state effects at @xmath96 because of the rapidity shift @xmath97 in table  [ tab : deltay1 ] .",
    "i also found a small hadron flavor dependence at small @xmath98 , not shown in the plots , showing less suppression for kaon and proton production than for pion production .",
    "it would be interesting to compare these estimates , obtained in the quenching weight formalism of salgado and wiedemann @xcite , with the results of other energy loss implementations such as the twist-4 formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite and the reaction operator approach of ref .",
    ". a nice comparison of the available formalisms has been recently discussed in ref .",
    "before discussing the phenomenological relevance of the estimate of cold nuclear matter effects obtained in the last section , we need to discuss the importance of initial state effects , so far neglected .",
    "the initial state parton suffers multiple scatterings and medium - induced gluon radiation . in a simple phenomenological model @xcite",
    ", the resulting energy loss may be accounted for by a shift of the incoming parton fractional momentum , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 the fractional is energy loss .",
    "the effect of such energy loss is felt in a kinematic region where the flux of incoming partons varies rapidly with @xmath101 , typically at large rapidity .",
    "numerical estimates from @xcite indicate that is state energy loss in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath102 become relevant only at forward rapidity @xmath103 . according to the rapidity shifts listed in table  [ tab : deltay1 ] , we may expect a similar conclusion to hold for @xmath104 at rhic ( lhc ) .",
    "if the final state parton is long lived , as assumed in the theoretical estimates of the previous section , the medium affects hadron production mainly through elastic and radiative energy losses . in this case , the fs energy loss enters the computations as a shift in @xmath29 of the fragmentation function , see eq .  .",
    "hence , differently from is energy loss , it is large in regions where the fragmentation functions changes rapidly in @xmath29 , namely at large @xmath29 . at fixed @xmath98 the average @xmath105 increases with decreasing rapidity and decreasing @xmath106 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eiefphtz ] right ) .",
    "coupling this with a decrease in final state parton energy @xmath107 with decreasing rapidity , it is easy to explain the behavior and large size of final state suppression shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldquenchtheory ] .",
    "a consistent framework for considering the interplay of is and fs energy loss in the reaction operator formalism is discussed in ref .",

    "they both start at around 10% when @xmath111 gev , but fs energy loss tends rapidly to 0 as @xmath110 increases , contrary to is energy loss which stabilizes around 5% at @xmath112 tev .",
    "however , particle production at fixed rapidity in @xmath2 and @xmath0 collisions shows a strong correlation between the is parton energy @xmath113 and the fs parton energy @xmath107 , see fig .",

    "@xcite indicate that they are large .",
    "their effect on the midrapidity region has to be more carefully and quantitatively considered : it depends on the center of mass energy of the collision , and can be expected to decrease with increasing @xmath106 .",
    "in this paper , i have examined the role of final state interactions in cold nuclear matter in modifying hadron production on nuclear targets with leptonic or hadronic beams .",
    "initial state parton energy loss has been considered in @xcite . since in @xmath1 collisions",
    "only fs interactions are present , i built a kinematic dictionary that relates the variables used for the discussion of ndis and heavy - ion @xmath13 collisions , and demonstrated the ( limited ) extent to which available experimental data on hadron suppression in ndis can give direct information on final state cold nuclear matter effects in @xmath13 collisions . in this respect ,",

    "the latter option is particularly interesting : compass has a similar kinematic coverage to emc , but higher luminosity and very good particle identification capabilities .",
    "therefore a @xmath39 program at compass , building on the knowledge accumulated at the hermes @xcite and clas experiments @xcite , would greatly improve our knowledge of the space - time evolution of hadronization , and gather vital data for the interpretation of @xmath2 and @xmath0 collisions and the quest for the quark gluon plasma .      1 .",
    "is and fs energy loss , and possibly fs prehadron absorption , suppress hadron spectra by non negligible amounts at forward @xcite and backward rapidity , respectively .",
