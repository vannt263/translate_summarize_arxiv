    "because brown dwarfs are relatively bright soon after birth and fade precipitously thereafter , star - forming clusters are the most promising sites in which to search for the least massive brown dwarfs . at a distance of 160 - 170",
    "pc @xcite , the chamaeleon  i cloud complex is one of the nearest major star formation regions and therefore is a particularly attractive hunting ground .",
    "a variety of methods have been used to identify candidate low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in chamaeleon  i , including objective prism spectroscopy at h@xmath4 @xcite , photometric variability @xcite , x - ray emission @xcite , and optical and infrared ( ir ) photometry @xcite .",
    "all spectroscopic observations of candidates from these surveys have been compiled and evaluated by @xcite , with the exception of the recent spectroscopy provided by @xcite . to date , the coolest confirmed members of chamaeleon  i have spectral types of @xmath5m8 , corresponding to masses of @xmath6  @xmath3 .    from the previous surveys of chamaeleon",
    ", there remain several promising candidate brown dwarfs that lack spectroscopy and that should have masses as low as 0.01  @xmath3 if they are indeed late - type members of the star - forming region . during the recent commissioning of the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) , we obtained near - ir spectroscopy of the two faintest objects from the compilation of candidates in @xcite , sources 7 and 44 from @xcite ( hereafter ots  7 and 44 ) . in this letter",
    ", we describe these observations (   [ sec : obs ] ) , assess the membership of the candidates in chamaeleon  i and measure the spectral type for the one confirmed member (   [ sec : mem ] ) , estimate the extinction , effective temperature , and bolometric luminosity of that source (   [ sec : ext ] ) , and infer its mass from theoretical evolutionary models (   [ sec : mass ] ) .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy was performed on the brown dwarf candidates ots  44 and 7 during queue observations with gnirs at gemini south observatory on the nights of 2004 march 9 and 10 , respectively . to facilitate the spectral classification of these objects , we also observed an optically - classified late - type member of chamaeleon  i , source 17173 from @xcite ( hereafter chsm  17173 ) .",
    "the spectrograph was operated in the cross - dispersed mode with the 31.7  l  mm@xmath7 grating and a @xmath8 slit , producing full coverage from 1 to 2.5  with a spectral resolution that varied between @xmath9 and 2200 depending on wavelength .",
    "each object was dithered between two positions along the slit separated by @xmath10 .",
    "the numbers of exposures and the integration times were @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  sec for chsm  17173 , ots  44 , and ots  7 , respectively .",
    "a nearby a0  v star ( hd  98671 ) was also observed for the correction of telluric absorption .",
    "after dark subtraction and flat - fielding , adjacent images along the slit were subtracted from each other to remove sky emission .",
    "the sky - subtracted images were aligned and combined .",
    "a spectrum was extracted from each of the five orders in the cross - dispersed format .",
    "the detectable hydrogen absorption lines in the spectrum of the telluric standard were removed manually through interpolation .",
    "the intrinsic spectral slope of the standard was removed with an artificial blackbody spectrum of @xmath14  k. at a given order , this modified spectrum was then divided into the extracted spectra of the three targets .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with oh airglow lines . for each object ,",
    "the spectra from the five orders were scaled multiplicatively to align the overlapping regions between adjacent orders to the same flux level .    during the spectral classification of the gnirs targets in ",
    "[ sec : mem ] , we use spectra of standards obtained with the near - ir spectrometer spex @xcite at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) . the field dwarf lhs  2065 ( m9v ) and the young taurus member kpno  4 ( m9.5 , @xcite ) were observed with spex on the nights of 2003 december 21 and 23 , respectively .",
    "the instrument was operated in the prism mode with a @xmath15 slit , producing a wavelength coverage of 0.8 - 2.5  and a resolution of @xmath16 .",
    "the spectra were reduced with the spextool package @xcite , which included the same basic steps described for the gnirs data reduction .",
    "we corrected for telluric absorption with the method described by @xcite .",
    "the gnirs spectra of the brown dwarf candidates ots  7 and 44 and the known late - type chamaeleon member chsm  17173 are shown in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "the spectrum of ots  44 closely resembles that of chsm  17173 , mostly notably in terms of the strong steam absorption bands . in this section",
    ", we assess the membership of this object in chamaeleon  i and measure its spectral type .",
    "meanwhile , the steam absorption expected from a cool photosphere is absent from the spectrum of ots  7 .",
    "this object is probably an early - type field star or a background galaxy and is discussed no further .",
    "ots  44 could be a field dwarf , a field giant , or a young , pre - main - sequence member of chamaeleon  i. these distinct luminosity classes can be differentiated with spectral features that are sensitive to surface gravity , a variety of which have been identified for cool objects at both optical @xcite and near - ir @xcite wavelengths . in this work , we do not consider the gravity - sensitive atomic transitions , such as k  i at @xmath17 and na  i at @xmath1 , because of insufficient signal - to - noise and spectral resolution in the gnirs spectrum of ots  44 and the spex data , respectively .",
    "instead , we use the steam absorption bands to determine if ots  44 is a young member of chamaeleon  i. the shape of the continuum induced by steam absorption varies noticeably with surface gravity .",
    "the broad plateaus in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra of late - m and l dwarfs @xcite are absent in young objects , resulting in sharply peaked , triangular continua @xcite .",
    "this gravity diagnostic is easily detectable at the signal - to - noise and resolution of our data , as illustrated with the spectra of the young late - type object kpno  4 and the field dwarf lhs  2065 in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] .",
    "ots  44 is compared to these two objects in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] , where we find that it clearly exhibits the triangular continua that are indicative of youth rather than the broad plateaus expected for a field dwarf .",
    "meanwhile , the strength of the co bandheads in ots  44 is comparable to that of the comparison dwarf and young object and much less than that of an m giant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the behavior of these spectral features , we conclude that ots  44 is not a field dwarf or giant and is instead a member of the chamaeleon  i star - forming region .",
    "in addition to surface gravity , the ir steam bands are also sensitive to temperature and thus can be used to measure spectral types @xcite . at a given optical spectral type , these bands are stronger in young objects than in field dwarfs @xcite , as shown with kpno  4 and lhs  2065 in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] . as a result ,",
    "if a young source is classified by comparing the strength of its steam absorption to that of field dwarfs , the derived spectral type will be systematically too late .",
    "to arrive at accurate spectral types , optically - classified young objects rather than dwarfs should be used as the standards @xcite , which is the approach we adopt for classifying ots  44 . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec2 ] , we find that the depths of the steam bands in ots  44 closely match those in kpno  4 , which has an optical type of m9.5 . because few ir spectra of young optically - classified late - type objects are available , we can not compare ots  44 to a finely sampled sequence of standards and determine the precise range of types that would match the steam depths for ots  44 .",
    "this source is clearly later than chsm  17173 ( m8 , @xcite ) according to the relative strengths of their steam bands , as shown in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "meanwhile , we have no constraints on the latest possible type for this object . for the purposes of this work , we assign an uncertainty of @xmath18  subclass to the m9.5 classification of ots  44 . the latest spectral types for previously confirmed members of chamaeleon  i are m8 for chsm  17173 @xcite , m8.25 for 2mass  j11011926 - 7732383b @xcite , and m8.5 for source 554 from @xcite .",
    "at a type of m9.5 , ots  44 is now the latest confirmed member of chamaeleon  i.      we can estimate the extinction of ots  44 from its near - ir spectrum and colors .",
    "the comparison of the 1 - 2.5  spectra of ots  44 and chsm  17173 in figure  [ fig : spec1 ] and the relative @xmath19 and @xmath20 colors of ots  44 and kpno - tau  4 imply that ots  44 is slightly redder ( @xmath21 ) than both of these objects .",
    "both chsm  17173 and kpno  4 lack noticeable reddening in their optical spectra .",
    "therefore , for ots  44 we estimate an extinction @xmath22 .",
    "for the m9.5 spectral type of ots  44 , we adopt the temperature of 2300  k used by @xcite for kpno  4 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is estimated by combining the @xmath0-band measurement from @xcite , a distance of 168  pc @xcite , and a bolometric correction for m9.5 from @xcite .",
    "the combined uncertainties in @xmath23 , @xmath0 , bc@xmath24 , and the distance modulus ( @xmath25 , 0.05 , 0.2 , 0.13 ) correspond to an error of @xmath26 in log  @xmath27 .",
    "the extinction , effective temperature , and bolometric luminosity for ots  44 are listed in table  [ tab : data ] . for comparison",
    ", we also include the same parameters for kpno  4 as estimated by @xcite .",
    "the temperature and luminosity for ots  44 from the previous section can be used to estimate its mass via theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "we select the models of @xcite and @xcite because they provide the best agreement with observational constraints @xcite .",
    "ots  44 and previously known late - type members of chamaeleon  i @xcite are plotted on the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] with these evolutionary models , which imply a mass of @xmath2  @xmath3 for ots  44 .",
    "the uncertainty in the spectral type of ots  44 corresponds to roughly a factor of two in mass .",
    "the conversion of spectral type to temperature and the models themselves contribute additional errors to this mass estimate that can not be quantified .",
    "nevertheless , because ots  44 has the lowest luminosity and temperature of any confirmed member of chamaeleon  i , it very likely has the lowest mass .",
    "this brown dwarf is one of the nearest and least massive free - floating objects discovered to date .",
    "we thank the staff of gemini observatory , particularly bernadette rodgers , for performing the gnirs observations .",
    "we also thank john rayner for assistance with the irtf spex observations .",
