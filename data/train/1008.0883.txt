    "starting with the work of @xcite , the conifold @xcite has played a prominent role in the study of gauge / gravity dualities preserving @xmath8 supersymmetry on the field theory side .",
    "this manifold is a simple non - compact calabi ",
    "yau 3-fold , which can be seen as a cone over the homogeneous space @xmath9 endowed with its sasaki  einstein metric",
    ". the singularity at the tip of the cone can be smoothed , while preserving the calabi ",
    "yau structure , either by a small resolution or via a deformation , leading to the resolved or the deformed conifold respectively .",
    "these geometries can be used to construct supersymmetric solutions of type iib supergravity whose dual field theories display some extremely interesting physical properties , like the breaking of conformality @xcite , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "recently , the fruitful interplay between the conifold and type iib supergravity has been further investigated in @xcite , where a solution exhibiting a geometric transition between the resolved and the deformed conifold purely within the supergravity framework was found .",
    "the dual 4-dimensional field theories , and in particular their renormalization group flow , can be described holographically in a 5-dimensional setup , with the fifth ( radial ) coordinate playing the role of the renormalization group scale @xcite .",
    "the 10-dimensional solution can be reproduced in a 5-dimensional framework after having performed an appropriate dimensional reduction of type iib supergravity on the compact transverse space ( @xmath0 here ) .",
    "the conifold backgrounds mentioned above have just a radial profile ; remarkably , in these cases the system of first - order differential equations for the supersymmetric radial flow generating the supergravity solution can be deduced from a single function of the fields , the superpotential @xcite . in particular , papadopoulos and tseytlin @xcite obtained a truncation containing all the solutions in @xcite , and providing the corresponding superpotentials .",
    "the truncation ansatz of @xcite provides the metric plus a set of scalars in 5 dimensions . under the further assumption of 4-dimensional poincar invariance",
    ", type iib supergravity actually reduces to a 1-dimensional action describing the evolution of the fields with respect to the radial coordinate .    in @xcite , the papadopoulos ",
    "tseytlin ansatz was generalized to allow an arbitrary field dependence on all the spacetime coordinates transverse to the compact @xmath0 manifold , and the corresponding 5-dimensional action was derived .",
    "this extension allowed to extract informations about mass spectra and correlation functions of the dual field theory by studying supergravity field fluctuations in the 5-dimensional effective model .",
    "as the truncation was shown to be consistent ( modulo a hamiltonian constraint to be imposed separately ) , any solution found in the lower - dimensional setup is guaranteed to lift to the full type iib theory .",
    "the papadopoulos ",
    "tseytlin ansatz has also been used to find a solution of type iib supergravity interpolating between the klebanov ",
    "strassler @xcite and the maldacena ",
    "nuez @xcite solutions @xcite .",
    "although these backgrounds , as well as those in @xcite are supersymmetric , the effective 5-dimensional model of @xcite does not exhibit manifest supersymmetry ( even in the weaker sense that it does not coincide with the bosonic sector of a supersymmetric theory ) , and it was then classified as a fake supergravity model @xcite . as a consequence , studying the supersymmetry properties of the solutions directly in 5 dimensions is not straightforward .    in this paper",
    "we overcome this limitation by embedding the models of @xcite in a genuine supergravity action .",
    "the latter is obtained via a consistent truncation of type iib supergravity on the @xmath0 coset preserving @xmath2 supersymmetry in 5 dimensions .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we derived a consistent truncation of type iib supergravity on general squashed sasaki ",
    "einstein manifolds , leading to a gauged @xmath2 supergravity in 5 dimensions with two vector multiplets ( see also @xcite for related work , and @xcite for previous consistent truncations on ( squashed ) sasaki  einstein manifolds ) .",
    "the truncation was based on expanding the 10-dimensional fields in a set of differential forms characterizing a sasaki  einstein structure .",
    "in the present paper we show that , for the specific case in which the compact manifold admitting a sasaki  einstein structure is the @xmath0 coset space , it is possible to enhance the consistent truncation of @xcite by incorporating an additional vector multiplet of 5-dimensional @xmath2 supergravity .",
    "this is obtained by adopting a truncation ansatz which retains all and only those modes of type iib supergravity that are invariant under the su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) acting transitively on the @xmath0 coset from the left .",
    "this symmetry protecting the retained modes guarantees the truncation to be consistent , while the preserved amount of supersymmetry is rather related to the structure group on @xmath0 being contained in su(2 ) .",
    "flux compactifications on su(3 ) structure manifolds , an explicit proof of consistency for left - invariant reductions on coset spaces was given in @xcite . ]    in addition to the expansion forms considered in @xcite , namely the minimal basis existing on any 5-dimensional manifold admitting a sasaki  einstein structure , the left - invariant forms on @xmath0 include a 2-form and a 3-form non - trivial in cohomology , reflecting the fact that topologically @xmath10 .",
    "it follows in particular that , beside the rr 5-form flux considered in @xcite , we can now include in the truncation both nsns and rr 3-form fluxes .",
    "these lead to additional gaugings of the 5-dimensional supergravity model , that we analyse in detail applying the embedding tensor formalism .    together with the inclusion of the 3-form fluxes , the @xmath2 vector multiplet that we are adding to the truncation of @xcite is crucial for the gauge / gravity applications .",
    "indeed , among the scalars contained in this multiplet there are both the resolution and the deformation modes of the conifold , as well as the modes of the type iib 2-form potentials responsible for the running of the coupling constants in the dual field theories .",
    "moreover , the new vector field is dual to the baryonic current operator . to make the dual picture of our truncation precise , we identify the full set of operators in the conifold gauge theory @xcite which are dual to the supergravity modes we retain",
    "this is done via a study of the mass spectrum about the supersymmetric ads@xmath3 background and a comparison with the results of  @xcite .    as a first application of our consistent truncation",
    ", we search for new ads@xmath3 solutions of type iib supergravity by extremizing the 5-dimensional scalar potential .",
    "we find an interesting family of non - supersymmetric backgrounds interpolating between a solution found long ago by romans @xcite and a new solution of the freund  rubin type involving an einstein metric on @xmath0 not related to the usual sasaki ",
    "einstein one .",
    "however , a stability test against the left - invariant modes reveals that at least a subsector of our family of solutions is unstable .    beside the non - supersymmetric model arising from the papadopoulos - tseytlin ansatz @xcite , and in addition to the cases already discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the present @xmath2 reduction admits some further consistent truncations , which preserve just @xmath4 supersymmetry and have a rather simple field content . as we will see , one of these truncations has the proper field content to capture the klebanov ",
    "strassler solution @xcite , and even to describe smeared d7-branes in this background @xcite . moreover",
    ", a second @xmath4 truncation provides a minimal supersymmetric completion to the one recently elaborated in @xcite to study charged black 3-brane solutions possibly relevant for the holographic description of condensed matter phenomena .",
    "we hope that our supersymmetric truncations could also be applied to properly embed into string theory models describing condensed matter systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ t11cosetgeom ]",
    "we introduce the @xmath0 geometry , focusing on its coset structure and computing the left - invariant tensors . in section [ dimred ]",
    "we elaborate our su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) invariant truncation ansatz for type iib supergravity , and present the 5-dimensional action .",
    "the compatibility of this model with the structure of gauged @xmath2 supergravity is detailed in section [ gaugedsugra ] .",
    "we continue in section [ newfamilyads ] by presenting our new interpolating family of ads@xmath3 solutions , while in section [ dualoperators ] we identify the dual operators .",
    "the consistent subtruncations preserving @xmath4 supersymmetry are discussed in section [ n=2subtrunc ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] by providing some possible lines of future research .",
    "three appendices complete the paper : appendix [ reduct10dricci ] contains the reduction of the 10-dimensional ricci tensor , appendix [ recoveringpt ] provides the dictionary between our truncation and the papadopoulos ",
    "tseytlin one , and appendix [ gaugetransf ] discusses the 5-dimensional gauge transformations arising from a reduction of the 10-dimensional symmetries .",

    "once the dictionary is used , it reproduces the constraint in pt .",
    "the rest of the equations of motion for the fields not present in the pt ansatz are exactly satisfied and thus do not give supplementary constraints .",
    "in this appendix we study how the gauge symmetry of the 5-dimensional action arises from the 10-dimensional reparameterization invariance as well as from the gauge symmetry of the type iib supergravity form fields .",
    "as already discussed in section [ red10dcurvature ] , a crucial symmetry of the action comes from the invariance under reparametrizations of the u(1 ) fibre coordinate which are local in the spacetime , @xmath335 .",
    "then the associated 1-form @xmath336 is shifted as @xmath337 .",
    "recalling the ansatz for the 10-dimensional metric ( [ 10dmetric ] ) , this is interpreted from the viewpoint as a gauge transformation of the 1-form @xmath77 , @xmath338 we already saw that among the metric parameters we have a charged scalar , whose phase @xmath79 shifts as @xmath339 furthermore , one can see from the explicit expression of the coset 1-forms ( [ vielbeins ] ) that while @xmath53 and @xmath52 , defined in ( [ leftinvforms ] ) , are invariant , @xmath54 has an explicit dependence on the coordinate @xmath75 , and thus transforms .",
    "this implies that the spacetime fields associated to @xmath54 in the expansion of the type iib forms are charged .",
    "applying this to the 3-form field strengths @xmath101 and @xmath116 expanded as in section [ formfields ] , one deduces the following transformations @xmath340 \\delta b^\\omega & = & 3i\\omega\\,b^\\omega\\ , , & \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad & \\delta c^\\omega & = & 3i\\omega\\,c^\\omega\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] we point out that , while @xmath108 and @xmath341 have the charges and couplings of abelian higgs scalars , the real fields @xmath106 and @xmath209 have shift transformations and are therefore stckelberg coupled , with the corresponding covariant derivatives @xmath342(given in section [ formfields ] ) being invariant .",
    "we now pass to consider the gauge symmetries of the type iib forms . together with the usual transformations for the 2-forms",
    "@xmath343 we see that the presence of the 3-form fluxes alters the transformation of the rr 4-form .",

    "these redefined fields are the ones directly identified with the @xmath255 vectors in the body of the paper . as a further check of the validity of the gauged @xmath255 supergravity picture",
    "we have matched these variations with the ones provided in @xcite and given essentially in terms of the embedding tensor ( see also @xcite for a discussion from this perspective ) .",
    "the gauge group @xmath353 of our 5-dimensional model can be deduced by studying the scalar transformations . from ( [ eq : scaltransfs1 ] ) , ( [ eq : scaltransfs2 ] ) we see that the only non - vanishing commutator is @xmath354\\,a\\ , = 4\\lambda\\gamma\\,=\\ , 2\\,\\delta_{(\\sigma^j=\\lambda\\gamma)}\\,a\\,,\\ ] ] hence we conclude that @xmath355 , with the heisenberg factor being generated by the transformations with parameters @xmath356 , and the u(1 ) being generated by the .",
    "this agrees with what found in section [ embtensor ] via the embedding tensor .",
    "the realization of the gauge group on the 1-forms is more subtle , due to the entanglement with the 2-forms : while @xmath357 are proper gauge fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath353 , the variations of @xmath358 and @xmath207 also contain the 2-form transformation parameters , and therefore do not correspond to standard lie algebra transformations .    finally , we remark that by switching off the nsns and rr fluxes , as well as the geometric fluxes associated with the non - closure of the basis forms , we obtain the correct limit to ungauged @xmath2 supergravity",
    "indeed , setting @xmath359 , and repeating the derivation above assuming @xmath360 , the gauge variations of the 5-dimensional forms reduce to abelian transformations , and the scalars become all neutral",
