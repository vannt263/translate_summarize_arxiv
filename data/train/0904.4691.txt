    "the atiyah - hitchin space is a part of the set of two monopole solutions of bogomolnyi equation .",
    "the moduli space of solutions is of the form@xmath0where the factor @xmath1 describes the center of mass of two monopoles and a phase factor that is related to the total electric charge of the system .",
    "the interesting part of the moduli space is the four - dimensional manifold @xmath2 , which has self - dual curvature .",
    "the self - duality comes from the hyper - khler property of the moduli space .",
    "since @xmath1 is flat and decouples from @xmath2 , the four - dimensional manifold @xmath2 should be hyper - khler , which is equivalent to a metric with self - dual curvature in four dimensions . the manifold @xmath2 describes the separation of the two monopoles and their relative phase angle ( or electric charges ) .",
    "a further aspect concerning @xmath2 is that it should be @xmath3  invariant , since two monopoles do exist in ordinary flat space ; hence the metric on @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of three functions of the monopole separation .",
    "self - duality implies that these three functions obey a set of first - order ordinary differential equations .",
    "this space has been used recently for construction of five - dimensional three - charge supergravity solutions that only have a rotational @xmath4 isometry @xcite as well as construction of m - brane solutions @xcite .",
    "moreover , atiyah - hitchin space and its various generalizations were identified with the full quantum moduli space of @xmath5 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the context of string theory and brane world , investigations on black hole ( ring ) solutions in higher dimensions have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "it is believed that in the strong coupling limit , many horizonless three - charge brane configurations undergo a geometric transition and become smooth horizonless geometries with black hole or black ring charges @xcite .",
    "these charges come completely from fluxes wrapping on non - trivial cycles .",
    "the three - charge black hole ( ring ) systems are dual to the states of corresponding conformal field theories : in favor of the idea that non - fundamental - black hole ( ring ) systems effectively arise as a result of many horizonless configurations @xcite . in eleven - dimensional supergravity , there are solutions based on transverse four - dimensional hyper - khler metrics ( which are equivalent to metrics with self - dual curvatures ) . the hyper - khlericity of transverse metric guarantees ( at least partially ) to have supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "there are also many solutions to five - dimensional minimal supergravity . in five - dimensions , unlike the four dimensions that the only horizon topology is 2-sphere , we can have different more interesting horizon topologies such as black holes with horizon topology of 3-sphere @xcite , black rings with horizon topology of 2-sphere @xmath6 circle @xcite , black saturn : a spherical black hole  surrounded by a black ring @xcite , black lens which the horizon geometry is a lens space @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "all allowed horizon topologies have been classified in @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown how a uniqueness theorem might be proved for black holes in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "it was shown stationary , asymptotically flat vacuum black holes with two commuting axial symmetries are uniquely determined by their mass , angular momentum and rod structure .",
    "specifically , the rod structure @xcite determines the topology of horizon in five dimensions . in the references @xcite , the authors constructed ( multi ) black hole solutions in the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory ( with and without cosmological constant )",
    "based on four - dimensional taub - nut and eguchi - hanson spaces .",
    "both spaces have self - dual curvatures and can be put into a gibbons - hawking form .",
    "although hyper - khler atiyah - hitchin space also has self - dual curvature , it can not be put into a gibbons - hawking form .    motivated by these facts , in this article we try to construct solutions to five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory based on atiyah - hitchin space .",
    "we note that hyper - khler atiyah - hitchin geometries ( unlike gibbons - hawking geometries ) do not have any tri - holomorphic @xmath4 isometry , hence our solutions could be used to study the physical processes that do not respect any tri - holomorphic @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "we consider the atiyah - hitchin space as a base space and by performing a coordinate transformation , we are able to considerably simplify the structure of the five - dimensional metric .",
    "this is the first step toward construction of more sophisticated solutions ( such as black holes or rings ) in five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory based on atiyah - hitchin space .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec:5dreview ] ,",
    "we review briefly the einstein - maxwell theory , the atiyah - hitchin space and its features . in section [ sec : sol ] , we present our solutions based on two forms for the atiyah - hitchin space and discuss the asymptotics of solutions .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : con ] with a summary of our solutions and possible future research directions .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory is described by the action @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are five - dimensional ricci scalar and maxwell field .",
    "the einstein and maxwell equations are @xmath11 respectively .",
    "we take the following form for the five - dimensional metric @xmath12and the only non - vanishing component of gauge field as @xmath13where @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the atiyah - hitchin metric @xmath16 is given by the following manifestly @xmath3 invariant form @xcite @xmath17with @xmath18where @xmath19 are maurer - cartan one - forms with the property @xmath20we note that the metric on the @xmath21 ( with a radial coordinate @xmath9 and euler angles ( @xmath22 ) on an @xmath23 ) could be written in terms of maurer - cartan one - forms by @xmath24we also note that @xmath25 is the standard metric of the round unit radius @xmath26 and @xmath27 gives the same for @xmath28 the metric ( ahmetric ) satisfies einstein s equations provided@xmath29choosing * *  * * @xmath30 * *  * * the explicit expressions for the metric functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by@xmath33where @xmath34and @xmath35 in the above equations , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the elliptic integrals @xmath38and the coordinate @xmath39 ranges over the interval @xmath40 , which corresponds to @xmath41 the positive number @xmath42  is a constant number with unit of length that is related to nut charge of metric at infinity obtained from atiyah - hitchin metric ( [ ahmetric ] ) .",
    "in fact as @xmath43 the metric ( [ ahmetric ] ) reduces to @xmath44which is the well known euclidean taub - nut metric with a negative nut charge @xmath45 the metric ( [ reducedah ] ) is obtained from a consideration of the limiting behaviors of the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 at large monopole separation that are given by@xmath46 in the other extreme limit where @xmath47 , from equations ( [ abc1]-[abc3 ] ) , we find the following behaviors for the metric functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 equation ( [ anp ] ) shows clearly a bolt singularity as @xmath51 . actually , by using the @xmath3 invariance of the metric , we can write the metric element ( [ ahmetric ] ) near the bolt location as@xmath52where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are a new set of euler angles related to @xmath55  @xmath56  by@xmath57 in which @xmath58  represents a rotation by @xmath59  about the @xmath60- th axis .",
    "we note that the last term in ( [ nearbolt ] ) is the induced metric on the two - dimensional bolt .",
    "to find the five - dimensional metric function @xmath61 , we consider equations of motion ( [ eeq]-[geq ] ) .",
    "the metric ( [ ds5 ] ) ( along with the gauge field ( [ gauge5 ] ) ) is a solution to einstein - maxwell equations provided @xmath62 is a solution to the differential equation ,",
    "@xmath63 so , we find @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two constants of integration .",
    "although the @xmath39-dependences of metric functions @xmath67 , are given explicitly in equations ( [ abc1]-[abc3 ] ) , but it s unlikely to find an analytic expression for @xmath61 given by ( [ hsol ] ) . as @xmath68 ,",
    "the metric function ( [ hsol ] ) goes to @xmath69 on the other hand , near bolt , the metric function @xmath61 has a logarithmic divergence as @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "this type of divergence in the metric function has been observed previously in the metric function of m2-brane in a transverse atiyah - hitchin space @xcite .",
    "as we noticed , we could not find a closed analytic expression for the metric function given in ( [ hsol ] ) . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we choose @xmath72 in ( [ ahmetric ] ) to be @xmath73 and so the atiyah - hitchin metric reads @xmath74 where functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 satisfy equations ( [ conditions1]-[conditions3 ] ) with @xmath77 and @xmath78 means @xmath79 . by introducing the new functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 the set of equations ( [ conditions1]-[conditions3 ] ) with @xmath77 reduces onto a darboux - halpern system @xmath83 we can find the solutions to the above equations as @xmath84 where @xmath85 the new coordinate @xmath86 is related to the coordinate @xmath87 by @xmath88 figure ( [ xivertheta ] ) shows result of numerical integration the relation between two coordinates @xmath87 and @xmath86 .",

    "hence , in the range of @xmath99 , @xmath96 is positive and so the change of variables , given in ( [ theta ] ) , is completely well defined .     versus @xmath86 . ]    as one can see from figure ( [ psis ] ) , functions @xmath100 are always negative and @xmath101 is always positive .",

    "the geometry of solution on a @xmath110constant hyper - surface is quite simple . at @xmath111 which corresponds to @xmath98 ,",
    "the metric functions given in equations ( [ psis1 ] , [ psis2 ] , [ psis3 ] ) reduce to @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "hence , we get @xmath114 which is conformaly the euclidean taub - nut metric @xcite or fibration of a unit circle ( parametrized with @xmath115 ) over @xmath116 . here",
    "the coordinate @xmath117 is related to @xmath118 by @xmath119 and to @xmath87 by @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "the ricci scalar of the spacetime ( [ ah5ex ] ) approaches @xmath121 as @xmath122 and the kretschman invariant approaches @xmath123 where @xmath124 are functions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 . on the other extreme level where @xmath125 , which corresponds to @xmath126 , the metric functions behave as @xmath127 in this limit , the elliptic integral in equation ( [ varw ] ) approaches",
    "@xmath128 hence from equations ( [ varw ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) , we get @xmath129 and we find the metric as @xmath130 by changing to the coordinate @xmath131 , the metric ( [ bolt ] ) changes to @xmath132 ( up to a conformal factor ) which clearly shows a bolt at @xmath93 of fixed radius @xmath133 .",
    "the ricci scalar and kretschman invariant of the metric ( [ ah5ex ] ) near the bolt behave as @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "one way to avoid bolt region is to consider positive values for both @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in this case",
    ", the range of @xmath87 is limited to @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "although there is still a curvature singularity at @xmath138 of the order of @xmath139 where @xmath140 , but it is quite less divergent than singularity on the bolt .",
    "this latter singularity is a simple result of our symmetric metric function @xmath61 in the ansatz ( [ ds5 ] ) that could be removed by considering some non - symmetric metric functions .",
    "we leave this case along with some other open issues for a future article .",
    "the main result of this article is the metric ( [ ah5ex ] ) along with the gauge field ( [ gaugefin ] ) that are exact solutions to the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell equations . to our knowledge ,",
    "these solutions are the first known solutions to five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory based on non - triholomorphic base space , hence they could be used to study the physical processes that do not have any triholomorphic symmetry .",
    "simplicity of these solutions ( simple analytic metric functions ) is a result of taking the base atiyah - hitchin metric in the form of ( [ ahmetric2 ] ) ; otherwise the metric function ( [ hsol ] ) can not be obtained in a simple analytic form .",
    "the metric function and the gauge field are regular everywhere in spacetime .",
    "the metric is regular everywhere except on the location of original bolt in four - dimensional atiyah - hitchin space .",
    "the similar results have been observed previously in higher - dimensional ( super)gravity solutions based on transverse self - dual hyper - khler manifolds @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a few comments about possible directions for future work . in our solutions",
    ", we have considered the simplest dependence of the five - dimensional metric function and gauge field on the coordinates ( i.e. dependence only to the radial coordinate ) .",
    "we can seek for other solutions for which the functions appearing in the metric , depend on more coordinates .",
    "it s quite possible that in these solutions , the singularity in the location of bolt can be converted to a regular hypersurface(s ) in five - dimensional space - time and we obtain atiyah - hitchin black hole solutions .",
    "the other possibility is to include the cosmological constant into the theory that may lift the singularity behind some regular hypersurface(s ) .",
    "moreover the solutions could be used to study ( a)ds / cft correspondence where atiyah - hitchin space is a part of bulk spacetime .",
    "the other open issue is study of the thermodynamics of solutions constructed in this paper ."
