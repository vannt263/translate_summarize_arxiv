    "the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) are layered materials of covalently bonded atoms held together by weak van der waals forces  @xcite .",
    "a representative compound of the tmdc family , molybdenum disulphide ( mos@xmath0 ) , for example , consists of layers of molybdenum atoms surrounded by sulphur in a trigonal prismatic arrangement  @xcite .",
    "the bulk mos@xmath0 is an indirect band gap semiconductor which can , however , through mechanical exfoliation yield a layered two - dimensional configuration of mo and s atoms .",
    "this two - dimensional arrangement or a single layer of mos@xmath0 is a direct band gap semiconductor @xmath1 unlike its bulk counterpart .",
    "@xcite further , in contrast to the semi - metallic , two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene  @xcite , the direct band gap of mos@xmath2 makes it optically active in the visible electromagnetic spectrum  @xcite positioning it as a potential complement to graphene - based photonic applications .",
    "in addition , the mono - layer variants of tmdcs exhibit a great degree of sensitivity to external influences , for example , strain which significantly alters their band gap and the overall electron spectrum allowing for variable light absorption suitable for a wide class of applications . while idealized optical set - ups with tmds have been investigated before  @xcite , the ability to control the electromagnetic response of the media through which light wave travels and the attenuation it suffers before being absorbed for purposes of detection and modulation can yield useful results and aid the design of better optical devices .    in this work , we account for these phenomena and obtain absorption characteristics of a mono - layer tmdc sheet placed between two dielectrics as a function of parameters that define the electromagnetic response of a medium .",
    "note that while mos@xmath0 is selected as our representative tmdc , we also carry out numerical calculations with other commonly known compounds of this family such as wse@xmath0 and compare their optical behaviour . to begin",
    ", we consider a model structure wherein the mos@xmath0 sheet is located at the interface of two dielectric films and show using the transfer matrix formalism that the optical response of embedded mos@xmath0 is largely dependent on the nature of dielectrics , incident angle , and wavelength of the incident electromagnetic ( em ) wave .",
    "this dependence is quantitatively expressed through the transmission and reflection spectrum using transfer matrices that relate the amplitudes of electric and magnetic fields of the incident em wave propagating across the two optical media separated by the mos@xmath0 sheet .",
    "we stress that the nature of dielectrics come in to play since their intrinsic non - linearity is explicitly accounted for in our calculations .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that while every dielectric demonstrates a certain degree of non - linearity in their response to an electromagnetic disturbance , for most part the corrections are ignored ; however , to explain phenomena , for instance , optical bistability  @xcite and hysteresis of reflected light  @xcite , it becomes necessary to seek recourse to an em field dependent dielectric constant .",
    "@xcite    the rationale behind a survey of the non - linear optical properties is grounded in the fact that it paves the way for tuning the behaviour of 2d materials to modulate the amplitude of an optical signal for desired photonic applications . while a diverse set of photonic functionalities such as reverse saturable absorption , two - photon and free - carrier absorption , and nonlinear refraction can be achieved through a dynamic control employing an active feedback mechanism , the inherent non - linearity as part of the physical characteristic of the material ensures that response times to an em disturbance are not hindered by a low rate of signal transmission between the foundational modules .",
    "the overall device architecture with passive design components can potentially be very simple and fast and crucial for manipulating short optical pulses . for a detailed overview of the practicality of optical structures",
    "whose operation is aided by non - linear behaviour , we refer the reader to ref .  .",
    "to keep things tractable and amenable to analytic derivations , the dielectrics in our model are assumed to conform to the kerr - type classification .",
    "we also note that in addition to the response of the optical medium , the electronic structure of the tmdc mono - layer marks its imprint on the passage of an incident electromagnetic wave by virtue of its intrinsic surface conductivity ; an estimate of the conductivity of tmdc mono - layer for use in our calculations is performed in the inter - band regime using the kubo formalism from linear response theory .",
    "@xcite it is relevant to mention however , that several low - energy optical transitions in mono - layer tmdcs are attributed to excitons ( mostly bound to impurities ) which are relatively stable in these materials because of high hole and electron effective masses .",
    "however , in this paper we focus exclusively on optical conductivity that arises from an inter - band transition in a pristine tmdcs mono - layer and choose to ignore the excitonic contributions .    throughout this study , to evaluate the optical behaviour of our proposed arrangement , we draw attention of the reader to 1 ) the role of non - linear coefficients that characterize the dielectrics , 2 ) the electronic structure of the mono - layer tmdc sheet  @xcite that absorbs a part of the incident wave underscoring its value in regulating the inter - band optical conductivity and 3 ) possible design metrics that could enhance light - matter interaction  @xcite in transition metal dichalcogenide nano - sheets . in particular , we theoretically demonstrate that there exists a critical angle which is intensity - dependent and is conspicuous by a sharp dip in the reflection coefficient .",
    "the sharp dip marks the onset of normal transmission from total internal reflection as the intensity of the incident light beam goes beyond the threshold value .",
    "the passage of light is also shown to be governed by the inter - band optical conductivity ( which is a direct outcome of the energy dispersion ) of the embedded tmdc mono - layer , hence , for a comparative examination , we choose for the embedded layer mos@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 as representative tmdcs .",
    "these compounds which have almost identical band parameters but a widely different spin - orbit coupling does not manifest as enhanced inter - band optical conductivity and the overall percentage of reflected and transmitted light stays practically unaltered .",
    "however , seeking recourse to an external perturbation such as bi - axial mechanical strain in the tmdc mono - layer offers additional control by modulating the reflected and transmitted light and also adjusts the intensity - dependent critical angle .",
    "the attenuation and transmission of light is therefore not only an upshot of ambient conditions and other vital parameters including the angle of incidence , but also , crucially depends on a strong light - matter interaction .",
    "the tmdc nanostructure .",
    "a closing summary offers suggested enhancements to the presented work , especially in connection to the kerr non - linearity assisted phenomenon of optical bistability that is actively pursued as a pathway to greater integration of nano - photonic circuits with mainstream semiconductor electronics .",
    "proofs of analytic calculations left out in the main body of the text are collected in two appendices .",

    "[ reflpl ] gives a different critical angle in each case which is borne out by the dip in the reflectance coefficient at two discrete intensities . as a possible application of this behaviour",
    ", we can conceive of applications where it is expedient to harness the intensity of light as an external tunable parameter and modulate the flow of light .",
    "we also like to comment on the role of spin - orbit coupling in splitting the valence bands that yield two optical band gaps as noted at the beginning of this section .",
    "note that the optical band gap is one of the material parameters that regulates the inter - band optical conductivity , which based on eqs .",
    "[ rcff ] and  [ tcff ] , determines the final reflectance and transmission coefficients .",
    "the reflectance traces for both the tmdc mono - layers corresponding to the two optical gaps ( marked as _ up _ and _ down _ on fig .",
    "[ reflpl ] ) are indistinguishable for over the full range of incident intensities which allows us to conclude that the complex inter - band conductivities are sufficiently close .",
    "further , the relatively large spin - splitting in wse@xmath0 ( three - fold higher than mos@xmath0 ) notwithstanding , the reflectance coefficients when a mono - layer of this tmdc is inserted at the interface of linear and non - linear dielectric is very comparable to those obtained with mos@xmath0 .",
    "the higher spin - orbit coupling in wse@xmath0 does not translate in to a significant increase in the inter - band optical conductivity .",
    "in fact , to test our reasoning , we artificially augmented the conductivity of wse@xmath0 by a factor of three - halves to observe a clear increase in the attendant reflectance plots over their mos@xmath0 counterparts .",
    "it therefore suffices to say that influences which reinforce or impede the inter - band conductivity serve to moderate the optical response of the tmdc mono - layer .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling for semiconducting tmdcs is , however , not such an influence .",
    "an additional note about the polarization of incident light is in order here : the @xmath4 and @xmath5 edge of the brillouin zone in mono - layer tmdc are energy degenerate and time - reversed counterparts .",
    "a circularly polarized light aligns with a specific spin ( see fig .",
    "[ tvps ] ) to excite optical transition exclusively at one of the valley edges , for instance , a right circularly - polarized light will excite electrons at @xmath4 but not @xmath5 .",
    "since we have chosen a linearly - polarized beam which in principle can be decomposed in a right- and left - circularly polarized component , optical transitions happen at both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a liearly - polarized beam of frequency that matches one of the transition gaps will promote an electron to the conduction state at both valley edges .     and @xmath5 in the brillouin zone of a mono - layer tmdc with opposite spins .",
    "the valley edges undergo a selective optical transition when an incident beam of definite circular - polarization shines on the mono - layer . a right- ( left- ) circularly polarized beam excites an electron from the @xmath136 edge .",
    "note that this spin and valley optical selection rule is governed by the principle of conservation of angular momentum and time reversal symmetry . ]    the preceding analysis of intensity - modulated reflection and transmission can also be carried out when the incident light beam travels from a rarer to denser medium .",
    "for the arrangement shown in fig .",
    "[ schema ] , this turns the non - linear dielectric in to a the denser medium .",
    "the phenomenon of total internal reflection is absent and the reflectance plots therefore do not display a drop ( fig .  [ rtdpl ] ) but instead show a declining trend with increased intensity levels .",
    "note that a higher intensity level enhances the non - linear refractive index and the medium is more optically dense . for a numerical answer",
    ", we set @xmath137 to 1.5 while @xmath123 remains unaltered .    .",
    "the arrows on the plot refer to spin - up and spin - down and point to the reflection coefficients for an optical transition that may happen from the top of the lower ( upper ) spin - down ( up ) valence band to bottom of the conduction band at @xmath4 or @xmath5 valley - edge of the brillouin zone . ]    for a targeted application , the optical response can be externally tuned either by a careful impregnation of impurities at the time of growth or suitable structural modifications .",
    "as for the broad structural and electronic behaviour of mono - layer tmdc , they are generally well reflected by the set of parameters given in table .",
    "[ table1 ] . while the spin - orbit coupling is intrinsic to the material , determined primarily by size of the nucleus and thus immune to most perturbations including the often employed external strain , the other band parameters listed in table .  [ table1 ] could be suitably amended .",
    "in fact , strain - engineering has been carried out previously on tmdc devices  @xcite and predict improved performance characteristics . in our work , we utilize results from a first - principles based calculation by mandiaki _",
    "et al . _ who explicitly tabulate the change in energy band gap ( and the dielectric constants ) for mono - layer tmdcs .",
    "@xcite one of their findings shows that mono - layer mos@xmath0 transitions to an indirect semiconductor for isotropic and uniaxial strain while wse@xmath0 retains its direct band gap character under tensile isotropic and low values of uniaxial strain . as an illustration of the possibility to engineer optical response through external strain , we consider an isotropic and @xmath138 tensile - strained wse@xmath0 sheet .",
    "the relevant direct band gap at @xmath4 for the strained case is @xmath139 ( the pristine value is @xmath140 ) and the hopping parameter @xmath10 in eq .",
    "[ mos2ham ] is empirically scaled down by the factor @xmath141 to @xmath142 while the new lattice constant is @xmath143 .",
    "we plot the reflectance coefficient in fig .",
    "[ reflstr ] for this case and immediately notice that it is lower than the corresponding unstrained mono - layer wse@xmath126 and the transition to normal transmission from total internal reflection happens at a higher incident intensity .",
    "the reflectance is restored when the angle of incidence is changed to @xmath144 though the threshold intensity at which total internal reflection ends is higher than the unstrained case .",
    "we have noted before that the intensity - governed kerr non - linearity determines the critical angle at which normal transmission takes over from total internal reflection ; however , the presence of a tmdc sheet by virtue of its surface conductivity which changes under strain influences this shift as evident from fig .",
    "[ reflstr ] . the surface conductivity , therefore , in addition , to incident light intensity , and the kerr coefficient of non - linearity allows an external adjustment of the passage of light through the proposed arrangement of fig .  [ schema ] .",
    "is displayed for two angles of incidence , @xmath133 and @xmath145 .",
    "the introduction of strained wse@xmath0 readjusts the critical angle as compared to the unstrained case shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ reflpl ] at which the system switches from total internal reflection to normal transmission .",
    "the optical parameters for this figure are the ones defined at the beginning of section .",
    "we have theoretically obtained the behaviour of a linearly - polarized light beam incident at the interface of a linear and non - linear dielectric . in addition , the interface is covered by a sheet of mono - layer tmdc that mediates the transmission of light through its inter - band optical conductivity .",
    "the final reflectance and transmittance coefficients were determined by resorting to a transfer matrix approach and the inter - band optical conductivity of mono - layer tmdc was quantitatively calculated with the kubo formalism .",
    "significantly , for a beam of light traveling from an optically denser medium with a linear dielectric behaviour to an optically rarer kerr - type region , a threshold intensity level exists for which the system switches from total internal reflection to normal transmission .",
    "this switch is a reminder that for the kerr - type dielectric described by eq .",
    "[ knl ] , the critical angle is not a simple reproduction of snell s law but instead is intensity - dependent .",
    "no such switch is observed though for a light beam that traverses an optically rarer medium with linear dielectric in to the denser kerr - region .",
    "further our choice of two different mono - layers of tmdcs , mos@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 , because of their near - identical band parameters but widely varying spin - orbit coupling does not display any noticeable change in the reflectance pattern .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in wse@xmath0 though three - fold higher than mos@xmath0 is a relatively low number to significantly impact the inter - band conductivity and the overall reflectance pattern .",
    "however , we find that external perturbations such as mechanical strain in mono - layer tmdcs with adjustments to the angle of incidence can tune the light propagation in our setup , reflected in a shift of the reflectance coefficients .",
    "further , other variants of strain as dominant perturbations including uniaxial and shear in addition to the tensile strain utilized in this work , in principle , allow us to adapt the optical response through an alteration of their inter - band optical conductivity .",
    "the use of a non - linear medium also allows us to examine several optical phenomena that we havent explored in this work .",
    "in particular , the phenomenon of optical bistability  @xcite by which an optical medium has two possible optical outputs for a unique optical input , holds promise for the efficient integration of high - speed photonic circuitry to nanoscale electronics and a full optical control over switches  @xcite , logic gates , and memory chips .",
    "@xcite a simple way to observe non - linearity is through introduction of a functional non - linear material with an intensity - dependent refractive index .",
    "this phenomenon to which we have alluded in section .",
    "[ kerrd ] is the kerr effect and is an inherently weak effect requiring considerable power densities to fully manifest . in this work , while we havent attributed any non - linearity to the tmdc mono - layer that covers the interface of a linear and kerr- ( non - linear ) type dielectric and chosen to focus on the mediation of the passage of light by virtue of its inter - band surface conductivity , the 2d surface of tmdc , however , can significantly localize light  @xcite and enhance the optical fields .",
    "we believe it would be a highly compelling study to investigate the non - linearity of tmdcs inside optical resonating cavities of the fabry - perot type . before closing , it must be mentioned that while we have used the semiconducting mono - layer mos@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 as typical representatives of two - dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides from a wide range of available compounds ,  @xcite it would certainly be worthwhile to assess the optical response of other recently discovered two - dimensional materials such as phosphorene and stanene .    this work was supported in part by the bu photonics center and u.s .",
