    "recently optical quantum - information processing has been developed rapidly both theoretically and experimentally , where photonic entanglement , especially multiphoton entanglement  @xcite plays a crucial role not only in the fundamental tests of quantum nonlocality  @xcite , but also in optical quantum computation  @xcite and quantum teleportation  @xcite , multiparty communication  @xcite , quantum key distribution  @xcite . as we know",
    ", two - photon maximally entangled state , or bell state , can violate the bell inequality  @xcite to show the inconsistency between quantum mechanics ( qm ) and local reality ( lr ) theory , and so far there are numerous experiments to verify the validity of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , entanglement of more than two photons , i.e. , multiphoton maximally entangled state , or ghz state  @xcite can demonstrate the conflicts deterministically and nonstatistically , which are stronger and more straightforward than two - photon entanglement .",
    "several groups have experimentally realized the creation and manipulation of multiphoton entanglement , from three - photon  @xcite , four - photon  @xcite , five - photon  @xcite to six - photon  @xcite entanglement .",
    "however , all of the reported multiphoton entangled sources so far are hard to be applied to long - distance quantum communication due to the limited intensity of the sources .    in this letter , we report a high intensity of three - photon polarization - entangled source following the proposal by rarity and tapster @xcite .",
    "it is brighter than the intensities of publicly reported three - photon entanglement in all the previous experiments so far .",
    "although in our experiment we use the same techniques as the previous experiments of multiphoton entanglement , here we obtain brighter three - photon entanglement with better quality through careful improvements and optimizations .",
    "our results suggest that the three - photon entangled source can be used for multiparty long - distance quantum communication .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the cw @xmath2 nm all solid - state green laser ( millennia pro 10s , newport co. ) pumps the mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( tsunami , newport co. ) and generates femtosecond pulses at the central wavelength of @xmath3 nm , with a repetition rate of @xmath4mhz and a pulse width of @xmath5fs . in the experiment ,",
    "the power of pump laser is @xmath6w and the output power of pulsed red laser is @xmath7w .",
    "then the pulsed laser passes through the lib@xmath8o@xmath9 ( lbo ) crystal to produce ultraviolet ( uv ) laser at the central wavelength of @xmath10 nm after the up - conversion process .",
    "a lens is inserted before the lbo crystal to form a small focused beam on the crystal and improve the up - conversion efficiency .",
    "since the output beam from the laser is elliptical , we use the combination of two cylindrical lens to reshape the beam to be circular . due to the limited efficiency of up - conversion , the beam after the lbo crystal is mixed by the uv and unconverted red laser . in order to effectively separate them , five dichroic mirrors ( dm ) , which can reflect uv laser while transmitting red laser ,",
    "the power of the transmitted unconverted @xmath3 nm laser from the first dm is more than @xmath11mw .",
    "it is strongly attenuated by a series of attenuators to simulate a single - photon source ( sps ) .",
    "the uv laser of @xmath12mw traverses a @xmath13-mm - thickness @xmath14-bab@xmath15o@xmath16 ( bbo ) crystal to generate polarization - entangled photon pairs owing to the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion  @xcite . through optimizing the collection efficiency",
    ", the observed count rate of photon pairs is more than @xmath17khz , with a compensator composed of a half - wave - plate and a @xmath18-mm - thickness bbo crystal , and a @xmath19 nm bandwidth interferometer filter ( if ) in each side .",
    "the prepared two - photon polarization - entangled state can be written as @xmath20 present horizontal and vertical polarization of photons respectively . during the experiment , the visibility of two - photon entangled state is @xmath21 in the h / v basis while @xmath22 in the + /-",
    "basis , with @xmath23 .",
    "the polarization of a single photon in path 3 is fixed at @xmath24 and sent to a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) , which transmits horizontal polarization while reflecting vertical polarization .",
    "after carefully adjusting the position of the prism controlled by a precise stepper motor , photon 2 and photon 3 can be completely overlapped on the pbs both spatially and temporally . when the polarization of the two photons is identical , we can prepare the three - photon ghz entanglement as follows : @xmath25(a ) , where the undesired components are much less than the desired coincidences of h@xmath26v@xmath27v@xmath8 and v@xmath26h@xmath15h@xmath8 . in order to confirm the coherent superposition of the three - photon ghz state and observe the two - photon interference effect  @xcite",
    ", we first move the position of the prism and then perform the coincident measurement on the three photons in the + /-",
    "basis , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "we have emphasized that the ghz state can explicitly show the conflicts between qm and lr .",
    "consider the following four joint measurements on the three - photon ghz state : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the pauli operators , which can be experimentally measured in the + /-",
    "and r / l basis , respectively , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , we can easily measure the above four joint operators , e.g. , @xmath32 implies that photon 1 is measured in the + /-",
    "basis while photon 2 and photon 3 are both measured in the r / l basis simultaneously",
    ". then we can experimentally test the bell - mermin inequality  @xcite by @xmath33 qm and lr will predict completely different results for this inequality with @xmath34 predicted by any lr theory can not be larger than 2 .",
    "we verify this by performing polarization measurements on the state .",
    "for example , to measure the expectation value of the @xmath35 operator , eight sorts of polarization settings ( @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) must be performed .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the experimental value of @xmath38 is @xmath39 , which shows a violation of lr with more than 260 standard deviations .",
    "this also indicates that the prepared state in the experiment is a genuine ghz state .",
    "in fact , except for using the bell - mermin inequality to validate the ghz entanglement , there are some other approaches to characterize the multipartite entanglement such as quantum state tomography , entanglement witness .",
    "we can quantify the quality of the produced ghz state by evaluating the fidelity as defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the density matrix of the produced state .",
    "the fidelity can be determined by the local measurements on individual qubits .",
    "the experimental expectation value of fidelity is @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we can use the following entanglement witness operator  abls01 to detect the ghz entanglement : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an identity operator and @xmath45 is a projection operator to the ghz state . if the expectation value of this witness operator is negative , it implies the existence of genuine ghz entanglement .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath46 is @xmath47 whose experimental value is @xmath48 , which is negative with about 155 standard deviations .",
    "this clearly proves the prepared state is truly entangled .",
    "the single - photon source in path 3 is not a strictly true single - photon emitter , but a weak coherent laser .",
    "the mean photon number @xmath49 of the sps will dominate the intensity of the three - photon entangled source .",
    "higher @xmath50 will increase the intensity while decrease the visibility of the entangled source .",
    "thus optimization of the @xmath49 value is necessary . here",
    "we give a detailed analysis , see fig .",
    "the total count rates emitted from the sps and einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs are @xmath51where @xmath52 is the repetition frequency of the optical pulses , i.e. , @xmath4mhz , and @xmath53 is the probability of down - conversion per pulse in the nonlinear crystal . for simplicity , we assume that the coupling efficiencies of the three paths are equal , say , @xmath54 , and the detection efficiencies of the three detectors are also equal , say , @xmath55 , and the term of @xmath56 is omitted",
    ". then we can estimate the detected count rates of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 from the sps , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 from the epr , respectively , given by @xmath66where we assume that the pbs is ideal and the insertion losses of other optical components are negligible . in the count rate of @xmath67 ,",
    "the factor of @xmath68 is due to the consideration of poisson distribution ( the generation probability of two photons from the sps is @xmath69 ) , and the four sorts of distributions of the two photons from the sps ( @xmath70 ) result in the factor of @xmath71 in @xmath72 .",
    "when photon @xmath73 and photon @xmath74 are both @xmath75 or @xmath76 polarization , and the two photons are completely overlapped on the pbs , the three - photon ghz entangled state can be created and its count rate is @xmath77    except the above two components , the other six sorts of the undesired components will also contribute to the threefold coincidences .",
    "when @xmath78 photons are transmitted while @xmath58 photons are reflected by the pbs , it will produce the following coincidence : @xmath79}{f }   \\nonumber   \\label{hvh } \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{8}fp_{e}\\mu ^{2}\\eta _ { c}^{3}\\eta _ { d}^{3}.\\end{aligned}\\]]similarly , when @xmath80 photons and @xmath61 photons pass the pbs it can cause the other two components @xmath81the other undesired components of @xmath82 , @xmath83 can also cause the following coincidence @xmath84    we can define a parameter @xmath85 as the ratio of the desired coincidences to the undesired coincidences @xmath86 obviously , when @xmath85 is larger the visibility of the ghz state will be better . when @xmath87 , @xmath85 will reach the maximum value and the visibility of the three - photon entangled state is the best .",
    "we experimentally verify this theoretical result through controlling the @xmath88 value of the sps .",
    "we find out when @xmath89 the visibility of the entangled state can reach a quite good value . while during the experiment , we estimate @xmath90 and @xmath91 in path 3 is @xmath92 , therefore the theoretical value of @xmath93 is @xmath94 .",
    "the variance between the theoretical and experimental values is mainly due to that the calibration for the coupling efficiency in path 3 is not precise .",
    "if @xmath88 is increased over the optimal value , the intensity of the three - photon entangled source is also increased with the cost of the decrease of the visibility .",
    "we observe the intensity to be more than @xmath95hz with a few percentages of visibility degradation , which is larger than the intensity in the first three - photon experiment  @xcite with more than four orders of magnitude . on the other hand , in the experiment we have tried to improve the pump of the laser system up to the maximum power , @xmath96w . through careful optimization",
    ", the uv power can be increased to @xmath97mw and the intensity of two - photon entangled pairs is close to @xmath98khz , which also implies that we can boost the intensity of the three - photon entangled source up to @xmath99khz with a moderate visibility",
    ". however , the laser system can not be stable with this pump power for long - term experiment .",
    "this high intensity of three - photon entangled source is very valuable for many multiparty quantum communication protocols  @xcite and other applications in quantum - information processing  bez00 .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally implemented a bright three - photon polarization - entangled source and tested the bell - mermin inequality to show the conflicts between quantum mechanics and local realism .",
    "we also introduce an entanglement witness operator to characterize three - photon ghz entanglement .",
    "further , we analyze the theory of visibility optimization , which is proven by the experimental results .",
    "the implementation of a high intensity of three - photon entangled source is a significant step towards practical long - distance multiparty quantum communication in the future .",
