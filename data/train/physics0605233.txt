    "high particle multiplicity is an important feature to be considered in detector designs for high energy heavy ion collision experiments . in @xmath4",
    "gev au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , the average charged particle multiplicity @xmath5 is 170  @xcite .",
    "therefore , average charged particle density is 0.03  @xmath6 at a distance of 30  cm from the vertex .",
    "additionally , experiments at rhic are performed at a high event rate of about 10  khz and the charged particle rate is 300  cps/@xmath7 at a distance of 30  cm from the vertex .",
    "this harsh environment demands highly efficient central tracking detectors .",
    "a wide variety of observables are measured in high energy heavy ion collision experiments : such as charged particle multiplicities , yield ratios and spectra of identified hadrons , elliptic flow , suppression of high @xmath8 particle production and heavy flavor production  @xcite .",
    "therefore , several particular features are required for the detectors used .",
    "a relatively wide transverse momentum range ( @xmath9  0.220  gev/@xmath10 ) is required to be covered to take in the broad interests of high energy heavy ion collisions and the magnetic field should be kept low ( @xmath111  t ) . however , good momentum resolution of @xmath12  ( gev/@xmath10)@xmath13 is required for future measurements , such as the @xmath14 state measurement at rhic - ii  @xcite . to achieve such good momentum resolution with a magnetic field of 1  t , a 1-m radius solenoidal tracker with spatial resolution of @xmath11200",
    "@xmath3 m is needed .",
    "double track resolution is also required to be better than 1  cm to cope with the high particle multiplicity .",
    "such high flux operational and multi hit capabilities have recently also been required in particle physics experiments  @xcite .",
    "one of the candidates as a detector that satisfies the above requirements is a combination of a time projection chamber ( tpc ) , a sophisticated detector for particle tracking and particle identification , and micro patter gas detectors ( mpgds )  @xcite such as gas electron multipliers ( gems )  @xcite .",
    "although existing wire chambers need gating wires to collect positive ions and have limitations in their double track resolution by the wire spacing , the novel structure of a gem has the following advantages in its application to tpc readout :    * two dimensional symmetry of the gem structure provides a large flexibility in the readout geometry .",
    "* large areas can be covered with a low amount of material since support mechanics for a gem are simple . *",
    "the intense electric field region will be limited inside the holes and the * e*@xmath15*b * effect is expected to be reduced .",
    "( in a strong magnetic field , this effect results in a broadening of the electron cloud and a worsening of the resolution . )",
    "* the signal of the readout pad is induced by amplified electrons , and is spatially narrow and fast .",
    "* the generated ions do not affect the signal and the ion tail of the signal will be suppressed . *",
    "the positive ion feedback into the drift region can be suppressed by a factor of about 10 due to the electric field around the gem holes and so gating wires might be unnecessary .",
    "therefore , a tpc using a gem for signal amplification ( gem - tpc ) may achieve high rate capability as well as excellent double track and spatial resolution .",
    "a gem - tpc is a strong candidate to be a central tracking detector in high energy heavy ion collision experiments  @xcite .",
    "a gem - tpc prototype , consisting of an end cap chamber , a gas vessel and a field cage , was developed  @xcite .",
    "photographs of the gem - tpc prototype are shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig_2 ] shows a schematic view of the gem - tpc .",
    "the end cap chamber mounts a triple gem ( the effective area is @xmath16  @xmath7 ) on readout pads .",
    "the triple gem was constructed from gem foils made at cern  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , the gap between neighboring gems was 2  mm and the gap between the bottom gem and the pads was 1.5  mm .",
    "high voltages are applied to the triple gem through connectors penetrating the end cap chamber with a resistor chain . when the voltage across the gems ( @xmath17 ) is 360  v , the electric fields in the transfer region and the induction region are @xmath18=360  v/2  mm=1.8  kv / cm and @xmath19=360  v/1.5  mm=2.4",
    "kv / cm , respectively .",
    "the operated drift electric field is shown in table  [ table_1 ] .",
    "two kinds of readout pads with different shapes , rectangle and chevron ( zigzag ) , were used to study the dependence of the spatial resolution on shape ( see fig .  [ fig_3 ] ) . since",
    "chevron pads may increase the number of hits on pads by charge sharing , chevron pads are expected to have better spatial resolution than rectangular ones  @xcite .",
    "both kinds of pads , both made of gold - plated copper , have the same area of @xmath20  mm@xmath21 and the same pitch of 1.27  mm .",
    "relatively narrow width pads are required for charge sharing for small diffusion gases such as cf@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "10 columns for both rectangular and chevron pads .",

    "additional resistors are placed to match the voltage at the bottom of the field cage with the surface voltage of the top gem .",
    "the gas vessel is made of aluminum plates and has a volume of @xmath26  @xmath22 .      a charge sensitive preamplifier , consisting of two kinds of operational amplifiers ( ad8058 and ad8132 , analog devices , inc . )",
    ", was used for the gem - tpc .",
    "its time constant is @xmath27s and its effective gain @xmath28 .",
    "the gain of the preamplifier was determined from the expected signal amplitude and the dynamic range ( @xmath29  v ) of a flash adc ( fadc ) module ( rpv-160 , repic co. , ltd . ) .",
    "the resolution and the sampling rate of the fadc are 8  bits and 100  mhz , respectively .",
    "signals from 24 pads ( 3 rows  @xmath15  8 columns ) are transmitted from the preamplifiers to the fadcs through 8-m shielded twisted cables .",
    "three kinds of gases with different properties , a mixture of argon(ar)(90%)-methane(ch@xmath0)(10% ) ( commonly called p10 ) , a mixture of argon(ar)(70%)-ethane(c@xmath1h@xmath2)(30% ) and pure tetrafluoromethane(cf@xmath0)(99.999% ) gas , were used to study the performance of the gem - tpc .",

    "drift velocities and diffusion coefficients were calculated by magboltz . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      one of the advantages of the gem - tpc is its ion feedback suppression .",
    "the effect of ion feedback on gem - tpc performance was studied by measuring the beam rate dependence of the detection efficiency and spatial resolution .",
    "the beam rate was determined by the beam slit width and the rate was monitored with the s2 scintillator ( 2.5@xmath152.5  @xmath7 ) .",
    "the beams of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 at a momentum of 2  gev/@xmath10 and ar - ch@xmath0 gas were used , while the drift length was 85  mm .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_11 ] .",
    "the results of the detection efficiency and the spatial resolution in the previous subsections were obtained with a beam rate of @xmath33  cps/@xmath7 . at the maximum beam rate of 4800  cps/@xmath7 , the detection efficiency and the spatial resolution",
    "were worsened by factors of 2.5@xmath340.5% and 11@xmath343% , respectively .",
    "the maximum total beam rate in the active gem - tpc region was in the order of 10@xmath35  cps .        this result is worse than the results from the other research group with beams of 1.5@xmath36  cps/@xmath7  @xcite . because of the limited readout area of our gem - tpc ( 1@xmath153.6  @xmath7 ) , it was not possible to fully distinguish double tracks , which worsened the detection efficiency and the spatial resolution .",
    "the beam rate exceeds the typical rates in @xmath37=200  gev au+au collisions at rhic and @xmath37=5.5  tev pb+pb collisions at lhc , which are 300  cps/@xmath7 and 1400  cps/@xmath7 , respectively , at a distance of 30  cm from the vertex . since 4800",
    "cps/@xmath7 is much larger than these numbers , the effect of the ion feedback on the gem - tpc performance can be regarded as negligible for our purpose .",
    "energy losses , @xmath38 , were measured for positrons , muons , pions , protons and deuterons in a beam momentum range of 0.53.0  gev/@xmath10 to evaluate the particle identification capability . in this measurement ,",
    "the drift length was 85  mm and ar - ch@xmath0 was used .",
    "the summation of pulse heights for 3 pad rows is regarded as the energy loss .",
    "since there was a time variation in the gem gain ( 30% peak to peak , for 5 hours ) , the measured value of the mean pulse height , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , was corrected with pions at each momentum to eliminate the effect of this time variation as follows .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 is the corrected mean pulse height and @xmath43 is the expected mean pulse height .",
    "figure  [ fig_12 ] shows the corrected mean pulse heights and curves of the expected mean pulse heights .",
    "as previously mentioned , the gain variation may be due to the change of @xmath44 .",
    "another candidate as a reason for the gain variation is the charging - up of the insulator of a gem foil  @xcite .        to estimate the particle identification capability of a large gem - tpc",
    ", a monte - carlo simulation was performed using measured pulse height spectra for 1-gev/@xmath10 pions and protons . to improve the energy resolution , a truncated mean method , where 2/7 of the pad rows having the largest signals are removed , was used .",
    "energy resolution of pions will be 9% and the pion rejection factor with 99% proton efficiency is expected to be 200 with a 50-cm track length .",
    "this energy resolution is comparable with that of the star tpc ( 8% ) with a track length of more than 67  cm  @xcite .",
    "a gem - tpc prototype was constructed to develop a tracking detector for use in high event rate and high particle multiplicity environments in high energy heavy ion collisions .    to evaluate the performance of the gem - tpc",
    ", a beam test was performed at kek .",
    "detection efficiency of @xmath4599.3% was achieved with 3 kinds of gases , ar(90%)-ch@xmath0(10% ) , ar(70%)-c@xmath1h@xmath2(30% ) and cf@xmath0",
    ". spatial resolution of 79  @xmath3 m in the pad row direction and 313  @xmath3 m in the drift direction was achieved with ar - c@xmath1h@xmath2 and rectangular pads for 13-mm drift .",
