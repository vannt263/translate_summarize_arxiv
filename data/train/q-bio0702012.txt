    "extensive interest has recently been devoted to the understanding of molecular motors , which play pivotal roles in cellular processes by performing mechanical work using the energy - driven conformational changes .",
    "kinesin , myosin , f@xmath2-atpase , groel , rna polymerase , and ribosome belong to a group of biological machines that undergoes a series of conformational changes during the mechanochemical cycle where the molecular conformation is directly coupled to the chemical state of the ligand . although substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the underlying physical principles that govern molecular motors during the last decade , major issues still remain to be resolved .",
    "specifically , some of the outstanding questions are as follows : ( a ) how is the chemical energy converted into mechanical work ? ( b ) how is the directionality of the molecular movement determined ?",
    "( c ) how is the molecular movement coordinated or regulated ?",
    "several biochemical experiments have quantified the kinetic steps @xcite , single molecule experiments using optical tweezers have measured the mechanical response of individual molecular motors @xcite , and an increasing number of crystal structures have provided glimpses into the mechanisms of molecular motors @xcite .",
    "these experimental evidences , however , are not sufficient to fully address all the questions above .",
    "for example , little is known not only about the structural details of each chemical state but also about the kinetic pathways connecting them .",
    "hence , if feasible , a computational strategy using the coordinates from x - ray and/or nmr structures can shed light on the allosteric dynamics of molecular motors .",
    "although some initial numerical studies @xcite have proceeded towards addressing issue ( a ) for a few cases where both open and closed structures are _ explicitly known _ , no previous attempt has been made to answer issue ( c ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate this question in the context of the conventional kinesin where the mechanochemical coordination of the motor movement is best manifested among the motor proteins .",
    "one of the experimentally best studied molecular motors is the conventional kinesin ( kinesin-1 ) @xcite , a relatively small sized motor protein that transports cellular materials by walking in an unidirectional hand - over - hand manner along the microtubule ( mt ) filaments . compared to other motor proteins involved in material transport such as myosin and dynein",
    ", the conventional kinesin has a remarkable processivity , which can travel about a hundred ( @xmath38.2 @xmath4 ) steps without being dissociated from the mt .",
    "the mechanochemical cycle conjectured from experiments suggests that there must be a dynamic coordination between the two motor domains in order to achieve such high processivity .",
    "the quest to identify the origin of this dynamic coordination has drawn extensive attention among the kinesin community .",
    "since hancock and howard @xcite first hypothesized that the `` internal strain '' was needed for processivity , the strain - dependent mechanochemistry became a popular subject in kinesin studies @xcite .",
    "with the aid of optical tweezers , guydosh and block recently revisited this issue by monitoring the real - time kinesin dynamics in the presence of atp and @xmath5 , a tight binding atp analog @xcite .",
    "they discovered that , when @xmath5 was bound to the kinesin , the pause - time of the step increased substantially and that the normal step was restored only after the obligatory backstep .",
    "this suggests that @xmath5 is released only when the head bound with @xmath5 becomes the leading head ( l ) .",
    "supported by this observation , they advocated a kinetic model in which the rearward strain via the neck - linker facilitates the release of the ligand from the l @xcite .",
    "stated differently , the binding of the ligand to the l is inhibited because the rearward strain constitutes an unfavorable environment for the atp binding sites of the l. in the present study , we focus on the elucidation of the structural origin of the coordinated motion in kinesin by adopting a simple computational strategy",
    ".    better straightforward evidence of the regulation on the nucleotide binding site can be obtained when a structure in which both kinesin heads are simultaneously bound to the mt binding site is determined .",
    "such a structure will allow us to identify the structural differences between the leading ( l ) and the trailing ( t ) head .",
    "to date , this structure , however , has not yet been reported .",
    "the only available structures include an isolated kinesin-1 without the mt @xcite , an isolated single - headed kinesin - like ( kif1a ) with various ligand states @xcite , and a single kif1a bound to the tubulin - dimer binding site @xcite .",
    "therefore , we utilized existing protein data bank ( pdb ) structures and manually built a model system of the two - headed kinesin molecule with both heads bound to the tubulin binding sites ( see fig.2 and legend ) . this model was used to generate an ensemble of structures via simulations . a direct comparison between the l and t equilibrium structures shows that the tension built on the neck - linker induces the disruption of the nucleotide binding site of the l , which directly supports inferences from experimental observations @xcite .",
    "* mechanochemical cycle of kinesin : * we begin by reviewing the mechanochemical cycle of kinesin molecule on the mt to clarify the importance of dynamic coordination between the two motor domains for kinesin processivity .",
    "recent experiments using laser optical tweezers ( lot ) , cryo - electron microscopy , electron paramagnetic resonance , and fret , as well as the crystal structures at various states @xcite provide glimpses into the structural and dynamical details of how the kinesin molecule walks on the microbubule filaments . depending on the nucleotide state at the binding site , both the motor domain structure and the binding interface between kinesin and mt are affected .",
    "in particular , a minor change of the motor domain coupled to the nucleotide is amplified to a substantial conformational change of the neck linker between the ordered and the disordered state .",
    "experimental studies strongly suggest the mechanochemical cycle shown in fig.1 @xcite .",
    "the mechanical stepping cycle of kinesin initiates with the binding of atp to the empty kinesin head strongly bound to the mt [ @xmath6 .",
    "docking of the neck linker to the neck - linker binding motif on the leading head ( x in fig.1 ) propels the trailing head ( y in fig.1 ) in the ( + ) -direction of mt , which leads to an 8 @xmath4 mechanical step [ @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction with the mt facilitates the dissociation of adp from the catalytic core of l [ @xmath8 .",
    "atp is hydrolyzed and produces @xmath9 state for the t [ @xmath10 . when @xmath11 is released and the trailing head is unbound from the mt , the half - cycle is completed [ @xmath12 .",
    "the mechanical step is achieved in a hand - over - hand fashion by alternating the binding of the two motor domains ( x and y in fig.1 ) to the mt @xcite .",
    "high processivity of the kinesin requires this kinetic cycle to be stable ( remain within the yellow box in fig.1 ) .",
    "a premature binding of the atp to the leading head in the state of @xmath13 should be prevented , i.e. , the condition @xmath14/(k_r^{(iii)}+k_{diss}^{(iii)})$ ] and @xmath15/(k_r^{(iv)}+k_{diss}^{(iv)})\\rightarrow 0 $ ] should be satisfied in fig.1 ( see supporting information for the master equation describing the kinetic cycle ) .",
    "atp binding to the ( iii ) or ( iv ) states can destroy the mechanochemical cycle of the kinesin .",
    "the binding of atp on the leading head should be suppressed before the @xmath16-@xmath11 is released from the t. otherwise , both heads become adp - bound states , which have a weak binding affinity to the mt , and that leads to dissociation from the mt .",
    "since the kinesin has a high processivity compared to other molecular motors , effective communication is required between the two heads regarding the chemical state of each of the partner motor domains . + * two - headed kinesin bound to the microtubule : * in the absence of interactions with the mt , the individual kinesin monomers fold into identical conformations . to achieve its biological function , however , folding into the native structure alone",
    "is not sufficient .",
    "coupled with the nucleotide and the mt , the two kinesin monomers in the dimeric complex need to alternate the acquisition of the native structure in a time - coordinated fashion for the uni - directional movement .",
    "the currently available three - dimensional structure ( pdb i d : 3kin , structure 2 in fig.2-a ) , in which each monomer is in its native state , does not provide such a dynamic picture by failing in fulfilling the geometrical requirement of simultaneous bindings of both motor domain to the adjacent tubulin binding sites that have an 8-nm gap .",
    "the inspection of 3-d structure suggests that a substantial increase of the distance between the two motor domains can be gained by breaking a few contacts associated with the neck - linker ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and the neck - linker binding site on the motor domain ( @xmath19 ) . to this end",
    ", we manipulated the 3-d structure of 3kin around the neck - linker of the l and created a temporary structure whose two heads bind to the mt binding sites simultaneously .",
    "both l and t have energetic biases towards the identical native fold but the interactions with the tubulin binding sites adapt the dimeric kinesin structure into a different minimum structure , which is not known _ a priori_. we performed simulations ( see methods ) to relax this initial structure and to establish the thermal equilibrium ensemble of the kinesin molecule on mt ( see fig.3-a ) .",
    "transient dimeric kinesin conformations corresponding to the steps ( iii ) and ( iv ) during the cycle ( fig.1 ) allow us to investigate the structural deviation between l and t of kinesin molecule .",
    "this simple computational exercise can confirm or dismiss the experimental conjecture regarding whether the mechanochemical strain significantly induces regulation on the nucleotide binding site and also if it occurs in the l. + * catalytic core of the leading head is less native - like on the mt : * since the nucleotide binding and release dynamics is sensitively controlled by the kinesin structure , we assume that the nucleotide molecule has an optimal binding affinity to the kinesin motor domain in the native structure . for function there is a need to understand how the native structure of the kinesin motor domain is perturbed under the different topological constraints imposed on the dimeric kinesin configuration by interacting with the mt .",
    "the equilibrium ensemble of the structures shows that the neck - linker is in the docked state for the t but undocked for l. in comparison to the native structure , the overall shape of the nucleotide binding pocket in the t is more preserved . as long as the mt constrains the two heads 8-nm apart , this configuration is dominant in the thermal ensemble ( see fig.3-a ) .",
    "_ global shape comparison : _ there are in principle multiple ways to quantitatively compare the two motor domain structures . to assess the structural differences ,",
    "the radius of gyration ( @xmath20 ) of the two motor domain structures from the equilibrium ensemble are computed ( see fig.3-b ) . because the neck - linker and the neck - helix adopt different configurations relative to the motor domain in each monomer",
    ", we perform a @xmath21 analysis for the motor domains only ( residue 2 - 324 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 distributions show that the l is slightly bigger than the t both in the size ( @xmath22  ) and in the dispersion ( @xmath23  ) .",
    "meanwhile the @xmath21 for the native state ( 3kin ) is @xmath24  .",
    "clearly , the sizes of both of the heads in the thermal ensemble are expanded at @xmath25 as compared to the native structure .",
    "the size alone does not tell much about the difference between the structures .",
    "the rmsd relative to the native structure and between the two motor domains ( residues 2 - 324 ) computed over the equilibrium ensemble gives @xmath26  , @xmath27  , @xmath28  , where @xmath29 is the rmsd between conformations x and y. if the @xmath30 helix is excluded from the rmsd calculation of motor domain ( residues 2 - 315 ) , then @xmath31  , @xmath32  , and @xmath33  .",
    "the rmsd analysis shows that the @xmath30 helix significantly contributes more for the deviation of the leading head from its native state than the t.    additional detailed comparisons with respect to the native state can be made using the structural overlap function of @xmath34 pair , @xmath35 , which is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 if @xmath38 , otherwise @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the distance of @xmath34 pair in native state , where @xmath41  . by setting @xmath42 values identical in both heads ( i.e.",
    ", both heads have the same native state ) , we compute the @xmath35 values for the trailing and the leading heads , respectively . the relative difference of the @xmath35 value between t and l , @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 which quantitatively measures the structural difference of the two heads . based on the @xmath43 value ( fig.3-c ) , the distances between the mt binding motif of the t ( l11 , l12 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and other secondary structure units ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) are 50 % more native - like than in the l.    _ conserved native contacts in trailing head reveals the strain propagation pathway in leading head : _ a direct measure of similarity to the native structure is the fraction of native contacts preserved in the thermal ensemble @xcite . since we assume that atp affinity is optimized in the native state , we can readily assess the quality of the structure using this measure .",
    "we quantify the nativeness of a pair using @xmath53 , where @xmath54 if @xmath55 , @xmath56 residues are in contact at the native state ( @xmath57  ) , and @xmath58 otherwise .",

    "when @xmath59 is averaged over all the native pairs , the average fraction of native contacts , @xmath62 is calculated as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total number of native pairs . for the t and l conformations , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the relative difference of native contacts between the two kinesin heads at the pair level , @xmath67 , is quantified similarly to eq.[eqn : chi ] as @xmath68 in fig.4 , @xmath67 is color - coded based on its value . as expected from the equilibrium ensemble , conspicuous differences are found around the structural motifs having direct contacts with neck - linker , giving @xmath69",
    ". quantitative inspection of the other contacts is illustrated in the structure .",
    "we color the kinesin head structure based on the @xmath67 value .",

    "the residue pairs are colored in light - blue if @xmath72 , blue if @xmath73 .",
    "more intact contacts , when the trailing and the leading head are compared , are visualized by yellow line in fig.5-b .",
    "our analysis not only shows that there is higher probability of the formation of native contacts present in the t in comparison to the l , but also suggests how the tension is propagated towards the nucleotide binding site to disrupt the nativeness of the nucleotide binding pocket in the leading head .",
    "as expected , a dense network of intact contacts are found between the neck - linker ( @xmath18 ) and the neck - linker binding motif ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this network continues along the @xmath52 helix , perturbing @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath45 , and finally reaches the nucleotide binding site ( see si fig.6 for the nomencaltures of the secondary structures ) .",
    "it is surprising that the disruptions of native contacts are found particularly in the nucleotide binding site , which is believed to be the trigger point for the allosteric transition .",
    "all the important nucleotide binding motifs ( p - loop , switch-1 , switch-2 , and n4 ) are recognized by our simulational analysis using a nonlinear - hamiltonian ( see supporting information for the comparison with linear - harmonic potential represented as gaussian network model ) . + * estimate of the tension in the neck - linker : * the deformation of the leading motor domain is caused by the internal tension in the neck linker .",
    "the tension on the neck linker is estimated using the force ( @xmath76 ) versus extension ( @xmath77 ) relationship of a worm - like chain model @xcite , @xmath78 ,   \\label{eqn : wlc}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the persistence length of the polymer and @xmath61 is the contour length . @xmath80 for the 15-amino acid neck - linker ( residue from 324 to 338 ) @xmath81 , and in the equilibrium ensemble of structures , @xmath82 @xmath4 . assuming that @xmath83 @xmath4 @xcite for this segment , we estimate a tension @xmath84 @xmath85 . by integrating eq.[eqn : wlc ] for @xmath86 @xmath4 . the tensional energy stored in the neck - linker",
    "is obtained , which is 17 @xmath87 .",
    "about 20% of the atp hydrolysis energy ( @xmath88 ) is stored in the neck - linker and directly perturbs the nucleotide binding site of the l , whereas mechanical action to the t is dissipated through the dense network of contacts formed between the neck - linker ( @xmath89 ) and the neck - linker binding site ( @xmath90 ) .    for a given extension @xmath91 ,",
    "when the length of the neck - linker is varied by @xmath92 , the variation in the length of the neck - linker can affect the effective tension as @xmath93(\\delta l / l)$ ] .",
    "for a given @xmath94 , the resulting tension change may be significant depending on the value of the extension @xmath77 .",
    "experimentally , the kinesin dynamics has recently been studied by varying the linker length by introducing a spacer composed of amino acids @xcite . since @xmath95 @xmath4 for the insertion of a single amino acid",
    ", the lengthening of the linker leads to a reduction of the tension by @xmath96 . in light of the force values",
    "controlling the kinesin dynamics in lot experiments , which is @xmath97 @xmath85 and 7 @xmath85 is the stall force , a value of @xmath98 can be significant . according to hackney _ et .",
    "_ s experimental analysis the processivity is reduced by @xmath99-fold when a single amino acid is inserted or deleted , and 6 or 12 additional amino acids resulted in to a 3@xmath1004 fold reduction in the kinetic processivity @xcite .",
    "because of the size and time scale spanned by a typical molecular motor as well as the lack of crystal structures , theoretical study based on the structure is not a common approach such as master equation descriptions @xcite or brownian ratchet models @xcite .",
    "knowledge of structural details , however , is the key ingredient to understand the mechanochemistry of molecular motors . in the present study",
    ", we propose computational strategies to resolve this problem in kinesin dynamics , particularly the nucleotide binding regulation mechanism between the two motor domains . by building a kinesin model on the tubulin filament",
    ", we explicitly identified the effect of internal tension ( @xmath84 @xmath85 ) on the front kinesin head domain and showed that the tension propagation to the leading head provokes the switch - related motifs ( p - loop , switch-1 , switch-2 ) in the nucleotide binding pocket .",
    "assuming `` the nativeness as a criterion for the optimal nucleotide binding condition '' , we concluded that the nucleotide binding pocket in the leading head is not favorable ( or partially unfolded or cracked @xcite ) for the nucleotide binding while the trailing head is bound to the mt .",
    "this conclusion explains the recent real - time single molecule traces of kinesin generated by guydosh and block @xcite .",
    "the reduction of ligand affinity of the leading head due to the rearward tension benefits the high processivity in two ways .",
    "first , the premature atp binding is inhibited before the chemical reaction ( atp hydrolysis , @xmath11 release ) in the trailing head is completed , during which the trailing head is tightly bound to the mt and the tension is built on the neck linker .",
    "second , the release of adp is facilitated in the leading head , which accelerates step @xmath101 in fig.1 .",
    "the latter point is consistent with uemura and ishiwata s experimental observation of a seven - fold increase of the adp dissociation constant from the monomeric kinesin head in the presence of rearward loading @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that global measures characterizing the two head domains do not distinguish the qualitative differences between the two heads .",
    "major changes in the strained region such as the kinesin neck - linker may be associated to minor global differences in the motor domain .",
    "exactly how these minor global differences that are localized in a small volume is amplified in the process of allosteric transition is the another key issue in understanding molecular motors .",
    "the internal tension regulates the interaction between the kinesin and the nucleotide .",
    "conversely , the interaction between kinesin , nucleotide , and mt also switches on and off the internal tension . for conventional kinesin , mechanical and chemical mechanism",
    "are closely correlated , producing a remarkable processivity of the kinesin movement on the mt .",
    "the simulations were performed using two classes of energy function .",
    "one is the standard structure based ( sb ) potential @xcite and the other is the self - organized polymer ( sop ) potential @xcite ( see supporting information and si figs .",
    "7 - 8 ) . for these two different topology - based potential functions",
    ", we obtained qualitatively identical results .",
    "results from the sb potential are presented in figs.3 - 5 while results from the sop potential are in si fig.9 in supporting materials .",

    "<S> in the presence of atp , kinesin proceeds along the protofilament of microtubule by alternated binding of two motor domains on the tubulin binding sites . </S>",
    "<S> since the processivity of kinesin is much higher than other motor proteins , it has been speculated that there exists a mechanism for allosteric regulation between the two monomers . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments suggest that atp binding to the leading head domain in kinesin is regulated by the rearward strain built on the neck - linker . </S>",
    "<S> we test this hypothesis by explicitly modeling a @xmath0-based kinesin structure whose both motor domains are bound on the tubulin binding sites . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium structures of kinesin on the microtubule show disordered and ordered neck - linker configurations for the leading and the trailing head , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the structures between the two heads shows that several native contacts present at the nucleotide binding site in the leading head are less intact than those in the binding site of the rear head . </S>",
    "<S> the network of native contacts obtained from this comparison provides the internal tension propagation pathway , which leads to the disruption of the nucleotide binding site in the leading head . </S>",
    "<S> also , using an argument based on polymer theory , we estimate the internal tension built on the neck - linker to be @xmath1 pn . both of these conclusions support the experimental hypothesis .        </S>",
