    "based on the sdss field images around the qso , as well as an examination of photometric redshifts of nearby bright galaxies , it is clear that 1050  is not in a rich cluster environment .",
    "however , the nearest bright galaxy to the qso does have a comparable photometric redshift , and has colors and a derived absolute magnitude ( m@xmath42 ) consistent with a massive early - type system . since luminous red galaxies are generally found in relatively clustered environments @xcite ,",

    "similarly , the composite type ii quasar spectrum of @xcite gives a value i(@xmath66)/i(@xmath67 , whereas we find an upper limit of 0.16 for this ratio in the narrow line spectrum of 1050 .",
    "these results suggest that depletion of fe and mg into grains in the nlr of 1050  may be more severe than in most agn .    on the other hand , there are reasons for caution .",

    "( 2 ) @xcite estimated a probability of only @xmath68 for a line - of - sight kick velocity of @xmath69 as observed for .",
    "for 1050 , the shift of @xmath1 is closer to the theoretical maximum of @xmath70 , resulting in an even lower probability .",
    "note , however , that this argument is sensitive to the exact value of the maximum recoil velocity , currently based on extrapolation @xcite .",
    "also note that @xcite argue that an ejection velocity of this magnitude is more likely to result from a three - body interaction than a gravitational radiation recoil event .",
    "( 3 ) the  doublet is marginally resolved with a typical line ratio of i@xmath71/i@xmath72 , implying an electron density @xmath73 from the `` nebular '' software @xcite .",

    "the result is a distance of @xmath74  kpc for the ionizing source from the narrow emission - line gas .",
    "this indicates an age of @xmath75 , contributing to the low probability of catching a recoil in this stage .",
    "( 4 ) the narrow line spectrum of 1050  is in most regards quite normal and conforms to the pattern of strong  with weak fe  ii . the question of whether the ionizing continuum from a displaced qso would produce normal agn narrow - line ratios in the host galaxy ism requires investigation @xcite .",
    "double peaked broad balmer lines are sometimes seen , and a number of cases have been interpreted in terms of line emission from a keplerian disk .",
    "occasionally , the broad balmer lines may have a single peak shifted relative to the narrow lines .",
    "often in such cases , the profile is asymmetric , with the red wing more extended in the case of a blue - shifted peak , and vice versa , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this pattern is evident in the   and  profiles of 1050 ( figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "in addition , the  centroid is @xmath20 blueshifted , smaller than for .",
    "@xcite noted a pattern for  to have a smaller shift than  among their displaced - peak agn .",
    "the 3500  blueshift of the balmer line peak of 1050  is large but not unprecedented for a double - peaked emitter . in table 3 of @xcite , among 138 double - peaked emitters , the shift of the blue peak @xmath76 ranges from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , with 21 objects blueshifted @xmath1 or more .",
    "however , the combination of the large shift and the dominance and symmetry of the blue peak of 1050  is exceptional . in strateva et al .",
    ", fwhm for  ranges from 3700 to @xmath79 ; and the centroid at half - maximum , fwhm@xmath80 , ranges from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , with only 5 objects having fwhm@xmath80 more negative than @xmath83 .",
    "the combination of low fwhm of @xmath20 and large fwhm@xmath80 of @xmath84 for 1050   stands apart among known double - peaked emitters .",
    "the reason for this is the weakness of the red wing and absence of a significant red peak , so that the width and centroid at half - maximum are determined by the blue peak alone .",
    "several studies have noted a tendency for the low ionization forbidden lines to be strong in double - peaked agn .",
    "1050 departs from this pattern .",
    "@xcite , working with radio loud objects , found that the ratio i([o",
    "iii]@xmath47 ) has a median value of 0.14 for their  disk - like emitters \" but only 0.05 for other broad - line radio galaxies",
    "( blrgs ) . from table 1 , we measure this ratio to be @xmath86 , less than half the lowest value among the disklike emitters in table 10 of @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of 1050  bears a strong resemblance to that of sdss , originally suggested as a parsec scale binary black hole by @xcite .",
    "has a broad  line peak blueshifted by @xmath1 , similar to the case of 1050 .",
    "observations of  by @xcite and @xcite make a strong case for a double - peaked emitter .",
    "most significantly , the  broad line , out of range of the sdss spectrum considered by @xcite , shows a red peak at a similar velocity offset to the stronger blue peak .",
    "this example reinforces the case for caution in making exotic interpretations of 1050  and other objects with displaced broad line peaks .",
    "the red  blue asymmetry in 1050 is more extreme than for . at a velocity of @xmath87 from the narrow line redshift ( symmetrical with the blue peak )",
    ", the sdss spectrum of 1050  shows a low red wing with little indication of a secondary peak or shoulder .",
    "the height of the red wing above the continuum at this velocity is @xmath88 times the height of the blue peak .",
    "the corresponding red / blue ratio in  is @xmath89 .",
    "a further parallel between 1050  and  is the presence of narrow   absorption in both . in ,",
    "the   absorption is at -240  with respect to systemic velocity of the host galaxy , and in 1050  it is at -500  .",
    "@xcite argue that the geometry giving rise to the  absorption may be difficult to explain in a model involving ejection of the black hole from the nucleus . for 1050",
    ", we have estimated that the recoiling black hole is about 2  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "it seems possible that material ejected from the nucleus at an earlier stage of the agn , left over from a recent galactic merger , or associated with a companion galaxy , might cause the  absorption .",
    "an alternative model of , proposed by @xcite , is a double - peaked emitter in a sub - parsec binary supermassive black hole system . in their picture",
    ", there is a normal , fairly symmetrical double peaked profile from a keplerian disk around the more massive hole , and the blue shifted peak comes from another blr associated with the secondary black hole . if such a model were applied to 1050 , the double - peaked disk emission would be considerably weaker relative to the blueshifted blr emission from the secondary and would lack a well - defined peak on the red side of the line profile .    could recoil ( or three - body ejection ) result in asymmetrical broad emission lines that mimic a double peaked emitter ?",
    "the orbital period for the blr is roughly @xmath90  yr , so there should be ample time for a normal , symmetrical blr to be re - established in the @xmath91  yr time since since the recoil event , as estimated above .",
    "this is the basis for rejection of asymmetrical broad line objects by @xcite .",
    "however , a better understanding of the dynamics of the retained accretion disk and blr in a kicked agn is needed , including the longevity of asymmetries from the initial transient and the effect of a different outer boundary condition for a wandering agn disk .",
    "1050  shows an unusual combination of a large velocity shift of the broad lines and a fairly symmetrical profile , especially for .",
    "this object is in some respects an interesting candidate for black hole recoil , in particular its highly blueshifted yet symmetrical broad  line and certain aspects of its narrow emission line spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a weak but visible red wing on , and the lesser blueshift of the  line , suggest that this object is most likely an extreme member of the class of double - peaked emitters .",
    "observations of the rest far - uv spectrum are needed to establish the velocity and profile of the high ionization broad lines , such as , which tend to be narrower and less shifted than the balmer lines in double - peaked emitters @xcite .",
    "improved observations of the  line profile are needed for a definitive measurement of the peak velocity and profile , as well as the strength of narrow .",
    "high resolution imaging can test for displacement of the agn from the galactic nucleus and for tidal features indicative of a recent merger , as might be expected if the object is a recoil event or binary .",
    "multi - epoch spectroscopic monitoring can tighten constraints on the binary model and test for broad - line variability , as often occurs for double - peaked emitters .",
    "if 1050  is confirmed as a double - peaked emitter , its extreme properties may lead to a better understanding of this class of agn and help to develop criteria for distinguishing true cases of recoil or binary supermassive black holes .",
