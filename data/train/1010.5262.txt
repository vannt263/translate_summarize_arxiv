    "the narrow fe  k@xmath0 emission line in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is by now an established feature of the x - ray spectrum of both type  1 and type  2 sources ( e.g. see shu , yaqoob , & wang 2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "the fwhm of the emission line is usually found to be less than @xmath7 or so , indicating an origin in the outer ( optical ) broad line region ( blr ) or further out , in the putative parsec - scale torus ( e.g. yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ; bianchi et al .",

    "( 2010 ) in fact found that the width of the fe  k@xmath0 line relative to the optical line width of h@xmath8 varies from source to source so that there may not be a `` universal '' location for the x - ray reprocessor .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy also shows overwhelming evidence for the fe  k@xmath0 line peaking at @xmath9  kev , indicating that the matter responsible for producing this line is essentially neutral ( e.g. sulentic et al .",

    "although emission lines from ionized species of fe are observed in some agn ( e.g. yaqoob et al . 2003 ; bianchi et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ) , the present paper is concerned specifically with the fe  k@xmath0 line component that is centered around 6.4  kev . although some type  2 agn do not show evidence for line - of - sight x - ray obscuration ( brightman & nandra 2008 ) , in general the `` type classification '' of agn appears to be related to the orientation of the structure of circumnuclear matter in the central engine .",
    "this , along with the fact that the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line at @xmath9  kev appears in the x - ray spectra of agn regardless of whether or not the x - ray spectrum shows line - of - sight obscuration suggests that the material producing the fe  k@xmath0 emission line is in some sense toroidal .",
    "the modification of the intrinsic x - ray spectrum due to the effects of absorption , scattering and fluorescence in the circumnuclear matter are not trivial to calculate in the compton - thick regime since the reprocessing is a complicated function of column density , geometry ( and covering factor ) , element abundances , and the system inclination angle ( e.g. ghisellini , haardt , & matt 1994 ; ikeda , awaki , & terashima 2009 ) .",
    "to obtain the most accurate spectra , monte carlo simulations are required . in murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 , hereafter my09 ) and yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we presented the results of monte carlo calculations for the reprocessed x - ray continuum and the fe  k@xmath0 emission line in a toroidal geometry , valid for column densities in the range @xmath10 to @xmath2 , thus covering the compton - thin to compton - thick regimes . only the results for the zeroth - order , or core , component for the fe  k@xmath0 emission line in the my09 model",
    "have been presented thus far ( the zeroth - order component corresponds to line photons that escape the medium without scattering ) .",
    "the scattered emission - line photons constitute the so - called `` compton shoulder '' , which can provide additional critical information on the column density and orientation of the line emitter ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1994 ; sunyaev & churazov 1996 ; matt 2002 ; watanabe et al .",
    "2003 ) . given the high degree of degeneracy in modeling complex x - ray spectra , including a physical model of the compton shoulder ( as opposed to a simple ad hoc component ) is important , especially in view of the fact that even the non - detection of a compton shoulder provides constraints on the physical parameters of the model . quantifying upper limits on the compton shoulder when it is not detected particularly demands a physically - motivated model .",
    "we have substantially improved the statistical accuracy of the x - ray spectra of the toroidal reprocessor model ( mytorus ) described in my09 in order for it to be suitable for spectral - fitting to real data .",
    "the monte carlo results have been put into formats that are readily useable in conjunction with standard x - ray spectral - fitting packages and we have made the mytorus model publicly available . in the present paper we describe the detailed form of the compton shoulder of the fe  k@xmath0 line in a toroidal geometry and discuss its dependence on the model parameters .",
    "we note that the mytorus model is not restricted to any absolute size scale so it can be applied to _ any _ toroidal distribution of matter that is centrally - illuminated by x - rays .",
    "gaskell , goosmann , & klimek ( 2008 ) argue that there is considerable observational evidence that the blr itself has a toroidal structure , and that there may be no distinct boundary between the blr and the classical parsec - scale torus .",
    "gaskell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also argue that there may even be no distinction between the outer accretion disk and the blr .",
    "a toroidal distribution of matter may exist anywhere from the outer accretion disk to parsec - scale distances from the x - ray continuum source .",
    "thus , throughout the present paper , we shall refer to _ any _ toroidal distribution of matter in the central engine as `` the torus '' , regardless of it s actual size or physical location in the agn central engine .",
    "our torus model complements hydrodynamical , photoionized _ torus wind _",
    "simulations such as those of dorodnitsyn & kallman ( 2009 ) which are designed to account for the emission lines from ionized species in agn , and the photoionized absorber and emission lines from ionized in some type  1 agn .",
    "such models of evaporation of the inner torus do not account for the fe  k@xmath0 line component that is centered around @xmath9  kev , which must originate in the cooler , unionized region of the torus .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ mytorusmodel ]",
    "we give a brief overview of the assumptions of the mytorus model and in  [ linecsdef ] we clarify the definition of the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder in the present paper . in  [ fllcsratio ]",
    "we present the results for the ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder flux to the zeroth - order flux , and in  [ fllcspardepend ] we discuss the characteristic shapes of the compton shoulder profile as a function of some of the model parameters . in  [ csgamdepend ]",
    "we illustrate the dependence of the shape of the compton shoulder profile on the form of the intrinsic , incident x - ray continuum , and in  [ fllvelbroad ] we discuss the effects of velocity broadening on the fe  k@xmath0 line core and compton shoulder .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ summary ] .",
    "here we give a brief overview of the critical assumptions that the model monte carlo simulations are based upon .",
    "full details can be found in my09 .",
    "our geometry is an azimuthally - symmetric doughnut - like torus with a circular cross - section , characterized by only two parameters , namely the half - opening angle , @xmath11 , and the equatorial column density , @xmath12 ( see fig .  1 in my09 ) .",
    "we assume that the x - ray source is located at the center of the torus and emits isotropically and that the reprocessing material is uniform and essentially neutral ( cold ) . for illumination by an x - ray source that is emitting isotropically , the mean column density , integrated over all incident angles of rays through the torus ,",
    "is @xmath13  @xmath14@xmath12 .",
    "the inclination angle between the observer s line of sight and the symmetry axis of the torus is denoted by @xmath15 , where @xmath15 @xmath16 corresponds to a face - on observing angle and @xmath15 @xmath17 corresponds to an edge - on observing angle . in our calculations",
    "we distribute the emergent photons in 10 angle bins between @xmath18 and @xmath19 that have equal widths in @xmath20 , and refer to the face - on bin as # 1 , and the edge - on bin as # 10 ( see table  1 in my09 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath11 for which we have calculated a comprehensive set of models is @xmath3 , for @xmath21 in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 , valid for input spectra with energies in the range 0.5500  kev ( see my09 for details ) . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the solid angle subtended by the torus at the x - ray source , @xmath23 , is @xmath24 ( and we refer to @xmath25 $ ] as a covering factor , which in this case is 0.5 ) .",
    "the covering factor may also be expressed in terms of the physical dimensions of the torus .",
    "if @xmath26 is the radius of the circular cross - section of the torus , and @xmath27 is the equatorial ( i.e. maximum ) radius of the torus then @xmath25=(a / c)$ ] ( see my09 ) .",
    "our model employs a full relativistic treatment of compton scattering , using the full differential and total klein - nishina compton - scattering cross - sections .",
    "we utilized photoelectric absorption cross - sections for 30 elements as described in verner & yakovlev ( 1995 ) and verner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and we used anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) elemental cosmic abundances in our calculations .",
    "the thomson depth may also be expressed in terms of the column density : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the column density in units of @xmath30 . here",
    ", we have employed the mean number of electrons per h atom , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mean molecular weight . with the abundances of anders & grevesse , @xmath33 , assuming that the number of electrons from all other elements aside from h and he is negligible . for the fe  k@xmath0 and fe  k@xmath8 fluorescent emission lines , we used rest - frame line energies of 6.4008  kev and 7.058  kev respectively , appropriate for neutral matter ( e.g. see palmeri et al .",
    "we used a fluorescence yield for fe of 0.347 ( see bambynek et al .",
    "1972 ) and an fe  k@xmath8 to fe  k@xmath0 branching ratio of 0.135 ( representative of the range of experimental and theoretical values discussed in palmeri et al .",
    "2003 , see also kallman et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "compared to my09 , the results in the present paper have a substantially higher statistical accuracy because they are based on monte carlo simulations with higher numbers of injected rays at each energy , and the calculations employ the method of weights ( as opposed to following individual photons ) .",
    "the statistical accuracy actually achieved depends on the model parameters .",
    "the most challenging regime corresponds to the highest column density torus ( @xmath2 ) observed edge - on , and in this worst - case scenario the statistical errors on the compton shoulder profile ( for the default torus opening angle and abundances ) are better than @xmath34 per 100  ev energy bin . on the other hand , for a face - on torus with a column density of @xmath35 , the corresponding statistical errors on the compton shoulder profile are better than @xmath36 per 100  ev bin .    throughout the present paper we present results for power - law incident continua ( in the range 0.5500  kev ) , characterized by a photon index , @xmath37 , by integrating the basic monoenergetic monte carlo results",
    "( greens functions see my09 ) .",
    "the zeroth - order component of the fe  k@xmath0 fluorescent emission line refers to line photons that escape without any interaction with the medium that they were created in .",
    "although they are emitted by atoms / ions isotropically , the angular distribution of the emerging zeroth - order line photons in general depends on the geometry , unless the medium is optically - thin to the line photons .",
    "the zeroth - order line photons constitute the majority of photons in the emergent emission line for the parameters pertaining to our model assumptions , and they all have the same energy in the monte carlo results because they have not interacted with the medium .",
    "when velocity broadening is applied to the zeroth - order line emission the photon energies are of course modified to reflect the distribution of the broadening function .",
    "most of the fluorescent fe  k@xmath0 emission - line measurements in the literature that have been modeled with simple gaussian functions correspond to the zeroth - order of the emission line .",
    "however , depending on the spectral resolution of the instrument , some of the measured flux of this line core may include a contribution from the compton - scattered line photons ( or compton shoulder ) since the scattered line component consists of photons with a range of energies going all the way up to the zeroth - order line energy .",
    "if one compares the results of applying the mytorus model to results in the literature that were obtained using ad hoc models for the fe  k@xmath0 line core and compton shoulder one must scrutinize precisely which components of the line were actually measured with the ad hoc model components .",
    "we refer to fluorescent emission - line photons that escape the medium after at least one interaction as the scattered component of the line .",
    "compton scattering shapes the energy distribution of the scattered line photons .",
    "however , the final scattered line profile depends on the geometry , orientation , and column density distribution of the medium because the escape probabilities after scattering may be highly directional . in cold matter",
    ", the scattered photon distribution resulting from the @xmath38 scattering has a spread in energy from @xmath39 ( the rest - frame zeroth - order line energy ) , down to @xmath40 $ ]  kev .",
    "the number of photons in each scattering order is diminished compared to the number in the previous scattering order .",
    "the exact dependence of the relative number of photons in each scattering , and therefore of the measurable width of the scattered distribution , is a function of model parameters .",
    "if the optical depth to absorption of the line photons is much greater or much less than unity , only the first scattering may dominate . even for intermediate optical depths",
    "the third scattering is , for practical purposes , negligible in flux compared to the first scattering .",
    "the term `` compton shoulder '' has been used in the literature in more than one way .",
    "the most common usage refers to the line flux between the energy extrema of the first scattering , _ which includes some contributions from all scatterings_. this is because the contributions from all scattering orders extends to the zeroth - order line energy and different scattering orders can not be measured separately .",
    "this is referred to as `` cs1 '' ( e.g. see matt 2002 ) , and is illustrated in fig .  1",
    ". some literature may refer to only the first scattering as the compton shoulder , but this of course can only have a theoretical context . a third definition , which is the one we use here and throughout the present paper , is that the compton shoulder includes _ all _ of the scattered line flux , for all scatterings ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is the most appropriate definition for a model such as mytorus which self - consistently calculates the zeroth - order and the entire scattered line profile and does not allow the relative fluxes of the two components to vary in an ad hoc fashion .",
    "definitions such as cs1 are not necessary for our purpose because there is no need to fit the scattered component of an emission line separately .",
    "in practice it may not actually be possible to observationally distinguish the zeroth - order component of an emission line from its compton shoulder .",
    "the finite energy resolution of the instrument and/or the velocity broadening ( of all the emission - line components ) may confuse the two blended components of a line .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 with dotted lines placed at energies corresponding to @xmath41 either side of the zeroth - order line energy .",
    "having said that , one will never need to observationally distinguish between the zeroth - order component of an emission line from its compton shoulder with the mytorus model because it is a self - consistent model .",
    "however , it is important to be aware of the `` mixing '' for the interpretation of spectral - fitting results , and more will be said on this topic when we discuss velocity broadening in  [ fllvelbroad ] .",
    "the relative magnitude of the zeroth - order and scattered line components is fixed by the physics and geometry and in fig .",
    "2 we show the ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder flux to the zeroth - order line flux ( hereafter , the cs ratio ) as a function of @xmath21 for two different values of @xmath15 ( corresponding to the face - on and edge - on inclination angle bins see table  1 in my09 ) . the calculations in fig .",
    "2 were made for an incident power - law continuum with a photon index of 1.9 .",
    "it can seen that the ratio peaks at @xmath42 , reaching a maximum of @xmath43 ( face - on ) , and @xmath44 ( edge - on ) .",
    "for the face - on case , the cs ratio remains at @xmath43 for higher column densities since the compton shoulder photons escape from within a compton - depth or so from the illuminated surfaces of the torus for lines - of - sight that are not obscured .",
    "for the edge - on case the cs ratio declines as function of column density after reaching its maximum value , due to a higher probability of absorption at higher column densities . in the optically - thin limit , one might expect the cs ratio to be approximately @xmath45 , and this relation is shown in fig .  2 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the actual cs ratios fall below this line because the fe  k@xmath0 line photons are formed throughout the medium , so that the average column density for scattering of the line photons is less than @xmath46 . at @xmath47 ,",
    "the cs ratio is a factor @xmath48 , and @xmath49 less than @xmath50 for the face - on and edge - on orientation respectively .",
    "the face - on orientation obviously has a smaller mean column density than the edge - on one .",
    "matt ( 2002 ) showed the cs ratio for spherical and disk geometries ( albeit for the `` cs1 '' definition of the compton shoulder ) .",
    "the spherical geometry shows a maximum cs ratio of @xmath51 for @xmath52 , similar to the case for the edge - on torus ( and note that the spherical radial column densities should be compared with @xmath53 times our equatorial torus column densities ) .",
    "the compton - thick disk geometry shows a lower cs ratio , peaking at @xmath54 ( matt 2002 ) , less than the corresponding value for the compton - thick face - on torus .",
    "the range of incident and emergent photon angles are very different for the two geometries and the differences in the reflection spectra from the torus and disk geometries have been discussed in my09 .",
    "we found that for all values of @xmath15 for the torus , there was no detectable difference in the cs ratio as a function of @xmath37 up to the @xmath12 value that gives the maximum cs ratio ( for a given value of @xmath15 ) .",
    "after that , the cs ratios diverge for different values of @xmath37 , with flatter incident continua giving larger cs ratios . for the face - on case , the cs ratio at @xmath55 varies between @xmath56 to @xmath57 as @xmath37 varies from 2.5 to 1.5 . for the edge - on case ,",
    "the cs ratio at @xmath55 varies between @xmath58 to @xmath59 as @xmath37 varies from 2.5 to 1.5 .",
    "flatter spectra have relatively more continuum photons at higher energies so that the fe  k@xmath0 line photons are produced deeper in the medium , increasing the average thomson depth for zeroth - order line photons to scatter before escaping .",
    "although these variations in the cs ratio with @xmath37 are small , the effect of different values of @xmath37 on the compton shoulder _ shape _ is much more pronounced ( see  [ csgamdepend ] ) .",
    "the shape of the compton shoulder of a fluorescent emission - line escaping from the torus has a dependence on the column density and inclination angle of the torus .",
    "it is also affected by the shape of the incident continuum spectrum , the covering factor ( or opening angle ) , and element abundances . in this section",
    "we discuss the shape of the fe  k@xmath0 line shoulder for the default covering factor ( @xmath60=0.5 $ ] ) and solar abundances . fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 illustrate the shapes of the compton shoulder for a power - law incident continuum with @xmath61 , for four column densities ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) and different inclination angles of the torus .",
    "fig .  3 and fig .  4",
    "show compton shoulders for the same physical parameters except that in the former the profiles are plotted against compton wavelength shift and in the latter they are plotted against absolute energy .",
    "the compton shoulders in fig .  3 are in units of the _ dimensionless _ compton wavelength shift with respect to the zeroth - order rest - frame energy of the emission line . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath66 is the energy of a line photon , and @xmath39 is the zeroth - order line energy , @xmath67 .",
    "the compton shoulder shapes shown in both fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 are from the original monte carlo results and have no velocity broadening applied to them . in order to facilitate a direct comparison of the compton shoulder profile shapes for different column densities and inclination angles , all of the profiles in fig .",
    "3 have been normalized to a flux of unity .",
    "it should be remembered that the absolute flux of the compton shoulder varies significantly with column density , and the flux ratio for two column densities can be estimated using fig .  2 .",
    "the compton shoulder profiles that are plotted against energy ( fig .",
    "4 ) _ do _ show _ relative _ fluxes for different parameters that reflect the original monte carlo results .",
    "interpretation of fig .",
    "3 is aided by the relation between @xmath68 and the scattering angle , @xmath0 : @xmath69 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "3 that at a column density of @xmath70 the compton shoulder is dominated by the first scattering and the profile is determined by the appropriate sampling of the single - scattering thomson differential cross - section ( which is peaked for forward and backward scattering and has a minimum for orthogonal scattering angles ) . for the face - on compton shoulder at such low column densities ,",
    "the forward and backward scattering peaks are suppressed , giving an essentially flat compton shoulder profile .",
    "this is because most of the scattering occurs in the equatorial plane of the torus when the scattering optical depth is small because the equatorial plane presents the largest column density .",
    "thus , zeroth - order line photons with directions that roughly align with the equatorial plane must scatter predominantly at right angles in order to be observed in the face - on torus @xmath15 bin . on the other hand ,",
    "those zeroth - order line photons that undergo forward and backward scattering are likely to be traveling in directions aligned with the equatorial plane again after scattering so are not as likely to appear in the face - on torus @xmath15 bin . for larger inclination angles ,",
    "we see in fig .  3 that the forward and backward scattering peaks become more and more prominent , and for the edge - on angle bin they are significantly enhanced and the @xmath19 scattering direction is correspondingly suppressed .",
    "we obtained similar compton shoulder profiles for column densities less than @xmath70 .",
    "as the column density of the torus increases , a scattered line photon is more likely to escape the medium if it scatters near a surface . near the non - illuminated surfaces of the torus ( i.e. the surfaces with more material in between the x - ray source and the first scattering ) , there are less zeroth - order fe  k@xmath0 line photons produced .",
    "the zeroth - order line photons that do appear near the far - side surfaces were more likely produced near an illuminated surface and are therefore predominantly heading _ towards _ the far surface rather than away from it .",
    "however , even if a zeroth - order line photon is traveling towards the surface ( no matter how far from the x - ray source ) , if it is back - scattered , the scattered photon then travels back in to the medium , with a higher mean free path to escape .",
    "therefore , the scattered photons that are produced by zeroth - order line photons traveling towards the surface _ and _ undergo forward scattering will preferentially escape the medium .",
    "we can see this in fig .  3 for @xmath71 , which shows enhancement of the forward - scattering peak and suppression of the back - scattering peak .",
    "the effect is more and more pronounced as the inclination angle becomes larger and larger because back - scattered photons could be intercepted by the other side of the torus , presenting a large mean free path to escape compared to photons back - scattering near the surface in directions perpendicular to the equatorial plane . also",
    ", the parts of the torus that scatter line photons into non - intercepting lines of sight present a mean column density to the x - ray continuum that is smaller than the equatorial parts of the torus",
    ". thus , the edge - on compton shoulder profiles for @xmath71 are significantly asymmetric , weighted in favor of forward - scattering .    as the column density of the torus increases even further ,",
    "the zeroth - order fe  k@xmath0 line photons are created closer and closer to the surfaces nearest the continuum illumination since the continuum flux that produces the fluorescence diminishes further into the medium .",
    "therefore scattered photons preferentially escape from the illuminated surfaces .",
    "thus , the probability of scattered photons escaping from the medium is not very different for forward - scattering and back - scattering because now there is no selection effect for the original zeroth - order line photon to be heading towards a surface before scattering . at lower column densities",
    ", zeroth - order photons could end up a longer way into the medium , far from an illuminated surface , where it was less unlikely to find a zeroth - order photon traveling _ away _ from the surface ( in which case it would have to back - scatter to escape ) .",
    "however , now for a higher column density , there is a dearth of zeroth - order line photons near surfaces that are not directly illuminated by the continuum because large numbers are absorbed or scattered before they get there , and the continuum is heavily extinguished , producing less zeroth - order photons near far - side surfaces .",
    "it can be seen from fig .  3 that for @xmath72 , the forward - scattering peak is now indeed not particularly strong compared to the back - scattering peak and the compton shoulder profiles have now become more symmetric again for the intercepting lines of sight .",
    "some of this symmetry is caused by the higher - order scatterings effectively raising the back - scattering peak .",
    "the compton shoulder profiles for the non - intercepting lines - of - sight are not very different to those for @xmath71 ( i.e they still have a slightly higher weighting on the forward - scattering peak ) .",
    "this is because for these scattered photons no material is being added between the observer and the scattering sites as the column density increases , and adding more optical depth deeper in the medium does not make much difference because the deeper scattering sites can not make a further significant contribution to the observed scattered flux .",
    "now , moving on to the highest column density compton shoulder profiles in fig .  3 ( @xmath65 ) we see that those for the non - intercepting lines - of - sight are essentially similar to those for a column density of @xmath73 .",
    "this is not surprising because the medium was already compton thick at that column density and the compton shoulder photons were already dominated by scattering near the illuminated surfaces , with clear lines - of - sight to the observer .",
    "however , the situation is different as we go to an edge - on orientation of the torus .",
    "here we see that it is the _ back - scattering _ peak that now dominates over the forward - scattering peak .",
    "the reason for this is that most of the torus is so compton - thick that all of the compton shoulder photons now come from two `` rings '' on opposite surfaces of the torus , such that the rings are regions having the smallest column density in directions parallel to the equatorial plane . for zeroth - order line photons that are created and scattered in this band of emission ,",
    "there is no preference for forward and backward - scattering .",
    "however , it is possible that zeroth - order line photons that escaped from the inner surface of the torus closer to the equatorial plane , can scatter in the `` ring '' and be observed in the compton shoulder profile .",
    "for the smaller column density of @xmath73 these photons could forward - scatter or backward - scatter in the `` ring '' and still reach the observer .",
    "however , at a column density of @xmath65 the opacity is so high for the forward - scattering route that it is suppressed .",
    "the backward - scattering route on the other hand , does not have to intercept the other side of the torus again before escape , unless the line - of - sight is _ exactly _ edge - on . recall that our edge - on angle bin is actually a wedge that is a few degrees wide ( see table  1 in my09 ) .",
    "thus , for an exactly edge - on orientation , the back - scattering peak would again be suppressed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the torus is actually patchy ( for example , consisting of a distribution of clouds ) , the back - scattering peak would be observed even for exactly edge - on orientations .    the profile in fig .  3 ( and in fig .",
    "4 ) for the edge - on case for @xmath74 is a _ new _ , type of compton shoulder that has not been predicted before .",
    "it does not appear in spherical or disk geometries ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ; sunyaev & churazov 1996 ; matt 2002 ) , and to reveal it in a toroidal geometry requires very high signal - to - noise monte carlo simulations , otherwise it is not discernible from the noise . in energy space , this type of compton shoulder would show up in the x - ray spectrum as a peak at @xmath4  kev , separated from the zeroth - order fe  k@xmath0 line core at @xmath9  kev if the velocity width is small enough .",
    "if such a compton shoulder were observed , it would be a powerful indicator of a toroidal structure ( possibly made of discrete clumps ) with a column density of the order of @xmath65 , observed edge - on .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "a centrally - illuminated , uniform spherical geometry does not have any non - intercepting lines of sight so it can only produce compton shoulder profiles in the compton - thick regime that are weighted towards forward scattering . moreover , an externally illuminated compton - thick disk _ only _ has non - intercepting lines of sight and can therefore only produce essentially symmetric compton shoulder profiles , with no preference for forward or backward scattering .",
    "in  [ fllcsratio ] we reported a weak dependence of the ratio of the flux in the compton shoulder to the zeroth - order fe  k@xmath0 line flux on the photon index , @xmath37 , of the power - law incident continuum . here",
    "we report the dependence of the _ shape _ of the compton shoulder profile on @xmath37 .",
    "5 shows the compton shoulder profiles for @xmath55 , directly comparing the cases of @xmath75 ( dotted curves ) and @xmath76 ( solid curves ) for face - on ( _ left panel _ ) and edge - on ( _ right panel _ ) orientations . as in fig .  3 ( and as described in  [ fllcspardepend ] )",
    ", the fluxes have been renormalized so that the total flux is unity and the compton shoulder profiles are plotted against @xmath77 .",
    "it can be seen that for the face - on orientation the dependence of the shape of the compton shoulder profile on the steepness of the incident x - ray continuum is extremely weak and would not in practice be detectable . however , the situation is different for the edge - on orientation .",
    "the compton shoulder profile is more symmetric for the flatter incident spectrum ( @xmath75 ) , whilst the steeper spectrum ( @xmath76 ) still shows the back - scattering peak . as discussed at the end of  [ fllcspardepend ] , for column densities as high as @xmath2 , two `` rings '' of emission on the surfaces of the torus that are parallel to the equatorial plane contribute flux to the compton shoulder profile that has no forward or backward scattering preference . for flatter incident continua , the fe  k@xmath0 line photons",
    "are formed deeper in the medium because there are a relatively higher number of high - energy continuum photons ( than in steeper spectra ) , which can penetrate deeper into the medium than lower energy photons .",
    "the higher energy continuum photons also undergo a larger number of mean scatterings than lower energy before being absorbed by an fe k edge so that the resulting fe  k@xmath0 photons originate from a larger region . for these reasons",
    "fe  k@xmath0 photons that result from the absorption of high - energy continuum photons are more likely to scatter locally before escape , but the fe  k@xmath0 photons created by lower - energy continuum photons are more likely to encounter their first scattering on the far side of the torus .",
    "therefore the compton - shoulder has a relatively greater symmetric component for @xmath75 than for @xmath76 .",
    "so far we have discussed the compton shoulder profiles calculated directly from the monte carlo simulations , which do not include any kinematics . in practice",
    ", doppler shifts due to bulk motion will broaden the compton shoulders and such velocity broadening should be included when fitting real data with a model of the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "we also wish to study the possible confusion in velocity width measurements resulting from the doublet - splitting of the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "this is going to be especially important for observations of agn made with calorimeters ( as planned for _ astro - h _ ) which will have a spectral resolution for the fe  k@xmath0 line of several ev ( for `` local '' , low - redshift agn ) .",
    "for neutral fe , the k@xmath0 emission consists of two lines , k@xmath78 at 6.404 kev and k@xmath79 at 6.391 kev , with a branching ratio of 2:1 ( e.g. see bambynek et al .",
    "1972 ) . in the monte",
    "carlo simulations these were treated as a single line with an energy of 6.4008  kev ( corresponding to the weighted mean energies of the fe  k@xmath78 and fe  k@xmath79 lines ) . for the mytorus spectral - fitting model ,",
    "the two components of the fe  k@xmath0 line are _ reconstructed _ using the above branching ratio and line energies .",
    "the energy difference between the two components is small enough to neglect the differences in opacities and the error incurred in this procedure is too small to impact fitting even _",
    "astro - h _ data . for each of the fe line components , k@xmath78 and fe  k@xmath79",
    ", we can construct a compton shoulder for a given set of torus parameters , and sum the two profiles with the correct branching ratio .",
    "we then apply simple velocity broadening by convolving the summed profile with a gaussian .",
    "the actual velocity - broadening function is _ unlikely _ to be a gaussian , but it is also unlikely that even _",
    "astro - h _ will be able to distinguish between different geometries of the distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line in agn just from its velocity profile ( e.g. see yaqoob et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the effect of velocity broadening on the fe  k@xmath0 fluorescent line spectrum is illustrated in fig .  6 for @xmath80 and the edge - on orientation ( angle bin # 10 ) .",
    "this time _",
    "we include the zeroth - order _ components of the emission lines , as well as the compton shoulders , and we plot the spectra as a function of energy ( and not @xmath77 ) .",
    "we also show the fe  k@xmath8 emission line which is also produced by our monte carlo simulations ( see my09 for details ) . a simple gaussian function has been employed for convolving the emission - line profiles , using a fwhm velocity that is constant with respect to energy .",
    "a total of four components are thus convolved ( the zeroth - order components of fe  k@xmath78 and fe  k@xmath79 , and their respective compton shoulders ) .",
    "spectra are shown for four values of the fwhm , namely @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the value of @xmath81 is approximately the velocity resolution that will be achieved in the fe  k band by the calorimeters aboard _",
    "astro - h_.",
    "the value of @xmath82 is in the regime expected for the classical , parsec - scale torus .",
    "the value of @xmath83 is approximately the velocity resolution of the _ chandra _ high energy grating ( heg ) spectrometer in the fe  k energy band .",
    "it is also typical of optical emission - line widths in the outer blr .",
    "the value of @xmath84 is approximately the velocity resolution of ccd detectors in the fe  k band .",
    "all emission - line spectra in fig .",
    "6 were calculated for an incident power - law spectrum with @xmath61 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "6 that the blending that results from velocity broadening can significantly dilute the characteristic features of the compton shoulder and the combined fe  k@xmath0 line profile .",
    "notice that the zeroth - order cores for the fe  k@xmath78 and fe  k@xmath79 components can not be distinguished as separate components even for a fwhm as low as @xmath85 ( this has already been pointed out in yaqoob et al .",
    "at a fwhm of @xmath83 the compton shoulder and line core are still resolved and the back - scattering peak is still resolved , although already heavily blended over the width of the shoulder . at a fwhm of @xmath84",
    "_ there is no shoulder to the line profile _ and the only trace of it is a slight asymmetry in the line profile .",
    "an obvious implication of this is that _ the compton shoulder can not be unambiguously resolved with ccd detectors_.",
    "we have studied the properties of the compton shoulder of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line in the toroidal x - ray reprocessor model of murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 ) for equatorial column densities in the range @xmath47 to @xmath2 for the case of a half - opening angle of @xmath3 and the cosmic abundances of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the shape of the compton shoulder and its flux relative to the core of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line provide important physical constraints on the line - emitting matter , including column density and orientation of the reprocessing structure .",
    "we have made our results available in a form ( the mytorus model ) that is suitable for direct spectral - fitting to real , high spectral - resolution data .",
    "we find that the ratio of the flux in the compton shoulder to that in the unscattered core component of the fe  k@xmath0 line increases approximately in proportion to @xmath21 until @xmath86 .",
    "the ratio reaches a maximum value that depends on the orientation of the torus ( @xmath43 for face - on and @xmath44 edge - on ) , at @xmath87 .",
    "the toroidal geometry gives a wider variety of compton shoulder profiles than either ( centrally - illuminated ) spherical or disk geometries .",
    "when the torus is observed with non - intercepting lines - of - sight , the shape of the compton shoulder of the fe  k@xmath0 line as a function of compton wavelength shift is approximately symmetrical over the wavelength interval corresponding to the first scattering . for intercepting lines - of - sight",
    "this symmetry is present in the optically - thin limit but the compton shoulder profile becomes weighted more and more towards the zero wavelength shift side of the profile as the column density increases , even to only @xmath88 .",
    "the asymmetry continues to increase up to @xmath87 .",
    "however , by @xmath89 the compton shoulder ( in the first scattering interval ) becomes symmetrical again .",
    "our monte carlo simulations have been performed with high statistical accuracy and reveal that the case of an edge - on , compton - thick torus produces a new type of compton shoulder that is unique to the toroidal geometry .",
    "it is dominated by a narrow back - scattering peak at @xmath4  kev .",
    "in addition , our results are sensitive enough to reveal a weak dependence of the shape of the compton shoulder and its magnitude ( relative to the fe  k@xmath0 line core ) , on the spectral shape of the incident x - ray continuum .",
    "we have also presented results on the effect of velocity broadening on the fe  k@xmath0 line profile and find that if either the velocity width or instrument resolution is greater than a fwhm of @xmath5 , the compton shoulder begins to become blended with the line core and the characteristic features of the compton shoulder become harder to resolve . in particular , at a fwhm of @xmath90 the compton shoulder is not resolved at all , its only signature being a weak asymmetry in the blended line profile .",
    "this means that ccd x - ray detectors can not unambiguously resolve the compton shoulder .",
    "the properties of the compton shoulder as a function of the torus opening angle ( or covering factor ) and the abundance of fe can not be trivially deduced and require much more extensive monte carlo simulations",
