    "the solar neutrino problem currently provides one of the most compelling experimental signatures for the physics beyond the standard model .",

    "the difficulty with astrophysical explanations persists even if we ignore data of any one of the three kinds of experiments , _ i.e. _ , the homestake chlorine experiment @xcite , the water erenkov experiments of kamiokande @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite , or the gallium experiments of sage @xcite and gallex @xcite .",
    "( the experimental results are summarized in table  [ tab : data ] along with the ssm predictions @xcite . )",
    "the successful results of gallium source experiments @xcite and the excellent agreement between the standard solar model predictions and the recent helioseismology data further reinforce our confidence in neutrino oscillation solutions @xcite .",
    "the new generation of solar neutrino experiments , such as super - kamiokande and sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) , will provide critical tests of the msw predictions for the neutrino energy spectrum distortion , the day - night rate asymmetry , and the charged - to - neutral current ratio .",
    "in this paper we examine the current status of the solar neutrino problem for astrophysical solutions , msw solutions , and vacuum oscillation solutions .",
    "the data as of february 1997 , including the final kamiokande results and the preliminary super - kamiokande data , are used .",
    "this is the first msw analysis using the entire data of the kamiokande spectrum and day - night asymmetry .",
    "we also incorporate the latest standard solar model with diffusion effects @xcite , the radiative corrections for the neutrino - electron scattering cross section @xcite , the improved determination of the @xmath1b decay spectrum @xcite , and the constraint on the gallium cross section from the source experiments @xcite .",
    "the calculations in this paper are described in detail in our previous works @xcite , including the model - independent analysis for astrophysical solutions , msw calculations , the day - night effect , and consistent treatment of solar model uncertainties .",
    "we consider only two - flavor oscillations because of their simplicity and viability .",
    "we referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent analysis for three - flavor oscillations and ref .",
    "@xcite for recent developments in neutrino physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : astrophysical - solutions ] we reexamine the general astrophysical solutions and show their failure with much stronger statistical significance than before .",
    "this is true even if we ignore any one of the three types of experiment or the solar luminosity constraint .",
    "we also discuss monte carlo evaluations of goodness of fit when the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) effectively becomes zero or negative . in section  [ sec : msw - solutions ] the constraints on the msw parameters are updated .",
    "the kamiokande spectrum result by itself excludes the adiabatic ( horizontal ) branch almost entirely . the msw solutions with nonstandard core temperatures , and with nonstandard @xmath1b flux , and oscillations to sterile neutrinos are also examined .",
    "vacuum oscillation solutions are discussed in section  [ sec : vacuum - oscillation - solutions ] .",
    "we show that the kamiokande spectrum data considerably restricts the allowed parameter space .",
    "the conclusions of our analysis are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the incompatibility of astrophysical solutions and the solar neutrino data has been investigated in many ways .",
    "these include the failure of explicit nonstandard solar models @xcite , the comparison of the homestake and kamiokande results @xcite , lower core temperature fits @xcite , and so on .",
    "one can generalize the argument against astrophysical solutions by a model independent analysis using @xmath2 , @xmath0be , @xmath1b , and cno fluxes as free parameters under minimal assumptions on the solar luminosity , the beta spectrum shape , and the detector cross sections .",
    "the details of our analysis is described in @xcite ( similar analyses are found in @xcite ) .",
    "we will display the results of the fits in the @xmath3 plane , both normalized to the ssm values ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 in units of @xmath6s@xmath7 @xcite ) .",
    "the constraints from individual data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beb_each ] . the combined result from kamiokande and",
    "super - kamiokande determines the @xmath1b flux only .",
    "the cno flux as well as the @xmath0be and @xmath1b fluxes are used as free parameters in fitting the homestake result . in fitting to the combined ga result from sage and gallex ,",
    "the @xmath2 flux is also varied as a free parameter subject to the luminosity constraint .    a comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : beb_each ] with our original analysis in 1993 ( fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite ) displays a dramatic improvement in statistics , especially in the water erenkov data and the gallium data .",
    "the addition of the high - statistics super - kamiokande result with about 1000 events from the first 100 days has reduced the uncertainty in the @xmath1b flux measurement in half .",
    "the low rate and the precision of the gallium result alone impose serious problems for astrophysical solutions .",
    "the @xmath1b flux allowed by the homestake and gallium data each is smaller than the kamiokande  super - kamiokande measurement for almost the entire range of the @xmath0be flux . in addition the homestake and gallium together are incompatible , since for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the gallium data requires the cno flux to be @xmath10 , while the homestake data requires the cno flux 4.9 times larger than the ssm value .",
    "the severity of the problem with astrophysical solutions can be seen by applying the joint analysis to all the data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beb_comb_cnozero ] .",
    "we allow the @xmath0be flux to be negative .. ] the best fit of the combined observations is in the non - physical region : @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 for 3 data points , one luminosity constraint , and four free parameters :",
    "i.e. , zero degrees of freedom ( dof ) . within physical parameter space ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , the best fit is @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the usual prescription for goodness of fit ( gof ) evaluations @xcite does not apply since we have zero dof .",
    "( later we will encounter fits with negative dof ) .",
    "in addition the probability distribution is non - gaussian due to the physical constraints , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fluxes should be non - negative .",
    "generalization of gof by employing the monte carlo method is necessary .",
    "gof in this case is defined by the probability to obtain @xmath19 as large as 9.2 or larger by chance due to the experimental uncertainties , if the best fit fluxes are true .",
    "our monte carlo construction is ( 1 ) to take the central flux values of the fit , ( 2 ) calculate the solar neutrino rates for the three experiments , ( 3 ) generate monte carlo distributions for each experiment assuming the actual experimental uncertainties ( 7.7 , 7.4 , and 9.7% for the homestake , kamiokande / super - kamiokande , and gallium experiments , respectively ) , ( 4 ) for each monte carlo data set , apply our model independent analysis to obtain the @xmath20 minimum . note that when one has @xmath21 parameters and @xmath22 constraints with gaussian errors and @xmath23 , this procedure can be done analytically , reproducing the usual @xmath20 distribution for @xmath24 dimensions @xcite .    the monte carlo distribution of the @xmath20 minima is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gof_lin_comb ] ; the @xmath18 from the actual data is also indicated .",
    "the probability of getting @xmath20 minimum larger than 9.2 by chance is 0.6% .",
    "that is , our model independent analysis excludes the best fit astrophysical solution at the 99.4% c.l . corresponds to 99.8% c.l . if one defines gof by the ratio of the volume of the likelihood function integrated within the physical region to the volume integrated in the entire parameter space ( including negative fluxes ) , the ratio is 0.2% , or the exclusion is 99.8% c.l .",
    "thus , the both estimates are similar to the monte carlo result . ]",
    "next we consider the same analysis but ignoring one of the constraints .",
    "[ fig : beb_kam+ga ] , [ fig : beb_cl+ga ] , and [ fig : beb_kam+cl ] show the results each without the homestake data , the water erenkov data , and the gallium data , respectively .",
    "[ fig : beb_comb_nolumi ] is the result with all experiments , but without the luminosity constraint .",
    "( violations of the luminosity constraint would be possible if the properties of the solar core were somehow varying on a time scale short compared with @xmath25 years . )",
    "the corresponding gof of the best fit in the physical region is 98.9 , 98.3 , 98.9 , and 98.3% c.l .",
    ", respectively . although the constraints on the fluxes are somewhat relaxed by ignoring one of the data or the luminosity constraint , the essential problem with the poor fit remains . in addition",
    "one can also see the persistent problem of the strong suppression of the @xmath0be flux , which is difficult to obtain by astrophysical effects in general .",
    "the kamiokande experiment has completed its measurements and published the results of total rate , spectrum data , and day - night data @xcite .",
    "the msw parameters can be constrained by those results .",
    "note that the spectrum distortions and day - night time - dependence are not expected with standard neutrino physics and are powerful indicators of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the spectrum shape measured in kamiokande is consistent with the one expected from the undistorted @xmath1b @xmath26-decay spectrum albeit the uncertainties are large .",
    "the shape is inconsistent with the strong suppressions at large energies expected in the msw adiabatic branch ( @xmath27 ev@xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , and the data exclude the region almost entirely as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_exclusion ] .",
    "this exclusion is simply due to lack of distortions in the data and independent of the uncertainties in the initial @xmath1b flux .",
    "the data , however , do not constrain the nonadiabatic ( diagonal ) branch , in which spectrum distortions are smaller .",
    "the day - night result was published as one day - time rate and five bins for night - time bins .",
    "the binning was @xmath30 , @xmath31 , ... @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the angle between the direction to the sun and the nadir at the detector . within the experimental uncertainties",
    "the six bins are consistent and thus exclude a large region in which day - night asymmetries due to the earth effect are expected .",
    "the excluded region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_exclusion ] .    the allowed parameter space from the total kamiokande rate is shown in fig .  [ fig : fkam_ave ] .",
    "this constraint is model dependent and we have assumed the bahcall - pinsonneault model ( 1995 ) @xcite including its uncertainties . in this and",
    "other fits the correlation in the theoretical uncertainties between the flux components and between the experiments are included .",
    "unfortunately we can not combine the spectrum and day - night data since the errors in those are strongly correlated and the correlation matrix is unpublished .",
    "[ fig : fkam_sp ] and [ fig : fkam_dn ] show the allowed region when the total rate is combined with the spectrum data and day - night data , respectively .",
    "recently the super - kamiokande collaboration reported the results of about 1000 events from the first 100 days of data @xcite .",
    "the total rate ( see table  [ tab : data ] ) is consistent with the previous kamiokande rate , and new uncertainties are much smaller .",
    "when combined with the kamiokande total rate , the error is reduced almost by half .",
    "the new constraint is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fkam_comb ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the msw parameter space are now dominated by the @xmath1b flux error in the solar model calculations ( @xmath34 15% ) .",
    "future measurements of model - independent quantities such as the spectrum shape and day - night effect and also the charged - to - neutral current ratio in sno , are essential to confirm the msw interpretation and to improve the determination of the msw parameters .",
    "we next consider the msw constraint including the homestake and gallium data .",
    "the two separate allowed regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_comb ] .",
    "the fit includes kamiokande day - night data and the averaged super - kamiokande data .",
    "( the allowed regions are essentially identical even if the kamiokande spectrum data are used . )",
    "both allowed regions provide a good fit .",
    "the @xmath20 minimum for 7 degrees of freedom is 5.9 ( 55% c.l . ) and 6.4 ( 49% c.l . ) for the small - angle and large - angle solution , respectively .",
    "( details are listed in table  [ tab : msw - fit ] . )",
    "the fit for the large - angle solution improved from previous analyses ( see for example ref  @xcite ) due to the larger @xmath1b flux in the new ssm and a new , smaller kamiokande and super - kamiokande rate , both of which reduces the relative difference between the homestake rate and the kamiokande / super - kamiokande rate and allows energy - independent flux reduction as expected in the large - angle region .",
    "we have also considered oscillations to sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the gof for the large angle region is 94% c.l .",
    "however , the 95% allowed region defined by @xmath35 does not appear in the @xmath36  @xmath37 parameter space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p_comb_sterile ] and table  [ tab : msw - fit - sterile ] ) .",
    "the large angle solution for sterile neutrinos is also severely constrained by big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "while nonstandard solar models , as discussed in section  [ sec : astrophysical - solutions ] , can not solve the solar neutrino problem , the msw effect can be also considered with nonstandard solar models @xcite .",
    "many of those models may be parameterize by nonstandard core temperature ( @xmath38 ) or simply a nonstandard @xmath1b flux , whose uncertainties might be larger than the ssm estimate .",
    "we consider joint fits of @xmath38 or @xmath1b flux , in addition to the msw parameters .",
    "when @xmath38 is used as a free parameter , the neutrino fluxes can be scaled according to the power law . from the monte carlo investigation of the ssm ,",
    "the indices of the power law are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the monte carlo ssms by bahcall and ulrich @xcite .",
    "the combined homestake , gallium , kamiokande , and super - kamiokande data constrain @xmath39 and @xmath40 for 95% c.l . , where @xmath41 is the the ssm value ( @xmath42k ) .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the ssm range @xmath43 @xcite : the data are consistent with the ssm prediction in the presence of the msw effect .",
    "our likelihood for @xmath38 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - p ] .",
    "the corresponding msw parameter space is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_comb_tcfree ] .    next the @xmath1b flux is used as a free parameter , the combined data determines @xmath44 and 0.31  1.50 for 95% c.l .",
    "although the uncertainty is large , the result is consistent with the ssm range @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "our likelihood for @xmath46 and the corresponding msw regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b - p ] and [ fig : p_comb_bfree ] .",
    "the simple two - flavor vacuum oscillations are still a phenomenologically viable solution @xcite .",
    "those solutions require tuning of @xmath37 and the sun - earth distance at the 5% level to explain the observations , which is a conceptual setback .",
    "some parameter space for the vacuum oscillation for @xmath47 ev@xmath28 predicts a relatively strong energy dependence , and the recent kamiokande spectrum data alone can exclude a wide range of parameters , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vexclusion_kam_sp ] .",
    "when combined with the results of homestake , gallium , and super - kamiokande , we find three separate allowed regions within a narrow range of parameters [ @xmath48 ev@xmath28 and @xmath49 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vfcomb+sk+kam_sp ] .",
    "the gof for the best fit parameters is 9.9 for 9 dof , which is acceptable .",
    "details of the fits are listed in table  [ tab : vacuum - fit ] for comparison we show five allowed regions when the kamiokande spectrum data are ignored fig .  [",
    "fig : vfcomb+sk ] ) .",
    "although the general scope of the solar neutrino problem has not chanced since the first result of the gallium experiment in 1992 , the improved accuracy of the solar neutrino data provide a more robust assessment of solutions . the astrophysical solutions in general have difficulties unless all experiments are wrong , or at least two out of three data and the ssm are wrong .",
    "the msw effect provides viable solutions : the small mixing - angle solution ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ev@xmath28 ) and the large - angle solution ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ev@xmath28 ) , assuming the latest ssm by bahcall and pinsonneault .",
    "oscillations to sterile neutrinos are possible , but only for small angles .",
    "when the core temperature or the @xmath1b flux is used as a free parameter , the joint data determines those at the 3% and 30% level , respectively .",
    "those ranges are consistent with the ssm predictions .",
    "vacuum oscillations are still viable for @xmath54 ev@xmath28 and @xmath55 .",
    "the kamiokande day - night data and spectrum data each exclude a large parameter space for msw , independent of ssm predictions .",
    "we expect super - kamiokande will provide those with much improved accuracy and eventually , along with the sno neutral current measurement , single out the solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
