    "<S> if there is a fundamental length , @xmath4 , then from the results on the muon ( g-2 ) we have    @xmath5    this leads us to the following estimate @xmath6 with model dependent arguments one can accommodate an @xmath4 such that @xmath7 , but not much better . </S>",
    "<S> however , the following assertion can be safely made : _ today , we have no experimental evidence that can rule out the existence of a  fundamental length , \" @xmath4 , such that @xmath8_.@xmath9    one should add that we have already reached the end of the road as far as learning more from qed and ( g-2 ) regarding this issue . at the level of @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> both electroweak and hadronic contributions to ( g-2 ) become important .    </S>",
    "<S> the forward dispersion relations for @xmath11 and @xmath12 scattering represent one of the few general rigorous consequences of local quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> one tests their validity by measuring @xmath13 , and comparing the results with the calculated @xmath2 obtained from the dispersion relations with @xmath14 as an input . </S>",
    "<S> these tests have been carried out at increasing energies for both @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the highest energy , @xmath12 only , is @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between theory and experiment is good , as can be seen from figure 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of @xmath2 at @xmath16 will explore a short distance domain about which we have little previous knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the preceeding measurements which dealt with length scales that had already been pre - explored by qed .    however , there is a problem . </S>",
    "<S> the particle physics folklore includes statements to the effect that short distance structure shows up first , and in more easily detectable ways , in , and not in such as forward elastic scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , when statements like the above are repeated for 35 years , people get to be rather sloppy in using them . in this brief talk </S>",
    "<S> i will clarify this problem and show that in a domain where the dispersion relations no longer hold , @xmath2 is extremely sensitive to the existence of a fundamental length , @xmath4 , and changes drastically even when @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dilemma between hard and soft collisions can be clarified as follows . given some kind of structure at short distance , @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , we can make the following correct statement :    _ as we approach the energy region such that @xmath18 is non - negligible , then hard cross - sections will in general show a more detectable and larger change than soft cross - sections_.    this statement , though not extremely precise , is in general qualitatively correct . </S>",
    "<S> however , if in the same statement we replace by then the statement is false , as we shall demonstrate by counterexample . of course when local qft is valid , then for the forward scattering amplitude , @xmath19 , if @xmath20 does not change much in a certain region so will @xmath21 and @xmath2 because one can use the dispersion relation to get @xmath2 from @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> but , in a world in which the dispersion relations or qft fail , @xmath2 as we shall show below can be extremely sensitive to a breakdown in qft .    </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this talk is to give a  counterexample \" to the statement about soft amplitudes being insensitive to a short distance breakdown in qft . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , i will show that when traditional qft is changed by a breakdown in polynomial boundedness , which in many models is the main feature of the existence of a fundamental length , then the phase , @xmath2 , could change by more than a factor of 2 even for energies as low as @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens without any significant change in @xmath14 or @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> before we present our  counterexample \" , we summarize briefly the well established properties of @xmath19 in local qft . </S>",
    "<S> we have the following : i ) @xmath19 is analytic in the doubly cut s - plane ; ii ) @xmath19 is crossing symmetric , relating @xmath11 for @xmath24 to @xmath12 for @xmath25 ; iii ) @xmath26 satisfies the optical theorem , @xmath27 ; iv ) @xmath19 is polynomially bounded in all directions in the cut complex s - plane , @xmath28    we have argued in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , that the most likely property to change is iv ) , i.e. equation ( 3 ) . properties ii ) and iii ) are on a solid footing . </S>",
    "<S> while even if property i ) , analyticity , fails due to some new complex singularities on the physical sheet , these will not lead to a strong signal except for @xmath29 ( new singularities ) .    the breakdown in iv ) </S>",
    "<S> replaces equ . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) by an exponential bound : @xmath30    in fact we claim more . </S>",
    "<S> namely , that along some complex s direction , @xmath31 grows exponentially like @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> note that a behavior of the type @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , is excluded due to some technical mathematical arguments . </S>",
    "<S> hence one goes from @xmath35 behavior to a first order exponential in @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several examples which exhibit the behavior ( 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are :    a. ) non - local potential scattering    here one replaces the interaction term in the schrodinger equation , by a non - local one , i.e. , @xmath37 where @xmath38    b. ) some nonlocal field theories .    </S>",
    "<S> c. ) string - theory@xmath39 ( @xmath40    once we have exponential behavior in @xmath41 we have a natural way to a  fundamental length \" . </S>",
    "<S> noting that @xmath42 momentum for large @xmath43 , then the @xmath4 we use in the bound to make a dimensionless exponent is by definition our fundamental length . </S>",
    "<S> we take the smallest @xmath4 such that for some complex sequence @xmath44 , as @xmath45 , @xmath26 actually grows like @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> our main counterexample is a representative of what happens in non - local potential scattering as defined by equ . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it also mimics the behavior of some non - local field theories , although these admittedly have serious problems .    in non - local potential scattering one </S>",
    "<S> can easily prove the analyticity of @xmath47 , but @xmath26 is not polynomially bounded as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can prove that @xmath49 as @xmath48 in all directions . </S>",
    "<S> the physical sheet here corresponds to @xmath50 , and @xmath4 is defined in equ.(6 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these facts lead us to the following ansatz : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the true amplitude , and @xmath53 is a  false \" amplitude defined by ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the true amplitude satisfies the optical theorem , @xmath54 , but @xmath55 is not necessarily positive . </S>",
    "<S> however , by definition it is @xmath56 that is polynomially bounded . </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath56 satisfies the dispersion relations albeit with a non - positive @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath57 has no dispersion relation because of its exponential growth when @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> at first the ansatz(7 ) looks like a tautology , or at best a definition of @xmath53.nevertheless , because of the special properties of @xmath2 for @xmath60 we can still learn much from this ansatz .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider two energy regions . </S>",
    "<S> a  low \" energy region @xmath61 , and a  transitional \" region @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we also note the fact that for @xmath63 , @xmath2 is small and decreases logarithmically . at @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that cosmic ray data tell us that @xmath14 will continue to increase , @xmath66 , the dispersion relation fit shown by the curve in figure 1 , will continue to decrease slowly as @xmath41 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the two energy regions separately .    a. low energy region , @xmath67    in this region , we have @xmath68    there is no observable difference between the polynomially bounded amplitude and the exponentially bounded one .    b. transitional region    here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 is small but not negligible , @xmath70    note that @xmath41 is still well below @xmath71 .    from the ansatz(7 ) , we obtain @xmath72,\\ ] ]    at this stage it is important to remark that the second term in the bracket in ( 10 ) is doubly small , @xmath73 is small and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath75.\\ ] ]    to proceed further let us assume that in the transitional region , @xmath76 , a bound almost 2.5 times larger than the value of @xmath2 at @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we hasten to add that this assumption is not really needed , but it gives us a quick way to arrive at our result . </S>",
    "<S> later we shall show how one can get the same result without this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> we now have , @xmath78,\\ ] ] for @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the transitional region @xmath80 , and hence @xmath81 for @xmath82 and the optical theorem holds for @xmath55 to a very good approximation . but @xmath53 satisfies a dispersion relation , and we can therefore use the approximate derivative form of the dispersion relations@xmath83 to get @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the dispersion relation fit to @xmath2 as the one shown by the continuous curve in figure 1 .    the  true \" and  false \" phases are related by @xmath86 with @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> after some simple algebra we get @xmath88 but @xmath89 in the transitional region . replacing @xmath90 by @xmath66 in ( 15 ) and expanding in powers of @xmath91 , we get @xmath92 the error , @xmath93 , is determined by @xmath94    there are two important features of our final result ( 16 ) which should be stressed . </S>",
    "<S> first , while @xmath66 decreases logarithmically the additional term @xmath95 increases linearly with @xmath41 , and even when @xmath96 it leads to a 75% increase in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the second feature is the fact that @xmath4 appears linearly in ( 16 ) , unlike the correction to the muon ( g-2 ) in equ . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) which was @xmath97 , with @xmath98 appearing in the correction . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath4 is very small , this makes the qed case less sensitive to a fundamental length .    in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath73 for @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath2 is sensitive is amply demonstrated .    in closing </S>",
    "<S> , we explain briefly how our assumption on @xmath100 can be removed . </S>",
    "<S> one has to divide the interval , @xmath101 , into @xmath102 small intervals , @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> then one carries out the same calculation we did above step by step starting at @xmath104 , and calculating @xmath73 at the next point . at each step one uses the approximation @xmath105 . the result given by equ.(16 ) </S>",
    "<S> remains the same .    </S>",
    "<S> there are other examples which lead to a decrease in @xmath2 rather than the increase given by the ansatz ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example one could have instead of ( 7 ) , @xmath106    this leads to @xmath107 with the result shown in figure 1 for @xmath108 , and labeled as case ii .    </S>",
    "<S> our ansatz is an example of a whole class where one can write @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is an entire function of order 1 . </S>",
    "<S> all these lead , via similar arguments , to a dramatic change in @xmath2 , @xmath111 where @xmath112 .    in conclusion , @xmath2 is extremely sensitive to a short distance breakdown of qft , and more so if that breakdown is manifested by the failure of polynomial boundedness and its replacement by exponential growth which is order 1 in the variable @xmath113 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath114 is the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> momentum in forward scattering , and @xmath4 we take , by definition , to be the  fundamental length \" .    strictly within the context of this picture </S>",
    "<S> , we can set the following limits on a breakdown in polynomial boundedness :    1 . ) @xmath115 gives us a lower limit for @xmath116 , @xmath117 .    2 . </S>",
