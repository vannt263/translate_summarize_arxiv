    "polarimetric wide - field imaging is a recent and important trend in radio astronomy .",
    "many new and planned radio telescopes such as lofar , lwa , mwa , and ska have a wide field - of - view ( fov ) as a major feature .",
    "technologically , this has been made possible by the development of phased dipole arrays and focal plane arrays , both of which have an inherently wider fov than traditional single - pixel radio telescopes .",
    "the motivation for wide fov polarimetric radio telescopes in astronomy is that they facilitate the study of polarized phenomena not restricted to narrow fields such as the large , highly - structured , polarized features discovered in recent polarimetric galactic surveys @xcite . with lofar now producing its first _ all - sky _ images @xcite , a new era of polarimetric wide - field imaging is starting in radio astronomy .    despite this trend ,",
    "a complete theory for wide - field , polarimetric astronomical interferometry is lacking . ultimately , classical interferometry is based on the far - zone form of the van cittert - zernike ( vc - z ) theorem @xcite which",
    ", in its original form , is a scalar theory and only valid for narrow fields .",
    "such restrictions are obviously unacceptable in astronomy where polarization often provides crucial astronomical information , and sources are distributed on the celestial sphere , not necessarily limited to small patches . in radio astronomy , a polarimetric , or vector ( i.e. non - scalar ) , extension of the narrow - field vc - z theorem",
    "was given by @xcite , and more recently this was given a consistent mathematical foundation by @xcite in the form of the so - called _ measurement equation _",
    "( m.e . ) of radio astronomy",
    ". on the other hand , a wide - field extension of the scalar vc - z theorem for radio astronomy was given by @xcite , and more recently , imaging techniques for scalar , wide - fields have been an active field of research @xcite .",
    "however , a generalised vc - z theorem for radio astronomy that is both polarimetric and wide - field has not been derived",
    ". this may be because it has been assumed that such a theorem would be a trivial vector- or matrix - valued analogue of the wide - field , scalar theory @xcite . as we will see , however , the final result is not that simple .",
    "the purpose of the present work is therefore to derive a vc - z type relation by generalising the standard m.e .",
    "formalism to allow for arbitrarily wide fields .",
    "this is achieved by generalising the two - component jones formalism to a three - component wolf formalism @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will derive a vc - z relation that is valid for the entire celestial sphere and is fully polarimetric .",
    "we will show that the standard m.e . can be recovered through a two - dimensional projection .",
    "we will also show that a dual - polarized interferometer of short electric dipoles ( hertzian dipoles ) is inherently aberrated polarimetrically .",
    "we also extend our vc - z relation to include not only the full electric field , but also the full magnetic field , and thereby establish the complete second - order statistical description of the electromagnetic relation between source terms and interferometer response .",
    "our wide - field vc - z relations should be of relevance to the subject of _ direction - dependent effects _ in radio interferometric imaging , which has attracted recent attention @xcite .",
    "the vc - z theorem as used in astronomy is different from its original use in optical coherence . in astronomy one images sources on the celestial sphere based on localised measurements of their far - fields",
    "this is possible because the vc - z theorem provides an explicit relationship between the visibility measured directly by an interferometer and the brightness distribution of the sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap 14 ) .",
    "this makes the vc - z relationship the foundation of synthesis mapping and interferometric imaging . despite its importance",
    ", the vc - z relations in use in astronomy are all either based on the paraxial approximation ( narrow fov ) or they take the source emissions to be scalar .",
    "these simplifications are questionable when the sources cover wide fields or are highly polarized , as is often the case in radio astronomy .    here",
    "we derive the full vector electromagnetic analogue to the wide - field , scalar vc - z relation derived in ( * ? ? ? * chap 14 ) , and , as we will see , the final result is not simply a matrix- or vector - valued version of the scalar relation .",
    "we seek a relationship between the electromagnetic field coherence of a distribution of radio astronomical sources and the resulting electromagnetic field coherence at a radio astronomical interferometer . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we will use the term _",
    "interferometer _ as a shorthand for radio astronomical interferometer .",
    "the treatment is intended for earth - based interferometer observations , but it also has space - based radio astronomical interferometry in mind .        consider the problem illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordsys]a ) .",
    "radio emissions from far away sources , such as the point source @xmath0 , are measured by an interferometer located in the domain @xmath1 .",
    "we want to establish a relationship between the coherence of the electric field emanating from a source distribution and the coherence of the electric field in @xmath1 .",
    "let us first consider a single point source @xmath0 located at @xmath2 .",
    "the source is thus at a distance @xmath3 in the direction given by the unit vector ( direction cosines ) @xmath4 with respect to the origin @xmath5 approximately at the centre of @xmath1 .",
    "the source is within the interferometers fov @xmath6 which is centred on point @xmath7 on the celestial sphere .",
    "the electric field from @xmath0 is measured by the interferometer at pairs of positions @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 is assumed to be bounded , so the maximum distance between any two measurement points @xmath10 ( maximum baseline ) is finite .",
    "although the source emission may be broadband we split it into narrow , quasi - monochromatic , spectral bands and consider a typical narrow ( bandwidth much smaller than centre frequency ) band centred on frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath0 is very far away , which quantitatively we take to mean that @xmath12 for all @xmath13 , implies that the entire interferometer is in the far - field of the source .",
    "this means that the electric field @xmath14 at point @xmath8 at time @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the complex electric field amplitude vector emitted by the source at @xmath19 in the direction of @xmath8 .    furthermore , in the far - field , @xmath20 is approximately transverse so that @xmath21 if we further assume that the angular extent of @xmath1 as seen from @xmath0 is small , that is @xmath22 then the interferometer is in the fraunhofer far - field of the sources . in this case",
    "we can use the approximations @xmath23 and @xmath24 to simplify the expression for the electric field in @xmath1 to @xmath25 where @xmath26 here we have dropped the first argument of @xmath20 since we are assuming that the angular variation of the sources emissions is small enough so that the @xmath23 approximation implies that @xmath27 .    a similar expression to equation ( [ eq : diselcontribvecapprox ] ) for the field at @xmath9",
    "is obtained by replacing @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the electric coherence matrix ( tensor ) @xmath30 can then be found by taking the outer product of the electric fields @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes complex conjugation , @xmath33 denotes time averaging , and the subscripts @xmath34 label cartesian components @xmath35 , which we will define more precisely later .",
    "we have written the electric coherence matrix , equation ( [ eq : ecohmat ] ) , as a @xmath36 complex matrix even though , for the single point source we are considering here , its rank is two and could therefore be expressed as a @xmath37 complex matrix .",
    "we keep the electric coherence matrix as a @xmath36 complex matrix since it is valid even when there are more than one point source .",
    "we now move to the case of a finite number of point sources .",
    "the total electric field measured at points @xmath8 and @xmath9 is now the sum of the fields from sources in directions @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the electric coherence matrix is therefore @xmath40 for @xmath41 . in going from the double to the single sum we used the usual vc - z assumption that the sources are spatially incoherent , that is , sources in different directions are statistically independent .    until now we have considered only discrete sources .",
    "we can make the transition to the more general continuum source distribution by introducing the three - dimensional brightness matrix @xmath42 as a function of direction @xmath19 in a continuous source distribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the infinitesimal area of the source distribution .",
    "the superscript is to highlight the fact that @xmath42 is three - dimensional as opposed the usual two - dimensional brightness matrix @xcite .",
    "the reason that the brightness matrix here is three - dimensional is simply because the full electric field amplitude @xmath20 is three - dimensional .",
    "however , due to equation ( [ eq : transcondapprox ] ) , not all the components of @xmath42 are arbitrary . in fact , we will show that it can be recast as one two - dimensional matrix .    by making the replacement ( [ eq : defbrithree ] ) in equation ( [ eq : discretesrcecorr ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an infinitesimal solid angle of the source distribution in @xmath6 . in this expression",
    "we see that the dependence on the pairs of position is only relative , that is , the coherence matrix depends only on @xmath47 , and so we recast the expression in terms of the vector @xmath48 also known as the baseline vector measured in wavelengths ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "in practice , rather than use @xmath30 directly , it is convenient and conventional to put the phase reference point at the centre of the fov given by the direction @xmath50 .",
    "the result of the change in phase , @xmath51 is the 3@xmath523 generalisation of the standard 2@xmath522 visibility matrix as defined by , for instance , @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 is a general complex matrix except for @xmath54 where it is hermitian .",
    "it fulfill the symmetry relation @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for hermitian transpose .",
    "if we use @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : continumize ] ) we arrive at @xmath57    equation ( [ eq : vcz3dimpl ] ) is a matrix version of the wide - field , scalar vc - z relation and so includes the partial polarization of the ( non - scalar ) source distribution . however , it is not very useful in this form since it does not automatically fulfill the constraint ( [ eq : transcondapprox ] ) .",
    "when applied to @xmath42 , this constraint becomes @xmath58 for all directions @xmath19 , where @xmath19 is understood to be a column vector .",
    "the constraint can , however , easily be removed if we express @xmath20 in terms of spherical base vectors and set the radial component to zero .",
    "this leads us to introduce two coordinate systems : a cartesian and a spherical .",
    "we use the angular , or tangential , basis set @xmath59 of a spherical polar coordinate system as the basis for the polarization of the transverse field of the source distribution on the celestial sphere , see fig .",
    "1b ) . to simplify the results , the spherical coordinate system is taken relative to the phase reference position of the interferometer assumed to be at @xmath7 . in other words , the zero point of the spherical system , @xmath60 , ( intersection of the equator and central meridian ) , is taken to coincide with @xmath7",
    "@xmath61 is the angle from the equator ( positive in the hemisphere with the pole @xmath62 and negative in the other hemisphere ) , and @xmath63 is the position angle from the central meridian around @xmath64 in the anticlockwise sense looking along @xmath64 . in lieu of any other reference directions ,",
    "the orientation of the spherical system around @xmath7 is arbitrary , but for earth - based measurements @xmath62 could be directed towards the north pole or zenith .",
    "one should note that @xmath59 are consistent with ludwig s second definition as detailed in @xcite with the understanding that the antenna boresight in @xcite is here at @xmath7 , that ludwig s reference polarization unit vector @xmath65 is here @xmath66 , and ludwig s cross polarization unit vector @xmath67 is here @xmath68 .",
    "see @xcite for the use of ludwig s third definition in a vc - z relation .",
    "the cartesian system , with base vectors @xmath69 , is defined so that @xmath70 is in the direction of @xmath7 , and @xmath71 is in the direction of the pole @xmath62 . in terms of the cartesian system , we can explicitly write the components of the vectors in equation ( [ eq : vcz3dimpl ] ) as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and where the superscript @xmath74 stands for vector transpose .",
    "all these vectors are unit vectors with real - valued components ranging between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these definitions of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 spaces are the same as the usual definitions for earth - based observations , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "also the matrices in equation ( [ eq : vcz3dimpl ] ) are to be considered in what follows as being expressed in the cartesian system .",
    "the relationships between the spherical and cartesian systems base vectors are @xmath79    using these spherical and cartesian systems we can express the three - dimensional transverse electric field as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the jones vector in spherical ( rather than the usual cartesian ) components and @xmath82 is the @xmath83 transformation matrix between the components given by the equations ( [ eq : phixyz ] ) and ( [ eq : thetaxyz ] ) .",
    "note that this transformation is possible for all directions on the celestial sphere except for @xmath84 , i.e. , the poles of the spherical coordinate system .",
    "if one wishes to use to a polar spherical system in which the centre of the fov is not on the equator , as it is here , but rather at some declination @xmath85 , then one simply replaces @xmath86 with @xmath87 defined in appendix [ sec : coordtrans ] , equation ( [ eq : sph2cart_gen ] ) .",
    "this assumes that the pole @xmath62 is towards the earth s north pole .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath88 so the transverse electric field expressed according to equation ( [ eq : cartastrans ] ) does indeed fulfill equation ( [ eq : transcondapprox ] ) .",
    "so if we use @xmath89 rather than @xmath20 in equation ( [ eq : vcz3dimpl ] ) we would have an unconstrained vc - z equation .",
    "we can introduce this replacement by rewriting @xmath42 using equation ( [ eq : cartastrans ] ) , so @xmath90 where , suppressing the dependence on @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the 2@xmath522 brightness matrix , but in spherical rather than cartesian coordinates . by this we mean that , for an arbitrary direction @xmath91 , @xmath93 is locally equivalent to the usual paraxial brightness matrix in cartesian coordinates . from its definition it easy to see that @xmath93 is a hermitian matrix .    by using the @xmath78 and @xmath77 spaces , as spanned by the vectors @xmath19 , and @xmath94",
    ", we can write equation ( [ eq : vcz3dimpl ] ) in a more explicit form . the exact form , though , depends on the extent of @xmath6 .",

    "if , however , part of @xmath6 is in the @xmath101 hemisphere , then we must add to equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) the contribution from this hemisphere given by the integral @xmath102}}{|n| } \\,\\mathrm{d}l\\mathrm{d}m ,    \\label{eq : vcz3dmin}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the subset of @xmath6 in the @xmath101 hemisphere .",
    "the image horizon , @xmath104 , can also be included by reparametrising the integral in terms of @xmath105 rather than @xmath91 and using the replacement @xmath106 .",
    "the poles @xmath107 can also be imaged , but one must then stipulate the orientation of the @xmath68 and @xmath66 vectors at these singular points .",
    "now , by extending @xmath108 to cover the entire @xmath95 hemisphere and extending @xmath108 to cover the entire @xmath101 hemisphere , the entire celestial sphere can be imaged in a single telescope pointing .",
    "an assumption here is that @xmath1 is a proper three - dimensional volume , or in other words , the baselines should be non - coplanar . if @xmath1 is just a plane ( coplanar baselines )",
    "then only one hemisphere can be mapped uniquely .",
    "equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) is our main result .",
    "it says that the full @xmath36 electric visibility matrix @xmath53 on the three - dimensional @xmath77 space is given by the @xmath37 brightness matrix @xmath93 on the two - dimensional @xmath109 plane .",
    "the fact that this is a relationship between two matrices with different matrix dimensions is a fundamental feature of our vc - z , and makes it clear that it is not just a matrix - valued generalisation of the wide - field , scalar vc - z .",
    "mathematically , this is ultimately due to the ranks of the fundamental matrices , of which we will speak more in section [ sec : stokesparams ] .",
    "the remaining vc - z relationships that form a complete characterisation of the electromagnetic coherence response of a radio astronomical interferometer are given in appendix [ emvcz ] .",
    "in the previous section we derived a vc - z relation , equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) , in which the visibility matrix is determined from the brightness matrix .",
    "it is well known that the original vc - z theorem ( far - zone form ) for narrow - fields states that there is a two - dimensional fourier transform relationship between visibility and brightness . in astronomical interferometry the transform aspect of this relationship is exploited to produce brightness images from measured visibility .",
    "the wide - field vc - z , equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) , is not a two - dimensional fourier transform , but , as we will now show , it is still possible invert it and thereby establish a sort of generalised transform .",
    "first we should state that there are several ways of expressing @xmath93 in terms of @xmath53 , even though the wide - field vc - z relation , equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) , is a one - to - one relationship in general .",
    "this is because @xmath53 has redundancies , as one can expect considering the asymmetry in the respective matrix dimensions of @xmath93 and @xmath53 .",
    "so although the rank of @xmath53 is three in general , it is overdetermined if @xmath93 is known .",
    "we will first derive a solution that is valid for the entire celestial sphere based on the full @xmath53 .",
    "the case when only a projection of @xmath53 is available will be discussed in section [ sec : dual - pol - int ] .",
    "consider that we are given the full @xmath110 and that we would like to solve equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) for @xmath93 . by extending the solution of the scalar problem described in @xcite to the three - dimensional matrix relationship in equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) we find that one approximate solution is @xmath111 }     \\ , \\mathrm{d}u\\mathrm{d}v\\mathrm{d}w \\mathrm{d}n .",

    ", we can find a solution for the two - dimensional brightness matrix , @xmath115 an analogous expression applies for @xmath116 but with the integration over @xmath117 running from @xmath75 to @xmath118 rather than @xmath118 to @xmath119 . for @xmath104 ,",
    "an expression can be obtained by using the @xmath105 parametrised vc - z mentioned in the previous section .",
    "we can now state the generalised transform as @xmath120 where @xmath121 reads `` is wide - field , polarimetric vc - z related to '' .",
    "the relation from brightness matrix to visibility matrix is given ( for @xmath95 ) by equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) , and the relation from visibility matrix to brightness matrix is given by equations ( [ eq : bri2frombri3 ] ) and ( [ eq : vcz3dinv ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath121 relation is not simply a two - dimensional fourier transform as in the narrow - field case .",
    "furthermore , the difference in the dimensionality of @xmath53 and @xmath93 make it clear that equation ( [ eq : vcz3drel ] ) can not simply be a matrix generalisation of the scalar vc - z relation , as is sometimes assumed .",
    "in practice it is common to use stokes parameters to characterise the brightness and visibility matrices over narrow fields . let us see how stokes parameters can be applied to the wide - field vc - z relation , equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) .",
    "let us first consider brightnesses .",
    "the difference between the two - dimensional brightness matrix @xmath93 in equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) and the usual two - dimensional brightness matrix in the paraxial approximation is that the former is defined on a spherical domain while the latter is defined on a cartesian plane .",
    "locally , for a source at some @xmath91 , the two brightness matrices can be made equal .",
    "thus we can define the stokes parameters in terms of the components of @xmath93 with respect to a spherical basis @xmath59 in analogy with cartesian basis as @xmath122 when the spherical system is aligned as it is in section [ sec : wolfvcz ] such that the intersection of its central meridian and its equator is located at the centre of the fov and the pole @xmath62 is towards the earth s north pole , then in a sufficiently narrow field around the centre of the fov the stokes brightnesses @xmath123 are approximately equal to the stokes parameters of the iau @xcite . if one wishes to conform with iau stokes parameters over the entire celestial sphere , then one can use equation ( [ eq : stokesbright ] ) with @xmath86 replaced by @xmath124 , equation ( [ eq : sph2cart_gen ] ) , where @xmath125 is the declination of the centre of the fov .",
    "the correspondence is then that @xmath126 is the iau s @xmath127 , and @xmath128 is the iau s @xmath129 .",
    "note however that the iau basis set for polarimetry is not the same as the cartesian basis set widely used in radio interferometry for defining source directions and baselines , which in this paper is denoted @xmath69 . in adopting both these systems , therefore",
    ", a sacrifice must be made , and we have chosen to slightly modify the usual pauli matrices that are used to relate the brightness matrix to the stokes parameters . explicitly , the brightness matrix in terms of the stokes parameters in equation ( [ eq : stokesbright ] ) is in this paper @xmath130 as can be seen , the expansion of this expression into unitary matrices , as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) , leads to matrices equivalent to pauli matrices but with a change of overall sign for the matrices associated with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    in terms of equation ( [ eq : stokesbright ] ) , we can write the three - dimensional brightness matrix in equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) as @xmath133 where @xmath134 it is easy to see that the @xmath135 for @xmath136 depend only on @xmath137 , and that they become the three - dimensional analogs of the equivalent pauli matrices in equation ( [ eq : britwoinstokes ] ) .    equation ( [ eq : b3instokes ] ) shows that for every look - direction @xmath91 , the three - dimensional brightness matrix has four degrees of freedom , here expressed as the four stokes parameters . in other words ,",
    "the four stokes parameters completely characterise the partially polarized brightness also for wide fields , under the assumptions made in the derivation of equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) ) .    now let consider if stokes visibilities",
    "can be extended to wide fields .",
    "a consequence of the three - dimensionality of @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) is , however , that the stokes parameters can not in general fully characterise the electric visibility .",
    "this is because , in contrast to @xmath42 , which has a rank of at most two due to the transversality condition ) implies that @xmath42 has rank two comes from the rank - nullity theorem of linear algebra , since equation ( [ eq : b3constr ] ) implies that dimension of the null space is one and the matrix dimension of @xmath42 is three , so @xmath138 is the rank of @xmath42 . ] , equation ( [ eq : b3constr ] ) , @xmath53 has no similar constraint .",
    "indeed one can convince oneself of the full rank of @xmath53 by considering two distinct point sources : the weighted sum of their @xmath42 matrices at some @xmath139 point according to equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) , will in general be rank three .",
    "as there are only four stokes parameters , albeit complex - valued in the case of visibilities , they can not fully parametrise a rank three matrix .",
    "alternatively , rather than use the standard four stokes parameters , one could also use complexified versions of the nine , real , generalised stokes parameters @xcite .",
    "these parameters are analogous to the standard stokes parameters but can completely describe the coherence of the full three - dimensional electric field . in light of the discussion above , these generalised stokes parameters are particularly suitable for parametrising @xmath53 , but we will not discuss them here any further .",
    "the vc - z theorem is a basic , fundamental physical relationship is independent of technology .",
    "the measurement equation ( m.e . ) of radio astronomy , on the other hand , includes practical aspects of telescope measurements , in particular the instrumental response of the telescope .",
    "usually it is a relationship between a 2@xmath522 brightness matrix and a 2@xmath522 cross - correlation matrix of the output - voltage of a dual - polarized interferometer . since in the past such two - dimensional m.e .",

    "we must first introduce a formalism for converting the full electric field to a voltage in the interferometer antenna .",
    "an electric field @xmath14 at an antenna excites an open circuit voltage @xmath132 .",
    "assuming linearity , these two quantities are related as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the antenna effective length vector . in general",
    "it is a function of incidence direction , i.e. @xmath91 , but here we will only use ideal , hertzian dipole antennas ( short electric dipoles ) .",
    "these have the important property that their effective length does not depend on incidence direction , @xmath141 is just a constant unit vector , and so it directly samples the component of the electric field along its length .",
    "if we have @xmath117 co - located antennas that have no mutual coupling , their output voltages can be written in a matrix form @xmath142 where the @xmath143-th row in the @xmath144 matrix contains the components of antenna effective length vector @xmath145 .",
    "the matrix of antenna effective lengths , denoted @xmath146 , has physical dimension length and is a @xmath117-dimensional extension of the @xmath147 matrix in ( * ? ? ? * eq .",

    "when @xmath149 and the antennas are linearly independent , then they sample the full three - dimensional electric field .",
    "such an antenna system is called _ tri - polarized _ antenna in general , and tripole antenna if the three dipoles are approximately mutually orthogonal .",
    "one can also include antennas that sample the magnetic field , and an arrangement of electric and magnetic antennas can be constructed so as to sample the full electromagnetic field at a point .",
    "such antennas are called electromagnetic vector - sensors @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will only be interested in dual- or tri - polarized antenna systems .    in particular ,",
    "let us consider a dual - polarized antenna that consists of two co - located , non - mutually coupled dipole antennas , one aligned along @xmath150 and the other along @xmath71 .",
    "the response of such a dual - polarized antenna is @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the antenna effective length .",
    "we have changed the subscripts on the voltages to reflect the right - hand side of the equation , in other words , for this dual - polarized antenna , each voltage component is directly proportional to a unique cartesian component of the electric field regardless of the radiations incidence angle .",
    "because of this property , it can be regarded as an ideal dual - polarized polarimeter element . associated with each dual - polarized antenna element",
    "is a two - dimensional plane in which the polarization is defined and measured .",
    "if this plane is the same for all of the elements in a dual - polarized interferometer or if all the planes are mutually parallel ( common design goal for polarimetric interferometers ) we will say that such an interferometer is _ plane - polarized _ , in analogy with plane - polarized waves .",
    "note that a plane - polarized interferometer is not necessarily a co - planar interferometer , and that a non - plane - polarized interferometer may be co - planar .",
    "if the plane of a plane - polarized interferometer is to be specified explicitly , we will say , e.g. in the case of equation ( [ eq : ideal2dpolmeter ] ) , that it is @xmath153-polarized .",
    "although most existing polarimetric interferometers in radio astronomy are intended to be plane - polarized , it is possible to have more general antenna elements such as electromagnetic vector - sensor arrays or electric tripole arrays .",
    "an real - life example of the latter is the lois test station , see @xcite .",
    "the prime motivation for such a tri - polarized system is that it samples the full electric field in a single telescope pointing rather than just a projection .",
    "now that we have introduced a model formalism for antenna response we can derive the 2-d m.e .",
    "for the special but important case of the @xmath153-polarized ( hertzian dipole ) interferometer , that is , the polarization plane is normal to the centre of the fov .",
    "the output voltages from the @xmath153-polarized elements located at points @xmath154 and @xmath155 are cross - correlated and the result can be expressed as the correlation matrix @xmath156 for @xmath157 , where the arguments 1 and 2 refer to baseline points @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "@xmath146 is matrix multiplied from the left and its transpose from the right with @xmath42 , but since it does not depend on @xmath91 in this case , it can be pulled out of the integral in ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) , and so the correlator output can be written @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the @xmath153-polarized antenna elements , effective length matrix .",
    "as one can see , the effect of @xmath160 is equivalent to projecting the field vectors into the @xmath153-plane and multiplying by @xmath152 . in terms of the brightness matrix",
    "the correlator output is @xmath161}}{\\sqrt{1-l^{2}-m^{2 } } }     \\,\\mathrm{d}l\\mathrm{d}m    \\label{eq : meuv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the @xmath153-projected transformation matrix @xmath162 to simplify the final result , which is now clearly two - dimensional .",
    "equation ( [ eq : meuv ] ) is a wide - field m.e .",
    "but with the novel jones matrix @xmath163 that physically represents a projection of the three - dimensional electric field vector onto the @xmath153-plane .    in the narrow fov limit @xmath164 ,",
    "so we can approximate @xmath163 in equation ( [ eq : meuv ] ) up to first order in @xmath99 and @xmath100 by the two - dimensional unity matrix , and so @xmath165 this is the basic m.e . of astronomical interferometry ,",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 14.7 ) ) .",
    "thus we have shown that the wide - field , polarimetric vc - z , equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) indeed reduces to the usual two - dimensional , jones vector based m.e . in the paraxial limit .",
    "the result , equation ( [ eq : meparaxial ] ) , depended on the particular the spherical coordinate system used as default in this paper .",
    "only this particular choice reduces directly to the standard 2-d m.e . in the paraxial limit .",
    "to see what the dual - polarized m.e .",
    "equation ( [ eq : meparaxial ] ) misses by not including the third dimension along @xmath166 , let us go back to equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) and let assume the paraxial approximation , @xmath164 . in this case @xmath167 where we have kept only terms of first order in @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath168 in equation ( [ eq : vcz3d ] ) is identical to @xmath169 in equation ( [ eq : meparaxial ] ) for @xmath170 , but for the @xmath166 components , @xmath171 and @xmath172 so the @xmath173 component of the three - dimensional visibility matrix does not provide anything , but the @xmath174 ( and @xmath175 ) and the @xmath176 ( and @xmath177 ) components do .",
    "thus even for a narrow fov , a dual - polarized interferometer does not measure the full set of generally non - zero electric visibilities .",
    "note that if the antenna array is not exactly plane - polarized , these additional visibility components will contribute to the output - voltage of such an array .",
    "this leads to the important question of how serious the loss of visibility information is in a dual - polarized interferometer .",
    "more specifically , we ask whether a plane - polarized interferometer , given by some @xmath178 matrix @xmath146 , can in general perform full polarimetry of an arbitrary source distribution .",
    "the answer is that the source brightness matrix in some direction can be determined fully only if @xmath179 since in this case @xmath180 is invertible .",
    "for the special but important case @xmath181 this condition is equivalent to @xmath182 thus , an @xmath153-polarized interferometer can recover the full polarimetry except on the great circle orthogonal to @xmath7 , which we may call the imaging horizon .",
    "so , in wide - field imaging with @xmath153-polarized interferometers the image horizon can not be measured with a single telescope pointing .",
    "under noise - free conditions , this would pose little problem , but if we add in the effects of noise then the great circle of directions for which full polarimetry is not feasible broadens as a function of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "although the discussion above was mainly focused on plane - polarized interferometers , the three - dimensional formalism developed here can also be applied to more general dual - polarized interferometers .",
    "in particular it can model the situation when the polarization planes of dual - polarized antennas in an array are not all parallel .",
    "since several large arrays of dual - polarized antenna based interferometers are currently being planned for , this would address the important question of whether such arrays should strive to be plane - polarized or whether they should purposely not be plane - polarized to minimize the inversion problems mentioned above .",
    "we now show that the m.e . for the @xmath153-polarized , hertzian dipole interferometer , equation ( [ eq : meuv ] ) ,",
    "exhibits distortions that depend on the look - direction , that is , the images based on these brightnesses contain polarization aberrations @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the general understanding in observational radio astronomy that the polarimetry of a telescope is worse off - axis than on - axis .",
    "say we have measured the @xmath37 correlation matrix @xmath183 .",
    "we can not use the formal solution ( [ eq : vcz3dinv ] ) directly since it is for the 3@xmath523 visibility , and it is not clear how to obtain the remaining , unmeasured @xmath166 components from the @xmath184 and @xmath185 components of @xmath186 . on the other hand , for the scalar case , the formal solution for producing a synthesized image is the following scalar , wide - field imaging equation : @xmath187 }     \\mathrm{d}u\\mathrm{d}v\\mathrm{d}w\\mathrm{d}n ,    \\label{eq : sclwfimage}\\ ] ] where @xmath188 is the scalar brightness and @xmath189 is the scalar visibility , see equation ( 13 ) in @xcite who call it the 3d method of synthesis imaging .",
    "let us apply ( [ eq : sclwfimage ] ) to each component of @xmath186 as if it were a scalar , thus creating a matrix analogue of the scalar , wide - field imaging equation .",
    "the resulting brightness matrix @xmath190 ( polarized image ) is @xmath191 }     \\mathrm{d}u\\mathrm{d}v\\mathrm{d}w\\mathrm{d}n .",
    "\\label{eq : image2d}\\ ] ] however , this is not the true brightness matrix because we see from equation ( [ eq : meuv ] ) that @xmath192 it follows that @xmath190 is actually the projection of the three - dimensional brightness matrix into the @xmath153-plane .",
    "the stokes @xmath153-projected brightnesses @xmath193 are based directly on @xmath190 in analogy with equation ( [ eq : stokesbright ] ) , that is , @xmath194 the relationship between these stokes brightnesses and the true stokes brightnesses @xmath195 , which are based on @xmath93 can found by recasting equation ( [ eq : briprojrel ] ) as @xmath196 where @xmath197 @xmath198 is a mueller matrix that quantifies the distortion of true stokes brightnesses based on the imaging equation ( [ eq : image2d ] ) .    for a very narrow fov , @xmath199 and",
    "@xmath198 is approximately unity . in general , however , @xmath198 is not the unit matrix with the effect that the perceived stokes vector is a distortion of the true stokes vector .",
    "thus , without further processing a plane - polarized interferometer of short dipoles will exhibit polarization aberrations over wide fields .",
    "by contrast , a tripole array interferometer is , at least in theory , polarimetrically aberration - free over a wide field , since the scalar wide - field imaging equation ( [ eq : sclwfimage ] ) applied to the components of its visibility matrix as if they were scalars gives @xmath42 , which can be interpreted as the exact @xmath93 in cartesian ( rather than spherical ) components .    examples of these wide - field distortions are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : poldist4by4 ] .",
    "it shows aberration effects for source distributions that are constant over the entire hemisphere , by which we mean that @xmath200 , so the brightnesses do not explicitly vary with direction . ] .",
    "fortunately , these distortions can be compensated for in the image plane since @xmath198 is invertible and well - conditioned as long as @xmath201 is not close to one .",
    "distortion of various polarized source distributions across the hemisphere for an @xmath153-polarized interferometer .",
    "all distributions are such that the stokes brightnesses are constant , that is , they do not vary explicitly with direction although they may vary implicitly due to variation of the reference system for the stokes brightnesses , @xmath66 and @xmath68 , with direction .",
    "the plots are of the polarization ellipses corresponding to the normalized stokes parameters @xmath202 , where @xmath203 are the @xmath153-projected stokes brightnesses as a function of the direction @xmath91 .",
    "the plots clearly show polarization aberration , that is , a direction dependent distortion in the observed polarization .",
    "the source distributions state of polarization ( shown in red ) can be seen at the centre of the fov , @xmath204 , where there is no distortion .",
    "the upper - left panel shows @xmath205 , i.e. completely unpolarized radiation , the upper - right panel shows circularly polarized radiation , the lower - left shows radiation linearly polarized along @xmath66 , @xmath206 , and the lower - right panel is for radiation linearly polarized along @xmath68 , @xmath207 . ]    another aspect of equation ( [ eq : stokespdist ] ) that is important , is that it shows , not surprisingly , that partially polarized , wide fields can not be treated as scalar , wide fields .",
    "in fact , even for the supposedly ` scalar ' case , that is , when we only consider the scalar visibility @xmath208 of an unpolarized source distribution , so @xmath209 , equations ( [ eq : stokespdist ] ) and ( [ eq : image2d ] ) imply that @xmath210 where @xmath211 stands for two - dimensional fourier transform .",
    "this should be compared with @xmath212 for the isotropic , scalar antenna case ( see , e.g. , equation ( 1 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "this expression differs even for narrow fields since , to lowest , non - vanishing order in @xmath99 and @xmath100 , equation ( [ eq : myscalarvcz ] ) becomes approximately @xmath213 , \\ ] ] while @xmath214 for the isotropic , scalar antenna case .",
    "thus short dipoles are less aberrated than isotropic , scalar antennas .",
    "the conclusion here , that scalar theory is not sufficient for the description of the general vc - z relations , agrees with those detailed in the field of optical coherence , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "also , equation ( [ eq : myscalarvcz ] ) corresponds to an analogous equation in @xcite .",
    "consider an unpolarized point source at @xmath215 , so @xmath216 , and express @xmath217 as @xmath218 ( where @xmath219 is the angle between the point source position and @xmath7 , and is equivalent to @xmath220 in @xcite ) , then the intensity of the unpolarized point source , as measured by single - pixel telescope , is @xmath221 .",
    "this corresponds to equation ( 47 ) in @xcite .",
    "although the results will be different for other types of antennas , the hertzian dipole is an important special case as it is the simplest polarimetric antenna and they are directly proportional to the cartesian coordinates of the electric visibility matrix .",
    "the ultimate reason for the aberration is of course that the incident , transverse field is being projected onto the polarization plane of the hertzian dipoles thereby distorting the field . indeed",
    "this projection is identical to the orthographic projection of a hemisphere in cartography . in comparison to other effects encountered in instrumental calibration , such as beam - shape",
    ", these effects may seem small .",
    "they are , however , important in that they determine the ultimate limits of polarimetry since these effects are of a intrinsic , geometric nature .",
    "inspection of @xmath198 reveals that around @xmath204 the aberrations are @xmath222 . in the case of the aperture array of the ska",
    ", the preliminary specification @xcite has a mean fov of 250 square degrees , so the aberration error is in the order of ~2% , or -16 db , at the edge of the fov .",
    "this should be compared with the requirements from the key scientific projects that in some cases call for -30 db in polarization purity over wide fields .",
    "thus , these polarization aberrations will need to be considered in wide - field imaging with ska .",
    "it is not difficult to show that these polarization aberrations occurring at the edges of wide - field images also occur for off - axis imaging with fixed mount telescopes .",
    "this occurs , for instance , in phased arrays of crossed dipoles such as lofar and the low frequency part of ska , where imaging at scan angles away from boresight ( zenith ) will be achieved by electronically steering the beam - form .",
    "since the crossed dipoles are fixed to the ground and are not on a mechanically rotating mount , a situation geometrically analogous to the wide - field imaging consider above occurs .",
    "this leads to similar aberrations in polarization for short electric dipole arrays .",
    "scan angles of 45@xmath223 have been proposed for which the aberrations will of the order of -3 db .",
    "we have derived the full set of electromagnetic vc - z relations , which are the basis of radio astronomical interferometry , without invoking the paraxial approximation .",
    "these relations allow all - sky imaging in a single telescope pointing .",
    "we have achieved these relations by generalising the usual 2-d cartesian jones vector based m.e . to a 3-d wolf coherence matrix formulation on the ( celestial ) sphere .",
    "the derived wide - field vc - z relations are not simply trivial matrix ( or vector ) analogues of the wide - field , scalar vc - z , they exhibit direction dependent polarimetric effects . indeed even in the scalar limit ( that is , unpolarized radiation ) , our m.e . is not the same as the m.e . derived from scalar theory , in the case of hertzian dipoles .",
    "furthermore , we found that , for an arbitrary wide - field of sources , the electric visibilities generally have nine complex components for an arbitrary baseline .",
    "this implies that the standard stokes ( cartesian ) visibilities do not provide a full description of electric coherence for wide fields .",
    "we have also shown that our vc - z relation ( for the electric field ) reduces to the standard 2-d m.e .",
    "after a 2-d projection .",
    "we showed that a consequence of this projection is that plane - polarized , hertzian dipole interferometers are aberrated polarimetrically .",
    "fortunately , these aberrations can be corrected for in the image plane for sources sufficiently far away from the plane of the dual - polarized antenna elements .    besides its use in the derivation of the wide - field vc - z relation",
    ", we believe that the 3-d wolf formalism can be useful in constructing more general 3-d m.e . in cases requiring the full set of electric components . as examples ,",
    "we mention the modelling of tri - polarized element arrays , the modelling of dual - polarized element arrays that are not strictly plane - polarized ( due to manufacturing errors or the earth s curvature ) , and the modelling of propagation that is not along the line - of - sight ( due to refraction or diffraction in the ionosphere , e.g. ) .",

    "<S> we find , however , that such dual - polarized interferometers can have polarimetric aberrations at the edges of the fov that are often correctable . </S>",
    "<S> our theorem is particularly relevant to proposed and recently developed wide fov interferometers such as lofar and ska , for which direction - dependent effects will be important .    </S>",
