    "to our best knowledge , it hasnt been studied so far what can be said about the relation between the domains of normality of a family @xmath0 of meromorphic functions , its conjugate family and the corresponding schwarzian derivative ( sd for short ) family . the aim of the present paper is to tackle these questions . we also establish a criterion for the sd family of a family @xmath0 of analytic functions on a domain @xmath9 to be a normal family .    for a meromorphic function @xmath10 on @xmath11 ,",
    "its sd is defined by @xmath12 which has the invariance property @xmath13 for every mobius transformation @xmath14 it is well known @xcite @xmath15 if and only if @xmath10 is a mobius transformation .",
    "also if @xmath10 is a meromorphic function on @xmath11 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 then @xmath18 we show this fact is true even if the meromorphic function @xmath10 omits a finite value . for meromorphic functions @xmath10 and @xmath19 for which the composition @xmath20 is defined , @xmath21 holds .",
    "as @xmath22 for each mobius transformation @xmath23    recently , steinmetz @xcite gave a completely different proof of a normality criterion involving spherical derivatives given by grahl and nevo @xcite .",
    "the proof was based on a property equivalent to @xmath24 which is again equivalent to the fact that corresponding sd is holomorphic on the given domain .",

    "@xmath43 is equivalent to local univalence of the function @xmath44 as the derivative of a locally bounded family of analytic functions is locally bounded ( see @xcite ) , therefore the families @xmath45 and @xmath46 are locally bounded . for @xmath47 and using the local boundedness of the families @xmath45 and @xmath48 one obtains the sd family is locally bounded on @xmath1 and so is normal on @xmath1 by montel s theorem .",
    "we wanted to analyse the relation between the domains of normality of a family @xmath53 of meromorphic functions on the complex plane @xmath11 and that of its sd family .",
    "we observe as such no correlation between them and tried to substantiate this through multiple examples . in all the subsequent examples to follow",
    "the domain of the family of meromorphic functions under consideration is the complex plane @xmath54            under some condition on the family @xmath0 of meromorphic functions , we show its domain of normality is contained in the domain of normality of the corresponding sd family .",
