    "this paper offers a systematic way to answer the question : how much change must occur in a solution of equations to compensate for perturbations to the equations ?",
    "short of finding all the nearby roots of the new equations , the minimal change can be determined in an asymptotic sense by linearizing the equations and considering the dual problems .",
