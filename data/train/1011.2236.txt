    "motion of a charged particle in an inhomogeneous electromagnetic field can be described by a hamiltonian nonlinear system , which can not be solved analytically in a general case @xcite .",
    "in such a system various resonant effects take a place @xcite , and some of them can by described using the adiabatic approach . in particular , a charged particle in the field of an electromagnetic ( or electrostatic ) wave and a background magnetic field can be trapped in the potential well of the wave and accelerated along the wave front .",
    "this phenomenon is called a surfatron acceleration .",
    "the mechanism of the surfatron acceleration of charged particles is often considered for description of various plasma - physics phenomena @xcite . originally this mechanism was suggested for description of charged particles acceleration along the front of a shock wave @xcite and this application is still actual @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are various astrophysical applications of the surfatron acceleration mechanism to problems of generation of high energy particles @xcite and consequent radiation @xcite .",
    "surfatron acceleration of relativistic particles was considered , for example , in @xcite . in all these papers",
    "authors consider a particle interaction with an electrostatic wave .",
    "surfatron acceleration of a particle by an electromagnetic wave is less studied .",
    "the analytical theory was constructed only for nonrelativistic @xcite or ultrarelativistic @xcite particles .",
    "the effect of large particle velocity was estimated numerically in @xcite .",
    "also , numerical calculations were carried out for the case when the wave amplitude is small compared to the background magnetic field @xcite ; in this case , the particle is accelerated by multiple scatterings on the wave .",
    "in addition , several laboratory experiments with relativistic particles and large wave amplitudes were carried out for the investigation of surfatron acceleration of charged particles by electromagnetic waves ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , a complete analytic theory of relativistic charged particle captures by electromagnetic waves and the resulting acceleration is important .",
    "particle capture and surfatron acceleration is possible if phase velocity of the wave is smaller than the absolute value of the particle velocity ( and hence , smaller than the speed of light ) . in this case",
    "the projection of particle velocity onto the wave vector direction can become equal to value of the phase velocity of the wave and the resonance takes a place .",
    "there are several plasma modes that can support a wave with needed properties : the magnetosonic wave with frequency close to lower - hybrid @xcite , the plasma wave with frequency close to higher - hybrid @xcite or various drift modes of plasma instability @xcite .",
    "in addition , a relatively small population of trapped particles can decrease the phase velocity of a wave @xcite and establish the condition of resonance interaction .",
    "a secondary effect of surfatron acceleration is the radiation of accelerated particles due to the oscillatory component of their motion @xcite .",
    "a captured particle accelerates along the wave front , and at the same time it oscillates near the minimum of the wave potential well . due to these oscillations",
    "the particle can radiate .",
    "estimates of this radiation were carried out in the case of an electrostatic wave .",
    "the question of particle radiation in the system with electromagnetic wave is discussed in our paper .",
    "we study the problem of interaction of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field with an electromagnetic wave using the theory of resonant phenomena .",
    "the study of slow passages of a hamiltonian system through a nonlinear resonance was started in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the theory of resonant processes in hamiltonian systems with slow and fast motions in the form developed in @xcite ( see @xcite for references to preceding works ) .",
    "the description of scattering on resonances and captures into resonances plays a central role in this theory .",
    "resonant phenomena arise in a variety of problems of physics , including hydrodynamics , celestial mechanics , and plasma physics . for several examples of resonant phenomena ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we consider motion of a relativistic charged particle of mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 in a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 and the field of a plane linearly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating in perpendicular direction to @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in the cartesian coordinates @xmath4 the resulting magnetic field components are @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the amplitude of the magnetic field of the wave , @xmath7 is the magnitude of the wave vector directed along the @xmath8-axis , and @xmath9 is the wave frequency .",
    "the corresponding vector potential can be chosen as = ( 0 , b_0 q_1 + ( kq_1 - t ) , 0 ) . [ 2.1 ] let @xmath10 be components of the particle s momentum . introduce _ 2 = p_2 + b_0 q_1 + ( k q_1 - t ) .",

    "thus canonically conjugate momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants of motion .",

    "introduce larmor frequency @xmath18 and dimensionless parameter @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is small : @xmath21 .",
    "use the following rescaling to make the system dimensionless : p_i = , q_i = , + t = , h = , + k = , = .",

    "variable @xmath27 is an integral of motion of the averaged system ( see ( [ 2.6 ] ) ) and thus an adiabatic invariant of the exact system .",

    "to study the system near the resonance , we apply the approach formulated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "one can see that variables @xmath60 are fast , and variables @xmath44 are slow .",

    "one can see that both integration limits and the expression in square brackets in ( [ 3.8 ] ) do not depend on @xmath64 .",
    "thus , s = a = a , [ 3.9 ] where @xmath78 is a constant independent of @xmath64 ( and @xmath63 ) .",
    "now take into account slow variation of @xmath63 and @xmath64 according to the first two equations in ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "it follows from the expression ( [ 3.2 ] ) for @xmath79 that if @xmath80 , variable @xmath64 grows with time .",
    "this means that area @xmath72 also grows in the process of motion .",
    "therefore , phase points on the phase portrait of the fast subsystem can cross the separatrix and enter the domain of oscillations .",
    "this corresponds to a capture into resonance .",
    "the area @xmath81 encircled by a trajectory in the domain of oscillations on this portrait is an adiabatic invariant ( it is called the _ inner adiabatic invariant _ ) .",
    "thus , as @xmath72 monotonously grows with time , a captured particle goes deeper and deeper inside the oscillation domain and can not leave it .",
    "this means that a particle captured into the resonance is captured forever .    [",

    "it moves with the _ resonant flow _ defined by hamiltonian @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are : p = -= q , + q = = v_. [ 3.10 ] it means that a captured particle moves in @xmath8-direction with the wave at a speed of the wave s phase velocity .",
    "it follows from ( [ 2.1a ] ) and the fact that @xmath17 that @xmath82 , and , hence @xmath83 .",
    "therefore @xmath84-component of the particle s momentum varies ( on average ) linearly in time : @xmath85    thus , the particle is accelerated along the wave front .",
    "this acceleration is called surfatron one . to find variation of @xmath86 in this motion",
    ", we use that @xmath87 and expression ( [ 2.8a ] ) for @xmath27 on the resonant surface .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath88 and p_1 = , [ 3.11 ] where we used the second equation in ( [ 3.10 ] ) . at @xmath89",
    "we find that @xmath86 grows with time as @xmath90 .",
    "in dimensional variables , we find that @xmath91 for the energy of a captured particle @xmath92 we find that it also grows linearly with time at large enough values of @xmath64 .",

    "the captured particle also oscillates in the potential well of the wave .",
    "these oscillations correspond to motion in the oscillatory domain in fig",
    ". one can evaluate the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations using conservation of the inner adiabatic invariant @xmath81 . for a captured particle",
    "@xmath81 equals the area inside the separatrix _ at the time when the particle crossed the separatrix_. it follows from the expression for @xmath65 in ( [ 3.6 ] ) that for a captured particle j = _ _ 1^_2 , [ 3.12 ] where @xmath95 does not depend on @xmath28 ; @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the minimal and the maximal values of @xmath28 on a trajectory with fixed values of @xmath65 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus , growth of @xmath64 results in decreasing of the amplitude of the @xmath28-oscillations .",
    "when the amplitude of these oscillations is sufficiently small , one can expand the hamiltonian @xmath65 to obtain @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are values of @xmath65 and @xmath28 at the bottom of the potential well inside the separatrix ( see fig .",
    "the frequency of oscillations ( in terms of rescaled time @xmath62 ) is approximately @xmath101 , and in this approximation @xmath102 . when the particle is captured , @xmath103 .",
    "using conservation of @xmath81 along the trajectory of the captured particle , one obtains the scalings @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are amplitudes of @xmath28-oscillations and @xmath108-oscillations accordingly .",

    "accordingly , amplitude of oscillations in @xmath111 decreases with time as @xmath109 .",
    "in dimensional variables we have @xmath112 and @xmath113 . the frequency of these oscillations is @xmath114 ( we recall that we made time rescaling to obtain ( [ 3.6 ] ) ) . thus , _ 0 k(1-v_^2 ) . [",

    "its probability is a small value of order @xmath121 . however",
    ", the geometry of the system makes the particle pass through the resonance repeatedly , at each larmor turn .",
    "the probability of capture after @xmath122 larmor turns is a value of order one ( provided that @xmath66 ) .    for comparison with theoretical results we present the numerical solution of the system with hamiltonian ( [ 2.3 ] ) , parameters @xmath123 , @xmath124 and initial value of the @xmath125 . the particle trajectory in momentum space @xmath126 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at the first stage of modelling the particle",
    "rotates in the constant background magnetic field ( larmor rotation ) .",
    "this motion is slightly perturbed by influence of the wave : the larmor circles in @xmath126 plane are `` scattered '' . then after certain time interval the particle is captured by the wave and the magnitude of momentum @xmath111 grows with time while momentum @xmath86 oscillates around the resonant value ( it is also increasing , yet much slower ) . to compare the scale of growth of momenta @xmath86 and @xmath111 we plot the same picture on a longer time range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath86 and @xmath111 after initial time interval is @xmath127 , in agreement with the theory ( see equation ( [ 3.11 ] ) ) .",
    "the particle energy @xmath128 is shown in fig .",
    "the energy is almost constant before capture ( if we neglect small scatterings due to wave impacts ) and after the capture the energy grows linearly with time .",
    "in addition we examine the theoretical equation for frequency of oscillation of the captured particle - equation ( [ 3.13 ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we plot the oscillation frequency of @xmath129 around the null value - fig .",
    "capture into the resonance is impossible in the case @xmath130 , when there is no oscillatory domain on the phase portrait of the pendulum - like system ( see fig .",
    "however , in this case the particle energy also changes at the resonance crossing .",
    "this happens due to scatterings on the resonance .",
    "if @xmath130 , the average value of the jump in the energy is zero ( see @xcite ) , but the dispersion is non - zero , and thus diffusive variation of the particle energy may be possible .",
    "here we study this topic more attentively .    when the particle is far from the resonance , its energy is approximately constant , because the impact of the wave can be averaged .",
    "thus , to study variation of the particle energy we find its time derivative according to equations of motion ( [ 3.7 ] ) and integrate it near the resonance .",
    "we have e= = . [ 4.1 ] using ( [ 2.4 ] ) we can write e = ( + i ) = i = - .",
    "[ 4.2 ] from ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) we find that near the resonance e = d , [ 4.3 ] to integrate ( [ 4.3 ] ) we change the integration variable from time @xmath131 to phase @xmath28 according to @xmath132 .",
    "thus we find for variation ( jump ) of the particle energy on one resonance crossing j_e = 2 _ -^ _ * , [ 4.4 ] where @xmath133 is the wave s phase at the resonance crossing , and @xmath64 is taken also at the crossing of the unperturbed trajectory with energy @xmath134 and the resonant surface .",
    "the value of @xmath133 strongly depends on initial conditions and should be treated as random .",
    "therefore , change in the particle s energy on the resonance is also a random variable . if there is no separatrix on the phase portrait in fig . 1 ( i.e. , if @xmath130 )",
    ", the average value of this latter random value is zero .",
    "an important question is whether these values at successive crossings are statistically independent . expressing @xmath64 in ( [ 4.4 ] ) on the resonance via @xmath134 ( we use that at the resonance @xmath135 ) we find that at @xmath136 the variation of energy at the resonance scattering is a value of order j_e ~. [ 4.5 ]    on the plane @xmath137 unperturbed motion of the particle is rotation along the circle @xmath138 . using hamiltonian equations of the unperturbed motion",
    ", one immediately finds that the frequency of this rotation is @xmath139 .",
    "the resonant curve on the plane @xmath137 is a branch of hyperbola @xmath140 with @xmath141 . at large enough values of @xmath134 the trajectory of the unperturbed motion crosses the resonant curve at two points .",
    "it is straightforward to find that the time of motion between these two points is a value of order @xmath142 .",
    "consider two successive resonance crossings .",
    "let the values of @xmath28 at the first and the second crossings be @xmath143 and @xmath144 accordingly . to find @xmath145 one can integrate equation of motion for @xmath28 in ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "thus , one obtains @xmath146 .",
    "a small variation @xmath147 of the phase @xmath143 results in variation of the energy jump @xmath148 at the first resonance crossing .",
    "the resulting variation @xmath149 of the phase at the second crossing can be found as @xmath150 .",
    "thus , the resulting variation in the phase at the second resonance crossing is much larger than @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the values of phase at successive resonance crossings are statistically independent .",
    "hence , the jumps in the particle s energy at the resonance produce diffusive variation of the energy and its unlimited stochastic growth .",
    "note , that in @xcite the diffusive growth of energy was studied in nonrelativistic case .",
    "it was found that , unlike in the relativistic case , for a nonrelativistic particle the energy diffusion slows down and finally stops at large enough energies .",
    "one can estimate the rate of the energy diffusion as follows . consider a long trajectory that crosses the resonance @xmath151 times .",
    "introduce new variable @xmath152 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 4.5 ] ) that at every resonant crossing @xmath153 changes by a value of order @xmath121 .",
    "if successive jumps in energy are not correlated , it follows from ( [ 4.5 ] ) that typical displacement of @xmath153 after @xmath154 resonance crossings is @xmath155 .",
    "hence , typical value of energy after @xmath154 jumps is proportional to @xmath154 : e ~n . [ 4.6 ] time interval between successive jumps is a value of order of the larmor period .",
    "hence , the time interval corresponding to @xmath154 resonance crossings is @xmath156 . combining this with ( [ 4.6 ] )",
    ", we find that the energy typically grows with time as e ~. [ 4.7 ] we also obtain that the number of jumps ( resonance crossings ) grows with time as @xmath157 .    these results on the energy diffusion of a relativistic particle can be examined numerically . for this purpose",
    "we construct the poincar section of a particle trajectory in @xmath126 plane .",
    "points on this plane are plotted with time period @xmath158 .",
    "one can see that the diffusion in @xmath126 space become stronger as the initial energy of particles grows ( fig .",
