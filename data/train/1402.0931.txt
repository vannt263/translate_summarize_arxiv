    "the idea of protected ground state degeneracies in condensed matter systems has attracted much interest recently . it is proposed that in a @xmath0-wave superconductor where both spin and particle - hole degeneracy are absent , a zero - energy state called the majorana bound state can appear .",
    "this elusive quasiparticle obeys non - abelian statistics @xcite , and thus could serve as a qubit building block for topological quantum computation @xcite . while @xmath0-wave superconductors are rare , nanotechnology opens the possibility to design this unconventional superconducting state using suitable combinations of materials .    with these prospects in mind ,",
    "the hunt for majorana bound states is stronger than ever , and there is much experimental activity to realize proposed schemes that contain these particles .",
    "recent work includes superconductor - topological insulator systems @xcite and semiconductor nanowires in the presence of a strong zeeman and rashba spin orbit field @xcite or a quantum dot system @xcite .",
    "experiments demonstrating zero bias conductance peaks in nanowire systems @xcite , and supercurrents @xcite , fraunhofer patterns and shapiro steps @xcite , and squids @xcite in superconductor - topological insulator devices are steps towards the definitive detection of a majorana bound state .",
    "more recent experiments @xcite have provided even stronger evidence for majoranas in fabricated iron atomic chains on superconducting lead , however no evidence of braiding has yet been demonstrated .",
    "are sufficient for the realization of majorana bound states .",
    "the superconducting leads form a loop , as in a rf squid geometry , which allows to perform a current - phase relationship measurement .",
    "the possible trajectories in the junction that determine the total supercurrent are shown in the upper left .",
    "axes are defined in the bottom - left corner for future use.,width=321 ]    superconductor - quantum dot devices have several advantages over other proposed systems to support majorana bound states .",
    "these systems can be lithographically defined , are strongly gate tunable and are readily operated in the few electron regime .",
    "the superconducting proximity effect is also gate tunable , which allows the stringent conditions for the presence of majorana bound states to be satisfied .",
    "unfortunately , majorana bound states in the single particle formalism rely on a strong zeeman field in combination with strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite ( or a strong magnetic field gradient between the dots mimicking the spin - orbit coupling @xcite ) , making the experimental realization a serious challenge .",
    "specifically , the zeeman splitting biases towards the spin - polarised kitaev state @xcite , while the induced @xmath1-wave superconducting gap @xmath2 biases against this state .",
    "this then requires that the zeeman splitting is large enough , so that the bias towards the kitaev state dominates .",
    "recent results @xcite suggest the possibility of braiding kramers pairs of majorana bound states .",
    "this relaxes the requirement for time - reversal symmetry breaking , but requires protection from perturbations that mix these pairs instead .",
    "fortunately , these requirements can be strongly relaxed as shown recently by wright and veldhorst @xcite , who considered the effect of strong correlations for the engineering of majorana bound states .",
    "they demonstrated that only vanishingly small anisotropic zeeman splitting , @xmath3 , is required .",
    "the resulting majorana bound states are described in the many - particle formalism , and although not strictly localized , they have the property of a relaxed form of localization .",
    "specifically , the operator corresponding to a majorana bound state is localized to a single site with respect to single creation or annihilation operator terms , but is necessarily non - local with respect to number operator terms . since number operators do not gain a phase during braiding operations , the majorana bound states retain a local relative phase , which is responsible for their non - abelian behaviour .",
    "these results open new perspectives for the realization of majorana bound states .",
    "therefore , a rigorous derivation of how the majorana bound states behave in transport measurements and in the presence of magnetic fields is highly valuable .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the superconductor - double quantum dot system in detail , and in particular the regions where majorana bound states are predicted to appear .",
    "we start by considering two quantum dots proximity coupled to superconducting leads in the presence of an anisotropic magnetic field and derive an effective hamiltonian .",
    "we investigate thoroughly the form of the excitation operators at a degeneracy point , and present concrete arguments for their being majorana bound states .",
    "this discussion is based on the many - particle requirements for a majorana bound state , and the existence of a continuous transition between this system and kitaev s ground - breaking model .",
    "finally , we investigate the josephson supercurrent that may provide experimental evidence for majorana bound states in these systems .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] shows a schematic design of the considered system .",
    "a josephson junction is realized by connecting a double quantum dot on both sides to a superconducting lead .",
    "two magnetic fields are present ; a local magnetic field produced by the stray fields of the nanomagnet together with an external field from another source .",
    "together , these determine the zeeman splitting @xmath4 in the dots and define the spin quantization axis , as well as determining the flux @xmath5 through the quantum dot josephson junction and the flux @xmath6 through the superconducting ring .",
    "anisotropy in the local magnetic field due to the position and strength of the nanomagnet allows for a nonzero angle @xmath7 between the spin axis of the quantum dots . we will show that majorana bound states appear in small magnetic fields , @xmath8 , and for any non - zero @xmath7 .",
    "an important measure of the system is the supercurrent that can flow through the quantum dots via the superconducting proximity effect .",
    "this supercurrent is dependent on the flux @xmath5 through the junction , and the superconducting phase difference @xmath9 .",
    "the superconducting phase @xmath10 can be tuned via the flux @xmath6 through the loop of the superconducting leads .",
    "this layout is similar in design to an rf squid consisting of a josephson junction , and has often been used to measure the current phase relation ( cpr ) . since the protection of the majorana bound states in this system is via parity conservation , this arrangement of a closed loop without macroscopic leads to the outside world should minimize quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "the possible trajectories of quasiparticles in the system that determine the supercurrent through the junction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "a cooper pair can tunnel from the superconducting lead to a quantum dot via andreev reflection ( ar ) or split over the two quantum dots via crossed andreev reflection ( car ) .",
    "quasiparticle tunneling between the quantum dots , via the superconducting leads , is called elastic co - tunneling ( ec ) .",
    "interestingly , car is unaffected by the magnetic field through the junction , such that the supercurrent dependence on @xmath5 is determined by ar and ec .",
    "the superconducting phase difference @xmath10 controlled by @xmath6 , however , only affects ar and car , but not ec .",
    "we will show that these dependencies lead to novel current - phase relationships and results in a strong flexibility to realize majorana bound states .",
    "the requirement for only small zeeman splitting gives several advantages over other quantum dot majorana bound state proposals .",
    "firstly , it opens a wider range of suitable materials .",
    "experimentally , supercurrents through quantum dots formed in carbon nanotubes@xcite , inas nanowires @xcite , inas quantum dots @xcite , and graphene @xcite have been observed , making them potential candidates to observed the many - particle majorana bound states .",
    "secondly , the experimental conditions are strongly relaxed , since the conditions where majorana modes arise and cpr measurements are greatly simplified .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] is given by    @xmath11    we will describe each term in turn .",
    "the superconducting loop is modelled as a linear chain with chemical potential @xmath12 , hopping strength @xmath13 , and superconducting order parameter @xmath14 .",
    "note that whilst the magnitude @xmath15 is expected to be constant throughout the superconductor , the superconducting phase @xmath16 will change as we wind about the magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "we write    @xmath17    here , @xmath18 denotes pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "we will ultimately only be concerned with the phases on the ends of the superconductors - let us label these @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "importantly , the phase difference @xmath10 can be tuned to a high degree of accuracy by adjusting @xmath6 .",
    "the dots ( @xmath22 ) have an on - site potential @xmath23 , and are considered in the presence of a small ( but non - zero ) magnetic field , leading to a zeeman energy splitting @xmath4    @xmath24    we consider the quantum dots to be operated in the few electron regime , where a strong coulombic repulsion is present between two electrons on the same dot .",
    "we model this as a hubbard - style interaction    @xmath25    the two superconductors are coupled to the dots via the proximity effect , which allows for electron tunneling between either end of the superconductor and either dot :    @xmath26 we assume that the tunnel coupling @xmath27 of the two dots have the same amplitude @xmath28 , and study the effect of finite phase difference . in practice this phase difference is realized by the magnetic flux through the quantum dot josephson junction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . in the peierls substitution ,",
    "the tunneling obtains a phase proportional to the size of the field    @xmath29    here , @xmath30 is the magnetic flux quantum , and we integrate along lines between the superconductors and the dots ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "this is a slight simplification , as the electrons do not strictly travel along any given line , but the result is essentially the same .",
    "choosing the gauge @xmath31 ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] for axis ) , we calculate    @xmath32    where @xmath5 is the enclosed flux , and the positive sign is taken when the path travels anticlockwise about the origin .    as all terms in the hamiltonian involving the superconductors",
    "are quadratic , they may be removed to write down an effective hamiltonian for the dots via an integration over grassman variables @xcite . to do this ,",
    "we write down the partition function of the system    @xmath33\\exp(-s[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]),\\label{partitionfunction}\\\\ s[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]&=\\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau\\left[\\bar{\\psi}\\partial_{\\tau}\\psi+{\\mathcal{h}}[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the functional form of the hamiltonian . here ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are vectors of grassman variables , which are the eigenvalues of the annihilation operators for some fermionic coherent state @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we use the following notation to separate the grassman variables associated with the dots from those associated with the superconductor ,    @xmath38    then we can define    @xmath39    here @xmath40(@xmath41 ) contains the @xmath42(@xmath43 ) terms , and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) contains their adjoints , which are defined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 . as we are dealing with a superconducting system ,",
    "it is necessary to use an electron - hole nambu basis , and include the adjoint variables @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) in the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) vector ( which doubles in size ) .",
    "we can then expand @xmath50 $ ] into the terms from equation [ eqn : hamoverview ] , replacing @xmath35 with either @xmath40 or @xmath41 depending on which species is being considered .",
    "furthermore , quadratic hamiltonian terms can be rewritten as matrix products , for example @xmath51\\rightarrow \\bar{\\psi}h_d\\psi$ ] . in this notation ,",
    "our action becomes @xmath52&=\\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau\\left[\\bar{\\psi}\\partial_{\\tau}\\psi+{\\mathcal{h}}_u[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]+\\bar{\\psi}h_d\\psi\\right.\\nonumber\\\\&\\left.+\\bar{\\phi}{\\mathcal{g}}^{-1}\\phi+\\bar{\\psi}m\\phi+\\bar{\\phi}m^{\\dag}\\psi\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eqn : effaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , we have defined @xmath53 , and split the terms from @xmath54 into @xmath55 , which contains the information on tunneling from the superconductors to the dot , and its adjoint @xmath56 . note that we are treating each grassman variable as independent from its corresponding adjoint .",
    "we now shift all @xmath41 dependence to a single term by completing the square    @xmath52&=\\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau\\left[\\bar{\\psi}\\partial_{\\tau}\\psi+{\\mathcal{h}}_u[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]+\\bar{\\psi}h_d\\psi\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left.+(\\bar{\\phi}{\\mathcal{g}}^{-1}+\\bar{\\psi}m){\\mathcal{g}}({\\mathcal{g}}^{-1}\\phi+ m^{\\dag}\\psi)-\\bar{\\psi}m{\\mathcal{g}}m^{\\dag}\\psi\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the term containing the @xmath41 dependence may be integrated out to give a constant @xcite .",
    "our effective hamiltonian then consists of the original @xmath22 and @xmath57 terms , and a new term which was the remainder from completing the square    @xmath58=-\\bar{\\psi}m{\\mathcal{g}}m^{\\dag}\\psi.\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     @xmath59    we see that this is the superconducting wire model of kitaev for two sites .",
    "this system will then support majorana bound states when @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : changingphase ] , we demonstrate the possibility to tune between this limit and the previously considered system with vanishing @xmath4 , whilst retaining a degeneracy at all times .",
    "this provides further evidence for the existence of majorana bound states in the small @xmath4 limit , as we do not see any evidence for a phase transition during this tuning .",
    "if the large @xmath4 limit could be achieved in an experiment , it may have some advantages over wire systems in which the signatures of majorana bound states were previously measured .",
    "as the magnitude of the effective order parameter can be tuned , it should be relatively easy to find a region where majorana bound states are present .",
    "also , as our dots are discrete , we should hopefully be able to measure the localization of majorana bound states in a line of dots ( where a similar limit presents itself ) to the ends , as others should have minimal conductance .",
    "in this section we discuss the josephson supercurrent through the double quantum dot .",
    "specifically , we study the dependence of the supercurrent on the phase difference @xmath10 , and its behaviour when the magnetic flux passing between the dots is changed .",
    "the josephson supercurrent can be calculated as the derivative of the free energy with respect to the superconducting phase difference @xcite@xmath61 . in the limit of infinite @xmath62 ,",
    "supercurrent is absent in the odd parity state , as both local and crossed andreev reflection are not possible @xcite . by comparison , a josephson current exists for the even number parity sector , and is @xmath63 periodic in the absence of relaxation .",
    "a measurement of the periodicity of the josephson current could then be used to determine how well parity is conserved .",
    "if we start at some value of @xmath10 at which the system is non - degenerate , and tune it through a degeneracy , we shift the energy levels until they cross .",
    "if our system was perfectly conserving of parity , our now - excited state would not be able to relax into the new ground state , and the josephson current would either be @xmath63 periodic or flat , depending on the initial state of the system . however , as we are still connected to the superconducting leads , we would realistically expect some perturbation of these to occur after a finite period of time that would break this parity conservation .",
    "this would then correspond to a sudden jump to the ground state , and a corresponding change in the josephson current . as the perturbation frequency increases",
    ", the free energy would become a function of the entire system rather than one parity sector . in fig .",
    "[ josephsonnoparity ] , we plot this for various values of @xmath62 ( with parity - conserving counterparts inset , and vertical lines to indicate the values of @xmath10 required for a ground state degeneracy ) .",
    "measurements of deviations from this plot as the sweep time ( across @xmath10 ) is decreased would then give a measure of the coherence time of our system s parity conservation .",
    "if we measure the josephson current as we increase @xmath4 whilst holding @xmath64 ( which takes us towards the effective kitaev wire described previously ) , we find that the behaviour mimics that for increasing @xmath62 , except for one difference . at large @xmath4 , all four doubly occupied states are gapped out save for one ( where both electrons are spin - up ) , and our current is thus reduced four - fold .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ josephsonzfig ] .",
    "the similarity in behaviour between increasing @xmath62 and increasing @xmath4 provides further evidence that the majorana bound state picture is correct for the large @xmath62 limit , as it has similar characteristics to the large @xmath4 limit where majorana bound states are expected to appear .    in fig .",
    "[ doubleslitdiffraction ] we show the dependence of the supercurrent on the magnetic flux piercing the josephson junction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the standard fraunhofer pattern @xcite arises from interference of the supercurrent density in a junction , which can be thought of as a single slit of finite width .",
    "by contrast , we are considering a magnetic flux tube between the dots , and only allowing electrons to pass through either dot .",
    "this can be roughly considered a double - slit for electron transport . as",
    "such , we expect a double slit - like pattern in the critical current .",
    "we show this in fig .",
    "[ doubleslitdiffraction ] for both the even and odd sectors , and the entire system .    as @xmath62",
    "is increased , we see that the diffraction patterns for either number parity sector saturate , but at different levels . this is to be expected , as the even ground state permits crossed andreev reflection only , which has no dependence on the flux between the dots , whereas the odd ground state permits elastic co - tunneling only , which does not permit josephson current .",
    "however , it can also be explained by tunneling through the majorana bound states . to see this , consider the product @xmath65 of our majorana operators .",
    "this can be written as the sum of two parts , @xmath66 , which act on the odd and even sectors of the hilbert space individually .",
    "each term in the odd sector must contain a lone creation or annihilation operator from each site with either spin , and as our operators only act on the finite energy states , where fermion number is conserved , all terms will take the form of @xmath67 ( or the hermitian conjugate ) , multiplied by an appropriate number operator .",
    "this excitation then describes only elastic co - tunneling on the odd states . for the even states , we calculate explicitly",
    "@xmath68 we see here that the excitation describes only crossed andreev reflection for the even states .",
    "the majorana picture then gives the expected result for josephson current , justifying it further .",
    "the josephson current through the total system ( without parity conservation ) displays an interesting trait here , as it retains the double - slit pattern , but picks up a @xmath69 phase shift at @xmath70 .",
    "this is due to the josephson current in the even number parity ground state being the highest when the state is the highest energy , which then requires the odd number parity ground state to be higher energy still .",
    "this energy is @xmath5-dependent in the manner shown above . as such ,",
    "this is not a pattern caused by interference between electrons .",
    "we have investigated the double quantum dot model , first proposed in @xcite as a potential system to support majorana bound states .",
    "we have derived an effective hamiltonian of the system , and modeled the spectra , showing a range of parameters for which the system should be easily tunable to a degeneracy . in the limit as @xmath70",
    ", we have written down the form of a majorana bound state that excites between the ground states .",
    "we have shown that the degeneracy can be tuned continuously to a system equivalent to the one - dimensional wire model of kitaev .",
    "finally , we have discussed how measurements of the josephson current can display the conservation of parity in the system , and a measurement of the fraunhofer - type effect associated with josephson current that disappears when current travels through chargeless modes .    to the best of the authors knowledge this model",
    "presents the first example of majorana bound states in a system with strong correlations , where they do not present themselves as single - particle excitations .",
    "this makes it important to justify the fact that these excitations are majorana - like in nature .",
    "the similarities to the kitaev model , and the existence of a continuous transition to this model presents a strong case , which is backed up by the results from the josephson current . while the two - dot setup as proposed here is the simplest system to construct majorana bound states , observing non - abelian statistics from the many - particle majorana bound states demands larger systems to move the majorana bound states around each other .",
    "these larger systems will also provide topological protection as the majorana modes are separated by the number of dots @xcite .",
