    "a standard picture of the crab nebula was given by kennel and coroniti ( kc ; 1984 ) . according to their picture , a super - fast magnetohydrodynamic wind , which is generated by the central pulsar , terminates at a shock , with",
    "the nebula identified as a postshock flow shining in synchrotron radiation .",
    "the central cavity of the nebula is occupied by the unseen wind .",
    "the shock is supposed to occur at the standing inner wisp .",
    "the kc model is very successful explaining the synchrotron luminosity , spectrum and frequency - dependent size of the nebula .",
    "an important conclusion of the kc model is that the energy of the wind is conveyed mostly by kinetic energy in the bulk motion of the plasma .",
    "because the energy flux is in the form of an electromagnetic field at the base of the wind , this means that the efficiency of the wind acceleration is extremely high ; kc found it to be 99.7% .",
    "the principal parameters of the pulsar wind are ( 1 ) its luminosity @xmath2 , ( 2 ) the lorentz factor @xmath3 of the bulk flow and ( 3 ) the ratio @xmath0 of the electromagnetic energy flux to the kinetic energy flux , which is referred to as the magnetization parameter .",
    "@xmath2 is essentially the spin - down luminosity @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the remaining two parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath0 , together with the nebula pressure @xmath6 , or equivalently the equipartition field @xmath7 , determine the overall synchrotron spectrum .",
    "conversely , the synchrotron spectrum tells us about the parameters .",
    "given the synchrotron luminosity of @xmath8erg s@xmath5 , the nebula size of @xmath9  pc , and the peak and turn - off synchrotron spectrum energies of 2  ev and @xmath10  ev , respectively , one finds @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mg .",
    "this result can be obtained even with an order - of - magnitude estimate ( shibata , kawai and tamura 1998 ) .",
    "more rigorous fitting of the observed spectrum of the whole nebula gave similar values ( e.g. , kc , atoyan and aharonian 1996 ) . the field strength has been confirmed by observations of inverse compton emission in the tev band ( weekes et al .",
    "1989 ; hillas et al .",
    "thus , the dominance of the kinetic energy of the wind seems very firm .    from a theoretical point of view , however , the smallness of @xmath0 , or in other words dominance of the kinetic energy , is a mystery .",
    "no wind theory has been able to explain how such a high efficiency of acceleration is achieved .",
    "chandra observation clearly shows a disk - jet structure and moving wisps with seeds of @xmath14 ( mori 2002 ) , where @xmath15 is the speed of light .",
    "because the kc model is spherically symmetric and steady , it may seem insufficient to understand the highly structured and dynamical nature seen by chandra .",
    "however , the basic idea that a kinetic dominant wind shocks and shines seems still firm and convincing .",
    "one may assume that the equatorial wind has different parameters than the polar wind .",
    "such a latitude dependence of the wind parameters may suffice to explain the apparent disk - jet structure although how such a latitude dependence is made is not known .    in this paper , we suggest that high spatial resolution of chandra affords a chance to examine the assumptions which were made in the kc model but have yet to be checked . among the assumptions ,",
    "the ideal - mhd condition ( no dissipation ) and toroidal field approximation are of particular importance .",
    "if these assumptions are not adequate , the past conclusion of small @xmath0 may need to be reconsidered .",
    "we model the nebula in 3-dimensions based on the kc picture and reproduce an image , which can be compared with the chandra observation ( mori 2002 ) is made",
    ". we shall show that a considerable change to the kc picture is required to reproduce the chandra image . in this paper",
    ", we suggest that disordered magnetic field in the nebula is needed .",
    "some process which converts magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy , such as magnetic reconnection , may take place in the nebula . in a subsequent paper",
    ", spatially - resolved x - ray spectra will be described and compared with chandra results .",
    "we postulate that the nebula flow obeys the kc steady solution and do not solve the dynamics .",
    "the properties of the kc flow are summarized as follows .",
    "if @xmath0 is much less than unity as was suggested , the speed of the flow is @xmath16 just after the shock and decreases rapidly with distance from the pulsar @xmath17 as @xmath18 ; because the flow is subsonic , the pressure and density @xmath19 are roughly uniform as for adiabatic expansion such that the mass conservation , @xmath20const.(implying a decrease of the flow velocity ) . due to deceleration ,",
    "the magnetic field accumulates and is amplified according to the frozen - in condition , @xmath21 .",
    "once the magnetic field grows as large as the equipartition field , the magnetic pressure becomes important in the flow dynamics . as a result , the flow speed saturates",
    "this takes place where the nebula is brightest ( at @xmath22 shock radii ) .",
    "the smaller @xmath0 , the larger and brighter the nebula .",
    "the smallness of @xmath0 is then required to explain the luminosity and the extent of the nebula . the indicated flow speed is small if @xmath0 is small : @xmath23 .",
    "it is notable here that the above flow dynamics depends on the assumption of the ideal - mhd condition .",
    "the kc model is spherically symmetric and obviously inadequate to account for the observed morphology .",
    "we therefore restricted ourselves to an equatorial region of the kc spherical model with half width of @xmath24 and cut the intermediate latitude regions out , such that the disk may be reproduced in an image ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "although we assume a polar flow by leaving the polar region with a semi - opening angle of @xmath25 for reproduction of the jet image , this is just in an artist s spirit , and we do not provide any analysis of the polar jets in this paper .        our kinematic scheme to reproduce images of the nebula is made so that different types of the flow dynamics can be applied in the future ; i.e. , for a given velocity field , we trace a fluid element and associated particle distribution function according to the lagrangian view of fluid .    given the radial velocity field @xmath26 as a function of time and radial distance from the pulsar , the position of the fluid element , the toroidal magnetic field , and the proper density are respectively obtained from @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the observer s time and @xmath29 is the lorentz factor of the flow .",
    "we use the kc solution , which is given analytically , for the velocity field .",
    "although the kc solution does not include synchrotron losses , its effect on @xmath30 is supposed to be small because synchrotron losses are about 10% of the kinetic energy of the flow .    for the energy distribution of the particles , we again invoke the kc picture : a power law distribution is built up immediately after the shock , and the shock - accelerated particles simply lose their energy in the postshock flow by adiabatic and synchrotron losses .",
    "we trace the energy @xmath31 ( normalized by @xmath32 ) of each particle in a fluid frame by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the magnetic energy density , @xmath35 , is measured in the proper frame , and @xmath36 is the thomson cross section . the proper time @xmath37 is related to @xmath28 by @xmath38 .    the distribution function is defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pitch angle with respect to the local field and @xmath41 is the azimuth .",
    "note that the distribution function is defined in the flow proper frame .",
    "we assume that the postshock distribution follows a power law with index @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) in between the minimum energy @xmath44 and the maximum energy @xmath45 , and it is isotropic such that @xmath46 where the suffix ` i ' indicates ` injection ' at the postshock region , and the normalization is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 gives the postshock proper density .",
    "@xmath45 is assumed to be a maximum attainable value , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the shock distance from the pulsar , and @xmath51 is the postshock field .",
    "@xmath44 is determined so that the pressure calculated from @xmath52 satisfies the shock jump condition .",
    "we solve ( [ fele ] ) numerically for a sample of particles in a given fluid element , and thereby we obtain @xmath31 as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath28 .",
    "then we calculate distribution functions from @xmath54 for steady state models , integration for a single fluid element gives distribution functions in the whole nebula .",
    "it is obvious that the above kinematic scheme can be easily generalized for non - steady and non - radial flow , which can be obtained by numerical mhd simulations .",
    "once the evolution equations ( [ rv])-([fele ] ) are solved , and the distribution function is obtained by ( [ evolf ] ) , it is straight forward to get volume emissivity , which is integrated to give a nebula image .",
    "since the nebula flow is relativistic , a lorentz transformation is applied between the flow proper frame and the observer s frame ( or rather the pulsar frame , in which the pulsar is at rest ) .",
    "let us denote the 4-vector of a synchrotron photon by ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) in the observer s frame and ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) in the proper frame .",
    "if the ideal - mhd condition @xmath59 holds in the nebula flow , the transformation of the electromagnetic field is simpler : @xmath60 where the primes indicate the quantities in the flow frame and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are based on the directed of the flow velocity @xmath63 .",
    "there is no electric field in the plasma flow frame .",
    "the spectral power of a relativistic particle with pitch angle @xmath40 ( the angle of the particle motion to the local magnetic field in the proper frame ) is @xmath64 for the monochromatic approximation , we use @xmath65 , and for the relativistic approximation , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the critical frequency . the synchrotron power of a single particle is strongly beamed within a width of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the emission into a frequency interval @xmath70 and in a solid angle @xmath71 directed toward the observer is given by @xmath72 where @xmath40 is given by @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the unit vector directing to the observer in the proper frame .",
    "below , @xmath75 indicates the observer s direction in the observer s frame .    for the link between the proper frame and the observer s frame ,",
    "we include the doppler effects , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the unit vector of the flow direction is denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "the transformation between the received power @xmath80 and the emitted power @xmath81 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) is given by @xmath82 where the doppler effect ( [ dopper ] ) has been taken into account .",
    "finally the lorentz contraction is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the number density in the observer s frame .",
    "thus the emissivity in the observer s frame becomes @xmath85 where @xmath86      in order to specify the viewing angle of the observer , we relate the ` observer s coordinate ' @xmath87 ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , where @xmath91 directed toward the observer and @xmath92 directed toward north on the sky , to the ` nebula coordinate ' @xmath93 ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) , where the @xmath96-axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the nebula which is believed to be the rotation axis of the pulsar .",
    "we use 48@xmath97 and 28@xmath97 as the position angle and the inclination angle of the symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "an image of the nebula is obtained by @xmath98      for a given observation frequency , the integration ( [ imagint ] ) is done numerically for each ` pixel ' at ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) .",
    "the integrand is calculated as follows :    1 .",
    "given @xmath99 and @xmath100 , 2 .",
    "transformation from the observer s coordinates to the nebula coordinates is done ; for the position , @xmath101 , and also for the componets of the observer s direction , @xmath102 .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath103 and the magnetic field @xmath104 at the point are obtained by using the kc solution .",
    "note that the velocity and the magnetic field are respectively radial and azimuthal in the nebula coordinate. 4 .",
    "the observation frequency , the direction and the local magnetic field are transformed into those in the flow frame : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "the pitch angle of the particles directed toward the observer is obtained .",
    "6 .   regarding the distribution function at ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) , the emissivity in the flow frame is calculated ( we use the monochromatic approximation ) .",
    "finally , the emissivity is converted to the volume emissivity @xmath108 at ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) in the observer s frame by multiplying by the doppler factor @xmath109 .",
    "one may expect a ring - like structure in the reproduced image , such as observed with chandra ( see the top panel of fig .  2 ) , since we have assumed that the flow is restricted within a disk .",
    "the expected radius of the ring will be @xmath110 ( about 6 shock radii for @xmath111 ) , at which point the nebula brightens due to the amplified magnetic field .",
    "however , what we have is not a ring - like but is rather a lip - shaped image shown in the bottom panel of fig .  2 .",
    "at the north - east and south - west corners of the expected ellipse ( ring ) , the pitch angles of the particles directed toward us are small , and therefore the surface brightness is reduced . this effect combined with",
    "the central cavity yields an image which is lip - shaped. the smallness of pitch angle actually has two effects .",
    "one is that the single - particle emissivity is proportional to @xmath112 , which is small .",
    "the other is due to number of contributing particles . for a given observation frequency ,",
    "the energy of the particles radiating at the frequency is higher for smaller pitch angles , so that the number of particles contributing to the frequency is smaller because of the negative slope of the distribution function .     by kennel and coroniti ( 1984 ) but the flow",
    "is assumed to be restricted within an equatorial region .",

    "for the bottom image , the gray scale is in units of 0.016 erg s@xmath5 @xmath113 str ev .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    another important point to consider is the intensity ratio between the front and back sides of the ring .",
    "we obtain a value of 1.3 , but observed value is @xmath114 ( pelling et al .",
    "1987 , willingale et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the weak contrast is caused by deceleration of the nebula flow ( i.e. the smallness of @xmath0 ) .",
    "mori et al . ( 2003 ) suggest that the ratio is about 3 with chandra .",
    "this value is still incompatible with the kc picture .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    how surface brightness changes with distance from the shock depends on @xmath0 .",
    "mori ( 2002 ) also measured the surface brightness along the semi - major axis of the torus , from which doppler boosting should not affect the brightness .",
    "this result ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 ) is compared with the present model ( top panel of fig .",
    "3 ) , for which we provide curves of varying @xmath0 .",
    "the present model does not reproduce the first peak in the observation , which corresponds to the inner ring .",
    "however , it is notable that the brightness distribution of the inner ring is similar to that for the @xmath118 model .",
    "the location of synchrotron burn off is reproduced by the @xmath119 model .",
    "finally , we point out that the surface brightness decreases much faster with distance in the observation than in the model .",
    "as indicated by the lip - shaped image , the absolute value of the surface brightness is much less than observed along the semi - major axis . because the reproduced image includes only the disk component , to which we restricted ourselves ( rather than assuming the spherical kc model ) , the x - ray luminosity of the reproduced image is also smaller than the observation . for the image in fig .  2",
    ", we use parameters given by kc : @xmath120 erg s@xmath5 , @xmath121 cm , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath124 erg  sec@xmath5 at 1 kev .",
    "applying the kc model , we reconstruct an x - ray image which is found to be inconsistent with the chandra image . owing to a pure toroidal field and uniform pitch angle distribution , the reproduced image is not ring - like but lip - shaped. furthermore , the surface brightness contrast between the front and back sides of the ring is much less than the observed .",
    "the weak contrast is simply due to the smallness of @xmath0 , by which the postshock flow slows down quickly after the shock .",
    "the assumptions of the toroidal field and the smallness of @xmath0 are thus found to be incompatible with the observation .    if we assume isotropic emission in the proper frame such as is expected in a turbulent field , then the ring - like structure is reproduced as shown in fig .",
    "4 . as would be expected , we find that such a turbulent component must be at least comparable to the mean toroidal field in order to reproduce the ring image .",
    "although an another solution can be to adopt a contrived pitch angle distribution , we think this is unlikely . the image in fig .",
    "4 is produced in the following way : ( 1 ) assume the magnetic field is random so that the emissivity is isotropic in the proper frame ; ( 2 ) set the flow velocity to be 0.2@xmath15 by hand , ignoring the flow dynamics ; ( 3 ) let the distribution function and the field strength follow the kc model .",
    "thus , the random field and the fast flow are essential to reproduce the image .        with this practice",
    ", we suggest that the nebula field is far from pure toroidal , but rather is disordered .",
    "such a disordered field can be produced by magnetic reconnection or some instability of the toroidal flux tubes .",
    "if there is dissipation of the magnetic field , the flow dynamics is importantly changed , as is the flow speed . even if the value of @xmath0 , which is defined in the wind , is not small , dissipation in the nebula flow causes deceleration and brightening . in this sence",
    ", @xmath0 is effectively small so that the luminosity of the nebula will be explained as the kc model .",
    "but , such a simple heating may not always be good for explaining the surface brightness contrast because of the deceleration .",
    "recently , komissarov & lyubarsky ( 2003 ) provide an mhd simulation for the crab nebula , suggesting a complicated flow pattern and a high speed flow such that the brightness contrast can be reproduced .",
    "three dimensional motions associated with magnetic energy conversion in the nebula will considerably change the picture of the nebula .",
    "numerical simulations for the nebular flow is of particluar importance in the future study .",
    "as noted , the present image - production scheme will be easily extended to combine with such mumerical results .",
    "a model explaining the chandra observation may be constructed if we assume a larger @xmath0 and a subsequent magnetic energy conversion into heat and plasma kinetic energy , such as magnetic reconnection , in the nebula flow .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is rather large , then the postshock flow must be faster .",
    "the inner ring is formed at the shock .",
    "the brightness distribution will be similar to that of @xmath118 in fig .",
    "as the flow proceeds outward , the magnetic energy conversion takes place ( accelerating and heating the flow ) .",
    "this causes the second brightening .",
    "subsequently , the synchrotron burn - off provides the outer boundary of the torus .",
    "the doppler effect will cause a higher brightness contrast .",
    "we note that the smallness of @xmath0 is not obvious if non - ideal - mhd is introduced in the nebula flow .",
    "the above hypothesis explains the disk formation .",
    "obliqueness of the pulsar causes a series of current sheets with an interval of the light cylinder radius ( @xmath125 cm ) in the equatorial region .",
    "if the current sheets dissipate in the nebula , the synchrotron emission brightening is restricted in the equatorial region , where reconnection takes place .",
    "the appearance of pulsar nebulae should depend on obliqueness of individual pulsars .",
    "high obliqueness results in a thick disk and a high efficiency of synchrotron luminosity , while near - alignment causes a faint nebulae .",
    "the possibility of a dissipative process in the nebula may be examined more rigorously with spatially - resolved spectra , for which we will compare the model and the observation in a subsequent paper .",
