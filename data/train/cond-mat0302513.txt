    "the model of self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) is an important unsolved combinatorial problem in statistical mechanics @xcite . in this article",
    ", we consider the model of saps in two dimensions .",
    "saps counted by perimeter are the canonical model of ring polymers , while when also counted by area , they serve as a model of vesicles @xcite .",
    "the model also has connections with many other models of statistical mechanics where boundaries of certain cluster types play a role , notably in percolation and in spin models such as the ising model and the potts model , see also @xcite . despite its importance , there are only a few known rigorous results about saps , almost all information arising from numerical investigations @xcite . promising new developments however arise from the theory of stochastic processes @xcite , see also @xcite ( this volume ) .",
    "recently , we verified numerically a conjecture of one of us about the scaling function for saps , which describes the singular part of the sap perimeter and area generating function about its tricritical point @xcite .",
    "the prediction of the scaling function also gives the distribution of area moments .",
    "the conjecture was already stated in 1995 @xcite , as a result of a systematic investigation of simple exactly solvable subclasses of saps .",
    "there it was noticed that the critical exponents of _ rooted _ saps coincide with the exponents of staircase polygons , where the scaling function had been computed @xcite .",
    "this led to the question whether both scaling functions are of the same type .    over the years",
    ", it turned out that the mathematical structure underlying exact solvability is given by @xmath0-algebraic functional equations .",
    "they arise from the requirement that the polygon model is built up recursively , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this general type of functional equation appears first , within the framework of algebraic languages , in @xcite , together with the discussion of the area distribution for simple polygon models showing a square - root singularity .",
    "however , the article @xcite does not contain a derivation of its central result .",
    "recently , we investigated the scaling behaviour of general @xmath0-algebraic functional equations @xcite .",
    "the techniques used for handling @xmath0-algebraic functional equations are applicable in a wide variety of problems , see e.g. @xcite for exact low order cluster moments of asymmetric compact directed percolation .",
    "an important outcome of our previous analysis was that the scaling behaviour generically depends only on the singularity of the perimeter generating function .",
    "this remarkable kind of universality further supported the above conjecture and led us to test it numerically .",
    "very recently , investigations on the self - avoiding walk problem using the theory of stochastic processes led to a number of predictions of the behaviour of saps in the scaling limit .",
    "one of them is that the scaling limit of the half plane infinite sap is the outer boundary of the union of two brownian excursions from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in the upper half plane @xcite .",
    "since the area under a brownian excursion is airy distributed @xcite , this would suggest that the area moments of saps obey an airy type distribution .",
    "this is consistent with our conjecture that the sap scaling function is the logarithm of an airy function and also illuminates the connection with the model of staircase polygons , whose scaling limit is described by brownian excursions .    in the remainder of this article",
    "we first introduce polygon models , in particular self - avoiding polygons , and discuss their critical behaviour .",
    "we then consider @xmath0-algebraic functional equations and show how to extract scaling behaviour in the vicinity of a square - root singularity from the functional equation .",
    "the following section analyses the exactly solvable example of bar - graph polygons , using the techniques described in the previous section .",
    "the next section on self - avoiding polygons contains a summary of the analysis of recently obtained exact enumeration data for polygons on the square lattice to perimeter 100 , the hexagonal lattice to perimeter 140 and the triangular lattice to perimeter 58 .",
    "the analysis confirms the conjectured form of the scaling function in that predicted exact amplitude combinations are confirmed to within a numerical accuracy of 56 significant digits .",
    "this section also explains the monte - carlo simulation method , which we performed on the square lattice for polygons up to perimeter 2048 , and confirms the conjectured form of the scaling function within a numerical accuracy of 3 significant digits .",
    "a concluding section discusses possible applications of our results and methods .",
    "for concreteness , we discuss models of polygons defined on the square lattice @xmath3 . these models can be defined similarly for other lattices as well as in the continuous case .",
    "a _ self - avoiding polygon ( sap ) _ is a closed , non - intersecting loop on the edges of the square lattice .",
    "important subclasses are _ staircase polygons _ and _ bar - graph polygons _ @xcite , whose obvious definition may be extracted from figure [ fig : models ] .    whereas the latter two models have been solved exactly , as also discussed below , for saps there are very few rigorous results , complemented by a number of numerical investigations .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the number of different polygons of perimeter @xmath5 and area @xmath6 , respectively , where we regard translated polygons as equal .",
    "the object of interest is the _ perimeter and area generating function _",
    "@xmath7 where we introduced a perimeter activity @xmath8 and an area activity @xmath0 .",
    "sometimes , horizontal and vertical perimeter are distinguished , leading to an anisotropic perimeter and area generating function @xmath9 .",
    "the function @xmath10 is called _",
    "perimeter generating function_. of particular interest is the singular behaviour of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath0 , which translates to the behaviour of the coefficients @xmath4 in the limit of large perimeter and area .",
    "the above models display a so - called _ collapse transition _ between a phase of extended and a phase of deflated polygons @xcite : in the extended phase @xmath12 , the mean area of polygons @xmath13 of perimeter @xmath5 grows asymptotically like @xmath14 , whereas it grows like @xmath5 in the deflated phase @xmath15 .",
    "it can be shown that in the limit @xmath16 the generating function is dominated by polygons of minimal area . since for saps these polygons",
    "may be viewed as branched polymers , the phase @xmath15 is also referred to as the _ branched polymer phase_. this change of asymptotic behaviour is reflected in the singular behaviour of the perimeter and area generating function .",
    "typically , the line @xmath12 is a line of finite essential singularities for @xmath17 .",
    "the line @xmath18 , where @xmath11 is singular for @xmath15 , is typically a line of algebraic ( staircase , bar - graph ) or logarithmic ( saps ) singularity . for branched polymers in the continuum limit",
    ", the logarithmic singularity has been recently proved in @xcite ( see also this volume ) .    of special interest",
    "is the point @xmath19 where these two lines of singularities meet .",
    "the behaviour of the singular part of the perimeter and area generating function about @xmath19 is expected to take the special form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a _ scaling function _ of combined argument @xmath22 , commonly assumed to be regular at the origin , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are _ critical exponents_. the singular behaviour about @xmath12 at the critical point @xmath25 is then given by @xmath26 .",
    "this scaling assumption implies an asymptotic expansion of the scaling function of the form @xmath27 the leading asymptotic behaviour characterises the singularity of the perimeter generating function via @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the first singularity of @xmath21 on the negative axis determines the singularity along the curve @xmath18 .",
    "the locus on the axis ( say at @xmath30 ) determines the line @xmath31 near @xmath12 , which meets the line @xmath12 vertically for @xmath32 .",
    "the area moments @xmath33 are defined as coefficients of the ( formal ) expansion of the generating function about @xmath12 @xmath34 note that @xmath35 is the perimeter generating function .",
    "the higher moments @xmath33 can be computed recursively using @xmath36 , where @xmath37 using the functional equation @xcite .",
    "there is an important relation between the scaling function and the area moments : the coefficients @xmath38 in the asymptotic expansion of the scaling function are the leading singular amplitudes of the area moments @xmath33 .",
    "this follows from the scaling assumption which implies that the leading singular behaviour of the area moments is of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "thus , information about the scaling function can be obtained from the leading singular behaviour of the area moments which are , in turn , obtainable by a numerical analysis , extrapolating finite - size data .",
    "due to the difficulty of the sap problem , simple subclasses of saps have been analysed in the past ; for example rectangles , ferrers diagrams , stacks , staircase polygons , bar - graph polygons , convex polygons and column - convex polygons , among others @xcite .",
    "all these models share the special property that they are directed , i.e. they can be thought of as being built up by adding consecutive layers of squares .",
    "this results in a special recursion for the coefficients @xmath4 or a specific functional equation for the generating function @xmath11 . over the years",
    "it has become clear that the underlying structure is a _",
    "@xmath0-algebraic functional equation _ of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a polynomial in @xmath43 and @xmath0 .",
    "all exactly solved polygon models satisfy such a functional equation ( with @xmath8 conjugate to the ( horizontal ) perimeter and @xmath0 conjugate to the area ) . for the example of bar - graph polygons , see the next section .",
    "no such recursion is known for saps , however .",
    "the limit @xmath44 in ( [ form : qalg ] ) generally leads to an _ algebraic _ differential equation , i.e. an algebraic equation in @xmath8 , @xmath10 and its derivatives .",
    "the exactly solved polygon models , however , result in a purely algebraic equation , i.e. in the non - trivial polynomial identity @xmath45    not much is known about the singular behaviour of general @xmath0-algebraic functional equations .",
    "the @xmath0-linear case , however , has been treated in some detail , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the polygon models of rectangles , ferrers diagrams , and stacks are @xmath0-linear @xcite , whereas the other exactly solved models cited above satisfy @xmath0-quadratic functional equations . using ( [ form : alg ] ) , we see that the perimeter generating function @xmath10 displays an algebraic singularity at some point @xmath25 . the most direct way to extract the scaling function about @xmath46 and @xmath12 , whose existence we assume , from the defining @xmath0-functional equation , is to insert the ansatz ( [ form : scaling ] ) into the functional equation , introduce the scaling variable @xmath22 and expand the functional equation to leading order in @xmath47 .",
    "this will , to lowest order in @xmath48 , result in a differential equation for the scaling function @xmath21 . above method",
    "is also called method of _ dominant balance _ @xcite . note first that the expansion of the generating function with @xmath0-shifted argument is given to leading order by @xmath49 we will analyse the case of a square - root singularity of the perimeter generating function in detail .",
    "( the case of a simple pole is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "it imposes the restrictions @xmath50 on the functional equation , evaluated at @xmath51 .",
    "we introduced the abbreviations @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "the assumption of a square - root singularity also implies @xmath55 for the critical exponents , as follows from the relation @xmath29 .",
    "the functional equation then has an expansion of the form @xmath56 to lowest orders in @xmath48 . in order to obtain a non - trivial equation for the scaling functions , we demand equality of the coefficients .",
    "this results in exponents @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and we get the riccati equation @xmath59 where the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 the equation , together with the prescribed asymptotic behaviour , has the unique solution @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the airy function .",
    "the scaling function is regular at the origin , and its first singularity on the negative real axis is a simple pole , located at @xmath65 .",
    "it is important to notice that the functional form of the result is _ independent _ of the detailed form of the functional equation , as long as the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 are nonzero and finite ! thus , the scaling behaviour is determined by the type of singularity of the perimeter generating function .",
    "this remarkable kind of universality allows us to conjecture the functional form of the scaling function for self - avoiding polygons : together with the ( numerical ) observation that the perimeter generating function of the model of @xmath66 saps @xmath67 also has a square - root singularity , one might ask if it has the scaling function ( [ form : logairy ] ) .",
    "the model of bar - graph polygons has been defined and solved exactly in @xcite .",
    "we review the derivation and extract the scaling behaviour as outlined above .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the anisotropic perimeter and area generating function for bar - graph polygons .",
    "the variable @xmath0 is conjugate to the area , while the variables @xmath8 and @xmath68 are conjugate to the horizontal and vertical perimeters respectively . by partitioning the set of bar - graph polygons into subsets of inflated and concatenated ones",
    ", it is straightforward to show that @xmath9 satisfies a @xmath0-quadratic functional equation in the horizontal perimeter variable @xmath8 and the area variable @xmath0 @xmath69 this is depicted in figure [ fig : barrek ] .",
    "the @xmath0-quadratic functional equation can  similarly to the treatment of a riccati differential equation  be linearised by means of the transformation @xmath70 and the resulting @xmath0-linear functional equation of order two for @xmath71 can be solved by iteration .",
    "this leads to @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the @xmath0-product .",
    "the appearance of a @xmath0-series is a generic feature of solutions of @xmath0-algebraic functional equations , making it difficult to extract the asymptotic behaviour for @xmath44 directly from an exact solution . for staircase polygons , the first exactly solved model with a @xmath0-quadratic functional equation @xcite ,",
    "this has been done by use of saddle point techniques @xcite , and this method can also be applied to the above solution .",
    "a more direct approach consists in deriving the ( anisotropic ) scaling function directly from the defining functional equation by use of the above methods . to this end , note that the defining polynomial is of the form @xmath74 .",
    "the perimeter generating function may be found by setting @xmath12 and solving the functional equation for @xmath10 .",
    "it has a square - root singularity at @xmath75 .",
    "an analysis along the above lines yields @xmath76 and the scaling function is the logarithmic derivative of an airy function , given by ( [ form : logairy ] ) .",
    "the critical exponents are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the model of _ rooted _ saps , @xmath67 , has been analysed numerically some time ago , where it was found to exhibit the same exponents @xmath57 and @xmath58 as bar - graph ( staircase ) polygons which , in particular , implies a square - root singularity of the perimeter generating function ( see also @xcite ) . with the improved series data now at hand and the refined techniques of analysis , we were able to confirm our conjecture about the scaling function to high precision using data obtained from exact enumeration for small values of perimeter , on the square lattice and on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "in addition , it allowed us to analyse the first two corrections to scaling @xcite . here , we present results obtained from an analysis of extended enumeration data for square , hexagonal and triangular lattices and in addition we present data for the square lattice obtained from monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the scaling behaviour of rooted saps may be arbitrarily well approximated by the scaling behaviour of solutions to a @xmath0-algebraic functional equation with a square - root singularity .",
    "the scaling function ( [ form : logairy ] ) implies certain relations between the amplitudes @xmath38 of the leading singularity ( [ form : gsing ] ) of the area moment functions @xmath33 . using the riccati equation ( [ form : riccati ] ) for the scaling function",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath77 , where the numbers @xmath78 are given by the quadratic recursion @xmath79 the first few values are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 may be estimated from series enumeration data : assuming an asymptotic growth of coefficients of the area moment functions @xmath33 of rooted saps of the form @xmath90 g_k(x ) \\sim ( -1)^k e_k x_c^{-m } m^{\\gamma_k-1 } \\qquad ( m\\to\\infty)\\ ] ] implies a singular behaviour of @xmath33 of the form ( [ form : gsing ] ) with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the constant @xmath93 is defined such that @xmath4 is nonzero only if @xmath5 is divisible by @xmath93 .",
    "thus @xmath94 for the square and hexagonal lattices and @xmath95 for the triangular lattice .",
    "note that the amplitudes @xmath96 , defined by ( [ form : fsize ] ) , take the same values for rooted saps and for ( ordinary ) saps .",
    "extrapolation techniques allow us to estimate @xmath25 , @xmath97 and @xmath96 to high precision .",
    "this route was followed in @xcite where we used series data from exact enumeration up to perimeter 86 on the square lattice and up to perimeter 29 on the triangular lattice , where the same behaviour ( [ form : fsize ] ) is expected due to universality .",
    "since then the enumeration of area - moments for square lattice saps has been extended to perimeter 100 ( 110 ) @xcite , and series have been derived for the hexagonal lattice to perimeter 140 ( 156 ) and the triangular lattice to perimeter 58 ( 60 ) @xcite , where the numbers in parenthesis refer to slightly longer series calculated for the perimeter generating function .",
    "details of analysis can be found in @xcite and a brief summary will suffice here .",
    "estimates for the critical points and exponents are obtained using the numerical technique of differential approximants @xcite . for the square and hexagonal lattices , where @xmath94 and only coefficients with @xmath5 even are non - zero , we actually analyse the functions @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and 6 is the perimeter of the smallest sap on the square and hexagonal lattices , respectively .",
    "a singularity at @xmath46 in @xmath33 thus becomes a singularity at @xmath100 in @xmath101 .",

    "since @xmath105 the singularity at @xmath106 is exponentially suppressed as @xmath107 , however for small values of @xmath5 it still has a significant influence on the coefficients in the generating functions and we have to add an extra sequence to the fit similar to ( [ form : momampl ] ) : @xmath108.\\ ] ] we obtain several data sets by varying the number of terms used in the fit . only the even coefficients are used in these fits for square and hexagonal saps . to obtain the final estimates we do a simple linear regression on the data for the amplitudes as a function of @xmath109 extrapolating to @xmath110 .",
    "we estimate the error in the amplitude from the spread among the different data sets . in this way",
    ", we obtain the results for the amplitude combinations listed in table  [ tab : momampl ] , which have been shown to be independent of the underlying lattice @xcite .",
    "the scaling function prediction for these numbers is @xmath111 for @xmath112 , where we used the known result that @xmath113 @xcite , and the numbers @xmath114 are defined in ( [ form : c ] ) .",
