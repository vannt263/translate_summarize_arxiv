    "relativistic jets are associated with active galactic nuclei and quasars ( * agn * ) , with black hole binary star systems ( * microquasars * ) , and are thought responsible for the gamma - ray bursts ( * grbs * ) . in microquasar and agn jets proper motions of intensity enhancements show mildly superluminal for the microquasar jets @xmath0 ( mirabel & rodriquez 1999 ) , range from subluminal ( @xmath1 ) to superluminal ( @xmath2 ) along the m87 jet ( biretta et al .",
