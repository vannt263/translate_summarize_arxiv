    "transport in tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) systems has gained a lot of attraction since the appearance of experimental realizations of tlls , such as cleaved edge overgrowth quantum wires and single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) . however",
    ", a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment often suffers from the fact that the interaction parameter @xmath3 of the tll is not very well known and does not affect the dc conductance and the shot noise of clean wires attached to fermi liquid leads . as a hallmark of the tll model has served the power law dependence of the nonlinear conductance of impure wires with respect to temperature and/or applied voltage , which has been observed in transport measurements in semiconductor quantum wires @xcite as well as in nanotubes .",
    "@xcite however , some doubts in the determination of @xmath3 often remain , since dynamical coulomb blockade leads as well to a power law when the system is embedded in an ohmic environment .",
    "@xcite it has been shown recently that both the intrinsic interactions and the environmental resistance enter on equal footing in @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite thus , it is important to have alternative ways to measure @xmath3 in order to validate the existence of tll systems in nature .",
    "crucial ingredients , which have been disregarded in earlier theoretical work on transport in tlls , @xcite are the finite wire length and the role of the electron reservoirs . a first step towards a better understanding of such systems has been taken by modelling the reservoirs as one - dimensional non - interacting leads , introducing the inhomogeneous tll ( it ll ) model .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the dc conductance of the it ll is independent of the electron interaction strength .",
    "the analysis of this result has lead to a new phenomenon : a momentum conserving reflection at the contacts due to strong electronic correlations in the wire and their absence in the leads .",
    "@xcite this effect is similar to the andreev reflections at a metal - superconductor contact .",
    "@xcite apparently , a finite wire behaves as an andreev - type resonator for plasmon excitations : an electron incident from a contact is transmitted in a series of current spikes , which sum up to the flux of an electron , so that ultimately the incident particle is perfectly transmitted .",
    "this dynamics gives rise to nontrivial correlation functions .",
    "@xcite the it ll model has also been applied recently to study the effects of the fermi liquid leads on tunneling from an stm tip into a nanotube.@xcite apart from the it ll model , the finite length of an interacting quantum wire ( qw ) is also taken into account in the approach of open boundary bosonization @xcite .",
    "however , there the wire is taken as a disconnected object with sharp edges .    in the presence of an impurity in the qw ,",
    "the it ll model in its standard form @xcite can only be treated perturbatively for weak ( or strong ) impurity strength . as far as the calculation of the average current",
    "is concerned , this problem can in principle be eluded by modelling the presence of non - interacting leads through radiative boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite these have been combined with methods of refermionization @xcite and integrable field theories @xcite to obtain the exact current voltage characteristics .",
    "the non - perturbative analysis of refs .",
    "[ ] is restricted , up to now , to an infinitely long wire , and it is currently not clear whether this approach can also be applied to the calculation of current fluctuations . for a finite one - dimensional wire at low energies ,",
    "an alternative formulation of the radiative boundary conditions in terms of operators instead of expectation values has been proposed.@xcite this approach recovers the quasi - andreev reflections , and could perhaps also enable a treatment of the noise.@xcite    both the voltage dependence of the differential conductance and the frequency dependence of the spectrum of the noise are expected to provide valuable information on interaction effects in a finite length qw . in ref .  [ ] we have determined the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics of a qw with an impurity for the case of zero temperature , taking its finite length explicitly into account through the it ll model .",
    "the @xmath5 characteristics shows interaction - dependent oscillations that are due to interference effects between the andreev - type reflections at the wire - lead contacts and the backscattering at the impurity site . in the present article",
    ", we analyze in detail how these oscillations are modified at finite temperature . for a qw with applied voltage @xmath6 at temperature @xmath7",
    "there is now apart from @xmath8 and @xmath9 a third relevant energy scale @xmath10 , where the ballistic frequency @xmath1 is the ratio of the plasmon velocity @xmath11 and the length of the wire @xmath4 .",
    "as an important consequence of this new energy scale , the current as a function of @xmath7 at @xmath12 and the current as a function of @xmath6 at @xmath13 are not simply related to each other by an interchange of @xmath8 and @xmath9 as it is the case in the homogeneous tll .    the main purpose of the present work , however , is to go beyond the investigation of dc properties of it ll systems by looking at the finite frequency ( ff ) current noise .",
    "much of the recent interest in noise comes from the fact that shot noise may allow to determine the effective charge that is backscattered off an impurity in the qw .",
    "@xcite due to the dominance of @xmath14 noise at low frequencies , shot noise is never really measured at zero frequency , but only down to the khz range .",
    "this raises the question on the influence of a finite measurement frequency on the shot noise level .",
    "this issue has been addressed theoretically for a four - terminal fractional quantum hall edge state geometry .",
    "@xcite however , the analysis was restricted to chiral tlls at zero temperature and infinite system size , which effectively corresponds to a vanishing ballistic frequency @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , as will be shown in the present paper , for non - chiral tlls the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath1 crucially affects the properties of ff noise .",
    "for this reason , it is essential to adopt a model which takes the finite length of the system into account . here",
    ", we address this problem within the it ll model .    from an experimental point of view , there is an advantage in studying ff noise as compared to the ac conductance .",
    "while recent theoretical work @xcite has predicted that the ac conductance exhibits andreev - type oscillations , the high frequency range of these oscillations can not easily be explored in experiments .",
    "the problem is that the frequency @xmath16 of the reservoir potential in ac measurements must be low enough to ensure that inelastic processes are sufficiently efficient to establish quasi - equilibrium distributions as assumed in the theory .",
    "@xcite this means that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the characteristic time for inelastic thermalization processes .",
    "however , the frequency @xmath0 that appears in the expression of the ff noise derived below is not limited by such assumptions .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to measure ff noise in a dc biased circuit .    in the regime",
    "@xmath19 , the shot noise of an it ll system in the presence of a weak backscattering potential has been shown to be given by a @xmath3-independent classical schottky formula @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the backscattering current .",
    "@xcite hence , the shot noise is proportional to the electron charge @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , in the homogeneous tll model , the fractional charge extracted from the ratio of the noise and the backscattering current in the weak backscattering limit is given by @xmath23 and thus depends on the interaction parameter @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite this has essentially been confirmed in shot noise measurements on fractional quantum hall edge state devices at filling fraction @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite however , these systems are described by the chiral tll model , where right and left movers are spatially separated and the effect of contact electrodes is quite different from the non - chiral case discussed here .",
    "now , the question arises , if it is possible to observe the fractional charge @xmath23 also in qw realizations such as cleaved edge overgrowth qws or swnts .",
    "as we have shown recently@xcite , at frequencies @xmath25 , the effective charge extracted by averaging the ff noise in it ll systems over a frequency range is indeed the quasiparticle charge @xmath23 and not the electron charge @xmath22 .",
    "the origin of this behavior is easily understood : on the one hand , for @xmath26 , the noise probes current correlations on long time scales allowing for a large number of scattering processes ( at the impurity and andreev - type reflections at the boundaries to the leads ) .",
    "thus , the noise probes the current correlations of the non - interacting leads with a complicated scatterer  the interacting qw and the impurity . on the other hand , in the case @xmath25 , intrinsic spectral properties of the qw",
    "determine the ff noise .",
    "here , we go beyond the analysis of ref .  [ ] by explicitly considering the influence of finite temperature on the equilibrium as well as non - equilibrium current noise of a finite - length qw coupled to electron reservoirs .",
    "our general result for the ff noise of a wire with arbitrary length @xmath4 describes the crossover between the shot noise results for homogeneous tll @xcite and it ll systems.@xcite the observability of the fractional charge backscattered at an impurity in a carbon nanotube has also recently been discussed for a four - terminal setup.@xcite however , the hamiltonian used in ref.does not take the role of the fermi liquid leads fully into account and entails a factor of @xmath3 in the shot noise strength even at @xmath27 in contrast to the findings in refs .  [ ] .    on the experimental side , there has been considerable progress in the study of ff noise , recently .",
    "the ff noise of an electrically driven two - state system has been measured , @xcite and the high frequency current noise in a diffusive mesoscopic conductor has been observed .",
    "@xcite the low frequency regime has also been explored experimentally : shot noise has been measured in bundles of carbon nanotubes @xcite and in swnt .",
    "@xcite however , the nature of the system in the former case and the analysis of data in the latter case do not allow to conclude whether the theoretical predictions @xcite on the shot noise in non - chiral tll systems have been confirmed or not , so that further work is needed .",

    "the interaction parameter @xmath35 is space - dependent and its value is @xmath3 in the bulk of the wire , 1 in the bulk of the leads , and supposed to change smoothly from 1 to @xmath3 at the contacts . a schematic view of this model is shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "the variation of @xmath35 is assumed to occur within a characteristic smoothing length @xmath36 .",
    "the profile of the function @xmath35 then identifies two energy scales @xmath37 and @xmath38 , associated with the length @xmath4 of the wire and the smoothing length  @xmath36 .",
    "we assume here that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron fermi wavelength . under these conditions ,",
    "the electron - electron interaction in the bosonized language remains quadratic in the field @xmath41 , and no backscattering term arises at the wire - lead interfaces , as it is expected for adiabatic contacts .",

    "the precise form of the variation of @xmath35 at the contacts from @xmath3 to 1 is therefore not physically relevant to our purposes , and it is consistent to simplify the calculations by adopting a step - like function , namely @xmath45 if @xmath46 is in the wire ( i.e. if @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 if @xmath46 is in the leads ( i.e. if @xmath49 ) , _ cf . _",

    "( [ l0 ] ) , although being of the same order as the ( equilibrium ) bare fermi velocity of the system , may not exactly coincide with the latter .",
    "indeed , as customary when adopting a continuum limit of a lattice model , the actual value of @xmath2 can be renormalized by the electron density as well as by the interaction .",

( [ lv ] ) describes the coupling to the electro - chemical bias due to the leads . in most experiments ,",
    "leads are normal 2d or 3d metals , and a detailed description of them would require the standard fermi liquid model .",
