    "one of the fundamental properties of a superconductor is the meissner - ochsenfeld effect@xcite .",
    "it states that at low magnetic fields and frequencies a superconductor expels or excludes any magnetic flux from its core .",
    "however , at the surface the field penetrates on a typical length scale @xmath9 called the magnetic penetration depth . in the london limit@xcite , for a semi - infinite superconductor , the functional @xmath10 vs.  @xmath11 dependence is an exponential one .",
    "this approximation holds for a large class of superconductors .",
    "however , as found by pippard from a set of microwave experiments on impurity doped type - i superconductors@xcite , this is not always true . in analogy with the anomalous skin effect",
    "pippard introduced the concept of non - local response of the superconductor , i.e. the screening current trying to expel the magnetic field must be averaged over some spatial region of the order of @xmath12 called the coherence length .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath12 is , that it is the length over which the superconducting wave function can be considered as rigid , i.e.  roughly speaking the size of a cooper pair ( for details see sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "the non - local electrodynamical response leads to various modifications of the london theory , one being that the magnetic penetration profile @xmath0 is no longer exponential and even changes its sign beneath the surface of the superconductor .",
    "all these findings were confirmed by the microscopic bcs theory@xcite .",
    "although these theoretical predictions have been known for half a century , only very recently has a `` direct '' measurement of the functional dependence of @xmath0 been demonstrated@xcite .",
    "a historical summary of the experimental work on this subject begins with that of sommerhalder and co - worker@xcite who showed the existence of a sign reversal of @xmath0 by measuring the magnetic field leaking through a very thin superconducting tin film .",
    "et al._@xcite applied magnetoabsorption resonance spectroscopy techniques to tackle the problem .",
    "the technique uses the fact that quasi - particles traveling parallel to the shielding current are bound to the surface by an effective magnetic potential .",
    "indication of non - local effects in al were inferred by comparing microwave induced resonant transitions between the energy levels of these bound states with transition fields calculated from the energy levels of the trapping potential , parameterized to include the shape of the non - local bcs - like potential . due to the resonant character of the experiment ,",
    "only a few specific points of the potential are probed .",
    "in addition the normal metallic state has to be understood very well in order to interpret the data .",
    "this , together with uncertainties in modeling the surface bound states , leaves room for speculations .",
    "polarized neutron reflectometry has also been applied since specular reflectivity of neutrons spin polarized parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath13 depends on the field profile .",
    "however , this technique requires model - fitting of spin - dependent scattering intensities rather than giving a direct measure of the spatial variation of the magnetic field . up to now",
    "non - local corrections have been found to lie beyond the sensitivity of polarized neutron reflectivity techniques@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present magnetic field profiles measured beneath the surface of various superconductors in the meissner state by means of low energy muon spin rotation spectroscopy ( le-@xmath14sr ) .",
    "the results provide a direct and quantifiable measure of non - local effects in the investigated materials ( nb , pb , ta ) and permit the extraction of physical parameters such as the magnetic penetration depth @xmath9 and the coherence length @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section reviews the theoretical framework necessary to understand the results and the discussion",
    ". section [ sec : experimental ] provides some information on the experimental technique including the characterization of the samples . in sec.[sec : results ] we present our data , including a discussion , followed by a summary in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , the theory of the response of a superconductor in respect to an external electromagnetic field will be sketched ( for a rigorous derivation see ref .  ) .",

    "one can show@xcite that the following non - local relation between the current density @xmath19 and the vector potential @xmath20 , where @xmath13 is the magnetic induction , holds :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the charge , @xmath24 the supercurrent density , and @xmath25 the effective mass of the charge carrier .",

    "@xmath29 describes the paramagnetic response , whereas the second term in the bracket reflects the diamagnetic one . if the ground state wave function of the superconductor were `` rigid '' with respect to _ all _ perturbations ( rather than only those which lead to transverse excitations ) @xmath30 would be identically zero and eq.([eq : j_vs_a ] ) would reduce to the second london equation    @xmath31    with the london penetration depth @xmath32 , and @xmath33 the permeability of the vacuum .",
    "this , together with the maxwell equation @xmath34 , results , for a semi - infinite sample , in the well known penetration profile    @xmath35    where @xmath11 is the depth perpendicular to the surface and @xmath36 the externally applied magnetic field strength .    in situations",

    "this equation reduces obviously to an exponential decay if @xmath38 is independent of @xmath40 , and in the london limit @xmath41 .",
    "eq.([eq : bz ] ) is valid in the case of specular reflection of the charge carriers at the surface .",
    "another extreme limit is given by assuming diffuse scattering at the interface .",
    "a real system will not be exactly in one of the two limits .",
    "since a quantitative analysis@xcite shows that the difference in @xmath9 is marginal , we use eq.([eq : bz ] ) for the following discussion .",
    "still , we have verified by numerical integration of eq.([eq : j_vs_a ] ) that @xmath0 for specular and diffuse scattering are closely related .",
    "since the electromagnetic response of the superconductor is on the length scale of @xmath9 , a local description would be sufficient if the kernel @xmath42 is constant in the interval @xmath43 . in the next paragraphs",
    "we will show that @xmath42 is approximately constant for @xmath44 . from this",
    "it follows , that for @xmath45 ( type ii ) the local london limit should be quite reasonable , whereas in the opposite limit @xmath46 ( type i ) this is not the case . for the type ii case",
    ", non - local effects might play a role either in case the energy gap exhibits nodes and henceforth @xmath12 will be very anisotropic@xcite or if @xmath47 .",

    "an example of an extreme type - i superconductor , al , is presented in fig.[fig : hz_example ] . as intuitively expected compared to the local case ,",
    "the initial slope of @xmath0 is reduced , reflecting the fact that the magnetic field penetrates deeper into the superconductor .",
    "the @xmath70 inset of fig.[fig : hz_example ] shows initially a clear negative curvature , i.e. a deviation from the exponential behavior .",
    "the next important feature to be noticed is the sign reversal of the magnetic field before approaching zero deep inside the sample .",
    "all these findings can be made plausible by the following hand waving arguments : in the non - local case the cooper pairs are very extended compared to the magnetic penetration profile .",
    "since the partners within a cooper pair do not experience the same field , the screening response is less effective and hence the slope is less steep compared to a local response .",
    "this has a second effect : since the field penetrates further beneath the surface , at some depth enough cooper pairs will experience it and start to `` overcompensate '' , which accounts for the negative curvature as well as for the field reversal of @xmath0 before approaching zero .",

    "the inset shows the same curve in a log scale.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      the bcs weak coupling theory assumes a weak electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this is definitely not the case for either pb or nb .",
    "therefore , the much more elaborated strong - coupling theory@xcite has to be used to calculate the properties of the superconductor .",
    "a recent review describing the strong coupling theory is found in ref .  .",
    "fortunately , the outcome for the magnetic penetration profile @xmath0 in the meissner state is almost the same . in particular eq.([eq : bz ] ) still holds , and the structure of the kernel eq.([eq : k_bcs ] ) is not altered , except for a renormalization of @xmath6 and @xmath5 as shown by nam@xcite .",
    "these two length scales are renormalized as    @xmath73    where the renormalization factors @xmath74 for pb , nb and ta are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77@xcite .",

    "the magnetic penetration profile @xmath0 into the superconductor has been determined on the nano - meter scale , thus providing a model independent measure of the meissner screening profile .",
    "@xmath0 shows clear deviations from the simple exponential decay law as expected in the pippard regime where the relation between the current density and the vector potential is non - local in nature . analyzing the data within the pippard and bcs model , the coherence length @xmath6 and the london penetration length @xmath5",

    "the time domain modeling used in our analysis has the disadvantage of introducing systematic errors and only one of the discussed approaches is acceptable for the investigation of non - local effects .",
    "two sets of models , which will be discussed separately in the following paragraphs , can be treated analytically .",
    "the resulting trend is similar in both cases , meaning that the `` mean value determination '' ( sec.[app : mean_value_reconstruction ] ) slightly overestimates the real @xmath0 , whereas the `` peak value determination '' ( sec.[app : peak_value_reconstruction ] ) always slightly underestimates @xmath0 . in the situation where one is looking for non - local effects , characterized by an initial negative curvature of @xmath70 ,",
    "the mean value reconstruction is the method of choice because only it can produce systematic errors with a positive curvature , and henceforth , in the worst case , can only hide the presence of a negative curvature .",
