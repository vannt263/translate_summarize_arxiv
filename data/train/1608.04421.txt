    "baryonic collapse appears to lead to two distinct populations of objects : ( 1 ) stars ( and associated planets ) ; ( 2 ) supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",

    "strong shocks in or between proto - galaxies ( inayoshi & omukai 2012 ; inayoshi et al .",
    "these models generally involve complex accretion flows and/or feedback environments that make model predictions very uncertain , e.g. , for how often smbh formation occurs .",
    "another scenario involves a very massive stellar seed forming in the center of a dense stellar cluster by a process of runaway mergers ( grkan et al .",
    "2004 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ; freitag et al .",
    "however , the required stellar densities are extremely high ( never yet observed in any cluster ) and also stellar wind mass loss may make growth of the central very massive star quite inefficient ( vink 2008 ) , unless the metallicities are very low ( devecchi et al . 2012 ) .",
    "again , predictions of such models for the cosmic formation rates of smbhs are limited since it is difficult to predict when and how the necessary very dense star clusters are formed .",
    "yet another scenario proposes that smbhs form from the remnants of population iii ( pop iii ) stars , i.e. , those forming from metal - free gas with compositions set by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "mckee & tan ( 2008 ) distinguished two classes of pop iii stars .",

    "the masses of pop iii.2 stars are thought to be significantly smaller than those of pop iii.1 stars due to enhanced electron fractions in the irradiated gas that promotes @xmath22 and hd formation ( greif & bromm 2006 ) .    however , the ultimate masses of pop iii.1 stars are quite uncertain .",

    "their formation redshifts extended from @xmath32 down to @xmath33",
    ".    while the above estimates for pop iii.1 masses are certainly top heavy compared to present - day star formation , they are still relatively low compared to the masses of smbhs .",
    "to reach @xmath34 in a few hundred myr would require near continuous maximal ( eddington - limited ) accretion .",
    "such accretion seems unlikely given that massive pop iii.1 stars would disrupt the gas in their natal environments by radiative and mechanical feedback ( e.g. , oshea et al . 2005 ; johnson & bromm 2007 ; milosavljevc et al .",
    "2009 ) .    one potential mechanism that may allow supermassive pop iii.1 stars to form is heating by weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter self - annihilation ( spolyar et al .",
    "2008 ; 2009 ; natarajan , tan & oshea 2009 , hereafter nto09 ) , which may keep the protostar large and cool , so limiting its ionization feedback .",
    "nto09 estimated that for the early phases of protostellar evolution to be significantly affected by wimp annihilation heating the wimp mass needs to be @xmath35 several  @xmath36  gev .",
    "such wimp masses are consistent with recent estimated constraints on @xmath37 based on constraints on the wimp annihilation cross section coupled with the requirement that the actual cross section should equal the thermal relic value of @xmath38 ( i.e. , that necessary for all , or most , dark matter to be composed of wimps ) .",

    "( 2015 ) report @xmath40  gev for wimps annihilating via quark and @xmath41-lepton channels .",
    "such results suggest there is only a relatively narrow range of wimp masses that are viable for this scenario of dark matter powered pop iii.1 protostars .",
    "also , direct detection experiments that constrain ( spin dependent and independent ) wimp - nucleon elastic scattering cross sections have yet to detect signatures of wimp dark matter ( e.g. , agnese et al . 2014 ; akerib et al .",
    "while these results do not provide a firm constraint on the value of @xmath37 , they do have implications for the ability pop iii.1 protostars to capture wimps of a given mass via such scattering interactions .",
    "spolyar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) followed the growth of pop iii.1 protostars including the effects of annhilation heating from their initial and captured dark matter .",
    "we note that such dark matter powered protostars are objects that collapse to densities quite similar to those of normal protostars : e.g. , for the initial model considered by spolyar et al . , which has @xmath42 and soon achieves a radius of @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44  au , the central densities are @xmath45 and the mean densities @xmath46 . in their cannonical case without captured wimps collapse of the protostar to main sequence was delayed until about @xmath47 .",
    "they also considered a `` minimal capture '' case with background dark matter density of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( for spin - dependent scattering relevant to h ) that results in about half the luminosity being from annihilation of captured wimps ( with @xmath50  gev ) and the other half from nuclear fusion at the time the protstar joins the main sequence .",
    "the results from akerib et al .",
    "( 2016 ) imply this @xmath51 , so the fiducial capture model of spolyar et al .",
    "is still allowed by recent dark matter search constraints . while spolyar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented a case in which the protostar reached @xmath52 , depending on the wimp mass and the capture history of dark matter to the protostar , much larger masses , @xmath53 are possible ( chanchaiworawit & tan , in prep . ) .",
    "however , wimp annihilation heating is only expected to be significant in pop iii.1 protostars if these objects are co - located near the peaks of their natal dark matter minihalos .",
    "such co - location may be disturbed if pop iii.1 star formation involves substantial fragmentation , e.g. , leading to binary star or multiple star formation , that results in the primary star being displaced from the `` central region '' of the dark matter cusp . as discussed above ,",
    "spolyar et al . (",
    "2009 ) have presented a case in which effective wimp annihilation heating alters the evolution of the protostar for a dark matter density of @xmath54 .",
    "for the three example minihalos considered by nto09 , the initial radii defining such a central region are 72 , 45 and 89  au . in the simulation of stacy",
    "2014 ) , which follows the interaction of an `` active '' dark matter halo that has its central density reduced by interactions with a clumpy accretion disk , this radius is still @xmath55  au at the end of their simulation , 5000  yr after first protostar formation .",
    "limited fragmentation during initial collapse of minihalos was seen in the cosmological simulations of turk , abel & oshea ( 2009 ) : about 80% of their minihalos appear to collapse to a single protostellar `` core , '' i.e. , the self - gravitating gas in which a single rotationally supported disk will form .",
    "however , a number of authors have claimed that later fragmentation of the primary protostar s accretion disk may lead to formation of multiple lower mass stars leading to either formation of a close binary or even a cluster of pop iii stars .",
    "clark et al .",
    "( 2011 ) followed the evolution to about 110  yr after first protostar formation , including effects of protostellar heating on the disk . by this time",
    "the protostar had accreted almost 0.6  @xmath56 .",
    "it still resided near the center of its accretion disk , which , being gravitationally unstable , had also formed three lower mass ( @xmath57 ) protostars .",
    "greif et al . (",
    "2011 ) followed the collapse and fragmentation of five different minihalos to about 1000  yr after first protostar formation , by which time masses of several solar masses had been achieved .",
    "they typically observed several tens of protostars forming by fragmentation in the main accretion disk , although describe that most are likely susceptible to merging with the primary protostar ( a process they could not follow in their simulations ) .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2012 ) carried out similar simulations , but now including the effects of wimp annihilation on the chemistry and thermodynamics of the collapse .",
    "they found much reduced fragmentation : in one case only a single , primary protostar formed ; in another , just one secondary protostar .",
    "the primary protostars reached @xmath58 and remained in the central regions of their host minihalos .",
    "stacy et al . ( 2014 ) also carried out such simulations , but now with no protostellar heating feedback .",
    "they formed a primary protostar that reached @xmath59 after 5000  yr along with several lower - mass companions .",
    "this primary protostar was still located in a zone with dark matter density @xmath60 .",
    "however , the propensity of protostellar accretion disks to fragment will also depend on the magnetic field strength in the disk and none of the above fragmentation studies have included @xmath61-fields .",
    "dynamo amplification of weak seed fields that arise via the biermann battery mechanism may occur in turbulent protostellar disks : see , e.g. , tan & blackman ( 2004 ) ; schleicher et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ; schober et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ; latif & schleicher ( 2016 ) .",
    "these studies all predict that dynamically important , near equipartition @xmath61-fields will arise in pop iii protostellar disks . from numerical simulations of local star formation",
    "it is well known that such @xmath61-fields generally act to suppress fragmentation compared to the unmagnetized case ( e.g. , price & bate 2007 ; hennebelle et al . 2011 ) .",
    "magnetic fields would similarly be expected to reduce the density fluctuations in the accretion disks and the size of the disks , which would then reduce the amount of gravitational interaction that is seen to dilute the dark matter density cusp in the simulation of stacy et al .",
    "if early fragmentation is suppressed then this may allow the primary protostar to achieve a significant mass and luminosity that its radiative feedback then later becomes the dominant means of limiting fragmentation .    in summary , whether or not a single dominant , centrally - located protostar is the typical outcome of collapse of minihalos is still uncertain .",
    "such outcomes are seen in some pure hydrodynamic simulations of collapse , especially when the effects of dark matter annihilation heating are included .",
    "if magnetic fields can be amplified to near equipartitition by an accretion disk dynamo , then this outcome is expected to be even more likely to occur .    on the other hand , pop iii.2 stars ,",
    "if formed in a minihalo that undergoes very significant early stage fragmentation to multiple `` cores , '' are not generally expected to be co - located with the dark matter density peak .",
    "co - location will also not occur for stars forming in more massive halos , where gas atomic cooling allows formation of a large scale rotational supported thin disk , which then fragments to form the stellar population , i.e. , the early stages of a galactic disk .",
    "we thus regard formation of dark matter powered pop iii.1 stars as a potentially attractive mechanism to explain the origin of , potentially all , supermassive black holes .",
    "if most of the initial baryonic content of the pop iii.1 minihalos , i.e. , @xmath17 , is able to be accreted to the protostar , which then undergoes the general relativistic instability leading to direct collapse to a black hole , then this would explain the absence of supermassive black holes with masses @xmath62 .",
    "this lower limit to the masses of smbhs is not easily explained in other formation models .",
    "our goal in this paper is to assess the predictions of such a model for the formation of smbhs via the statistics of minihalos that are likely to undergo pop iii.1 star formation , especially their formation history , their overall number density and their clustering properties .",
    "the radiative influence on a halo from a neighboring source and its effect on subsequent star formation is a very complicated problem ( e.g. , whalen et al .",
    "for simplicity we will therefore parameterize the required `` isolation distance , '' @xmath63 , that is needed for a given halo to be considered `` undisturbed '' from other astrophysical sources and thus be able to form a supermassive pop iii.1 star that becomes a smbh .",
    "future papers will then consider more detailed , physical models for this isolation distance .",
    "we utlilize pinocchio ( pinpointing orbit crossing collapsed hierarchical objects ) , which is a code based on lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) ( moutarde et al . 1991 ; buchert & ehlers 1993 ; catelan 1995 ) for the fast generation of catalogs of dark matter halos in cosmological volumes . starting from a realization of a gaussian density field in a box sampled by @xmath64 particles , using an ellipsoidal collapse model",
    ", the code computes the time at which each particle is expected to suffer gravitational collapse ( i.e. , `` orbit crossing , '' when the map from initial , lagrangian , to final , eulerian positions becomes multivalued ) , then collects the collapsed particles into halos with an algorithm that mimics their hierarchical clustering .",
    "the result is a catalog of dark matter halos with known mass , position , velocity and merger history .",
    "the code was introduced in its original form by monaco , theuns & taffoni ( 2002 ) , where it was demonstrated that it can accurately reproduce `` lagrangian '' quantities like halo masses and merger histories .",
    "this was later confirmed by other groups ( see the review in monaco et al .",
    "a massively parallel version was presented by monaco et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and recently extended and tested by munari et al .",
    "( 2016 ) . in this last paper",
    "it was shown how the clustering of halos improves when higher orders of lpt are used . as a result , clustering in @xmath65-space",
    "is well reproduced , to within a few per cent , up to a wavenumber of at least @xmath66 mpc@xmath67 mpc@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the normalized hubble parameter and will be used in lieu of @xmath70 henceforth .",
    "a degradation of quality is seen at @xmath71 , where the density field becomes significantly non - linear .",
    "clustering in configuration space is very well reproduced on comoving scales larger than @xmath72 mpc = @xmath73 mpc .",
    "in this paper we use the latest code version with 2lpt displacements , that give a very good reproduction of clustering while keeping memory requirements to @xmath74 bytes per particle , thus allowing running of large boxes ( 3lpt would require nearly twice as much memory ) .",
    "pinocchio is well - suited to the study of the formation of first stars and smbhs from high @xmath75 , relatively low - mass halos spanning large cosmological volumes . adopting a standard planck cosmology : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( planck collaboration 2015 )",
    ", we simulate a 40.96 @xmath83 mpc comoving cubical box sampled with @xmath84 particles , thus reaching a particle mass of @xmath85 .",
    "this allows us to sample a @xmath86 halo with @xmath2110 particles .",
    "we first run the simulation down to redshift of 15 .",
    "this required 10 pb of ram and took less than an hour on 1376 cores of the galileo@cineca machine , most of the time being spent in writing 211 outputs from @xmath87 to @xmath88 in redshift steps of @xmath89 .",
    "we then continued the simulation down to @xmath14 , outputing in steps of @xmath90 .",
    "this is the largest pinocchio run ever presented in a paper .    from the simulation outputs ,",
    "we identify halos that form pop iii.1 stars by looking for minihalos with masses just crossing a threshold of @xmath91 , which are also isolated from any other minihalos ( i.e. , that host pop iii.1 , pop iii.2 or pop ii sources ) by a proper distance of @xmath92 .",
    "we consider values of @xmath93  kpc .",
    "once halos have been tagged as being pop iii.1 sources we then track their subsequent evolution . for the next 10  myr after the start of their formation they are assumed to be pop iii.1 stars .",
    "this would correspond to the accretion timescale to build up a @xmath94 star if its accretion rate were @xmath95 , a typical accretion rate expected for such sources ( e.g. , tan & mckee 2004 ) .",
    "after 10  myr , the pop iii.1 star is assumed to collapse into a smbh remnant .",
    "the halo containing this remnant is tracked down to @xmath14 .",
    "the halo grows in mass by both accretion of dark matter particles ( i.e. , sub - minihalos ) and by merger with already identified minihalos and larger halos . during a merger of two halos ,",
    "the more massive halo retains its identity and typically the smbh will be occupying the more massive of the two merging halos .",
    "occasionally the smbh and its host halo merge with a more massive halo , in which case the presence of the smbh is transferred to this new halo .",
    "sometimes two merging halos will each already host a smbh : this situation is expected to lead to smbh - smbh binary in the center of the new halo and thus potentially a merger of the two black holes .",
    "in this paper we focus on smbh locations , number densities and host halo properties , and defer modeling of smbh growth due to gas accretion ( i.e. , active galactic nuclei ) to a future paper .",

    "this approximation ignores the finite light travel time across the thickness of the box , which means that the projection of the total source population is roughly equivalent to observing a finite redshift interval of the real universe . at @xmath14 , 15 , 20",
    "these redshift intervals are @xmath1620.28 , 0.49 , 0.75 , respectively . of course for direct comparison with agn populations one would also need to model the duty cycle of emission and the luminosity function and spectral energy distribution properties of the accreting smbhs .",

    "overall the 2pacfs of both cases are relatively flat , especially compared to that of all halos with masses @xmath131 , which is shown by the green dashed line in these figures . for @xmath132  kpc , there is a sign of modest excess clustering signal on angular scales @xmath177 .",
    "for @xmath146  kpc , with a smaller number of sources and thus larger poisson uncertainties , there is hint of a decrease of @xmath172 below the poisson level on scales @xmath178 .",
    "this could be related to the angular scale of the 100  kpc proper distance of the feedback distance @xmath92 at @xmath179 , which corresponds to a comoving distance of @xmath180  mpc . by @xmath14",
    "this corresponds to an angular scale of 64 .",
    "thus the signature of feedback cleared bubbles , which have a deficit of smbhs due to destruction of pop iii.1 seeds , may be revealed in the angular correletion function . in particular , effective feedback suppression of neighboring sources",
    "leads to a relatively flat angular correlation function .     and @xmath181 remnants at @xmath14 .",
    "the error bars indicate shot noise in each angular separation bin . for comparison we have also plotted the 2pacf of all the halos with mass greater than @xmath182 at @xmath14 ( green dashed curve ) .",
    "it rises sharply at small scales , which shows they are highly clustered ( it reaches a value of @xmath183 at 100  and @xmath184 at 20 . ]",
    "we have presented a model for the formation of supermassive black holes from the remnants of special population iii stars , i.e. , pop iii.1 stars that form in isolation from other astrophysical sources .",
    "the physical mechanism motivating this scenario involves the pop iii.1 protostar being supported by wimp dark matter annihilation heating ( spolyar et al .",
    "2008 ; natarajan et al .",
    "2009 ) , so that it retains a large photospheric radius while it is accreting .",
    "this reduces the influence of ionizing feedback on the protostar s own accretion ( mckee & tan 2008 ) , allowing it gather most of the @xmath185 of baryons present in the host minihalo .",
    "while many of the details of this scenario remain to be explored , our approach here has been to focus on the pop iii.1 star and smbh populations that form in such a model , particularly their dependencies on the isolation distance , @xmath92 , that is needed for pop iii.1 formation .",
    "assuming that all smbhs are produced by this mechanism , we have found that to produce the required number density of sources that can explain local ( @xmath4 ) smbh populations requires @xmath186  kpc ( proper distance ) . with such values of @xmath92",
    "we do not expect mergers of smbhs to be too significant .",
    "for this model the formation of pop iii.1 stars and thus smbhs peaks at @xmath187 and is largely completed by @xmath188 . by @xmath14 the smbhs tend to reside in halos @xmath189 , extending up to @xmath190 .",
    "the angular correlation function of these sources at @xmath14 is very flat , with little deviation from a random distribution , which we expect is a result of a competition between source feedback and the intrinsic clustering expected from hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the preferred value of @xmath191  kpc proper distance has implications for the physics of the process .",
    "the size of the ionized zone ( strmgren radius ) around a source that is ionizing the diffuse cosmological gas at @xmath192 ( we assume the baryon density is @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the critical density with @xmath195 , and the mass per h is @xmath196 , given @xmath197 ) is @xmath198 where we have normalized to an ionizing photon luminosity of @xmath199 , which is an approximate estimate for that expected for a @xmath94 pop iii zero age main sequence star ( e.g. , extrapolating linearly ( @xmath200 from the models shown in tan & mckee 2004 , which extend up to @xmath201 ) that may appear as part of the evolution from pop iii.1 protostar to smbh remnant .",
    "we have also normalized to an ionized gas temperature of @xmath202 , appropriate for primoridial composition gas and assumed singly ionized he .",
    "it is striking that this simple estimate for a feedback radius due to ionizing feedback is very similar to the values of @xmath92 that are required by this scenario of pop iii.1 seeds of smbhs to explain the local number density of these sources .",
