    "a bar - joint framework in real euclidean space @xmath7 is a geometric realisation of the vertices of a graph with the edges considered as inextensible bars between them .",
    "such a framework is said to be rigid if there is no non - trivial continuous motion of the framework vertices which maintains bar - lengths , and is said to be flexible if it is not rigid . a foundational theorem of laman , obtained in 1970 , asserts that the rigidity of a generically positioned framework in the plane depends only on the underlying graph and furthermore these graphs are characterised in terms of a simple counting condition .",
    "there is also an elegant recursive construction of the minimally rigid frameworks going back to henneberg @xcite in which each framework may be derived from a single edge framework by repeated application of two simple construction moves , namely the henneberg 1 move and the henneberg 2 move .",
    "analogous characterisations for frameworks in @xmath8 remain open problems and no combinatorial characterisation of generic rigidity is known .",
    "we note however that a number of partial and related results are given in whiteley @xcite and that the longstanding molecular conjecture has been resolved by katoh and tanigawa .    attention has also been given to frameworks in @xmath0-dimensional space whose vertices are constrained to @xmath1-dimensional surfaces .",
    "in @xcite we obtained laman - henneberg - type theorems for the case of constraint to parallel planes , concentric spheres and concentric cylinders .",
    "the cylinder case presents new complications both for the purely graph theoretical analysis and for the preservation of rigidity under the henneberg moves and the further construction moves that are needed .",
    "a fixed plane surface in @xmath8 supports a three - dimensional vector space of internal infinitesimal motions , coming from translations and rotations , while the ( infinite circular ) cylinder has two such independent motions .",
    "more formally , in definition [ d : surfacetype ] we define the type @xmath9 of an irreducible algebraic surface where @xmath9 takes values @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "( see also definition [ d : surfacetype2 ] . )",
    "the type of a surface is reflected in the graph counting conditions for laman type theorems ; fewer independent infinitesimal motions for the surface imply a richer set of graphs which in turn require more constructive moves and more refined proof techniques .",
    "the main result in the present paper is the following theorem for bar - joint frameworks in @xmath8 whose vertices are constrained to an algebraic surface @xmath12 of type @xmath2 .",

    "the proof of the main theorem is principally concerned with the sufficiency for rigidity of the combinatorial condition and we obtain this by showing that each of the moves in the constructive sequence for the graph preserves generic rigidity . we introduce some new methods for this and there are two moves that present particular challenges , namely the henneberg @xmath1 move and the vertex - to-@xmath21 move .",
    "for the henneberg @xmath1",
    "move we give two quite different proofs which also give new proofs in the case of the circular cylinder .",
    "the first of these uses a convergence argument involving a sequence of generic realisations of @xmath23 which converge to a degenerate non - generic realisation of @xmath23 which in a natural sense covers a generic realisation of @xmath15 . on the other hand in section [ sec : algh2 ] we adopt the traditional approach of algebraic specialisation to obtain a direct entirely algebraic proof .    for the vertex - to-@xmath21 move we show that proper flexes are inherited under the inverse move @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath21 contraction to a vertex .",

    "we note that whiteley @xcite has considered the topic of frameworks on surfaces with geodesic edges and there the appropriate combinatorial objects are looped multigraphs .",
    "moreover , rigidity is expressed in terms of the rank of the @xmath9-frame matrix rather than the rigidity matrix .",

    "we have @xmath445 .",
    "also , since the first row of the matrix @xmath446 is zero we get a non - zero contribution to @xmath447 only from the action of the @xmath448 operator on the first row of @xmath449 .",
    "thus , in vector form , @xmath447 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath450 expanding the determinant along the final column gives @xmath451 and so from the above @xmath452 for all @xmath152 with the property that @xmath453 .",
    "the vector @xmath454 satisfies @xmath453 and @xmath455 gives the condition @xmath456 where @xmath457 we have @xmath458 because the condition that @xmath459 for all @xmath200 , @xmath460 on @xmath12 contradicts the smoothness requirement that @xmath461 becomes parallel to @xmath462 for @xmath200 and @xmath460 close to @xmath241 .",
    "thus @xmath463 which is contrary to our original choice of @xmath30 and so we conclude that @xmath30 does not extend to a flex of @xmath403 .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that a flex @xmath464 of @xmath465 on @xmath12 does extend to a flex @xmath466 of @xmath403 on @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath413 is the solution of the three equations @xmath467 and the solution is unique because @xmath468 for generic @xmath469 for the same reason given above that @xmath458 .",
    "also if @xmath30 is zero then @xmath466 is zero and so every flex in the nullspace of @xmath470 is the extension of a flex of @xmath405 .    finally , consider the matrix @xmath471 of size @xmath472 . since @xmath15 is independent we have @xmath473 and @xmath474 .",
    "for the matrix @xmath475 of size @xmath476 we have @xmath477 and @xmath478 and so @xmath479 and @xmath480 .",
    "every flex of @xmath481 either does not extend to a flex of @xmath482 or extends to a unique flex of @xmath482 and every flex of @xmath482 is the extension of some flex of @xmath481 .",
    "thus @xmath483 . by lemma [ lem1 ]",
    "the rank of @xmath482 is @xmath401 which means that @xmath404 is independent on @xmath12 , as required .",
    "[ lem1 ] let @xmath482 be an @xmath476 matrix with @xmath479 and @xmath481 an @xmath472 matrix with @xmath484 and @xmath485 .",
    "if @xmath480 and @xmath486 then @xmath487 .",
    "@xmath488 and @xmath489 so @xmath490 .",
    "there is a final independence preserving move that we need for the proof of the main result .",
    "recall that if @xmath15 and @xmath91 are graphs with vertices @xmath491 then the _ edge joining move _ combines @xmath15 and @xmath91 by adding the edge @xmath492 .",
    "[ edgejoin ] let @xmath12 be an irreducible surface of type @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath493 be minimally infinitesimally rigid on @xmath12 , and let @xmath23 be an edge join of @xmath15 and @xmath91 through an edge @xmath492 .",
    "if @xmath494 and @xmath495 are greater than @xmath22 and @xmath496 is generic on @xmath12 then @xmath497 is generically minimally infinitesimally rigid on @xmath12 .",
    "consider the block matrix form @xmath498 by the hypotheses the nullspaces of the rigidity matrices @xmath34 and @xmath499 are one - dimensional .",
    "let @xmath500 be an infinitesimal flex of the edge - joined framework and let @xmath492 be the joining edge for @xmath23 .",
    "subtracting a tangential rigid motion infinitesimal flex we may assume that @xmath501 assigns a zero velocity to the framework joint @xmath502 .",
    "since @xmath501 is a flex of @xmath14 on @xmath12 it follows that @xmath503 also in view of the generic row in @xmath504 for the joining edge it follows that @xmath505 assigns a velocity to the framework vertex @xmath506 which is linearly independent from the one - dimensional space of velocity vectors of @xmath506 obtained from infinitesimal flexes of @xmath493 .",
    "it follows that this velocity on @xmath506 is zero and hence that @xmath505 is zero .",
    "thus @xmath507 and the nullspace of @xmath504 has dimension one , as desired .",
    "we now arrive at the proof of our main result , theorem [ conetorustheorem ] . for the reader",
    "s convenience we first re - state the theorem .    [ conetorustheorem2 ]",
    "let @xmath13 be a simple graph and let @xmath12 be an irreducible surface of type @xmath2 .",
    "then a generic framework @xmath14 on @xmath12 is isostatic if and only @xmath15 is @xmath16 or is @xmath3-tight .    that the underlying graph of an isostatic framework on @xmath12 is @xmath3-tight or is a small complete graph follows from theorem [ necessity ] . for the sufficiency direction one can check that the minimal graph @xmath20 in the inductive characterisation of @xmath3-tight graphs is isostatic on @xmath12 .",
    "the sufficiency of @xmath3-tightness now follows from theorem [ t:21characterisation ] if minimal generic rigidity is preserved by henneberg 1 and 2 moves , the vertex - to-@xmath21 move , the vertex - to-@xmath22-cycle move and the edge joining move .",
    "this is the content of lemma [ hen1 ] , lemma [ hen2independent ] , corollary [ vertex2k4 ] , lemma [ l : vertexto4cycle ] and lemma [ edgejoin ] .",
    "note that we could also have used theorem [ 21 ] , applying lemma [ vertexsplitprop ] , to prove the theorem .",
    "we finish by noting some further natural considerations for frameworks constrained to surfaces .    the assumption , in theorem [ conetorustheorem ] , that @xmath12 is irreducible merits two comments .",
    "firstly , it is required to avoid to surfaces composed as unions of surfaces of differing numbers of internal motions .",
    "for example if @xmath12 was the union of two cylinders with distinct but parallel axes then consideration of theorem [ unioncylinders ] instantly shows that simply being @xmath3-tight is not the correct characterisation . secondly ,",
    "if @xmath12 is reducible but each component is irreducible then we do not expect any great difficulty in extending our results .",
    "for example we expect that theorem [ conetorustheorem ] is true for concentric cones , torii or elliptical cylinders .",
    "the usual two - dimensional torus embedded in @xmath0-dimensional space has freedom type @xmath2 and so isostatic frameworks on this surface are characterised as in the previous theorem .",
    "when the torus is realised in @xmath508 one may also consider the _",
    "clifford torus _",
    "@xmath509 , that is , the real algebraic variety and smooth manifold defined by the polynomial equations @xmath177 and @xmath510 .",
    "the definition of type ( freedom number ) given in definition [ d : surfacetype ] extends without change to an algebraic surface @xmath12 in @xmath7 .",
    "in particular the clifford torus has freedom type @xmath1 .",
    "the rigidity analysis in this setting requires us to adapt the definition of the rigidity matrix .",
    "the details are similar to those in definition [ rigiditymatrixdef ] with the following changes .",
    "there are now @xmath22 columns per vertex and @xmath1 rows per vertex where the rows for vertex @xmath513 ( and corresponding framework point @xmath514 ) are zero except in the @xmath22-tuple corresponding to @xmath513 where the entries in the first row are @xmath515 and the second are @xmath516 .",
    "on the other hand take the product of a circle and an ellipse .",
    "this is the algebraic variety @xmath517 defined by , say , @xmath177 and @xmath518 in @xmath508 .",
    "@xmath517 admits exactly @xmath2 trivial motion .",
    "adapting the methods of the last section would lead to the @xmath5-tight and the @xmath3-tight characterisations of frameworks on @xmath509 and @xmath517 respectively .",
    "it is natural to seek a similar characterisation of our main result in the case of frameworks with vertices constrained to an irreducible surface of type @xmath11 .",
    "there are a variety of such surfaces that a characterisation could apply to including an elliptical cone , a mobius strip , a hyperboloid and a hyperbolic paraboloid .",
    "note that the graphs of rigid frameworks need not be connected in this setting . as a starting point ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition @xmath519 ) gives the necessity of the graph being simple and @xmath520-tight and we expect that the rigidity preservation methods in this paper will be useful in deriving a characterisation .",
    "however , there are immediate additional complications to establishing sufficient conditions , not least since any simple @xmath520-tight graph containing a subgraph isomorphic to @xmath521 has a dependent rigidity matrix on any surface .",
    "this can easily be seen by noting that @xmath521 is not @xmath522-sparse and hence is dependent in @xmath8 .",
    "we also remark that @xmath520-tight graphs may be @xmath22-regular so additional degree 4 operations seem to be necessary ( such as @xmath162-replacement , see ) .",
    "this fact , together with the fact that an inductive scheme would have to avoid creating @xmath521 subgraphs , and the fact that there are many simple @xmath520-tight graphs ( even on small vertex sets ) that can not be generated using the operations in this paper , with @xmath162-replacement , all suggest that the analogue of theorem [ t:21characterisation ] for simple @xmath520-tight graphs , without @xmath521 subgraphs , will be significantly more challenging to establish .",
