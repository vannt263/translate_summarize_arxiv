    "for several centuries it has been known that a sizeable subset of the stars exhibits a variable energy output ( luminosity ) .",
    "the best known and best studied of these variable stars are the cepheids that have a clock - like periodicity .",
    "their notoriety comes from the tight relation between their period and luminosity and their consequent role as cosmological distance indicators . in parallel",
    ", there exists a class of variable stars with light - curves that instead exhibit various degrees of irregularity .",
    "these objects undergo changes in luminosity that can be as large as a factor of forty , indicating violent radial ( i.e. @xmath2 ) pulsations .",
    "very little theoretical attention had been devoted to these stars .",
    "why do we think that the dynamics underlying these irregular pulsations could be low dimensional and chaotic ?",
    "one of the reasons is that decade old numerical hydrodynamical simulations showed low dimensional chaotic behavior and period doubling cascades in models.@xcite however , the observational confirmation of low dimensional chaos in these stars , that is the subject of this paper , had to wait a little longer for a number of reasons .",
    "nonlinear techniques are new in variable star astronomy , and it is therefore hard to find data sets that are suitable for a modern nonlinear time series analysis and the search for low dimensional chaos . partially because of the long periods involved , typically tens to hundreds of days , rarely are enough pulsation cycles covered , or they are covered incompletely . generally , professional astronomers have not seen any merit in dedicating the necessary telescope time to what the consider the gathering of useless erratic data .",
    "in contrast , thanks to the observations of numerous amateur astronomers , the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) has recently made available long and relatively well sampled light - curve data of two stars , r scuti and ac herculis .",
    "( in astronomy variable stars were named after the constellation in which they appear preceded by one or two capital letters , until the letters were exhausted ) .",
    "both objects are characterized by irregular cycles of @xmath3 75d and 35d , respectively , with alternating shallow and deep minima .",
    "the details of the analyses of these light - curves have been published elsewhere.@xcite here we present a summary review .",
    "1 displays typical subsections of the two data sets ( points ) with the solid line showing our smoothed and interpolated fit ( see below ) .",
    "these data have been taken visually by many amateur observers worldwide at essentially random times .",
    "therefore there is considerable scatter in the data and there are some observational gaps .",
    "we have plotted the lightcurves in magnitudes ( for historical reasons defined as @xmath4 luminosity ) rather than the more physical luminosity . for both data",
    "sets the error in the magnitudes is found to have a normal distribution , independent of the magnitude ( which is not true for the luminosity itself ) .",
    "the reason is to be found in the visual nature of the observations and the logarithmic response of the human eye .",
    "we thus work with the magnitude .",
    "although the individual observations have a large error associated with them ( 0.20 and 0.15 mag , in r  sct and ac  her , resp . )",
    "it is possible to extract a reasonably accurate light - curve by averaging and interpolating .",
    "the individual errors are larger for r  sct , but there are about four times as many data points and the pulsation amplitude is about a factor of 4 larger , so that the error on the final interpolated curve is much smaller for r  sct than for ac  her .    the preparation of the data is a delicate process .",
    "we want to eliminate as much observational and other extrinsic noise as possible .",
    "however there is additional intrinsic noise associated with turbulence and convection in the star that , strictly speaking , is part of the dynamics . it is well known that well developed turbulent motions constitute high - dimensional behavior , and _ a priori _ it may be objected this would preclude us from uncovering any low dimensional dynamics .",
    "the success of our nonlinear analysis provides an _ a posteriori _ indication that the pulsation can be separated into a large amplitude true pulsation , and a low amplitude pulsational jitter .",
    "our pre - smoothing eliminates this high - dimensional jitter together with the true noise , leaving a signal that represents the true low dimensional dynamics .",
    "to be specific , the bare data were first averaged in 5.0 day bins for r  sct and in 2.5 day bins for ac  her , followed by a cubic spline smoothing , where the smoothing parameter @xmath5 was a free parameter in the flow reconstruction below .",
    "the result is then a lightcurve data set that is sampled at equal time - intervals",
    ".    figs .  2 and 3 in the top rows show the smoothed and interpolated observational data of r sct and ac her , respectively . in fig .",
    "4 we display the ( normalized ) amplitude fourier spectra of the two observed lightcurves .",
    "the fs of r  sct has much broader features than the more regular ac  her as is to be expected from the appearance of the lightcurves .",
    "it is also of interest to look at the broomhead  king ( bk ) projections@xcite of a signal .",
    "these projections onto the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix are optimal for spreading out the features of the signal .",
    "the lowest bk projections for r  sct and ac  her are thus shown in columns 1 and 5 in fig .",
    "5 .    before proceeding with a nonlinear analysis aimed at discovering and describing low dimensional chaos we briefly mention further tests to ascertain that the signals can not be the result of a multi - periodic ( n - torus ) dynamics .    for r  sct",
    "we have performed the following tests.@xcite taking the frequencies of the highest 35 peaks in the fs ( fig .",
    "2 ) we have made a multi - periodic fourier fit for the 35 amplitudes and phases .",
    "the fit is quite good over the temporal range of the data set , but when it is _ extrapolated _ in time the signal totally fails to resemble the r  sct lightcurve .",
    "similarly , a linear autoregressive process with white noise ( ar or arma ) bears little resemblance to the data .",
    "both tests indicate that the process that produces the lightcurve is strongly nonlinear.@xcite    for ac  her , the situation is not so clear - cut because of the high noise level .",
    "we note here prewhitening with the frequencies of the 24 highest fs peaks leaves a noise level that is at least 34 times the noise that is expected from the observational error.@xcite    there are theoretical reasons for not thinking that so many frequencies could be observed .",
    "first these stars are believed to be radial pulsators , and the radial modal spectrum does _ not _ have a structure similar to that of the highest peaks of the fs .",
    "further , even if one insisted on nonradial modes , the visual observations are necessarily whole disk observations which can not possibly resolve nonradial modes with @xmath6 . again",
    "the required modal spectrum would not be compatible with stellar structure.@xcite    the stars can not be evolving ( time - dependent ) multiperiodic systems either .",
    "otherwise there should be a correlation between the multitude of smaller peaks in the fourier spectrum when subsequent sections of the data are fourier analyzed , which is not the case .",
    "we conclude that neither the r  sct nor the ac  her lightcurve can reasonably be explained as being periodic or multi - periodic .",
    "we now make the assumption that the observed lightcurve @xmath7 has been generated by a low dimensional dynamics in some physical phase - space of _ a priori _ unknown properties , i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10 dimensional state vector of the system .",
    "we could equivalently assume a stroboscopic description of the dynamics @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath13 is a smooth function of the phase - space variable @xmath14 .",
    "a standard reconstruction method starts with the construction of the standard @xmath15dim delay vectors@xcite @xmath16 the _ global _ flow reconstruction method then assumes that there is a single function ( map ) @xmath17 that describes the dynamics all over , @xmath18    embedding theorems@xcite guarantee that for sufficiently large @xmath15 there is a diffeomorphism between the physical phase - space and the reconstruction space ( the latter is then called an embedding space , _ stricto sensu _ ) . following giona _",
    "et al._@xcite and brown@xcite we assume that the function @xmath19 is of a multivariate polynomial form , @xmath20 where the sum runs over all polynomials up to degree @xmath21 .",
    "more specifically we use natural polynomials , i.e. polynomials that are constructed to be orthogonal on the data set .",
    "however , instead of constructing these polynomials explicitly by recursion and then determining the coefficients @xmath22 @xcite it is equivalent and much faster to expand the function in terms of all monomials up to the same order @xmath21 @xmath23 and then find the expansion coefficients @xmath24 through a least squares minimization of the variance @xmath25 for this purpose a svd ( singular value decomposition ) approach has been found to be most stable and efficient.@xcite    the global polynomial reconstruction method was first tested@xcite on the rssler attractor.@xcite using as input a short time - series of only the first one of the 3 rssler variables one obtains a very good estimation of the lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimension of the attractor .",
    "furthermore it is possible to determine that this scalar signal was generated by a 3-d flow ( rssler s three first order odes ) , in other words it is possible to determine not only the lowest embedding dimension , but also the dimension of the actual physical phase - space of the dynamics .    encouraged by these benchmark results",
    "we have applied the reconstruction method to the observational data of stellar lightcurves shown in figs .  2 and 3 .    because the observational data sets are so small we have used all the points in constructing the map in eq .",
    "we note in passing that in astronomy we are not interested in prediction , but rather in uncovering the properties of the dynamics that underlies the pulsation . in fig .",
    "6 we display the behavior of the error as a function of @xmath15 , which therefore is an in - sample error .",
    "the vertically stacked points are for values of @xmath21 ranging from 3 to 6 .",
    "this suggests strongly that for r  sct the minimum embedding dimension is @xmath26 . for ac",
    "her , because of the much larger observational noise , the lowest achievable error level is seen to be much higher .",
    "nevertheless fig .",
    "6 can be seen to indicate that we may get away with a minimum @xmath15 of 3 .",
    "the behavior of the error norm with dimension by itself is of course insufficient to establish the minimum embedding dimension .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the results obtained with the false nearest neighbor method@xcite are consistent with these respective minimum dimensions of 4 and 3 .",
    "how do we decide that a map is good ?",
    "for that we have to compare the synthetic signals that a map yields to the original data .",
    "( by synthetic signal we mean data that have been generated by iteration from some seed values with a map generated according to eq .  7 ) . of course , since we have chaotic behavior this comparison has to be done in an average or statistical sense .",
    "unfortunately the observational data set is too small to make statistical comparison tests very meaningful .",
    "instead we rely on three rather _ ad hoc _ criteria , _ viz . _",
    "( a ) the signals must have the same appearance , ( b ) their fourier spectra must have the same envelope structure and ( c ) their lowest bk projections should be similar .",
    "we have found these simple criteria to be quite useful .",
    "for example in our flow reconstructions it is quite clear that any 3d maps for r  sct can be rejected for not being able to capture the dynamics of the star ; the synthetic lightcurves , while they may be chaotic , they bear essentially no resemblance to the observational data .    in figs .  2 and 3 , bottom rows , we exhibit the synthetic signals we could produce from what we consider the best of these maps for r  sct and ac  her , respectively . in the bk projections of fig .  6 we display the same two signals , cols .  2 and 7 , respectively . for comparison",
    "we also show synthetic signals for r  sct that were obtained with a 5d map ( col .  3 ) .",
    "6 shows a 3d reconstruction of ac  her . for a comparison of the fourier spectra",
    "we refer to the original papers .    for further details concerning the sensitivity to the delay @xmath27",
    ", the maximum polynomial order @xmath21 and the data preparation can be found in the original papers.@xcite    the reconstructions are seen to be very good and robust for r  sct .",
    "col .  4 of fig .",
    "6 shows that this remains true when we reconstruct the dynamics with a 4d flow instead of the 4d map of col .  2 .",
    "the ac  her data are inferior .",
    "their signal to noise ratio is much lower and as a result the reconstruction is much less robust .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting that we are able to reconstruct a map that can produce synthetic signals with similar properties to the observational data .",
    "it is not possible to extract lyapunov exponents and a fractal dimension directly form the observational data because of their short length .",
    "however we can obtain these quantities once we have constructed the map or flow . in table 1",
    "we show the lyapunov exponents @xmath28 , ordered from largest to smallest , and of the lyapunov dimension @xmath29 for some of the reconstructions for both r  sct and ac  her .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the largest value such that the sum is positive .",
    "the coefficients have been obtained from the maps that have been constructed with the listed parameters @xmath15 , @xmath27 and @xmath21 .",

    "we only note the most important points : ( 1 ) while there is some scatter in the exponents and in the associated fractal dimension @xmath29 , for all successful reconstructions @xmath38 for r  sct and 3 for ac  her , independently of the embedding dimension .",
    "this is an indication that we have achieved an embedding of the dynamics .",
    "( 2 ) the largest of the lyapunov exponents is always positive .",
    "this is a confirmation that the signal is indeed chaotic .",
    "( 3 ) we have not shown the second lyapunov exponent because it is always close to zero .",
    "this result is reassuring , because it indicates that we are actually close to describing a flow for which one of the exponents would be exactly zero ( autonomous system ) .",
    "( 4 ) for r  sct @xmath39 , whereas the inequality is reversed for ac  her , indicating a larger dissipation in the dynamics of ac  her .",
    "as physicists we would like to infer more than just lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions , because as such they are not very useful .",
    "thus it is interesting that from the linearization of the r  sct map about its fixed point we found@xcite two spiral roots , one unstable and the second stable with approximately twice the frequency .",
    "this led to the interesting physical interpretation that the chaotic dynamics is generated by the nonlinear interaction of two radial modes of pulsation that are in a close resonance condition .",
    "such a physical picture is supported by further theoretical considerations.@xcite as for ac  her , it is quite likely that two strongly interacting vibrational modes also underlie this dynamics , but that the stronger dissipation alluded to just above compresses the dynamics down to 3d , in the same way the 2d hnon map shrinks to a 1d logistic map for small values of @xmath40 .",

    "however , numerical hydrodynamical simulations and their analysis with the global flow reconstruction@xcite indicate also a 3-d phase - space and a fractal dimension of @xmath43 2.01  2.05 .",
    "a systematic trend seems to exist , _ viz . _ that as we go from the low luminosity , weakly irregular w  vir stars to the high luminosity , strongly irregular rv  tau stars , the fractal dimension gradually increases .",
    "the fact that these stars have such a low dimensional dynamics must be considered remarkable .",
