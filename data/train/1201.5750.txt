    "it is common knowledge that newton s gravitational law is not tested experimentally with sufficient precision at separations below 0.1 mm .",
    "the smaller is the separation between the test bodies , the greater is the correction to newtonian gravity allowed by the experimental data .",
    "for instance , at separation of @xmath0 m the existence of a `` correction '' that is nine orders of magnitude larger than the magnitude of newton s potential is not excluded experimentally .",
    "so large addition scarcely can be called a correction . because of this it is conventional to speak about non - newtonian gravity.@xcite    the most offen discussed non - newtonian gravity is of yukawa - type . in this case the complete gravitational potential , including both the newtonian and non - newtonian contributions takes the form@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the masses of two pointlike bodies separated by a distance @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the newtonian gravitational constant and @xmath6 are the interaction constant and interaction range of the additional force , respectively .",
    "modern physics provides two main reasons why the non - newtonian gravity of yukawa - type should arise .",
    "the first of them is the exchange of light elementary particles between separate atoms of two macrobodies .",
    "many particles , such as , scalar axion,@xcite graviphoton,@xcite dilaton,@xcite goldstino,@xcite and moduli,@xcite among others , are predicted in different extensions of the standard model .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) . at the present time",
    "light elementary particles are regarded as possible constituents of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "another prediction of yukawa - type additions to newton s gravitational law comes from extra - dimensional theories with low - energy compactification scale.@xcite@xcite according to these theories the compactification energy may be as low as the extra - dimensional planck energy @xmath8 here @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the number of extra dimensions compactified at some small length @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the gravitational constant in the extended @xmath13-dimensional space - time and @xmath14 . when @xmath15 one obtains from ( [ eq2 ] ) the usual planck energy @xmath16gev . the characteristic size of the @xmath10-dimensional manifold is given by@xcite @xmath17^{\\frac{2}{n}}\\sim 10^{\\frac{32 - 17n}{n}}\\,\\mbox{cm}. \\label{eq3}\\ ] ]    the presence of extra dimensions modifies the standard newton potential",
    "thus , at separations @xmath18 the resulting gravitational potential takes the form ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "it is pertinent to compare the theoretical prediction ( [ eq3 ] ) with available experimental data .",
    "thus , for @xmath19 eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) leads to @xmath20 cm .",
    "such a large extra dimension is excluded by solar system tests of newtonian gravitational law.@xcite for @xmath21 and 3 the sizes of extra dimensions are @xmath22 mm and @xmath23 nm , respectively . keeping in mind that @xmath24 , these predictions fall within the range where constraints on non - newtonian gravity are not so stringent",
    ".    constraints on the yukawa - type corrections to newton s law were traditionally obtained from the etvos- and cavendish - type experiments . for this purpose the yukawa interaction energy and force between two test bodies separated by a distance @xmath25 were obtained by integration of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) over their volumes and subsequent negative differentiation with respect to @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the matter densities .",
    "the obtained constraints are discussed in detail in the literature.@xcite the strength of these constraints decreases with decreasing @xmath28 .",

    "m the strongest constraints on the yukawa - type interactions follow from measurements of the casimir force@xcite which becomes the dominant background force at short separations between the test bodies .",
    "note that the possibility to constrain the non - newtonian gravity from measurements of the van der waals and casimir forces was proposed long ago for the yukawa@xcite and power - type@xcite corrections to newton s law .",
    "a review of constraints on the yukawa - type interactions from the casimir effect obtained up to 2009 is available.@xcite    in this paper we review new constraints on non - newtonian gravity obtained from measurements of the casimir force during the last two years . during this period",
    "a major progress was achieved .",

    "here we remind the methodology on how constraints on the yukawa interactions are obtained from measurements of the normal casimir force ( i.e. , acting in the normal direction to the surface ) .",
    "we also present the constraints obtained up to 2009 to be compared with stronger and ( or ) more recent constraints . as the first such constraint we discuss the one obtained@xcite from new torsion pendulum experiment.@xcite    the measured quantities are the casimir force @xmath35 in a sphere - plate geometry ( experiment using an atomic force microscope@xcite ) and its gradient @xmath36 ( experiment using a micromachined oscillator@xcite ) .",
    "the high - confidence constraints determined at a 95% confidence level are obtained from the inequalities @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the yukawa force between a sphere ( or a spherical lens ) and a plate calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the half - width of the confidence interval for the difference between theoretical and measured casimir force ( force gradient ) determined at a 95% confidence level .",
    "the confidence intervals should not be confused with the force residuals , i.e. , the differences between the computed and measured forces ( although at least 95% of force residuals belong to the confidence intervals ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the meaning of absolute errors .",
    "because of this , they can be determined with only two or three significant figures independently of their values , i.e. , with the relative error of about 0.5% . from this",
    "it follows that the yukawa force @xmath38 needs not be calculated with a higher precision ( even if the measurement of the casimir force was more precise ) .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the yukawa force in sphere - plate geometry can be calculated both precisely by eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and using the simplified formulation of the proximity force approximation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the sphere radius and @xmath43 is the yukawa energy per unit area in the configuration of two parallel plates . with the experimental parameters used@xcite the results of both calculations coincide.@xcite    it was claimed@xcite that one and the same experiment can not be used simultaneously to exclude or confirm some theory of the casimir force and to place constraints on the yukawa force from the measure of agreement between experiment and theory",
    "this opinion would be warranted only if the difference between the excluded and confirmed theories of the casimir force can be modeled by the yukawa force .",
    "this is , however , not so in all experiments discussed here .",
    "therefore , it became a common practice in the literature to compare the measured data with different theories and , after a selection of the theory in agreement with the data is made , to obtain constraints on the yukawa interaction .    in fig .  1 we present constraints on the parameters of yukawa - type interaction @xmath44 following@xcite from measurements of the normal casimir force between au surfaces by means of an afm@xcite ( line 1 ) , from measuring the gradient of the casimir force between similar surfaces ( or , equivalently , the casimir pressure between two au - coated parallel plates ) by means of a micromachined oscillator@xcite ( line 2 ) , and from the casimir - less experiment,@xcite@xcite where the contribution of the casimir force was made equal to zero ( line 3 ) .",
    "the constraints for larger @xmath28 were obtained@xcite from the torsion - pendulum experiment@xcite of 1997 ( line 4 ) .",
    "the constraints from the torsion - pendulum experiment@xcite of 2009 are shown by the line 5 . the dashed line 6 in fig .",
    "1 shows the constraints following from the gravitational experiment of cavendish - type@xcite which leads to the strongest constraints in this interaction range . at larger @xmath28",
    "all the strongest constraints follow from the gravitational experiments as discussed in sec .  1 .",
    "in this and in all other figures below , the allowed values of @xmath28 and @xmath30 in the @xmath44-plane lie beneath the respective lines .",
    "now let us begin the consideration of new information concerning the constraints shown in fig .  1 obtained in the last two years .",
    "we start with the constraints@xcite obtained from the measurement data of recent torsion - pendulum experiment,@xcite which is similar to previous experiments using the torsion pendulum,@xcite but arrives at quite different conclusions .",
    "this experiment was performed in the geometry of a spherical lens of @xmath45 cm radius of curvature near a plate , both coated with au .",
    "the total force of nonestablished origin ( presumably caused by large electrostatic patches ) between the lens and the plate was up to a factor of 10 larger than the casimir force even when the residual electric force was compensated .",
    "this total force was measured over a wide range of separations from 0.7 to @xmath46 m .",
    "the casimir force was extracted using the fitting procedure with two fitting parameters .",
    "it was found in agreement with the drude model and in contradiction with the plasma model ( contrary to the results of the previous torsion - pendulum experiments@xcite and experiments using a micromachined oscillator@xcite ) .",
    "the constraints obtained@xcite are shown in fig .  2 by the line 4a . the lines 3 , 4 , and 6 are the same , as explained in the caption of fig .  1 and respective discussion in the text .",
    "specifically , line 4 shows the constraints obtained@xcite from the first torsion - pendulum experiment.@xcite    the major problem of the recent torsion - pendulum experiment@xcite is that at separations above @xmath47 m the casimir force obtained after the subtraction agrees much better not with the drude model , as claimed , but with the plasma model.@xcite as to separations below @xmath47 m , the results of ref .",
    "were shown to be not reliable because of imperfections invariably present on surfaces of large lenses which were not taken into account.@xcite as can be seen in fig .  2 , the constraints shown by the lines 4 and 4a are almost of the same strength in spite of the fact that they follow from the two experiments in mutual contradiction .",
    "in any case it should be concluded that all constraints following from the torsion - pendulum experiments using large glass lenses ( lines 4 and 5 in fig .  1 and lines 4 and 4a in fig",
    ".  2 ) are lacking reliability due to the problems indicated in ref .  .",
    "they are not as reliable as the constraints shown by the lines 13 which are deternimed at a 95% confidence level .",
    "these constraints on the yukawa - type interaction were obtained@xcite from the results of experiment@xcite measuring the gradient of the normal casimir force between an au - coated sphere above a si plate covered with corrugations of trapezoidal shape ( see also ref .  ) .",

    "the constraints of line 7 are weaker by a factor of 2.4 .",
    "the reason is that the density of si is smaller that the density of au deposited on both test bodies in the respective experiments.@xcite@xcite it is pertinent to note , however , that line 7 in fig .",
    "3(b ) is in a very good qualitative agreement with lines 2 and 3 and , thus , provides confirmation to previously obtained constraints .",
    "in fact this experiment alone covers the interaction ranges of two previously performed experiments . if the material of the corrugated plate ( si ) were replaced by au , stronger by a factor 8.3 constraints than those shown by line 7 would be obtained ( see sec .  7 where the possibilities to obtain stronger constraints are discussed ) .",
    "the lateral casimir force acting between the sinusoidally corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a plate has long been demonstrated and the measurement data were compared with the theory using the pfa.@xcite recently more precise measurements of the lateral force were performed and compared with the exact scattering theory.@xcite the measure of agreement between the data and theoretical predictions was used@xcite to obtain stronger constraints on the yukawa - type interaction . for this purpose the lateral yukawa force was calculated in the configuration of a sinusoidally corrugated sphere above a sinusoidally corrugated plate , both coated with au .",
    "the period @xmath65 of corrugations on both surfaces was common , but the corrugation amplitudes @xmath66 and @xmath67 were different .",
