    "the standard model ( sm ) is most likely an effective theory up to some scale @xmath1 , above which new physics has to be taken into account .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses requires an extension of the sm , which may involve right - handed neutrinos or other new fields .",
    "introducing right - handed neutrinos allows dirac masses @xmath2 via yukawa couplings analogous to the quark sector . in general ,",
    "lepton number need not be conserved , so that majorana masses are possible . for left - handed neutrinos this can , for example , be achieved with higgs triplets .",
    "right - handed neutrinos can have explicit majorana masses @xmath3 of order @xmath1 , since they are gauge singlets and since there are no protective symmetries .",
    "this leads to a picture with zero or tiny left - handed majorana masses @xmath4 , with @xmath2 similar to the charged lepton masses , and with a huge @xmath3 .",
    "diagonalization of the neutrino mass matrix results in majorana fermions and eigenvalues @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for @xmath7 the neutrino masses",
    "are thus given by the see - saw relation @xmath8 @xcite , which provides a convincing explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "another , less model dependent approach is to study the effective field theory with higher dimensional operators of sm fields . if lepton number is not conserved , some of these generate majorana neutrino masses .",
    "the lowest dimensional operator of this kind has dimension 5 and couples two lepton and two higgs doublets .",
    "it appears e.g. in the see - saw mechanism by integrating out the heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "as quarks have only small mixings , it is somewhat surprising that neutrinos most likely have two large mixing angles @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate mechanisms which can produce such large or maximal mixings .",
    "these mechanisms operate , however , typically at the embedding scale @xmath1 . for a comparison of experimental results with high energy predictions from unified theories , it is thus essential to evolve the predictions to low energies with the relevant renormalization group equations ( rge s ) .",
    "this evolution is related to the running of the leading dimension 5 operator .",
