    "i will also discuss some recent works on symplectic geometry of finite dimensional completely integrable hamiltonian systems by the author and v ngc @xcite because they are central to the spectral theory .",
    "these papers contain classification results for the so called completely integrable hamiltonian systems of _ semitoric type _ , and are in the spirit of the seminal papers of atiyah @xcite , guillemin - sternberg @xcite , and delzant @xcite on toric systems .    in this paper",
    "we are going to emphasize the connection of symplectic geometry with spectral theory and microlocal analysis ( see guillemin - sternberg  @xcite and zworski  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the development of semiclassical microlocal analysis in the past four decades now allows a fruitful interplay between symplectic geometry ( classical mechanics ) and spectral theory ( quantum mechanics ) .",
    "the literature on these subjects is vast and i refer to the aforementioned papers for a more comprehensive list of references .",

    "symplectic form_. for instance , we can take @xmath3 to be a surface , and @xmath5 to be an area form on it ( in dimension @xmath4 , a symplectic form is the same as an area form ) .",
    "another typical example is @xmath6 equipped with coordinates @xmath7 and symplectic form @xmath8 the cotangent bundle of any compact smooth manifold is also a symplectic manifold in a natural way .",
    "symplectic manifolds are even - dimensional ( because the symplectic form is non - degenerate ) and orientable ( because @xmath9 is a volume form ) .",
    "let s write @xmath10 for the dimension of @xmath3 .",

    "while there are a few results on symplectic theory of integrable systems , the subject is largely not understood , we refer to @xcite for a more extensive discussion .",
    "in particular , @xcite aims to give a more comprehensive description of the current state of the art of the symplectic theory of integrable systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that features about the symplectic geometry of singularities can be detected using spectral theory , see for instance @xcite , where this is done for some of the singularities of the coupled spin - oscillator .",
    "the self - adjoint operators @xmath25 on a hilbert space are mutually commuting if their spectral measures @xmath26 pairwise commute .",

    "this classification appeared in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , these invariants are as follows : an integer @xmath177 counting the number of isolated singularities , a collection of taylor series classifying symplectically a saturated neighborhood of the singular fiber corresponding to these sigularities , a family of rational convex polygons @xmath178 which is constructed from the image @xmath179 of the system by performing a very precise  cutting \" ( the @xmath180 s are vertical lines cutting @xmath181 with orientations @xmath182 ) , an invariant measuring the volumes of certain submanifolds meeting at each of the isolated singularities , and , finally , a collection of integers measuring how twisted the lagrangian fibration of the system is around the singularities .",
