    "an important part of the hadron physics project is devoted to extend the sis / gsi program for the in - medium modification of hadrons to the heavy quark sector providing a first insight into charm - nucleus interaction .",
    "thus , the possible modifications of the properties of open and hidden charm mesons in a hot and dense environment are matter of recent studies .",

    "moreover , changes in the properties of open charm mesons will affect the renormalization of charm and hidden charm scalar meson resonances in nuclear matter , providing information about their nature , whether they are @xmath9 states , molecules , mixtures of @xmath9 with meson - meson components , or dynamically generated resonances resulting from the interaction of two pseudoscalars .    in the present article , we present a study of the properties of strange and charm mesons in hot and dense matter within a self - consistent approach in coupled channels for the conditions expected at cbm / fair .",
    "we analyze the behaviour of dynamically generated baryonic resonances as well as the strange and charm meson spectral functions in this hot and dense medium .",
    "we then test our results for strange mesons using energy - weighted sum rules and analyze the effect of the self - energy of @xmath6 mesons on dynamically - generated charm and hidden charm scalar resonances .",

    "<S> the in - medium solution at finite temperature accounts for pauli blocking effects , mean - field binding of all the baryons involved , and meson self - energies . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the behaviour in this hot and dense environment of dynamically - generated baryonic resonances together with the evolution with density and temperature of the strange and open - charm meson spectral functions . </S>",
    "<S> we test the spectral functions for strange mesons using energy - weighted sum rules and finally discuss the implications of the properties of charm mesons on the @xmath0 and the predicted @xmath1 scalar resonances . </S>"
