    "solid water is a very abundant material .",
    "indeed , it is believed to be the most abundant condensed material in the universe , thanks to its propensity for remaining as a deposit on interstellar dust particles in dense clouds .",
    "amorphous solid water ice , together with a wealth of other condensed species , is widely observed spectroscopically via infra - red absorption lines present in the spectrum of a field star or of the embedded object in star forming regions @xcite .",
    "icy mantles covering dust grains are reputed to form after direct freeze out of gas phase species and after surface reactions of atoms and radicals .",
    "although water ice is by far the most abundant species in icy mantles , the chemical origin of water molecules in interstellar icy mantles is still uncertain .",
    "water molecule formation in the gas phase is not efficient enough to reproduce the observed abundances in dark clouds , especially in its solid form @xcite .",
    "therefore , water ice is likely to form directly on the cold interstellar grains and not as a condensate after formation in the gas phase .",
    "a reaction scheme including water formation on grain surfaces was proposed some years ago by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that h@xmath2o formation would be initiated by h - atoms reacting with o , o@xmath2 and o@xmath3 , although the o@xmath3  +  h pathway was considered to be the most effective and o@xmath2 would play a mere catalytic role .",
    "nonetheless , o@xmath1 and o@xmath0 molecules have not so far been detected in interstellar ices on dust grains , although their presence is presumed .",
    "ozone non - detection may be partly explained because its strongest @xmath4 ( o - o ) vibrational transition band at 1040 @xmath5 ( 9.6 @xmath6 m ) is swamped by the strong infrared absorption band of silicates at 10  @xmath6 m which has been observed by iso ( infrared space observatory ) in the 2.4 - 25 @xmath6 m region ( e.g. , spectrum toward the protostar w33a , resolution @xmath7  500 - 1000 , * ? ? ?",
    "astrochemical models of dark clouds predict that condensed oxygen is likely to be a major component of apolar dust grains within interstellar clouds at 10  k. recently , the o  +  h pathway @xcite and the o@xmath1  +  h pathway @xcite have been explored experimentally .",
    "all these experiments show that these reactions lead to water formation , even though the efficiencies of intermediate reactions are still under debate . besides o and o@xmath1 , ozone",
    "too can be present in icy mantles chemically processed by irradiation from galactic cosmic - ray particles and internal secondary uv field @xcite .",
    "several laboratory works confirm the efficient production of o@xmath0 following energetic electron irradiation of pure oxygen ices @xcite , and uv , proton and ion irradiation of ice mixtures simulating realistic analogues of interstellar ices @xcite . in solid phase , o@xmath1 and co@xmath1",
    "are easily dissociated by uv radiations ( @xmath8  nm ) and cosmic rays  ( c.r . ) producing atomic o in the electronic ground state ( @xmath9p ) and in the first electronically excited ( @xmath10d ) state @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 in the interstellar grain mantles , the o(@xmath9p ) atoms in the ground state , which are in thermal equilibrium with the ice surface , react with o@xmath1 molecules to form o@xmath0 via the following reaction pathway : @xmath13 the formation of ozone via equation ( 3 ) is exothermic ( @xmath14  ev ) .",
    "while the main ozone destruction reactions are : @xmath15 @xmath16 in addition , in dark clouds hydrogen is mainly in its molecular form so h - atoms are a rather rare reactant with h / h@xmath17 @xmath18 @xcite . the number density of h - atoms is mostly governed by the destruction of h@xmath17 due to cosmic rays .",
    "this value , whatever the density of the cloud , is about 1  @xmath19 .",
    "the o / h@xmath17 ratio remains approximately constant ( 10@xmath20 ) , thus the number of atomic o , unlike h , is proportional to the density of the cloud .",
    "see , for example , table  1 of @xcite ; for a cloud density of 10@xmath21  @xmath19 the h / o ratio is @xmath22 while for a denser cloud with a density of 10@xmath23  @xmath19 the h / o ratio is @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , for very dense clouds , o is the most abundant species in atomic form and it can accrete on grains and subsequently form o@xmath1 and o@xmath0 .    in their model , using a monte carlo approach , @xcite showed that under dense cloud conditions the ( o@xmath0  +  h ) pathway is the most efficient route leading to the formation of h@xmath1o .",
    "finally , it should be noted that , in the diverse models , some barriers can be raised in order to increase one of the competitive reactions @xcite . yet",
    ", such barriers can only be experimentally probed , because extrapolations from the gaseous data are quite uncertain .",
    "this letter is the first report of water formation via ozone hydrogenation in the series of recent experiments that aim to investigate water synthesis in the ism .",
    "we present the evidence for the formation of water molecules from the reaction of o@xmath0 with d - atoms on non - porous amorphous solid water ice under conditions relevant to the dense interstellar clouds .",
    "our experiments were performed using the formolism set - up developed to study the reaction and the interaction of atoms and molecules on surfaces simulating dust grains under interstellar conditions .",
    "the apparatus is composed of an ultrahigh - vacuum chamber with a base operating pressure of around 10@xmath25 mbar .",
    "the sample holder , a copper cylinder block , is attached to the cold finger of a closed - cycle he cryostat .",
    "it can be cooled to 8  k. the temperature of the sample is measured using a calibrated silicon diode and a thermocouple ( cromel - aufe ) clamped on the back of the sample holder .",
    "the copper surface is covered with 100 layers of non - porous amorphous solid water ( np - asw ) by condensation of water vapor on the cold sample maintained at 120  k. water is sprayed through a microchannel array doser located 2  cm in front of the surface .",
    "this ice is amorphous but non porous @xcite .",
    "the water ice substrate is then cooled to 10  k. more details can be obtained in @xcite .",
    "ozone can be synthesized by two methods .",
    "one is an ex - situ method : o@xmath0 is prepared from gaseous o@xmath1 introduced in a glass bottle at a pressure of about 30  mbar .",
    "the o@xmath1 gas is then excited by a radiofrequency electric discharge ( @xmath7  2  mhz ) through a copper coil placed around the o@xmath1 container .",
    "the blue ozone gas produced by the recombination of o@xmath1 and o atoms during the discharge is condensed on the bottom wall plunged in liquid nitrogen ( 77  k ) .",
    "residual o@xmath1 is then removed by primary pumping .",
    "the glass bottle is then mounted onto the main set - up .",
    "ozone is introduced into the vacuum chamber via a triply differentially pumped beam line aimed at the cold surface covered with h@xmath1o ice . due to the metallic parts of the inlet system",
    "on which o@xmath0 in part dissociates , the beam is composed of 70  % ozone and 30  % o@xmath1 . however , o@xmath1 is easily removed from the surface when the sample is held at 50  k. by varying the exposure time of the ozone beam , it is possible to vary the initial coverage of the surface .",
    "the o@xmath0 flux was previously calibrated using temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) by determining the exposure time of a pure o@xmath1 beam required to saturate the o@xmath1 monolayer ( 1  monolayer = 10@xmath26 molecules  @xmath27 ) on np - asw ice . in the experiments described below we have deposited a maximum of half a monolayer of ozone under the same beam conditions used for calibrating the o@xmath1 flux .",
    "owing to the non - pure o@xmath0 beam , however , ozone exposures had a relative accuracy of @xmath7  20  % and an absolute accuracy of @xmath7  30  % .",
    "nevertheless , we did not see any significant effect due to the initial coverage ( between 0.1 and 0.5 monolayers  @xmath28 ) .",
    "an alternative technique of ozone production was also used , namely by depositing an atomic o on top of an o@xmath1 layer pre - adsorbed on the surface and then producing ozone in - situ .",
    "the disadvantage of this technique is that the control of the initial amount of ozone have to be checked after each exposure .",
    "whichever technique was used to deposit ozone onto the surface , we obtained the same final results .    after depositing ozone ,",
    "an atomic d - beam aimed at the surface of the sample irradiates the o@xmath0-h@xmath1o film maintained at 10  k. the d - atoms are produced by the dissociation of d@xmath1 molecules in a quartz tube using a surfatron microwave discharge at 2.45  ghz .",
    "the rate of dissociation is @xmath7 60  % .",
    "after the irradiation of @xmath29 d - atoms  @xmath27 , a tpd is performed up to 180  k so that all the water ice desorbs .",
    "the tpd heating rate is 10 k / min from 10 to 180  k. the desorbed species are detected using a quadruple mass spectrometer ( qms ) .",
    "the spectrum ( a ) in figure  [ fig1 ] shows the tpd curve of mass  32 obtained after the exposure of half a layer of o@xmath0 on a np - asw substrate held at 10  k ( ex - situ synthesis ) .",
    "we observe two peaks : the desorption peak at low temperature ( @xmath7  30  k ) represents the desorption of o@xmath1 molecules .",
    "these molecules have been deposited by the o@xmath1 fraction in the o@xmath0 beam , probably due to ozone destruction on the metallic walls of the gas inlet system .",
    "the high - temperature peak at @xmath7  60  k is the desorption of ozone .",
    "mass 48 of o@xmath0 is also simultaneously detected in smaller amount and is always proportional to the signal at mass 32 .",
    "in fact , for the most part o@xmath30 fragments are detected , as a result of the o@xmath0 cracking in the head of the qms .",
    "also , the desorption of ozone from asw surfaces is known to occur at around 60  k @xcite .",
    "although this may be seen as an indirect measure , mass  32 gives information about o@xmath1 ( below 50  k ) and o@xmath0 ( above 50  k ) desorption .",
    "as shown in the spectrum ( a ) of fig .  1 , o@xmath0 desorption is about three times larger than that of o@xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that the ozone fraction deposited with the ex - situ method is @xmath7  70  % , the rest being o@xmath1 molecules . in order to deposit only ozone molecules on the cold surface",
    ", we performed the exposure step with the water ice substrate held at 50  k. thus o@xmath1 molecules desorbing at 30  k were eliminated .",
    "then we cooled the sample to 10  k before proceeding with the tpd .",
    "as shown in the spectrum ( b ) of fig .  1 , the tpd peak observed comes from o@xmath0 desorbing at 60  k. by using these procedures , we are sure that at 10  k only reactions involving ozone and d - atoms will occur .    for this work , we performed a set of experiments with various d - atom exposures . in the first one , d - atoms were sent onto the ozone - free water ice surface to check that no reaction occurred between d and the h@xmath1o substrate to produce deuterated water molecules .",
    "this result is displayed in the mass  19 spectrum ( b ) of fig .",
    "2 . there is neither hdo nor d@xmath1o desorption peak when d - atoms alone are deposited on the asw ice substrate at 10  k as was previously noticed by @xcite and @xcite .    in a second experiment we exposed the np - asw sample held at 10  k to d - atoms before ozone deposition . in this experiment ozone",
    "desorbs as if no atoms had been sent to the surface .",
    "this is because d - atoms form promptly d@xmath1 on non - porous water ice ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and apparently because ozone does not react with d@xmath1 ( see below ) .",
    "this proves that hydrogenation reactions take place at around 10  k and not at higher temperatures since d - atoms react promptly at 10  k and furthermore they will have completely desorbed above 13  k @xcite .",
    "in another experiment , d - atoms were sent onto the np - asw surface previously exposed to 0.5 monolayers of o@xmath0 . in the spectrum ( c ) of figure  1",
    "we firstly observe the disappearance of the o@xmath0 peak .",
    "this suggests that all the ozone molecules have reacted .",
    "we also note that the reaction d  +  o@xmath0 is very efficient , because the number of d - atoms sent to the surface is only 10  times the number of o@xmath0 on the surface .",
    "consequently , we can conclude that the d  +  o@xmath0 reaction  which is in competition with the d  +  d reaction in our experiment  proceeds on the ice surface with a small energy barrier .",
    "an estimation of the reaction rate can be made , for example , with the formula used by @xcite to simulate the surface reactions in their model : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the attempt frequency for reaction , @xmath33 the width of the barrier , @xmath6 the reduced mass and @xmath34 the activation barrier . by taking @xmath34/k@xmath35  =  450  k for the d  +  o@xmath0 reaction @xcite",
    ", we found that this reaction is very rapid ( @xmath7  1  ps ) if compared with the diffusion time of d - atoms on an amorphous water ice ( @xmath36  =  @xmath7  10  ms  on porous asw ice , * ? ? ? * ) .    in passing , we would like to point out that , over the last years , we have performed experiments on water formation in space starting from o , o@xmath1 and now o@xmath0 .",
    "even though we can not infer absolute reaction rates which are very hard to estimate we can attempt to make relative comparisons .",
    "it should be noted that the destruction rate of ozone following d exposures is as important as the one for o  +  d and d  +  o@xmath0 reactions within the error bar of our experimental data .",
    "hence we conclude that the d  +  o@xmath0 reaction proceeds without a measurable activation barrier in the solid phase .    obtained subsequently to the d  +  o@xmath0 experiment , the spectrum ( a ) of figure  [ fig2 ] shows a desorption peak of mass  19 at 160  k attributed to the singly deuterated water ( hdo ) .",
    "this clearly indicates that the reaction of d - atoms with o@xmath0 molecules on the ice surface is efficient and produces deuterated water molecules detected upon desorption of the whole ice film .",
    "we also notice that nearly no desorption peak of d@xmath1o ( mass  20 ) is detected .",
    "this is due to thermally activated h / d exchanges during the phase transition of the water ice @xcite .",
    "therefore , even if d@xmath1o is actually formed on the surface , mostly water molecules in the form of hdo are likely to desorb and be detected .",
    "the formation of deuterated water molecules at t@xmath37  = 10  k from d - atoms and o@xmath0 molecules may then follow the successive reaction pathways : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 whereas at t@xmath37 greater than 130  k , as mentioned above , the following isotope exchange reaction is active : @xmath43    of course , the reversal of reaction ( 12 ) is also possible , but in our case it is statistically negligible .    as for what concerns the intermediate products of the reaction scheme , we performed again the d  +  o@xmath0 experiment but with a low exposure of d - atoms ( 0.01 monolayers ) on 0.15 monolayers of o@xmath0 , thus with a dose of d insufficient to go on with the hydrogenation reactions leading to water molecules .",
    "this experiment shows that o@xmath0 molecules are not thoroughly consumed and also that o@xmath1 molecules appear on the surface indicating that reaction ( 7 ) proceeds at 10  k and that the formation of d@xmath1o can proceed as well from the intermediate reaction ( 9 ) .",
    "the studied mechanism for water formation from the hydrogenation of ozone might be an explanation for the non- detection of o@xmath0 in the interstellar ices .",
    "in fact , ozone reacts rapidly with hydrogen atoms to form water molecules on a water ice surface at 10 k and under conditions similar to those found in dense interstellar clouds .",
    "likewise , the lack of a clear detection of o@xmath1 in interstellar ices may be explained by the high reactivity between o@xmath1 and h - atoms reported in miyauchi et al .",
    "2008 , ioppolo et al . 2008 , and matar et al . 2008 .",
    "in addition , the oh  +  h@xmath1 reaction could also be a key surface reaction in dark clouds , because h@xmath1 ( and d@xmath1 ) is present on the surface of the grains in large amounts @xcite . in our experiments too , there is a large amount of molecular deuterium because of the incomplete dissociation of d@xmath1 in the d beam . at the moment",
    "it is not possible to us to probe explicitly the oh  +  h@xmath1 reaction , but we can investigate the role of d@xmath1 , by testing the o@xmath0  +   d@xmath1 reaction . in order to do that ,",
    "we have deposited a very large amount of d@xmath1 ( @xmath7  10@xmath44  @xmath27 ) on np - asw ice held at 10 k and previously dosed with o@xmath0 . in this experiment",
    ", we did not detect any hdo , even when the surface was held at 50  k during d@xmath1 deposition in order to overcome a possible activation barrier .",
    "therefore , we can fairly conclude that the d@xmath1  +  o@xmath0 reaction does not proceed under our experimental conditions .",
    "unlike the o@xmath0  +  d@xmath1 reaction , o@xmath0  +  d shows no barrier under our experimental conditions and this result shows clearly that ozone is a likely precursor to water formation on a water ice layer at 10  k as proposed by @xcite .",
    "this pathway is to be preferred in environments where the number of o atoms exceeds the number of h  atoms , which is supposed to be the case in dark clouds with a density higher than 10@xmath21 @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our present data do not allow us to disentangle the different intermediate reactions that lead to the formation of water . in order to investigate in more detail the kinetics of water formation at 10  k via ozone",
    ", we are developing an additional ir diagnostic on formolism .",
    "this will allow us to see the appearance of some of the intermediate reactants and to provide accurate quantitative results .",
    "in this paper we have shown that it is possible to form efficiently water molecules from the reaction of o@xmath0 with hydrogen atoms on non - porous water ice .",
    "this reaction exhibits no activation barrier at 10  k , and is about as efficient as the pathways having o or o@xmath1 as precursors .",
    "this experimental result corroborates theoretical studies that consider ozone as one of the major actors of water formation in dark clouds .",
