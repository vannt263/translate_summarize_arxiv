    "recently , there has been a considerable interest in cosmological aspects of string theory ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "several methods of producing de sitter ( ds ) vacua in string compactifications were presented . in  @xcite",
    ", it was suggested that various corrections to the supergravity potential energy can raise a supersymmetric anti de sitter ( ads ) vacuum to a metastable ds vacuum . in  @xcite ,",
    "based on the earlier work  @xcite , a ds vacuum was created by balancing various exponential superpotentials and in  @xcite , it was argued that a ds vacuum can be created by taking into account higher order corrections to the moduli kahler potential .",
    "in addition , in  @xcite , it was studied how effects of gravity and quantum particle production could trap moduli at enhanced symmetry points .",
    "furthermore , a substantial progress has been achieved towards inflation in string theory  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "inflation was studied within the context of @xmath0-branes . under certain conditions",
    "the @xmath0-brane modulus can be treated as an inflaton . however , all these models usually have two common problem .",
    "inflation is often realized in compactification or brane world scenarios which do not correspond to realistic four - dimensional physics .",
    "the other problem is that , in addition to the inflaton , there are , usually , other moduli whose stabilization could be a problem and whose presence can violate the slow roll conditions .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to explore the possibility of creating an inflationary potential within the framework of strongly coupled heterotic string theory , or hetorotic m - theory  @xcite .",
    "such compactifications have a lot of attractive phenomenological features ( see  @xcite for a review on phenomenological aspects of m - theory ) .",
    "various gut- and standard model - like theories were obtained from heterotic compactifications on calabi - yau threefold  @xcite .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , vector bundles on calabi - yau manifolds with @xmath1 homotopy group were constructed .",
    "a compactification on such a manifold can lead to the standard model with suppressed nucleon decay .",
    "the actual particle spectrum in such theories was studied in  @xcite .",
    "one more attractive feature of such compactifications is that it is possible to stabilize moduli in a phenomenologically acceptable range  @xcite .",
    "the set of moduli considered in  @xcite was very general .",
    "nevertheless , it was not complete . in  @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the calabi - yau threefold had enough isolated genus zero curves to stabilize all @xmath2 moduli .",
    "it was also assumed that the five - branes in the bulk wrapped only isolated genus zero curves . even though such compactifications can certainly exist , a generic compactification with @xmath2 greater than one contains various , not necessarily isolated genus zero , cycles as well five - branes wrapped on them . in this case",
    ", it is quite possible that not all @xmath2 moduli can be stabilized by methods presented in  @xcite .",
    "the moduli of a five - brane wrapped on a non - isolated genus zero curve or a higher genus curve can not be stabilized by methods of  @xcite either . in this paper , we add these new moduli . we show that this new additional @xmath2 moduli can be stabilized in a supersymmetric ads minimum by the slight modification of ideas of  @xcite .",
    "the five - brane moduli can not be stabilized this way .",
    "surprisingly , we find that they can be stabilized in a non - supersymmetric ads minimum .",
    "of course , what we really mean by this is that the system of moduli containing the moduli of this new five - brane admits a non - supersymmetric ads vacuum .",
    "however , the potential energy has one more minimum when the five - brane coincides with the visible brane .",
    "a heterotic m - theory vacuum can contain several five - branes wrapped on non - isolated genus zero or higher genus curves .",
    "those which are located relatively far away from the visible brane will be stabilized . on the other hand ,",
    "those which are located close enough to the visible brane will roll towards it and , eventually , collide with it .",
    "we show that these five - branes can be stabilized as well by balancing the supergravity potential energy against the fayet - iliopoulos terms  @xcite induced by an anomalous @xmath3 gauge group in the hidden sector .",
    "this shows that the most general set of heterotic m - theory moduli can be stabilized .",
    "furthermore , the cosmological constant can be positive and fine tuned to be very small . by balancing the supergravity potential energy against fayet - iliopoulos terms , it is also possible to create a positive potential satisfying the slow roll conditions and treat the five - brane translational modulus as an inflaton .",
    "iflation takes place when the five - brane approaches the visible brane .",
    "however , this potential has one negative feature .",
    "it has a vanishing first derivative when the five - brane coincides with the visible brane .",
    "this means that it takes infinite time for the branes to collide .",
    "this also means that the primordial fluctuations will become infinite . on the other hand , at very short distances , one can not trust the low - energy field theory because new states are expected to become massless . at the present time , physics at short distances in heterotic m - theory is not known . nevertheless , we present an argument how these new state can terminate inflation before the fluctuations became too big .",
    "once the five - brane hits the visible brane , it gets dissolved into it and turns into new moduli of the vector bundle , so called transition moduli , studied in  @xcite .",
    "this process is called small instanton transition  @xcite .",
    "thus , the post - inflationary phase does not have the inflaton but has extra moduli of the vector bundle .",
    "these moduli are easier to stabilize  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the new system of moduli can be stabilized , whereas during inflation this was not the case .",
    "in addition , we argue that , after a small instanton transition , generically , the cosmological constant changes .",
    "it is possible to decrease the cosmological constant and , by fine tuning , make it consistent with observations .",
    "let us point out that , though , besides the inflaton , there are various other moduli during inflation , they are all taken into account .",
    "the potential energy has a minimum in all the other directions .",
    "therefore , dynamically , one expects that all these moduli will roll very fast in their minimum leaving the five - brane to roll slowly towards the visible brane .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the system of moduli in compactifications with @xmath2 greater than one .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , we would like to obtain more general results on moduli stabilization .",
    "in particular , we would like to stabilize the @xmath2 moduli that do not have a non - perturbative superpotentials and , hence , can not be stabilized by methods of  @xcite .",
    "second , before we begin to study potentials for the five - brane , whose stability properties are more complicated , it is important to understand how the remaining moduli of the system are stabilized .",
    "the system of ( complex ) moduli considered in this section includes the complex structure moduli , the volume modulus , two @xmath2 moduli and the moduli of the five - brane wrapped on an isolated genus zero cycle .",
    "one of the two @xmath2 moduli is assumed to be associated with an isolated genus zero curve and , hence , has a non - perturbative superpotential .",
    "the other one is associated with a non - isolated genus zero curve or a higher genus curve .",
    "the non - perturbative superpotential does not depend on this modulus . by the slight modification of ideas of  @xcite",
    ", we show that this system can be stabilized in a supersymmetric ads vacuum .",
    "the crucial moment is that , if @xmath2 is greater that one , it is possible to choose one of the contributions to the tension of the hidden brane to be positive without having the gauge coupling constant stronger in the visible sector . the system of moduli can be supplemented by vector bundle moduli  @xcite .",
    "they can be stabilized as well  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will ignore them . in section 3 , we add one more five - brane to the system .",
    "this five - brane is wrapped on a non - isolated genus zero or higher genus curve .",
    "approximately , we can treat the rest of the moduli fixed and consider an effective potential for the remaining five - brane modulus .",
    "this potential is very difficult to analyze analytically .",
    "a graphical analysis shows that , generically , it has a non - supersymmteric ads minimum .",
    "nevertheless , if a five - brane was originally located close to the visible brane , it will roll towards it . in the rest of the paper , we concentrate only on dynamics of rolling five - branes .",
    "we modify this effective potential with fayet - iliopoulos terms and show that addition of a fayet - iliopoulos term in the hidden sector can stabilize a rolling five - brane .",
    "we also show that the cosmological constant in such a vacuum can be positive and small .",
    "the results from sections 2 and 3 provide stabilization of heterotic moduli in the most general set - up in a vacuum with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "they also indicate that it is conceivable to obtain two distinct ds vacua .",
    "one of them is the lift of the non - supersymmetric ads minimum .",
    "the other one is created by addition of a fayet - iliopoulos term in the hidden sector . in section 4",
    ", we argue that , by balancing the supergravity potential energy and fayet - iliopoulos terms , it is also possible to construct a potential with inflationary properties .",
    "one of the slow roll parameters turns out to be naturally much less than one .",
    "the other one can be ( not necessarily fine ) tuned to be much less than one .",
    "we also discuss the amount of inflation and primordial fluctuations . in the last subsection of section 4 ,",
    "we discuss how the system can escape from inflation at very short distances .",
    "we give a qualitative argument how the appearance of new light states in the field theory can provide such an escape . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the post - inflationary phase .",
    "after inflation , the five - brane hits the visible brane and disappears through a small instanton transition .",
    "the new system of moduli does not contain the five - brane but has extra vector bundle moduli . unlike the five - brane modulus",
    ", these moduli can be stabilized .",
    "we show that the new system of moduli can be stabilized in a vacuum with a positive cosmological constant which can be fine tuned to be very small .",
    "in this paper , we work in the context of strongly coupled heterotic string theory  @xcite compactified on a calabi - yau threefold  @xcite . to one of the orbifold fixed planes we will refer as to the visible brane ( or the visible sector ) . to the other one we will refer as to the hidden brane ( or the hidden sector ) .",
    "such compactifications also allow five - branes wrapped on holomorphic cycles in the calabi - yau manifold and parallel to the orbifold fixed planes .",
    "moduli stabilization in this theory was performed in a relatively general setting in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was assumed in  @xcite that the calabi - yau manifold has enough isolated genus zero curves to stabilize all the @xmath2 and five - brane moduli . in this paper",
    ", we would like to consider a more complicated set - up when the calabi - yau threefold has two - cycles , one represented by isolated genus zero curve and the other one by curves of a different type .",
    "they could be either non - isolated genus zero curves or curves of a higher genus . in both of these two cases , no non - perturbative superpotential for the corresponding @xmath2 modulus",
    "can be generated by string or , more precisely , open membrane instantons  @xcite .",
    "this also means that one can not generate a non - perturbative superpotential for moduli of a five - brane wrapped on such a cycle .",
    "however , compactifications on a calabi - yau manifold with @xmath2 represented only by isolated genus zero cycles are , of course , very restrictive .",
    "a generic compactification scenario involves a calabi - yau manifold with non - isolated genus zero or higher genus cycles and five - branes wrapped on such cycles . as an example , consider a calabi - yau manifold elliptically fibered over the hirzebruch surface @xmath5 . the hirzebruch surface @xmath6 is a @xmath7 bundle over @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the class of the base of this bundle by @xmath8 and the class of the fiber by @xmath9 .",
    "these calabi - yau threefolds are simply connected and admit a ( generically unique ) global holomorphic section which we denote by @xmath10 .",
    "for such a manifold , generically , we have @xmath11 and the basis of curves can be chosen to be @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the projection map from the threefold onto the base @xmath6 and @xmath14 is the class of the elliptic fiber .",
    "the curves @xmath15 and @xmath16 have genus zero .",
    "the curve @xmath14 has genus one .",
    "the curve @xmath15 has a self - intersection @xmath17 and , thus , is an isolated genus zero curve for @xmath18 .",
    "it is a non - isolated genus zero curve for @xmath19 .",
    "the curve @xmath15 has a self - intersection zero for any @xmath20 and , thus , is non - isolated genus zero curve .",
    "therefore , it is important to stabilize the @xmath2 moduli corresponding to non - isolated genus zero or higher genus curves .",
    "it is also important to understand whether or not it is possible to stabilize five - branes wrapped on such cycles . in this paper , for simplicity , we consider the case @xmath21 .",
    "we will assume that there is one isolated genus zero curve and one curve of a different type .",
    "the generalization to the case involving many curves isolated curves of various types is conceptually straightforward but technically more difficult .    at this point",
    ", we would like to make a remark .",
    "it may happen that the pullback of more than one harmonic form @xmath22 onto a given isolated curve is non - zero . as a result , the non - perturbative superpotential associated with this isolated curve may depend on the linear combination of more than one @xmath2 modulus .",
    "in particular , it may depend on all @xmath2 moduli . in this case",
    ", all @xmath2 moduli can be stabilized by methods presented in  @xcite .",
    "however , one might expect that , generically , there can be @xmath2 moduli of two sorts , those that appear in the non - perturbative superpotential and those which do not . in this paper",
    ", we simply assume that our compactification has one modulus of each sort . in this section",
    ", we will not consider five - branes wrapped on non - isolated genus zero or higher genus curves .",
    "we will add such a five - brane in the next section .",
    "the system of moduli that we would like to consider in this section includes the following complex moduli @xmath23 the modulus @xmath24 is related to the volume of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath25 where @xmath10 is the axion .",
    "the moduli @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath2 moduli .",
    "they are defined as follows  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the size of the eleventh dimension , @xmath30 are the kahler moduli of the calabi - yau threefold and @xmath31 s come from the components of the m - theory three - form @xmath32 along the interval and the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the moduli @xmath30 are not all independent .",
    "they satisfy the constraint @xmath33 where coefficients @xmath34 are the calabi - yau intersection numbers @xmath35 the constraint   reduces the number of independent @xmath36-moduli by one",
    ". we will take @xmath26 to correspond to the area of the isolated genus zero curve and @xmath27 to the area of the remaining curve .",
    "@xmath37 is the modulus of the five - brane wrapped on the isolated genus zero curve . in this case , there is only one five - brane modulus  @xcite , whose real is the position of the five - brane in the bulk @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the axion arising from dualizing the three - form field strength propagating on the five - brane world - volume . at last , by @xmath40",
    "we denote the complex structure moduli .",
    "the actual number of them is not relevant for us .",
    "a generic heterotic compactification contains also instanton moduli  @xcite .",
    "their stabilization was considered in  @xcite . in this section , for simplicity",
    ", we will ignore them .",
    "they can be added and treated as in  @xcite .",
    "however , we will come back to them in the last section .",
    "the moduli @xmath41 and @xmath42 are assumed to be dimensionless normalized with respect to the following reference scales @xmath43 in order to obtain the four - dimensional coupling constants in the correct phenomenological range @xcite , the corresponding moduli should be stabilized at ( or be slowly rolling near ) the values @xmath44 the kahler potential for this system is as follows @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the four - dimensional planck scale and @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the area of the cycle on which the five - brane is wrapped and @xmath52 is @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the eleven - dimensional gravitational coupling constant .",
    "it is related to the four - dimensional planck mass as @xmath55 evaluating @xmath49 by using and gives @xmath56 generically this coefficient is of order one .",
    "the superpotential for this system consists of three different contributions @xmath57 @xmath58 is the flux - induced superpotential @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the m - theory four - form flux .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath58 was estimated in @xcite and was found to be , generically , of order @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , this is flexible .",
    "the superpotential @xmath58 may receive certain higher order corrections from chern - simons invariants . in  @xcite it was argued that these chern - simons invariants can reduce the order of magnitude of @xmath58 . by @xmath62",
    "we denote the superpotential induced by a gaugino condensate in the hidden sector @xcite .",
    "a non - vanishing gaugino condensate has important phenomenological consequences . among other things ,",
    "it is responsible for supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector .",
    "when that symmetry breaking is transported to the observable brane , it leads to soft supersymmetry breaking terms for the gravitino , gaugino and matter fields @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite for a good review on gaugino condensation in string theory .",
    "this superpotential has the following structure @xmath63 the order of magnitude of @xmath64 is approximately @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath66 is related to the coefficient @xmath67 of the one - loop beta - function and is given by @xmath68 for example , for the @xmath69 gauge group @xmath70 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath71 represents the tension ( up to the minus sign ) of the hidden brane measured with respect to the kahler form @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the curvature of the gauge bundle on the hidden brane .",
    "similarly , the coefficient @xmath75 is the tension of the five - brane .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the four - form poincare dual to the holomorphic curve on which the five - brane is wrapped .",
    "generically both @xmath71 and @xmath75 are of order one .",
    "in fact , from eqs .  , and and",
    "it follows that @xmath78 let us note the following fact which will be crucial for stabilization of @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath79 , apparently , it is important to have @xmath80 positive ( and , correspondingly , the tension negative ) in the hidden sector .",
    "this , in particular , happens when the bundle on the hidden brane is trivial .",
    "the reason is that the quantity @xmath81 represents the inverse square of the gauge coupling constant in the hidden sector @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , the quantity @xmath83 represents the inverse square of the gauge coupling constant in the visible sector @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 is the tension ( up to the minus sign ) of the visible brane @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the curvature of the gauge bundle on the visible brane .",
    "if , for example , @xmath79 and there are no five - branes , we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 the anomaly cancellation condition in the absence of five - branes , @xmath90 sets @xmath91 now it is clear that if @xmath92 , the gauge coupling constant in the hidden sector is weaker that the gauge coupling constant in the visible sector and the whole assumption about the gaugino condensation in the hidden sector breaks down .",
    "it is unlikely that this statement changes when five - branes are included .",
    "however , when @xmath93 is greater than zero , there is nothing wrong with having some @xmath94 s negative .",
    "it is still possible to keep the gauge coupling constant stronger in the hidden sector .",
    "we will assume that @xmath95 and @xmath96 it is important to note that the quantity given by eq",
    ".   must be positive .",
    "this means that the superpotential   can not be trusted for large values of the interval size @xmath29 .",
    "one should expect that higher order corrections to the combination   will make the gauge coupling constant @xmath82 well defined for large values of @xmath29",
    ". partial support for this comes from  @xcite .",
    "the last contribution to the superpotential that we have to discuss is the non - perturbative superpotential @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "such a superpotential is induced by open membranes wrapped on an isolated genus zero curve .",
    "therefore , it depends on the @xmath2 modulus @xmath26 and on the five - brane modulus @xmath37 . however , it does not depend on the @xmath2 modulus @xmath27 .",
    "the non - perturbative superpotential has three parts @xmath98 @xmath99 is induced by a membrane stretched between the visible and the hidden branes .",
    "it behaves as @xmath100 @xmath101 is induced by a membrane stretched between the visible brane and the five - brane .",
    "it behaves as @xmath102 at last , @xmath103 is induced by a membrane stretched between the five - brane and the hidden brane .",
    "it behaves as @xmath104 the coefficient @xmath105 is given by  @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the reference area of the isolated curve .",
    "generically , @xmath105 is much bigger than one . as in  @xcite",
    ", we will assume that the five - brane is close to the hidden sector .",
    "it was argued in  @xcite that only in this case it is possible to stabilize the size of the interval in a phenomenologically acceptable range .",
    "therefore , the contributions @xmath99 and @xmath101 decay very fast and we have @xmath108 for concreteness we assume that the coefficient @xmath109 .      in this subsection , we will argue that this system of moduli has an ads minimum .",
    "the consideration is , somewhat , similar to  @xcite and we will be relatively brief .",
    "let us first discuss the imaginary parts of the moduli .",
    "a consideration analogous to  @xcite shows that the imaginary parts of @xmath26 and @xmath37 are stabilized at values @xmath110 the imaginary part of the linear combination @xmath111 is stabilized in such a way that the superpotentials @xmath58 and @xmath62 are out of phase .",
    "similarly , @xmath58 and @xmath97 are also out phase .",
    "we already took this into account in eq .   by putting the minus sign in appropriate places",
    "unfortunately , the superpotential of the form  , , and   does not allow us to stabilize the remaining linear combination of @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "it can be shown to be a flat direction .",
    "this problem can not be resolved even by considering a multiple gaugino condensation in the hidden sector . nevertheless , it is easy to realize that this problematic linear combination can be stabilized by taking into account the higher order @xmath112-corrections to the gauge coupling in the hidden sector .",
    "we will make a more detailed comment on it later in this subsection .",
    "therefore , stabilization of the remaining imaginary part does not represent a conceptual problem .",
    "in the rest of the paper , we will concentrate only on the real parts of the moduli ignoring their imaginary parts .",
    "now let us consider the real parts of the moduli and show that the system under study indeed has an ads minimum satisfying @xmath113 where @xmath0 is the kahler covariant derivative .",
    "we will not distinguish between the superpotentials and their absolute values .",
    "first , we consider equations @xmath114 assuming that @xmath115 in the interesting regime , eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath116 in @xcite , it was shown that ineq .",

    ", all quantities depend on the complex structure moduli only .",
    "we will assume that this equation fixes all the complex structure moduli .",
    "partial evidence that equations of the type fix all the complex structure moduli comes , for example , from  @xcite .",
    "the next equation to consider is @xmath117 by using eqs .  , and  , it can be written as @xmath118 where @xmath119 by using eqs .  , , , and  , eq . @xmath120 can be rewritten as @xmath121 where @xmath122 now let us consider eq . @xmath123 note that the non - perturbative superpotential   does not depend on @xmath27 , thus , @xmath27 can not be stabilized by the same mechanism as @xmath26 . by using eqs .",
    ", , , we obtain @xmath124 where @xmath125 eqs .   and",
    "are consistent only if @xmath126 and @xmath127 are equal to each other .",
    "in particular , they must have the same sign .",
    "this is possible only if @xmath128 is negative . as we argued before ,",
    "this does not lead to any contradictions .",
    "note , that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are both real .",
    "this is the reason why only one linear combination of the imaginary parts of @xmath24 and @xmath27 moduli can be stabilized . on the other hand ,",
    "if higher order @xmath112-corrections to the quantity   are present , @xmath127 is really complex and , hence , the imaginary parts of both @xmath24 and @xmath27 moduli can be stabilized .",
    "the last equation to consider is @xmath129 by using eqs .",
    ", , , and  , we obtain @xmath130 eqs .  , , and are the four equations with four independent variables @xmath131 and one of two @xmath30 s .",

    "the five - brane is close to the hidden brane ( @xmath133 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will not perform a detailed analysis .",
    "let us just point out that in eqs .   and",
    ", the run - away moduli are stabilized by fluxes .",
    "eqs .   and   lead to eq .",
    "@xmath134 which is well defined if @xmath128 is negative .",
    ".   is a purely algebraic equation .",
    "it is possible to show that it admits a numeric solution with the right properties as in  @xcite",
    ". we will not give a numeric result in this paper .",
    "see  @xcite for a detailed analysis of similar equations .    in this subsection , we have provided stabilization of moduli listed in  .",
    "this list includes the modulus @xmath27 , corresponding to the area of a non - isolated genus zero curve or a curve of a higher genus .",
    "stabilization of such a modulus differs from stabilization of the modulus @xmath26 , corresponding to the area of an isolated genus zero curve .",
    "the crucial point in stabilization of @xmath27 is that , in the case when @xmath4 , it possible to choose the coefficient @xmath128 to be negative .",
    "it is not possible to do in the case when @xmath79 , because it would follow that the gauge coupling coupling in the hidden sector became weaker than in the visible sector .",
    "this would not be consistent with the assumption about gaugino condensation in the hidden sector .",
    "the ads vacuum constructed in this section can be raised to a metastable ds vacuum along the lines of  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by either adding fayet - iliopoulos terms to the supergravity potential energy or by working within the context of @xmath135 theory .",
    "now we would like to see what happens if we add a five - brane wrapped on a non - isolated genus zero curve or on a higher genus curve to the system of moduli considered above .",
    "we will denote the complex five - brane modulus by @xmath136 and its real part by @xmath137 .",
    "the kahler potential   receives the contribution @xmath138 the gaugino condensate superpotential gets modified and becomes @xmath139 the coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath141 are given by expressions similar to eqs .   and  .",

    "note that as @xmath137 goes to zero , @xmath217 goes to zero and @xmath255 goes to infinity .",

    "the second branch , the instanton branch , is characterized by the vanishing expectation value of @xmath137 and coincides with the moduli space of transition moduli  @xcite of an instanton on our calabi - yau threefold .",
    "this five - brane - instanton transition is called small instanton transition  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the transition is the following .",
    "as the five - brane hits the visible brane , it changes the vector bundle on the calabi - yau manifold . the second chern class of the new vector bundle changes by the amount of the curve on which the five - brane was wrapped .",
    "this new bundle has more moduli .",
    "the new moduli are",
    "precisely the transition moduli parameterizing the instanton branch of the superpotential @xmath263 . in the instanton branch ,",
    "only those components of @xmath261 , which correspond to the transition moduli , take non - zero expectation values and are massless , the remaining ones become massive and get integrated out .",
    "the five - brane is also massive and integrated out in the instanton branch .",
    "the origin represents a singularity , where all the multiplets become massless . from the bundle viewpoint",
    ", the singularity at the origin corresponds to a vector bundle becoming singular and turning into a torsion free sheaf  @xcite . from the five - brane view - point",
    ", the singularity at the origin corresponds to a five - brane coinciding with the visible brane .",
    "an analogous , but simpler , transition takes place in string theory in the @xmath264 system  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath264 system is describable by a supersymmetric field theory with eight supercharges .",
    "the moduli space of this system consists of two branches , the coulomb branch and the higgs branch .",
    "the coulomb branch describes positions of the @xmath265-brane away from the @xmath266-brane .",
    "the higgs branch describes how the @xmath265-brane can get dissolved into the @xmath266-brane .",
    "geometrically , the higgs branch is isomorphic to the one - instanton moduli space on a @xmath267-manifold which is just the adhm moduli space . in the heterotic m - theory case , the analog of the coulomb branch is the moduli space of five - branes .",
    "the analog of the higgs branch is the space of transition moduli .",
    "thus , transition moduli can be understood as a calabi - yau threefold generalization of the adhm one - instanton moduli space .",
    "now let us see how this picture changes in the presence of fluxes and non - perturbative effects .",
    "for @xmath137 very small , we have to include @xmath261 into the lagrangian .",
    "the kahler potential receives an extra contribution @xmath268 then it is not hard to show that the potential energy will contain , among others , a term @xmath269 this is a consequence of the following very simple statement .",
    "if we take the theory with the constant superpotential and quadratic kahler potential , the potential energy has a maximum at zero and for small fields is dominated by a negative quadratic term .",
    "therefore , the mass of the fields @xmath261 schematically behaves as @xmath270 this means that as the five - brane gets very close to the visible sector , the fields @xmath261 become tachyonic and begin to roll downhill .",
    "since no slow roll conditions on @xmath261 are satisfied , this terminates inflation .",
    "eventually , the five - brane hits the wall and disappears ( gets massive and integrated out from the low - energy field theory ) through a small instanton transition .",
    "in addition , those components of @xmath261 , which do not correspond to the transition instanton moduli , get a mass , according to the superpotential  , and get integrated out .",
    "now their mass is set by the vacuum expectation values of the transition moduli .",
    "the new system of moduli after the small instanton transition involves the moduli discussed in section 2 plus the new transition moduli .",
    "the physics of them will be considered in the next section .",
    "this escape from inflation is , somewhat , analogous to one in @xmath271-@xmath272 inflation studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the negative mass for the charged hypermultiplets ( analogs of our fields @xmath261 ) was created by fayet - iliopoulos terms .",
    "the same fayet - iliopoulos terms were responsible for stabilization at a non - zero value .",
    "after inflation , the five - brane disappears through a small instanton transition and turns into new vector bundle moduli , which we denote by @xmath273 .",
    "the new system of moduli contains now the following fields @xmath274 this system of moduli can be stabilized .",
    "the moduli @xmath275 and @xmath276 can be stabilized by the same mechanism as in section 2 . in this section",
    ", we will concentrate on the moduli @xmath273 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that there is only one such modulus @xmath277 .",
    "vector bundle moduli have a non - perturbative superpotential .",
    "it appears as a factor in eqs .  , and  .",
    "since after the small instanton transition only the bundle on the visible brane has changed , only @xmath101 and @xmath99 will depend on @xmath277 after the transition .",
    "in fact , @xmath278 since the coefficient @xmath105 in eqs .   and   is much greater than one .",
    "therefore , the potential for @xmath277 is @xmath279 where we have denoted the factor depending on @xmath277 by @xmath280 .",
    "let us make a remark .",
    "one can worry that , after the transition , the superpotential   will not depend on @xmath277 . indeed , the superpotential is induced by a string wrapping isolated genus zero curves . on the other hand ,",
    "the five - brane that turned into the modulus @xmath277 was wrapped on a non - isolated genus zero curve or a higher genus curve .",
    "it seems possible that the bundle over the isolated curves did not really change and the bundle moduli contribution to the superpotential will remain unchanged .",
    "however , this logic is not quite correct because the curves might intersect .",
    "if the curve on which the five - brane was wrapped intersects at least one isolated genus zero curve , the non - perturbative superpotential will change and it will depend on @xmath277 .    even though the five - brane modulus @xmath137 could not be stabilized , the new vector bundle modulus @xmath277 can .",
    "the equation @xmath281 has a solution .",
    "the analysis of this equation will be analogous to the one in  @xcite .",
    "let us recall that the superpotential @xmath282 is a sum of various contributions @xmath283 where @xmath97 is now the sum of @xmath103 and @xmath284 . then eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath285 where we have assumed that @xmath286 in  @xcite , it was shown that ineq .",
    "is indeed satisfied .",
    "vector bundle moduli superpotentials were studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "they were found to be high degree polynomials .",
    "therefore , we will take @xmath287 the kahler potential @xmath288 represents a more complicated problem .",
    "it was evaluated explicitly only for bundles which can be written as the pullback of a bundle on a four - manifold  @xcite . a generic bundle on a threefold",
    "is , obviously , not of this form . in this paper",
    ", we will not need the actual form of the kahler potential .",
    "using eq .   and ignoring the imaginary part of @xmath37 , eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath289 clearly , such an equation has a solution for a generic function @xmath288 . to present a numeric solution",
    ", we need to know the order of magnitude of @xmath290 .",
    "it was estimated in  @xcite and found to be @xmath291 in planck units .",
    "then , if @xmath292 is sufficiently large , we can approximately write eq .   as follows @xmath293 taking , as an example , @xmath294 we obtain @xmath295 the relatively large value of @xmath277 means that the gauge connection is spread out over the calabi - yau manifold , rather than sharply peaked over some curve . as long as we stay away from singularities in the moduli space of vector bundles , any value of @xmath277 is acceptable . to be slightly more precise , eq .",
    "is a solution for the absolute value of @xmath277 .",

    "that is , it is possible to fix all moduli after inflation .",

    "they second and the third terms are positive . in the previous section , we argued that the existence of fayet - iliopoulos terms in the visible sector is not relevant for inflation .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume that they are present .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath298 has to be positive and large .",
    "after the small instanton transition , some of the contributions to the cosmological constant might change , because they depend on the properties of the vector bundle . the contribution @xmath299 might change because , as was argued in  @xcite , the flux - induced superpotential may receive higher order corrections from chern - simons invariants which depend on the choice of the bundle . the contribution @xmath300 will change because it depends on the gauge connection . moreover , since after a small instanton transition there is a possibility of changing the number of families of quarks and leptons  @xcite , the corresponding @xmath3 gauge group might not be anomalous anymore . in this case",
    "@xmath300 will be zero .",
    "however , @xmath301 will not change because the bundle on the hidden brane remains unchanged .",
    "all these arguments show that , in principle , the cosmological constant changes after inflation . since it receives both negative and positive contributions , it is possible , by fine tuning , to make it consistent with observations .",
    "in this paper , we considered dynamics of the five - brane wrapped on a non - isolated genus zero or higher genus curve .",
    "non - perturbative superpotentials do not depend on moduli of such five - branes .",
    "we showed that fluxes and non - perturbative effects can stabilize such a five - brane in a non - supersymmetric ads vacuum .",
    "we also showed that addition of fayet - iliopoulos terms not only can raise this vacuum to a ds vacuum but also can create one more ds vacuum .",
    "we also stabilized @xmath2 moduli which do not have non - perturbative superpotentials .",
    "the cosmological constant of the vacuum can be positive and fine tuned to be consistent with observations .",
    "this provides a generalization of results of  @xcite and shows that the most complete system of heterotic string moduli can be stabilized in a vacuum with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "in addition , we showed that , by modifying the supergravity potential energy with fayet - iliopoulos terms , one can create an inflationary potential and treat the five - brane translational modulus as an inflaton .",
    "however , the potential can not be trusted at very small distances because one should expect extra light states to appear .",
    "we give a qualitative argument how such new states can terminate inflation .",
    "the idea is that , in the presence of fluxes and non - perturbative effects , these extra states can become tachyonic when the five - brane comes very close to the visible brane .",
    "eventually , the five - brane hits the visible brane .",
    "the system undergoes a small instanton transition which changes the vector bundle on the visible brane .",
    "the five - brane disappears from the low - energy spectrum while the vector bundle moduli are created .",
    "they have simpler stability properties and , as a result , the new system of moduli can be stabilized .",
    "we also argue that the cosmological constant changes after the transition . the cosmological constant after the transition can be fine tuned to be consistent with observations .",
    "the author is indebted to juan maldacena for lots of interesting and helpful discussions .",
