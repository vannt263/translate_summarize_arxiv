    "it has long been known that galaxies in the nearby universe display a range of morphological characteristics that distinguish between disk - dominated ( e.g. spiral ) and spheroid - dominated ( e.g. elliptical ) galaxies , with many fine subdivisions within each class ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origins of these different types of galaxy and the evolutionary connections , if any , between them are still unclear , although there is a wealth of observational data and several proposed theories .    traditionally , morphology has been assigned by human classifiers directly from galaxy images , a process that is accurate only to within about two t - types @xcite .",
    "more recently , computer - based algorithms have been developed which show a reasonable correlation with `` eyeball '' estimates , at least for bright galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , all these classifications tend to give considerable weight to detailed morphological features , such as spiral arms or asymmetries in the image , and are difficult to compare with current theoretical predictions which focus on simpler quantities such as the total stellar mass or luminosity in the disk and spheroidal components . here",
    ", we consider a morphological quantifier that is more easily related to theoretical models .",
    "it is widely believed that disks form by slow accretion of gas which acquired angular momentum through tidal torques @xcite , although whether this picture works in detail remains an open question @xcite .",
    "spheroids , on the other hand , are thought to form either by a `` monolithic collapse '' @xcite , or as a result of mergers of pre - existing galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "detailed theoretical predictions for the statistical morphological properties of galaxies and their evolution have been calculated for the hierarchical merging formation mechanism appropriate to cold dark matter cosmologies @xcite . among other things ,",
    "these models give the relative luminosities and stellar masses of the spheroids and disks of galaxies .    in this work ,",
    "we measure the i - band bulge - to - total light ratio , b / t , for a large sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts by fitting two - dimensional models to the observed galaxy images .",
    "we use this information to estimate the spheroid and disk luminosity functions , as well as the total stellar mass that resides in disks and spheroids . an earlier attempt to estimate the relative contributions to the luminosity from spheroids and disks",
    "was carried out by @xcite , based on `` eyeball '' estimates of the bulge - to - total ratio .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in  [ sec : data ] we describe our basic dataset . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] we introduce the method used to fit model images to the data and thereby extract b / t ( along with other interesting parameters ) and describe how we estimate errors . in  [ sec : results ] we examine the accuracy of our technique and determine how well the b / t ratio can be measured as a function of the apparent magnitude of a galaxy .",
    "we then compute luminosity functions and total stellar masses for spheroids and disks .",

    "exposures of 300s reached @xmath6 detection depths of b=21.1 , v=20.9 and i=19.6 in 10-arcsecond circular apertures .",
    "imaging was also carried out in the k - band using the irim camera on the kpno 1.3-m telescope resulting in 1.96-arcsecond per pixel images , and a @xmath6 detection depth of k=15.6 in a 10-arcsecond circular aperture .",

    "@xmath9 and ra 18@xmath70@xmath8 , dec .",
    "@xmath10 ) .",
    "the i - band images , which we will use in this work , were bias - subtracted , flattened using twilight flats and with median sky flats .",
    "objects were identified with the sextractor program ( @xcite ) , using a @xmath11 threshold .",
    "the seeing in the optical images varied in the range @xmath12 arcsec .",
    "one field contained a nearby rich galaxy cluster .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up was obtained for a k - selected sample in sub - regions of total area @xmath13 deg@xmath4 , using the autofib-2 fiber positioner and wyffos spectrograph on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope on la palma .",
    "spectra were obtained for 567 galaxies with k@xmath14 , which allowed redshifts to be measured for 510 galaxies ( a redshift completeness of 90% ) .",
    "although the spectroscopic sample is k - selected , this does not introduce any incompleteness in the i@xmath15 sample used extensively in this work ( i.e. there are no galaxies with i@xmath16k@xmath17 in the sample ) .",
    "we also briefly consider an i@xmath18 sample , for which the spectroscopic completeness falls to around 50% because of the k - band selection ( which also introduces a bias in this fainter sample against objects that are blue in i@xmath16k ) .",

    "our approach is similar to theirs , but we apply the technique to a large photometric sample of real galaxies .",
    "we consider the `` real - world '' problems of automated masking of nearby galaxies and stars and make a thorough assessment of the errors in the measured parameters .",

    "the spheroid is allowed an ellipticity ( defined as the ratio of semi - major to semi - minor axes ) in the range 1 to 6 , and can also have an arbitrary position angle . to mimic seeing ,",
    "we construct mock images using these profiles which we then smooth with a gaussian filter ( integrated over each pixel to account for the variation of the psf across the pixel ) , @xmath29/2\\pi\\sigma^2 .",

    "( we will examine in  [ sec : acc ] the effect of using a more realistic psf . )",
    "the postage stamp images were centered on the galaxy of interest , but we allow the position of the image center to vary since in many cases the resulting sub - pixel variations lead to lower values of @xmath30 .",
    "we also allow a small contribution from a faint , constant surface brightness background in order to take into account small inaccuracies in sky subtraction .",
    "the best fitting parameters for each galaxy were then obtained by minimizing @xmath31 using powell s algorithm @xcite .",
    "there are a total of 12 fit parameters ( 13 if we include @xmath32 when fitting @xmath28 spheroid profiles ) summarized in table  [ tb : fitpars ] . in ",
    "[ sec : acc ] we will consider how accurately this procedure recovers the b / t ratio of the galaxies .",

    "each parameter is described in the text .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     a significant fraction of the postage stamp images was contaminated by a secondary galaxy ( and occasionally by more than one ) .",
    "we use a simple algorithm to identify such contaminants and mask them from the image .",
    "the aim is to remove objects which are physically distinct from the galaxy of interest without masking any pixels of the galaxy itself .",
    "we first rank the pixels in the image by surface brightness and then proceed to find groups of bright pixels .",
    "the brightest pixel is assigned to the first group .",
    "successive pixels are assigned to a pre - existing group if they touch it ( i.e. if they are adjacent either horizontally , vertically or diagonally ) , or else are assigned to a new group . in the case where a pixel touches more than one group ,",
    "the two groups are merged .",
    "this process is continued until pixels of a fixed signal - to - noise are reached ( specifically , we consider only pixels more than @xmath11 above the sky background ) . if more than one group exists at this point , the group at the center is deemed to be the galaxy of interest and the pixels of all secondary groups are marked as being contaminated and are not included in the @xmath31 sum .",
    "this simple algorithm works well in the majority of cases , but it fails in a few ( 28 out of 636 galaxies ) , either by not removing a contaminating galaxy , or by removing a significant fraction of the primary galaxy . rather than attempting to use a more complex algorithm in these cases , we resorted to cleaning the image by hand ( i.e. we view the image and manually mark the contaminated pixels ) .",
    "+   +    the majority of galaxies ( 363 out of 626 ) are fit reasonably well by this procedure .",
    "we regard a galaxy as being reasonably well fit when @xmath33 , the probability that the measured value of @xmath30 is exceeded by random fluctuations , is greater than 5% . not surprisingly though",
    ", many galaxies are not well fit .",
    "these typically show signs of strong morphological disturbance ( perhaps due to a recent or imminent merger ) or other inhomogeneities .",
    "examples of well - fit and poorly - fit galaxies are given in figure  [ fig : resids ] .",
    "poorly - fit galaxies are easily identified by their large @xmath30 values and so may be excluded from further analysis if desired . it should be noted that a poor - fit does not indicate a failure of our fitting procedure _ per se _",
    ", rather it signals that the galaxy is not well described by a combination of a spheroid and a disk .",
    "we choose to show results computed using the entire sample , regardless of how well a galaxy was fit , but we will comment on how our results change if badly fit galaxies are excluded from the analysis .",
    "errors on the fitted parameters could , in principle , be determined using a @xmath34 approach , but this would require mapping @xmath35 in the 12 dimensional parameter space of the fit  an exceedingly time consuming exercise  and , in any case , the errors are unlikely to be normally distributed given that the model is highly nonlinear in the parameters .",
    "we therefore adopt a monte carlo approach to error estimation . using the best fitting model for each galaxy",
    ", we generate 30 realizations of that model , add random noise at the same level as in the real image , and mask out any pixels which were masked out in the original .",
    "we then find the best fitting parameters for each realization and take their distribution as indicative of the uncertainties in the actual fit .",
    "it should be noted that this is only a valid procedure if the original image is well fit by the model . in cases where this is not the case ,",
    "there is no reason to expect the monte carlo distributions to give an estimate of the true errors .",
    "the b / t distributions for the three galaxies illustrated in figure  [ fig : resids ] are shown in that figure .",
    "we begin by assessing the reliability of our procedure for recovering the true b / t ratio of a galaxy ( assuming , of course , that real galaxies are well described by our model ) .",
    "our monte carlo procedure for error estimation allows a determination of the accuracy of our technique . for each galaxy , the value of b / t input into the monte carlo simulations",
    "may be compared to the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of 30 recovered b / t values .",
    "figure  [ fig : accuracy ] gives the results of these accuracy tests .",
    "the left - hand panel shows the standard deviation of the recovered b / t ratio , as a function of the i - band apparent magnitude of the mock image . for bright galaxies ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is fairly small , typically less than about 0.1 .",
    "however , for fainter galaxies , @xmath37 increases very rapidly , resulting in rather poorly constrained b / t values .",
    "( in reality , @xmath37 depends also upon the other parameters that describe the mock image , but the correlation with apparent magnitude is the most important . )    in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : accuracy ] , we plot the mean value of b / t recovered from the monte carlo simulations against the true value for the mock image .",
    "the large solid circles indicate those images for which @xmath38 . evidently , for these galaxies the value of b / t is recovered accurately and without any strong systematic bias .",
    "the small dots show the results for all other galaxies . now",
    "the scatter is much larger and , more importantly , there are systematic biases in the mean recovered b / t , such that very low and very high values are avoided .",
    "this effect is not surprising : the values of b / t for these faint galaxies are almost entirely unconstrained .",
    "( note that the standard deviation for a completely uniform distribution of b / t is approximately 0.3 . ) as a result , the distribution of b / t from the monte carlo simulations becomes close to uniform , with the mean tending towards 0.5 as @xmath37 increases .",
    "for the 90 galaxies in our sample with @xmath39 , there is a tight correlation between @xmath40 and the mean value recovered from the monte carlo simulations and it is this subsample that we will use below to compute luminosity functions .",
    "unfortunately , its relatively small size limits the statistical accuracy of our estimates quite considerably .    to find the best fit solution we must choose initial values for the parameters to be fit and then use powell s algorithm to search for values producing a better fit . for parameters such as the position angles ,",
    "disk inclination and spheroid / disk sizes we make initial guesses based on the image being fitted .",
    "other parameters are initially assigned `` typical '' values .",
    "we have checked the effect of altering these initial values . for galaxies with @xmath41 ,",
    "the choice of initial value makes almost no difference to the recovered values of the parameters , indicating that our technique is finding the true minimum @xmath30 . as @xmath37 becomes larger , however , the recovered parameters begin to depend strongly upon the initial values chosen . for these images , the @xmath30 surface in the 12 dimensional parameter space does not possess an obvious minimum",
    "( i.e. it is very noisy ) .",
    "this is just another way of saying that the values of the fitted parameters for these faint images are highly uncertain .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the bulges of spiral galaxies are more accurately fit by an @xmath28 , rather than by the more usual @xmath25 , surface brightness profile , with values of @xmath32 ranging from around 1 to 6 ( similar variations in @xmath32 are seen for elliptical galaxies ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they show that the value of @xmath32 is strongly correlated with morphological type .",
    "although our present data provide only rather poor constraints on the value of @xmath32 ( due to limited angular resolution and signal - to - noise ) , we have nevertheless repeated the fitting procedure using @xmath28 profiles for the spheroids , treating @xmath32 as a free parameter . for galaxies where",
    "the b / t ratio is well determined , we find that there is a strong correlation between the b / t values obtained with @xmath25 and @xmath28 profiles , although inevitably some scatter is present .",
    "the disk and spheroid luminosity functions computed using b / t ratios from @xmath28 fits show no statistically significant difference from those using @xmath25 fits .    finally , we remind the reader that our analysis makes use of a gaussian psf to mimic the effects of seeing in the data .",
    "a gaussian accurately describes the core of the psf measured from bright stars in the images .",
    "however , a profile consisting of a gaussian core plus power - law wings provides a better match to many of the stellar profiles .",
    "( the variation of gaussian and core components from night to night in the imaging data is not so well characterized , however , and this is why we make use of a simple gaussian for our main analysis . ) fitting the images using such a profile ( keeping the relative proportions of gaussian and power - law wings fixed , but allowing the overall radial scale of the psf to be a free parameter ) results in small changes in the b / t ratio , typically significantly smaller than the error in the best fit value .",
    "thus , the luminosity functions presented below are unaffected by the exact choice of psf .",
    "however , it is clear that a good characterization of the psf and its variation will be crucial to obtain accurate disk and spheroid luminosity functions from larger , higher quality datasets .      using the i@xmath15 sample of approximately 90 galaxies for which we have good estimates of the b / t ratio we now proceed to estimate the disk and spheroid luminosity functions .",
    "our aim here is to develop the techniques required for this measurement and demonstrate them using a particular dataset .",
    "given the small size of the dataset we must expect that both statistical ( due to the small number of galaxies ) and systematic ( due , for example , to the lack of rich clusters in the dataset ) errors will be present .",
    "these issues are considered further in  [ sec : disc ] .    to determine the present - day luminosity functions , we need to apply k@xmath42e corrections to the galaxy luminosities .",
    "we use the type - dependent k@xmath42e corrections obtained by @xcite .",
    "briefly , a set of model galaxy colors was computed using an updated version of the @xcite stellar population models with a range of star formation histories .",
    "the observed colors of each galaxy were matched to one of the models and that particular model was then used to extrapolate the observed galaxy luminosity to @xmath43 .",
    "note that our type - dependent k@xmath42e corrections are based on the _ total _",
    "( i.e. disk plus spheroid ) color of each galaxy . in principle , k@xmath42e corrections could be applied to each component separately if spheroid / disk decompositions were carried out in several bands .",
    "given the uncertainties in our present estimates of b / t , we refrain from this degree of complexity in this analysis .",
    "we use the stepwise maximum likelihood ( swml ) estimator proposed by ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter eep ) and also the parametric maximum likelihood method proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sty ) to compute disk and spheroid luminosity functions .",
    "the detectability of a spheroid depends on both its apparent magnitude and the b / t ratio , and we must account for this in constructing the likelihood function .",
    "this leads us to define a two - dimensional function , @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 is the number of galaxies per unit volume with b / t ratio in the range @xmath46 to @xmath47 and _ spheroid _ absolute magnitude in the range @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( with an equivalent definition for disks ) .",
    "the application of the maximum likelihood estimator to this function is discussed in detail in appendix  a. the normal luminosity function of spheroids is readily derived using @xmath50 ( and similarly for disks ) . for the sty method",
    "we must assume some parametric form for the luminosity function .",
    "we have tried fitting the disk and spheroid luminosity functions with a `` schechter@xmath51exponential '' form , namely @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the normal schechter function and @xmath54 is a parameter to be fit , motivated by the shape of the swml estimate of these luminosity functions .    figure  [ fig : ilf ] shows the resulting i - band luminosity functions with distances computed assuming @xmath55 instead changes our results only slightly , shifting the luminosity function faintwards due to the smaller luminosity distance in this model . ] and @xmath56km / s / mpc .",
    "triangles show the total luminosity function ; circles and stars show the spheroid and disk luminosity functions separately .",
    "these swml luminosity functions are normalized to the i - band number counts in the sloan digital sky survey using the procedure described in the appendix . for the total luminosity function , we plot the standard swml errorbars ( obtained from the covariance matrix of the luminosity function as described by eep ) , but for the spheroid and disk luminosity functions ,",
    "the errorbars are the sum in quadrature of the standard swml errors and the variance in the luminosity function estimated from the 30 monte carlo realizations of the spheroid / disk decomposition process .",
    "the errors from each source are of comparable magnitude ( although the variance from the monte carlo realizations is the smaller of the two ) .",
    "the very heavy solid line shows the best - fitting schechter function to the total luminosity function ( determined using the sty method ) ; the inset shows the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for this fit , together with their 1 and @xmath59 error contours .",
    "( the small sample size is reflected in rather large and correlated uncertainties in @xmath58 and @xmath57 . )",
    "heavy and thin solid lines show the best fit sty `` schechter@xmath51exponential '' luminosity function fits to the spheroid and disk luminosity functions respectively ( with the corresponding confidence ellipses for @xmath57 and @xmath58 shown in the inset , and the values of @xmath54 given in the figure caption ) .",
    "a likelihood ratio test @xcite shows that the schechter@xmath51exponential luminosity function is not a particularly good fit to the data . with the present small dataset we have been unable to find a better functional form",
    "this situation will be rectified with a larger dataset ( assuming that some suitable functional form does actually exist ) .",
    "the i - band luminosity functions of disks and spheroids are remarkably similar .",
    "the only significant difference is that the spheroid luminosity function is somewhat lower at faint magnitudes .",
    "however , given the small size of the present sample , this difference may not be robust .",
    "the luminosity densities in disks and spheroids obtained by integrating the swml luminosity functions over the range of absolute magnitudes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ilf ] are @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively ( where we have taken @xmath62 in the i - band ; @xcite ) . in principle , we can use our schechter@xmath51exponential fits to estimate the total luminosity density , extrapolating to include the contribution from arbitrarily faint spheroids and disks .",
    "doing so yields results which agree with the swml estimates within the quoted errors , suggesting that our determination may have suitably converged .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the schechter@xmath51exponential form is not a particularly good fit to the current datasets .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rat ] , we show slices through the bi - variate luminosity function , @xmath44 , at constant @xmath48 for several values of @xmath48 ( as indicated in the figure , and in bins of width @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is evident that @xmath44 is _ not _ independent of @xmath46 and that , in fact , it may not be separable into a simpler form @xmath64 .",
    "this is particularly noticeable for the spheroid luminosity function .",
    "figure  [ fig : rat ] shows that spheroid - dominated systems ( i.e. b / t@xmath65 ) are found only in the brightest spheroids , while disk - dominated systems ( i.e. d / t@xmath65 ) have disks with a much broader range of luminosities .",
    "this point is made more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : evss ] where we show the spheroid luminosity function of spheroid - dominated systems and the disk luminosity function of disk - dominated systems .",
    "we find spheroid - dominated systems in abundance only brightwards of @xmath66 , but disk - dominated systems across the whole range of luminosities .      the stellar mass associated with the luminosity of each galaxy is easily obtained by a similar procedure to that employed to calculate the k - corrections ( namely fitting their bvik colors to a set of template galaxies ) .",
    "we use these estimates to construct the stellar mass functions of spheroids and disks in the local universe and thereby estimate the total mass content in each component .",
    "the method that we adopt is the same that @xcite used to measure the _ total _ stellar mass density in the universe from a combination of 2dfgrs and 2mass data .",
    "@xcite found the stellar mass density in units of the critical density to be @xmath67 or @xmath68 , depending on whether a @xcite or a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( imf ) was assumed .",
    "( both estimates include the effects of dust on galaxy luminosities as described by @xcite . )",
    "we normalize our stellar mass functions by requiring them to produce the same number density of galaxies more massive than @xmath1 as the @xcite stellar mass function . the total stellar mass density inferred from our @xmath21 sample",
    "is then @xmath69 or @xmath70 for the same two imfs respectively and the same prescription for dust - extinction .",
    "errors on the stellar mass density were found by summing in quadrature the error from each individual bin in the swml mass function , together with the error in the overall normalization .",
    "our estimates include contributions from galaxies with stellar masses greater than @xmath71 below which the swml stellar mass function is not well determined .",
    "we can check our result using the sty stellar mass function . for this , we fit a schechter function convolved with a gaussian of width @xmath72 in @xmath73 to account for the scatter in the relation between stellar mass and i - band absolute magnitude .",
    "we find that our estimates of @xmath74 using the swml and sty mass functions agree within the errors , suggesting that the result has already converged to sufficient accuracy .",
    "our estimates , however , are lower than those of @xcite , a reflection of the flatter faint end slope of our mass functions which may well be due to the small size of our sample",
    ".    for our @xmath75 sample , for which the bulge - to - total ratio is well measured , we find a slightly higher total stellar mass density of @xmath76 for the @xcite imf .",
    "splitting into spheroidal and disk components , we find @xmath77 and @xmath78 for this same imf .",
    "( note that with the swml method the stellar mass densities of disks and spheroids are not guaranteed to sum to give the total stellar mass density . )",
    "if , instead , we assume a salpeter imf , the ratio of disk to spheroid stellar mass densities increases slightly from 1.31 to 1.37 , but this change is negligible given the current errors in these quantities .",
    "although the small size of our sample is clearly a significant limitation , this initial result suggests that spheroids and disks contribute about equally to the stellar mass density of the universe .",
    "the techniques developed in this paper , when applied to a much larger dataset , should allow their contributions to be more accurately determined .",
    "we have presented a detailed method to determine the bulge - to - total ratios of galaxies by fitting to two - dimensional photometry , and have applied this technique to determine the i - band bulge - to - total luminosity ratios of a sample of approximately 600 galaxies brighter than i@xmath79 with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "our approach is designed to work with realistic galaxy images , dealing automatically with contamination by nearby objects , a varying psf and small changes in the background from image to image .",
    "a crucial part of the fitting procedure is a monte carlo determination of the errors on the fitted parameters , an approach which is favored since it is fast and automatically accounts for the highly non - linear nature of the model parameters . for the current sample of galaxies , around 60%",
    "are well fit by a combination of an exponential disk and an @xmath25-law spheroid .",
    "those that are not well fit frequently show signs of morphological disturbance .",
    "we find that bulge - to - total ratios are determined accurately ( i.e. with errors of around @xmath80 ) only for galaxies brighter than i@xmath81 .",
    "for the 90 galaxies brighter than i@xmath82 in this sample we measure the b / t ratio with reasonable accuracy .",
    "we have used the resulting disk / spheroid decomposition of these bright galaxies to construct separate luminosity functions for disks and spheroids .",
    "we find no significant differences between them when considered purely in terms of luminosity , although the statistical uncertainties associated with the small sample size make the detection of any differences difficult .",
    "however , when we consider the bi - variate distributions of luminosity and bulge - to - total or disk - to - total light , we find that spheroid dominated systems ( b / t@xmath65 ) only occur for the brightest spheroids , while disk - dominated systems ( d / t@xmath65 ) occur for a much broader range of disk luminosities .    the relative contributions of disks and spheroids to the total stellar mass density in the universe is a very important constraint on theories of galaxy formation which attempt to describe the assembly of galaxies as a function of time .",
    "we find , perhaps surprisingly , that the disks and spheroids in our sample contribute almost equally to the stellar mass density today ( in a ratio of @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the stellar populations in disks are generally younger than those in spheroids , it is an interesting coincidence that the total stellar mass in the two kinds of structural components should be so similar at the present time .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion to ours using a photometric comparison technique to estimate the b - band bulge - to - disk ratios of galaxies .",
    "while this technique may not be as accurate as our own on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis , it should provide a good estimate of the total contribution of each component to the stellar mass density .",
    "it is therefore reassuring that our results agree well with those of @xcite .",
    "a different result was obtained by @xcite , who derived a ratio of disk to spheroid stellar mass density of @xmath83 .",
    "although they found comparable b - band luminosity density in spheroids and disks , they adopted a spheroid mass - to - light ratio around four times greater than that for disks , resulting in spheroids making a significantly greater contribution to the stellar mass density . while we use a more accurate technique for converting from luminosity to stellar mass ( a technique which could be improved further if b / t ratios were measured for each galaxy in several bands ) , the small size of our sample limits the accuracy of our results .",
    "in particular , our sample may not contain enough rich clusters which are known to contain higher fractions of spheroid dominated galaxies than the field ( e.g. @xcite ) and this could introduce a small bias in our results .    clearly the greatest limitation of this work is the small size of the sample of galaxies for which accurate disk / spheroid decompositions can be performed .",
    "fortunately , this problem should be remedied in the near future with the advent of high quality , large area photometric surveys such as that being carried out by the sdss project .",

    "the traditional @xmath85 estimator is trivially adapted to the case of disk and spheroid luminosity functions .",
    "the estimator is applied just as in the case of the standard luminosity function , except that the _ total _ luminosity of the galaxy ( i.e. disk plus spheroid luminosity ) is used to compute @xmath86 , since it is this total luminosity that determines the volume within which the galaxy could have been detected .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter eep ) is also easily generalized to the case of spheroid and disk luminosity functions .",
    "consider the case of the spheroid luminosity function ( the same arguments apply to disks ) .",
    "as noted earlier , the detectability of a spheroid depends upon both its absolute magnitude , @xmath48 , and on the bulge - to - total ratio which we denote by @xmath46 in this appendix .",
    "we begin therefore by defining a two - dimensional function , @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 is the number of galaxies with bulge - to - total ratio in the range @xmath46 to @xmath47 and _ spheroid _ absolute magnitude @xmath48 to @xmath49 per unit volume",
    ". the normal luminosity function of spheroids is easily recovered using @xmath50 .",
    "the probability that galaxy @xmath87 with spheroid magnitude @xmath88 and bulge - to - total ratio @xmath89 is seen in a magnitude limited survey is @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the limiting absolute magnitude of the survey at redshift @xmath93 .",
    "the use of @xmath94 is necessary since arbitrarily faint spheroids will make it into the survey provided that they have a sufficiently low bulge - to - total ratio ( corresponding to sufficiently bright disks ) .",
    "from this definition we can construct the usual likelihood function @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the total number of galaxies .",
    "there are now two ways to proceed . in the first we assume a simple parametric form for @xmath44 and",
    "maximize the likelihood with respect to the parameters .",
    "this is analogous to fitting a schechter function @xcite to the normal luminosity function ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a simple parametric form which we have tried to fit our data is @xmath97 where @xmath53 is the usual schechter function and @xmath54 is a parameter to be estimated from the fit . with this method , the likelihood function of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : lnl ] ) can be evaluated for each value of the three parameters @xmath57 , @xmath54 and @xmath58 , and hence the parameter values which maximize the likelihood are readily obtained .",
    "the second approach involves splitting @xmath44 into bins in @xmath48 and @xmath46 and treating each as a parameter .",
    "this is equivalent to the swml method of eep for estimating the standard luminosity function .",
    "we represent @xmath44 as follows : @xmath98 the likelihood function may then be written as @xmath99 \\right\\ } + \\hbox{const},\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 = { 1 \\over \\delta m \\delta b } \\int_{b_h-\\delta b/2}^{b_h+\\delta b/2 } \\int_{m_k-\\delta m/2}^{m_k+\\delta m/2 } q(m , b ) { \\rm d}m { \\rm d}b,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 if @xmath103 and @xmath104 otherwise .",
    "since only the shape of the luminosity function is constrained by the above likelihood function , we introduce an additional constraint , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the total luminosity of a galaxy with spheroid magnitude @xmath107 and bulge - to - total ratio @xmath108 and @xmath109 is a fiducial luminosity ( which we will take to be that corresponding to @xmath110 ) , using a lagrangian multiplier @xmath111 as did eep . maximizing @xmath112 then yields @xmath113/\\sum_{l=1}^{n_p } \\sum_{m=1}^{n_q } \\phi_{l , m } h[m_l , b_m , m_{\\rm lim}(z_i)]}\\ ] ] which are easily solved with an iterative procedure .",
    "the covariance matrix for the parameters is obtained in a manner entirely analogous to that outlined by eep .",
    "normalization of the maximum likelihood luminosity function can be achieved using the actual redshift data as described by @xcite , but using @xmath94 in the selection function to account for the effects of the bulge - to - total ratio .",
    "a better approach is to normalize by performing a least squares fit to the number counts of galaxies from a wide area survey .",
    "the cumulative number count to apparent magnitude @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the distance modulus and k@xmath42e correction respectively at redshift @xmath118 , which we can compute from the swml estimate of @xmath119 ."
