    ". the surprising features of the rwre model alluded to above can be appreciated if one notes , already for a product measure @xmath10 , that the rwre can be transient with zero speed @xmath24 .",
    "further , if @xmath10 is a product measure and @xmath32 denotes the speed of a ( biased ) simple random walk with probability of jump to the right equal , at any site , to @xmath33 , then jensen s inequality reveals that @xmath34 , with examples of strict inequality readily available .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the rwre spends a large time in small traps .",

    "more explicitly , fix an interval @xmath41 $ ] encircling the origin and for @xmath42 in that interval , define @xmath43 then , @xmath44 from which the conclusion follows .",
    "the proof of the lln is more instructive : define the hitting times @xmath45 , and set @xmath46 .",

    "the ergodic case is obtained by iterating the relation ( [ pp1 ] ) .",
    "the hitting times @xmath64 are also the beginning of the study of limit laws for @xmath40 . to appreciate this in the case of product measures @xmath10 with @xmath65 ( i.e. , when the rwre is transient to @xmath66 ) ,",
    "one first observes that from the above recursions , @xmath67 defining @xmath68 , one then expects that @xmath69 , suitably rescaled , possesses a limit law , with @xmath70-dependent scaling .",
    "this is indeed the case : for @xmath71 , it is not hard to check that one obtains a central limit theorem with scaling @xmath72 ( this holds true in fact for ergodic environments under appropriate mixing assumptions and with a suitable definition of the parameter @xmath70 , see @xcite ) . for @xmath73 ,",
    "one obtains in the i.i.d .",
    "environment case a stable(@xmath70 ) limit law with scaling @xmath74 ( the cases @xmath75 or @xmath76 can also be handled but involve logarithmic factors in the scaling and the deterministic shift ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath77 the walk is _ sub - diffusive_. we omit the details , referring to @xcite for the proof , except to say that the extension to ergodic environments of many of these results has recently been carried out , see @xcite .",
    "* traps *    the unusual behavior of one dimensional rwre is due to the existence of traps in the environment .",
    "this is exhibited most dramatically when one tries to evaluate the probability of slowdown of the rwre .",
    "assume that @xmath10 is a product measure , @xmath40 is transient to @xmath66 with positive speed @xmath24 ( this means that @xmath78 by theorem [ theo-1 ] ) , and that @xmath79 ( which means that @xmath80 ) .",
    "one then has :    [ theo-3 ] for any @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 small enough , @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86    ( extensions of theorem [ theo-3 ] to the mixing environment setup are presented in @xcite .",
    "there are also precise asymptotics available in the case @xmath87 and @xmath88 , see @xcite ) .",
    "one immediately notes the difference in scaling between the annealed and quenched slowdown estimates in theorem [ theo-3 ] .",
    "these are due to the fact that , under the quenched measure , traps are almost surely of a maximal given size , determined by @xmath10 , whereas under the annealed measure @xmath22 one can create , at some cost in probability , larger traps .    to demonstrate the role of traps in the rwre model , let us exhibit , for @xmath89 , a lower bound that captures the correct behavior in the annealed setup , and that forms the basis for the proof of the more general statement .",
    "indeed , @xmath90 .",
    "fixing @xmath91 , it holds that @xmath92 satisfies a large deviation principle with rate function @xmath93 , and it is not hard to check that @xmath94 . fixing a @xmath95 such that @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , one checks that the probability that there exists in @xmath98 $ ] a point @xmath42 with @xmath99 is at least @xmath100 .",
    "but , the probability that the rwre does not cross such a segment by time @xmath101 is , due to ( [ 2 ] ) , bounded away from @xmath54 uniformly in @xmath101",
    ". this yields the claimed lower bound in the annealed case . in the quenched case , one has to work with traps of size almost @xmath102 for which @xmath103 , which occur with probability 1 eventually , and use ( [ 2 ] ) to compute the probability of an atypical slowdown inside such a trap .",
    "the fluctuations in the length of these typical traps is the reason why the slowdown probability is believed , for @xmath10-a.e .",
    "@xmath39 , to fluctuate with @xmath101 , in the sense that @xmath104 while it is known that @xmath105 this has been demonstrated rigorously in some particular cases , see @xcite .",
    "the role of traps , and the difference they produce between the quenched and annealed regimes , is dramatic also in the scale of large deviations . roughly , the exponential ( in @xmath101 ) rate of decay of the probability of atypical events differ between the quenched and annealed regime :    [ theo-4 ] the random variables @xmath106 satisfy , for @xmath10-a.e .",

    "they satisfy a ldp with rate function @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the specific entropy of @xmath111 with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath112 denotes the space of stationary ergodic measures on @xmath5 .",
    "theorem [ theo-4 ] means that to create an annealed large deviation , one may first `` modify '' the environment ( at a certain exponential cost ) and then apply the quenched ldp in the new environment .",
    "we refer to @xcite ( quenched ) and @xcite for proofs and generalizations to non i.i.d .",
    "we also note that theorem [ theo-4 ] stands in sharp contrast to what happens for random walks on galton - watson trees , where the growth of the tree creates enough variability in the ( quenched ) environment to make the annealed and quenched ldp s identical , see @xcite .    *",
    "sinai s recurrent walk and aging *    when @xmath113 , traps stop being local , and the whole environment becomes a diffused trap .",
    "the walk spends most of its time `` at the bottom of the trap '' , and as time evolves it is harder and harder for the rwre to move .",
    "this is the phenomenum of _ aging _ , captured in the following theorem :    [ theo-5 ] there exists a random variable @xmath114 , depending on the environment only , such that @xmath115 further , for @xmath116 , @xmath117 \\,.\\ ] ]    the first part of theorem [ theo-5 ] is due to sinai @xcite , with kesten @xcite providing the evaluation of the limiting law of @xmath114 .",
    "the second part is implicit in @xcite , we refer to @xcite and @xcite for the proof and references .",
    "-5 mm      two special features simplify the analysis of the rwre in the one - dimensional case : first , for every realization of the environment , the rwre is a reversible markov chain .",
    "this gave transience and recurrence criteria .",
    "then , the location of the walk at the hitting times @xmath64 is deterministic , leading to stationarity and mixing properties of the sequence @xmath118 and to a relatively simple analysis of their tail properties .",
    "both these features are lost for @xmath15 .",
    "a ( by now standard ) approach to homogenization problems is to consider the _ environment viewed from the particle_. more precisely , with @xmath119 denoting the @xmath120 shift by @xmath6 , the process @xmath121 is a markov chain with state - space @xmath5 . whenever the invariant measure of this chain is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath10 , law of large numbers and clt s",
    "can be deduced , see @xcite . for reversible situations , e.g. in the `` random conductance model '' @xcite , the invariant measure of the chain @xmath122",
    "is known explicitly . in the non - reversible rwre model",
    ", this approach has had limited consequences : one needs to establish absolute continuity of the invariant measure without knowing it explicitly .",
    "this was done in @xcite for balanced environments , i.e. whenever @xmath123 @xmath10-a.s . for all @xmath124 , by developing a - priori estimates on the invariant measure . ,",
    "valid for _ every _ realization of the environment .",
    "apart from that ( and the very recent @xcite ) , this approach has not been very useful in the study of rwre s .",
    "we focus here on another approach based on analogs of hitting times . throughout , fix a direction @xmath125 , and consider the process @xmath126 . define the events @xmath127 .",
    "then , with @xmath10 a product measure , one shows that @xmath128 , @xcite .",
    "we sketch a proof : call a time @xmath129 _ fresh _ if @xmath130 , and for any fresh time @xmath129 , define the return time @xmath131 , calling @xmath129 a regeneration time if @xmath132 . then",
    ", @xmath133 implies by the markov property that @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , on @xmath135 , each fresh time has a bounded away from zero probability to be a regeneration time .",
    "one deduces that @xmath136 . in particular , on @xmath137 , @xmath138 changes signs only finitely many times . if @xmath139 then with positive probability , @xmath138 visits a finite centered interval infinitely often , and hence it must change signs infinitely many times . but",
    "this implies that @xmath140 .",
    "the proof above can be extended to non - product @xmath10-s having good mixing properties using , due to the uniform ellipticity , a coupling with simple nearest neighbor random walk .",
    "this is done as follows : set @xmath141 .",
    "define the measure @xmath142 in the following way : @xmath143 is a product measure , such that with @xmath144 denoting an element of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 . for each fixed @xmath149",
    ", @xmath150 is the law of the markov chain @xmath13 with state space @xmath120 , such that @xmath151 and , for each @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154\\,.\\ ] ] it is not hard to check that the law of @xmath13 under @xmath155 coincides with its law under @xmath22 , while its law under @xmath156 coincides with its law under @xmath57 .",
    "now , one introduces modified regeneration times @xmath157 by requiring that after the fresh time @xmath129 , the `` @xmath158 '' coin was used for @xmath159 steps in the direction @xmath160 : more precisely , requiring that @xmath161 for some fixed sequence @xmath162 such that @xmath163 .",
    "this , for large @xmath159 , introduces enough decoupling to carry through the proof , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) .",
    "we can now state the : + * embarrassing problem 1 * prove that @xmath164 .    for @xmath165 , and @xmath10 i.i.d .",
    ", this was shown in @xcite , where counter examples using non uniformly elliptic , ergodic @xmath10 s are also provided .",
    "the case @xmath166 , even for @xmath10 i.i.d .",
    ", remains open .",
    "the most promising approach so far toward problem 2 uses regeneration times .",
    "write @xmath167 for the ordered sequence of regeneration times , assuming that @xmath168 .",
    "the name regeneration time is justified by the following property , which for simplicity we state in the case @xmath169 :      from this statement , it is then not hard to deduce that once @xmath171 , a law of large numbers results , with a non - zero limiting velocity .",
    "sufficient conditions for transience put forward in @xcite turn out to fall in this class , see @xcite .",
    "more recently , sznitman has introduced a condition that ensures both a lln and a clt :      a remarkable fact about sznitman s t condition is that he was able to derive , using renormalization techniques , a ( rather complicated ) criterion , depending on the restriction of @xmath10 to finite boxes , to check it .",
    "further , sznitman s t condition implies a good control on @xmath175 , and in particular that @xmath175 possesses all moments , which is the key to the lln and clt statements : @xmath176 for these , and related , facts see @xcite .",
    "this leads one to the      for @xmath16 , the answer is affirmative , as we saw , as soon as @xmath177 but @xmath178 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "one suspects that the answer is negative , and in fact one may suspect that @xmath168 implies sznitman s condition t. the reason for the striking difference is that for @xmath15 , it is much harder to force the walk to visit large traps .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the modified regeneration times @xmath179 can be used to deduce the lln for a class of mixing environments .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details . at present",
    ", the question of clt s in such a general set up remains open .",
    "regeneration times are less useful if the walk is not ballistic . special cases of non - ballistic models have been analyzed in the above mentioned @xcite , and using a heavy renormalization analysis , in @xcite for the case of symmetric , low disorder , i.i.d .",
    "@xmath10 . in both cases , lln s with zero speed and clt",
    "s are provided .",
    "we now introduce , for another special class of models , a different class of times that are not regeneration times but provide enough decoupling to lead to useful consequences .",
    "the setup is similar to that in theorem [ theo-2 ] , that is we assume that @xmath35 and that the rwre , in its first 5 coordinate , performs a deterministic random walk : + @xmath180 + set @xmath181 , let @xmath182 denote a ( biased ) simple random walk in @xmath183 with transition probabilities @xmath184 , and fix a sequence of independent bernoulli random variable with @xmath185 , letting @xmath186 .",
    "denote by @xmath187 the first 5 components of @xmath40 and by @xmath188 the remaining components .",
    "then , for every realization @xmath189 , the rwre @xmath40 can be constructed as the markov chain with @xmath190 and transition probabilities @xmath191 introduce now , for the walk @xmath192 , cut times @xmath193 as those times where the past and future of the path @xmath192 do not intersect . more precisely , with @xmath194 , @xmath195 the cut - points sequence depends on the ordinary random walk @xmath192 only . in particular , because that walk evolves in @xmath183 , it follows , as in @xcite , that there are infinitely many cut points , and moreover that they have a positive density .",
    "further , the increments @xmath196 depend on disjoint parts of the environment . therefore ,",
    "conditioned on @xmath197 , they are independent if @xmath10 is a product measure , and they possess good mixing properties if @xmath10 has good mixing properties . from here",
    ", the statement of theorem [ theo-2 ] is not too far .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , where this and clt statements ( with 5 replaced by a larger integer ) are proved . an amusing consequence of @xcite is that for @xmath198 , one may construct ballistic rwre s with , in the notations of section [ section 2 ] , @xmath199 !          we conclude the discussion of multi - dimensional rwre s by mentioning large deviations for this model . call a rwre _ nestling _ if @xmath200 , where @xmath111 denotes the law of @xmath201 . in words ,",
    "an rwre is nestling if by combining local drifts one can arrange for zero drift .",
    "one has then :      the proof of theorem [ theo - zerner ] involves hitting times : let @xmath202 denote the first hitting time of @xmath203 .",
    "one then checks , using the subaddititve ergodic theorem , that @xmath204 exists and is deterministic , for @xmath205 . in the nestling regime",
    ", where slowdown has sub - exponential decay rate due to the existence of traps much as for @xmath16 , this and concentration of measure estimates are enough to yield the ldp . but :          one does not expect a relation as simple as in theorem [ theo-4 ] , because the rwre can avoid traps by contouring them , and to change the environment in a way that surely modifies the behavior of the walk by time @xmath101 has probability which seems to decay at an exponential rate faster than @xmath101 .",
    "this puts the muti - dimensional rwre in an intermediate position between the one - dimensional rwre and walks on galton - watson trees @xcite .",
