    "uninterrupted series of successes of quantum mechanics support a belief that quantum formalism applies to all of physical reality .",
    "thus , in particular , the objective classical world of everyday experience should emerge naturally from the formalism .",
    "this has been a long - standing problem , in fact already present from the very dawn of quantum mechanics ( see e.g. the writings of bohr @xcite and heisenberg @xcite for some of the earlier discussions and e.g. @xcite for some of the modern approaches , relevant to the present work ) .",
    "perhaps the most promising approach is decoherence theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) , based on a system - environment paradigm : a quantum system is considered not in an isolation , but rather interacting with its environment .",
    "it recovers , under certain conditions , a classical - like behavior of the system alone in some preferred frame , singled out by the interaction and called a _",
    "pointer basis _ , and explains it through information leakage from the system to the environment ( the system is  monitored  by its environment )",
    ".    however , as zurek noticed recently @xcite , decoherence theory is silent on how comes that in the classical realm information is _",
    "redundant_same record can exist in a large number of copies and can be independently accessed by many observers and many times .",
    "to overcome the problem , he has introduced a more realistic model of environment , composed of a number of independent fractions , and argued using several models ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) that after the decoherence has taken place , each of these fractions carries a nearly complete classical information about the system .",
    "then zurek argues that this huge information redundancy implies objective existence @xcite .",
    "this model , called quantum darwinism , although very attractive ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some experimental evidence ) , has a certain gap which make its foundations not very clear . postponing the details to section [ qdcond ] , the criterion used in quantum darwinism to show the information redundancy",
    "is motivated by _ entirely classical _ reasoning and a priori may not work as intended in the quantum world .",
    "there is however another basic question : is there a fundamental physical process , consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics , which leads to the appearance in the environment of multiple copies of a state of the system ?",
    "in other words , how does nature create a  bridge  from fragile quantum states , which can not be cloned @xcite , to robust classical objectivity ?",
    "zurek is aware of the difficulty when he writes @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  quantum darwinism leads to appearance in the environment of multiple copies of the state of the system .",

    "this is the essence of _ state broadcasting_a process aimed at proliferating a given state through correlated copies @xcite . in this work",
    "we identify a weaker form of state broadcasting_spectrum broadcasting _ , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the fundamental physical process , consistent with quantum mechanical laws , which leads to the perceived objectivity of classical information , and as a result recover quantum darwinism ( as a limiting point ) .",
    "we do it first in full generality , using a definition of objective existence due to zurek @xcite and bohr s notion of non - disturbance @xcite .",
    "then , in one of the emblematic examples of decoherence theory and quantum darwinism : a small dielectric sphere illuminated by photons ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the recognition of the underlying spectrum broadcasting mechanism has been possible due to a paradigmatic shift in the core object of the analysis . from a partial state of the system ( decoherence theory ) or information - theoretical quantities like mutual information ( quantum darwinism ) to a full quantum state of the system and the observed environment .",
    "this also opens a possibility for direct experimental tests using e.g. quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "what does it mean that something _",
    "objectively exists _",
    "? what does it mean for information ?",
    "for the purpose of this study we employ the definition from ref .",
    "@xcite :    [ obj ] a state of the system @xmath0 exists objectively if ",
    "[ ... ] many observers can find out the state of @xmath0 independently , and without perturbing it .     in what follows we will try to make this definition as precise as possible and investigate its consequences .",
    "the natural setting for this is quantum darwinism @xcite : the quantum system of interest @xmath0 interacts with multiple environments @xmath1 ( denoted collectively as @xmath2 ) , also modeled as quantum systems .",
    "the environments ( or their collections ) are monitored by independent observers ( _ environmental observers _ ) and here we do not assume symmetric environments  they can be all different .",
    "the system - environment interaction is such that it leads to a full decoherence : there exists a time scale @xmath3 , called _ decoherence time _",
    ", such that asymptotically for interaction times @xmath4 : i ) there emerges a unique , stable in time preferred basis @xmath5 , so called _ pointer basis _",
    ", in the system s hilbert space ; ii ) the reduced state of the system @xmath6 becomes stable and diagonal in the preferred basis : [ decoh ] _ s_e_s : e_i p_i | i i , where @xmath7 s are some probabilities and by @xmath8 we will always denote asymptotic equality in the deep decoherence limit @xmath9 . we emphasize that we assume here the _ full decoherence _",
    ", so that the system decoheres in a basis rather than in higher - dimensional pointer superselection sectors ( decoherence - free subspaces ) .",
    "coming back to the definition [ obj ] , we first add an important _ stability requirement _ : the observers can find out the state of @xmath0 without perturbing it _ repeatedly and arbitrary many times_. in our view , this captures well the intuitive feeling of objectivity as something stable in time rather than fluctuating .",
    "thus , if definition [ obj ] is to be non - empty , it should be understood in the time - asymptotic and hence decoherence regime , which in turn implies that the state of @xmath0 which can possibly exist objectively , is determined by the decohered state ( [ decoh ] ) .",
    "we will show it on a concrete example we study later .",
    "next , we specify the observers . apart from the environmental ones , we also allow for a , possibly only hypothetical , _ direct observer _ , who can measure @xmath0 directly .",
    "we feel such a observer is needed as a reference , to verify that the findings of the environmental observers are the same as if one had a direct access to the system .",
    "it is clear that what the observers can determine are the eigenvalues @xmath7 of the decohered state ( [ decoh])they otherwise know the pointer basis @xmath5 , as if not , they would not know what the information they get is about . hence , the  state  in definition [ obj ] , which gains the objective existence , is the  classical part  of the decohered state ( [ decoh ] ) , i.e. its spectrum @xmath10 .    the word  find out  we interpret as the observers performing von neumann ( as more informative than generalized ) measurements on their subsystems .",
    "by the  independence  condition , they act independently , i.e. there can be no correlations between the measurements and the corresponding projectors must be fully product : [ prod ] ^m_s_i^m_1_j_1^m_n_j_n , where all @xmath11 s are mutually orthogonal hermitian projectors , @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "now the crucial word  perturbation  needs to be made precise .",
    "the debate about its meaning has been actually at the very heart of quantum mechanics from its beginnings , starting from the famous work of einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite and the response of bohr @xcite .",
    "it is quite intriguing that this debate appears in the context of objectivity .",
    "the exact definitions of the epr and bohr notions of non - disturbance are still a subject of some debate and we adopt here their formalizations from ref .",
    "@xcite : the sufficient condition for the epr non - disturbance is the _ no - signaling principle _ , stating that the partial state of one subsystem is insensitive to measurements performed on the other subsystem ( after forgetting the results ) @xcite . quantum mechanics obeys the no - signaling principle , but bohr argued that the epr s notion is too permissive , as it only prohibits  mechanical  disturbance , and proposed a stricter one , which can be formally stated @xcite that the whole _",
    "state must stay invariant under local measurements on one subsystem ( after forgetting the results ) .",
    "for the purpose of this study we adopt bohr s point of view , adapted to our particular situation  we assume that _ neither of the observers bohr - disturbs the rest _ ( in the @xmath14 direction it is our formalization of the definition [ obj ] , while in the @xmath15 it follows from the repetitivity requirement ) . together with the product structure ( [ prod ] ) , this implies that on each @xmath16 there exists a _",
    "non - disturbing measurement _ , which leaves the whole asymptotic state @xmath17 of the system and the observed environment invariant ( we will specify the size of the observed environment later ) . for the system",
    "@xmath0 it is obviously defined by the projectors on the pointer basis @xmath5 , as by assumption this is the only basis preserved by the dynamics . for the environments we allow for a general higher - rank projectors",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and not necessarily spanning the whole space , as the environments can : i ) have inner degrees of freedom not correlating to @xmath0 and ii ) correlate to @xmath0 only through some subspaces of their hilbert spaces ( we will later encounter such a situation in the concrete example ) .    when more than one observer preform the non - disturbing measurements , a further specification of bohr - nondisturbance is needed .",
    "allowing for general correlations @xmath20 $ ] may lead to a disagreement : if one of the observers measures first , the ones measuring afterwards may find outcomes depending on the result of the first measurement ( if the observers do not discard their results an meet to compare them later ) .",
    "this can hardly be called objectivity and we thus add to the definition [ obj ] an obvious _ agreement requirement _ :  ... observers can find out the _ same _ state of @xmath0 independently , ...  , leading to a natural conclusion @xcite : [ agree ] (  p_ij_1 ",
    "j_n0   i = j_1= ... =j_n  ) p_ii  i=1 , i.e. the environmental bohr - nondisturbing measurements must be _ perfectly correlated _ with the pointer basis .",
    "hence , after forgetting the results , the asymptotic post - measurement state @xmath21 reads ( by @xmath22 we denote @xmath23 asymptotic ) : & & ^m_s : e()=_i , j_1 ,  , j_np_ij_1",
    " j_n_ij_1 ",
    "j_n^s : e()= + & & _ i ii_i_s : e()ii_i , where @xmath24 .",
    "now we are ready for _ the crucial step _ : we impose the relevant form of the bohr - nondisturbance condition : [ maxcorr ] _",
    "i ii_i_s : e()ii_i=_s : e ( ) , whose only solution @xcite are the , so called , classical - quantum ( cq ) states @xcite : [ wism ] _ s : e()=_i p_i ii^e_i , where @xmath7 are the probabilities from eq .",
    "( [ decoh ] ) and @xmath25 are some residual states in the space of all the environments with mutually orthogonal supports : @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "hence , @xmath28 are perfectly distinguishable @xcite through the assumed non - disturbing measurements @xmath29 , projecting on their supports .",
    "the derived form ( [ wism ] ) sheds some light on the word ",
    "many  in the definition [ obj ] : the compatible states ( [ wism ] ) are necessarily @xmath30 separable , while we argue that _ generically _ , for large systems , the unitary system - environment evolution @xmath31 leads to @xmath30 entanglement ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for the definition of the latter ) .",
    "we first recall that the initial states , weather pure or mixed , are always assumed to be @xmath30 product  the system and the environment did not interact in the remote past and there is _ no prior information _ about the system in the environment .",
    "the entanglement generation is then clear for pure initial states , as entanglement is the only form of correlation for such states and without a @xmath30 correlation there can be no decoherence ( [ decoh ] ) . for mixed initial states",
    "the situation is more subtle as in finite - dimensional state - spaces there exist non - zero volume separable balls around the identity operator @xcite . if the @xmath30 state is initially in this ball , the unitary evolution will not lead it out of it , while building enough correlations for the decoherence ( [ decoh ] ) to happen .",
    "however , for large dimensions , the radius of the largest separable ball decreases as @xmath32 @xcite and for infinite - dimensional spaces becomes strictly zero ( see e.g. ref .",
    "this is the case here : the environment must be of a large dimension if it is to have a large informational capacity , needed to carry a large number of copies of a state of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the @xmath30 entanglement is generically produced during the evolution , as hitting the separable ball becomes highly unprobable due to its vanishing measure .",
    "the only way then to eventually obtain a separable state from an entangled one is by forgetting subsystems  some portions of the environment pass unobserved , as it is actually always the case in reality .",
    "thus , slightly abusing the language and identifying observers with the fractions of the environment they observe , we can interpret  many  as sufficiently many but not all  some loss of information is necessary . in",
    "what follows the total observed fraction of the environment will be denoted by @xmath33 or @xmath34 ( depending on the context ) and all the states above should be understood as @xmath35 .",
    "finally , let us look at the residual states @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ wism ] ) .",
    "we comeback to the demand of independent ability to determine the state of @xmath0 , already used in eq .",
    "( [ prod ] ) , and we further interpret it as a _ strong independence _ : _ the only correlation between the environments should be the common information about the system_. in other words , conditioned by the information about the system , there should be no correlations between the environments .",
    "thus , once one of the observers finds a particular result @xmath36 , the conditional state should be fully product .",
    "since the direct observer is already uncorrelated by eq .",
    "( [ wism ] ) , this implies that : _",
    "i^fe=^e_1_i^e_fn_i . and the states @xmath37 must be perfectly distinguishable for each environment @xmath38 independently : [ distng ] ^e_k_i^e_k_i=0  ii , since by the bohr - nondisturbance ( [ maxcorr ] ) for any @xmath39 it holds @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath27 .",
    "gathering all the above facts together , we finally obtain : if there is a decoherence mechanism that asymptotically leads to an objectively existing state of @xmath0 in the sense of definition [ obj ] , then the asymptotic joint state of the system and the observed environment fraction ( after the necessary tracing out of some of the environment ) must be of a special classical - classical @xcite form : @xmath42 where all @xmath37 satisfy ( [ distng ] ) .    from the quantum information point of view",
    ", state ( [ br2 ] ) is a final state of a process similar to _ quantum state broadcasting _ @xcite .",
    "the latter is a task ( described by a linear map ) , which aims at producing from a given state @xmath43 a multipartite state @xmath44 , called an n - party broadcast state for @xmath43 , such that for every reduction @xmath45 , thus proliferating @xmath43 , but in a more subtle manner then by cloning .",
    "remarkably there is a weaker form of broadcasting , _ spectrum broadcasting _",
    "@xcite  a task aiming at proliferating merely a spectrum of a quantum state , or equivalently a classical probability distribution .",
    "we define it as follows : @xmath46 is a spectrum broadcast state for @xmath43 , with @xmath47 , if for every reduction @xmath38 there exist encoding states @xmath37 such that : _",
    "e_1  e_k ",
    "e_n^s - br_e_1 ",

    "a spectrum broadcast state @xmath46 allows then one to locally recover perfect copies of the spectrum @xmath48 ( through the projective measurements of the supports of @xmath37)the spectrum is _",
    "redundantly proliferated_. this is clearly the case of the state ( [ br2 ] ) due to the distinguishability ( [ distng ] ) : ( [ br2 ] ) is a spectrum broadcast state for the decohered state ( [ decoh ] ) .",
    "condition ( [ distng ] ) forces the correlations in ( [ br2 ] ) to be entirely classical and thus the detailed structures of @xmath37 ( e.g. their ranks ) become irrelevant for the correlations .",
    "one can even pass to the purifications @xmath49 @xcite of @xmath37 , which by ( [ distng ] ) will be mutually orthogonal for @xmath27 . in the equivalent language of quantum channels @xcite , the redundant classical information transfer from the system to the observed environment is asymptotically described by a @xmath50-type channel defined by ( [ br2 ] ) @xcite",
    ".    the result ( [ br2 ] ) can be then re - stated as : in the presence of decoherence , spectrum broadcasting is a necessary condition for objective existence , in the sense of definition [ obj ] , of the classical state of @xmath0 ( = the spectrum of ( [ decoh ] ) ) . in other words ,",
    "if a decoherence mechanism leads to a redundant production of classical information records about the system , and hence to objectively existing classical state of @xmath0 , it is necessarily achieved ( in the asymptotic limit ) through spectrum broadcasting .",
    "conversely , a spectrum broadcasting process resulting in a state ( [ br2 ] ) ( with the crucial property ( [ distng ] ) ) leads to the objective existence in the sense of definition [ obj ] of the classical state @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , projections on the pointer basis @xmath5 and on the disjoint supports of @xmath37 constitute the preferred , non - disturbing measurements . performing them independently",
    ", the observers will all detect the same probability distribution @xmath10 without bohr - disturbing the quantum state of the system ( [ decoh ] ) and the measurements can be repeated arbitrary many times .    summarizing , under the assumptions elaborated above ,",
    "we have proven the following implications , identifying spectrum broadcasting as the physical process responsible for the appearance of the classical objectivity : @xmath51 we also note that the form ( [ br2 ] ) resolves the apparent puzzle appearing within quantum darwinism @xcite and mentioned in the introduction : how can multiple information records be produced during a quantum evolution when state cloning is forbidden in quantum mechanics @xcite ?",
    "the answer from ( [ br2 ] ) is that : i ) only state s spectrum is proliferated and ii ) instead of clones rather _ classically correlated copies _ are produced .",
    "it may seem that by the time - stability requirement of objectivity , our reasoning may exclude time evolving classical objective states and lead to the classical zeno paradox .",
    "this is however not so .",
    "moving outside the strict decoherence framework , within which our results have been derived , one can allow for a changing in time pointer basis @xmath52 , and hence probabilities @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "( [ decoh ] ) ) , but evolving on a much slower time - scale than that of the decoherence .",
    "this is the case in most of the realistic situations , as the decoherence time - scales are usually very short , and it opens the possibility for objectively existing , time - evolving classical states @xmath54 iff the spectrum broadcast state ( [ br2 ] ) is formed fast enough for every @xmath55 .    as a final touch , we quote the results of refs .",
    "@xcite on the epistemological versus ontological interpretation of a quantum state itself : under suitable assumptions , a state of a quantum system is a _ property of the system _ rather than a state of knowledge about it .",
    "this somewhat strengthens our result and justifies the use of quantum states for studying objective existence : the latter gains a certain ontological status , as it intuitively should .",
    "in the studies of quantum darwinism the objective existence has been so far argued based on a single functional condition , which we will call _ quantum darwinism condition _ ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) : [ zurek ] i(_s : fe)=h_s , where @xmath56 is the quantum mutual information , @xmath57 stands for the von neumann entropy , and @xmath58=h(\\{p_i\\})$ ] is the entropy of the decohered state ( [ decoh ] ) .",
    "condition ( [ zurek ] ) has been shown to hold in several models , including environments comprised of photons @xcite and spins ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for finite times",
    "@xmath55 , the equality ( [ zurek ] ) is not strict and holds within some error @xmath59 , which defines the _ redundancy _ @xmath60 as the inverse of the smallest fraction of the environment @xmath61 , for which @xmath62=[1-\\delta(t)]h_s$ ] .",
    "when satisfied , ( [ zurek ] ) implies that the mutual information between the system and the environment fraction is a constant function of the fraction size @xmath33 ( up to an error @xmath63 for finite times ) and the plot of @xmath64 against @xmath33 exhibits a characteristic plateau , called the _ classical plateau _ ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the appearance of this plateau has been heuristically explained in the quantum darwinism literature as a consequence of the _ redundancy _ : classical information about the system exists in many copies in the environment fractions and can be accessed independently and without perturbing the system by many observers , thus leading to objective existence of a state of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "those far reaching statements has been based only on the condition ( [ zurek ] ) .",
    "but the motivation behind using ( [ zurek ] ) to prove the objective existence is somewhat doubtful as it comes solely from the classical world @xcite : in the classical information science condition ( [ zurek ] ) is equivalent to a perfect correlation of both systems @xcite .",
    "that is one system has a full information about the other and indeed in a multipartite setting this information thus exists objectively , in accord with the definition [ obj ] .",
    "but in the quantum world the situation is very different @xcite : surprisingly , quantum darwinism condition ( [ zurek ] ) alone _ is not sufficient _ to guarantee objectivity in the sense of definition [ obj ] ( see also ref .  @xcite in this context ) .",
    "it is clear that the spectrum broadcast states ( [ br2 ] ) satisfy ( [ zurek ] ) , but there are also _ entangled _ states satisfying it , thus violating the form ( [ br2 ] ) , derived from the definition [ obj ] as a necessary condition for objectivity . as a simple example consider the following state of two qubits : _",
    "abp p_(a| 00 + b| 11 ) + ( 1-p)p_(a| 01 + b| 10 ) , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then the partial state @xmath69 , @xmath70 is diagonal in the basis @xmath71 and moreover @xmath72 ( the binary shannon entropy @xcite ) , so that the quantum darwinism condition holds : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , but the systems are nevertheless entangled , which one verifies directly through the ppt criterion @xcite .",
    "thus , by the results of the previous section , we argue that the functional criterion ( [ zurek ] ) is not enough and the objective existence , as defined by definition [ obj ] , should be proven at the _ structural _ level of quantum sates .",
    "in particular , if the spectrum broadcasting form ( [ br2 ] ) can be asymptotically derived in a given model , this will guarantee the objective existence . the paradigmatic shift with respect to the earlier works on decoherence theory and quantum darwinism we propose here ,",
    "is that the core object of the analysis should be the structure of the full quantum state of the system @xmath0 and the observed environment @xmath34 , rather than the partial state of the system only ( decoherence theory ) or information - theoretical functions ( quantum darwinism ) .",
    "below we present such a state - based analysis and explicitly derive spectrum broadcasting states in the emblematic example for decoherence theory and quantum darwinism : a small dielectric sphere illuminated by photons ( see e.g. refs .",
    "of radius @xmath75 and relative permittivity @xmath76 is illuminated by a constant flux of photons ( represented by green spots ) .",
    "the photons constitute the environments @xmath2 of the sphere .",
    "the sphere can be at two possible locations @xmath77 and @xmath78 , separated by a distance @xmath79 , much larger than the effective photon wavelengths @xmath80 .",
    "photons scatter elastically and slightly differently depending on where the sphere is , but this difference is vanishingly small for each individual scattering  the information about the sphere s position is diluted in the photonic environment . however , when grouped into macroscopic fractions , the photons become collectively almost perfectly resolving and the classical information about the sphere becomes available in the environment in multiple copies .",
    "we calculate the full post - scattering state of the sphere and a macroscopic fraction of the photons in the dipole approximation @xmath81 and show that this redundant proliferation of information is described by spectrum broadcasting ( [ br2 ] ) . for technical reasons , we use box normalization : the sphere and the photons are enclosed in a large cubic box of edge @xmath82 and the photon momentum eigenstates @xmath83 obey periodic boundary conditions . [ general ] ]    we first introduce the model , following the usual treatment ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the system @xmath0 is a sphere of radius @xmath75 and relative permittivity @xmath76 , bombarded by a constant flux of photons , which constitute the multiple environments ( see fig .  [ general ] ) and decohere the sphere .",
    "the sphere can be located only at two positions : @xmath77 or @xmath78 , so that effectively its state - space is that of a qubit @xmath84 with a preferred orthonormal ( due to the mutual exclusiveness ) basis @xmath85 , @xmath86 , which will become the pointer basis .",
    "this greatly simplifies the analysis , yet allows the essence of the effect to be observed .",

    "@xcite , a significantly weaker form of quantum state broadcasting , as the fundamental quantum process , which leads to objectively existing classical information . more specifically , adopting the multiple environments paradigm , the suitable definition of objectivity ( definition [ obj ] ) , and bohr s notion of non - disturbance ,",
    "we have proven that the only possible process which makes transition from quantum state information to the classical objectivity is spectrum broadcasting .",
    "this process constitutes a formal framework and a physical foundation for the quantum darwinism model , which , as we have pointed out , in its information - theoretical form does not produce a sufficient condition for objectivity , since it allows for entanglement .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of decoherence , spectrum broadcasting is a necessary and sufficient condition for the objective existence of a classical state of the system .",
    "it filters a quantum state and then broadcasts its spectrum i.e. a classical probability distribution , in multiple copies into the environment , making it accessible to the observers . in the picture of quantum channels ,",
    "this redundant classical information transfer from the system to the environments is described by a cc - type channel .",
    "we have illustrated spectrum broadcasting process on the emblematic example for decoherence theory : a small dielectric sphere embedded in a photonic environment .",
    "in particular , we have explicitly shown the asymptotic formation of a spectrum broadcasting state for both pure and general ( not necessarily thermal ) mixed photon environments .",
    "then , we have derived in the asymptotic limit of deep decoherence the information - theoretical phase diagram of the model .",
    "depending on the observed macroscopic fraction @xmath33 of the environment , it shows three phases : the product , broadcasting and full information phase , and is a complete agreement ( up to some error @xmath63 for finite times ) with the classical plateau of the original quantum darwinism studies .",
    "there are two phase transitions taking place : i ) from the product phase to the broadcasting phase ( at @xmath211 ; ii ) from the broadcasting phase ( @xmath162 ) to the full information phase ( at @xmath163 ) , when the observed environment becomes quantumly correlated with the system .",
    "in addition , we have pointed out that a special form spectrum broadcasting  the perron - frobenius broadcasting , can be used to faithfully ( in the asymptotic limit ) broadcast certain classical message through the noisy environment fractions .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", our work opens a possibility to develop an experimentally friendly framework for testing quantum darwinism .",
    "our central object , the broadcast state ( [ br2 ] ) , is in principle directly observable through e.g. quantum state tomography  a well developed , successful , and widely used technique .",
    "in contrast , the original quantum darwinism condition ( [ zurek ] ) relies on the quantum mutual information and it is not clear how to measure it .",
    "we finish with a series of general remarks and questions .",
    "first , there is a straightforward generalization of the illuminated sphere model to a situation where classical correlations are spectrum broadcasted @xcite .",
    "consider several spheres , each with its own photonic environment , and separated by distances @xmath212 much larger than the photon wavelengths , @xmath213 ( cf .",
    "( [ soft ] ) ) .",
    "the effective interaction is then a product of the unitaries ( [ u ] ) , e.g. : u_s_1s_2:e_1e_2(t)_i , j=1,2| x_i x_i || y_j y_j | _ i^n_t_j^n_t , for two spheres , where @xmath214 are the spheres positions and @xmath215 are the corresponding scattering matrices , and the asymptotic spectrum broadcast state carries now the joint probability , e.g. @xmath216 ( cf . eq  ( [ pi ] ) ) .",
    "it is measurable by observers , who have an access to photon macro - fractions , originating from all the spheres .",
    "second , in the example we have studied , and in the majority of decoherence models @xcite , the system - environment interaction hamiltonian is of a product form : [ hint ] h_int = g a_s _ k=1^n x_e_k , where @xmath217 is a coupling constant and @xmath218 are some observables on the system and the environments respectively .",
    "the pointer basis appears then trivially as the eigenbasis of @xmath219it is arguably put by hand by the choice of @xmath220 .",
    "it is then an interesting question if there are more general interaction hamiltonians , without a priori chosen pointer basis , which nevertheless lead to an asymptotic formation of a spectrum broadcast state : [ br3 ] _ s : fe(t)_i",
    "i i |_k _ i^e_k ,   ^e_k_i^e_k_ii=0 .",
    "are there _ truly dynamical _ mechanisms leading to stable pointer bases and objective classical states ?    viewing eq .",
    "( [ br3 ] ) form a different angle , we note that spectrum broadcasting defines a split of information contained in the quantum state @xmath221 into classical and quantum parts .",
    "as it is well known , every quantum state can be convexly decomposed in many ways into mixtures of pure states , so a priori such a split does not exist .",
    "some additional process is needed .",
    "spectrum broadcasting is an example of it : by correlating to the preferred basis @xmath5 , it endows the corresponding probabilities @xmath222 with objective existence , in the sense of definition [ obj ] , and defines them as a `` classical part '' of @xmath6 , leaving the states @xmath223 as a `` quantum part '' ( cf .",
    "no - local - broadcasting theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "third , there appears to be a deep connection between the non - signaling principle and objective existence in the sense of definition [ obj ] : the core fact that it is at all possible for observers to determine _ independently _ the classical state of the system is guaranteed by the non - signaling principle : @xmath224 .",
    "there is no contradiction with the bohr - nondisturbance , as the latter is a strictly _ stronger _ condition than the non - signaling @xcite(this is the core of bohr s reply @xcite to epr ) .",
    "in fact , the above connection reaches deeper than quantum mechanics . in a general theory , where it is possible to speak of probabilities @xmath225 of obtaining results @xmath226 when performing measurements @xmath227 ( however defined ) , whatever the definition of objective existence may be , the requirement of the _ independent _ ability to locally determine probabilities by each party seem indispensable .",
    "this is guaranteed in the non - signaling theories , where all @xmath225 s have well defined marginals . in this sense",
    "non - signaling seems a _ prerequisite of cognition_. this connection will be the subject of a further research .",
    "finally , one may speculate on a relevance of our results for life processes . already in 1961 ,",
    "wigner tried to argue that the standard quantum formalism does not allow for the self - replication of biological systems @xcite .",
    "it seemed to be confirmed by the famous no cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "however , now we see that cloning is not the only possibility .",
    "as we have shown , spectrum broadcasting implies a redundant replication of classical information in the environment .",
    "this is indispensable for the existence of life : one of the most fundamental processes of life is watson - crick alkali encoding of genetic information into the dna molecule and self - replication of the dna information",
