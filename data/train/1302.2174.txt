    "the properties of small scales structures in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) and hall - magnetohydrodynamic ( hmhd ) turbulence have been the subject of conflicting results and of several debates . in particular ,",
    "much attention has been paid in the literature to the geometrical properties of current sheets in hmhd , as these structures are associated with magnetic flux reconnection and magnetic energy dissipation , processes of uttermost importance in astrophysics and space physics @xcite .",
    "while some numerical simulations indicate that current sheets affected by the hall effect are wider than in mhd ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , others observe thinner structures @xcite in all cases , the geometry of the currents sheets is changed , displaying the so - called x - type structure and reminiscent of the sweet - parker configuration in the mhd case @xcite , and changing to a double wedge shape reminiscent of the petschek configuration when the hall effect is relevant @xcite . in simulations of turbulent hmhd , it was observed that the peak of the spectrum of the current density was located at a wavenumber corresponding to the inverse of the ion skin depth @xcite . since this peak",
    "can be associated with an average thickness of the current sheets , the effect was interpreted as a thickening of the current sheets as the hall effect was increased @xcite .",
    "the result is in good agreements with experiments that indicate that the thickness of the current sheet in the presence of the hall effect is given by the ion skin depth @xcite .    ref .",
    "@xcite provides a possible answer to these conflicting results . in simulations of turbulent hmhd with a guide field",
    ", the authors observe that although the current sheet widens as the ion skin depth is increased , it also fragments internally into smaller filaments .",
    "the case in which thinner structures were observed @xcite suggests that hmhd is more intermittent than mhd .",
    "this is also the case in some observations in the solar wind turbulence using the cluster magnetic data @xcite .",
    "however , other observations in the solar wind of high - frequency magnetic field fluctuations from the same spacecraft indicate that while large scales are compatible with multifractal intermittent turbulence , small scales show non - gaussian monoscaling @xcite .",
    "a quantification of the level of intermittency is important to understand the geometrical distribution of dissipation in a magnetofluid and a plasma , and it also can provide constraints for theories of magnetic energy dissipation and reconnection .",
    "while previous analysis of intermittency in hmhd were mostly based on the differences observed in the geometry and size of current sheets , or in the study of probability density functions ( pdfs ) of field increments at different scales , a precise quantification requires computation of both pdfs and of structure functions .",
    "the study of intermittency based solely on observations of individual structures has several shortcomings .",
    "although the formation of small scale structures can point out to an increase in the level of intermittency , there is more information that is needed to make such claim .",
    "if there are thinner structures , are these structures spatially localized ? or do they occupy more space than in the mhd case , thus being space filling ? in the former case , hmhd would be more intermittent , while in the latter case intermittency would be decreased by the hall effect .    in this work we present a detailed study of intermittency in the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "considering the solar wind as a motivation , the data for the analysis stems from numerical simulations of mhd and hmhd turbulence with a guide field .",
    "we use the reduced mhd ( rmhd , @xcite ) and reduced hmhd ( rhmhd , @xcite ) models to generate data under the approximation of a strong guide field . then , structure functions and pdfs of the fields are computed , for increments in the direction perpendicular to the guide field . to reduce errors ,",
    "an average of the structure functions for several directions perpendicular to the guide field is computed using the so(2 ) decomposition @xcite .",
    "although at small scales in the solar wind several kinetic effects may play important roles , we found that a simple hall magnetofluid reproduces some of the the observations in @xcite , and that the presence of the hall effect results in a substantial decrease in the intermittency of the velocity and magnetic fields at scales smaller than the ion skin depth .",
    "for a compressible flow , the hmhd equations can be written ( in dimensionless form ) as @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 in these equations , @xmath4 is the velocity field , @xmath5 is the vorticity field , @xmath6 is the current , @xmath7 is the magnetic field , @xmath8 is the density of the plasma , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the magnetic and electric potentials .",

    "the most important control parameter is the hall coefficient @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the ion skin depth and @xmath22 is the characteristic scale of turbulence . when @xmath23 , the equations above result in the well known compressible mhd equations",
    ".    in the presence of a strong guide field , the equations above can be written using the reduced approximation often used in magnetohydrodynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the approximation assumes that the magnetic field can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the intensity of the guide field , and @xmath26 is such that @xmath27 .    we assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath28 , and we decompose the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in terms of scalar potentials as @xmath29 and @xmath30 equation ( [ b1 ] ) ensures that the magnetic fields remains divergence free , while eq .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed in all directions of a cube of side @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the initial correlation length of the fluctuations , defined as the length unit ) .",
    "the runs performed throughout this paper do not contain any magnetic or velocity external stirring terms , so the rhmhd system is let to evolve freely .    to generate the initial conditions , we excite initially fourier modes ( for both magnetic and velocity field fluctuations ) in a shell in @xmath43-space with wavenumbers @xmath44 , with the same amplitude for all modes and with random phases .",
    "only plane - polarized fluctuations ( transverse to the mean magnetic field ) are excited , so the initial conditions are ( low- to high - frequency ) alfvn mode fluctuations with no magnetosonic modes .    in a first set of simulations ,",

    "given the presence of the external magnetic field , it is natural to consider an axisymmetric decomposition for the increments .",

    "we denote increments in this direction as @xmath72 , and we follow the procedure explained in @xcite to average over several directions of @xmath72 .    the method can be described as follows . velocity and magnetic field structure functions were computed from eqs .",

    "recently , it was stressed the need of using well resolved numerical simulations to quantify high order statistics and intermittency in mhd @xcite . in particular , it has been claimed that if the flow is not properly resolved , a partial thermalization of the small scales may result in artificial gaussian statistics and an artificial decrease of the intermittency . considering this , in this section we present results for simulations with the same parameters as in runs a and d , but with larger spatial resolution ( @xmath60 grid points ) .",
    "we will refer to these two runs as runs a2 and d2 .",
    "we computed structure functions , scaling exponents , and pdfs for runs a2 and d2 and compared the results with those found for runs a and d. in all cases , the results were consistent within error bars . as an illustration , in fig .",

    ".    in run a2 , the intermittency exponents are @xmath153 and @xmath154 , consistent within error bars with the values found in run a , while in run d2 the intermittency exponents are @xmath155 and @xmath156 , also consistent with the values obtained in run d.    figure [ fig : fig13 ] shows the pdfs of velocity and magnetic field increments in runs d and d2 , for a spatial increment @xmath144 .",

    "similar results were obtained for runs a and a2 .",
    "when computing the pdfs of spatial derivatives of the fields , we obtained @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 for run a2 , and @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 for run d2 ( compare with the values in table [ table : syk ] for the runs at lower resolution ) .",

    "@xcite argue that for an mhd simulation to be well resolved , the kurtosis of the current should remain independent of the spatial resolution . in our mhd and hmhd",
    "runs that condition is fulfilled , at least up to the level of statistical fluctuations that can be expected when comparing two simulations of a turbulent flow . to verify this , we computed the skewness and kurtosis of the component of the current density parallel to the external magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath165 and @xmath166 . in the mhd simulations ( @xmath23 ) , we obtained @xmath167 and @xmath168 in the simulation with @xmath104 grid points , and @xmath169 and @xmath170 in the simulation with @xmath60 grid points . in the hmhd simulations with @xmath61",
    ", we obtained @xmath171 and @xmath172 in the simulation with @xmath104 grid points , and @xmath173 and @xmath174 in the simulation with @xmath60 grid points .",
    "although there is a small increase in @xmath165 and @xmath166 as the resolution is increased in both the mhd and hmhd runs , the increase is smaller than @xmath175 in most cases . as a result ,",
    "we conclude that the simulations are well resolved even with the more stringent criteria of wan et al .",
    "moreover , the reduction of the intermittency in presence of the hall term is also confirmed by the skewness and kurtosis of the current at both spatial resolutions .    as a result , we conclude that increasing resolution has no significant effect on the results we reported in the previous section , and that the decrease in the intermittency of the flow presented above has its source in the hall effect and not in a numerical artifact when the flow is not properly resolved .",
    "in this work , we presented a study of intermittency in the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations of compressible hall - magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with an external guide field . unlike previous works , we were not interested in the characterization of geometrical properties or in the size of individual structures in the flow ( e.g. , current sheets ) , but rather interested in their overall statistical properties .",
    "the equations were solved numerically using a reduced model valid when a strong guide field is present , and both structure functions and probability density functions of field increments were computed . in the magnetohydrodynamic limit we recovered results found in previous studies , with the magnetic field being more intermittent than the velocity field . however , in the presence of the hall effect , we found field fluctuations at scales smaller than the ion skin depth to be substantially less intermittent , with close to scale - invariant scaling .",
    "as the intensity of the hall effect was increased in the simulations ( i.e. , the ion skin depth was made larger in units of the box size ) , we found both the total energy spectrum and the structure functions to develop a steeper scaling in a wider subinertial range , for all scales smaller than the ion skin depth .",
    "the behavior of the scaling exponents for both the velocity and the magnetic field up to sixth order becomes closer to monofractal as the hall effect is increased , and the intermittency exponent decreases accordingly .    in agreement with these results ,",
    "the probability density functions of longitudinal velocity and magnetic field increments have weaker non - gaussian tails and less asymmetry at scales smaller than the ion skin depth . for velocity and magnetic field gradients",
    ", the skewness and kurtosis also decreases as the hall effect is increased .",
    "these results were obtained for simulations with spatial resolution of @xmath104 grid points , and verified in simulations at larger spatial resolution , with @xmath60 grid points . as a result",
    ", we can safely conclude that increasing resolution has no effect on the results , and that the decrease in the intermittency of the flow has its source in the hall effect .",
