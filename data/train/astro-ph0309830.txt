    "central stars of planetary systems are known to be overabundant in metals ( see for example santos et al . 2001 ; santos et al . 2003 ) .",
    "two scenarios have been suggested to explain such an excess . in the first case ,",
    "the protostellar gas is metal - rich and so is the star .",
    "the high density of heavy elements , compared to stars without planets , increase the probability of planetesimal formation , and thus of planet formation .",
    "the second explanation assumes that planets are formed out of gas with solar like metallicity . the central stars accrete hydrogene poor - matter during and after planetary formation thereby enhancing their metallicitiesin their outer layer ( murray et al .",
    "we suggest that these two scenarios can be tested by asteroseismology . here",
    "we analyse and compare the oscillation frequencies in stellar models with the same external parameters but different histories : with and without accretion .",
    "we computed 1.1 m@xmath0 stars models with the toulouse - geneva code of stellar evolution .",
    "one of them has a high initial metallicity , from the surface to the core , z=0.0443 .",
    "the other model has initial solar abundances but it experienced accretion at the beginning of its main - sequence evolution .",
    "both models include microscopic diffusion .",
    "we adjusted the mass of accreted materia ( m@xmath1 ) , the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath2 ) and the initial helium abundance ( y@xmath3 ) , which are input parameters in our stellar evolution code , in order to obtain stars with the same effective temperature ( t@xmath4 ) , luminosity ( l ) and metallicity ( z ) .",
    "input and output parameters for these models are given in table 1 and table 2 , evolution tracks are represented in figure 1 .",
    "+    the accreted mass is composed of elements heavier than helium with the same relatives abundances as in the sun .",
    "it is given in units of m@xmath5 ( m@xmath5 = 1.9@xmath610@xmath7 kg ) .",
    "when the convergence of two models is obtained , we compute their oscillation frequencies .",

    "as the physical processes in the stars are not the same , the internal structures of models with the same external parameters present detectable differences . in figure 2a we plotted the relative differences of temperature , pression , density and the square of the sound speed for the point on the hr diagram ( see figure 1 ) at which the stars have similar external parameters . in table",
