    "searching for statistical alignments between radio and optical axes is motivated by the desire to find a connection between radio emission mechanism and the geometry of the host galaxy . though there has been a long history of searching for such alignments , generally the results have been inconclusive ( for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in most investigations",
    "there appears to be a slight preponderance of objects where the radio elongation is more aligned with the optical minor axis than the major axis .",
    "the clearest result was obtained by @xcite who found that extended radio jets in 125 ugc galaxies were preferentially aligned with the optical minor axes of their hosts , with the effect being strongest for elliptical galaxies .",
    "recent work indicates that elliptical galaxies have complex kinematics .",
    "these include decoupled cores in a significant fraction of galaxies ( for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the separation of such galaxies into two distinct classes , cored on non - cored ( @xcite ) and/or fast and slow rotators ( @xcite ) . therefore studying the alignment between the stellar population and the radio emission assumes added significance .",
    "all the historic results have been based on relatively small numbers of objects ( @xmath1 100 ) but with the advent of deep radio and optical surveys like first ( @xcite ) and the sdss ( @xcite ) , respectively , it is possible to construct samples with orders of magnitude larger numbers . but",
    "going deeper in radio flux density means that the galaxies identified with the radio sources are no longer dominated by the ellipticals , which were the targets of early studies , but are now a mixture of ellipticals and disk - dominated star - forming galaxies . since the source of the emission is fundamentally different in the two types of galaxy one might well expect their alignment properties also to be different . hence we need to distinguish reliably between early- and late - type galaxies and we do this by using sdss photometry . in this paper",
    "we will focus almost exclusively on radio sources hosted by elliptical galaxies .",
    "we use optical identifications of first radio sources listed in the sdss dr6 database ( @xcite ) which were selected using the procedure defined in @xcite .",
    "there are 239993 such identifications .",
    "we have also extracted the photometric magnitudes from sdss ( @xmath2 ) , the integrated flux density measured by first ( @xmath3 ) , the position angle ( pa , @xmath4 ) computed from the isophotal distribution in the @xmath0-band by sdss along with the equivalent from first , the major ( @xmath5 ) and minor ( @xmath6 ) axes measured by sdss and first , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 measured from the petrosian intensity profile model fitted to the sdss images ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also use the concentration @xmath9 to help distinguish elliptical galaxies from the others ; for small @xmath10 the light distribution has an exponential profile and fits the profile of a disk galaxy , whereas for large values of @xmath10 the profile is approximated by a de vaucouleurs profile which fits the light distribution of an elliptical galaxy .    for our investigation",
    "we require galaxies and radio sources for which there are reliable measures of the pas of extended emission . since it is difficult to compute the pa accurately for very faint galaxies and very round ones , we have excluded all galaxies with @xmath11 , @xmath12 in either sdss or first , and those with @xmath13 in first ( since first has a @xmath14 beam ) .",
    "this leaves a total of 14302 galaxies .",
    "we further split the sample based on photometric determined parameters .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the colour defined by @xmath15 can discriminate between different distributions in the bimodal @xmath16 vs. @xmath17 colour - colour diagram for an earlier sdss data release .",
    "the colour and concentration are known to be correlated ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a bimodality in the density of points in the colour - colour diagram for our sample , suggesting that there are indeed two populations , with the redder , more highly concentrated objects being the elliptical galaxies . in order to investigate this quantitatively",
    "we have performed a principal component analysis ( pca ) on the sample , initially with two variables @xmath15 and @xmath10 .",
    "the two components which are generated by this procedure are @xmath18 dividing at @xmath19 gives a near optimum separation of the two types of galaxy .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : hist_corr ] we show the distribution of @xmath20 split by principal component @xmath21 and by axial ratio @xmath22 .",
    "as expected the two types of galaxy behave differently .",
    "it is very evident that the blue , less concentrated galaxies ( @xmath23 ) , which broadly represent the disk - dominated , spiral population , have the optical and radio major axes correlated , whereas the red , highly concentrated galaxies ( @xmath24 ) , which are part of the elliptical population , have a correlation between the optical major and radio minor axes .",
    "the most statistically significant minor axis alignment is obtained for a sub - sample defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that we are dealing with relatively round galaxies .",
    "though the major axis alignment for the spiral galaxies is interesting in its own right , for the rest of this contribution we will concentrate our discussion on the early - type galaxies .",
    "an extensive discussion of the behaviour of both types of galaxy can be found in @xcite .",
    "the bias towards @xmath26 in the red objects with high concentrations is highly statistically significant . since in these predominantly elliptical galaxies",
    "the radio - emission is almost certainly powered by mass accretion on to a central disk / black hole system , the radio elongation we measure will be that of the overall spin axis of that system .",
    "our results confirm those reported by @xcite who saw a strong trend for the jet axes in ugc elliptical galaxies to be aligned with the optical minor axes .",
    "simulations done by @xcite for different galaxy geometries show that strong minor axis alignments are observable only for galaxies which are oblate spheroids .",
    "therefore our results imply that there is a bias for the spin axis of the central engine to be aligned with the minor axes of galaxies and also that these galaxies are predominantly oblate spheroids , something supported by the analysis of galaxy shapes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radio minor axis alignment is something one might expect to see if the galaxies were rotationally supported and the black hole accretion disk axes were aligned with the overall galaxy rotation axes .",
    "one should contrast what we see here in elliptical galaxies with that seen in seyfert galaxies where there is only a weak relationship between jet axis and the axis of the host galaxy disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have divided the sample further by the ratio of radio to optical flux density expressed as @xmath27 where r is the r magnitude and t is given by : @xmath28 what is most remarkable is that the strong @xmath26 bias in the elliptical galaxies is confined to the radio quieter subset of these objects as is clearly evident from fig.[fig : histsplit2 ] the division at @xmath29 produces sub - samples with a ratio in numbers of around 2:1 and was not chosen _ a priori _ to have any particular physical significance for the elliptical galaxy population",
    ". however , the division seems to have physical significance , indicating that there are two distinct types of object within the elliptical population exhibiting quite different behaviour .",
    "we speculate that the galaxy shape in the quieter objects is fixed by rotation and that jets emerge along the stellar rotation axis .",
    "we emphasize that the two radio populations we talk about here have nothing to do with the traditional fr1/fr2 radio morphological division that for an l@xmath30 galaxy occurs at around @xmath31 not @xmath29 .",
    "virtually all our galaxies are in the fr1 range .",
    "we find that amongst the radio quieter objects the radio emission is strongly aligned with the optical minor axes .",
    "this requires there to be negligible projection effects suggesting that the galaxies are oblate , and possibly rotationally supported , with the jet emerging along the rotation axis . amongst the radio louder objects there is no preferred radio - optical alignment , more akin to what we would expect if the host galaxies were triaxial and not rotationally supported .",
    "we suggest that this dichotomy in alignment behaviour is another manifestation of the primarily optical dichotomy which exists between giant ellipticals and normal ( and dwarf ) ellipticals ( see for example faber et al . , 1997 ; kormendy et al .",
    "the former galaxies have cores , are slowly rotating and triaxial , and generally have boxy isophotes , while the latter are coreless , are rapid rotators and oblate , and generally have disky isophotes . assuming our association of the two dichotomies is correct ,",
    "a surprising consequence is that the distinction in terms of mass between `` giant '' and `` normal '' elliptical galaxies for the subset with radio emission appears to be very modest . in fig.[fig : mass ] we show distributions of stellar masses for the two subsets .",
    "the radio quieter objects are indeed less massive but only by around a factor of two . given that the observed ratio of radio to stellar luminosity @xmath32 spans more than three orders of magnitude , it is instructive to think in terms of the efficiency with which the different types of galaxy produce radio emission for a given stellar mass . from this viewpoint the isotropic , rotationally supported galaxies are low efficiency radio emitters while the anisotropic , slow rotators , have relatively high radio efficiencies .",
    "getting the gas from stellar mass loss to where it can be accreted by the black hole is an obvious candidate that can affect the efficiency .",
    "alternatively , the black hole spin , which may relate to the formation history of the galaxy , could affect the efficiency with which accreted fuel is converted into radio emitting jets .",
    "we find a highly statistically significant tendency for the axis of the radio emission to align with the minor axis of the starlight in elliptical galaxies .",
    "surprisingly , this trend is confined to the less radio - luminous objects .",
    "we suggest that this result may be a new manifestation of the well known dichotomy in the optical properties of elliptical galaxies ; i.e. between those with cores and which are slow rotators and those without cores and which are rotationally supported ."
