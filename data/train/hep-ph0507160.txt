    "@xcite .      the qualitative origin of the characteristic final - state signature of @xmath0-induced events",
    "is intuitively explained and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ event ] .",
    "an indispensable tool for a quantitative investigation of the characteristic final - state signature and notably for actual experimental searches of @xmath0-induced events at hera is our monte - carlo generator package qcdins@xcite .",
    "the results of dedicated searches for instanton - induced events by the h1 and zeus collaborations  @xcite , based on our theoretical work , have been finalized meanwhile .",
    "the h1 analysis was based on @xmath70 pb@xmath71 , while zeus used @xmath72 pb@xmath71 , with somewhat differing kinematical cuts . since the upgraded hera ii machine is now performing very well , forthcoming searches based on a several times higher luminosity might turn out most interesting .",
    "let me briefly summarize the present status from a theorist s perspective .",
    "while h1 indeed observed a statistically significant excess of events with instanton - like topology and in good agreement with the theoretical predictions , _ physical _ significance could not be claimed , due to remaining uncertainties in the standard dis ( sdis ) background simulation .",
    "the zeus collaboration obtained a conservative , background - independent upper limit on the instanton - induced hera cross section of @xmath73 , to be compared to our theoretical prediction of 8.9 pb for the given cuts . in both experiments",
    "it was demonstrated that a decisive experimental test of the theoretical predictions based on i - perturbation theory is well within reach in the near - future . in view of the present situation and the interesting prospects for hera",
    "ii , let me proceed with a number of comments .",
    "a first important task consists in reconstructing the instanton - subprocess variables ( @xmath74 ) from eq .",
    "( [ bjlim ] ) and in implementing the theoretically required fiducial cuts ( cf .",
    "( [ fiducial ] ) ) .",
    "the actual status is displayed in table  [ cuts ] for comparison .",
    ".[cuts ] comparison of implemented fiducial cuts that are required in principle to warrant the validity of i - perturbation theory . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the implications of the lacking @xmath75-cut both in the h1 and zeus data are presumably not too serious , since qcdins _with _ its default @xmath75-cut models to some extent the sharp suppression of @xmath0-effects , apparent in the lattice data ( cf .",
    "[ lattice](right ) ) for @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "yet , this lacking , experimental cut introduces a substantial uncertainty in the predicted magnitude of the @xmath0-signal that hopefully may be eliminated soon .",
    "the lacking @xmath78-cut in the h1 data is potentially more serious . as a brief reminder@xcite",
    ", this cut assures in particular the dominance of `` planar '' handbag - type graphs in @xmath79 and all final - state observables .",
    "because of computational complications , the non - planar contributions are _ not _ implemented in the qcdins event generator , corresponding to unreliable qcdins results for small @xmath78 .",
    "the main remaining challenge resides in the fairly large sdis background uncertainties .",
    "the essential reason is that the existing monte carlo generators have been typically designed and tested for kinematical regions different from where the instanton signal is expected ! although the residual problematics is not primarily related to lacking statistics , the near - future availability of many more events will allow to strengthen the cuts and thus hopefully to increase the gap between signal and background . a common search strategy consists in producing i - enriched data samples by cutting on several discriminating observables , each one being sensitive to _ different _ basic instanton characteristics .",
    "an optimized set may be found according to the highest possible @xmath80 in terms of the sdis and instanton efficiencies , with @xmath81 .",
    "substantial enhancements of the instanton sensitivity were obtained , by means of various multivariate discrimination methods , involving only a single cut on a suitable discriminant variable . in case of zeus , cuts on the fisher discriminant have been used to obtain instanton - enhanced subsamples .",
    "let me summarize the results obtained so far in form of a theorist s `` unified plot '' of the h1 and zeus `` excess '' versus the @xmath0-separation power .",
    "any visible correlation of a rising _ experimental _ `` excess '' with the ( monte - carlo ) _ theoretical _ i - separation power in fig .",
    "[ excess ] would be an intriguing first signature for a signal .",
    "the behaviour seen from the end of the zeus range into the h1 domain , might indeed suggest some increase of the excess towards rising i - sparation power .",
    "the comparatively low @xmath0-separation power of the zeus data ( and thus perhaps also their _ negative _ excess ? ) is mainly due to the implementation of the fiducial cut in @xmath78 that is lacking in case of h1 .",
    "given our extended experience with instanton physics both theoretically and experimentally at desy , it is natural to ask about the discovery potential for instanton - induced processes at the forthcoming lhc .",
    "indeed , a respective project has been set up around a theoretical phd thesis  @xcite , but is still in a relatively early stage .",
    "we attempt to do a broad study , focussing both on theoretical and phenomenological issues .",
    "let me just enumerate some interesting aspects that differ essentially from the familiar situation for spacelike hard scattering in dis at hera .",
    "_ theoretically _ : the first and foremost task is to identify and calculate the leading @xmath0-subprocess at the lhc within @xmath0-perturbation theory . unlike hera ( fig .",
    "[ opt - th](left ) ) , one starts from a @xmath82-initial state at the lhc .",
    "hence , the rate will be enhanced by a factor @xmath83 compared to @xmath84 scattering at hera .",
    "then , the next crucial question is how to enforce some parton virtuality in the respective instanton - induced @xmath82-subprocess , such as to retain the applicability of @xmath0-perturbation theory .",
    "an interesting possibility we are exploring is to enter the required virtuality through the _ final state _ in case of the lhc ! one may consider the fragmentation of one or even two outgoing quarks from the @xmath82-initiated @xmath0-instanton subprocess into a _",
    "@xmath85 photon or @xmath86-boson and other particles .",
    "the requirement of large @xmath85 then enforces a _ timelike _ virtuality onto the outgoing parent quark .",
    "_ experimentally _ : crucial criteria will be a good signature paired with the lowest possible background , as well as a good trigger . at the experimental front we forsee the collaboration of t. carli / cern , who will be able to merge his actual knowledge of the lhc with many years of experience from searches for instantons at hera .",
    "after the theoretical calculations are under control , the next task is to adapt our qcdins event generator to the lhc , to work out characteristic event signatures , optimal observables , fiducial cuts etc .",
    "one of the most important observations from hera is the strong rise of the gluon distribution at small bjorken-@xmath1  @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "this rise is predicted by the dglap evolution equations  @xcite at high @xmath78 and thus supports qcd  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", an undamped rise will eventually violate unitarity .",
    "the reason for the latter problem is known to be buried in the linear nature of the dglap- and the bfkl - equations  @xcite : for decreasing bjorken-@xmath1 , the number of partons in the proton rises , while their effective size @xmath87 increases with decreasing @xmath78 . at some characteristic scale @xmath88 , the gluons in the proton start to overlap and so the linear approximation is no longer applicable ; non - linear corrections to the linear evolution equations  @xcite arise and become significant , potentially taming the growth of the gluon distribution towards a `` saturating '' behaviour .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", @xmath28-scattering at small bjorken-@xmath1 and decreasing @xmath78 uncovers a novel regime of qcd , where the coupling @xmath89 is ( still ) small , but the parton densities are so large that conventional perturbation theory ceases to be applicable , eventually .",
    "much interest has recently been generated through association of the saturation phenomenon with a multiparticle quantum state of high occupation numbers , the `` colour glass condensate '' that correspondingly , can be viewed  @xcite as a strong _ classical _ colour field @xmath90 .",
    "being extended non - perturbative fluctuations of the gluon field , instantons come to mind naturally in the context of saturation , since    * classical _ non - perturbative _ colour fields are physically appropriate in this regime ; @xmath0-interactions always involve many non - perturbative gluons with multiplicity @xmath91 ! * the functional form of the instanton gauge field",
    "is explicitely known and its strength is @xmath92 as needed ; * an identification of the `` colour glass condensate '' with the qcd - sphaleron state appears very suggestive  @xcite ( cf . below and",
    "sec  4.4 ) .",
    "* at high energies ( @xmath93 ) , larger @xmath0-sizes ( @xmath94 fm ) are probed ! unlike dis , now the sharply defined average @xmath0-size @xmath95 fm ( known from lattice simulations  @xcite ) comes into play and becomes a relevant and conspicuous length scale in this regime ( cf .",
    "[ lambda](left ) ) . *",
    "an intriguing observation is that the @xmath0-size scale @xmath96 coincides surprisingly well with the transverse resolution @xmath97 , where the small-@xmath1 rise of the structure function @xmath98 _ abruptly _ starts to _ increase _ with falling @xmath99 ! this striking feature(right ) ] is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lambda](right ) , with the power @xmath100 being defined via the ansatz @xmath101 at small @xmath1 .",
    "a suggestive interpretation is that instantons are getting resolved for @xmath102 .",
    "* we know already from @xmath0-perturbation theory that the instanton contribution tends to strongly increase towards the softer regime  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for the decreasing instanton suppression with increasing energy is known since a long time  @xcite : feeding increasing energy into the scattering process makes the picture shift from one of tunneling between adjacent vacua ( @xmath103 ) to that of the actual creation of the sphaleron - like , coherent multi - gluon configuration  @xcite on top of the potential barrier of height  @xcite @xmath104 .",
    "the investigation of saturation becomes most transparent in the familiar colour - dipole picture  @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ coldip](left ) ) , notably if analyzed in the so - called dipole frame  @xcite . in this frame , most of the energy is still carried by the hadron , but the virtual photon is sufficiently energetic , to dissociate before scattering into a @xmath105-pair ( a _ colour dipole _ ) , which then scatters off the hadron .",
    "since the latter is lorentz - contracted , the dipole sees it as a colour source of transverse extent , living ( essentially ) on the light cone .",
    "this colour field is created by the constituents of the well developed hadron wave function and  in view of its high intensity , i.e. large occupation numbers  can be considered as classical .",
    "its strength near saturation is @xmath106 . at high energies",
    ", the lifetime of the @xmath107-dipole is much larger than the interaction time between this @xmath107-pair and the hadron and hence , at small @xmath108 , this gives rise to the familiar factorized expression of the inclusive photon - proton cross sections , @xmath109 here , @xmath110 denotes the modulus squared of the ( light - cone ) wave function of the virtual photon , calculable in pqcd , and @xmath111 is the @xmath107-dipole - nucleon cross section .",
    "the variables in eq .",
    "( [ dipole - cross ] ) are the transverse @xmath112-size @xmath113 and the photon s longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath114 carried by the quark .",
    "the dipole cross section is expected to include in general the main non - perturbative contributions . for small @xmath115 ,",
    "one finds within pqcd  @xcite that @xmath116 vanishes with the area @xmath117 of the @xmath107-dipole . besides this phenomenon of `` colour transparency '' for small @xmath118 ,",
    "the dipole cross section is expected to saturate towards a constant , once the @xmath107-separation @xmath115 exceeds a certain saturation scale @xmath119 ( cf .",
    "[ coldip](right ) ) .",
    "while there is no direct proof of the saturation phenomenon , successful models incorporating saturation do exist  @xcite and describe the data efficiently .",
    "let us outline more precisely our underlying strategy :    * we start from the large @xmath78 regime and appropriate cuts such that @xmath0-perturbation theory is strictly valid .",
    "the corresponding , known results on @xmath0-induced dis processes  @xcite are then transformed into the colour - dipole picture . *",
    "the guiding question is : can background instantons of size @xmath120 give rise to a saturating , geometrical form for the dipole cross section , @xmath121 * with the crucial help of lattice results , the @xmath105-dipole size @xmath115 is next carefully increased towards hadronic dimensions .",
    "thanks to the lattice input , ir divergencies are removed and the original cuts are no longer necessary .",
    "let us briefly consider first the simplest @xmath0-induced process , @xmath123 , with one flavour and no final - state gluons .",
    "more details may be found in ref .",
    "already this simplest case illustrates transparently that in the presence of a background instanton , the dipole cross section indeed saturates with a saturation scale of the order of the average @xmath0-size @xmath96 .",

    "as non - perturbative , topological fluctuations of the gluon fields , _ instantons _ are a basic aspect of qcd .",
    "hence their experimental discovery through hard instanton - induced processes would be of fundamental significance .",
    "a first purpose of this overview was to present a summary of our systematic theoretical and phenomenological investigations of the discovery potential in dis at hera , based on a calculable rate of measurable range and a characteristic `` fireball''-like event signature . in a summary of the present status of experimental searches by h1 and zeus ,",
    "the typical remaining challenges were particularly emphasized . in view of the good performance of the upgraded hera ii machine , one may expect further possibly decisive instanton search results in the near future.the existing h1 and zeus results have demonstrated already that the required sensitivity according to our theoretical predictions is within reach . looking ahead , i have briefly discussed an ongoing project concerning a broad investigation of the discovery potential of instanton processes at the lhc . a final part of this review was devoted to our work on small-@xmath1 saturation from an instanton perspective . after summarizing the considerable motivation for the relevance of instantons in this regime , the emerging intuitive",
    ", geometrical picture was illustrated with the simplest example , where indeed , saturation does occur .",
    "the form of the dipole cross section depends on the relation of two competing areas : the area @xmath181 , subtended by the @xmath182-dipole , and the area @xmath183 associated with the average size , @xmath95 fm , of the background instanton . for @xmath184 , the dipole cross section is dominated by the dipole area , corresponding to color transparency. for @xmath185 it saturates towards a constant proportional to the background instanton area .",
    "correspondingly , the average @xmath0-size scale @xmath96 is associated with the saturation scale .",
    "a further central and intriguing result concerned the identification of the color glass condensate with the qcd - sphaleron state . throughout , the non - perturbative information from lattice simulations was instrumental .",
