    "how dust forms and evolves in primordial galaxies needs to be considered before we can understand the chemical and thermodynamical evolution of a metal - poor interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "dust grains absorb stellar light and reemit it in far infrared ( fir ) .",
    "indeed , the fir spectral range represents a unique opportunity to study the dust properties and distribution , and dedicated space missions are planned in these wavelength bands ( astro - f , sirtf , herschel , etc . ) .",
    "dust grains also drastically accelerate the formation rate of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath2 ) , expected to be the most abundant molecule in the ism .",
    "hydrogen molecules emit vibrational - rotational lines , thus cooling the gas .",
    "the cooling rate of a galaxy consequently depends strongly on the dust content and its effect on h@xmath2 abundance .",
    "the production of dust is expected at the final stages of stellar evolution , and type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are the dominant source for the production of dust grains in young star - forming galaxies .",
    "the formation in stellar winds from evolved low - mass stars can also contribute considerably , but the cosmic time is not long enough for such stars to evolve at high redshift ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , dust is also destroyed by sn shocks ( jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) .",
    "the detailed modelling of dust evolution in star - forming regions therefore requires an accurate treatment of both types of processes .",
    "here we have developed a model for the evolution of dust content in primordial galaxies . to compare our model with observations , we need age information and the fir energy distribution . for high-@xmath4 primordial galaxies , present experiments can not determine these quantities accurately enough . nevertheless , because of their low metallicity and active star formation , blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) may be viable candidates for nearby primeval systems .",
    "we have focused on the evolution of dust content in one of these , sbs 0335 - 052 , since this object may be experiencing its first burst of star formation ( @xmath5 yr ; vanzi et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we first model the dust content of a young galaxy whose age is less than @xmath6 yr (   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "then , we compare the model predictions with the observed quantities of the extremely low - metallicity bcd , sbs  0335 - 052 (   [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "finally , we comment on implications for damped ly@xmath3 systems ( dlas ) .",
    "we aim at modelling the evolution of dust content in a young galaxy whose age is less than @xmath6 yr .",
    "we focus on the comparison with the extremely metal - poor ( 1/40 @xmath7 ) bcd sbs 0335 - 052 , one of the few possible local counterparts of a primordial galaxy in the nearby universe ( vanzi et al .",
    "because of its young age , the contribution of winds from late - type stars to dust formation is assumed to be negligible .",
    "we consider the dominant ( brightest ) star - forming complex , and assume that grains produced by sne ii are accumulated within this region .",
    "this assumption is consistent with high - resolution infrared imaging observations which reveal that the distribution of dust is as compact as the size of the star - forming region ( dale et al .",
    "2001 ; hunt , vanzi , & thuan 2001 ) .",
    "we start by considering a generic star - forming region in a galaxy .",
    "our model is applicable to young ( @xmath8 yr ) bursts . because of its young age",
    ", the contribution of type ia supernovae to the total supernova rate is neglected .",
    "the rate of sne ii is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) at @xmath11 ( we define @xmath12 at the beginning of the star formation ) , @xmath13 is the initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath14 is the lifetime of a star whose mass is @xmath15 , and we assumed that stars with @xmath16 produce sne ii . in this letter , we assume a constant sfr , @xmath17 , and a salpeter imf ( @xmath18 ; the mass range of stars is 0.160 @xmath19 ) to obtain a first estimate .",
    "our assumption of constant star formation is applicable if the time from the starburst is small .",
    "indeed , the difference between the instantaneous burst and the constant star formation history is small on small timescales ( @xmath0 yr , the age of sbs 0335 - 052 ; vanzi et al .",
    ".    in general , dust destruction by sne can be important , but for sbs 0335 - 052 it is negligible for the following reason .",
    "the destruction timescale @xmath20 is estimated to be ( mckee 1989 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total gas mass in a star - forming region , @xmath23 ( lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) is the mass accelerated to 100 km s@xmath24 by a sn blast , @xmath25 is the sn ii rate , @xmath26 ( mckee 1989 ) is the efficiency of dust destruction in a medium shocked by a sn .",
    "we assume the relation between stellar mass and lifetime as shown in inoue , hirashita , & kamaya ( 2000a ) . the sn ii rate increases with time , and reaches a constant value , if the star formation rate is constant in time .",
    "numerically , we find that @xmath27 around the age of 5 myr .",
    "we also assume that the star formation efficiency is the order of 5% as known empirically from observations ( e.g. , inoue , hirashita , & kamaya 2000b ) .",
    "this means that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the possible duration of the star - forming activity .",
    "thus , we finally find that @xmath30 .",
    "it is probable that @xmath31 during the ongoing starburst , and we can safely conclude that the dust destruction can be neglected .    therefore , the only contribution to total dust mass in the galaxy ( @xmath32 ) comes from the supply from sne ii",
    ". then the rate of increase of @xmath32 is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the typical dust mass produced in a sn ii .",
    "todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) showed that @xmath34 varies with progenitor mass and metallicity .",
    "there is also some uncertainty in the explosion energy of sne ii .",

    "we adopt the average of the four cases , i.e. , @xmath39 , but the calculated dust mass is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , there is uncertainty in @xmath34 and @xmath32 by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "since we are considering the first burst of star formation , we assume @xmath41 at @xmath12 . because dust production rate is proportional to @xmath25 which is proportional to the star formation rate @xmath42 , @xmath32 calculated by our model directly scales as @xmath42 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dust_ev ] , we show the dust mass evolution for a star formation rate of @xmath43 , a typical value for sbs 0335 - 052 ( hunt et al .",
    "2001 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dust_ev ] , we also show the values of dust masses derived by dale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hunt et al .",
    "the dust mass in hunt et al .",

    "[ fig : dust_ev],width=302 ]      probably the most direct way to measure dust content is to observe its fir emission .",
    "we now derive the evolution of fir luminosity and dust temperature . because of the large cross section of dust against ultraviolet ( uv ) light and the intense uv radiation field in a star - forming galaxy",
    ", we can assume that the fir luminosity is equal to the absorbed energy of ob stellar radiation ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "first , we estimate the optical depth for the uv radiation as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the grain radius ( spherical grains are assumed ) , @xmath47 is the typical absorption cross section for uv light , @xmath48 is the number density of grains , @xmath49 is the radius of the star - forming region ( a spherical star - forming region is assumed ) , and @xmath50 is the grain material density . we adopt @xmath51 m ( todini & ferrara 2001 ) , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 g @xmath54 ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "then we obtain the energy absorbed by dust .",
    "we assume that all the absorbed energy is reemitted in the fir .",

    "2000a ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fir_luminosity ] , we show the evolution of fir luminosity for @xmath59 , 100 , and 30 pc ( solid , dotted , and dashed lines , respectively ) .",

    "( 2001 ) have estimated that @xmath60 pc for sbs 0335 - 052 .",
    "we reexamine this finding to check the consistency with the dust supply rate from sne ii .",
    "the observed fir luminosity ( @xmath61 ) for sbs 0335 - 052 is reached in 8 , 3 , and 1.2 myr for @xmath59 , 100 , and 30 pc , respectively .    .",
    "the radius of the galaxy is assumed to be 300 , 100 , and 30 pc ( _ solid _ , _ dotted _ , and _ dashed _ lines , respectively ) the observed fir luminosity is shown by the horizontal dot - dashed line ( @xmath61 ; dale et al .",
    "[ fig : fir_luminosity],width=302 ]    the dust temperature @xmath62 is determined from the emissivity given by draine & lee ( 1984 ) ; i.e. , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the absorption efficiency ( the definition is the same as draine & lee ) as a function of wavelength @xmath65 .",
    "then , we finally obtain the following relation : @xmath66 in figure [ fig : t_dust ] , we show the evolution of dust temperature . the predicted temperature ( @xmath67120 k ) is higher than that observed in normal spiral galaxies ( @xmath68 k ) , but such a high temperature ( @xmath69 k ; dot - dashed line ; dale et al .",
    "2001 ) is observed in sbs 0335 - 052 .",
    "however , the observed fir luminosity and temperature are uncertain because the peak of fir spectrum has not been detected yet .",
    "thus , the three quantities ( the size , fir luminosity , and dust temperature ) are simultaneously accounted for by our model .",
    "such a high - dust temperature is also predicted for high-@xmath4 objects ( e.g. , totani & takeuchi 2001 ) .    .",
    "the radius of the star - forming region is assumed to be 300 , 100 , and 30 pc ( _ solid _ , _ dotted _ , and _ dashed _ lines , respectively ) .",
    "the observed dust temperature is shown by the horizontal dot - dashed line ( 80 k ; dale et al .",
    "2001).[fig : t_dust],width=302 ]      the abundance of 2 affects the cooling rate of gas . in particular , to obtain insight into the molecular cooling of a primordial system",
    ", nearby star - forming dwarf galaxies constitute an important `` laboratory '' .",
    "thus , we next calculate the evolution of molecular hydrogen fraction .",
    "we assume that molecules form on dust grains and are destroyed ( dissociated ) by the uv field ( both processes occur on a much shorter timescale than the lifetime of ob stars ; kamaya & hirashita 2001 ) .",
    "thus , we evaluate the two rates and assume equilibrium . we adopt the formation rate of h@xmath2 by hollenbach & mckee ( 1979 ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath72 is the number fraction in molecules ( i.e. , @xmath73 is the number density of 2 ) , @xmath74 is the mean thermal speed of hydrogen , and @xmath75 is the sticking coefficient of hydrogen atoms .",
    "the latter is given by ( omukai 2000 ) @xmath76^{-1}\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & [ 1+\\exp(7.5\\times 10 ^ 2(1/75 - 1/t_{\\rm d}))]^{-1}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the gas temperature .",
    "we take @xmath78 @xmath79 m",
    "( todini & ferrara 2001 ) and @xmath80 k. the gas temperature is at present poorly constrained both by absorption line and 21-cm h i observations ; however it should represent a reasonable estimate for the temperature of the cold , h@xmath2-forming phase of the galaxy ism .",
    "on the other hand , the dissociation rate @xmath81 is estimated empirically by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the uv radiation field attenuated by dust .",
    "we have assumed for normalization that the uv radiation intensity and dissociation rate at the solar neighbourhood are @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( jura 1974 ) , respectively , and that @xmath81 linearly scales with @xmath86 . equating the two rates ,",
    "we obtain @xmath72 as a function of age of burst . for a given amount of dust ,",
    "@xmath72 is independent of the hydrogen number density .",
    "thus , we examine the dependence on @xmath49 . since we assume that @xmath41 at @xmath12 and consider only the reaction on grains , the initial molecular fraction is assumed to be zero ( @xmath87 at @xmath12 ) .",
    "if h@xmath2 formation in the gas phase is allowed , @xmath88 at @xmath12 . in this sense ,",
    "our estimate of @xmath72 is a lower limit .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : h2 ] for @xmath59 , 100 , and 30 pc ( solid , dotted , and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "the molecular fraction rises because of the shielding of uv radiation by grains .",
    "thus , the dust enrichment by sne ii causes a significant shielding of uv radiation field . once the column density of h@xmath2 becomes larger than @xmath89 @xmath90 , the self - shielding effect becomes important ( e.g. , draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "the value corresponds to @xmath91 .",

    "the radius of the star - forming region is assumed to be 300 , 100 , and 30 pc ( _ solid _ , _ dotted _ , and _ dashed _ lines , respectively ) .",
    "[ fig : h2],width=302 ]",
    "for the dust mass , dale et al .",

    "hunt et al .",

    "a starburst of age @xmath96@xmath97 yr reproduces those values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dust_ev ] ) .",
    "this range is consistent with the age observationally determined by vanzi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for the dust temperature , it is necessary that the radius of the star - forming region be smaller than 100 pc to explain the 80 k component revealed by _ iso _",

    "near - infrared emission lines are available .",
    "the line intensity is dependent on the excitation mechanism and thus the quantity of h@xmath2 is poorly constrained .",

    "finally , we conclude that if the star forming region of sbs 0335 - 052 is compact ( @xmath98 pc ) and the gas density is large ( @xmath99 @xmath54 ) , the young age , the dust amount , the fir luminosity , dust temperature , and the 2 abundance are mutually consistent and explained by our models .",
    "the main conclusion drawn in this letter is that star formation activity in extremely metal - poor systems can suffer from extinction .",

    "they suggested that the small dust number density ( as low as 10@xmath100 times the galactic value ) can account for the observed small molecular fraction ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we have shown that such a low molecular fraction can be due to the dissociation caused by recently formed ob stars .",
    "we also have suggested that if the region is compact and dense , the dust produced by sne ii can shield the uv radiation .",
    "this can produce a strong correlation between dust amount and 2 fraction .",

    "some dlas whose depletion is large show molecular fractions up to 0.2 ( ge , bechtold , & kulkarni 2001 ) .",
