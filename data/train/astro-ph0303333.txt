    "boyle et al . ( 2000 ; the 2df survey ) have shown that this increase can be described in terms of pure luminosity evolution , i.e. the shape of the luminosity function does not change with @xmath9 , up to at least @xmath14 . at higher redshifts evidence for a decrease in space density , consistent with pure luminosity evolution ,",

    "( 2000 ) at @xmath21 .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2001b ) also found substantial deviations from pure luminosity evolution : the bright end of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath22 appears to be flatter than found at lower redshifts , i.e. the decrease in space density with increasing redshift depends on luminosity .",
    "radio - loud quasars are a small subset of the quasar population , but as stressed by several authors ( e.g. peacock 1985 ; dunlop & peacock 1990 ; shaver et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) , selection in the radio drastically reduces contamination by foreground stars with optical colors similar to high - redshift quasars , and is unaffected by both intrinsic and extrinsic dust obscuration and reddening .",
    "thus the high - redshift behaviour of the radio - loud quasar luminosity function is a robust probe of the abundance of massive objects at very early cosmological epochs .",
    "a second important motivation for radio searches of high-@xmath9 quasars is understanding the origin of the radio phenomenon .",
    "differences , if any , in the early evolutionary behaviour of radio and optical activity would provide valuable clues .",
    "several searches for high - redshift radio - loud quasars have been carried out ( e.g. : shaver et al .",

    "hook et al .",
    "( 1998b ) reported indications that the peak in the quasar space density may have occured at earlier cosmological epochs for more radio - luminous sources , the decline in space density with redshift being less pronounced for these radio sources .",
    "jarvis & rawlings ( 2000 ) analyzed the top decade in radio luminosity ( log @xmath26 , quasars and galaxies ) of sources from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample .",
    "they deduce a decline by a factor @xmath27 between @xmath24 and @xmath28 , less abrupt than envisaged by shaver et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1999 ) and consistent with that measured by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) for radio sources in general .",
    "jarvis et al . ( 2001 ) investigated the high - redshift evolution of the most - radio - luminous ( @xmath29 29.8 ) steep - spectrum radio sources using three samples selected at low frequencies ( 3crr , 6ce , and 6c@xmath30 ) .",
    "they found the data consistent with a constant space density between @xmath24 and @xmath31 and exclude a decline as steep as suggested by shaver et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "these results are not necessarily inconsistent , since different ranges of radio luminosity and different frequency selections were used .",
    "no evidence for a rapid decline of the space density of soft - x - ray selected quasars at @xmath32 was apparent in the rosat survey data analyzed by miyaji et al .",

    "in this paper we report the results of a search for @xmath16 radio - loud quasars , down to radio flux densities thirty times fainter than in previous searches , and with no selection on radio spectral index .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in sect .",
    "2 we describe the construction of our sample of @xmath9 = 4 quasars .    in sect .",
    "3 we calculate the space density at @xmath33 , and compare it with that at @xmath8 derived from a sample of quasars of similar optical and radio luminosity .    in sect .",
    "4 we calculate the @xmath16 space density of all quasars optically brighter than m@xmath0(1450 ) @xmath10 , using a new determination of the fraction of radio loud quasars at that redshift , and compare it with that measured at @xmath9 = 2 .",
    "section 5 contains the discussion , and sect .",
    "6 our conclusions .",
    "the broad - band optical color of quasars reddens dramatically with redshift , as the lyman-@xmath34 forest and the 912-  lyman - limit leave the blue band ( fig .",
    "1 ) . to obtain a sample of high - redshift quasars , we therefore sought optical identifications of first radio sources ( becker et al .",
    "1995 , white et al .",
    "1997 ) with objects catalogued by the automated plate measuring facility ( apm ; ( mcmahon & irwin 1992 ) as being star - like on the poss - i @xmath35 ( red ) plates , with red magnitude @xmath36 , and with measured color @xmath37 , or @xmath38 fainter than the plate limit ( @xmath38 @xmath39 ) .",
    "the first radio catalogue ( version of july 2000 ) includes @xmath13 660,000 radio sources with peak flux density s@xmath40 mjy in 2.24 sr and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , of which 2.138 sr are covered by the apm catalogue .",
    "we sought optical identifications lying closer than 15 to each radio position , corresponding to @xmath43 3 standard deviations in the expected combined radio and optical positional errors ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    searching to a larger radius would have netted 1% more identifications , but the contamination from foreground stars rises rapidly with search radius ( see again fig .",
    "2 ) . a similar search radius ( 12 )",
    "was used by white et al ( 2000 ) in their search for first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) candidates . our search yielded a starting list of 2323 candidates .",
    "trial spectroscopy showed that @xmath13 85% of these ` stellar ' candidates are faint galaxies .    in order to reduce contamination by these galaxies , we ran the sextractor program ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on images of the 2323 candidates on the poss - ii red plates , which have better sensitivity and spatial resolution than poss - i .",
    "eighty - two percent of the candidates ( 1901 objects ) were clearly extended ( i.e. galaxies ) .",
    "seventy - three candidates could not be found by sextractor , either because they were defects on the poss - i plate ( 62 objects ) or due to confusion effects near a bright star ( 11 objects ) .",
    "the remaining 349 candidates were sought in the minnesota aps catalogue of poss - i ( pennington et al . 1993 ) .",
    "fifty - five of the candidates , undetected by apm on the @xmath38 plate ( i.e. potentially very red ) , were detected by aps .",
    "these have @xmath44 3 , so were removed from the sample .",
    "this left 294 candidates , 194 of which we classified , on the basis of the sextractor - generated parameters , as ` star - like ' , and 100 as ` possibly star - like ' .",
    "ccd images of a third half of these were obtained in 13-seeing with the loiano 1.5-m telescope of the astronomical observatory of bologna . on these images , 25 of the 70 `",
    "star - like ' , and 28 of the 33 ` possibly star - like ' candidates were extended .",
    "we have not investigated further the 100 ` possibly star - like ' objects . as a result",
    "we expect an incompleteness of @xmath45 stellar candidates .",
    "spectra were obtained of 121 of the 194 candidates , using the ids spectrograph of the isaac newton telescope ( benn et al .",
    "2001 , holt et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "eighteen of the 121 ( 15% ) are quasars with @xmath46 .",
    "the fraction of high - redshift quasars varies little with the optical magnitude of the candidates , but depends strongly on radio flux density : @xmath47 for @xmath48 10 mjy and @xmath49 for @xmath50 mjy . amongst the 73 candidates",
    "not observed spectroscopically , there are 6 with @xmath51 10 mjy and 67 with @xmath52 mjy . on the basis of the above high - redshift - quasar fractions , and accounting",
    "also for the @xmath43 15 missed stellar candidates ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) , we expect to have missed a total of @xmath53 high redshift quasars , i.e. the search is @xmath54 complete or , equivalently , corresponds to an area on the sky of 1.432 sr",
    ".      our search for high - redshift quasars within this area will be incomplete for a number of other reasons , that we discuss below :    \\1 ) _ incompleteness of the apm catalogue_. according to mcmahon et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , apm classifies correctly 92% of @xmath55 objects on at least one of the @xmath38 or @xmath35 plates . assuming that the apm @xmath35 and @xmath38 plate misclassifications are independent and occur at a similar rate , then a 92%-correct classification on at least one plate implies 72%-correct classification on individual plates .",
    "this last figure is a lower limit on the incompleteness of our @xmath35 plate based star - like classification ( the classification on the @xmath38 and @xmath35 plate can not be completely independent ) .",
    "for an independent estimate of our incompleteness , we searched for apm detections of 100 @xmath56 4 quasars with @xmath57 from the list of djorgovski ( 2001 ) , which were originally found either on the poss - ii plates or in sdss ( ccd based ) .",
    "all 100 were detected by apm .",
    "eighteen of these quasars appeared extended in the apm @xmath35 band , i.e. the search was @xmath58 complete .    as a further check we searched the apm catalogue for counterparts of 4949 objects with",
    "@xmath59 catalogued as star - like in the aps .",
    "apm classifies as extended @xmath60 of these objects and misses a further @xmath61 , i.e. is 84% complete .",
    "because the aps classification algorithm ( neural network ) is believed to be more reliable than that of apm , we assume that disagreements about classification by apm and aps are due mainly to errors in the former .    to check the aps classification reliability , we constructed a sample of 190 quasars , 140 from the fbqs survey with @xmath62 and 50 from the b3vla qss survey ( vigotti et al .",
    "1997 ) with @xmath63 . only 10",
    "quasars were classified extended by aps , i.e. an incompleteness of 5% .",
    "this is three times smaller than the apm incompleteness , consistent with our assumption above .",
    "the above two estimates of apm completeness are in good agreement and we assume a value of @xmath64 ) % .",
    "in addition , a few star - like objects might have been misclassified extended when we analysed the images with sextractor , or at the stage of ccd imaging , but the number is likely to be very small .",
    "\\2 ) _ omission of quasars with extended radio emission_. optical counterparts were sought at the positions of individual first radio sources , but not at the mid - points of possible double sources . in the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) in the south galactic cap , becker et al .",
    "( 2001a ) also sought counterparts along the lines joining possible double sources of separation up to 30@xmath65 , and found that a search at the positions of individual radio components is 96% complete . at @xmath66 4 , the rest - frame frequency of observation",
    "is even higher than for fbqs , favouring more flat - spectrum compact sources .",
    "we therefore expect our sample to be more complete , and we assume a completeness of ( 98 @xmath6 1)% .",
    "\\3 ) _ incompleteness due to errors in the radio - optical positions_. the distribution of the radio - optical separations of the quasars ( fig .",
    "2 ) is consistent with a rms error of 05 , implying that our search out to radius 15 is @xmath67 complete .",
    "\\4 ) _ incompleteness due to color selection_. the fraction of @xmath56 3.8 quasars with @xmath68 3@xmath69 can be estimated approximately from the color distribution in fig .",
    "1a ( taken from the literature ) .",
    "81 of the 85 quasars with @xmath56 3.8 have @xmath68 3 , i.e. this color criterion finds ( @xmath70 % of quasars with z@xmath4 3.8 , but the efficiency falls rapidly with decreasing redshift .",
    "we therefore restrict our sample to @xmath71 .    combining the above ,",
    "the completeness of our search for @xmath56 3.8 quasars in first is @xmath72% over the effective area ( sect .",

    "this flux - density - dependent incompleteness is in addition to that discussed above .",
    "the 13 radio - loud quasars with @xmath77 , the @xmath78 sample , are listed in tab . 1 .",
    "the @xmath35 magnitudes were recalibrated using aps catalogue ( rms error 02 , better than apm , because the aps photometry was calibrated on a plate - by - plate basis ) and corrected for galactic extinction .",
