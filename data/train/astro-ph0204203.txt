    "the realization that grbs are beamed with rather narrow opening angles , while the following afterglow could be observed over a wider angular range , led immediately to the search for orphan afterglows : afterglows which are not associated with observed prompt grb emission .",
    "rhoads ( 1997 ) was the first to suggest that observations of orphan afterglows would enable us to estimate the opening angles and the true rate of grbs .",
    "an expanding jet with an opening angle @xmath4 , behaves , as long as its lorentz factor @xmath5 , as if it is a part of a spherical shell ( piran , 1994 ) .",
    "as it slows down and reaches @xmath6 the jet quickly expands laterally ( rhoads , 1999 ) producing a pronounced break in its light curve . as time progresses",
    "it can be observed over wider and wider observing angles , @xmath7 .",
    "dalal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have pointed out that as the post jet - break afterglow light curves decay quickly , most orphan afterglows will be dim and hence undetectable .",
    "they also suggest that the maximal observing angle , @xmath8 , of an orphan afterglow will be a constant factor times @xmath4 .",
    "hence the ratio of observed orphan afterglows , @xmath9 , to that of grbs , @xmath10 , will not tell us much about the opening angles of grbs and the true rate of grbs , @xmath11 .",
    "the observation that grbs have a constant amount of total energy ( piran et al , 2001 ; panaitescu and kumar 2001 ; frail et al . , 2001 ) and that the observed variability in the apparent luminosity arises mostly from variation in the jet opening angles leads to a remarkable result : the post jet - break afterglow light curve is universal ( granot et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "we calculate this universal post jet - break light curve , using both first principle considerations and a calibration from the observed afterglows of grb990510 ( harrison et al . , 1999 ;",

    "note that the evolution during this phase is independent of @xmath4 , whose only role is to determine the time of the jet break .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath18 do not vary from one burst to another then the light curve during this phase will be universal , depending only on the microscopic parameters ( the equipartition parameters , @xmath24 , and the power law index @xmath25 of the electrons distribution ) of the specific afterglow . during both phases the observed time is given by : @xmath26 equations [ jet ] and [ time ] yield that the jet break transition takes place at ( sari , piran & halpern , 1999 ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the value of the quantity @xmath29 in units of @xmath30 times its ( c.g.s ) units .",
    "due to relativistic beaming , an observer located at @xmath7 outside the initial opening angle of the jet ( @xmath31 ) will ( practically ) observe the afterglow emission only at @xmath32 when @xmath33 : @xmath34 roughly at @xmath32 the emission is also maximal . from then on",

    "the rate of observed orphan afterglows ( over the entire sky ) is ( in model a ) : @xmath105 where n(z ) is the rate of grbs per unit volume and unit proper time and dv(z ) is the differential volume element at redshift @xmath12 .",

    "again the results for model b are similar ( as long as @xmath137 ) .",
    "as the sky coverage of grb detectors is not continuously @xmath138 it is possible that a grb pointing towards us ( i.e. with @xmath139 will be missed , but its on - axis afterglow will be detected . in table",

    "as expected this ratio is large for small jet opening angles and for large limiting magnitudes ( and models a and b give similar results in this limit ) and it decreases with increasing @xmath4 and decreasing @xmath140 .",
    "an insensitive search ( @xmath3 ) yields for model a , a comparable ( or even larger ) probability that a visual transient is a missed on - axis grb whose afterglow is detected or an orphan one .",
    "however , for model b , this ratio is less sensitive to either @xmath4 or @xmath140 for @xmath141 , and even for @xmath3 the majority of the afterglows would be orphans .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ ntot ] depicts the number of orphan afterglows per square degree ( and in the entire sky ) , in a single exposure , as a function of the limiting magnitude .",

    "canonical \" normalization ( @xmath144 , @xmath114 and @xmath68 ) model b predicts 2.5 times more orphan afterglows than model a , for a limiting magnitude of 23 .",
    "these numbers provide an upper limit to the rate in which orphan afterglows will be recorded as point - like optical transients in any exposure with a given limiting magnitude .",
    "these numbers should be considered as upper limits , as our estimates do not include effects such as dust extinction that could make these transients undetectable .",
    "we ask now what will be the optimal strategy for a given observational facility : short and shallow exposures that cover a larger solid angle or long and deep ones over a smaller area .",
    "the exposure time that is required in order to reach a given limiting flux , @xmath118 , is proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "we can now divide the number density of observed orphan afterglows ( shown in figure [ ntot ] ) by this time factor and obtain the rate per square degree per hour of observational facility .",
    "figure [ deepvsshal ] depicts this rate with a calibration to a hypothetical 2 m class telescope that reaches a 25th magnitude with one hour exposure .",
    "other telescopes will have another normalization but the trend seen in this figure remains .",
    "figure [ deepvsshal ] shows that shallow surveys that cover a large area are preferred over deep ones ( in both models ) .",
    "this result can be understood as follows . multiplying eq .",
    "[ rate2_an ] by @xmath146 shows that the rate per square degree per hour of observational facility @xmath147 . as @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) a shallow survey is preferred .",
    "a practical advantage of this strategy is that it would be easier to carry out follow up observations with a large telescope on a brighter transient detected in a shallow survey .",
    "additionally one can expect that the number of spurious transients will be smaller in a shallower survey .",
    "however , if one wishes to detect orphan afterglows , one should still keep the surveys at a limiting magnitude of @xmath150 , as for smaller magnitudes the number of on - axis transients detected will be comparable to ( model b ) or even larger than ( model a ) the number of orphan afterglows ( see table i ) .    the number density of orphan afterglow transients , given by eq .",
    "[ rate2 ] and depicted in figure [ ntot ] gives an indication of the number of single events recorded above a limiting magnitude .",
    "clearly , a single detection is not enough in order to identify that the transient indeed corresponded to an afterglow .",
    "a second following detection of the transient with a decrease by , say , 1 magnitude , would increase the probability that the transient is an orphan afterglow .",
    "we estimate the rate of a double detection of this nature by an afterglow search with a limiting magnitude @xmath140 and a time delay @xmath151 between the two exposures of the same region in the sky .",
    "we consider , therefore , a detection of a transient in one exposure and a second detection after time @xmath151 in which the transient has decayed by more than one magnitude but is still above the limiting magnitude of the survey .",
    "this is of course an idealized situation and we do not consider realistic observational problems ( like weather etc . ) which may make the detection rate lower .",
    "not surprisingly , the ratio of a double detection to a single detection depends on the time delay , @xmath151 ( see figure [ timedelay ] ) .",
    "the optimal time delay is the time in which an afterglow from @xmath128 and with @xmath140 decays by one magnitude : @xmath152 days for @xmath3 , @xmath153 days for @xmath0 and @xmath154 days for @xmath155 . with this optimal choice ,",
    "the fraction of the detected transients that will be detected in a second exposure , is 20% for @xmath155 and 12% for @xmath3 .",
    "note however , that the curve becomes narrower for low limiting magnitudes , making the exact timing of the second exposure more critical .",
    "deeper surveys are less sensitive to the choice of the time delay .",
    "it is interesting to compare the rate of observed orphan afterglows to the true grb rate as a function of the beaming factor , @xmath156 . at this point models a and b differ the most . for model",
    "b this ratio is @xmath157 and for the  canonical \" parameters it holds the values of @xmath158 for @xmath159 independently of @xmath160 . in model",
    "a this ratio vanishes for low @xmath160 values . for high @xmath160 values",
    "the ratio converges to model s b constant ratio .",
    "for the  canonical \" parameters this ratio in model a reaches half of the asymptotic value for @xmath161 for @xmath162 respectively .",
    "thus , for strong beaming ( or high @xmath140 ) it is possible to estimate the true grb rate from a determination of the orphan afterglow rate . for a low beaming factor",
    "this ratio is model dependent .",
    "we have calculated the number per unit solid angle of orphan afterglows that could be detected by idealized surveys with different limiting magnitudes .",
    "our calculations are based on a simple idealized model for the hydrodynamics of the sideways expanding jets .",
    "light curves from other models , including numerical simulations ( granot et al . , 2001 ) described in granot et al . , ( 2002 ) show similar behavior . as the models differ when @xmath101 we also consider an alternative assumption for this range .",
    "this yields analytic expressions for @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( equations [ rate1_an ] and [ rate2_an ] ) .",
    "we have shown that both models yield similar results for surveys deeper than @xmath0 and have minor differences for surveys with @xmath165 .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath51 , of this light curve ( equation [ fnumax2a ] ) is somewhat sensitive to the choice of the model parameters .",
    "even observed afterglows with a clear jet break do not yield a well defined normalization factor , @xmath166 , because of the uncertainties in @xmath4 , @xmath35 , and @xmath167 .",
    "as @xmath168 ( equation [ rate2_an ] ) , we expect the uncertainty in @xmath164 to be similar to that in @xmath51 ( a factor @xmath82 ) .",
    "however , this uncertainty does not influence the trends that indicate a strategy for optimal orphan afterglow survey .",
    "we stress that we do not consider here practical observational issues , such as dust extinction or the ability to identify a weak transient on top of a background host galaxy .",
    "we have also assumed idealized weather conditions : when considering a  verified \" identification by two successive detections we assumed that a second exposure is always possible .",
    "all these factors will reduce the observed rate by some unknown factors below our optimistic values .",
    "we do not consider how recorded transients could be identified as afterglows . for example when we discuss a single detection we mean a single photometric record of a transient in a single snapshot .",
    "this is of course a very weak requirement and much more ( at least a second detection ) would be needed to identify this event as an afterglow .",
    "finally one should be aware of the possible confusion between orphan afterglows and other transients .",
    "most transients could be completely unrelated ( such as supernovae or agns ) and could be distinguished from afterglows with followup observations",
    ". however , there could be a class of related transients like on - axis jets whose gamma - ray emission was nt observed due to lack of coverage or failed grbs ( huang et al .",
    "the only quantitative measure that we provide is for the ratio of on - axis afterglows to truly orphan ones ( i.e. off - axis afterglows whose prompt gamma - ray emission would have been detectable if viewed from within the jet opening angle ) .",
    "we have shown that for a given dedicated facility the optimal survey strategy will be to perform many shallow snapshots . however , those should not be too shallow as we will observe more on - axis afterglows than off - axis ones .",
    "a reasonable limiting magnitudes will be @xmath169 . with this magnitude we should perform a repeated snapshot of the same region after 3 to 4 days .",
    "we consider now several possible surveys .",
    "the sdss ( york , 2000 ) has @xmath170 over @xmath171 square degrees in the north galactic cap .",
    "figure [ ntot ] suggests that under the most optimistic condition we expect 15 detection of orphan afterglow transients in the north galactic cap of the sdss .",
    "a careful comparison of the sdss sky coverage and the exposure of relevant grb satellites could reveal the rate of coincident detection ( grb - sloan optical transient ) from which one could get a better handle ( using table i ) on the possible rate of detection of orphan afterglows by sdss . under the more realistic assumptions we expect a single orphan afterglow transient in the sdss .",
    "note that the 5 filters sdss system could possibly select orphan afterglow candidates even with only a single detection ( rhoads 2001 ; vanden berk et.al , 2001 ) , though this method could be applied only to bright sources .",
    "as the north galactic cap survey provides only a single snapshot with no spectral information at magnitude of 23 , even if a transient will be recorded in this survey it will be impossible to identify it as a transient .",
    "clearly this is not the best survey for orphan afterglows search .",
    "however , the south galactic cap survey , observes the same part of the sky repeatedly with @xmath172 .",
    "it can achieve a higher magnitude , 25th , for steady sources .",
    "if the repetition interval is longer than 2 weeks , than for most orphan afterglows , the second observations can be considered as a new one . therefore , given that the time spent in the south cap is comparable to the time spent in the north cup , the detection rate should be comparable . the advantage of the south cap is the ability to identify transients sources even if the decay process could not be observed , and the possibility of ruling out sources that are not transient in nature , such as agns .",
    "consider now a dedicated 2 m class telescope with an aperture @xmath173 of @xmath174 for a 10 minutes exposure and @xmath0 for a 1 hour exposure . under our most optimistic assumptions",
    "it will record up to 35 orphan afterglows per year in the shallow mode and a third of that ( 13 afterglows ) in the deeper mode .",
    "using our  canonical \" model we find two orphan afterglows per year in the shallow mode .",
    "the vimos camera at the vlt has a comparable aperture of @xmath175 but it can reach @xmath176 in 10 minutes and @xmath155 in an hour . a single @xmath155 frame would have a @xmath177 orphan afterglows under the most optimistic assumptions ( @xmath178 canonically ) .",
    "thus , at best 2 - 3 orphan afterglows should be hiding in every 1000 exposures .",
    "the subaru / suprime - cum has a similar sensitivity but its field of view is four times larger .",
    "therefore every 1000 exposures should contain no more than 10 orphan afterglows.it will be however a remarkable challenge to pick up these transients and confirm their nature from all other data gathered in these 1000 exposures .",
