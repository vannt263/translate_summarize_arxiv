    "supernovae ( sne ) come in two basic models : exploding white dwarfs that are members of close binary systems , and single massive stars that develop iron cores .",
    "type ia sne are generally regarded to be exploding carbon - oxygen white dwarf stars that have reached the chandrasekhar limit due to mass transfer from a nearby non - degenerate donor star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". therefore , type ia sne are explosions constrained by a uniform energy budget .",
    "this leads to a high degree of uniformity of their light curves . the objects with more rapidly declining light curves are fainter at maximum light , and the slow decliners are brighter @xcite . in the near - infrared ,",
    "however , type ia sne are even better .",
    "they are standard candles @xcite . except for the fastest declining objects ,",
    "there are essentially no `` decline rate relations '' in the ir .    as we have shown in a recent series of papers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , a combination of optical and near - ir photometry allows the accurate determination of host galaxy extinction of type ia sne , even if the dust is different than `` standard '' galactic dust with r@xmath1 = 3.1 .",
    "type ii sne are thought to be single stars born with 8 m@xmath2 or more which , after a few million years of evolution , undergo the collapse of their iron cores and the subsequent ejection of their hydrogen - rich envelopes @xcite .",
    "observationally , type ii - p sne are distinguished by prominent hydrogen lines in their spectra .",
    "when the star explodes with a significant fraction of its h - rich envelope , in theory it should display a light curve characterized by a phase of @xmath3 100 days of nearly constant luminosity followed by a sudden drop of 2 - 3 mag @xcite .",
    "more than half of all type ii sne belong to this class of `` plateau '' sne whose progenitors are attributed to stars born with less than 25 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "type ii - p sne show a wide mass range , a considerable spread in explosive power , absolute magnitudes , and ejecta velocities @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that there is a correlation between the expansion velocities of type ii - p sne and their bolometric luminosities during the plateau phase .",
    "thus , type ii - p sne can be useful as standardizable candles in their own right .    in this paper",
    "we address a simple question",
    ". can type ii - p sne be found that exhibit similar enough color curves such that we may attribute the systematic differences of their colors to different amounts of dust extinction along the light of sight ? if the answer to this question is yes , then in principle photometry can be used to obtain absolute magnitudes of type ii - p sne which have minimal systematic errors owing to dust extinction along the line of sight .",
    "accurate distances give us accurate luminosities , which are critical for constraining hydrodynamic models of type ii - p sne as well as for cosmological studies .",
    "sn  1999em was discovered on 1999 october 29.44 by @xcite in the face - on spiral ngc 1637 . a spectrum taken on october 30.34 ut by @xcite revealed it to be a type ii supernova at an early epoch .",

    "a large fraction of the data of the two sne discussed in this paper was obtained with the dual optical - infrared photometer andicam .",
    "this instrument was mounted at the cassegrain focus of the yale - aura - lisbon - ohio ( yalo ) 1.0-m telescope at ctio from 1999 through early 2003 .",
    "after that it has been used with the 1.3-m ex-2mass telescope at ctio .",
    "optical and near - ir light curves of sn  1999em were first presented graphically by @xcite and need not be reproduced here .",
    "the optical photometry of sn  1999em will be published by @xcite as part of an extensive study of type ii - p sne .",
    "@xcite present independent photometry of this object .",
    "we note that the data of leonard et al . were obtained with the katzman automatic imaging telescope at lick observatory , _ not _ with any of the telescopes at ctio .",
    "the photometric colors of sn  1999em as measured with the various telescopes are in very good agreement .    revised analysis of sn  1999em using the `` expanding photosphere method '' ( epm ) yields an explosion time of jd 2,452,475 @xmath5 1 day @xcite .",
    "if all type ii - p sne could yield times of explosion with this accuracy , then these would be the most sensible reference times .",
    "@xcite uses the time that signals the end of the plateau .",
    "but it is known that the length of the plateau varies , as it depends on the mass of the ejected envelope . for our purposes here we shall adopt a `` reference time '' of julian date 2,451,483.7 (= 1999",

    "their derived explosion time is jd 2,452,857 @xmath5 4 days .",
    "the large uncertainty in the date of explosion is due to the lack of early - time spectra compared to sn  1999em .",
    "the method of @xcite relies on the end of the plateau phase as the reference time .",
    "this is not the best reference time to choose for our purposes here , as the plateau phase of sn  2003hn lasted 20 days less than that of sn  1999em .",
    "we choose to adopt a `` reference time '' for sn  2003hn which relies on a @xmath23 minimization of the color curves using the templates from sn  1999em for fitting .",
    "the most consistent results were obtained using the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 templates and adding 1386.78 @xmath5 0.45 days to the reference time adopted for sn  1999em .",

    "if two sne have identical spectra but suffer different amounts of total extinction along the line of sight , _ all _ color indices of one object should be redder than the corresponding color indices of the other object . in most color indices ( @xmath6[@xmath24 )",

    "the simplest explanation is that the spectrum of sn  1999em exhibits greater line blanketing due to a higher metallicity .",
