    "the empirical applicability of the markowitz mean variance portfolio selection paradigm suffers primarily due to estimation risk concerning model parameters ( cf .",
    "klein and bawa 1976 , best and grauer 1991 ) .",
    "different methods are suggested in order to repair the markowitz procedure such as shrinkage estimators ( golosnoy and okhrin 2009 , frahm and memmel 2010 ) or constraining portfolio weights ( jagannathan and ma , 2003 , behr et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "another recent popular approach is to impose an additional norm ( quadratic form ) constraint on the vector of portfolio weights ( brodie et al . , 2009 , fan et al . , 2012 ) , which is equivalent to adding a penalty component to the mean - variance objective function .",
    "the statistical background of such constraints is related to regularization techniques such as lasso and/or ridge regression , see tibshirani ( 1996 , 2011 ) for recent reviews . from the empirical point of view , imposing constraints on portfolio weights leads to robust portfolio compositions and , consequently , allows to achieve higher expected utility of terminal wealth . up to now , however , the idea of constraining norm of portfolio weights has not been motivated from economic or decision theoretical perspectives .    in this paper , we suggest that such penalties can be related to a behavioral desire for social learning among the group of investors .",
    "social learning behavior of an individual means that he wants to act like others ( cf .",
    "gilboa et al . , 2006 ) , i.e. to mimic portfolio decisions of other group members .",
    "it presumes that each investor is willing to choose portfolio weights by penalizing deviations of his portfolio composition from compositions of others",
    ". this could be rational for economic agents in situations where their own information signals are too noisy .",
    "in portfolio selection context it corresponds to the desire ` to follow the crowd ' where a decision maker wants to hold the same portfolio as the others regardless of his own information signals ( cf .",

    "( 2015 ) provide broad empirical evidence for various aspects of this phenomenon .    in order to formalize the concept of ` willing to have what they are having '",
    ", we modify individual mean - variance objective functions by penalizing deviations from other investors portfolios , which is defined as a non - negative quadratic norm pre - multiplied with an individual parameter of mimicking desire .",
    "this quadratic norm measures the distance between the vector of individual portfolio weights and the vector of ( aggregated ) portfolio weights of all investors in the group .",
    "the individual penalty parameter in our context has a clear economic interpretation as a measure of how unwillingly the saver deviates from the portfolio composition of the rest of the group .",
    "thus , we interpret a desire to ` keep up with the joneses ' as an economic motivation for the introduced ( penalized ) norm constraint for individual mean - variance portfolio investors .",
    "the introduced mimicking desire can be seen as a kind of generalization of mean - variance analysis of tracking error ( cf .",
    "roll 1992 ) as we allow for a balance between risk aversion and mimicking ( tracking ) coefficients .    as in our setting an individual saver is unaware about risk aversions and mimicking coefficients of other group members , the stated portfolio problem remains infeasible for individuals . in order to overcome this difficulty , we introduce a concept of a mutual fund which functions as an investment club ( barber and odean 2000 ) and aggregates preferences of our individual investors ( gilboa et al .",
    "2004 , gollier , 2007 ) .",
    "further , assume that the fund managers are aware via personal communications about the risk attitude and mimicking desire of individual savers , so that it can exploit this information for resolving the stated optimization task .",
    "the role of personal communications for financial decisions is empirically documented e.g. by hong et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , ivkovic and weisbenner ( 2007 ) , li ( 2014 ) , pool et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . introducing such fund",
    "allows to obtain the compact explicit analytical solution for the penalized portfolio problem . for this purpose , we first show that the aggregate penalized mean - variance objective function of the mutual fund can be equivalently represented as a mean - variance problem with modified risk attitudes .",
    "then , relying on this representation , we derive the optimal portfolio compositions both for the fund and for individual savers .",
    "the resulting vector of the optimal portfolio weights depends on the moments ( the expectation vector and the covariance matrix ) of asset returns , risk aversions and coefficients of individual mimicking desire .",
    "as expected , due to informational advantage of the fund this optimal solution allows to individual investors to achieve higher values of the objective function compared to the case of neglecting their desire to mimic .",
    "the major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we relate imposing particular constraints on the norm of portfolio weights to a behavioral phenomenon for social learning which , however , remains infeasible as the investors do not know preferences of each other .",
    "second , we introduce a mutual fund which aggregates individual preferences and derive the analytical expression for the optimal portfolio compositions of individual savers .",
    "finally , we quantify the benefits of pooling money to the mutual fund in case of savers willing to mimic within a comprehensive numerical study .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we formulate the mean - variance portfolio problem and introduce a mutual fund for learning and aggregating individual preferences . in section 3 , we formalize mimicking behavior in portfolio selection by imposing an additional norm constraint on the objective function . then we show that this aggregated penalized objective function can be equivalently written in the form of a mean - variance representation and present the analytical solution of this portfolio problem . in section 4 ,",
    "we quantify benefits of holding the mutual fund by means of the numerical analysis .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper , whereas the proofs are provided in the appendix .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath0 risky assets with the vector of returns @xmath1 characterized by the expectation vector @xmath2 and the covariance matrix @xmath3 , which is assumed to be symmetric and positive definite .",

    "] of the individual optimization task in ( [ mvi ] ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the vector of the global minimum variance portfolio ( gmvp ) weights .",
    "the gmvp is the starting point of the mean - variance efficient frontier with the mean portfolio return @xmath23 and the variance @xmath24 .",
    "the return and variance of the @xmath12th investor s portfolio are given as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "this solution corresponds to the mean and variance of a portfolio referring to the efficient frontier .",
    "note that the optimal portfolio proportions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for all @xmath7 , are different only for investors with distinct risk aversions @xmath6 and only if risky assets exhibit distinct expected returns .",
    "if all expected returns are equal such that @xmath29 , the gmvp should be selected by all investors independent on their risk aversion coefficients ( cf . bodnar and okhrin , 2013 ) .",
    "now consider a mutual fund which possesses the same information about the available investment opportunities , i.e. about @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "additionally , the fund knows the risk aversions @xmath32 of all investors , for example , this information could be obtained via personal communication .",
    "further assume that the mutual fund just collects money from individual savers so that its own objective function is defined as a wealth - weighted linear combination of individual objective functions ( cf .",
    "gilboa et al . , 2004 ) : @xmath33 note that the only informational advantage of the fund is the knowledge of individual investors preferences .",
    "thus , our fund can be seen as a kind of investment club ( cf . barber and odean 2000 ) where people interchange their opinions and make trading decisions together .",
    "then the portfolio weights of the fund are given as @xmath34 , or , in the vector notation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 summarizes portfolio compositions of all @xmath38 individual savers .",
    "accordingly , the fund portfolio return is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , the optimal ( aggregated ) portfolio composition of the mutual fund is given as the solution of the task @xmath40 w.r.t .",

    "the mean and the variance of the fund portfolio return are given , respectively , as @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the optimal portfolio compositions of individual investors are contained in the matrix @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that the information about risk aversions of individual savers is available to the mutual fund but not to individual investors which are not aware about preferences of each other .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that the mutual fund can not bring additional advantages for individual savers in this setting , because its optimal portfolio compositions is merely a weighted average ( linear combination ) of the individual optimal portfolio holdings .",
    "this result , however , would be different under assumption that individual savers incline to mimic behavior of each other .",
    "we consider this case in the next section .",
    "the mutual fund introduced in previous section has an information advantage compared to individual savers due to the knowledge of risk aversions . in this section ,",
    "we show that this informational advantage appears to be relevant for investment decisions in cases where individuals do not want to hold portfolios which strongly deviate from aggregated holdings of others .",
    "since this behavior implies readiness to account for decisions of others we denote this phenomenon as a desire to mimic in a portfolio selection context .",
    "the behavioral explanation of this phenomenon roots in the well - documented human inclination to mimic actions ( decisions ) of others ( cf .",
    "devenow and welch , 1996 ) as well as on social learning arguments ( park and sabourian 2011 , bursztyn et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "in our setting investors are unaware about preferences of each other , so that they can not mimic themselves but availability of the mutual fund allows to resolve this problem .      now , we introduce the mean variance portfolio problem with mimicking by adjusting individual objective functions such that they incorporate a penalty component . in particular , for the @xmath12th investor we penalize deviations of the investor s portfolio composition from the aggregate composition of the mutual fund which contains all individual portfolios in the group",
    ". then the optimization task of the @xmath12th investor has the following representation @xmath48 , \\quad { \\mathbf}{w}_{{\\mathbf}{f}}={\\mathbf}{w}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$ } } , \\quad \\mbox{w.r.t . }",
    "\\quad { \\mathbf}{w}'_i{\\mathbf}{1}=1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the penalty factor @xmath49 is an individual coefficient of mimicking inclination .",
    "a large value of @xmath50 implies that the @xmath12th investor is definitely willing to hold a portfolio composition which is ` close ' to compositions of others , i.e. exhibits a stronger desire to mimic .",
    "this is in line with ahern et al .",
    "( 2014 ) who find out that peer effects may lead to changes in risk aversions of group participants .",
    "using the covariance matrix @xmath31 for weighting the distance allows us to remain in the mean - variance framework which simplifies substantially the solution of this portfolio problem .",
    "note that the case without mimicking desire @xmath51 for @xmath52 corresponds to the classical mean - variance framework which is considered in section 2 .",
    "it is known that penalty components as introduced in equation ( [ cmvi ] ) are useful for a practical portfolio choice . imposing various constraints on portfolio weights",
    "are recently applied in practical portfolio selection by ( among others ) jagannathan and ma ( 2003 ) , brodie et al . , (",
    "these constrains were suggested in order to cope with estimation risk in the portfolio weights by relying on ideas behind robust statistical techniques , such as lasso or ridge regression ( cf .",
    "tibshirani et al . , 1996 , 2011 ) .",
    "thus , up to now the usefulness of constraints for portfolio weights is motivated solely by statistical argumentation .    in this paper",
    ", we reveal the economic motivation for imposing constraints as in equation ( [ cmvi ] ) .",
    "in particular , we claim that the intuition behind introduction of such penalty function is twofold .",
    "firstly , penalizing deviations in portfolio composition is related to a social learning phenomenon in financial markets where agents are eager to change their beliefs and behavior as a result of observing the actions of others ( park and sabourian , 2011 ) . empirically , there is a well - documented behavioral desire to mimic in financial market ( cf . devenow and welch , 1996 ) which relies on similarity arguments and is rather fundamental for human beings ( cf .",
    "gilboa et al . ,",
    "secondly , a desire not to be overperformed by peers ( e.g. , ` keeping up with the joneses ' argument ) would also impose mimicking desire of an individual saver by portfolio composition .",
    "thus , imposing constraints on portfolio weights introduced in the mean - variance optimization task ( [ cmvi ] ) has not only statistical but also economical motivation .",
    "the mimicking desire is formalized above by penalizing the distance between an individual portfolio composition and the aggregated holdings of the mutual fund . since",
    "the investor @xmath12 remains unaware about risk aversions and mimicking coefficients of other investors in the group , the optimal solution of the problem in ( [ cmvi ] ) appears to be individually infeasible .",
    "since the mutual fund possesses this information , it can help individual investors to find the optimal solution of ( [ cmvi ] ) .",
    "next we show analytically that individual investors with mimicking desire would get advantage by having such fund ( investment club ) at hand .    as earlier , we aggregate objective functions of individuals willingness to mimic , so that the objective function is given as : @xmath53 , \\qquad \\mbox{w.r.t . }",
    "\\qquad { \\mathbf}{w}'_{{\\mathbf}{f}}{\\mathbf}{1}={\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}}'{\\mathbf}{w}'{\\mathbf}{1}=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the idea to aggregate portfolio holdings allows to obtain the explicit solution for the optimal portfolio , which can not be achieved without this step ( cf .",
    "brodie et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "in order to solve analytically the optimization task in ( [ eq : eu * ] ) , we rewrite the aggregate optimization problem such that it has a mean - variance representation .",
    "denote the vector of individual mimicking coefficients by @xmath54 and the corresponding diagonal matrix as @xmath55 .",
    "the diagonal matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 contain information about the risk aversion coefficients and the relative wealth of each investor , respectively .",
    "the mean - variance form of the mutual fund objective function given in ( [ eq : eu * ] ) is provided in the following proposition .    the aggregated objective function of ` n ` mimicking investors @xmath58 defined in ( [ cmvi ] ) and ( [ eq : eu * ] ) has the following equivalent mean - variance representation : @xmath59\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\prime{\\mathbf{w}}^\\prime{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\mu$}}}-\\dfrac{1}{2}{\\mbox{tr}}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$a$}}}{\\mathbf{w}}^\\prime{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}}{\\mathbf{w}})\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the mimicking matrix @xmath60 of dimension @xmath61 is given by @xmath62    the proof of proposition 1 is provided in the appendix .",
    "the statement of proposition 1 allows to obtain the solution of the mutual fund mean - variance problem by using the standard portfolio optimization toolkit , as it is done below .",
    "since the return on the mutual fund portfolio is given as @xmath63 , our task is to find the optimal portfolio weight @xmath36 matrix @xmath64 which contains the information about all individual portfolios .",
    "the corresponding optimization problem @xmath65 \\qquad \\mbox{w.r.t.}\\qquad { \\mathbf{w}}^\\prime{\\mathbf{1}}_k={\\mathbf{1}}_n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is solved analytically in theorem 1 which is proven in the appendix .",
    "consider ` n ` individual investors with the aggregate objective functions given in ( [ mv1 ] ) .",
    "then the optimal mimicking portfolio weights are given by @xmath66 where the matrix @xmath67 is symmetric and positive definite .",
    "since it holds that @xmath68 and @xmath69 the mimicking ( aggregated ) optimal weights of the fund are given as @xmath70 whereas the mean and variance of the fund portfolio return in the case of mimicking are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "thus , the mimicking behavior has impact only on the aggregate risk aversion coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "the most important special cases of theorem 1 are summarized in corollary 1 . in particular",
    ", it provides the solutions of the portfolio problem for the cases of ( a ) equal wealth for all investors @xmath74 ; ( b ) equal mimicking coefficients for all investors @xmath75 ; ( c ) equal risk aversions and equal mimicking coefficients for all investors .",
    "the important special cases resulting from theorem 1 are given as :    a.   suppose equal wealth of all investors @xmath74 .",
    "then the mimicking matrix @xmath60 is given by @xmath76 and the corresponding optimal weights of the fund portfolio are equal to @xmath77 b.   suppose equal mimicking coefficients for all investors , i.e. @xmath75 for all @xmath78 .",
    "then the symmetric mimicking matrix @xmath60 is always positive definite and given by @xmath79 the corresponding optimal portfolio weights of the fund are given as @xmath80 c.   assume that all investors have the same risk aversion and mimicking coefficients , i.e. @xmath81 and @xmath82 for all @xmath78 . then the optimal portfolio weights for savers willing to mimic coincide with a non - mimicking mean - variance portfolio composition given by ( [ noncoop ] ) .",
    "the results of corollary 1 imply that the desire to mimic is primarily reasonable for comparative small values of risk aversions and mimicking coefficients as well as for the positive norm @xmath83 .",
    "otherwise the optimal portfolio composition would be the gmvp , which is the same for all investors .",
    "as in practice the true distribution parameters @xmath84 are unknown and should be estimated , the estimation risk need to be taken into account in a portfolio selection procedure .",
    "since the ( deterministic ) mimicking desire enters only the expression for the aggregated risk aversion of the mutual fund @xmath43 , all statistical results derived by okhrin and schmid ( 2006 ) , bodnar and schmid ( 2011 ) apply directly for quantifying estimation risk in the optimal portfolio weights .",
    "a particular interesting case is to consider @xmath85 small investors . assuming that @xmath86 for @xmath87 which is very natural as it covers @xmath74 as a special case , we immediately obtain for @xmath88 with @xmath89 that @xmath90 because the part with @xmath91 appears to be of smaller order",
    "this allows to get the asymptotic formula for the aggregate risk aversion coefficient : @xmath92= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{\\beta_i}{\\alpha_i+\\phi_i}.\\ ] ] this result has a couple of interesting implications . using this approximation and jensen s inequality we are able now to find the asymptotic upper bound for the aggregate risk aversion coefficient @xmath73 , namely @xmath93 thus , investing into the mutual fund is reasonable for any @xmath94 sufficiently small otherwise the gmv portfolio is of interest .",
    "moreover , combining and inequality gives us the upper and lower bounds for the aggregated risk aversions of mimicking investors which are given by @xmath95 this implies that for a large number of investors @xmath38 with a social learning desire the aggregate risk aversion of a mutual fund increases compared to the non - mimicking case .",
    "this fact seems to be natural from the economic point of view as the mimicking desire takes into account the anxiety of the investors about the future uncertain outcomes . as a result",
    ", this anxiety drives the investors wish to be closer to the portfolio decisions of the ` rest of the group ' .",
    "using the results of theorem 1 and corollary 1 , we illustrate benefits of investing into the mutual fund for mean - variance portfolio investors willing to hold similar compositions .",
    "for this purpose we conduct a numerical study where we contrast portfolio investments with and without accounting for mimicking desire .",
    "in particular , we quantify changes in the optimal portfolio proportions as well as gains in the investor s objective function for different values of risk aversion and mimicking coefficients .    the study is designed as follows .",
    "we concentrate on a parsimonious case with @xmath96 risky assets and @xmath97 investors which are characterized by distinct positive risk aversion coefficients @xmath98 .",
    "both investors are assumed to have the equal amount of money , i.e. @xmath99 . the distributional parameters of asset returns are selected such that the annualized means of risky assets are equal to @xmath100 , @xmath101 , the standard deviations @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the correlation @xmath104 .",
    "this choice of distribution parameters is conform to the typical values used in finance textbooks for illustration purposes ( cf .",
    "copeland et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "our aim is to investigate the impact of ( @xmath105 ) and ( @xmath106 ) on the optimal portfolio composition in case of individual savers willing to mimic .",
    "we concentrate on analyzing the case of equal mimicking coefficients @xmath107 whereas the case of @xmath108 could be investigated in a rather similar line . in the first step , we select the mimicking coefficient @xmath109 as a value from the set @xmath110 for the given risk aversion @xmath111",
    ". then we vary the relation between risk aversions @xmath112 such that @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "these risk aversions are typical values applied in the mean - variance portfolio analysis ( cf .",

    "thus we analyze the cases where the mimicking and risk aversion coefficients are of the same order .",
    "the mimicking behavior should have impact on both optimal portfolio weights and the objective function .",
    "alterations in the optimal portfolio composition are quantified by considering the difference in the optimal weight of the first asset with mimicking ( feasible for the mutual fund ) and without mimicking ( feasible for individual savers ) : @xmath116 the optimal fund weights are given in equation ( [ eq : coopmf ] ) whereas no - mimicking weights in equation ( [ noncoop ] ) .",
    "the changes @xmath117 are plotted in figure [ fig:1 ] as functions of @xmath118 .",
    "denote by @xmath119 the maximal value of the objective function with mimicking desire given in equation ( [ eq : eu * ] ) which can be attained by the mutual fund .",

    "the corresponding solutions @xmath122 and @xmath120 are provided in equations ( [ eq : coopmf ] ) and ( [ noncoop ] ) , respectively .",

    "[ figures 1 and 2 about here . ]    in figure 1 we observe a non - linear dependence between change in the optimal composition @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the change in the optimal portfolio composition appears to be remarkable ( over 10% ) already for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which are quite realistic values of the mimicking and risk aversion coefficients .    the gains in the objective function ( [ eq : gainsof ] ) , visualized in figure 2 , are monotone increasing in @xmath118 .",
    "they are clearly pronounced already for quite small values of the mimicking coefficient @xmath109 , for example , the gains exceed the level of 10% for @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "these results show that pooling money into the mutual fund leads to quite remarkable benefits for individual investors with a willingness to mimic and justifies the fees which the fund can take for these advantages .",
    "thus , we establish another reason to invest into a mutual fund additionally to the well - recognized advantages such as diversification and liquidity benefits and/or professional performance by searching and processing relevant information ( see e.g. stracca 2006 , huang et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "in this paper , we consider mean - variance investors with distinct risk aversion coefficients and mimicking desire which corresponds to a wish to hold portfolios not very different from portfolio compositions of others .",
    "we show that such mimicking inclination corresponds to imposing additional constraints on the norm of portfolio weights , which is used in the recent literature in order to improve performance of the classical markowitz mean - variance procedure .",
    "economically , portfolio behavior with willingness to mimic corresponds to the well - known behavioral desire of social learning in the sense of staying close to portfolio decisions of others .",
