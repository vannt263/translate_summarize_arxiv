    "water can be ruptured at much smaller tensile stresses than theoretically expected  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the existence of small inhomogeneities in the liquid , which exist even when special care on the cleanliness of the water has been taken  @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneities , whatever their origin might be , have received the generic name `` cavitation nuclei '' , while the bubble generation produced in this way is termed heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "cavitation nuclei are generally long - lived and it is believed that they consist at least in part of a volume of gas  @xcite . this observation excludes the possibility of the inhomogeneities being free spherical gas bubbles , as these are unstable . to account for stable gaseous cavitation nuclei ,",
    "two types are distinguished in the literature : bubbles stabilized by a skin ( see ref .  [ ] and references therein ) and bubbles trapped inside a surface defect ( `` crevice model'')@xcite .",
    "the principle of the crevice model dates back to 1944  @xcite and has found extensive qualitative experimental evidence over the years .",
    "greenspan and tschiegg  @xcite , for example , reported that removing particles larger than 0.2@xmath0 m in diameter increased the tensile strength of water to about 200 bar ( see also refs .",
    "others found that the addition of suspended particles lowers the nucleation threshold  @xcite , while pre - experimental pressurization of water increases the nucleation threshold@xcite .",
    "although these findings are in line with the general idea of the crevice model , none of the experiments could quantitatively verify the theoretical crevice model as developed by atchley & prosperetti  @xcite in 1989 .",
    "one of the reasons is that their predictions are valid for a single cavity of a well - defined shape , while in practice the liquid usually contains a wide variety of nuclei of different sizes and shapes . even in ultrapure water with a controlled number of microparticles",
    ", the sizes of the nuclei present on the microparticles can exhibit size variations yielding a wide range of thresholds  @xcite .",
    "a step forward was achieved by bremond  _ et al . _ who were able to create monodisperse cavitation nuclei by trapping gas inside cylindrical holes of well - defined shape etched in silicon surfaces using standard lithography techniques  @xcite .",
    "not only was the position and size of the nuclei perfectly controlled , but the nucleation event itself was also highly reproducible , so that it could be followed in time with stroboscopic methods without the need of expensive high - speed cameras .    both conditions , the reproducibility of the experiment and the monodispersity of the nuclei present at fixed positions , are important ingredients of this paper",
    "here , we have downscaled the micropits of bremond _ et al . _",
    "two orders of magnitude , so that it becomes possible to experimentally verify the theoretical predictions made in the framework of the crevice model .",
    "this is the first aim of this paper .",
    "secondly , we explore the mechanisms leading to the deactivation of nuclei after a single nucleation event .",
    "in addition , we show that superhydrophobic cavitation nuclei can nucleate hundreds of times , without being deactivated .",
    "our observations and interpretations have implications for an increased understanding of the behavior of cavitation nuclei down to length scales of a few tens of nm ( `` surface nanobubbles '' )  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive description and development of the crevice model can be found in the paper of atchley & prosperetti  @xcite with extensions to any axisymmetric geometry , including cylindrical cavities , given by chappell & payne  @xcite . in both papers ,",
    "the authors predict the various nucleation thresholds as function of crevice shape , gas tension , and receding contact angle .",
    "atchley & prosperetti argue that a true nucleation event must be the result of the loss of mechanical stability of the nucleus , and calculated the threshold for two situations : the first threshold denotes the pressure at which the nucleus _ inside _ a crevice begins its unstable growth , and is the lowest pressure value belonging to a bubble reaching either the critical radius of curvature @xmath1 , or the receding radius of curvature @xmath2 , i.e. the radius of curvature at which the receding contact angle @xmath3 is reached .",
    "the second threshold is equivalent in definition , but holds for the bubble growing _ outside _ of the crevice mouth .",
    "the lower value of the first and second nucleation threshold is the one for which the bubble grows explosively out of the cavity . for the case of a bubble trapped in a cavity with volume @xmath4 with its interface at the crevice mouth",

    "let us now consider the case - which we will examine experimentally - of a cylindrical cavity with radius @xmath17 and depth @xmath18 , under the assumption that the initial gas - liquid interface at the crevice mouth is approximately flat ( i.e. we assume a negligible effect of the hydrostatic pressure and gas - saturated water ) , so that we can write @xmath19 . for @xmath20",

    "however , during the expansion phase of the cavitation bubble ( typically @xmath117 ) , gas diffuses from the cavity into the bubble , thus leaving the pit . the typical diffusion length scale is @xmath118 m , using the diffusion coefficient @xmath119 . in the cases studied here the pits are @xmath120 m deep , i.e. much smaller than the typical diffusion length scale . also , the volume of a typical bubble is @xmath121 larger than the volume of the nanopits , allowing the majority of the gas to move from the pit into the bubble . unlike the wall - normal case",
    "the different jet dynamics does not return the gas to the pit , which therefore remains full of vapor and is easily filled by the liquid .",
    "these conclusions agree with our experimental results . in the cases a - d we observed no differences between strong ( fig .  [ fig_cav_focus ] ) and weak ( figs .",
    "[ fig_exp_246 ] ,  [ fig_exp_495 ] &  [ fig_exp_53 ] ) bubble interaction : in both situations the pits were emptied after one nucleation event , in line with the explanations provided here .",
    "this situation can be compared with the previously mentioned continuous and long - lived emission of bubbles in carbonated beverages and the related phenomena observed with enhanced surfaces frequently used in boiling heat transfer  @xcite . in none of these cases the bubbles collapse and therefore the primary mechanism for the filling up and consequent de - activation of the pits is present .      to show the importance of the liquid jet into the pits , experiments using superhydrophobic nuclei are illustrative .",
    "cylindrical pits , etched in si(100 ) with a diameter of 4 @xmath0 m , were created with a superhydrophobic bottom layer ( see fig .  [ fig_sh ] ) , consisting of hydrophobic pillars of @xmath122 nm in diameter ( created through a black silicon etching process  @xcite and a hydrophobic fluoro - carbon top layer ) .",
    "the combination of hydrophobicity with roughness is known to create superhydrophobicity  @xcite with typical contact angles @xmath123 . when the bubbles were strongly interacting ( leading to wall - parallel jets ) , we observed that the pits remained active nucleation sites even after hundreds of shots ( see fig .  [ fig_sh ] ) . on the contrary , in the case of a single bubble ( wall - normal jet ) we observed that the micropits were deactivated after a few nucleation events . to explain this striking difference one really has to take the direction of the liquid jet into account",
    "apparently , the wall - parallel jet is not able to wet the superhydrophobic bottom of the pits , while the vigorous , ultra - thin jet directed towards the superhydrophobic bottom layer presumably pushes the liquid from the dewetted into the wetted state . from other",
    "work it is indeed known that a force may be required to overcome the energy barrier associated with this wetting transition  @xcite .",
    "once in the wetted state , the superhydrophobic pit is deactivated and can not be nucleated again , apart of course from drying the whole sample .",

    "in conclusion , atchley & propseretti s 1989 crevice model of cavitation nuclei is experimentally verified using nanoscopic well - defined nuclei .",
    "advanced etching techniques allowed us to create cylindrical pits down to 50 nm in radius with high accuracy in both their size , depth and mutual position . upon immersion in water , the hydrophobic nanopits trapped air and served as nucleation sites .",
    "stepwise lowering of the acoustic minimum pressure allowed us to determine the nucleation threshold at which the pits start to cavitate .",
    "we found that the experimental results are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this implies that in shock wave experiments the size of cavitation nuclei can be determined by measuring the pressure at which they start to nucleate .",
    "cavitation nuclei were deactivated after a single nucleation event , despite differences in width , depth and aspect ratios of the pits .",
    "the two mechanisms contributing to this effect are diffusion of gas out of the pit during the lifetime of the bubble and the subsequent aspherical collapse of the bubble .",
    "numerical simulations show that in the case of weak bubble - bubble interaction , a sharp wall - normal liquid jet is formed which hits the bottom of the cavities , thus vigorously wetting the pits .",
    "superhydrophobic nuclei can only be wetted thanks to this wall - normal jet . for strong bubble - bubble interactions with wall - parallel jets ,",
    "superhydrophobic pits remain active nucleation sites , even after hundreds of nucleation events , in contrast to standard hydrophobic pits . in systems",
    "were one wants to control the number of cavitation nuclei which do not deactivate , superhydrophobic pits may find applications .",
