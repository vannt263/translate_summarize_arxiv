    "it was recognized already in the sixties that the proton - neutron pairing may play a non - negligible role in the nuclei with equal numbers of protons and neutrons due to the particulary large spatial overlaps of the wave functions of both types of nucleons .",
    "one of the first methods developed to take into account such correlations were bcs - type approaches.@xcite it is however known that the bcs wave function violates the particle number conservation which is especially harmful in the cases of weak pairing and phase transitions . a generic feature of the results of bcs calculations generalized so as to accomodate neutron - proton correlations ( _ i.e. _ that take into account isoscalar and isovector pairs ) in self - conjugate nuclei is a sharp transition from like - particle to @xmath1 pairing modes .",
    "such a scenario is absent in the particle number conserving approaches which allow for the coexistence of different superfluid phases.@xcite    in the present study we propose an approach which is free of the deficiencies of the treatments  la bogoliubov .",
    "this method , called higher tamm - dancoff approximation ( htda ) , was already applied to study ground and isomeric states in heavier nuclei and to describe pairing correlations in high spin states.@xcite here we extend the htda formalism to take into account the proton - neutron pairing .",
    "the purpose of the method is to describe the pair diffusion phenomenon around the fermi surface as a particular , yet very important , part of some many quasiparticle excitations of the particle - hole type over a slater determinant vacuum @xmath2 .",
    "thus one can consider dealing with a kind of higher tamm - dancoff approximation or equivalently with a highly truncated shell - model calculation .",
    "the latter point of view makes it clear that the success ( _ i.e. , _ the fast convergence in terms of the number of considered quasiparticles ) of such a truncation scheme will depend on the realistic character of the vacuum in use .",
    "such a favorable situation may be expected when the vacuum is defined self - consistently from the mean - field carrying most of the single - particle ( sp ) properties ( even those yielded by the correlations ) associated with a given effective hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kinetic energy and @xmath5 an effective interaction .",
    "it is advisable to choose for the wave function @xmath2 the hartree - fock solution coming from the hf potential @xmath6 self - consistently obtained from the many - body reduced density matrix @xmath7 of the correlated solution for the desired number of particles and possibly taking into account various constraints ( _ e.g. _ , deformation ) and symmetries ( _ e.g. _ , time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "we have thus @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath6 being the one - body reduction of @xmath5 for @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 vacuum may now serve to construct an orthonormal n - body basis in which we will diagonalize hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) . in principle to build this basis we should consider the slater determinant corresponding to the 0p0h state and all the particle - hole excitations : 1p1h @xmath10 , 2p2h @xmath11 , 3p3h @xmath12 and so on .",
    "it is however obvious that in practice we need to truncate the space of particle - hole excitations .",
    "based on the former studies in the htda framework@xcite we may assume that the components of the pair excitation type will be dominant in the ground state . in the section [ results ]",
    "we will show for the case of @xmath13 and @xmath14 correlations that the other components are indeed of a minor importance .",
    "the total ground state wave function can be decomposed in the following way ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 denoting two different charge states ) @xmath17    the ensemble of products of slater determinants @xmath18 represents a complete orthogonal basis of the n neutrons and z protons physical space with real coefficients @xmath19 fulfilling the relation @xmath20 which guarantees the normalization of the function ( [ mbstpn ] ) .",
    "it is clear that this function has a good particle number @xmath21 . to obtain the correlated ground state one should perform the diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) in the given many - body basis .",
    "let us rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) in the following form @xmath22 where the independent quasiparticle hamiltonian @xmath23 reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the particle creation operator @xmath26 for @xmath27 being a particle ( unoccupied ) state and to the anihhilation operator @xmath28 in the case of hole ( occupied ) states .",
    "for @xmath29 we have : @xmath30 or @xmath31 , with @xmath32 indicating the single - particle ( hf ) energy corresponding to the particle or hole case , respectively . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) , the residual interaction reads @xmath33    the matrix element of the above given hamiltonian in the multi - particle multi - hole basis takes the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total particle - hole excitation energy calculated with respect to the vacuum @xmath36 .",
    "the residual interaction comprising only one- and two - body operators will merely contribute to the matrix elements in cases where the two many - body states are identical or differ by one or two particles .",
    "the many - body matrix elements of @xmath37 can be evaluated with the use of the wick theorem ( for details see ref.@xcite ) and expressed as sums of proper two - body matrix elements of the interaction @xmath5 .    in actual calculations with our approach",
    "we have used the skyrme force for the hf part of the problem . since the majority of the skyrme forces is not well suited to reproduce the data in the particle - particle channel we apply a @xmath38-force to define the residual interaction .",
    "using the zero - range force is well established in the context of like - particle and to a lesser extent of the proton - neutron pairing . to assess the validity of our approach at this early stage of the investigation of the proton - neutron correlations within the htda framework a substitution @xmath39 is therefore done for the residual interaction .",
    "the operators @xmath40 project onto spin - isospin subspaces @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the standard spin and isospin exchange operators .",
    "the main challenge in the exact pairing diagonalizations methods and shell - model like calculations is the large dimension of the matrix to be diagonalized . in the present study we use the lanczs algorithm@xcite within the code developed by parlett and scott@xcite which allows to search for the lowest energy solutions in a reasonable time .",
    "however , as will be shown in the following , the advantage of the htda method is that the amount of the many - body configurations within a given single - particle space that need to be taken into account is quite limited and the matrix diagonalization problem is far from attaining the difficulty level of typical shell - model calculations .",
    "the calculations within the htda framework which we will discuss here are performed for the ground state of the @xmath0ge nucleus as obtained in a skyrme - hf+bcs approach .",
    "we use the siii force for the particle - hole channel , seniority force in the bcs part and volume @xmath38 interaction to calculate two - body matrix elements in the htda part .",
    "the htda results presented here are non self - consistent .",
    "indeed , only one diagonalization of the htda hamiltonian matrix has been carried out for a hamiltonian @xmath44 obtained with the density @xmath7 corresponding to the hf+bcs calculation .      in the limiting case of vanishing proton - neutron correlations we obtain two decoupled problems , one for each charge state .",
    "let us discuss first the aspects of the basis truncation , both in single - particle and many - particle many - hole excitations terms .",
    "if the assumptions of the bcs theory are to hold , we may expect that the most important part of the ground state correlations will correspond to the pair excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ the situation where two particles in kramers degenerate hole orbitals are promoted to two kramers degenerate particle levels . in what follows",
    "we will restrict the many - body states first to take into account all possible 1p1h and 2p2h excitations including thus the one pair excitations in addition to the particle - hole vacuum .",
    "in further calculations only the states corresponding to one , two and three pairs excitations will be considered .",
    ".numbers of many - body configurations of different types depending on the number of sp levels in the window . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as we already stated we aim at including the @xmath46 pairing correlations within the htda framework . as above",
    "discussed in this preliminary study we limit the configuration space to the so - called one pair excitations in all channels .",
    "( 0p0h)@xmath47 , pn-(1p1h)@xmath48(1p1h)@xmath47 , pp-(0p0h)@xmath49(2p2h)@xmath50 , nn-(2p2h)@xmath49(0p0h)@xmath47 ) in the correlated wave function @xmath51 versus the ratio @xmath52 of the @xmath38-force strengths in isoscalar @xmath53 and isovector @xmath54 channels . ]",
    "since proton - neutron pairs may exist in both @xmath1 and @xmath45 channels the problem of adjusting the strength of the isoscalar pairing arises here .",
    "the interplay of @xmath1 and @xmath45 pairing being rather unclear , we will adopt the same value of the isovector pairing strength for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath55 channels and will treat the @xmath1 interaction strength as a free parameter",
    ". pairing correlations can be as well obtained in an isospin broken model with @xmath56 , nevertheless we do not see any argument supporting such a choice . ]     of the interaction strengths in isoscalar and isovector channels . the results concern calculations with @xmath1 @xmath55 pairs only and with all possible pairs taken into account . ]    within a given configuration space and @xmath45 strength adjusted as described in the precedent we perform the calculations as a function of the increasing @xmath1 coupling constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] the evolution of the probability of different components is plotted against the ratio @xmath57 the probability of the @xmath58 pair excitation becomes siginificant with respect to that of @xmath13 or @xmath14 pair excitation for @xmath59 which corresponds to the ratio value at which a @xmath55 superfluid solution is found in bcs(@xmath38)-type of calculations in this nucleus.@xcite the gain in energy due to the @xmath55 coupling is non - negligible which can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] where the contribution of different components to the correlation energy is depicted .",
    "it is worth noting that the increase of the energy is of a similar magnitude like that of bcs calculations with the approximate particle number projection of the lipkin - nogami ( ln)@xcite nonetheless a certain gain in the htda correlation energy due to the @xmath55 coupling occurs already in the range of parameters for which no @xmath55 pairing solution is found in the bcs+ln method ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we have presented a method explicitely conserving particle number in the context of describing isovector and isoscalar pairing correlations .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath1 pairs leads to a constant increase of the absolute value of the correlation energy . the expected benefit of the htda framework in yielding a much smoother decrease of correlations than when using a bogoliubov quasiparticle vacuum in weak pairing regimes is confirmed .",
