    "the production of quarkonium states in high energy processes has recently attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "the detection of s plays a fundamental role in the study of @xmath1 physics , because some of the most interesting final states of @xmath1 decays do contain a .",
    "it is therefore important to have a good understanding of all other possible sources of s , in particular the direct production .",
    "furthermore , the large production cross sections and the relative ease with which s can be triggered on even at small values of transverse momentum , make their observation a powerful tool to study hard phenomena in regions of small @xmath2 , which are otherwise inaccessible with the standard hard probes ( jets and vector bosons ) used in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "since we expect s to be mostly produced via gluon - gluon fusion , if a solid theory existed it could be used to get the best and most direct measurements of the gluon density of the proton at small @xmath2 .",
    "the data are there , plentiful !",
    "production models have existed for several years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review and references ) . however , it is only with the advent of the wealth of data from the high energy hadronic colliders [ 26 ] that significant tests of the theory have become possible , thanks to the big lever arm in cm energy relative to the fixed - target experiments , and thanks to the wide range in transverse momenta that can now be probed .",
    "the comparison of these data with the models available up to a couple of years ago has shown dramatic discrepancies , the most striking one ( theory predicting a factor of 50 fewer prompt  than measured by cdf @xcite ) having become known as the `` cdf anomaly '' .    attempts to explain the features of these data have led in the past couple of years to a much deeper theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of quarkonium production .",
    "none of these developments would have been possible without the significant achievements of the experiments , to which most of the credit should go . in this review",
    "i summarize the evolution of the theoretical models towards what we can consider today as the seed of a theory of quarkonium production based on qcd .",
    "i will not have time to cover , however , the series of papers @xcite  that proposed the existence of new exotic charmonium states to resolve the conflict between data and theory .",
    "the language i use is inspired by a space - time picture of the production process , and in my view should appeal to the generic reader for its simplicity .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that most of the qualitative statements that will be made can be rephrased in more rigorous terms , as discussed in the references that will be quoted .",
    "production of quarkonium represents a challenging theoretical problem , as it requires some understanding of the non - perturbative dynamics responsible for the formation of the bound state .",
    "the problem could be made easier by assuming the existence of some factorization theorem that allows the separation of the dynamics of the production of the heavy quark pair from its evolution into a bound state .",
    "the reason why this assumption would make things simpler is that we could , in the presence of factorization , parametrize the non - perturbative part in a universal fashion in terms of a limited set of parameters : having been determined once ( for example by fitting some set of data ) , these can then be used to perform predictions .",
    "the assumption of factorization is reasonable , since the time scales associated to the two phenomena are significantly different : in the production of the quark pair , the relevant time scale is the inverse of the mass of the heavy quark , or of its transverse momentum in the case of high - production . in the formation of the bound state ,",
    "the important time scale is of the order of the inverse of the quarkonium binding energy , something of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , by the time the bound state starts forming , the memory of what the source of the heavy quark pair was has been lost .",
    "however , the quarkonium state has well defined quantum numbers , and one might suspect that only heavy quark pairs _ prepared _ by the hard process in specific states have a chance to eventually evolve into a given bound state .",
    "selection rules could therefore prevent the loss of memory , and spoil factorization .    determining to which extent , and in which precise form",
    ", factorization holds , is therefore the primary challenge that we are faced with when formulating a production model .",
    "i will now shortly describe the two most popular models which have been proposed in the past , the so - called `` colour evaporation '' ( cem , @xcite ) and `` colour singlet '' ( csm , @xcite ) models .",
    "they are based on orthogonal assumptions about the validity of factorization and , needless to say , lead to significantly different predictions . in a later section",
    ", i will show how these models evolved in the recent past into a more sophisticated approach , developed within qcd , which can apparently explain the main features of the data currently available .      in the colour evaporation ( also known as local - duality ) approach ,",
    "factorization is assumed to hold strictly .",
    "differential distributions for the production of a given quarkonium state @xmath4 are assumed to be proportional to the production rate of a pair of heavy quarks with invariant mass in the range @xmath5 : = a_h _ 2 ^ 2m_d d .",
    "here @xmath6 is the heavy quark that forms the bound state ,  is its mass and @xmath7 is the mass of the lightest meson carrying open flavour @xmath6 , the @xmath8 meson in the case of charm , or the @xmath1 meson in the case of bottom ;  is the invariant mass of the produced heavy quark pair .",
    "the justification of this model stems from the assumption that only quark pairs below the threshold for production of open flavour can possibly bind into a quarkonium state , and that provided the quark pair has mass below this threshold , the correct quantum numbers for @xmath4 will be recovered via non - perturbative emission ( _ evaporation _ ) of very soft gluons .",
    "the constant @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , depends on the state @xmath4 we are interested in , but is otherwise independent of the  of @xmath4 , and of the nature of beam and target .",
    "therefore , while the model can not estimate absolute cross sections , it however predicts their  and @xmath11 dependence and it predicts ratios of production rates and distributions of different states to be a constant .    as an example , consider production at large : in this case the dominant mechanism for the production of heavy quark pairs with invariant mass close to threshold is the splitting of a high-  gluon : @xmath12 .",
    "the probability for this splitting to take place can be calculated in leading order ( lo ) qcd as : = , and therefore : & = & a_h _ 2 ^ 2m_d d ( ) + & = & a_h ( ) ( ) = a_h ( ) , where we defined @xmath13 .",
    "attempts can be made to estimate what the relative values of @xmath9 for different states @xmath4 should be .",
    "for example , one could naively assume that a quark pair will evolve with a fixed probability into the closest state @xmath4 with mass @xmath14 .",
    "in this case , d(h ) ( 2j+1 ) , where @xmath15 is the mass splitting between adjacent states . in the case of charmonium , we would have for example @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18  , so that : [ psppsi ] & & ~1/3 + [ chichi ] & & ~ + [ chipsi ] & & _ j ( _ j ) br(_j ) / ( ) ~0.3",
    ". it is interesting to compare these naive predictions with data . from the publications of e705 @xcite ( 300 gev beams of pions or protons on nuclei ) ,",
    "the following ratios can be extracted : & & ~0.25 & & _ j ( _ j ) br(_j ) / ( ) ~0.6 the first result is also consistent with data from e789 @xcite , if the fraction of s from @xmath19 decays is assumed to be of the order of 0.3 .",
    "results presented by d0 at this conference indicate a fraction of s from @xmath19 s of approximately 0.4 , however with a strong  dependence . likewise , cdf reported a value for this fraction of approximately 0.3 , again with some  dependence .",
    "cdf also measured the fraction of @xmath20 production relative to the total of @xmath21 , of the order of 0.5 .",
    "all of these numbers come quite close to the naive expectations given in eqs .",
    ". the measurement of the total cross sections for @xmath22 production by cdf @xcite  has also been shown to be consistent with the @xmath11 dependence predicted by the colour evaporation model @xcite .",
    "therefore , while not completely satisfactory and not a real theory , it is clear that the colour evaporation model presents some features of universality that are consistent with the observed data , and that should therefore be maintained by the final theory , however complicated this might be .",
    "the colour singlet model @xcite , at least in its early formulation , emphasizes more the constraints imposed by the colour and spin selection rules . in the csm ,",
    "one projects the amplitude for the production of a heavy quark pair directly onto a state which has the right quantum numbers to form a given quarkonium state .",
    "this projection singles out only the right combinations of colour and spin required , and allows the absorption all the non - perturbative physics of the confinement into a single parameter , namely the value of the wave function ( or derivatives thereof ) of the quarkonium state at the origin .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath23 production this can be achieved by evaluating the following expression @xcite : m((p ) ) = _ ( p ) tr [ o^ij ^(p+m ) ] where @xmath24 is the matrix element for the production of a @xmath23 state of momentum @xmath25 and mass @xmath26 , @xmath27 is its polarization vector , @xmath28 is the wave function at the origin , and @xmath29 is the matrix element for the production of the heavy flavour pair ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the colour indices of quark and antiquark ) , with the constraint that the relative momentum between the two quarks be 0 .",
    "similar projection operators can be evaluated for any @xmath32 state @xcite , and convoluted with heavy quark production matrix elements calculable in qcd .",
    "absolute predictions can therefore be made for the production rates , once we introduce the values of the wave functions that can be extracted from potential models or directly from the data on quarkonium decay widths .    in the case of hadronic collisions , and at the leading order in , namely @xmath33 , it is easy to show that the only diagrams that are relevant for the production of a @xmath23 state are those shown in fig  [ fpsi]a . at large transverse momentum , a simple kinematical analysis of the momentum flow in the two internal quark propagators shows that they are off - shell by approximately @xmath34 . as a result ,",
    "the square of the matrix element will behave at large  like @xmath35 .",
    "this is a much steeper fall than that of standard hard processes , such as jet production , where the behaviour is that typical of a gluon or quark exchange , @xmath36 .",
    "a similar analysis can be done in the case of large-  production of @xmath19 states , which is dominated by diagrams like the one shown in fig  [ fpsi]b . here",
    "helicity conservation at the triple gluon vertex causes the internal gluon propagator to behave like @xmath37 , and the total amplitude squared is therefore only suppressed by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the  distributions of  and @xmath19 as predicted at the lo by the csm are totally different , contrary to what is assumed in the cem .",
    "such a steep  dependence has been proved to be inconsistent with the tevatron data , where the accessible range of  is very large @xcite . aside from the technical details of how this behaviour arises from the diagrams ,",
    "there is a simple reason why the csm predicts such a strong suppression of high-  quarkonium production at lo . in the csm ,",
    "one forces the heavy quark pair to be in the right state already at time scales significantly earlier than the time at which the formation of the bound state starts .",
    "this requirement produces a strong penalization in rate , which becomes more and more severe at higher .",
    "in fact at large  the time available for the pair to organize itself into a state with the right quantum numbers becomes shorter , and we pretend that it holds together , with nothing happening to it which could change its state , until the exchange of coulomb gluons takes over and binds it .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself with a strong form - factor - like suppression of the production at large , typical of such exclusive processes .",
    "since the probability that the quark pair can be found in the right state depends directly on the details of the hard process which produced the pair , it should come as no surprise that no universal factorization applies in this case , and that the  slopes of  and @xmath19 differ .",
    "it is possible @xcite  to incorporate within the csm the effect of longer time scales by considering higher - order contributions in perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "for example , one could consider production of the heavy quark pair from gluon splitting at large  ( as in the case of the cem ) , and describe the _ perturbative _ evolution of this pair into a colour singlet state with the right quantum numbers via gluon emission .",
    "the gluon virtuality before its splitting is of the order of the quarkonium mass , and the time available for the quark pair to evolve into the right state is larger than for the lo process . since we allow for the emission of gluons after the creation of the pair , the process is no longer exclusive , but rather an inclusive fragmentation process , and the form factor suppression is avoided .",
    "in the case of  production , diagrams which contribute to the production via fragmentation first appear at @xmath39 in pt ( see fig .",
    "[ fpsi]c ) .",
    "they are therefore suppressed by a factor @xmath40 relative to the lo contributions . however , their  behaviour is governed by the exchange of the gluon in the @xmath41-channel , and is therefore given by @xmath36 .",
    "the ratio of fragmentation over lo cross sections is then of order @xmath42 .",
    "this becomes larger than 1 as soon as  is larger than few times the quarkonium mass , namely in the region where the tevatron data come from .",
    "the lesson to be learned is that in the case of quarkonium production , naive  power counting does not establish by itself the correct perturbative expansion , in spite of the smallness of .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the leading - order terms in  represent contributions that should be considered as _ higher - twist _ corrections .",
    "the inclusion of fragmentation contributions bridges the gap between the two extreme philosophies of the cem and of the csm : in the fragmentation approach , factorization is achieved via the separation between the production of a hard ( but almost on - shell , relative to the global @xmath43 of the hard process ) gluon and the evolution of this gluon into a given quarkonium state .",
    "this evolution is described by universal , although state - dependent , fragmentation functions , which replace the simple - minded overall constant @xmath9 introduced in the cem .",
    "fragmentation functions for all states of interest have been calculated over the past couple of years @xcite , and have been used for phenomenological studies @xcite . in the case of @xmath19 production , the theoretical calculations agree with the available data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fchi ]  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath23 states ,",
    "however , the discrepancy in overall normalization is striking , although the distribution fits the data well ( see dotted and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fpspdata ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is that while fragmentation contributions are fundamental to produce the right  dependence , and are sufficient to correctly predict the absolute normalization of the @xmath19 cross section , there must be additional contributions to explain the abundance of  produced .      in order to understand the possible origin of these residual discrepancies",
    ", one has to look more closely into the structure of the fragmentation process within the csm . in the case of fragmentation into a @xmath23 state , the transition of a gluon into the @xmath44 state and only one gluon is forbidden .",
    "therefore emission of at least two gluons is required ( fig .",
    "[ fpsi]c ) .",
    "it turns out from the explicit calculation of the fragmentation probability that only hard gluons contribute to this process : soft gluons occupy a small volume of phase space , and there is no dynamical enhancement in their emission .",
    "therefore the fragmentation probability is proportional to @xmath45 . on the contrary",
    ", the fragmentation of a gluon into a @xmath19 state requires emission of just one gluon , as allowed by the different quantum numbers of the @xmath46 states .",
    "furthermore , emission of a soft gluon is enhanced by the presence of a well known logarithmic infrared singularity @xcite , which can be regulated by noticing that the heavy quarks inside the bound state are slightly off - shell , therefore cutting off the singularity at an energy of the order of few hundred .",
    "so the probability for a gluon to evolve into a @xmath19 state is of the order of @xmath47 , as the large logarithm compensates the additional power of @xmath48 . as a net result , production of @xmath19 s",
    "is significantly enhanced relative to that of s .",
    "again one can interpret this phenomenon using time - scale arguments .",
    "since the evolution of a gluon into a  in the csm only involves the emission of hard gluons , the time scale for the transition is of the order of their energy in the virtual gluon rest frame . in the case of the @xmath19 , instead , the enhancement of soft gluon emission indicates that the lifetime of the heavy quark pair resulting from the gluon splitting , before it settles into the @xmath19 state , can be very long .",
    "bodwin , braaten and lepage developed recently a framework @xcite , based on non - relativistic qcd , in which such a long - lived state has a non - zero overlap with the @xmath19 . in their formulation , a quarkonium wave function is the sum of contributions coming from states in the fock space in which the heavy quark pair is accompanied by long - lived gluons . in the specific case of a @xmath19",
    ", one has : |_j= o(1 ) | q |q[^3p_j^(1 ) ] + o(v ) | q    @xmath49 refer to the colour state of the pair , and @xmath50 is the velocity of the heavy quark in the bound state .",
    "the first term in the expansion corresponds to the standard non - relativistic limit , in which the quarkonium is made just of the quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the second term corresponds to a state in which the pair , in a colour octet configuration , is accompanied by a gluon ( the angular momentum of the quark pair is different in the second state , as the gluon itself carries spin ) .",
    "it is precisely this second component of the @xmath19 state that has non - zero overlap with the long - lived pair coming from gluon splitting .",
    "its presence allows the infrared divergence alluded to above to be absorbed via a wave function renormalization , in a way which can be rigorously defined and extended to higher orders in pt , and which does not have to rely on an arbitrary ir cutoff .",
    "the final picture we obtain is therefore as follows : the fragmentation function for production of a @xmath19 state from gluon evolution consists of two pieces .",
    "one is of order @xmath40 , and corresponds to the creation of a heavy quark pair with the emission of a perturbative gluon , the quark pair being projected on a short time scale on the @xmath51 state .",
    "the other is of order @xmath52 , and corresponds to the creation of a quark pair in the @xmath53 state .",
    "this state will evolve on a long time scale into the required @xmath51 state via emission of a non - perturbative gluon .",
    "the separation of short time scales from long ones is arbitrary , but the result is independent of it , as its redefinition only leads to a change in the relative importance of the two contributions .",
    "the production of @xmath19 through this second component has been named `` colour octet mechanism '' ( com ) . since it turns out that , for charmonium , @xmath48 is numerically of the same order as @xmath54 , the two channels are competitive .",
    "braaten and fleming @xcite  suggested that a similar phenomenon might play a key role in  production as well .",
    "colour octet states do in fact appear in the expansion of the @xmath23 state @xcite : |&= & o(1 ) | q |q[^3s_1^(1 ) ] + o(v ) | q |q[^3p_j^(8 ) ] g + & + & o(v^2 ) ( | q |q[^3s_1^(1,8 ) ] g g + | q |q[^1s_0^(8 ) ] g + | q    decomposition which can be accessed by a gluon already at order , namely @xmath55 g g \\rangle$ ] .",
    "creation of this state via gluon fragmentation will be suppressed by a factor @xmath56 , but this can be compensated by the absence of the two extra powers of  that are required for production of the colour singlet state .",
    "so once again the two processes could be competitive .",
    "when one performs the complete calculation , numerical factors appear which leave the com as by far the dominant one . if we take for example the integral of the fragmentation functions @xcite",
    ", we obtain the following ratio of probabilities : 25 , where the two objects in the last ratio are defined in @xcite  and can be shown to be proportional to the square of the wave functions at the origin for the colour octet and colour singlet components of the  state , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath57 arises as a simple consequence of the phase space for the two additional gluons present in the final state of the colour singlet fragmentation . in order for the octet contribution to be larger than the colour singlet one by a factor of 50 ( the cdf  anomaly ) , it is therefore sufficient that [ vev ] o_^3s_1^(8 ) ~ v^4 o_^3s_1^(1 ) , where we used the fact that numerically @xmath58",
    ". this is exactly of the right order of magnitude implied by eq .  .",
    "the introduction of the com provides a potentially important new production channel that could explain the cdf  anomaly . unfortunately , aside from the generic feature that @xmath60 should be of order @xmath56 relative to @xmath61 , we have no precise estimate of its real value , although it is expected @xcite  that lattice calculations could provide it one day .",
    "what can be done , therefore , is to extract @xmath62 directly from the data , fitting the cdf measurement to the theoretical  distribution of  and  @xcite .",
    "the results of the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fpspdata ]  and [ fpsidata ] . as had already been shown by braaten and fleming",
    ", the predicted shapes agree very well in the case of the .",
    "now that data are also available @xcitefor the production of prompt s ( s not coming from either @xmath63 or @xmath19 decays ) , we can reach the same conclusion also for the lowest - lying @xmath23 state .",
    "had we only included the prediction of the csm , the disagreement with the  data would have been again of the order of 50 .",
    "the extracted values for the two new parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given in the figures , and it can be verified that they agree with the crude estimate given in eq .  .",
    "having determined the values of these unknown parameters , one can use them to predict rates in different experimental set - ups . in fig .",
    "[ fua1 ] , for example , we show the prediction for  production in @xmath66 collisions at 630 , compared to the ua1 data @xcite . in order to match the experimental analysis , which did not separate between different sources of @xmath67 production",
    ", we included the contribution of @xmath63 and @xmath19 decays as well .",
    "the theory is higher by a factor of 2 .",
    "it is possible that small-@xmath2 effects @xcite , which are expected to be responsible for the increase of the @xmath63 production rate at the tevatron w.r.t . to the nlo calculation by an additional factor of 30%",
    "relative to 630  @xcite , play an even more important role in the case of charm .",
    "this would cause our fit to the tevatron  and  data to overestimate the values of the parameters .    a comparison with fixed - target data , where the  values accessible are much smaller , will require additional work , in order to absorb into the nlo parton densities the collinear divergences which appear al low @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at these low s one will need to take into account the effects due to the intrinsic fermi motion of initial - state gluons in the proton @xcite .",
    "another important test of the com comes from the study of @xmath22 production . here the colour octet effects are however expected to be smaller , as @xmath50 is smaller .",
    "nevertheless the complete calculation of @xmath22 rates within the colour singlet model predicts cross sections which are smaller than data @xciteby a factor of 3 in the case of 1s and 2s states , and by a factor of 9 in the case of the 3s .",
    "while the factor of 3 discrepancy between the csm prediction and the data could be explained by the addition of the com contributions , the relative factor of 3 discrepancy between the rates of 3s and 1s and 2s states is puzzling .",
    "it is very tempting to assume that a yet unseen third set of @xmath68 states , @xmath69 , exists below threshold , and decays radiatively to the 3s state .",
    "various potential model calculations of the bottomonium spectrum support this idea",
    ". simple - minded estimates of the @xmath69 contributions show that this process can correct the 3s yield by the required factor of 3 .",
    "the shapes of the  distributions are in principle sensitive to the resummation of multiple soft gluon emission from the initial state , as the values probed by the experiments are small relative to the mass of the @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fups ]  shows for example the effect of an additional @xmath70 kick of the order of 23 gev on the lo distributions , compared to the @xmath71 cdf data .",
    "the comparison with the d0 data is similar , both in rate and shape .    shortly after this conference ,",
    "cho and leibovich @xcitepresented a full calculation of the contribution of the com to the @xmath22 rates , extrapolating to the @xmath72 system the values of the non - perturbative parameters obtained from the fits to the charmonium data . to properly describe the region @xmath73 , where most of the data come from and where the use of fragmentation functions is not appropriate",
    ", these authors performed the complete calculation of the lo feynman diagrams producing the @xmath53 state .",
    "their results indicate good agreement with the data , for the 1s and 2s states . in the case of the 3s state ,",
    "a residual factor of 3 discrepancy remains if one only includes the decays of the known @xmath68 and @xmath74 states .",
    "their detailed estimate of the effect of production and decay of @xmath69 states confirms nevertheless the view that their existence would solve even this residual problem .",
    "although they are hard to detect directly , it is not unlikely that future larger statistics accumulated at the tevatron will allow their unambiguous discovery .",
    "the field of heavy quarkonium production has enormously benefited from the recent measurements performed at the tevatron collider . very rarely in the recent past",
    "have experimental data been so important in guiding the development of a theory .",
    "the initial discrepancies by almost two orders of magnitude found between earlier models and the data have driven theorists to deepen their understanding of the underlying dynamics , and have eventually led to a solid framework within which to operate .",
    "the inclusion of the colour octet mechanism is now viewed as a necessity for the consistency of the theory , rather than as an _ ad hoc _ theoretical concoction . while the field is still in its infancy , and additional progress",
    "must be made before a complete theory is formulated and firmer predictions can be made , i believe one can conclude that we are on the right track .",
    "several calculations are in progress , which will eventually allow us to test the theory more thoroughly . +",
