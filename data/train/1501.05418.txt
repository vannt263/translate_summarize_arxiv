    "[ fig : sections ] .",
    "these successes include qcd jet production cross sections , which agree with sm predictions over large ranges in energy and many orders of magnitude , measurements of single and multiple @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , as well as multiple measurements of top quark production , both pairwise and singly and in association with vector bosons .",
    "moreover , run 1 of the lhc has also brought the discovery by cms and atlas of a ( the ? ) higgs boson  @xcite , whose production has by now been observed in three different production channels , as also seen in fig .",

    "a major theme of this talk is what we already know about this newly - discovered particle .",
    "meanwhile , over there in flavour space , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) description of flavour mixing and cp violation is also a pillar of the sm , but here the picture is more complex .",

    "moreover , there are several indications of anomalies in flavour physics : for example , the branching ratio for @xmath7 decay differs from the sm prediction by @xmath8 , and there are issues with @xmath9 universality in semileptonic @xmath10 decays  @xcite .",
    "the most significant anomaly appears in the @xmath11 angular distribution for @xmath12  @xcite , though the non - perturbative corrections need to be understood better .",
    "it has recently been suggested that these may be related to the intriguing excess in @xmath13 decay reported by the cms collaboration  @xcite , as discussed later . also worth noting are discrepancies in the determinations of the @xmath14 ckm matrix element , and there is still an anomaly in the diimuon asymmetry at the tevatron  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some anomalies do seem to be going away , such as the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath15 production , which now agrees with higher - order qcd calculations  @xcite , as does the @xmath15 rapidity asymmetry measured at the lhc .",
    "however , the discrete charm of flavour physics leaves many issues to be addressed during lhc run  2 and at superkek - b .",
    "one of the principal focuses during run  2 of the lhcwill be the more detailed study of the higgs boson and probes whether its properties deviate from sm predictions , e.g. , in the flavour sector . as i discuss later , the measurement of the higgs mass has produced new reasons to expect bsm physics , and the search for bsm physics will start anew at run  2 , with its greatly increased centre - of - mass energy and increased integrated luminosity .",
    "my personal favourite candidate for bsm physics is supersymmetry ( susy ) , and i also discuss later in this talk how susy models are constrained by flavour physics , as well as by the observations to date of the higgs boson and searches for bsm physics with run-1 data .",
    "this talk concludes with some remarks about searches for particle dark matter at the lhc and elsewhere , and some advertisements for possible future colliders .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson can be measured most accurately in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 final states , and atlas and cms both report accurate measurements in both these final states .",
    "atlas measures  @xcite @xmath18 and cms measures  @xcite @xmath19 some interest has been generated by the differences in the masses measured in these channels , but these have opposite signs in the two experiments : @xmath20 so are presumably statistical and/or systematic artefacts .",
    "combining naively the atlas and cms measurements yields @xmath21 in addition to being a fundamental measurement in its own right , and casting light on the possible validity of various bsm models , the precise value of @xmath22 is also important for the stability of the electroweak vacuum in the standard model , as discussed later .",
    "the fact that the higgs boson has been observed to decay into @xmath16 excludes spin 1 , and spin 0 is expected , but spins 2 and higher are also possible in principle .",

    "this is indeed consistent with the upper limits on low - energy effective flavour - changing interactions , but these would allow also lepton - flavour - violating higgs couplings much larger than the sm predictions , so looking for such interactions is a possible window on bsm physics .",
    "we estimated on the basis of low - energy data that the branching ratios for @xmath13 and @xmath44 decays could each be as large as @xmath45% , i.e. , as large as br@xmath46 , whereas the branching ratio for @xmath47 could only be @xmath48  @xcite .",

    "6 ) bsm physics is required for cosmological inflation , notably because in the sm the effective higgs potential would seem to become negative at high scales .",
    "7 ) a consistent quantum theory of gravity would certainly require going ( far ) beyond the sm .",

    "the effective electroweak potential of the sm resembles a mexican hat , invariant under the sm su(2)@xmath55u(1 ) symmetry .",

    "thus , in the sm the present electroweak vacuum is unstable , in principle , with quantum tunnelling though the brim generating collapse into an anti - de - sitter big crunch.    according to the sm calculations  @xcite shown in the left panel of fig .",
