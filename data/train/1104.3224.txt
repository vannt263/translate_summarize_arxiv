    "a spin variable representing each matchbox then sits at the centre of the cube on the dual lattice and any surface in the ensemble can be constructed as a product of the elementary matchboxes and unshaded cubes . when two shaded matchbox faces overlap they annihilate to give an unshaded face , so the shaded faces can be thought of as carrying a negative sign .",
    "the low temperature expansion of the dual hamiltonian @xmath31 gives precisely this structure , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent each of the possible matchbox orientations . in equ.([dual1 ] ) the spins @xmath32 and @xmath33 live on the vertices of the dual lattice and the sums are along its orthogonal edges @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "this can be seen explicitly by rewriting the hamiltonian in terms of the four double spins @xmath42 to give the 4-state potts hamiltonian @xmath43 where the sum now runs over all the edges orientations .",
    "4-state potts critical behaviour ( i.e. a first order phase transition in 3d @xcite ) is thus found in the isotropic case .    in the remainder of the paper we consider the behaviour of the 3d dual gonihedric hamiltonian , as formulated in equ.([dual2 ] ) as an anisotropic ashkin - teller model , in its own right .",
    "we first look at the ground state structure of the model , highlighting the similarities with the plaquette action and in the light of this discuss coupled mean field equations on a cube .",
    "we then report on monte carlo simulations which are sufficient to confirm the nature of the phase transition and look at the effect of different cooling rates on the low temperature behaviour .",
    "the ground state , mean field and monte - carlo investigations all highlight the difficult of formulating a standard magnetic order parameter , and we discuss the implications .",
    "in the isotropically coupled ashkin - teller model with equal positive couplings four equivalent magnetized ground states are possible , with the ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) spins taking the values ( @xmath46 ) at every site , so only paramagnetic or ferromagnetic behaviour is seen for the individual @xmath44 and @xmath45 spins in this coupling regime . to investigate the ground state / zero - temperature structure of the dual gonihedric model we use an approach which proved useful for the original undualized gonihedric model and consider possible spin configurations on an elementary cube @xcite .",
    "this is sufficiently large to capture non - trivial structure and the full ground state is then obtained by tiling the 3d cubic lattice with compatible single cube configurations .",
    "the full lattice hamiltonian may be written as a sum over the individual cube hamiltonians @xmath47 , @xmath48 where the additional symmetry factor of @xmath49 takes account of one edge being shared by four cubes .",
    "if a configuration of spins on a cube minimizes @xmath50 the full lattice ground state energy density will simply be given by @xmath50 .",
    "looking at the configurations in fig .",
    "( [ ground ] ) immediately makes it clear that there is considerably more freedom for possible ground states in the anisotropically coupled hamiltonian of equ.([dual2 ] ) than in the standard isotropic ashkin - teller model .",
    "in addition to the reference ferromagnetic ground states in fig .",
    "( [ ground]a ) it is possible to flip a single horizontal face of @xmath45 spins on the cube at zero energy cost as in fig .",
    "( [ ground]b ) , or a vertical face of either @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "( [ ground]c ) ) or both @xmath44 and @xmath45 spins ( fig .",
    "( [ ground]d ) ) on the differently oriented vertical faces .",
    "flipping _ two _ faces in the same orientation takes one between the different possible ground states of the standard isotropic model , so it is the ability to flip a single face at zero energy cost which confers the extra freedom in the anisotropic model .",
    "it is also possible to combine the differently oriented single face flips on the cube without increasing the energy of the configuration .",
    "tiling the entire lattice with such configurations then shows that ground states may contain flipped planes of @xmath44 , @xmath45 or @xmath51 spins ( depending on the orientation ) with respect to reference purely ferromagnetic ground states .",
    "it is possible for two orientations of flipped spin planes to intersect pairwise along a line or for three differently oriented planes to intersect at a point .",
    "the distribution of flipped spin planes in a ground state is thus completely arbitrary .",
    "the ground state degeneracy of the dual gonihedric model is thus similar to that of the original plaquette hamiltonian of equ .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) where ( possibly orthogonal , intersecting ) planes of spins may also be flipped at zero energy cost .",
    "values are shown at each site .",
    "the directions of the couplings in the hamiltonian are indicated , as are the faces on which spins are flipped .",
    ", height=302 ]    intriguingly , this leads to the same difficulties in defining a suitable magnetic order parameter for the dual hamiltonian as one faces with the plaquette hamiltonian . since arbitrary , and arbitrarily separated ,",
    "spin planes may be flipped at zero energy cost a standard , or even a staggered magnetization , will generically be zero in such a state .    of course , it is not guaranteed that ground state / zero - temperature degeneracies are maintained at finite temperature .",
    "indeed , for the original gonihedric model low temperature expansions by pietig and wegner @xcite showed that when @xmath52 , where it was still possible to flip arbitrary _",
    "parallel _ spin planes to give a sandwich ground state , the ferromagnetic state had a lower free energy at finite temperature .",
    "the degeneracy did , however , persist at finite temperatures for the @xmath0 model . in the case of the dual gonihedric model the monte - carlo simulations discussed below",
    "find @xmath53 in the low temperature phase , though there is a clear sign of a phase transition in the energetic observables and also the magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "this suggests that the flip symmetry persists at finite temperature throughout the low temperature phase .",
    "in the mean field approximation an expression for the free energy is written by replacing the exact values of the spins with average site magnetizations and adding an entropy term . to take account of non - trivial structure in such a calculation one can again work at the level of the cubes , as for the ground state , and write down the coupled equations for the sixteen site magnetizations on the cube .",
    "the calculation of the mean field free energy in this manner is thus a direct elaboration of the method used to investigate the ground states .",
    "the total mean field free energy is written as a sum of the elementary cube free energies @xmath54 , given by @xmath55 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{16 } \\sum_{i \\subset c}[(1+n_{i } ) \\ , \\ln(1+n_{i } ) \\ , + \\ , ( 1 - n_{i } ) \\ , \\ln \\,(1 - n_{i})\\ , ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the set of magnetizations of the elementary cube with @xmath57 the average site magnetizations for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 spins respectively .",
    "the log terms give the entropy for each of the types of spin .",
    "minimizing this free energy gives a set of sixteen coupled mean - field equations @xmath60 ( one for each corner of the cube and spin type ) rather than the familiar single mean field equation for the standard nearest neighbour ising action .",
    "the resulting equations are all of the form @xmath61\\nonumber \\\\       &   \\vdots & \\nonumber \\\\ m_{8}&= & \\tanh[\\beta ( m_{5 } + m_{7 } \\ , n_{7 } \\ , n_{8 } ) ]   \\\\       &   \\vdots & \\nonumber \\\\ n_{1}&= & \\tanh[\\beta   ( n_{5 } + n_{2 } \\ , m_{1 } \\ , m_{2 } ) ] \\nonumber \\\\       &   \\vdots & \\nonumber \\\\ n_{8}&= & \\tanh[\\beta ( n_{4 } + n_{7 } \\,m_{7 } \\ , m_{8 } ) ] \\nonumber \\label{e2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have labelled the magnetizations on a face of the cube counter - clockwise @xmath62 and similarly for the opposing face @xmath63 , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . if we solve these equations iteratively at different temperatures we arrive at zeroes for a paramagnetic phase or various combinations of @xmath10 for the magnetized phases on the eight cube vertices .        a potential problem with an iterative scheme to solve the system of mean field equations @xmath64 \\ , , \\ ; \\ ;    n_i^{(k+1 ) } = f_i[m^k , n^k ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is that it might fail to converge if an eigenvalue of @xmath65 or @xmath66 is less than @xmath67 @xcite .",

    "the mean field solution is then given by gluing together the elementary cubes consistently to tile the complete lattice , in the manner of the ground state discussion .",

    "<S> we investigate the dual of the @xmath0 gonihedric ising model on a @xmath1 cubic lattice , which may be written as an anisotropically coupled ashkin - teller model . </S>",
    "<S> the original @xmath0 gonihedric model has a purely plaquette interaction , displays a first order transition and possesses a highly degenerate ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dual model admits a similar large ground state degeneracy as a result of the anisotropic couplings and investigate the coupled mean field equations for the model on a single cube . </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out monte carlo simulations which confirm a first order phase transition in the model and suggest that the ground state degeneracy persists throughout the low temperature phase . </S>",
    "<S> some exploratory cooling simulations also hint at non - trivial dynamical behaviour . </S>"
