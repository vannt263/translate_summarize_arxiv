    "the composite dimension can be expressed in a generalized moran equation which can be solved numerically to find the composite dimension . *",
    "it is proved that , in general , the composite dimension is bounded by the minimum and maximum of the component dimensions , and independent of the order of different substages in a stage .",
    "we would like to mention that the composite dimensions found in this work are true for fractals which do not have overlapping segments or where there is no elements which intersect themselves during iteration .",
    "if there is overlapping , the composite dimensions presented here constitute upper bounds for the real dimension of overlapping figures .",
    "the difference between the real dimension and the upper bound depends on the degree of intersection of the shape .    in this work",
    "we have focused on the composition by simple and regular alternation of the iterations of the component fractals .",
    "the same method can be extended to more complicated cases where the number of substages changes with the increasing iteration or where the occurrence of substages is probabilist @xcite .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "we hope that the approach of composition ( or decomposition ) of fractals can find application in the study of fractal geometry as well as in the modeling of different structures and processes in nature .",
