    "today in quantum field theory , it is necessary to calculate increasingly complex feynman diagrams as the theory and the experiments require a higher accuracy of the scattering amplitudes ; a very good example of this being kinoshita s quest : to calculate @xmath4 up to @xmath5 order @xcite .",
    "several techniques have been applied for that purpose  most of them in the context of dimensional regularization @xcite or analytic regularization @xcite  and among them we can mention the powerful mellin - barnes contour integration @xcite , the method of gegenbauer polynomials @xcite , the differential equations technique @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the ndim developed by halliday and ricotta @xcite has shown itself as a reliable one when applied to the calculation of diagrams of one- @xcite , two- @xcite and multi - loops @xcite , with scalar and tensorial structures and in noncovariant gauges @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of ndim is that it allows us to avoid the often cumbersome parametric integrals , transfering the problem into easier solving systems of linear equations instead .",
    "another advantage of ndim is that the exponents of propagators are taken to be arbitrary integers , so that one can solve the general case for each type of graph .    despite of having these advantageous features which turn itself an efficient and simple method",
    ", ndim has some drawbacks pointed out in earlier works : the large number of systems of equations and the difficulty in dealing with the ever increasing complexity of the hypergeometric type series that results . related to this difficulty is , for example , the summing up analytically of hypergeometric series with unit argument , such as , @xmath6 that often appears in two - point function calculations . the approach to overcome the first difficulty , namely , to reduce the growing number of linear systems",
    " it grows with the number of loops and legs attached to the diagram at hand  was presented by gonzalez and schmidt for massless diagrams : they proposed a way to write down the generating gaussian integral in order to optimize ( to minimize ! ) such number .",
    "then the whole calculation can be made simpler and faster , and the number of hypergeometric functions @xmath7 left in the final result is also minimum .",
    "a great effort is being conducted in order to study maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( msym ) .",
    "several authors @xcite are tackling a rather difficult task : to calculate certain scattering amplitudes exactly since maldacena conjectures that higher loop contributions can be written in terms of one - loop amplitudes .",
    "tests of this conjecture have been realized from 4-point 2-loops to even more challenging 4-point 5-loops feynman amplitudes , involving the so - called dual conformal integrals .",
    "the outcome of this program can be a resummation of the entire perturbative series for a given physical process .",
    "the reason to have powerful methods to tame these integrals is clear .",
    "we present in this paper another way to apply ndim in feynman integral calculations , the `` gluing '' approach . in general a feynman diagram , e.g. , the 2-loop master diagram , is represented by an integral ,    @xmath8^{j}[(k - q)^{2}]^{l}(q^{2})^{m}[(q - p)^{2}]^{n}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the external momentum , and @xmath10 are exponents of propagators , which can be made arbitrary in the whole calculation .",
    "one could rewrite the above integral as , @xmath11^{j}}\\int\\frac{d^{d}q}{[(k - q)^{2}]^{l}(q^{2})^{m}[(q - p)^{2}]^{n}},\\label{1st_integral}\\ ] ] and we readily recognize the integral in momentum @xmath12 as an off - shell triangle one , which has a well - known result @xcite that can be written in terms of four appel hypergeometric functions of two variables @xmath13 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the remaining integral is a self - energy one with shifted exponents of propagators , @xmath14^{\\nu_{2}}},\\label{2nd_integral}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a factor which depends on @xmath16 as well as the exponents of propagators and dimension @xmath17 .",
    "the new exponents @xmath18 and @xmath19 also depend of the former ones @xmath10 , as well as of dimension and sum indices of @xmath0 functions",
    ". however , straightforward application of this does not yield the correct result . here comes an important point : to carry out the second integral ( [ 2nd_integral ] ) one has to perform the integral over the whole space , for this reason the result of the former one must hold on the whole range of momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the well - known result of the off - shell triangle , written as a sum of four appel s hypergeometric functions @xmath21 , _ is not valid _ for every momentum ; these momenta must be such that @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , the series is defined inside some region of convergence and for this reason the well - known result of boos and davydychev @xcite can not be used in ( [ 1st_integral ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we use ndim to solve a massless two - loop self energy diagram in a different approach as used before @xcite , namely , integrating loop by loop .",
    "we separate the diagram into two simpler parts , each one a single loop diagram itself and then solve these parts `` gluing '' them to obtain the final result .",
    "this technique of dealing with subdiagrams could simplify the solution of larger diagrams that would lead to difficult systems with a great number of equations and variables .",
    "as far as we know only bierembaum and weinzierl @xcite studied some feynman diagrams using similar ideas and mellin - barnes method .",
    "kostrykin and schrader presented a generalized kirchoff rule to `` gluing '' quantum graphs and they relied on a complicated star product @xcite .",
    "`` gluing '' diagrams is not a trivial task in quantum mechanics nor in quantum field theory .",
    "however , we think that if implemented such method can simplify computations , being very easy and reliable , since in order to calculate a multi - loop diagram one could , in principle , use only well - known one - loop integrals .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to elaborate this program within the ndim context .",
    "there are two manners to cut the two - loop diagram  here identified as `` flying saucer '' diagram  in the particular case presented in this work , as will be shown in sections @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the first manner involves a one - loop self - energy diagram that we call `` sword - fish '' , which is very simple to calculate .",
    "the second one uses the one - loop off - shell triangle diagram , which is written in terms of only three hypergeometric functions @xmath0  the form suitable for integrating the second loop  , a simplified result accomplished by invoking momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in section @xmath27 we show the integral pertaining to the `` flying saucer '' diagram and present the approaches to make the cutting",
    ". in section @xmath25 we solve first the `` sword - fish '' diagram , whereas in section @xmath26 we do it via the one - loop triangle diagram first and in section @xmath28 we present our concluding remarks .",
    "we will consider a particular case of the flying saucer diagram , the so called `` side view '' , as shown in fig .",
    "there is another type of this graph , which we call flying saucer `` front view '' .",
    "the difference between them is the exponent of the propagator of the particle with momentum @xmath20 . clearly the following gaussian integral",
    "is related to this diagram , @xmath30\\text{,}\\label{gaussiana}\\ ] ] in other words it generates the feynman loop integrals , see eq.(@xmath31 )",
    ".    one can integrate it and compare it with its own taylor expansion , @xmath32 where @xmath33^{l}[(k - q)^{2}]^{m}\\text{,}\\label{original}\\ ] ] which is our complete negative dimensional integral .",
    "we will show all the necessary steps for the cut cases in more details in the next sections , but for now it is enough to know that the solution of the complete diagram is , before the analytic continuation @xcite , @xmath34    @xmath35        where @xmath36 .    at this point , our new proposal is to cut the diagram , solve each part separately and then `` glue '' them together .",
    "we expect , of course , that the final result should be the same as in ( @xmath37 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the two manners to cut this diagram . the first way leaves a one - loop sword - fish graph plus a vertex , whereas the second way leaves a one - loop triangle and a propagator . in the next sections , we solve them in details .",
    "we begin with the generating integral ( @xmath38 ) , where one can integrate first in the @xmath12 momentum , @xmath39\\int d^{d}q\\exp[-\\alpha q^{2}-\\omega(k - q)^{2}]\\text{,}\\label{q momentum}\\ ] ] which represents a one - loop with two massless propagators . completing the square ,",
    "the @xmath12 integral can be solved easily , giving @xmath40   \\text{.}\\label{iq}\\ ] ]    expanding this result in taylor series and using the multinomial expansion , one obtains @xmath41 with the constraint @xmath42 coming from the multinomial expansion .",
    "the next step is to also expand the @xmath12 gaussian integral ( @xmath43 ) in taylor series ,        @xmath44    where @xmath45^{m}\\text{.}\\label{sword fish}\\ ] ]    this is the main sword - fish integral in negative dimension .",
    "the exponents of the propagators are _ positive _ and one has to consider a _ negative _ @xmath17 . in the end of the calculation , one does an analytic continuation of the result to _ negative _ exponents and _ positive _ @xmath17 . comparing ( @xmath46 ) and ( @xmath47 ) , an expression for the negative-@xmath17 integral can be written,@xmath48 where a product of gamma functions is defined,@xmath49    the kronecker s deltas in ( @xmath50 ) and the constraint of the multinomial expansion of ( @xmath46 ) form a system of three equations and three unknowns ,    @xmath51@xmath52{l}n_{1}+n_{2}=i\\\\ n_{1}+n_{3}=m\\\\ n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=-\\frac{1}{2}d \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{sistema sf}\\ ] ] that can be easily solved with a unique solution .",
    "the integral @xmath53 is then given by @xmath54 where @xmath55    with this result , it is straightforward to find the solution of the complete flying saucer diagram . from the taylor series ( @xmath31 )",
    ", it can be seen that the integral in @xmath12 is already done , so putting ( @xmath56 ) in ( @xmath31 ) , one has @xmath57^{l}\\text{,}\\label{almost}\\ ] ] but this is exactly the integral ( @xmath58 ) with the variables @xmath59 , that is , @xmath60 and , finally , @xmath61 which is exactly ( @xmath37 ) , with @xmath36 .",
    "this procedure to solve the flying saucer diagram is much simpler and faster than solving the complete diagram as it was done in @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we present the other mode of cutting the complete diagram .",
    "this is by far the most difficult and laborious way ; however considering the importance of the triangle diagram and the new result that we will show justify the whole process . instead of ( @xmath43 ) , one could begin with the @xmath20 integral : @xmath63\\int d^{d}k\\exp[-\\beta k^{2}-\\gamma(p - k)^{2}-\\omega(k - q)^{2}]\\text{,}\\label{k momentum}\\ ] ] that corresponds to a one - loop three point function .",

    "this last constraint subtly reduces the number of functions @xmath0 from _ four _ to _ three _ because those original four are not linearly independent as they should be to form a basis .",
    "two of them can be rewritten in terms of another function @xmath0 that pertains to one of the other sets of different kinematical regions ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "so , with the constraint of momentum conservation , there are only _ three _ linearly independent hypergeometric solutions @xmath0 and they hold on the whole space . in order to reduce the four functions @xmath92 in the solution ( @xmath90 ) , we need to combine two of them to give another @xmath92 in a different kinematical region",
    ". the right way to do this combining is given in @xcite considering the analogy between feynman diagrams and electric circuits .",
    "then , applying this to our case , we need to keep the first and the third terms , and the second and fourth ones are combined together using the relation @xmath93 to see that the resulting @xmath92 is exactly a function that appears in @xmath94 given in ( [ other solutions ] ) .",
