    "we have considered the effects of externally - applied resonant magnetic perturbations ( rmps ) on tokakamak edge turbulence and ideal ballooning bursts in 6-moment electromagnetic gyrofluid computations including zonal profile evolution .",
    "the interpretation of the l - mode like turbulence simulation results leads to the following physical picture .",
    "rmps give rise to plasma response currents which screen the vacuum perturbation fields . even for strongly ergodized vacuum perturbation fields , the amplitude of the intrinsic magnetic flutter and the resulting intrinsic ergodicity",
    "are hardly changed by rmps . as a consequence , the radial transport by parallel motion along radially perturbed magnetic field lines is not increased . even for strongly ergodic vacuum perturbation fields ,",
    "the radial transport is mainly due to fluid - like @xmath122 convection .",
    "as the plasma adjusts to the rmp - induced three - dimensional magnetic equilibrium , the convective transport is reorganized in terms of convection cells which are resonant with the toroidal and poloidal mode numbers of the perturbation fields .",
    "accordingly , the radial convective transport exhibits a stationary component which increases with increasing rmp amplitude . for the same reason ,",
    "rmps give rise to a decrease of the turbulent fluctuations in the thermal state variables , whereas the stationary contributions to the fluctuations increase .",
    "moreover , the rmp - induced stationary structures decelerate the poloidal plasma rotation . except for the imposed stationary structures , the drift - wave mode structure of the turbulent fluctuations",
    "is widely preserved .",
    "the computations faced the problem that the artificial dissipation slightly varied with the rmp amplitude .",
    "consequently , the total ( convective and magnetic ) transport was not completely preserved across the simulations .",
    "the problem was increased by an additional boundary dissipation which was found to be necessary for stable rmp simulations .",
    "the main findings ( screening of rmps by plasma response currents , dominance of the convective over the magnetic transport ) are not affected by this constraint . by contrast",
    ", a comparison between the absolute values of the fluctuations in the dependent variables has to be interpreted carefully .",
    "nevertheless , the tendency for an rmp - induced decrease of the fluctuations is clear .",
    "if rmps are applied to an ideal ballooning unstable `` h - mode''-like initial pedestal configuration , the profiles adjusts to the rmp - induced three - dimensional magnetic equilibrium and form resonant perturbations in the dependent variables .",
    "the interchange - ballooning drive increases the resonant perturbations so that they can grow faster than the most unstable mode of the perturbation - free case .",
    "the presented simulations constitute a first gyrofluid approach towards a simulation of rmp effects on edge turbulence and on elm mitigation . a direct mitigation of ideal ballooning mode bursts in modelled `` h - mode''-like states could not be observed .    in turbulence computations",
    "the rmp fields were found to considerably reduce the pedestal profile gradients ( to around a half for typical experimental perturbation field strengths ) . following this picture ,",
    "elms are likely suppressed if in an experimental h - mode scenario the edge profiles are sustained below a ballooning unstable critical gradient by rmp effects on the ( inter - elm ) turbulent transport .",
