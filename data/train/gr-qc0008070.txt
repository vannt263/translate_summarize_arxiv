    "to be more precise , if @xmath1 is the tangent space to a manifold at the point @xmath2 , then a holonomy transformation is a set of linear maps from @xmath1 into itself , induced by parallel transfer around closed paths based on @xmath2 .",
    "each such path defines an element of the holonomy group , determining the _ deficit angle _ between the initial and final positions of a vector after such parallel transport .",

    "+ apparently , the neglect of the schwarzschild - droste spacetime is for a simple reason : when asked whether a vector parallely transported in an ` equatorial ' orbit around a schwarzschild - droste ( sd ) black hole will manifest a deficit angle after completing a full circle , most relativists answer ,  no . \"",
    "the intuitive response evidently relies on one s sense of spherical symmetry ",
    "nothing changes during completion of the orbit  and on the fact that around the equator of an ordinary two - sphere the phase change is indeed zero . here , however , is a striking case where intuition fails .",
    "it is easy to show , as we do below , that parallel transport in a circular orbit around a sd black hole definitely results in a nonzero deficit angle  the vector has changed direction .",
    "the first and most important point to be made regarding holonomy in the sd geometry , therefore , is that nonzero holonomy exists and consequently provides a gravitational analog to the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "( strictly speaking , the aharonov- bohm effect takes place in a region where there is no electromagnetic field , whereas the sd spacetime certainly contains a gravitational field .",
    "a closer analogy would be an asymptotically flat , cylindrically symmetric space time , such as that produced by cosmic strings @xcite , which contains a conical singularity . )",
    "+ beginning with the simple calculation for circular orbits , we explore holonomy along a variety of paths in the sd geometry , for both geodesic and non geodesic motion .",
    "we find several surprising results .",
    "although a few of these are presented in @xcite , the majority are not and , in any case , none of them appear to be widely known .",

    "as mentioned , it is perhaps the zero result on the equator that helps to lead one s intuition astray and to predict that the same will hold for the sd geometry .",

    "this is as a direct result of the fact that , in a curved spacetime even if the system is prepared with the @xmath259-axes of the two particles aligned , this in no way guarantees that after propagation in a gravitational field their axes will remain aligned at the point of measurement .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that quantum correlation between the spins of epr particles in a gravitational field may be formulated with the aid of parallel transport . as such , some of the curves",
    "we have studied here may prove useful in a proper analysis of epr experiments in curved spaces . + it is also worth pointing out that in the holonomy band structure discussed in section [ circular ] we have an example of quantization that does not depend on planck s constant . can it be measured ?",
    "gyroscopes obey fermi - walker transport , in which the timelike vector of the local tetrad is is held parallel to the tangent vector of the curve . in this way",
    "there are no spatial rotations .",
    "along geodesics fermi - walker transport becomes parallel transport .",
    "nevertheless , given that the holonomy depends on @xmath260 for earth , the experiment does not seem terribly feasible ( witness the difficulties attending the stanford gyroscope experiment ) .",
    "however , in the geometric optics approximation , the polarization vector of light is parallel transported . in principle , then , one could measure polarization bands around black holes , where @xmath261 . in principle , one could also measure electron interference , since the electron spin axis is also parallel transported .",
    "+ the holonomy properties we have investigated may be more interesting in a quantum setting .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the holonomy map @xmath175 was originally introduced in gauge theories in the form @xmath262    in this equation the @xmath263 s represent gauge potentials and , in the case of electromagnetism , @xmath264 represents the dirac phase factor , the observable in the aharonov - bohm experiment . in the gravitational case , therefore , the @xmath178 s play the role of the @xmath263 .",
    "however , the analogy is not exact in the sense that the holonomy in gauge theories take place in the internal gauge space of the theory , whereas the  phase \" changes we have described in this paper take place in real spacetime .",
    "many authors @xcitehave also noticed the similarity between the holonomy map @xmath175 and the expression for the phase that appears in quantum - mechanical path integration : @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the classical action for a particle .    here",
    ", however , although the path integration does take place over space , the canonical position and momenta that figure in the action form operators in hilbert space , not in spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to ask whether the similarities among the three expressions are coincidental or whether one can truly regard quantum evolution as an example of parallel transport .",
    "specifically , what is the relation , if any , between parallel transport in spacetime and parallel transport in hilbert space ?",
    "a naive way of forcing the analogy between spacetime parallel transport and the path integral or dirac phase factor is to place an @xmath267 in the exponent of the holonomy map ( [ ucirc ] ) , which makes the connections imaginary .",
    "this is equivalent to performing an analytic continuation into imaginary time .",
    "one then finds that for the circular orbits the exponential and oscillatory solutions are reversed with oscillatory solutions in the region @xmath54 and exponential solutions for @xmath268 . the holonomy map ( [ ucirc ] ) for circular orbits remains the same , with hyperbolic functions replacing trignometric ones and @xmath269 replaced by @xmath41 . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the same result is obtained by considering the region @xmath270 , where the roles of space and time are reversed .",
    "we have not investigated the consequences of classical imaginary - time holonomy in detail , but it does not appear to mimic known quantum effects .",
    "+ the next natural thought for combining the spacetime and quantum descriptions is to consider a kaluza - klein model , in which the gauge and gravitational potentials are placed on an equal footing .",
    "however , when one does this and compactifies to four dimensions , one finds solutions similar to the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "that is , one merely gets another connection coefficient from the fifth dimension , which adds another term to the holonomy frequency @xmath41 , just as we found in the previous section .",
    "indeed , this does couple the electromagnetic potential to the holonomy through the charge , but not in a qualitatively new way ; it does not in any sense change a spacetime vector into a hilbert space vector .",
    "apparently a more sophisticated prescription is necessary to get qualitatively new behavior .",
    "those advanced so far by the above authors generally involve constructing hilbert bundles over spacetime ; however at present no particular formulation appears to be universally accepted .",
    "exploration of quantum parallel transport thus remains a promising territory for research .",
