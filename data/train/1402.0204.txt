    "the major difficulty in the seismic measurements of the solar internal structure comes from the uncertain effects of the outermost solar layers ( the photosphere and layers immediately below ) , where trapped acoustic waves are reflected to the solar interior .",
    "the difficulty originates from both the uncertainties in the theoretical modeling of these layers ( e. g. effects of the penetrative convection ) , and from poor understanding of the physics of wave propagation there ( non - adiabatic effects ) .",
    "this difficulty is behind the dominant source of mismatch between the observational and theoretical p - mode frequencies .",
    "the discrepancy increases with frequency ( as the upper turning points of the p modes move upwards ) , reaching values of the order of one percent at frequencies of maximum oscillation power ( about 3 mhz ) . in standards of solar seismology ,",
    "one percent is a huge quantity : the frequencies of solar oscillations are measured with precision better than one part in @xmath1 , and it is this high precision which enables the seismic data with its unique diagnostic capability .    to allow an accurate diagnostic of the deep interior ,",
    "the near - surface uncertainties are suppressed , in one way or another , by a proper design of helioseismic inversion technique .",
    "principally , the separation of the uncertain effects is made possible by the relatively small values of the sound speed in the subsurface layers , which makes the acoustic ray paths nearly vertical there , when the degree @xmath0 of the oscillations is not too high .",
    "the possibility of separating the uncertain effects is most transparent when high - frequency asymptotic analysis is implemented to describe the solar p modes : the subsurface effects bring a frequency - dependent phase shift @xmath2 of the standing acoustic wave , which does not depend on the degree @xmath0 when @xmath0 is small .",
    "separation of the near - surface uncertainties comes for a price of loosing valuable diagnostic information .",
    "an example is he ii ionization region , the domain which is particularly important for measuring the solar abundances and for the calibration of the equation of state . for p modes of low degree @xmath0 ,",
    "the signal of he ionization is also seen as a frequency - dependent `` surface phase shift '' ; this signal is suppressed together with near - surface uncertainties when an arbitrary function of frequency is allowed for @xmath2 . at higher degree @xmath0",
    ", we meet another difficulty . in high - precision measurements , the acoustic waves in the subsurface layers can no longer be considered as purely vertical , and at least a first - order correction shall be added to @xmath2 to account for the resulted dependence of the surface phase shift on the degree @xmath0 , as another function of frequency multiplied by @xmath3 @xcite . but",
    "according to the asymptotic description , allowing the degree dependence to the surface term widens the family of possible solutions in the deep interior @xcite .",
    "it is desirable , therefore , to extend the set of diagnostic tools , implemented in solar seismology for analyzing the oscillation frequencies , by adding new tools which respond differently to the near - surface uncertainties , and suppress these uncertainties in a different way .",
    "this will allow more options for the cross - validation of the results , to make them more reliable .",
    "an issue of particular importance is possible effects of systematic errors in frequency measurements ; these errors may be significantly bigger than the reported observational uncertainties ( see e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* which we refer below as paper i ) .",
    "in general , systematic errors propagate differently to the results when different techniques of data analysis are implemented , and using different tools brings better chances to detect these errors .    in this paper , we consider solar oscillations of intermediate and high degree @xmath0 as surface waves , and address the diagnostic properties of group velocities of these waves .",
    "the concept of group velocity is known to be a valuable tool in terrestrial seismology , where it is applied to study the propagation of love s and rayleigh s waves ( see e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "section 2 contains a general discussion , based on the integral representation of the group velocity in terms of adiabatic eigenfunctions of normal modes , developed in the appendix . in section 3",
    ", we test the diagnostic potential of group velocities by addressing the agreement of several solar models with observational data . in section 4",
    ", we implement the group - velocity analysis to the calibration of the main parameters of the solar convective envelope : specific entropy in the adiabatically - stratified layers , helium abundance @xmath4 and heavy - element abundance @xmath5 .",
    "section 5 contains a short discussion .",
    "with temporal dependence separated as @xmath6 , the displacement field of the oscillations specified by a particular spherical harmonic is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is horizontal component of the gradient operator , @xmath9 , and unit vectors are designated by hats .",
    "the horizontal wavenumber at the photospheric level is @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . the horizontal phase velocity @xmath12 and group velocity @xmath13 are @xmath14 where the derivative is taken at constant radial order @xmath15 .    using self - adjoint properties of the equations of linear adiabatic oscillations , it is shown in the appendix that @xmath16 where @xmath17 describes the eulirean perturbation @xmath18 to the gravitational potential as @xmath19 at high degree @xmath0 , the effects of gravity perturbation are small , and the second term in the nominator of the equation ( 3 ) can be neglected .",
    "the first term in the nominator is proportional to the mean kinetic energy of the horizontal motions ; the denominator is proportional to the total kinetic energy . when the effects of gravity perturbations are small , the ratio @xmath20 is thus the ratio of the horizontal kinetic energy to the total kinetic energy .",
    "an important property of the group velocity ( when compared with phase velocity ) is its enhanced sensitivity to the stratification of the inner part of the acoustic cavity , where the horizontal kinetic energy is localized ( fig .",
    "closer to the surface , the acoustic ray paths become nearly vertical , and the kinetic energy is dominated by the vertical motion",
    ".     mode of @xmath21 .",
    "the energy per unit depth in the integrals in equation ( 3 ) was multiplied with adiabatic sound speed @xmath22 to account for the rescaling of the independent variable from geometrical to acoustic radius . ]",
    "the concept of group velocity is not restricted to high - degree modes ; it extends formally to all the non - radial modes when we consider the degree @xmath0 as a continuous parameter .",
    "the ratio @xmath20 in the degree range @xmath23 , calculated for the reference solar model s of @xcite , is shown in fig.2 .     and frequency range 1mhz@xmath245mhz .",
    "red circles show modes with frequencies below 2mhz , green  between 2 and 3mhz , and blue  above 3mhz .",
    "upper scale is the position of the inner turning point in radius . ]    for modes penetrating deep into the solar interior , the ratio @xmath20 tends to collapse to a single function of the penetration depth ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the behaviour which reflects the high - frequency asymptotic properties of solar p modes .",
    "the rapid variation seen at @xmath25 comes from the rapid change in the sound - speed gradient at the base of the convection zone .",
    "the prominent fluctuations in @xmath26 exhibited by modes with turning points closer to the surface are produced by the rapid variation of the adiabatic exponent in the he ionization region .    for f modes ,",
    "the ratio @xmath20 is close to 1/2 , which reflects equipartition of the kinetic energy between horizontal and vertical motions . indeed , using an approximate dispersion relation of high - degree solar f modes as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is surface gravity , we have @xmath29 .",
    "introducing the derivative @xmath30 , we extend the family of solutions to the oscillation equations from integer to continuous values of degree @xmath0 .",
    "this extension can be achieved simply by allowing @xmath0 to take arbitrary values in the ordinary differential equations resulted from variable separation ; it can be viewed as a result of relaxing the periodic boundary conditions in angular coordinates .",
    "we now proceed with similar generalization but allowing non - integer values to the radial order @xmath15 .",
    "this is equivalent to allowing a continuous variation to the radial phase integral , which takes values of @xmath31 at resonant frequencies .",
    "the only limitation here is that the phase has a well - defined measure only for functions with nearly - harmonic behaviour .",
    "such a behaviour is exhibited by the solutions to the oscillation equations in the adiabatically - stratified part of the solar convective envelope , owing to their high - frequency asymptotic properties ( the wave propagation here is close to that of purely acoustic waves ) .",
    "specifically , the near - harmonic behavior is exhibited with best accuracy by eigenfunction @xmath32 defined as ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper i ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 describes the eulerian pressure perturbations @xmath35 as @xmath36 @xmath37 ( this parameter specifies the radial position @xmath38 of the inner turning points ) , and independent variable @xmath39 satisfies @xmath40 two linearly - independent solutions to the oscillation equations in cowling approximation ( which is applicable in the low - density envelope ) are @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ".    using variational principle for evaluating the variation with frequency of phases of the inner and of the outer solutions ( which satisfy inner and outer boundary conditions , respectively ) at a boundary taken in the domain where asymptotic description is applicable , we obtain ( see appendix ) @xmath43 in analogy with @xmath30 , considered as an angular component of the group velocity , @xmath44 can be considered as a mean group velocity in radial direction .    the dependence of both the @xmath30 and @xmath44 on the near - surface uncertainties comes principally from the dependence on these uncertainties of the denominator in the expressions ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) , which is the same ( mode s kinetic energy ) .",
    "this observation suggests using the ratio @xmath45 as diagnostic quantity , which will allow to suppress the effects of the near - surface uncertainties . in the simplest way",
    ", this quantity can be evaluated from the mode frequencies using central differences as @xmath46 according to the equation ( 9 ) , the inverse of @xmath44 can be considered as `` mode mass '' .",
    "the difference with traditional definition of the mode mass ( mode energy at unit surface amplitude ) is that the surface amplitude is replaced by the amplitude in the propagation domain .",
    "the principal advantage is that with this definition , the `` mode mass '' becomes an observable quantity .",
    "the diagnostic properties of @xmath47 defined by the equation ( 10 ) can be seen better if we extend the comparison with high - frequency asymptotic analysis somewhat further . in the leading - order approximation ,",
    "the asymptotic eigenfrequency equation is @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 the left - hand side of the equation ( 12 ) is the radial phase integral @xmath50 of a purely acoustic wave , @xmath2 is the frequency - dependent `` surface phase shift '' .",
    "the sound - speed profile @xmath22 can be recovered from @xmath51 using abel s integral transform applied to the equation ( 13 ) .",
    "differentiating both sides of the equation ( 12 ) in frequency @xmath52 , first at @xmath53=const , then at @xmath15=const , and subtracting the results , we have @xmath54 and we see that the influence of the unknown behaviour of @xmath2 on the results of the sound - speed inversion is successfully eliminated . comparing the equations ( 10 ) and ( 14 ) , we see that @xmath47 is expected to be largely insensitive to the near - surface uncertainties .",
    "in this section , we test the ability of group - velocity measurements to reveal inconsistencies between the solar models and the observational data . in these tests ,",
    "we compare the @xmath55-values measured from the solar oscillation frequencies with those obtained from the eigenfrequencies of solar models .",
    "3(a ) shows the difference in @xmath55 between the sun and the reference model s of @xcite .",
    "the observational frequencies were obtained by averaging the results of 15 years of soho mdi measurements ( this observational data set is discussed in more detail in paper i , where it is designated as data set 1 ) .",
    "a prominent mismatch is seen in the group - velocity data for waves with turning points just below the convective envelope , which indicates an inadequate description of the seismic stratification in the solar tachocline .     and those of the reference model s. ( b ) same residuals but obtained with interpolated values of @xmath55 ( see text ) ( c ) as ( b ) , but after a slowly - varying function of frequency was subtracted from the residuals .",
    "red circles show the results obtained at frequencies below 2 mhz , green circles  between 2 and 3 mhz , and blue circles  with data above 3 mhz . ]    for waves confined in the convective envelope , the mismatch is moderately small at low frequencies ( below 2 mhz ) , but grows significantly when frequency increases .",
    "this behaviour is induced by the systematic difference between observational and theoretical frequencies , which grows when frequency increases . as a result",
    ", the @xmath55-values evaluated with using the equation ( 11 ) from observational and theoretical frequencies correspond to surface waves with different penetration depth .",
    "a simple way to reduce this effect is to replace the theoretical values of @xmath55 with values obtained by the interpolation along the p - mode ridge to proper values of @xmath56 ( defined by equation 6 ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) ; as expected , the residuals now fall much closer to a single function of the penetration depth .",
    "small , but systematic fluctuations around the common trend remain in the residuals even after the interpolation .",
    "these are due to the fact that that the observational and theoretical values of @xmath57 , reduced to the same penetration depth , are still measured at different frequencies ( as a result , the phase of the wave function in the he ii ionization region is distorted ) .",
    "we can make the signal which brings information about inconsistencies in deep interior cleaner still by subtracting a common function of frequency : the result is shown in fig .",

    "we processed these frequencies in the same way as discussed above , to test the new model against the solar data .",
