    "a real lie algebra can be easily complexified by tensoring it with the complex numbers over the reals , and extending the lie bracket bilinearly . complexifying a lie group",
    "is a much more subtle problem , for which a solution does not always exist .",
    "all compact lie groups admit a complexification , but the proof of that is not trivial ( see for example @xcite ,  106 ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a khler manifold , and let @xmath1 denote the group of hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of @xmath3 , with lie algebra @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath1 is known to be  morally \" an infinite - dimensional analogue of a compact group , and one can wonder whether it has a complexification .",
    "( one can rigorously prove that @xmath1 is a diffeological lie group , @xcite . ) from a physical point of view this would correspond to finding a sensible way to associate a dynamical system to a complex - valued hamiltonian , @xmath5 , in a manner that extends the notion of hamilton flow in case @xmath6 is real - valued .",
    "this issue was raised and taken on by donaldson in a series of papers beginning with @xcite , @xcite , in connection with a set of lovely problems in khler geometry , and has generated a lot of research . from this point of view ,",
    "the interest in finding a complexification of _ ham _ is based on the fact , discovered independently by atiyah and guillemin and sternberg , that if a compact lie group acts in a hamiltonian fashion on a khler manifold then the the action extends to the complexified group in an interesting way that can be understood .",
    "donaldson pointed out that _ ham _ acts on the infinite - dimensional space of khler potentials of @xmath7 , and the moment map is a hermitian scalar curvature .",
    "the appeal of extending the finite - dimensional picture to this infinite - dimensional setting of khler metrics is that it was hoped to lead to a way of constructing extremal metrics . in this note",
    "we will not enter into the connections with khler geometry , other than to point out here that exponentiating purely - imaginary hamiltonians leads to geodesics in the space of khler potentials .",
    "we will explore this in an expanded version of this note .",
    "our focus is on the following issue : donaldson has put forward a notion of  formal lie group \" to conceptualize his notion of a formal complexification of _",
    "ham_. briefly , a formal lie group with lie algebra @xmath8 is a  manifold \" ( the notion is of interest only in infinite dimensions ) , @xmath9 , together with a trivialization of its tangent bundle of the form @xmath10 , such that the map @xmath11corresponding vector field @xmath12 on @xmath9 is a lie algebra homomorphism ( with respect to the commutator of vector fields ) .",
    "the vector fields @xmath12 should be thought of as  left- invariant \" , though no group structure on @xmath9 exists .",
    "( again this definition can be made completely rigorous in the language of diffeologies , @xcite . )    in the present case @xmath13 and the exponential map in our title refers to the problem of constructing the flow of the fields @xmath12 .",
    "corollary [ cormain ] states that the family of diffeomorhpisms @xmath14 there exponentiate the complex - valued hamiltonian @xmath6 , in one of donaldson s models for the complexification of @xmath9 ( see @xcite  4 ) .",
    "our construction is based on the following existence result :    let @xmath15 be a real analytic khler manifold of real dimension @xmath16 .",
    "there exists a holomorphic complex symplectic manifold @xmath17 of complex dimension @xmath16 and an inclusion @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , and with the following additional structure :    1 .",
    "an anti - holomorphic involution @xmath20 whose fixed point set is the image of @xmath21 and such that @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   a holomorphic projection @xmath23 , @xmath24 , whose fibers are holomorphic lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "the local existence is simple : we take @xmath25 to be a neighborhood of the diagonal in @xmath26 , with the complex structure @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the holomorphic extension of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the projection is simply @xmath31 .",
    "however there exist natural complexifications that make our results below much more global in some cases .",
    "for example , if @xmath32 is a generic coadjoint orbit of a compact simply connected lie group @xmath33 ( one through the interior of a weyl chamber ) , then one can take for @xmath25 the orbit of the complexification , @xmath34 , of @xmath33 through the same element .",
    "if we let @xmath35 be the iwasawa decomposition of @xmath34 , then the orbits of the action of @xmath36 on @xmath25 are the fibers of a holomorphic projection @xmath37 .",
    "( this picture extends to non - generic orbits . )    to describe our results we need some notation . given a function @xmath5 whose real and imaginary parts are real analytic",
    ", there is a holomorphic extension @xmath38 perhaps only defined near @xmath39 , but we will not make a notational distinction between @xmath25 and such a neighborhood , as our results are local in time .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath40 be as above .",
    "the fibers of @xmath41 are the leaves of a holomorphic foliation , @xmath42 , of @xmath25 .",
    "denote by @xmath43 the hamilton flow of @xmath44 ( where @xmath44 is the real part of @xmath40 ) with respect to the real part of @xmath28 .",
    "we denote by @xmath45 the image of the foliation @xmath42 under @xmath46 ( so that @xmath47 ) we assume that there exists @xmath48 an open interval containing the origin such that @xmath49 the leaves of @xmath45 are the fibers of a projection @xmath50 .",
    "we will denote @xmath51 the fiber of @xmath45 over @xmath52 .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath48 be an open set as above .",
    "let @xmath53 be defined by @xmath54 then , @xmath49 :    1 .",
    "there is a complex structure @xmath55 such that @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 ) .",
    "@xmath58 is holomorphic ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the infinitesimal generator of @xmath60 is @xmath61 where @xmath62 , denotes the hamilton vector field of @xmath63 with respect to @xmath29 , etc .",
    "[ ck ] conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ( together with the initial condition @xmath64 ) characterize the family @xmath65 .",
    "it is in fact not hard to see that in local real - analytic coordinates @xmath66 on @xmath32 , these conditions show that the family solves a system of first - order non - linear pdes of the form @xmath67 with @xmath68 and where the @xmath69 are real - analytic .",
    "therefore local existence and uniqueness follow from the cauchy - kowalewsky theorem .",
    "suppose @xmath34 is a compact lie group acting on @xmath32 in a hamiltonian fashion and preserving @xmath70 .",
    "then the action extends to a holomorphic action to the complexification @xmath71 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ,  4 ) .",
    "the extended action is as follows : if @xmath72 are two components of the moment map of the @xmath34 action , then the infinitesimal action corresponding to @xmath73 is the vector field @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms , @xmath75 , satisfies ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of theorem [ main ] , with @xmath76 for all @xmath77 . by the uniqueness part of the previous remark we must have @xmath78 .",
    "in other words , our construction is an extension of the process of complexifying the action of a compact group of symmetries of @xmath0 .",
    "we now explain the geometry behind the construction of @xmath60 summarized by ( [ lapapa ] ) . to find the image of @xmath79 under @xmath60 one flows the leaf @xmath80 of the foliation @xmath81 by @xmath46 , and intersects the image leaf with @xmath32 . in other words , ( [ lapapa ] )",
    "can be stated equivalently as : @xmath82 the definition of @xmath83 is summarized in the following figure , where @xmath84 :        in this figure @xmath32 is represented by the horizontal segment . under @xmath46",
    "the fibers of the foliation @xmath85 are transformed into the fibers of @xmath45 , and @xmath86 .",
    "as we will see the following is an easy consequence of the previous result :    [ cormain ] let @xmath87 and @xmath88 the symplectic form defined by @xmath89 .",
    "then @xmath90 where @xmath91 , denotes the hamilton vector field of @xmath63 with respect to @xmath88 , etc .",
    "it is not hard to check that @xmath92 , therefore in the ( relatively rare ) cases when @xmath60 is a one - parameter subgroup of diffeomorphisms one has @xmath93 .",
    "the present construction is motivated by semiclassical analysis . ignoring ( possibly catastrophic ) domain issues , the notion of the exponential of a non - hermitian _ quantum _ hamiltonian is clear .",
    "( for example , if @xmath32 is compact and planck s constant is fixed , this amounts to exponentiating a matrix . )",
    "therefore a very natural approach to exponentiating a non - hermitian classical hamiltonian is to first quantize it , exponentiate it on the quantum side , and then take the semiclassical limit .",
    "this approach has been developed by rubinstein and zelditch , @xcite , and raises a number of interesting but difficult analytical questions . in our construction",
    "we bypass these analytic difficulties by considering the following geometric remnants of quantization : each leaf of the foliation @xmath85 corresponds to a quantum state ( element of the projectivization of the quantum hilbert space ) represented by a _ coherent state _ centered at a point on the leaf , that is , an element in the hilbert space that semiclassically concentrates at the intersection of the leaf with @xmath32 .",
    "the fact that @xmath41 is holomorphic says the the coherent states are associated to the metric of @xmath94 . on the quantum side",
    "the evolution of a coherent state remains a coherent state , whose lagrangian is simply the image of the one at time @xmath95 by the complexified classical flow . as explained above our maps @xmath65",
    "simply follow the evolution of the real center .",
    "finally , we mention that the paper @xcite by graefe and schubert contains a very clear and detailed account of the case when @xmath32 is equal to @xmath96 , @xmath6 is a quadratic complex hamiltonian , and the lagrangian foliations are by complex - linear positive subspaces , corresponding to standard gaussian coherent states with possibly complex centers . by explicit calculations on both quantum and classical sides , they show that the the evolution of a coherent state centered at @xmath52 is another coherent state whose center may be complex , but that represents the same quantum state as a suitable gaussian coherent state centered at @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath98 denote the infinitesimal generator of @xmath46 .",
    "the following is easy to check in a local trivialization of the foliation of @xmath25 by fibers of @xmath99 :      introduce coordinates @xmath105 in a neighborhood @xmath106 centered at @xmath107 so that @xmath108 is defined by @xmath109 and the projection @xmath99 is just @xmath110",
    ". note that , since @xmath102 is a one - parameter local subgroup of diffeomorphisms , for @xmath111 small @xmath112 for @xmath111 near zero denote the map @xmath113 in coordinates by @xmath114 ( in a smaller neighborhood of @xmath107 ) . for each @xmath111",
    "the image of the @xmath115-axis under @xmath113 locally parametrize the fiber @xmath116 , namely @xmath117 therefore we can write @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is defined implicitly by @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it follows that @xmath122 however @xmath123 is the identity , so that @xmath124 and therefore @xmath125 .    to proceed",
    "further we will need some notation .",
    "we regard @xmath25 as a real manifold of real dimension @xmath126 with an integrable complex structure @xmath127 .",
    "let us write @xmath128 for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath28 .",
    "thus the @xmath129 are real symplectic forms on @xmath25 and @xmath32 is @xmath130-symplectic and @xmath131-lagrangian .",
    "let us write @xmath132 for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath40 .",
    "recall that , by definition , @xmath98 is the hamilton field of @xmath133 with respect to @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath6 is real then @xmath142 ( by uniqueness of analytic continuation of @xmath6 ) , so @xmath44 is @xmath143-invariant . since @xmath22 , @xmath130 is also @xmath143-invariant , and therefore @xmath143 maps @xmath98 to itself and so @xmath98 has to be tangent to the fixed - point set of @xmath143 .",
    "for the second part just note that @xmath144 .",
    "\\(1 ) since the fibers of @xmath99 are the leaves of a holomorphic foliation , there is a well - defined complex structure in the abstract normal bundle to the fibers .",
    "the inclusion @xmath18 realizes @xmath32 as a cross - section to the foliation and identifies @xmath145 with the normal bundle to the foliation along @xmath32 .",
    "therefore it inherits a complex structure that makes @xmath99 holomorphic .",
    "\\(2 ) this follows from the interpretation of the structures @xmath146 as arising from the normal bundle structures together with the fact that @xmath46 is holomorphic , or can be checked directly as follows .",
    "let @xmath147 , then @xmath148 , where @xmath149 . since @xmath150 is holomorphic",
    ", one has @xmath151 but @xmath152 since @xmath46 maps fibers of @xmath85 to fibers of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the previous relation implies that @xmath153 which precisely says that @xmath60 is holomorphic .        by the previous lemma ,",
    "if @xmath6 is real , @xmath158 and there is nothing more to prove .",
    "suppose now that @xmath6 is purely imaginary .",
    "by the second relation in ( [ hamfi ] ) , @xmath159 is the hamilton field of @xmath160 ( see [ re+iim ] ) , and by the lemma [ realcase ] @xmath159 is tangent to @xmath25 and its restriction to @xmath25 is the hamilton field of @xmath161 with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "therefore in this case we can write @xmath162 and it suffices to apply @xmath70 to both sides to get the result .",
    "the general case follows by @xmath163-linearity of the composition @xmath164 , where the first arrow is analytic continuation .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "_ proof of corollary [ cormain]_. recalling that @xmath92 , so we wish to compute @xmath165 .",
