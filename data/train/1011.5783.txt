    "we briefly present here additional tests to assess the reliability of the results against a few numerical effects that might play a role in the computation of the average azimuthal scatter .",
    "first , we show the additional results for the profiles and the azimuthal scatter for the the two most massive clusters of the gadget2 runs ( g1a and g8a ) , in re - simulations where cooling , star formation and feedback from galactic winds where self - consistently followed during the run .",
    "the star formation is followed by adopting a sub - resolution multiphase model for the interstellar medium , including also the feedback from supernovae and galactic outflows ( springel & hernquist 2003 ) . in these runs ,",
    "the efficiency of supernovae to power galactic winds has been set to 50 per cent , which turns into a wind speed of @xmath23 .",
    "these re - simulations have been extracted from the same `` _ cfs _ '' dataset of roncarelli et al.(2006 ) . in the top panel of fig.[fig : appendix ] we show the average gas density ( top lines ) and gas entropy ( bottom lines ) profiles for g1a and g8a at z=0 , after the `` 99 percent '' filtering procedure ( sec.[subsec : method ] ) , for the reference physical run adopted in the main article ( solid lines ) and for the _ csf _ model ( dashed ) . except for the sizable increase of the core gas density and the decrease of the core gas entropy , as an obvious effect of radiative cooling",
    ", the agreement for all the radii outside @xmath24 is remarkable .",
    "this is in line with the early results already reported by roncarelli et al.(2006 ) and romeo et al.(2006 ) .    in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : appendix ] we show the corresponding radial trend of the azimuthal scatter as defined in eq.[eq : scatter ] and keeping @xmath25 sectors ( the bold lines refer to gas density and the thin lines refer to gas entropy ) .",
    "for both clusters in this case the differences in the azimuthal scatter are sizable when the two physical runs are compared ( @xmath0 per cent at all radii ) ; however all profiles scatter around the value of @xmath26 at all radii from @xmath27 , with no evident trend with radius . this may be well explained by the small scale effect of cooling sub - clumps at all radii in the _ csf _ run : the `` 99 per cent filtering '' procedure outlined in the main paper efficiently removes the pointlike contribution from these clumps , however cooling make them more compact and enhances their survival within the cluster atmosphere and their efficiency in injecting shocks and small scale disturbances in the icm ( e.g. valdarnini 2010 ) , which can slightly change the local scatter behaviour , even if not the overall trend of azimuthal scatter in the clusters .",
    "these results make us confident that the adoption of more complex physical modeling compared to the non - radiative runs investigated in the main paper can not change our conclusion in any sizable way , for all the cluster volume outside of cores .    in a second test",
    ", we checked the stability of our results against the adoption of a larger line of sight across the projected cylinder , increasing its size from @xmath28 ( as used in the main paper ) to @xmath29 .",
    "this was motivated by the fact that the overlap of not virialized regions and large scale environment along the line of sight towards the cluster may vary the reported values of the azimuthal scatter .",
    "we thus re - computed the azimuthal scatter of gas density , gas temperature and gas entropy for cluster g1a of the gadget2 sample , by considering a line of sight of @xmath30 ( fig.[fig : appendix2 ] ) .",
    "the test clearly shows that the difference in the azimuthal scatter of all quantities remains essentially the same within a few percent , with all trends un - altered .",
    "we thus conclude that our results are well constrained for a total line of sight of @xmath31 .     sectors .",
