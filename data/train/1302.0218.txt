    "spectacular diffuse radio sources , with very low surface brightness and @xmath0mpc extent , are observed in some of the most massive galaxy clusters .",
    "depending on their location , i.e. , cluster center versus outskirts , these cluster - wide sources are classified as giant radio halos or relics .",
    "halos and relics are due to synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic electrons with energy of several gev , spinning in @xmath5 g magnetic fields that permeate the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification during cluster mergers have been proposed as mechanisms by which diffuse radio emission is generated in clusters . in particular ,",
    "relics should be produced by electron ( re)acceleration at merger shocks , while giant halos may be caused by reacceleration of lower energy relativistic electrons by mhd turbulence during mergers ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "although alternative possibilities have been proposed for the origin of the radio - emitting electrons  the secondary models ",
    "turbulent reacceleration models seem to be favored by current radio observations .",
    "in particular , radio halos with very steep spectral index , where @xmath6 is the is the flux density at the frequency @xmath7 . ] ( @xmath8 ) have been found ( the prototype case is a521 with @xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with turbulent reacceleration in weak mergers , i.e. , collisions between clusters with relatively low mass ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 ) or accretion of smaller systems into a massive cluster .",
    "secondary models have difficulty explaining such ultra - steep spectrum radio halos ( ussrhs ) , due to the large energy required in the form of relativistic protons .",
    "however , only two giant radio halos are confirmed ussrhs so far  a521 and a697  based on a well - constrained spectrum with five data points between 150 mhz and 1.4 ghz ( macario et al .",

    "ussrhs still lack confirmation of their spectral index ( e.g. , giacintucci et al .",

    "therefore , it is necessary to confirm the candidates and find more of these ussrhs , with an accurate determination of their spectral index , before ruling out the secondary models .    a number of dedicated searches for cluster diffuse radio sources have been carried out in the past decade , and the number of giant halos and relics has rapidly increased . while @xmath050 objects are presently known ( including candidates ) , because of their low surface brightness , most of them lack detailed spectral information , crucial to test theoretical models and understand the origin of the radio - emitting electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , large uncertainties affect our measurement . in particular , it is possible that some of the halo flux density is missed in both the reprocessed nvss image and the gmrt 235 mhz image due to the short duration of the observations , which results in sparse coverages of the @xmath47 plane and loss of sensitivity to structure .",
    "furthermore , the low resolution of the 1.4 ghz image does not allow an accurate removal of the discrete radio galaxies in the halo region , and , consequently , the halo flux density could be overestimated .",
    "a flux density of @xmath04550 mjy is measured from low - resolution ( @xmath72 ) images at 610 mhz ( not shown here ) , obtained after the subtraction of the discrete sources .",

    "a filtered event list is created by removing periods of excessive count rate in the light curve caused by proton flaring events ( retaining 13.7 ks , 13.4 ks , and 8.2 ks of the exposures for the mos1 , mos2 , and pn data , respectively ) , excluding anomalous mos ccds ( in this case ccds 4 , 5 , and 6 for mos1 ) , and identifying and excluding point sources .",
    "spectra and images are then extracted , including for the quiescent particle background , which is derived from a database of filter wheel closed observations that are matched to data from the unexposed corners of the chips .",
    "the remaining background components ( residual soft proton contamination , instrumental lines , solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) emission , and the cosmic fore- and backgrounds from the local hot bubble , the galaxy , and extragalactic unresolved point sources ) are all explicitly modeled and determined empirically when fitting spectra in xspec .",
    "while robust best fits of these components can be trickier to obtain in shorter exposures such as this one , the smaller angular extent of this cluster provides for a large local background region from which their parameters can be sufficiently constrained .    in this case , nearly all of the cluster emission is taken to fall within a circle of @xmath75 radius ; epic mos and pn spectra from this region and the remaining field of view out to @xmath76 ( containing only background ) are simultaneously fit .",
    "we find a global cluster temperature of @xmath77 kev , in good agreement with that reported in planck collaboration et al .",
    "( 2011c ) of @xmath78 kev .",
    "our slightly lower temperature likely reflects a different source region and background treatment , and our greater uncertainty is a consequence of treating background components as free parameters .",
    "for the image analysis , the best - fit values for the non - cosmic backgrounds ( quiescent particle , soft proton , and swcx ) are translated into images and subtracted from the data .",

    "structurally , the central region is elongated in the north  west / south  east direction with the x - ray peak slightly towards the se side from the large - scale emission centroid . the radio halo and x - ray surface brightness generally follow each other , as often observed in clusters hosting radio halos .",
    "the asymmetric icm morphology is consistent with a recent merger event .    to investigate the merger state in more detail , we constructed a temperature map using smoothed narrow - band images fitted with the mekal plasma model , using a method described in @xcite .",
    "images are extracted in seven bands ( 0.4 - 0.8 kev , 0.8 - 1.1 kev , 1.1 - 1.35 kev , 1.9 - 2.1 kev , 2.35 - 3.2 kev , 3.2 - 4.8 kev , and 4.8 - 7.2 kev ) that avoid instrumental lines .",
    "a local background , accounting for galactic and extragalactic non - cluster sources , is estimated from the region outside the cluster in each image and subtracted , after which the image is corrected by vignetting and exposure maps . using the esas task comb , which adjusts each exposure map to the response of the mos2 , medium filter response ,",

    "then , an absorbed mekal model with fixed absorption ( @xmath81 @xmath82 ) , abundance ( 0.3 solar ) , and redshift ( 0.27 ) is fit to the coarse spectrum in the seven energy bins corresponding to each pixel .",
    "the resulting best - fit temperatures are shown in figure 5b , which have 1-sigma errors on the order of 1 kev in the center and @xmath83 kev near the edge .",

    "the bimodality evident in this diagram ( with some clusters lacking diffuse radio emission , while those that exhibit radio halos follow a correlation ) is one of the main outcomes of the gmrt radio - halo survey and provides quantitative support to reacceleration models for the origin of radio halos ( brunetti et al .",

    "thus , the radio halo in plck171 provides further support to the existence of a direct link between the radio halo phenomenon and cluster mergers .    a scaling relation between the radio power at 1.4 ghz and the integrated sz effect measurement ( y ) has been recently presented by basu ( 2012 ) .",

    "however , deeper multi - frequency observations are required before any definitive interpretation of the spectral index of this radio halo .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the cluster and radio power of the halo at 1.4 ghz are consistent with the correlation known to be followed by radio - halo clusters .",
    "its location in the @xmath99-@xmath92 plane also follows the scaling relation found for clusters with radio halos .",
    "the asymmetries observed in the x - ray surface brightness and temperaure distributions , derived from the _ xmm _ data , indicate a disturbed icm resulting from a recent merger .",
    "this is in line with the expectation that giant radio halos are exclusively associated with cluster mergers .    with an x - ray luminosity of 1.13@xmath100 erg s@xmath2 and a redshift of @xmath17",
    ", plck171 represents the kind of clusters that have been missed in x - ray flux limited surveys , such as the rosat all sky survey , and , consequently , in radio surveys based on x - ray selection criteria , such as the gmrt radio - halo survey ( venturi et al .",
