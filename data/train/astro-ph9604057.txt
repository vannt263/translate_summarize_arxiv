    "one of the outstanding achievements of the compton imaging telescope ( comptel ) aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ has been the first sky map in the light of the 1.809  line which is attributed to radioactive decay of 26  ( @xmath5 yr ) .",
    "the observed emission is clearly of galactic origin since it is concentrated on the galactic plane .",
    "its distribution along the plane is strikingly lumpy with extended emission features and ` hot - spots ' ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of these features , situated in the vela region , is of particular interest ( diehl  1995b ) .",
    "a recent survey of candidate 26  sources ( core collapse supernovae ( sne ) , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , asymptotic giant - branch ( agb ) stars , and o - ne - mg novae ) in this region of the sky by oberlack  ( 1994 ) identified the vela supernova remnant ( snr ) as most likely source of the emission if its progenitor star was massive ( @xmath6 ) and its distance is @xmath7 pc .",
    "the distance constraint is in line with recent x - ray based distance estimates of 350 , 400 - 600 , and 125 - 160 pc ( aschenbach 1993 , aschenbach et al .",
    "1995 , becker 1995 ) , respectively , all pointing towards distances below the canonical 500 pc .",
    "these findings raise the question if there are other snrs detectable by comptel as 26  sources . from the 1.8  line sensitivity of @xmath8 ( for an observation of @xmath9 seconds ) and an optimistic 26  supernova yield of @xmath10  for type ii sne ( hoffman  1995 ) we estimate that sne could be detectable by comptel up to distances of @xmath11 pc . in this paper",
    "we report on our attempt to identify probable candidate snrs and on the search for their 1.809  line emission .",
    "while snrs are assumed to be produced by all types of sne , only core collapse events ( type ii and ib ) are expected to release significant amounts of 26  ( leising 1994 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no certain , direct way to determine which of the galactic snrs are associated with core collapse events . for the historical sne , knowledge of the light curve sheds some light on their type , but the identification is not unambigous ( doggett & branch 1985 ) .",
    "the presence of a neutron star within a snr would identify it as core collapse remnant , but there are only 10 known galactic snr - pulsar associations ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of them except the vela snr , however , are at distances greater than 1.8 kpc , much too far to be detectable by comptel ( see above ) .",
    "recently , evidence is growing that oxygen - rich and plerionic - composite snrs may come from type ib and type ii sne respectively ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , most of the galactic snrs do nt fall in these classes .",
    "the key element in our candidate source selection is the distance of the remnant . of the 194 snrs known in our galaxy ( @xcite ) ,",
    "only 23 have good or reasonable distance estimates ( @xcite ) . from those ,",
    "only the vela snr is close enough to be detectable by comptel . for the other snrs , only rough or no distance estimates are available which makes the direct determination of the nearest 26  source candidates unfeasible",
    "therefore , we used the empirical radio surface brightness - diameter relation (  relation ) to identify the closest snrs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "green ( 1984 , 1991 ) pointed out that the  relation can not provide accurate distances to individual snrs , but berkhuijsen ( 1986 ) showed that it sets reliable upper distance limits : using @xmath12 ( @xcite ) , none from 23 snrs are found in the region where the distance measurement contradicts those upper limits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : indicator ] , grey - shaded area ) .",
    "( 8.8,6 ) ( 8.8,6 )      using berkhuijsen s ( 1986 )  relation as distance indicator , we selected four snrs as possible candidates for nearby 26  sources : the cygnus loop , the monoceros nebula , the lupus loop and hb 21 . selecting",
    "the snrs with the lowest distance limits obviously chooses nearby objects , but not necessarily all of them .",
    "there could be nearby snrs which are not extended or not very powerful and therefore have large distance limits .",
    "none of the selected remnants is in green s ( 1984 , 1991 ) lists of good or reasonable distance determinations , but crude estimates are available for all of them .",
    "we compiled the relevant properties of the four candidates in table [ tb : snrs ] along with those of the vela snr .",
    "the cygnus loop and hb 21 were probably created by core collapse events .",
    "x - ray observations with einstein provide evidence for cavities devoided of clouds prior to the explosions , probably created by the stellar winds of the progenitor stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since strong stellar winds are only expected for massive stars , the sne must have been of type ii or ib .",
    "also the monoceros nebula was probably created by a core collapse event .",
    "odegard ( 1986 ) summarizes observational evidence which indicates that the monoceros nebula is associated with the mon ob2 stellar association and the rosette nebula . since low - mass stars",
    "are generally not very evolved in ob associations , the occurence of type ia sne is rather improbable . hence if a snr is located in an ob associations it is likely that it arose from the explosion of a massive star .",
    "we found no indication of sn type for the lupus loop in the literature .",
    "however , the ( fairly uncertain ) distance estimate of 1.2 kpc ( @xcite ) and its high galactic latitude of @xmath13=15.97  places it 330 pc above the galactic plane .",
    "this height is more typical for the old stellar population than for young massive objects which would favour the relation of the snr to a type ia event .",
    "nevertheless , we included this object in our 1.8  emission search .",

    "a data - space enclosing @xmath36 around the snr position was employed .",
    "the data - space distribution of instrumental background was derived from measurements at adjacent energy bands ( @xcite ) .",
    "the search for 1.8  emission was carried out by convolving models of the snrs into the data - space which were fitted along with the background model to the data . the maximum - likelihood technique ( @xcite )",
    "was applied to determine flux , flux error , and detection significance for all models .",
    "upper limits of 1.8  emission were determined by variation of the snr source flux to obtain a likelihood - ratio corresponding to @xmath34 limits above the best - fit ( or above zero flux in cases where the best fit gave a negative source flux ) .",
    "since it is not clear how the 26  is distributed within the snrs , we tested two extreme hypotheses for each candidate : ( 1 ) all 26  is confined to the center of the remnant ( point source hypothesis ) , and ( 2 ) the 26  is distributed homogeneous over the snr ( extended source hypothesis ) .",
    "however , we do nt expect large differences in the results from both hypotheses because the sizes of the snrs are of the same order as comptel s angular resolution of 3.8  ( fwhm ) .",

    "the highest limits for both the point source and the extended source hypotheses were obtained for hb 21 .",
    "formally , hb 21 yields a small signal , but since this snr is embedded in an extended 1.8  emission feature along the direction of cygnus , the signal can possibly be attributed to the local spiral arm ( for a discussion of 1.8  emission from the cygnus region see del rio  ( 1994 ) ) .",

    "the two main parameters which affect the expected 1.8  flux from a snr are its distance and the amount of 26  which was ejected during the sn explosion . for type ii events ,",

    "if type ib sne come from explosions of single wr stars ( woosley 1995 ) , substantial amounts of the 26  which was ejected during the wr phase ( langer  1995 ) and which dominates the explosion yield should still be alive , since the time between the onset of the wr phase and the death of the star is shorter than the 26  lifetime .    the wide range of possible 26  yields for different sn models does not allow to put severe constraints on the snr parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : discussion ] ) . assuming that the observed snrs originate from type ii events , the upper flux limits correspond to minimum remnant distances between 90 and 500 pc , depending on the initial mass of the progenitor star .",

    "ib sn the lower distance limits are somewhat higher , reaching up to 900 pc for an initial progenitor star mass of 140 . thus ,",
