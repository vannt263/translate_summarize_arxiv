    "stimulated by the rapid developments in quantum communication and quantum cryptography , the question as to how to optimally discriminate between different quantum states has gained renewed interest @xcite . the problem is to determine the actual state of a quantum system that is prepared , with given prior probability , in a certain but unknown state belonging to a finite set of given possible states .",
    "when the possible states are not mutually orthogonal , it is impossible to devise a measurement that can distinguish between them perfectly .",
    "therefore optimum measurement strategies have been developed with respect to various criteria .",
    "recently much work has been devoted to the strategy of optimum unambiguous discrimination .",
    "here it is required that , whenever a definite outcome is returned after the state - distinguishing measurement , the result should be error - free , i. e. unambiguous .",
    "this can be achieved at the expense of allowing for a non - zero probability of inconclusive outcomes , where the measurement fails to give a definite answer . when the probability of failure is minimum , optimum unambiguous discrimination is realized .",
    "analytical solutions for the minimum failure probability , @xmath0 , have been found for distinguishing between two @xcite and three @xcite arbitrary pure states , and between any number of pure states that are symmetric and equiprobable @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the investigation of unambiguous discrimination involving mixed states , or sets of pure states , respectively , started only recently @xcite .",
    "so far exact analytical results are known only for simple cases @xcite .",
    "in addition , for unambiguously discriminating between two arbitrary mixed states , general upper and lower bounds have been derived for the minimum failure probability @xcite .",
    "in contrast to unambiguous discrimination , the earliest measurement strategy for distinguishing nonorthogonal quantum states requires that a definite , i. e. conclusive outcome is to be returned in each single measurement .",
    "this means that errors in the conclusive result are unavoidable and the discrimination is ambiguous .",
    "based on the outcome of the measurement , a guess is made as to what the state of the quantum system was .",
    "the optimum measurement then minimizes the probability of errors , i. e. the probability of making a wrong guess . for distinguishing two mixed quantum states ,",
    "a general expression for the minimum achievable error probability , @xmath1 , has been derived in the pioneering work by helstrom @xcite . when more than two given states are involved , an analytical solution is known only for a restricted number of cases the most important of them being the case of equiprobable and symmetric states that are either pure @xcite or mixed @xcite .",
    "finally it is worth mentioning that the original minimum - error discrimination strategy has been extended to determine the minimum achievable probability of errors under the condition that a fixed finite probability of inconclusive outcomes is allowed to occur @xcite , giving no definite result .    in the present contribution",
    "we investigate the relation between the minimum error probability , @xmath1 , for ambiguously distinguishing two mixed quantum states , and the minimum failure probability , @xmath0 , attainable in unambiguous discrimination of the same two states . in section",
    "ii we show that for two arbitrary mixed quantum states the latter is always at least twice as large as the former . as an analytically solvable special example , in section iii we treat the problem of deciding whether the state of the quantum system is either a given pure state , or a mixed state being a uniform statistical mixture of any number of mutually orthogonal states .",
    "first we derive an analytical expression for the minimum error probability in this example , extending a previous result @xcite to the case of arbitrary prior probabilities .",
    "we then perform the comparison with unambiguous discrimination by making use of the general solution for the minimum failure probability in unambiguous quantum state filtering out of an arbitrary number of states @xcite . note that in our preceding work we considered state discrimination involving mixed states in the context of distinguishing between two sets of pure states , referring to the discrimination problem as filtering @xcite when the first set contains only a single state . apart from being an illustration for the general relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , our specific example is of interest on its own for applications that are mentioned in the conclusions .",
    "in the frame of the quantum detection and estimation theory @xcite , a measurement that discriminates between two mixed states , described by the density operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and occurring with the prior probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , can be formally described with the help of two detection operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "these operators are defined in such a way that @xmath8 is the probability to infer the system is in the state @xmath9 if it has been prepared in the state @xmath10 . since the probability is a real non - negative number , the detection operators have to be hermitean and positive - semidefinite . in the error - minimizing measurement scheme",
    "the measurement is required to be exhaustive and conclusive in the sense that in each single case with certainty one of the two possible states is identified , although perhaps incorrectly , while inconclusive results allowing no identification do not occur .",
    "this leads to the requirement @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the unit operator in the @xmath13-dimensional physical state space of the quantum system under consideration .",
    "the overall probability @xmath14 to make an erroneous guess for any of the incoming states is then given by @xmath15 where use has been made of the relation @xmath16 . in order to find the strategy for minimum - error discrimination",
    ", one has to determine the specific set of detection operators that minimizes the value of @xmath17 under the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ -1 ] ) . as found by helstrom @xcite , the smallest achievable error probability @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 for any operator @xmath21 .",
    "while the original derivation of eq .",

    ", we get the representations @xcite @xmath27 the eigenvalues @xmath25 are real , and without loss of generality we can number them in such a way that @xmath28 the optimization task is then to determine the specific operators @xmath6 , or @xmath7 , respectively , that minimize the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ -p ] ) under the constraint that @xmath29 for all eigenstates @xmath24 .",
    "the latter requirement is due to the fact that @xmath8 denotes a probability for any @xmath30 . from this constraint and from eq .",
    "( [ -p ] ) it immediately follows that the smallest possible error probability , @xmath31 , is achieved when the detection operators are chosen in such a way that the equations @xmath32 are fulfilled for eigenstates belonging to negative eigenvalues , while eigenstates corresponding to positive eigenvalues obey the equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "hence the optimum detection operators are given by @xmath35 where these expressions have to be supplemented by projection operators onto eigenstates belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath36 , in such a way that @xmath37 .",
    "( [ -2 ] ) , from the optimum detection operators the minimum error probability is found to be @xcite @xmath38 by taking the sum of these two alternative representations , using @xmath16 , we arrive at @xmath39 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ -hel ] ) .",
    "interestingly , for characterizing the measurement described by the detection operators given in eq .",
    "( [ -op ] ) , two different cases have to be considered .",
    "provided that there are positive as well as negative eigenvalues in the spectral decomposition of @xmath40 , the measurement obviously is a von neumann measurement that consists in performing projections onto the two orthogonal subspaces spanned by the two sets of states @xmath41 and @xmath42 . on the other hand , when negative eigenvalues do not exist it follows that @xmath43 and @xmath44 which means that the minimum error probability can be achieved by always guessing that the quantum system is in the state @xmath45 , without performing any measurement at all .",
    "similar considerations hold true in the absence of positive eigenvalues .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the recent observation @xcite that a measurement does not always aid minimum - error discrimination .",
    "in section iii we shall discuss a corresponding example .    in the error - minimizing scheme for discriminating two mixed states",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 of a quantum system , a non - zero probability of making a correct guess can always be achieved . however , it is obvious that the states can only be distinguished unambiguously when at least one of the mixed states contains at least one component , in the @xmath13-dimensional physical state space of the quantum system , that does not also occur in the other mixed state . as has been shown recently @xcite , the minimum failure probability in unambiguous discrimination , @xmath0 , obeys the inequality @xmath46 ^ 2             &     \\qquad    \\mbox{otherwise}.                           \\end{array }         \\right .",

    "( [ -hel ] ) with the smallest possible failure probability that is achievable in a measurement designed for discriminating the two mixed states unambiguously .",
    "our procedure will be closely related to the derivation of inequalities between the fidelity and the trace distance @xcite . in order to estimate @xmath52 , or the fidelity , respectively , it is advantageous to use a particular orthonormal basis .",

    "( [ f1 ] ) this implies our final result @xmath70 hence for two arbitrary mixed states , occurring with arbitrary prior probabilities , the smallest possible failure probability in unambiguous discrimination is at least twice as large as the minimum probability of errors achievable for ambiguously distinguishing the same states .",
    "for a quantitative comparison between the minimum probabilities of error and of failure we wish to consider a state discrimination problem that involves mixed states and that can be solved analytically with respect to the two different strategies under investigation .",
    "minimum - error discrimination between two mixed states , or between two sets of states consisting both of a certain number of given pure states , respectively , has been recently treated analytically under the restriction that the total hilbert space collectively spanned by the states is only two - dimensional @xcite .",
    "when the dimensionality @xmath71 of the relevant hilbert space is larger than two , however , the explicit analytical evaluation of @xmath1 poses severe difficulites , due to the fact that applying the helstrom formula amounts to calculating the eigenvalues of a @xmath71-dimensional matrix . in the following we consider a simple yet non trivial discrimination problem where we are able to find an analytical solution for minimum - error discrimination in an hilbert space of arbitrary many dimensions .",
    "we assume that the quantum system is either prepared , with the prior probability @xmath4 , in the pure state @xmath72 or , with the prior probability @xmath73 , in a uniform statistical mixture of @xmath74 mutually orthonormal states , described by the density operator @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 denoting the unit operator in the @xmath74-dimensional hilbert space @xmath78 spanned by the states @xmath79 .",

    "this means that in the latter case one can not find a measurement strategy that yields a smaller probability of errors than always guessing that the quantum system is prepared in the state @xmath3 . by inserting the eigenvalues ( [ 21 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ -hel1 ] ) we finally arrive at the minimum error probability @xmath110 for @xmath111 , eq . ( [ p ] ) reduces to the well - known helstrom bound @xcite for minimum - error discrimination between the two pure states @xmath84 and @xmath112 .",

    "the task of distinguishing without errors between the two states given by eqs .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , at the expense of allowing inconclusive results to occur , where the procedure fails , is a special case of unambiguous quantum state filtering @xcite . in the latter problem",

    "as an example , we gave an exact analytical solution to the problem of determining whether the state of the quantum system is either a given pure state occurring with arbitrary prior probability , or a uniform statistical mixture of any number of mutually orthogonal states .",
    "uniformly , i. e. completely mixed states have been considered in the context of estimating the quality of a source of quantum states , as has been recently discussed in connection with single - photon sources , introducing the new measure of suitability @xcite .",
    "this measure relies on identifying all states that would be useful for the specific application , finding a set of states spanning the space of the useful states , and then defining a target state as a complete mixture of those states .",
    "if the mutually orthogonal states in the uniform statisitical mixture span the entire state space of the quantum system , the mixed state describes a totally random state , containing no information at all . discriminating between the pure state and the mixed state then amounts to deciding whether the system has been reliably prepared in the pure state , or whether the preparation has failed @xcite .",
