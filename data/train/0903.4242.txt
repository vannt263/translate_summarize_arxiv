    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) of a quantum many - body system have been attracting the persistent interest of physical researchers in recent years . due to the diversity of quantum phases and qpts",
    ", finding universal ways or methods to characterize qpts is very meaningful and urgent . from the viewpoint of landau - ginzburg theory which has been widely accepted and known in condensed matter physics @xcite ,",
    "qpt is connected with the corresponding order parameter and symmetry breaking . however , there are also some qpts which can not be well understood under the landau - ginzburg paradigm , such as the topological phase transitions @xcite and beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transitions beresinskii , kosterlitz .",
    "recently , an increasing research effort has been focused on the role of ground - state fidelity in characterizing qptsgu_review , htquan , zanardi06 , hqzhou , youwl07,zanardi07prl , schen07pre , schen08pra , buonsante , mfyang , zhouprl . as a basic concept in quantum information science ,",
    "the fidelity measures the similarity between two states and is simply defined as modulus of their overlap @xcite .",
    "the fidelity approach provides us a novel way to understand qpts from the viewpoint of quantum information theory .",
    "so far qpts in various quantum many - body systems @xcite have been shown to be well characterized by the ground - state fidelity or fidelity susceptibility which is the leading term of the fidelity youwl07,zanardi07prl .",
    "generally , one may expect that the structure of the ground states at the different phases is basically different and should reveal itself by some sort of singular behavior in the ground state fidelity or the fidelity susceptibility at the transition point @xcite . despite its great successes of application in various systems , this intuitive idea turns out to be not complete @xcite .",
    "although the fidelity and the fidelity susceptibility can be used to describe first- and second - order qpts@xcite , as well as the topological qpts @xcite successfully , nevertheless there are also some ambiguous cases for that both the two methods mentioned above do not work very effectively @xcite . very recently ,",
    "the controversial issue of bkt phase transition and ground state fidelity has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite from a perspective of matrix product states which essentially depend on a classical simulations of quantum lattice systems @xcite .    in case",
    "that the leading term of the fidelity ( fidelity susceptibility ) works not very effectively , the higher order term in the fidelity may be worth studying .",
    "up to now , there is still lack of literature concerning this part of the fidelity . here",
    ", in this paper , we make an attempt on investigating the effect of higher order term of the fidelity on the characterization of the bkt - type phase transition happened in the heisenberg chain with next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xcite .",
    "we will show that although the fidelity and fidelity susceptibility can not effectively characterize the bkt - type phase transition point for the heisenberg chain with nnn interaction , the higher order term of the fidelity gives a good attempt on detecting such a transition .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we display the formulism of the higher order term of the fidelity .",
    "the subsequent section is devoted to the calculation of the higher order term of the fidelity for the model of heisenberg chain with nnn interaction and show its connection to the quantum phase transition of the system .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "sec : sum .",
    "as usual , the ground state fidelity is defined as the modulus of the overlap between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ground - state wavefunction of hamiltonian @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the driving parameter and @xmath6 is a small deviation in the parameter space of @xmath5 .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility denotes only the leading term of the fidelity .",
    "straightforwardly , one can get the higher order term of the fidelity following similar expansion in deriving the fidelity susceptibility youwl07 . by using the taylor expansion ,",
    "the overlap between two wavefunction @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be expanded to an arbitrary order of @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 therefore , the fidelity becomes @xmath11 we note that @xmath12 and use the relation for a given @xmath13 @xmath14 then we can simplify the expression of ( [ eqf2 ] ) into @xmath15where @xmath16 with the projection operator @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath19 is zero and @xmath20 the fidelity susceptibility @xcite .",
    "next we shall consider the third order fidelity @xmath21 and apply it to judge the phase transition in the spin chain model with nnn exchanges .",
    "alternatively , one can directly derive the expression of @xmath21 from the perturbation expansion of the gs wavefunction . according the perturbation theory , the gs wavefunction , up to the second order , is @xmath22the 3rd order term @xmath21 , which is proportional to the 3rd order derivative of gs fidelity , can be then directly extracted from eq .",
    "( [ f2simple ] ) : @xmath23    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : higherorderdiff ] ) and ( [ eq : higheroderperturb ] ) present the main formulism of the higher order expansion of the fidelity .",
    "so far the explicit physical meaning of the high order term in the fidelity is still not clear .",
    "the expression of 3rd fidelity bears the similarity to its correspondence of the 3rd derivative of gs energy which has the following form @xmath24 obviously , the 3rd fidelity is more divergent than the 3rd derivative of gs energy .",
    "similar connection between the fidelity susceptibility and 2nd derivative of gs energy has been unveiled @xcite .",
    "generally the @xmath25-th order fidelity is much more divergent than its counterpart of @xmath13-th order derivative of gs energy , therefore an @xmath13-th order qpt can be certainly detected by the @xmath13-th order fidelity .",
    "however , this conclusion does not exclude the possibility that @xmath13-th order fidelity can detect a even higher order or infinite order qpt .",
    "a concrete example has been given in ref .",
    "mfyang08 , where a qpt of higher than second order was singled out unambiguously by using the fidelity susceptibility despite the corresponding second derivative of the ground - state energy density showing no signal of divergence .",
    "so far no example of bkt - type qpt unambiguously detected by fidelity susceptibility has been given .",
    "next we shall attempt to apply the third - order fidelity to study the bkt - type transition in a the spin chain model with nnn exchanges .",
    "now we turn to the one - dimensional heisenberg chain with the nnn coupling described by the hamiltonian @xmath26where @xmath27 denotes the spin-1/2 operator at the @xmath28th site , @xmath29 denotes the total number of sites .",
    "the driving parameter @xmath30 represents the ratio between the nnn coupling and the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) coupling .",
    "the gs properties of the model ( [ ham ] ) has been widely studied by both analytical method @xcite and numerical method okamoto , castilla , rchitra , srwhite96 .",
    "the qpt driven by @xmath30 is well understood .",
    "the driving term due to @xmath30 is irrelevant when @xmath31 , and the system flows to a spin fluid or luttinger liquid with massless spinon excitations .",
    "as @xmath32 , the frustration term is relevant and the ground state flows to the dimerized phase with a spin gap open @xcite .",
    "the transition from spin fluid to dimerized phase is known to be of bkt type @xcite , for which the transition point was hard to be determined numerically due to the problem of logarithmic correction @xcite .",
    "the critical value of @xmath33 has been accurately determined by various numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the gs fidelity for the model ( [ ham ] ) has been studied in ref .",
    "schen07pre and also in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of operator fidelity .",
    "no singularities in the gs fidelity or operator fidelity around @xmath34 have been detected for the system with different sizes , which implies that the gs fidelity may be not an effective characterization of the bkt - type qpt in this model .",
    "the bkt - type qpt is a infinite order phase transition where the @xmath13-th order derivative of gs energy is continuous .        , @xmath35 .",
    ", width=340 ]    in light of the higher - order fidelity being more powerful than its energy judgement , we study the possibility for detecting the infinite - order bkt - type qpt via the 3rd order fidelity and focus on the qpt in the spin chain with nnn interactions as a concrete example .",
    "we first calculate the gs wave functions by using the numerical exact diagonalization method for finite size system , and thus the fidelity susceptibility and the 3rd order fidelity can be extracted from the overlap of neighboring gs wave functions . in fig.1 , we display the fidelity susceptibility for systems with different sizes .",
    "we observe that no an obvious peak for the fidelity susceptibility is detected in a wide range of the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "this result suggests that the transition point for the bkt - type qpts can not be very effectively characterized by the fidelity susceptibility either for a finite - size system .",
    "the bkt - type phase transition generally is an infinite order phase transition for which the infinite order derivatives of the ground - state energy is continuous . a good example with exact proof is the bkt - type transition happened in the antiferromagnetic xxz spin chain model yangcn . in the bkt - type transition point",
    ", it has been proven analytically that all the @xmath13-th order derivatives of ground state energy is continuous @xcite . since the @xmath13-th order fidelity is much divergent than its correspondence of derivative of the ground - state energy",
    ", one might expect that there exists the possibility that the @xmath13-th order fidelity is divergent even its @xmath13-th order energy derivative is continuous . to see whether a higher order fidelity works better than fidelity susceptibility in detecting the bkt - type qpt happened in this model , we calculated the 3rd order fidelity versus the driving parameter as shown in fig .",
    "2 . it is clear that a peak is developed in the 3rd order fidelity and the location of peaks tends to get close to the side of transition point @xmath37 with the increase of lattice size . to extrapolate the @xmath38 in the infinite size limit",
    ", we analyze the finite size scaling of position of peak in the fig .",
    "when the system size comes to infinity , the extrapolated value of the phase transition point is @xmath39 , which , within the scope of fitting error , agrees well with @xmath40 obtained by highly accurate numerical methods okamoto , castilla , rchitra , srwhite96 .",
    "we have shown the formulism for the high order of the fidelity in detail and applied it to a concrete model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the one dimensional heisenberg chain with nnn interaction .",
    "we first calculate the ground - state wavefunction of the system by exact diagnolization method , and then extract fidelity susceptibility and the third order of the gs fidelity .",
    "we find that despite the gs fidelity and the fidelity susceptibility being not a very effective detector , the bkt - type phase transition happened in this spin chain model might be effectively detected by the 3rd order term of the gs fidelity for finite - size system .",
    "although the physical meaning of the higher order term of the gs fidelity hasnt been deeply understood , we wish that our observation would stimulate further studies on this issue .",
