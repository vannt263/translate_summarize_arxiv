    "however , the redshift follow - up of the submillimeter sources has been very slow .",
    "because of the large beam size ( @xmath18 ) of scuba and the optically - faint nature of the dusty sources , identifying the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) counterparts to the submillimeter sources is time consuming ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "we used a normalized mips psf to convolve with the mips map and measured the 24@xmath0 m fluxes at the cataloged positions .",

    "the current 20  cm and @xmath8 m samples are not deep enough to have reached the fainter submillimeter sources , while the nir and mir samples are deep enough to have surface densities that are substantially above the required value .",
    "we first computed the contributions to the @xmath4 m ebl from seven samples : the @xmath32-band , 3.6@xmath0 m , 8@xmath0 m , @xmath8 m , and 20  cm selected samples , as well as the @xmath60 and @xmath63-band selected samples from the acs goods - n catalogs of @xcite . for each source in each sample , we determined the beam - weighted @xmath4 m flux and noise from our scuba map ( see  [ secsmm ] ) .",
    "we then measured the error - weighted average @xmath4 m flux for all of the sources in the sample that had errors less than the chosen cut value of 4  mjy .",
    "we also determined the area where each sample had submillimeter measurements of this sensitivity . the ebl contribution",
    "is then given by the product of the number of sources and their error - weighted mean divided by the observed area .",
    "the results are almost identical for cut values other than 4  mjy .",
    "the contribution of each population to the @xmath4 m ebl is summarized in table  [ tab3 ] , where we give the sample wavelength and limiting flux , the area covered , the number of sources , the error - weighted mean 850  @xmath3 m flux for each source , the @xmath4 m ebl contribution with its @xmath68 error , and the @xmath4 m ebl contribution measured from a map where @xmath41 @xmath4 m sources are cleaned ( see below ) .",
    "since the error weighting may result in a very small region dominating the signal , we also computed the unweighted 850  @xmath3 m signal over the same area .",
    "this is given in parentheses in the final two columns of the table .",
    "our results confirm the mir detections made by @xcite with the _ spitzer _ early release observations and the scuba 8  mjy survey , but at substantially higher significance levels . as an example",
    ", there are 493 @xmath8 m sources with @xmath4 m errors less than 4  mjy in the scuba map .",
    "the mean @xmath4 m flux of these sources is @xmath133  mjy .",
    "this is a substantial improvement in signal to noise over the value of @xmath146  mjy found by @xcite due to the large number of @xmath8 m sources in the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "we obtain a consistent average flux of @xmath147  mjy from the unweighted sample , which shows that the lower error regions are not dominating the signal .",
    "the total stacking contribution of the @xmath8 m sources to the @xmath4 m ebl is @xmath148  jy  deg@xmath6 , or about @xmath149% of the total @xmath4 m ebl .",
    "as expected , given that they do not have sufficiently high number densities , the 20  cm and @xmath8 m samples only identify a fraction of the @xmath4 m ebl .",
    "( the radio sample identifies @xmath150  jy  deg@xmath6 , or about @xmath151% of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl . )",
    "it is clear that much deeper samples would be required at both of these wavelengths to substantially identify the @xmath4 m ebl . to try to see",
    "how much fainter we would have to go at @xmath8 m , we generated a fainter @xmath8 m source catalog using sextractor and excluded the original 1173 mips sources .",
    "there are 731 @xmath40 mips sources in this catalog , and 338 of them are in the scuba map .",
    "their median @xmath8 m flux is 46  @xmath3jy , and the faintest ones are @xmath152  @xmath3jy .",
    "these faint @xmath8 m sources possess a weak @xmath4 m stacking signal of @xmath153  jy  deg@xmath6 .",
    "we note that the completeness of the @xmath8 m catalog decreases rapidly from @xmath154 at 80  @xmath3jy to @xmath29 at 40  @xmath3jy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the faint @xmath8 m sources in the @xmath155  @xmath3jy range might make a significant contribution ( @xmath156  jy  deg@xmath6 ) to the 850  @xmath3 m ebl .",
    "however , because of the low statistical significance of the stacking signal , we can not show that this is the case with the current data . to provide a definitive answer",
    ", we would need a substantially complete @xmath8 m catalog to about a 10  @xmath3jy flux .",
    "by contrast , the 8  @xmath3 m sample provides a much more substantial identification of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl ( @xmath157  jy  deg@xmath6 ) , as do all of the shorter wavelength bands .",
    "in fact , at first sight , the optical wavelength bands give the most complete identification of all .",
    "however , on closer inspection , much of this signal comes from the very small hdf - n region , where the submillimeter errors are very low . here",
    "the slightly smaller ebl determined from the unweighted average may be a more representative value .",
    "the signal from each of the samples is , of course , heavily overlapped , and we next compared the samples to see how much additional signal each added . to do this",
    ", we took each sample in turn as our primary sample and then measured signals from the residual sources in each of the other samples after each of the primary sample s overlapping sources were excluded .",
    "that is , we measured the signal from the other samples , after excluding all sources which were already present in the primary sample .",
    "we were able to determine which of the samples were most complementary based on this procedure .",
    "as a result of our analysis , we formed a sample from the combination of all sources with @xmath32-band or @xmath158 m fluxes greater than 1.8  @xmath3jy .",
    "we restricted the sample to the acs goods - n region .",
    "we refer to this sample as our nir sample , and we summarize its properties in the final line of table  [ tab3 ] . physically , since the two bands bracket the peak flux in most galaxy seds over roughly the @xmath159 range , this sample is choosing nearly all of the galaxies with peak observed fluxes above the 1.8  @xmath3jy cut .    from our nir sample ,",
    "we find a contribution of @xmath160  jy  deg@xmath6 , or @xmath161% of the @xmath4 m ebl .",
    "perhaps even more importantly , our nir sample appears to contain nearly all of the ebl that can be measured from the remaining samples .",
    "in other words , when our nir sample is excluded , none of the residual @xmath162 m , @xmath8 m , or radio sample sources gives a signal greater than 1  jy  deg@xmath6 .",
    "the residual @xmath60 and @xmath63-band sample sources give a signal of a few jy  deg@xmath6 in the weighted samples but a null signal in the unweighted samples .",
    "we therefore adopt our nir sample as our primary sample for further analysis .",
    "there are 3121 sources in our nir sample . of these , 2415 are in the original @xmath163 @xmath40 catalog , and a further 374 have @xmath32-band magnitudes brighter than 24 , reflecting the incompleteness of this catalog in the @xmath164 range .",
    "the remaining 332 sources in our nir sample would not have been selected in a complete @xmath165 sample and have only been detected using the 3.6  @xmath3 m catalog ; they give a signal of @xmath166  jy  deg@xmath6 .",
    "thus , the combined catalog gives an improved identification of the ebl relative to either catalog alone .",
    "we visually inspected the @xmath158 m image for all of the sources without optical or nir counterparts to check that these were not spurious .",
    "about 30 sources are suspect , either because they are not clearly seen in the @xmath158 m image , or because they are contaminated by a neighbor .",
    "however , excluding these sources has no effect on the measured signal , and we conclude that there is a significant contribution from the @xmath158 m sources in the sample .",
    "to check the robustness of our results , we performed a number of tests .",
    "first , we summed the total scuba image to find the total flux of our scuba map and found the result to be strictly zero .",
    "this is as expected , since each positive source in the scuba map has two negative 50% sidelobes .",
    "the zero sum of our scuba map indicates that there was good sky subtraction during the data reduction . because of the zero sum of the submillimeter map , any random populations will have zero stacking fluxes , and a positive stacking signal will indicate a correlation between that population and the submillimeter sources . to test this and the assigned statistical errors , we measured fluxes for large numbers of random positions in the scuba image and analyzed these in the same fashion as the real samples .",
    "the results were fully consistent with expectations in both the average signal and the statistical spread .",
    "the third test was a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we used the @xmath8 m source catalog and randomized its astrometry to create simulated @xmath4 m sources .",
    "the @xmath4 m fluxes of the simulated sources were derived from conversions based on m82 and arp  220 .",
    "the simulated sources were added into the `` true noise '' map of @xcite , which has both the bright scuba sources and the faint confusion sources removed , such that only noise is left .",
    "when we measured the @xmath4 m fluxes from the simulated maps , we randomly offset the measured positions from the source positions with up to @xmath167 rms position errors , enough to account for the pointing errors of the submillimeter telescope and the astrometry errors in the @xmath8 m catalog .",
    "the average stacking flux was measured in 100 such realizations using the same methodology as was used in analyzing the true submillimeter image and fully recovered the known input fluxes . in summary ,",
    "our monte carlo simulations and the zero sum of the scuba map show that the stacking flux is an unbiased estimate of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl and that the assigned errors are realistic .    as our fourth test",
    ", we split the nir sample into two parts : one corresponding to sources where the measured submillimeter errors lay between 0.1 and 1.5  mjy , and the other to sources where the errors lay between 1.5 and 4  mjy .",
    "the first sample contained 826 sources and gave an 850  @xmath3 m ebl contribution of @xmath168  jy  deg@xmath6 .",
    "the second sample contained 2295 sources and gave an 850  @xmath3 m ebl contribution of @xmath169  jy  deg@xmath6 , showing that an equivalent signal can be obtained from two samples with very different sensitivities .",
    "correlations in the target sample can result in an upward bias to the signal if the submillimeter flux comes from overdense regions , since , in this case , we overcount the mean flux associated with each source ( e.g. , @xcite ) . given the expected angular correlations in the samples , we do not expect this effect to be large , but it may be present at some level .",
    "we tested this by measuring the average number of galaxies lying within @xmath170 of a given galaxy .",
    "since this is the half - width of the @xmath4 m beam , we expect that only galaxies within this area could be substantially contaminated . for the nir sample described above , which has a surface density of @xmath171 deg@xmath6",
    ", we found an average number of galaxies of 1.1 within this radius .",
    "this is actually smaller than the expected number for a random distribution ( 1.18 ) , so there is very little correlated signal , and the correlation effects on the stacking signal are small . since we shall subsequently restrict the sample even further , we ran this same test on that restricted sample and found a similar result .",
    "other groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) perform stacking analyses on maps where known submillimeter sources are removed . as our final test",
    ", we also removed all known submillimeter sources detected at or above the @xmath172 level from the map and reran our stacking analyses . to do this we subtracted ( cleaned ) the fitted psfs of all of these sources from the image . because our noise estimate does not include the confusion noise ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2004 ) , our @xmath172 cut is comparable to the @xmath173 cut used by most other groups .",
    "we note that such a sigma cut has different flux limits in different areas of our map .",
    "the totol flux removed from the map is only 5.6 jy deg@xmath6 but the sources removed from the deepest areas indeed correspond to a total surface brightness of @xmath152 jy deg@xmath6 according to the number counts in wang et al .",
    "the removal therefore affects the weighted contribution to the ebl more than the unweighted contribition and the later value is comparable to the reduction in the weighted signal while the former matches the change in the unweighted signal . as a consequence of this complex biasing effect from the non - uniform sensitivities",
    ", we decided to use only our uncleaned results .",
    "however , for completeness , we also include our cleaned results in table  3 .",
    "we can further subdivide the contributions to the 850@xmath0 m ebl by galaxy flux , color , and spectral type to determine the properties of the sources giving rise to the light .",
    "we show the contributions to the @xmath4 m ebl from the @xmath32-band sample versus the @xmath32-band flux in figure  [ ebl_flux ] and from the @xmath158 m sample versus the @xmath158 m flux in figure  [ ebl_flux2 ] . in each case , we denote with solid squares the contributions in half dex flux intervals , starting at the limiting flux of the sample .",

    "the light comes from the redder sources in the sample . in the @xmath32-band sample ,",

    "this is in striking contrast to the redshift distribution of the bright scuba sources seen at higher fluxes and identified using their radio counterparts .",
    "it appears that at lower submillimeter fluxes , there is a substantial contribution to the 850  @xmath3 m ebl from galaxies at much lower redshifts than is the case at the higher submillimeter fluxes",

    "however , as we saw in  [ seczdist ] , much of the submillimeter ebl that we have been able to identify from the core nir sample is at lower redshifts , and the submillimeter flux to fir luminosity conversion for these lower luminosity sources may have a much wider range .",

    "in addition , we computed the 20  cm ebl with redshift for only the sources in the @xcite catalog with its limiting flux of 40  @xmath3jy .",
    "as might be expected , since this sample is considerably brighter in flux than the stacking sample , we found a lower peak redshift , with a value of @xmath200 .",
    "we note that figures  [ nir_smm_z ] and [ nir_frad_z ] imply an unusually large submillimeter - to - radio flux ratio at @xmath201 .",
    "this is consistent with cool dust in local low - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or with a great amount of high - redshift background light being lensed by low - redshift sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we next translated the 20  cm ebl into a bolometric luminosity density for each redshift interval .",
    "we used the center redshift of the interval to compute the radio power per unit area , which we then converted to a total luminosity using the fir - radio correlation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we next computed the sfrd assuming that all of the ebl from sources with 850  @xmath3 m fluxes greater than 4  mjy is in the @xmath204 range , where the identified sources of table  [ tab1 ] lie .",

    "[ mdot ] as the dashed line .",
    "the sfrd measured in this way is not independent of the sfrd measured in the core nir sample , since the bright 850  @xmath3 m sources may already be contained in the core nir sample . indeed , the directly determined value lies below the core nir sfrd at these redshifts .",
    "this is because , while we are making the extreme assumption that all of the bright sources lie in this redshift range , only a small fraction of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl lies at these bright fluxes ( about 7  jy  deg@xmath6 ) .",
    "finally , the maximum completeness correction for the submillimeter sfrd in this redshift interval can be determined from the residual 850  @xmath3 m ebl that is not identified by the core nir sample , assuming that it all lies at @xmath214 .",

    "the sfrd derived from the core nir sample using the radio data is @xmath216  yr@xmath35  mpc@xmath217 at @xmath218 and is almost identical to that at @xmath112 .",
    "even the maximum completeness correction of @xmath219  yr@xmath35  mpc@xmath217 to @xmath220  yr@xmath35  mpc@xmath217 can only result in a star - formation history that is rising slowly above @xmath221 .",
    "when integrated through time , it appears that the majority of the star formation occurs around @xmath218 .",
    "thus , previous claims that the submillimeter sfrd is strongly peaked at @xmath112 appear to be incorrect .      in figure  [ sfh ]",
    ", we compare the sfrd determined here with the sfrd determined from uv observations .",
    "both are computed consistently with a salpeter imf extending to @xmath222 .",
    "however , rather than plotting @xmath223 versus redshift , as is usually done , we plot the quantity @xmath224 versus the cosmic time , @xmath225 .",
    "the advantage of this display is that we can see more directly how many stars are formed at a given time .",
    "we use diamonds and triangles to show the direct star formation determinations from the uv light without any correction for extinction .",
    "we use solid squares to show our directly measured fir star formation , and we use open squares to show our maximal corrections for the missing ebl , if it is formed in the @xmath204 redshift range .",
    "the fir star formation is about a factor of 3 to 5 higher than the uncorrected uv star formation , depending on the correction applied for the missing @xmath4 m light _ ( dotted curves)_. the lower value corresponds to the directly measured light , and the upper value to the maximally corrected light .",
    "this is consistent with the usual dust corrections applied to the uv star formation rates , but it should be noted that the samples are somewhat disjoint , in that the blue star - forming galaxies ( our template classes 6 and 7 ) contribute substantially to the uv star formation but not to the fir star formation .",
    "thus , the extinction corrections must be higher in the galaxies that produce the bulk of the fir light and lower in the blue star - forming galaxies .",
    "we have also computed the total amount of stars formed as a function of time by combining the fir and uv star - formation histories and integrating with respect to cosmic time . above @xmath226 , where we do not have any information about the fir light",
    ", we have assumed that the total star formation is five times the uv star formation , but the results at later times are quite insensitive to this assumption , since only a very small part of the total star formation occurs at these early times .",
    "the cumulative total is shown by the solid curves , where the lower curve corresponds to the directly measured fir star formation and the upper curve to the maximally corrected fir star formation . at @xmath105 , the curves match suprisingly well to the local determination of the stellar mass density @xcite , which is shown by the large solid circle in figure  [ sfh ] .",
    "the agreement is best for the lower estimates , but even for the maximally corrected case , the curve is only slightly high . for the directly measured case ,",
    "half of the star formation occurs at @xmath227 , while in the maximally corrected case , this rises to @xmath228 .",
    "we have obtained accurate redshifts for the sources in the goods - n area using existing spectroscopic redshifts and improved photometric redshifts from nir and mir data .",
    "the radio - identified bright ( @xmath106  mjy ) scuba sources in this area are in the redshift range @xmath214 and have a median redshift of @xmath113 , consistent with previous radio and spectroscopic surveys .    however , we used a stacking analysis to show that much of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl is in fact traced by a nir sample constructed from sources with fluxes greater than @xmath229jy in either the @xmath32 or @xmath158 m bands .",
    "we showed that much of this light arises from galaxies with intermediate spectral types at @xmath33 .",
    "thus , many of the fainter submillimeter sources that give rise to most of the 850  @xmath3 m ebl are at lower redshifts and lower luminosities than the bright submillimeter sources that are detected directly .    finally , we used a stacking analysis to estimate the average 20  cm ebl produced by the unidentified or intermediate spectral type galaxies in our nir sample as a function of redshift , from which we determined the sfrd .",
    "we found that this sfrd evolves rapidly between @xmath105 and @xmath202 , after which it becomes approximately flat . using the submillimeter data directly",
    ", we then calculated a submillimeter based sfrd at @xmath230 which agrees closely with the radio based sfrd .",
    "in addition , by assuming that all of the submillimeter ebl that is not accounted for by our nir sample is also at these redshifts , we put an upper bound on the sfrd at @xmath230 . even with this maximum completeness correction , we found consistency with a nearly flat or slowly rising extrapolation of the sfrd from @xmath201 .",
    "we conclude that the majority of the star formation traced by the submillimeter light comes from redshifts near one rather than at the higher redshifts that have been favored until now .",
