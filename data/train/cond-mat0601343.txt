    "density functional theory @xcite ( dft ) is by now the most popular method for electronic structure calculations in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry , because of its unique combination of low computational cost and high accuracy for many molecules and solids .",
    "there are , however , exceptions to such an accuracy . even the best approximations of its key ingredient , the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy functional , can not describe strong electron correlations , like those of the cuprates , and can not exactly cancel the so - called self - interaction , a property which the exact functional should satisfy . on top of that , they fail to recover long - range van der waals interactions,@xcite are not completely safe for the description of the hydrogen bond,@xcite and have intrinsic problems with situations of near degeneracy ( when two sets of kohn - sham orbitals have very close energies);@xcite more generally , the `` chemical accuracy '' has not yet been reached . to overcome the latter group of problems ,",
    "there has been a growing interest in `` mixed schemes '' which combine the dft with other approximate methods by splitting the coulombic electron - electron interaction @xmath0 into a short - range ( sr ) and a long - range ( lr ) part ( see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "the idea is to use different approximations for the lr and the sr contributions to the exchange and/or correlation energy density functionals of the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme .",
    "it descends from the observation that lr correlations , poorly described by local or semi - local density functionals , can be accurately dealt with by other techniques , like the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) or standard wavefunction methods of quantum chemistry .",
    "conversely , correlation effects due to the sr part of the electron - electron interaction are in general well described by local or semilocal functionals.@xcite the error function and its complement = v_ee(r)=v_sr^(r)+v_lr^(r)= + [ eq_split ] where @xmath1 controls the range of the decomposition , are often used@xcite to split the coulomb interaction into a sr and a lr part , since they yield analytic matrix elements for both gaussians and plane waves , i.e. , the most common basis functions in quantum chemistry and solid state physics .",

    "in any event , for actual electronic - structure calculations to be performed , these functionals ultimately need approximations , in analogy with the standard dft . regardless of the strategy adopted",
    ", the potential superiority of  mixed schemes \" comes into play precisely at this stage : compared to the standard version , a dft which only deals with the sr part of the electron - electron interaction should be much more accurately approximated , as mentioned , by local - density xc energy functionals.@xcite while both decompositions [ eq .

    "the purpose of this paper is to provide , based on novel exact limits and quantum monte carlo simulations , an accurate representation for the energy of the lr - only interacting heg not only as a function of the cutoff parameter @xmath1 and of the total electron density , but also as a function of the spin polarization [ i.e. , as a function of the spin densities @xmath6 and @xmath7 separately ] . since von barth and hedin@xcite showed , in 1972 , that the task of finding good approximations to exchange - correlation density functionals is greatly simplified if the functional is expressed in terms of the spin densities , and that this is the simplest way to satisfy the requirement ( hund s rule ) that a state with larger spin tends to be energetically favored , the importance of including such a spin dependence in approximate functionals was confirmed by countless calculations for molecules and solids.@xcite in this context the decomposition of eq .",
