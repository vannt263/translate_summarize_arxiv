    "<S> mechanical equilibrium requires the difference between the internal and external stresses acting on the cell edge to balance the contractile forces arising in the cortex : @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the stress tensors outside and inside the cell and @xmath3 is the stress resultant along the cell cortex . </S>",

    "<S> the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are material constants that embody the biomechanical activity of myosin motors in the actin cytoskeleton . </S>",
