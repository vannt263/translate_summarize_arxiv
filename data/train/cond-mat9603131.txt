    "the mechanism responsible for high @xmath1 superconductivity is still highly controversial @xcite .",
    "while a large part of the theoretical effort is based on the hypothesis that cooper pairs are formed in high @xmath1 compounds , there is no agreement on the physical origin of the pairing interaction nor on the symmetry of the pair wavefunction .",
    "these two questions are actually intimately related . indeed repulsive interactions , such as produced by spin fluctuations @xcite ,",
    "require an order parameter which changes sign on the fermi surface in order to produce pairs .",
    "this leads , in the simplest hypothesis , to pairing with d - wave symmetry if we assume singlet pairing . on the other hand purely attractive interactions",
    "lead to pairing with s - wave symmetry since any change of sign is unfavorable in this case .",
    "therefore an experimental determination of the order parameter symmetry should greatly help to identify the physical interaction responsible for pair formation : although it would not be enough to provide a unique identification , it would strongly narrow the remaining possibilities . for this reason",
    "a large part of the recent experimental work has been aimed toward providing a clear signature for the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "quite surprisingly recent experiments on @xmath3 designed with this purpose of identifying the symmetry have given clear cut , but contradictory answers @xcite .",
    "indeed the observation of a sizeable josephson current @xcite in a c - axis tunnelling junction between @xmath3 and pb is quite difficult to reconcile with a pure d - wave symmetry while it is in full agreement with s - wave symmetry .",
    "similarly the fact that there is no angular dependence in the critical current of ybco - ybco grain boundary junctions in the a - b plane @xcite goes clearly in the direction of an s - wave interpretation . on the other hand",
    "a number of experiments are in favor of a d - wave symmetry .",
    "many experiments , including tunnelling , nmr , raman scattering , photoemission , penetration depth @xcite , have shown the existence of low energy excited states . actually these experiments are compatible with a strongly anisotropic s - wave order parameter . or more simply one may look for extrinsic effects and wonder if these states do not arise from surface effects or defects , which would provide quasi - normal regions .",
    "however the existence of a linear t dependence of the penetration depth over a large range of temperature , simultaneously in cristals and films , with the same slope @xcite , makes an extrinsic interpretation for all these experiments unlikely ( while this kind of explanation may very well be valid for some of them ) .",
    "moreover some experiments specifically designed to check if the order parameter changes sign over the fermi surface have given positive answers .",
    "these are the corner squid experiments @xcite which give a clear indication for a change of sign of the order parameter between the a and the b axis , and the observation of a spontaneous magnetization corresponding to a half magnetic flux quantum in 3 grain - boundary josephson junctions @xcite which implies a @xmath4 shift , in clear agreement with d - wave symmetry .",
    "on the other hand the d - wave interpretation is not free of problems .",
    "for example recent experiments show that some thermodynamical superconducting properties are markedly anisotropic ( the a and b - axis results are different ) .",
    "indeed the penetration depth in good ybco cristals display a strong anisotropy of the penetration depth @xcite , the specific heat anomaly at @xmath1 of the parent compound @xmath5 ( with same @xmath1 as ybco ) has a marked anisotropy as a function of the orientation of an applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to ascribe these anisotropies to the weak orthorhombic distorsion , and it is more likely that the cuo chains play a significant role in the superconducting properties .",
    "one of the most conspicuous problem of the d - wave interpretation is the weak sensitivity of the critical temperature of @xmath3 to the presence of impurities . indeed any kind of impurities , whether magnetic or not , produces in d - wave superconductors @xcite an effect analogous to pair - breaking by magnetic impurities in standard s - wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular the critical temperature @xcite decreases rapidly with increasing impurity concentration following the abrikosov - gorkov law @xcite , and superconductivity disappears at a critical concentration .",
    "in contrast all samples of @xmath3 seem to have a @xmath1 around 90 k. it is difficult to believe that all samples ( including the earlier ones ) are clean enough to affect only weakly the critical temperature , whereas all microscopic studies show that there are always more structural defects than what is generally admitted .",
    "moreover ion @xcite or electron @xcite irradiation experiments have shown a rather weak sensitivity of the critical temperature of @xmath3 on the inverse lifetime deduced from resistivity measurements @xcite .",
    "actually zn impurities are known @xcite to have a depressing effect on @xmath6 but this can be interpreted as a standard pair - breaking effect since the environment of a zn impurity , located in the @xmath7 planes , is known to be magnetic @xcite .    in order to solve these contradictions we have proposed recently @xcite for @xmath3 a model which mixes s - wave and d - wave features . in our model , in addition to the @xmath7 planes , the cuo chains play an essential role . the pairing interaction within the planes is attractive ( it can be for example produced by phonons ) . on the other hand",
    "the pairing interaction between planes and chains is repulsive ( it can be produced by coulomb interaction ) . in this way",
    "the order parameter has opposite signs on the planes and on the chains .",
    "moreover we include the hybridization between planes and chains , which corresponds physically to take into account the possibility for an electron to jump from planes to chains or vice - versa .",
    "naturally the coupling responsible for this hybridization is fairly small , but it is a well known feature of all band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "it is of importance only when the plane and the chain band intersect . in this case",
    "it leads to an anticrossing in the dispersion relations , and similarly to an anticrossing of the fermi surfaces , wherever the ( uncoupled ) pieces of the fermi surface related to plane and chain cross . as a result ,",
    "when we move on a given sheet of the fermi surface , we go from a part which corresponds physically to a plane electron , to a part which corresponds physically to a chain electron .",
    "since the order parameter has opposite signs for plane and chain electrons , this implies that the order parameter changes sign on a given sheet of the fermi surface and therefore has nodes on this sheet by continuity .",
    "therefore our model provides an order parameter which is quite analogous to a d - wave order parameter and it can in this way explain @xcite all the experiments in favor of d - wave symmetry . on the other hand it does not have a d - wave symmetry since the nodes , which occur at the intersection between plane and chain bands , have no reason to satisfy @xmath8 = @xmath9 , and the average of the order parameter has no symmetry reason to be zero .",
    "hence there is for example no problem with the nonzero josephson current in @xmath3 - pb junctions along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "moreover since the attractive in - plane interaction and the repulsive interaction between plane and chain help each other , there is no problem to explain the high value of the critical temperature of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "naturally our model is specific of @xmath3 , but we can think that it can be generalized to other compounds where the role of the chains can be played by other parts of the structure , such as the bio planes in bssco . on the other hand",
    "there is no possibility of this kind in lsco and accordingly we do not expect experiments to display in this compound the same physical features as in ybco .",
    "our model has common features with many other models .",
    "as a two band model it is quite similar to the two band models introduced by suhl , matthias and walker and others @xcite to describe superconductivity in transition metals .",
    "the possibility of an interband repulsive interaction in two band models was already introduced by kondo @xcite .",
    "more recently a two band s - n model has been introduced by abrikosov and klemm @xcite to account for raman scattering data .",
    "the idea of an interband repulsion has been put forward by various groups @xcite recently in the context of high @xmath1 superconductivity in order to show that experiments displaying a change of sign of the order parameter did not necessarily imply a spin fluctuation mechanism .",
    "our model is also similar to the one proposed by abrikosov @xcite , where there are attractive and repulsive interactions within a single band , leading to a change of sign of the order parameter within this band .",
    "finally , as noted above , chain - plane hybridization is a standard feature of band structure calculations @xcite and there have been various suggestions of the importance of the chains in the physics of @xmath10 whether for intrinsic or for extrinsic reasons @xcite , these models allowing for the electron to jump between planes and chains .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of impurities on the critical temperature in our model .",
    "we will actually restrict ourselves to non magnetic impurities .",
    "indeed magnetic impurities are easily included , but they will naturally lead to pair - breaking and produce a @xmath1 following the ag law as in other models . hence magnetic impurities can not discriminate between various models and we ignore them for simplicity .",
    "the conclusion of our study is that , in our model , for generic parameters , the critical temperature is much less sensitive to impurities than in standard d - wave models .",
    "therefore we might say that , with respect to the sensitivity of the critical temperature to non magnetic impurities , our model behaves as a  weak  d - wave model .",
    "this happens for two independent reasons .",
    "first the reduction of @xmath1 is due to plane - chain scattering , which is weak compared to plane - plane scattering .",
    "next the fact that we have a two band model provides further possibilities for a weak impurity sensitivity . in section",
    "ii we present our model and we calculate the critical temperature of the clean superconductor as a first step toward the calculation of the impurity dependence , which is dealt with in section iii . finally section iv is devoted to a comparison with experimental results and to our conclusion .",
    "let us first define specifically our model . we will describe the motion of an electron in planes and chains by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are creation operators in the plane and in the chain band respectively .",
    "the first term corresponds to an isolated plane with dispersion relation @xmath14 the second one to isolated chains with dispersion relation @xmath15 and the last term describes hopping between planes and chains .",
    "actually this independent electron hamiltonian does not correspond precisely to the situation found in @xmath3 .",
    "indeed @xmath3 is build by stacking up sets made of two @xmath7 planes and one cuo chains plane .",
    "therefore a better description is obtained by the hamiltonian :    @xmath16    where all quantities are understood to depend on @xmath8 and @xmath9 and summations run also over @xmath17 the indices 1 and 2 number the @xmath7 planes and the index n numbers the stacks . introducing the even and odd plane band operators @xmath18 by @xmath19 = ( @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 , and taking the fourier transform in the z direction ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath24    where a dependence and summation on @xmath25 is now understood , and t @xmath26 = t @xmath27 and t @xmath28 = t @xmath29 , with c being the size of the unit cell along the z direction .",
    "band structure calculations @xcite give a crossing of the chain band fermi surface with the odd plane band fermi surface , whereas there is no crossing with the even plane band .",
    "therefore the even plane band will not play an interesting physical role in our model and we will forget it for simplicity , but it should clearly be retained in a very realistic calculation .",
    "this leads us back to the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) where the plane band is actually the odd plane band .",
    "the hopping term has a @xmath25 dependence as given by t @xmath28 .",
    "however , if the even plane band happens to cross the chain band , we would have no problem in extending our model .",
    "this would be particularly easy in the two extreme cases where the even and odd plane bands are nearly degenerate ( t @xmath30 @xmath31 t @xmath32 ) or well separated ( t @xmath30 @xmath33 t @xmath32 ) since we would be led again to the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) .    with respect to pairing interactions , as we have already indicated , we take an attractive pairing interaction in the plane which can be for example due to phonon exchange . on the other hand",
    "we assume a repulsive pairing interaction between plane and chain .",
    "a natural physical origin for this term is the coulomb repulsion , since screening is certainly not very efficient in ybco because it is a weak metal .",
    "moreover screening is probably very ineffective along the z direction since hopping in this direction is small .",
    "we note however that hopping is physically necessary in order to have a pairing term between planes and chains .",
    "finally there is little experimental evidence for an attractive pairing interaction in the chains .",
    "however we will assume its existence for the sake of generality .",
    "we include also the standard intraband coulomb repulsion .",
    "let us first consider the critical temperature of the clean superconductor . in a first step we ignore the hopping term t @xmath34 the eliashberg equations at the critical temperature",
    "are :    @xmath35    @xmath36    here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the order parameter and the renormalization function at the matsubara frequency @xmath39 primed quantities refer to the chains while unprimed ones correspond to the planes ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the effective frequency dependent interactions due to phonon exchange while @xmath42 @xmath43 and k , k are the intraband and interband coulomb repulsion with cut - off @xmath44 of order of the fermi energy .",
    "while the interactions that we consider here have certainly a wavevector dependence in the real superconductor , we have no precise idea of what they are nor do we have any physical reason to believe that this dependence is strong .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity and clarity , we have taken isotropic interactions within planes and chains .",
    "we can now proceed to the usual reduction of the cut - off from @xmath44 to a frequency @xmath45 a few times a typical phonon frequency . for",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 , the order parameters @xmath37 and @xmath49 become constants @xmath50 and @xmath51 while @xmath38 , @xmath52 @xmath53 1 .",
    "these constants are obtained from eq.(4 ) and ( 5 ) as :    @xmath54    @xmath55    where r = ln @xmath56 / @xmath57 . when these results are carried into eq.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , one obtains the same equations , except that the cut - off is now @xmath45 and @xmath42 @xmath43 and k , k are replaced by renormalized coulomb interactions @xmath58 @xmath59 and k * , k * given by :    @xmath60    and similar expressions for @xmath59 and k * obtained by exchanging primed and unprimed quantities . naturally one recovers the standard coulomb pseudopotential when there is no interband interaction .",
    "it seems safe to assume @xmath61 - kk @xmath47 0 , otherwise we would have pairing from s - wave coulomb interaction alone ( when pairing from coulomb interaction is considered , this is usely for higher angular momenta ) . in this case renormalization",
    "does not change the sign of the various quantities .",
    "we see that , in addition to its direct effect , interband interaction decreases the effective intraband repulsion , leading to an increase of the critical temperature as it should @xcite . in the following",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the weak coupling limit where @xmath37 and @xmath49 can be taken as constants and mass renormalization is negligible .",
    "indeed , as it will be clear in the following , we do not expect strong coupling effects to modify qualitatively our conclusions . in this case @xmath1",
    "depends only on the combinations @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 - @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath63 @xmath67 - @xmath68 in addition to k * and k*. from now on we will omit the star for all the renormalized coupling constants . then ,",
    "if we let x = ln ( @xmath69 / @xmath1 ) where @xmath69 is a typical phonon frequency ( or rather 1/4 of a typical phonon frequency @xcite ) , @xmath1 is obtained from :    @xmath70    which is the standard two band result @xcite .",
    "although one expects physically that coulomb interaction reduces the isotope effect , this is not obvious from eq.(8 ) and ( 9 ) .",
    "this has been shown to be true by kondo @xcite in some limiting cases .",
    "we show in the appendix that this property holds quite generally .    as a preliminary to the calculation with impurities ,",
    "let us finally consider how the above calculation of the critical temperature is modified when we take into account the hybridization t @xmath71 between planes and chain . as indicated above , we take isotropic interactions and order parameters in the planes and in the chains . corresponding to the effective interaction hamiltonian :    @xmath72    the order parameter satisfy :    @xmath73    @xmath74    however because of the hybridization , the plane and chain operators @xmath75 and @xmath76 do not correspond to the eigenstates of @xmath77 the unitary transformation :    @xmath78    diagonalizes the hamiltonian into @xmath79 = @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 where we have set for convenience @xmath84 @xmath63 c and @xmath85 @xmath86 d .",
    "the energies @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the hybridized bands are given by 2 @xmath89 = @xmath90 + @xmath91 @xmath21 [ ( @xmath90 - @xmath91 @xmath92 + 4 t @xmath93 @xmath94^{1/2 } $ ] and @xmath95 = @xmath96 = @xmath97 - @xmath98 - @xmath99^{1/2 } $ ] @xmath63 @xmath100 , @xmath101 = - @xmath102 = @xmath97 - @xmath103 - @xmath99^{1/2 } $ ] @xmath63 @xmath104 , with again the k dependence understood everywhere .",
    "when we carry out this transformation in the mean field hamiltonian :    @xmath105    we will obtain interband pairing terms , such as @xmath106 @xmath107 , coupling the hybridized bands .",
    "however we will consider that t @xmath71 is large enough so that these bands are well separated .",
    "specifically this means that we assume @xmath45 @xmath31 t @xmath71 ( otherwise we should make a much more careful strong coupling treatment , which would probably not bring anything new qualitatively ) . in this case",
    "the above pairing terms will be negligible because we can not have two electrons ( k,1 ) and ( -k,2 ) at the fermi surface with opposite wavevectors , but belonging to different bands ( we will justify more specifically this approximation in the next section ) .",
    "therefore the transformation eq.(13 ) gives :    @xmath108    with @xmath109 = @xmath110 @xmath111 + @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 = @xmath110 @xmath113 + @xmath115 @xmath111 .",
    "naturally this band diagonal expression for the hamiltonian is obvious once the interband pairing terms are neglected , and we could have written it immediately .",
    "our essential point is that , starting from isotropic interactions in planes and chains , we obtain a specific anisotropy for the order parameter @xmath109 and @xmath114 .",
    "in particular we obtain nodes at the fermi surface since we have managed to have @xmath110 and @xmath112 with opposite signs , and @xmath111 goes from 0 to 1 when we move at the fermi surface of a given band .",
    "therefore we have an order parameter which is d - wave like , although we have assumed an attractive pairing in the planes .",
    "we have then as usual @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath117 @xmath119 @xmath47 = - @xmath120 @xmath121 from eq.(11),(12 ) and ( 13 ) this leads to :    @xmath122    @xmath123    since the bands are well separated , the * k * summations will be around the fermi surface of each band with cut - off @xmath45 for @xmath124 .",
    "the integration perpendicular to the fermi surface will give the standard factor x = ln ( 1.13 @xmath125 @xmath45 ) and we are left with summations along the fermi surface :    @xmath126    @xmath127    where the order parameter @xmath128 should not be confused with the dirac function @xmath129 .",
    "for @xmath130 = 0 we have @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 + @xmath134 and @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath135 + @xmath134 for @xmath136 = 0 .",
    "moreover for most of the fermi surface we have @xmath90 @xmath31 @xmath91 or @xmath91 @xmath31 @xmath90 leading to @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath137 or 1 .",
    "this corresponds merely to the result one obtains without hybridization .",
    "subtracting from eq.(18 ) and ( 19 ) their counterpart without hybridization , we are left with summations over quantities which are essentially nonzero only in the anticrossing region . in this small region",
    "it is convenient to take , at fixed @xmath138 @xmath90 and @xmath91 as new variables instead of @xmath8 and @xmath139 the jacobian of the transformation is j = @xmath140",
    "@xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 ) = @xmath144 @xmath145 x @xmath146 @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the fermi velocities of the plane and chain band at the crossing point .",
    "we are then led to evaluate :    @xmath147 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath148 = @xmath149 or @xmath150 or @xmath151 this is easily done by taking @xmath152 @xmath71 and @xmath153 @xmath71 as new variables and extending the boundaries of the integrals to infinity .",
    "the result is the same for the three integrals , namely - @xmath4 @xmath154 @xmath71 @xmath155 when this result is carried into eq.(18 ) and ( 19 ) we find naturally the first order correction to the coupling constants @xmath156 = @xmath157 g , @xmath158 = @xmath159 g , k = @xmath159 k and k = @xmath157 k , where @xmath157 and @xmath159 are the total density of states of the ( uncoupled ) plane and chain bands .",
    "the hybridization changes these coupling constants respectively into @xmath156 - @xmath160 ( g+k ) , @xmath158 - @xmath160 ( g+k ) , k - @xmath160 ( g+k ) and k - @xmath160 ( g+k ) . here",
    "@xmath160 is an effective density of states due to the hybridization and given by @xmath160 = @xmath161 @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the average of @xmath154 @xmath71 @xmath144 over @xmath25 ( we have taken into account that there are 4 crossings in the brillouin zone ) .",
    "naturally since we have @xmath160 @xmath31 @xmath157 , @xmath159 in our model these changes are small .",
    "we consider now the effect on the critical temperature of impurities located in the planes and in the chains .",
    "we will assume that the impurity potential scatters electrons within the planes or within the chains , but that it does not scatter them from plane to chain .",
    "our physical motivation is naturally that planes and chains are physically well separated , which corresponds to the fact that the hopping term t @xmath71 is small .",
    "therefore the potential for scattering from plane to chain is reduced by a factor of order t @xmath71 / @xmath164 compared to the intraplane or intrachain scattering ( where @xmath164 is a typical hopping term within planes or chains ) .",
    "this physical point is essential for the validity of our result . including this small plane - chain scattering does not make any problem , but for sake of clarity and simplicity we will not do it explicitly and we will rather come back to this point after we have obtained the effect of intraplane and intrachain scattering .",
    "we will also take an isotropic scattering within plane and chain , consistently with what we have done for the interactions . here again we will come back later on to the effect of a possible anisotropy .",
    "this leads us to the following impurity potential :    @xmath165    we treat this potential within the born approximation since , for the calculation of the critical temperature , making use of the t - matrix approximation is merely equivalent to renormalize the scattering potential .",
    "there is however another effect produced by going beyond the born approximation , which will be considered at the end of this section .    within the born approximation and after impurity averaging , only contributions to the self - energy corresponding to scattering twice on the same impurity",
    "are retained @xcite . since the potential eq.(20 )",
    "does not scatter electrons from plane to chain , the impurities contribution to the self - energy has only components within planes or chains .",
    "they are given by @xcite :    @xmath166    where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the number of impurities per unit volume in the planes and in the chains , @xmath169 are the pauli matrices in nambu space and g is the temperature green s function in plane - chain representation .",
    "the green s function is related to the self - energy by :    @xmath170    where @xmath171 is the green s function in the absence of the impurity self - energy .",
    "explicitly we set :    @xmath172    @xmath173    where @xmath174 @xmath132 @xmath175 @xmath4 t is the matsubara frequency ( we omit systematically for clarity",
    "the index n in the matsubara frequency and all frequency dependent quantities ) , @xmath176 is the pauli matrix in plane - chain space and @xmath177 is the off - diagonal self - energy due to the pairing interaction ( we have set @xmath178 @xmath63 @xmath90 and @xmath179 @xmath63 @xmath91 ) . in order to invert",
    "@xmath180 it is convenient to go the hybridized band representation , or more precisely to make the transformation which diagonalizes @xmath180 when the off - diagonal part @xmath181 of the self - energy is zero .",
    "for @xmath182 the transformation matrix is just @xmath183 @xmath184 where @xmath183 is the transformation considered in the preceding section . in the present case we have merely to formally generalize it by replacing @xmath185 by @xmath185 - i @xmath186 for the particule - particule part in nambu space and by @xmath185 + i @xmath186 in the hole - hole part .",
    "we keep the same notation for this transformation , but the @xmath183 are now complex .",
    "the complete transformation matrix is now @xmath187 = ( @xmath183 + @xmath188 ) @xmath184 /2 + ( @xmath183 - @xmath188 ) @xmath189 /2 .",
    "actually we have @xmath80 , @xmath110 @xmath31 t since we assume that the hybridized bands are well separated ( @xmath80 or @xmath110 are typically of the same order of magnitude in the important cases as it will be clear below ) .",
    "moreover as usual we will be only concerned with matsubara frequencies @xmath174 at most of order @xmath80 and @xmath110 and therefore negligible compared to t .",
    "this implies that , when it multiplies a quantity of order @xmath80 or @xmath110 @xmath190 we can take for @xmath183 its zero order value , namely the real value found in the preceding section .",

    "@xmath116 kk , the interband coupling is too strong for the state with the ill - chosen signs of the order parameter to exist and the unstable solution disappears ( there is still a mathematical solution with @xmath273 @xmath116 0 but it must be rejected physically because it does not satisfy the weak coupling condition x @xmath33 1 anymore ) .",
    "finally we have ( @xmath274 - kk ) @xmath277 = ( @xmath156 k + @xmath158 k + 2 kk ) / ( k+k ) in eq.(42 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that one has always @xmath272 @xmath116 @xmath277 @xmath116 @xmath273 for @xmath274 @xmath47 kk , while @xmath273 @xmath116 @xmath277 @xmath116 @xmath272 is satisfied for @xmath274 @xmath116 kk .",

    "then it is easy to see graphically that , starting from @xmath272 for @xmath117 = 0 , x as given by eq.(42 ) is an increasing function of @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , in all possible cases , the critical temperature decreases when the impurity concentration increases .    for @xmath274",
    "@xmath47 kk the increase of x saturates at @xmath277 leading to a large concentration limit @xmath281 for the critical temperature given , as found by kusakabe @xcite , by :    @xmath282    this saturation corresponds physically to the situation where strong impurity scattering has made the order parameter completely isotropic",
    "@xmath252 = @xmath283 while ( @xmath252 - @xmath253 ) @xmath265 takes an independent nonzero value .",

    "@xmath47 kk requires not too small coupling constants @xmath156 and @xmath158 in both bands . in ybco it is not clear at all that the cu0 chains alone have a superconducting tendency . if we have @xmath158 @xmath53 0 , the condition",
    "@xmath274 @xmath47 kk can not be satisfied .    for @xmath274 @xmath116 kk",
    "there is no saturation in the increase of x and the critical temperature goes to zero when the impurity concentration is increased , as found by kusakabe @xcite .",
    "however when we substitute in eq.(42 ) the large x behaviour of @xmath288 we obtain :    @xmath289    where @xmath290 is the critical temperature without impurities .",
    "therefore @xmath1 goes to zero for a critical impurity concentration and we find in this case a behaviour similar to the standard d - wave result .",

    "therefore the lowest possible value of @xmath291 is the standard d - wave result @xmath291 = .88 @xmath290 , but it can easily be much higher since it is given by the exponential of the r.h.s . of eq.(45 ) . from this",
    ", one would conclude that , for a given @xmath293 our model is much less sensitive to impurities than standard d - waves .",
    "however when one looks at the behaviour of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath293 one sees that this large value of @xmath291 is obtained at the end of a long tail where the value of @xmath1 is already quite small , as it can be seen in fig.1 . therefore in order to fully characterize the sensitivity of @xmath1 to impurities , we have also to look at the initial slope found for low impurity concentration .    in this regime",
    "we have from eq.(42 ) :    @xmath294 \\label{eq46}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is the result of moskalenko and palistrant @xcite . as they indicated , ( @xmath272 - @xmath277 ) / ( @xmath272 - @xmath273 ) goes from 0 to 1 , which implies that the decrease of @xmath1 is always less than for the pure d - wave case .",
    "the d - wave result is obtained in the limiting case @xmath156 - @xmath158 = k - k or k @xmath279 0 .",
    "on the other hand for k @xmath279 0 ( and fixed k ) , the critical temperature does not depend anymore on the impurity concentration ( this result is actually valid whatever the impurity concentration as it can be seen from eq.(42 ) ) .",
    "this limiting case is not unphysical since it corresponds to a situation where the density of states @xmath159 in the chains would be very small .",
    "we would still have a d - wave type order parameter with change of sign and nodes , but the critical temperature would be completely controlled by the planes and the chains would simply follow .",
    "therefore we have the surprising result of a superconducting phase with a d - wave type order parameter which has a critical temperature insensitive to impurities just as an s - wave superconductor .",
    "however it is fair to say that we do not expect such a limiting situation to occur in ybco .",
    "hence we believe that in our case eq.(46 ) leads to a sensitivity to impurity which is always somewhat reduced with respect to the standard d - wave case , but not by a large factor .",
    "an example of the general behaviour of @xmath1 @xmath295 @xmath290 as a function of our scattering rate @xmath117 is given in fig.1 where we have chosen the parameters @xmath156 = 1 , @xmath158 = 0 , k = 0.5 and k takes the values 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1.5 and 5 ( k = 1.5 gives exactly an abrikosov gorkov law ) .",
    "in order to conclude this section , let us now come back to the various terms we have omitted from the beginning .",
    "we did not take into account direct plane - chain scattering by impurities .",
    "as we mentionned , we expect physically this scattering to be reduced by a factor @xmath160 / @xmath296 compared to plane - plane or chain - chain scattering which we have treated . including this plane - chain term is just what is done in the standard two - band model when the effect of impurities on @xmath1 is calculated .",
    "since we have shown that our calculation lead us to the two - band model , including direct plane - chain scattering would just give us an additional term of the same order as the one we have found ( it would appear as an additional term in @xmath297 ) .",
    "therefore our conclusions with respect to the sensitivity of @xmath1 to impurities are unchanged .",
    "we have also omitted mixed plane - chain terms @xmath298 for the order parameter .",
    "this is justified by our finding that , when the hybridized bands are well separated , the dominant contributions of g come from the block diagonal parts @xmath299 and @xmath300 . hence we have for example @xmath301 = @xmath95 @xmath299 @xmath101 + @xmath102 @xmath300 @xmath96",
    ". however the products @xmath95 @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath96 are significantly different from zero only in the anticrossing region .",
    "when we calculate the off - diagonal self - energy , we have to sum @xmath301 over * k*. accordingly the result @xmath298 will be smaller by a factor of order @xmath160 / @xmath296 compared to @xmath252 and @xmath302 which justifies our approximation . finally we note that going beyond the born approximation will not only renormalize the impurity cross section .",
    "it will also introduce plane - chain terms @xmath303 in the impurity self - energy because , after scattering on a plane impurity , an electron can go to the chains through @xmath301 and scatter on a chain impurity .",
    "but we have just seen that , after summation of @xmath301 over * k * , one obtains a result which is smaller by a factor @xmath160 / @xmath296 .",
    "this leads to a @xmath303 which is smaller than @xmath304 or @xmath305 by the same factor and hence negligible .",
    "the conclusion of our study is that , in our model , the critical temperature is much less sensitive to impurities than it is in standard d - wave models .",
    "one basic reason is that we expect physically impurities to produce essentially plane - plane and chain - chain scattering .",
    "just as in s - wave superconductors , this scattering does not affect the critical temperature .",
    "on the other hand @xmath1 is reduced by scattering between parts of the fermi surface which have opposite signs for the order parameter , just as in standard d - wave . in our model",
    "this is due to plane - chain scattering .",
    "we have found that this scattering , whatever its origin , will be smaller by a factor of order t / @xmath306 ( that is hybridization coupling over fermi energy ) compared to plane - plane and chain - chain scattering . from the band structure calculations we expect this factor to be typically somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 .",
    "therefore the sensitivity of @xmath1 to impurities in our model is reduced by a similar factor , compared to the d - wave situation . in the specific case",
    "which we have studied in details and which reduces to the two - band model , we have found a further reduction of the sensitivity of @xmath1 to impurities with a behaviour which can vary continuously from s - wave like to d - wave like depending on the parameters . from our discussion of its physical origin",
    ", we expect a similar behaviour and reduction to occur in the general case .",
    "it is unfortunately not possible to make quantitative comparison with experiments .",
    "indeed it seems surprisingly quite difficult @xcite to avoid a magnetic character for substitutional impurities in ybco .",
    "naturally this occurs when the isolated impurity atom itself has a magnetic moment . but this happens also when a non magnetic impurity acquires a magnetic moment due to its interaction with the environment , as it is the case for zn for example @xcite .",
    "naturally an impurity with a magnetic character will produce pair - breaking leading to an abrikosov - gorkov like law in any model , in agreement with what is observed experimentally .",
    "hence these kind of experiments can not be used directly to eliminate theoretical models .",
    "nevertheless , after these words of caution with respect to a simple - minded interpretation of impurities experimental results , we note that the reduction of @xmath1 down to 13 k for 8% zn is obtained by an increase of the residual resistivity @xcite by a factor of order 10 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath307 / @xmath308 should be then of order 20 @xmath1 ( see below ) .",
    "this is much more than what is necessary to destroy superconductivity within a d - wave model according to the abrikosov and gorkov law .",
    "moreover it is useful to plot the results of ref.17 and ref.18 for the critical temperature as a function of the residual resistivity .",
    "this is done on fig.2 .",
    "it can be seen that the behaviour of some of our results found in fig.1 is quite similar to the experimental results ( we assume naturally that the residual resistivity is proportional to the scattering rate due to impurities ) .",
    "we have naturally enough adjustable parameters to fit them nicely .",
    "however such a fit would be rather meaningless because , in addition to the magnetic problem , the scatter in the data is rather important at low impurity content and the interpretation of the data for larger concentration is uncertain ( localisation effects which are not taken into account in our theory might play a significant role ) .",
    "if we turn to irradiation experiments , whether by electrons or by light ions , the interpretation is also not an easy one .",
    "it is known that high @xmath1 compounds have a critical temperature much more sensitive to irradiation than standard superconducting materials . however , although it is likely that most of the created defects do not have a magnetic character , we can not eliminate , from our knowledge on substitutional impurities , the possibility that some are magnetic .",
    "the experimental evidence is controversial in this respect @xcite .",
    "then there is some evidence that localisation effects might be important since a metal - insulator transition is observed in ybco under light ion irradiation , and there is no intermediate normal phase between the superconducting phase and the insulating one @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity to localisation is easy to understand because of the two - dimensional nature of the @xmath7 planes .",
    "localisation effects are not included in our theoretical study .",
    "it is also not clear at all that the created disorder can be considered as homogeneous @xcite since the resistivity measurements do not always display a sharp drop at the critical temperature .",
    "similarly one might expect that the defects created by irradiation are randomly distributed at the microscopic scale , but it is actually quite likely that the chains are more sensitive to irradiation than the planes .",
    "there is finally the obvious problem of having an experimental determination of the quasiparticle lifetime produced by disorder .",
    "measuring the increase in resistivity appears the best way to do it @xcite although it is far from perfect since , for example , it measures at best transport lifetime which we expect to be somewhat larger than quasiparticle lifetime .",
    "notwithstanding the above problems let us try to interpret the irradiation experiments with our theoretical model , just to see what comes out . from drude s law , with a typical resistivity of 100 @xmath309 cm at @xmath1 and a plasma frequency of 1.1 ev @xcite",
    ", we have a typical inverse lifetime @xmath310 / @xmath308 @xmath53 2 @xmath311",
    "since superconductivity disappears in d - wave when the inverse lifetime due to impurities is of order 2 @xmath1 we would expect that an increase of resistivity of 100 @xmath309 cm leads to the suppression of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds roughly to a decrease of @xmath1 of 1k per @xmath309 cm ( the ag law is essentially linear ) .",
    "the experimental results of ref.15 give a linear decrease of @xmath1 with respect to resistivity with a slope 0.3 k / @xmath309 cm .",
    "in ref.14 there is an upward curvature at low resistivity with a maximal initial slope of 0.1 k/ @xmath309 cm .",
    "since in our model a reduction by a typical factor 1/10 with respect to the d - wave result corresponds to a typical choice of our parameters , we see that this last experimental result agrees with our expectation .",
    "but the result of ref.14 could easily be explained for example by a larger value of the hybridization energy or by a suitable choice of the other parameters of our two - band model .",
    "quite generally we have enough parameters to vary in our model so we can get easily agreement with these various experimental results .",
    "however it must also be kept in mind that , as discussed above , there are other possible physical processes which we have not taken into account and which will add up to produce a faster decrease of the critical temperature with the resistivity .",
    "a clear example of this is found in ref.14 where a more rapid decrease is found for a set of samples and attributed to extrinsic effects , while good samples show an average decrease of 0.03 k/ @xmath309 cm .",
    "therefore we can consider an experimental result as an upper bound for our theoretical result , but it may quite well be larger than what we find .",
    "clearly it is more difficult to explain in a d - wave model the slow dependence of @xmath1 on resistivity found in ref.14 than it is in our model to explain the somewhat stronger dependence found in ref.15 .",
    "in conclusion we have seen that our model is quite coherent with the present experimental evidence .",
    "naturally , with respect to this problem of the effect of impurities on the critical temperature , it would be much better to have experiments providing stronger constraints on theoretical models , but this might prove difficult to achieve .",
    "let us vary eq.(9 ) with respect to the phonon frequencies @xmath45 and @xmath69 .",

    "the symmetric case @xmath156 = @xmath158 and k = k has @xmath277 = @xmath273 = @xmath156 - k , and is solved explicitely into two branches @xmath338 + @xmath265 and @xmath339 with the physical solution corresponding to the lower value for x. this degenerate situation is interesting to keep in mind , since the general case can be considered as resulting from the coupling of these two branches when one moves away from this particular case ."

    "<S> we have studied the effect of impurities on the critical temperature for a model of ybco involving pairing both in the cuo@xmath0 planes and in the cuo chains . in this model </S>",
    "<S> pairing in the planes is due to phonons , while coulomb repulsion induces in the chains an order parameter with opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> due to the anticrossing produced by hybridization between planes and chains , the order parameter changes sign on a single sheet of the fermi surface resulting in nodes in the gap . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in our model , the critical temperature is much less sensitive to impurities than in standard d - wave models . </S>",
    "<S> one reason is that impurities produce essentially plane - plane and chain - chain scattering , which does not affect the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is reduced by the scattering between parts of the fermi surface which have opposite signs for the order parameter , just as in standard d - wave . in our model </S>",
    "<S> this is due to plane - chain scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that this scattering , whatever its origin , will be smaller by a factor of order t @xmath2 ( that is hybridization coupling over fermi energy ) compared to plane - plane and chain - chain scattering . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly the sensitivity of @xmath1 to impurities in our model is reduced by a similar factor , compared to the d - wave situation . in the specific case </S>",
    "<S> which we have studied in details and which reduces to the two - band model , we have found a further reduction of the sensitivity of @xmath1 to impurities with a behaviour which can vary continuously from s - wave like to d - wave like depending on the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we expect a similar behaviour and reduction to occur in the general case . </S>"
