    "the present paper illustrates two interesting facts , namely :  ( 1 ) some important nanophysical systems , for instance quantum wells , can be understood with elementary quantum mechanics @xcite ; and ( 2 ) elementary quantum mechanics offers still unexplored domains , for instance the transcendental equations of eigenenergy . in fact , in almost all exactly solvable problems of quantum mechanics , only the schroedinger equation for the wave functions has an exact solution , but the transcendental equation for the eigenvalues can be solved only numerically or graphically .",
    "the attempt of finding analytical - exact or numerical - solutions for these equations is largely unexplored , even if it might demand sometimes quite elementary mathematics .",
    "so , there is plenty of room at the bottom - to use feynman s words in a different context .",
    "inter alia , in this article we shall undertake such an exercise - to obtain analytical solutions for the eigenenergy of bound states of a particle in a finite square well .",
    "of course , the issue of the bound states of a square well has a  long history , being discussed in about 40 papers , in the last six decades , to say nothing about textbooks ; for a review , see @xcite .",
    "until the mid 80s , the quantum square well was just a problem of elementary quantum mechanics , with applications in obtaining the energy levels of quasi - free electrons moving on long molecules or just below the free surface of a metal @xcite , or in the elementary theory of the ramsauer - townsed effect @xcite .",
    "the odd parity states of the 1d square well are in the same time the @xmath0 solutions of the 3d problem of a particle moving in a radial square well , the so - called deuteron problem , see for instance @xcite , vol.1 , problem 63 , p.162 .",
    "a more subtle application refers to ultrathin conducting channels in field - effect transistors @xcite .",
    "how this elementary problem became really important ?",
    "the impressive progress of experimental physics in early 80s made possible the fabrication of heterostructures and quantum wells @xcite , and the fact that the general principles of their physics can be easily understood , using the model of the `` particle in a rectangular box '' has been immediately exploited .",
    "the basic fact is that , in a very thin film , with planar surfaces , with mesoscopic or macroscopic longitudinal dimensions , and with nanoscopic transversal dimensions , the longitudinal momentum ( or wave vector ) of electrons is quantized according to cyclic boundary conditions , generating quasi - continuous values , and the transversal momentum ( or wave vector ) - according to rigid boundary conditions , generating quantized values ; the transversal quantum number depends on the film thickness .",
    "the transversal motion of the electrons can be described as a quantum square well problem. consequently , the electron spectrum is split in subbands , indexed by the transversal quantum numbers , with a quasi - continuous energy given by quasi - continous longitudinal momentum . as the transversal momentum , which depends on film thickness ,",
    "can not be larger than the fermi momentum , there is a connection between the film thickness and the fermi momentum . due to the fact that this connection involves discontinous and continous functions , via the transverse and longitudinal momenta",
    ", the physical quantities describing the system are characterized by functions with discontinous derivatives , or even with discontinuities .",
    "they produce an interesting physical behavior , namely quantum size effects ( qses )    in the last two decades , the ultra - thin metallic films where subject of intense investigation , especially due just to such qses , observed in such systems , consisting of an oscillatory behavior of the film stability [ wu2008 ] , of the lattice deformation @xcite , of the work function @xcite etc .",
    ", as a function of the number of atomic monolayers .",
    "the qses , predicted in the pioneering papers of sandomirskii @xcite and schulte  @xcite , are of considerable interest , from both practical and theoretical points of view .",
    "metallic ultra - thin films are especially relevant for ferromagnetic materials , being responsible for the giant magnetoresistivity observed in the antiferromagnetic superlattice @xcite . also , tuning the number of monolayers means , due to qses , tuning the work function , consequently tuning the chemical properties of the surface @xcite .",
    "this quite rich physics can be explained using a quite elementary formalism , considering , as just mentioned , that the movement of electrons in a direction transversal to the surface of the metallic film is quantized using the quantum wells theory .",
    "even the crude approximation of an infinite square well might be still useful , for instance for the calculation of the lattice deformation @xcite or of the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "these successes can be easily understood , due to the fact that , if the number of monolayers is not too small @xmath1 , the role of deep levels is dominant , and the difference between the deep levels of a finite well and the corresponding levels ( i.e. having the same quantum numbers ) of the infinite well is negligible . however ,",
    "if the number of monolayers is of the order of unity @xmath2 it is more and more inappropriate to approximate the levels of the quantum wells , i.e. the levels of electrons moving normal to the surface , with the levels of an infinite well .",
    "this is why it is important to obtain the exact values of the bound states for a well of an arbitrary depth , or reasonably precise analytic approximations of these quantities .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section 2 , we expose the elementary problem of the finite square well , discussing carefully the eigenvalue problem ; to find its solution means to obtain a set of functions , @xmath3 and @xmath4,corresponding to the even and odd parity states .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the so - called parabolic and cubic approximations for these functions . in section 4",
    ", we put the transcendental equation for the energy eigenvalue in a differential form , and obtain an exact series expansion for @xmath3 and @xmath5 the 3rd order approximation of this series - the barker s approximation @xcite - is discussed in the light of the exact and approximate solutions , as it is already used in several applications . in section 5",
    "we discuss the applications of our results , in three domains : ultra - thin metallic films , revivals and super - revivals , and electromagnetism .",
    "several concluding remarks are presented in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we shall present the quantum mechanical problem of a particle in a finite square well .",
    "there are in principle two ways of defining the potential of the well , namely taking the top of the well at @xmath6 or taking the bottom at @xmath7 in the first case , the advantage is that the bound states ( situated `` inside the well '' ) have negative energy - the typical situation for bound states , in quantum mechanics . in the second case ,",
    "the advantage is that , in the limit of a very deep well , the levels are close to the corresponding levels ( having the same quantum number ) of the infinite well .",
    "we shall examine in detail the first case , when the potential is :    @xmath8    and @xmath9 defines the heaviside function .",
    "the second case is briefly discussed later on , see eqs .",
    "( 32 ) , ( 33 ) .",
    "the schroedinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath10 moving in the potential ( 1 ) has the form :    @xmath11 \\psi \\left ( x\\right ) = 0\\    \\label{2}\\ ] ]    as the potential is invariant to space inversion , @xmath12  the solutions have well - defined parity .",
    "if we introduce the wave vectors @xmath13 via the relations :    @xmath14    and the dimensionless quantity @xmath15 which characterizes both the particle and the potential@xmath16    @xmath17    also ,    @xmath18    with this notation , the energy of the particle takes the form :    @xmath19 \\\\ ] ]    the even solutions of ( 2 ) are :    @xmath20    @xmath21\\ ] ]    @xmath22    and the odd ones :    @xmath23    @xmath24\\ ] ]    @xmath25    the explicit form of the normalization constants @xmath26 in ( 7 ) , ( 9 ) can be found for instance in @xcite and will be not given here .",
    "the energy eigenvalue equations can be conveniently written in terms of the wave vector @xmath27 .",
    "for even states :    @xmath28    and for odd states : @xmath29    with @xmath27 obtained from ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , the eigenenergy is given by ( 6 ) .",
    "so , to solve the eigenvalue equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) means to find the functions @xmath30 which satisfy the relations :    @xmath31    in order to clearly define the alternation of signs in ( 13 ) , we shall identify the intervals of monotony of the functions @xmath32 of course , the @xmath33 varaible used here and hereafter has nothing to do with the spatial coordinate , enterng in the schroedinger equation ( 1 ) and in its solutions.the extremum points of the function @xmath34 are given by the roots @xmath35 of the equation :    @xmath36    where @xmath35  is the root closest to @xmath37    @xmath38    the extremum values of the function @xmath34  are :    @xmath39    it is easy to see that the eigenvalue equations for the even states are :    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    and so on .    similarly , the extremum points of the function @xmath43 are located in the roots @xmath44  of the equation :    @xmath45    where @xmath44 is the root closest to @xmath46 the analogous of ( 15 ) is :    @xmath47    the extremum values of the function @xmath43 are :    @xmath48    the eigenvalue equations for odd states are :    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    and so on . each of the eqs . (",
    "17 ) - ( 19 ) , ( 23 ) - ( 25 ) has a unique solution , @xmath52 respectively @xmath53 for sufficiently small values of @xmath54on the aforementioned intervals , the functions @xmath55 are monotonous , and for their restriction on each of these intervals , an inverse function exists .",
    "these inverse functions are , in the aforementioned cases , @xmath56 respectively @xmath57 @xmath58 their plots can be obtained as symmetric of the restrictions of the functions @xmath55 on their intervals of monotony , given by eqs .",
    "( 17 ) - ( 19 ) , ( 23 ) - ( 25 ) .",
    "graphically , the functions @xmath59correspond to the intersections of the @xmath60coordinates of the plots of the functions @xmath61 with the line @xmath62 , on well defined intervals .",
    "the number of solutions depends on the value of @xmath63 there is always at least one solution @xmath64 for any value of @xmath65 , but the solutions @xmath66 exist only for @xmath67 in fig.1 , the plots of the functions @xmath43 ( plain),@xmath68 ( dashed ) and @xmath69 with @xmath70 are given .",
    "the @xmath60coordinate of the intersection point of @xmath71with @xmath72 for @xmath73 defines the function @xmath74 with @xmath75 , for @xmath76 , the function @xmath77 ; with @xmath72 for @xmath78 the function @xmath79 etc .",
    "similarly , the @xmath60coordinate of the intersection point of @xmath80with @xmath72 for @xmath81 defines the function @xmath82 with @xmath75 , for @xmath83 , the function @xmath84 etc .",
    "as already mentioned , a finite well only supports a fixed number of bound states . according to several authors",
    "( see for instance [ aronsteinajp2000 ] ) , this number is given by :    @xmath85    in other words , if we define :    @xmath86    for @xmath87 the well supports @xmath88 bound states , and for @xmath89 it supports @xmath90 bound states .",
    "this statement is correct in the approximation    @xmath91    i.e. when we identify the extremum points of the functions @xmath92 with those of the functions @xmath93 rigorously speaking , the situation is slightly more complicated , in the following sense .",
    "if @xmath65 decreases from @xmath94 to @xmath95 a new root , namely @xmath3 shows up , and this corresponds to the @xmath96-th bound state .",
    "similarly , if @xmath65 decreases from @xmath97 to @xmath98 a new root , namely @xmath4 shows up , and this corresponds to the @xmath99-th bound state .",
    "the @xmath100dependence of the coordinates of extremum points , @xmath101 , has been obtained by approximating the @xmath102 function in ( 14 ) , ( 21 ) with the first term of its taylor series expansion .",
    "an alternative way of finding analytic approximations for the roots @xmath101 is to use the algebraic approximation for @xmath103 indicated in @xcite .",
    "of course , this is only an example of the usefulness of this algebraic approximation formula , which can be also used , for instance , to solve the eigenvalue equation for a particle moving in an infinite rectangular well , with a @xmath104function barrier in the middle ; indeed , this equation has the form @xmath105 @xcite .    according to eq .",
    "( 6 ) , the eigenvalues of the energy are :    @xmath106    if we consider a particle which is moving not in the potential @xmath107 given by ( 1 ) , but in a potential    @xmath108    then the energy levels will be given by :    @xmath109    in correspondence to the parity of @xmath110 @xmath111 corresponds to the functions @xmath112 or @xmath113 for instance @xmath114 etc .",
    "in general ,    @xmath115    let us remind that the quantity @xmath116 defined in ( 3 ) can not be obtained putting @xmath117 in ( 29 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 32 ) .",
    "so , the eigenfunctions for the even states are :    @xmath118    and for the odd states :    @xmath119    as it has been already mentioned , the advantage of using the potential ( 1 ) consists in the fact that the energies of the particle `` inside the well '' , i.e. the energy of the bound states , are negative , which corresponds to the usual convention adopted in quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the form ( 30 ) of the potential has the advantage - also mentioned previously - that its levels become , in the limit of a very deep well , the levels of the infinite well .",
    "it is indeed easy to see that , for @xmath120 so for very deep wells , the quantization condition for the wave vector becomes @xmath121 so    @xmath122    and the eq . ( 31 ) becomes the equation of the energy levels of an infinite well :    @xmath123",
    "the parabolic and cubic approximations consist in approximating the restrictions of the functions @xmath55 on their monotony intervals , defined in section 2 , with segments of parabolas , or of cubic polynomials , having the same roots , extremum points and ( in the case of cubic polynomials ) slope in the root , as the exact functions .",
    "the detailed methods for obtaining these approximations have been indicated in [ vb - rrp ] , @xcite .",
    "we shall give here only the results .",
    "the parabolic approximation for the functions @xmath124 is :    @xmath125    also ,    @xmath126    they are defined on the intervals @xmath127 for @xmath128 and on @xmath129 for @xmath130 with @xmath131 for @xmath112 functions and @xmath132 for @xmath133 functions .    if the extremum points of the functions @xmath55 are approximated with the extremum points of the functions @xmath134the formulas ( 37 ) , ( 38 ) become :    @xmath135    @xmath136    and their intervals of definition change accordingly . as the formulas ( 39 ) , ( 40 )",
    "are sometimes referred to as simple parabolic approximation , we shall refer to ( 37 ) , ( 38 ) as improved parabolic approximation. this convention explains the upper indices in the definition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 functions , eqs .",
    "( 37 ) , ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) .    in order to introduce the cubic approximations for the functions",
    "@xmath137 we have to define the quantities :    @xmath138    and    @xmath139    using the notations :    @xmath140    the cubic approximation for @xmath141 is : @xmath142    similarly , defining :    @xmath143    and simply replacing the index @xmath144 by @xmath145 in ( 42 ) , ( 43 ) , we get the cubic approximation for @xmath146    @xmath147    the cubic approximations are defined on the same intervals as the corresponding parabolic approximations .    as @xmath34 , for @xmath148 can not be approximated by a polynomial , the root @xmath149 can not be obtained from the formulas ( 37 ) or ( 46 ) .",
    "the function @xmath43 for @xmath150 can be approximated by a polynomial , but can not be obtained from the general formulas , as the interval of monotony is not of the form used for the evaluation of @xmath151 with @xmath152 however , the same approach can be used , giving :    @xmath153    for the parabolic approximation ( in this case , the simple and the improved approximation coincide ) , and    @xmath154",
    "@xmath155    for the cubic approximation .    some caution is needed while switching from @xmath33 to @xmath65 dependence in these formulas .",
    "in fact , the parabolic and cubic approximations have been obtained in a pure geometric context , and the functions @xmath156 in ( 29 ) , ( 32 ) - in a dynamic context , so , in order to use these approximations in the eigenvalue expressions , we have to write @xmath157 the expressions of the cubic approximations for the functions indexed by @xmath158 are given in the appendix .",
    "we shall expose now a method of solving the eigenvalue equations , discovered and re - discovered several times , which generates an exact solution , in the form of a series expansion .",
    "as we shall see , the method works for a large class of transcendental equations .",
    "let us take the derivatives in both sides of the equations ( 17)-(19 ) and ( 23)-(25 ) , putting :    @xmath159    replacing @xmath65 by @xmath33 and relaxing the restriction @xmath160 the equations for the energy eigenvalues can be written in a unitary form :    @xmath161    with the initial condition :    @xmath162    it is remarkable that both the even , and the odd solutions , satisfy identical differential equations.the formula ( 50 ) allows us to obtain the derivatives of any order of @xmath163  in an arbitrary point @xmath164 and , consequently , to construct the taylor series for this function , with arbitrary precision . choosing @xmath165 , and putting :    @xmath166    we get the following exact series expansion for @xmath167    @xmath168    the first 6 functions @xmath169 are the following polynomials in the variable    @xmath170    namely    @xmath171    @xmath172",
    "@xmath173    the polynomials @xmath174 have the same order , @xmath175 we calculated quite a lot of such polynomials ( see the appendix ) with the expectation that this exercise could help to guess a general formula for its coefficients .",
    "however , the presence of some large prime numbers in the products which enter in the coefficient of polynomials @xmath176 , specially for odd indices , is somewhat discouraging for the attempt of finding general expressions for this quantities .",
    "the limit @xmath177 corresponds to the infinite well .",
    "it is easy to see , using ( 35 ) and ( 53 ) , that :    @xmath178    with    @xmath179    also , the energy levels of the semi - infinite well , corresponding to the limit @xmath180 in ( 30 ) , are given by :    @xmath181    numerical studies show that the series expansion ( 53 ) can be used only in a small interval near the origin ; its value in another point must be obtained constructing the series expansion near that point .",
    "this is why , for practical calculations , it is convenient to use various approximations of the exact formula .    restricting the series ( 53 ) at its first 3 terms ,",
    "we get barker s approximation @xcite :    @xmath182    barker s approximation has been used in several applications of the square well , for instance in the study of revivals and super - revivals .",
    "as given by its author , the approximation formula is :    @xmath183    @xmath184    with our notations ,    @xmath185    as barker s approximation is a consequence of the cubic approximation of the @xmath186 function , its precision goes up to the third order terms , so the terms not explicitly written in the r.h.s . of ( 62 ) must be omitted .",
    "in other words , the correct form of the `` barker s approximation '' is the polynomial form given in ( 61 ) , not the fractional form given in the original paper .",
    "we can check this property verifying that    @xmath187    and so on .",
    "such a property has any polynomial approximation of the exact solution .",
    "for instance , putting :    @xmath188    we get :    @xmath189    graphical and numerical considerations show that barker s approximation can not be used for @xmath149 and @xmath190 but is useful for any other case , being more precise for smaller values of @xmath63 the parabolic approximation can be used , qualitatively , for @xmath190 but is less precise than barker s one , in all other cases .",
    "the cubic approximation gives excellent results in all cases , excepting @xmath191 where de alcantara bonfim - griffith solution should be used .",
    "polynomial approximations of the exact solutions , higher than barker s , are useful only for small arguments , so barker s approximation can be considered as the most convenient polynomial approximation . for the illustration of these conclusions ,",
    "we give here the plots for the @xmath192 and @xmath193 functions .    in fig .",
    "2 , we can see how accurately the solutions @xmath194 and @xmath195 satisfy the equation ( 23 ) .",
    "the functions    @xmath196    are plotted with solid black , solid green and dotted black lines , respectively ; the function @xmath197 - with red .",
    "barker s approximation is unusable , the parabolic one - quite poor , and the cubic one - very good . in fig .",
    "3 , we check , similarly , how accurately the solutions @xmath198 and @xmath199 satisfy the equation ( 24 ) ; the conventions are similar , excepting the fact that instead of the function @xmath200 the function @xmath201 is plotted .",
    "now , the barker approximation is reasonably correct , especially for small values of the argument , the parabolic one is poorer than barker s , and the cubic one is very accurate .",
    "these conclusions remain valid for the higher orders of both @xmath202 and @xmath112 functions , with the remark that , in general , barker s approximations becomes quite poor for large values of the argument .",
    "maybe because the rectangular well is , from the point of view of advanced physics , an elementary problem ( even if , from the mathematical point of view , the eigenvalue equations for the energy are not at all trivial ) , it is sometimes underestimated , and several results obtained by various authors remained unnoticed , and re - obtained in other forms ; so , the domain has many repetitions and overlappings .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors use the same method as that just exposed here in order to find a series expansion for the solutions of the eigenvalue equations , but the expansion used by them , equivalent to ( 65 ) , is limited to second order terms . in fact , the precision of their research , which is focused on the physical properties of a mesoscopic film of thickness @xmath203 , does not request a better precision .",
    "however , this precision is inferior to the precision of the barker approximation which , as we could see , goes to third order terms .",
    "apparently , it seems that in @xcite barker s results are ignored , and re - obtain the series using a different method .    also , in spite of the fact that the equivalence of the sturm - liouville problems for electromagnetic waves and wave functions is well known since the early years of the quantum mechanics , the results obtained in the square well problem seem to remain unused by the researchers studying light propagation in waveguides or in other simple geometries .",
    "reciprocally , the very detailed analysis of the eigenvalue equations , very similar to that of a square well , used in the propagation of electromagnetic waves [ marcuse ] , where a number of approximate solutions have been proposed ( see for instance the references [ 90 , 92 ] in @xcite ) , seem to have remained unnoticed by people working in quantum mechanics .",
    "even if the infinite square well is a very crude model , it can explain satisfactorily many aspects of the physics of metallic thin films .",
    "this is not very surprising , as the energy levels of a deep square well are acceptably approximated , for large quantum numbers , by the levels of an infinite well .",
    "the approximation fails for the first ones @xmath204 but for a film with @xmath205 25 monolayers , the effect is not dramatic .",
    "the infinite well model has been improved , taking into account , in an approximative manner , the fact that the electron moving in the well can penetrate its walls ; this is the so - called phase accumulation model ( pam ) .",
    "the model is exposed in a number of papers , @xcite , [ milun2002 ] ,  @xcite ; concerning pam for a metal - semiconductor interface , see @xcite .",
    "however , even pam gives very inaccurate results for very thin films .",
    "the fact that both the infinite well model and pam are inappropriate for shallow wells ( for instance , in an 1 ml ag film , only a single qw state exists @xcite ) is discussed by several researchers .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors warn about the fact that we have to be very cautious when we apply the infinite well model to very thin films ; in fact , they find that the stability of a thin film of less than 5 monolayers depends sensitively on the height of interface energy barriers , ( see @xcite , p.6 ) . in the photoemission studies of qw states in thin films , reported in @xcite and [ chiang2000prb ] , the data for the first 3 monolayers are excluded from the fit , in a pam analysis .",
    "the angle - resolved photoemission is indeed an important tool for the study of electron states in qws .",
    "in fact , there is a close analogy between a standing electromagnetic wave propagating between two reflecting surfaces and an electron moving in a square potential well @xcite .",
    "the first case corresponds to the fabry - perot interferometer , which shows a set of peaks in optical transmission ; the second , to an electron confined in qw , formed in an ultra - thin metallic film .",
    "electron confinement within a film results in discrete qw states , observable by angle - resolved photoemission . for a such film of ag on fe , angle - resolved photoemission spectra",
    "are well explained by pam for number of ml > 2 , but fails for 1 or 2 monolayers .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so , the exact treatment of the finite well , or analytic approximations of the exact solutions are necessary for a correct description of the shallow wells ( presuming that the model itself is still usable in all ultra - thin films ) .",
    "our results can be directly used in the approach of  wu and zhang @xcite who apply the finite well model to the study of very thin films , but use numerical instead of analytical solutions . for freestanding films , where the electrons move in a symmetric square well of barrier height    @xmath206    the theory works without any adjustable parameter .",
    "the freestanding films are of great theoretical interest , as they can serve as reference points to see how substrates affect film properties .    for a film on a semiconductor substrate ,",
    "the film is modeled as electrons residing in an asymmetric well , so :    @xmath207    as @xmath208are comparable , @xmath209 and the eigenenergy can be obtained using the perturbation theory , considering the symmetric well as exactly solvable problem .",
    "the same remarks applies for an electron in a corrugated box , for instance if the corrugated periodic potential is ( @xcite , eq .",
    "( 29 ) ) :    @xmath210    with @xmath211    for solid - solid and solid - vacuum interfaces , the confinement potential is generally finite and rounded . examples of such potentials , for multilayered nanostructures , obtained using the dynamical mean - field theory approach , can be found in @xcite , sect . 3.6 .",
    "if this more realistic form of the potential has to be taken into account , its eigenstates can be obtained by simple perturbation calculation , from the eigenstates of the rectangular well .",
    "it is well known that the sturm - liouville problems in optics and quantum mechanics can be identical @xcite , @xcite , so the quantized values of the wave vector of the quantum mechanical problem correspond perfectly to the normal modes of transversal electric field in resonant cavities , wave guides or heterostructure lasers , so our solutions of the energy eigenvalues can be applied also in optics and electromagnetism .",
    "as it is well known , wave packets in infinite square wells produce revivals , and in finite square wells - both revivals and super - revivals . analyzing numerically the superrevivals in finite square wells , [ venugopalan1999 ] notices that the barker s formula :    @xmath212    ( actually , the first term of the barker s formula , obtained in fact by garrett @xcite ) is less precise for shallow wells , than for deep wells .",
    "this property clearly results from our analysis of exact and approximate solutions of the square well problem .",
    "the same approximation is used by @xcite however , no analytic result can be obtained in this way ,",
    "as the @xmath100dependence of the eigenenergy is qualitatively different in the two cases ( for the finite square well , the simple @xmath213 dependence disappears ) , and this difference is smeared out in the barker approximation .",
