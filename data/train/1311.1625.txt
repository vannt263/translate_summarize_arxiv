    "these notes are based on three lectures given at the 2013 cime / cirm summer school _ combinatorial algebraic geometry_.    the purpose of this series of lectures is to introduce the notion of a _ toric fibration _ and to give its geometrical and combinatorial characterizations .",

    "section [ lec2 ] discusses discriminants of polynomials .",
