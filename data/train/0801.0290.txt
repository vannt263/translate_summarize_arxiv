    "recent astronomical observations such as high redshift type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite , suggest the existence of dark energy strongly .",
    "although many researchers have investigated dark energy , its nature is still unknown . in the proposed models or the equation of state of dark energy @xcite , the cosmological constant",
    "can not be excluded @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the dark energy is equivalent to a cosmological constant @xmath0 , there rises again so called a _ _ cosmological constant problem__@xcite : the present value of @xmath0 is extraordinarily small compared with an inferred vacuum energy during the planck time . to solve this problem , it is natural to consider that @xmath0 decreases from a large value at the early epoch to the present value .",
    "many functional forms of @xmath0 have been suggested : for instance decaying-@xmath0 has been introduced as a function of a scalar field in the brans - dicke gravitational theory @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the universe under various models of @xmath0 which are included in the energy - momentum tensor has been investigated analytically @xcite .",
    "in addition , interacting @xmath0 with other kinds of energy has been also discussed .",
    "the vacuum energy of @xmath0 coupled with baryon could be ruled out , because baryon - antibaryon created through vacuum decay causes pair - annihilation .",
    "the produced high energy gamma ray flux is contradicted with the observations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the vacuum energy decayed into the photon could affect the cosmological evolution significantly .",
    "assuming that the ratio of the vacuum energy to the radiation is constant at the radiation dominated era @xmath2 , freese et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects on primordial nucleosynthesis and obtained a limit of vacuum to photon energy ratio , which is less than 0.07 .",
    "furthermore , it is pointed out that observational constraints from the cmb intensity put the limit on the ratio of the vacuum to the radiation energy to be @xmath3 @xcite .    from the thermodynamical point of view",
    ", the temperature - redshift relation is modified by including adiabatic photon creation due to vacuum decay @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological decaying-@xmath0 has been found to affect the cosmological evolution after the recombination @xcite . in models having @xmath0 terms as a function of the scale factor",
    ", the radiation and matter temperatures would be significantly lower compared to the standard cold dark matter model with a constant @xmath0 ( s@xmath0cdm ) @xcite : the molecular formation is occurred at earlier epoch by @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that in some parameter regions , the radiation temperature could become higher compared with the s@xmath0cdm model , which is found to be consistent with the observational result of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "related to the recent observations , the first star formation that occurred at the end of the _ dark age _ has been investigated progressively @xcite . in decaying @xmath0 models , using a cooling diagram , the first star formation was estimated to occur at an earlier epoch by @xmath6 with its mass @xmath7 @xcite . in the meantime , from an observational approach , the cmb polarization observed by the wmap satellite predicts via measured reionization redshift with use of the s@xmath0cdm model that a first object was formed around @xmath8 @xcite . since the cmb anisotropies give severe constraints on parameter regions concerning the cosmological evolution , we can also estimate the era of the first star formation in the decaying-@xmath0 cosmology using the cmb anisotropy .    in the present paper",

    "it can be seen that @xmath43 in d@xmath0cdm is lower compared to that in s@xmath0cdm . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the photon evolves as @xmath45 at the early epoch and the slope of @xmath35 against @xmath46 decreases due to the contribution of @xmath47 near the present epoch . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the opposite results are obtained .",
    "therefore , decaying-@xmath0 affects the thermal history at around the present epoch of @xmath49 and particularly after the hydrogen recombination era .    if @xmath50 and/or @xmath30 is very large , the solution with present @xmath51 fixed indicates that the total energy density becomes negative for some epoch of @xmath52 . as a consequence ,",
    "these parameters were constrained as @xmath53 @xcite . in our analysis , the photon temperature for large @xmath30 and/or @xmath54 becomes also negative at some epoch of @xmath55 . by excluding this kind of solution",
    ", we obtain the upper limits on both @xmath50 and @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tgamma ] ) : @xmath56 in the case of @xmath57 , we assume @xmath58 until the primordial nucleosynthesis epoch , @xmath59 , and obtain the limits @xmath60 on the other hand , for @xmath61 or @xmath62 , we find that @xmath35 becomes negative at some time of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we impose the two conditions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    in the d@xmath0cdm model , the cosmological term decreases from the early time to the present , because the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) becomes larger than the first one at the early epoch of @xmath52 . since the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) dominates near the present epoch , the @xmath0 term is nearly constant for low-@xmath1 .",
    "although cosmological models with the @xmath0 term have been tightly constrained from the luminosity - redshift relation of snia , effects on the expansion rate are negligible in the d@xmath0cdm model .    in the s@xmath0cdm model ,",
    "the ratio of the photon to the neutrino temperature is @xmath66 after electron - positron annihilation , because @xmath35 and @xmath67 evolve as @xmath68 . in the d@xmath0cdm model ,",
    "since a decaying-@xmath0 alters the evolution of the photon , the ratio of the photon - to - neutrino depends on time .",
    "nonetheless if we set @xmath66 at @xmath59 in the d@xmath0cdm model , the present neutrino temperature is lower than that in s@xmath0cdm as seen in the second column of table [ tab : temp_dec ] .",
    "although recent observational studies put constraints on properties of the cosmic neutrino background such as the neutrino species or masses ( e.g. @xcite ) , there is no observation about its temperature ( or the energy density ) .",
    "therefore , d@xmath0cdm seems to have no problems for the lower neutrino temperature .",
    "cmb temperature at @xmath69 was measured accurately by the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer of cosmic background explorer : @xmath70 k at 2@xmath71 c.l .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , cmb temperature observation at @xmath52",
    "are reported in literature @xcite .",

    "when @xmath30 and/or @xmath54 take a large value , @xmath35 in the d@xmath0cdm model is not consistent with the temperature observation .",
    "puy @xcite has put constraints only on the @xmath72 plane from the temperature observation of @xmath73 @xcite : @xmath74 these limits are obtained by comparing the observational temperature included @xmath75 error with the temperature given in eq .",
