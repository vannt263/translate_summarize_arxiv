    "the study of harmonic maps into singular spaces , initiated in @xcite , has reached a refined state ; beyond general existence and uniqueness theorems , there are regularity and compactness results in the presence of minimal regularity assumptions on the spaces involved , see , among many others , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "particularly detailed results are available in the case of maps of surfaces . in @xcite , kuwert studied degree one harmonic maps of closed riemann surfaces into flat , conic surfaces with cone angles bigger than @xmath0 .",
    "he showed that the minimizing maps can be obtained as limits of diffeomorphisms , and that the inverse image under a degree one harmonic map of each point in the singular set is the union of a finite number of vertical arcs of the hopf differential . away from this inverse image",
    "the map is a local diffeomorphism . in @xcite",
    ", mese proved the same when the target is a metric space with bounded curvature , in particular when it is a conic surface with cone angles bigger than @xmath0 .    in this paper , we study two main topics : energy minimizing maps from riemann surfaces into conic surfaces with cone angles less than @xmath0 , and energy minimizing maps from _ punctured _ riemann surfaces into conic surfaces with cone angles less than or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "we state our results somewhat sketchily at first , assuming for simplicity s sake that there is just one cone point .",
    "the energy functional is conformally invariant with respect to the domain metric ( see  [ confinvsect ] ) , so we state all results in terms of conformal structures , @xmath3 , on the domain .",
    "first , we have    [ mthm1 ] let @xmath4 be a closed surface of genus @xmath5 , equipped with a conformal structure @xmath3 and a riemannian metric @xmath6 , with a conic point @xmath7 of cone angle less than @xmath0 and non - positive gauss curvature away from @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a homeomorphism .",
    "then there is a unique map @xmath9 which minimizes energy in the homotopy class of @xmath10 .",
    "this map satisfies @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a diffeomorphism .    that @xmath13 is a single point is consistent with the work of hardt and lin on maps into round cones in euclidean space , see @xcite .",
    "second , we have    [ mthm2 ] let @xmath14 and @xmath6 be as in the previous theorem . if the cone angle at @xmath7 is less than or equal to @xmath2 , then for each @xmath15 and each homeomorphism @xmath10 of @xmath4 with @xmath16 , there is a unique map @xmath9 with @xmath17 which minimizes energy in the rel@xmath18 @xmath19 homotopy class of @xmath10 ( see ( [ relhtopyclass ] ) for the definition of relative homotopy class ) .",
    "this map satisfies @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "this problem is motivated by the role of harmonic maps in teichmller theory and recent work that extends classical uniformization results to the case of conic metrics on punctured surfaces .",
    "the uniformization theorems for cone metrics of mcowen and troyanov , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , recent work by schumacher and trapani , @xcite , @xcite , and unpublished work of mazzeo and weiss has shown that the role the hyperbolic geometry plays in teichmller theory is played by conic metrics in the punctured case . in the unpunctured case ,",
    "harmonic maps enter the picture in the works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , in the creation of various functionals and in the important parametrization of teichmller space by holomorphic quadratic differentials .",
    "this paper lays the groundwork for the extension of these results to the punctured case if the uniformizing metrics are conic , and makes available  in case the cone angles are less than @xmath2  harmonic maps of punctured riemann surfaces .",
    "the proofs follow the method of continuity , and accordingly the paper is divided into a portion with a perturbation result and a portion with a convergence result . in both",
    "we make frequent use of the fact that minimizers as in both theorems solve a differential equation ( see ( [ hme ] ) ) . to be precise ,",
    "let @xmath22 denote the space of smooth metrics on @xmath23 with a cone point at @xmath7 of cone angle @xmath24 ( see  [ metricssect ] ) .",
    "the ` tension field ' operator @xmath25 is a second order , quasi - linear , elliptic partial differential operator , arising as the euler - lagrange equation for the energy functional , which takes a triple @xmath26 of maps and metrics to a vector field over @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath28 . for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , in section [ uniquesect ] we show that a diffeomorphism @xmath31 subject to certain conditions on the behavior near @xmath19 minimizes energy in its rel@xmath18 @xmath19 homotopy class if @xmath32 .    the perturbation result is an application of the implicit function theorem to the tension field operator .",
    "fix @xmath29 , @xmath30 and a minimizer @xmath27 as in theorem [ mthm2 ] .",
    "the proofs rest mainly in finding the right space of perturbations of @xmath27 , call them @xmath33 , and the right space of perturbations of @xmath34 , call them @xmath35 , so that @xmath25 acting on @xmath36 has non - degenerate differential in the @xmath33 direction at @xmath37 .",
    "there are two not - quite - correct points in this last sentence .",
    "first , to apply the implicit function theorem , one needs to work with banach and not frchet manifolds like @xmath22 ; for a precise definition of the spaces we use see section [ setup ] .",
    "second , the map @xmath25 actually takes values in a bundle , specifically the bundle @xmath38 whose fiber over @xmath39 is ( some banach space of ) sections of @xmath40 , so in fact we do not show that @xmath25 has surjective differential but rather that @xmath25 is transversal to the zero section of @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 denotes conformal coordinates near @xmath19 , the linear operator @xmath43 can be written @xmath44 , where @xmath45 falls into a broad class of linear operators known as elliptic @xmath46-differential operators , pioneered and elaborated by r. melrose , and used subsequently in countless settings (  [ bcalcsect ] ) . for detailed properties of @xmath46-operators ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty we encounter is that @xmath43 is degenerate on a natural space of perturbations .",
    "following the example of previous authors , including @xcite , we supplement the domain of @xmath25 with ` geometric ' perturbations ; in our case , we add a space @xmath47 of diffeomorphisms of the domain which look like conformal dilations , rotations , and translations near the cone point (  [ setup ] ) .    as we will discuss in section [ bcalcsect ] , the natural domains for @xmath43 are weighted banach spaces @xmath48 , which for the moment should be thought of as vector fields vanishing to order @xmath49 near @xmath19 .",
    "in particular @xmath43 acts from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , and is fredholm for sufficiently small @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 denote its cokernel ( see ) .",
    "the leading order behavior of a vector field in @xmath53 near the inverse image of the cone point is characterized by the homogeneous solutions of a related ` indicial ' equation , c.f .",

    "if the cone angle is less than @xmath2 , then near @xmath19 @xmath60 for some @xmath61 and @xmath59 .",
    "this lemma is central to the proof of the main theorems , since an accurate appraisal of the cokernel is needed to show that the geometric perturbations described above are sufficient to give a surjective problem .    to prove energy minimization , both in relative and absolute homotopy classes , we use an argument from @xcite , in which the authors prove uniqueness for harmonic maps of surfaces with genus bigger than 1 .",
    "they show that the pullback of the target metric via a harmonic map can be written as a sum of a two metrics , one conformal to the domain metric and the other with negative curvature , thereby decomposing the energy functional into a sum of two functionals which the harmonic map jointly minimizes . in section [ uniquesect ] , we adapt this argument to prove uniqueness in the conic setting .    for fixed domain and target structures @xmath62 and @xmath6 , if the cone point of @xmath6 has cone angle less than @xmath2 , the harmonic maps in theorem [ mthm2 ] from @xmath63 to @xmath64 are parametrized by points @xmath19 and rel@xmath18 @xmath19 homotopy classes of diffeomorphisms taking @xmath19 to @xmath7 .",

    "we prove the following formula for the hessian of energy at @xmath77 . given a path @xmath70 through @xmath80 with derivative @xmath81 , we can define the hopf differential of @xmath82 by @xmath83 .",
    "we have @xmath84 we use ( [ ihess ] ) to prove the non - degeneracy of the linearized residue map near @xmath77 (  [ pertsection1 ] ) , and use this to show that in the cone angle less than @xmath2 case one can perturb in the direction of absolute minimizers as the geometric data varies .    in the closedness portion ( section [ closedsec ] ) , we adapt standard methods for proving regularity of minimizing maps to the conic setting .",
    "first , we prove that the sup norm of the energy density of a minimizing map is controlled by the geometric data ( see proposition [ loclip ] ) .",
    "this uses a standard application of the theorems of digiorgi - nash - moser and an extension of a harnack inequality from @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that if a conic metric is chosen on the domain , with cone point at the inverse image of the cone point of a the target via a minimizer from either of the main theorems , then the energy density is bounded from both above and below if and only if the cone angles are equal , and we work with such conformal metrics on the domain in what follows .",
    "control of the energy density near the ( inverse image of ) the cone points is insufficient , and to obtain stronger estimates we proceed by contradiction , employing a rescaling argument , and the elliptic regularity of @xmath46-differential operators , to produce a minimizing map of the standard round cone . we also classify such maps , and the map produced by rescaling is not among them ; thus the desired bounds hold near the cone points ( see proposition [ closed ] ) .",
