    "leptogenesis is a particularly attractive process for producing the baryon asymmetry of the universe , since it utilises the same mechanism that is able to explain the observed neutrino masses and mixing , namely the seesaw mechanism .",
    "considering type - i seesaw , the standard model is extended by including heavy right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos , @xmath3 , that couple to the lepton doublets via yukawa interactions .",
    "their @xmath4- and lepton - number - violating decay produces a lepton asymmetry , which is partly converted into the baryon sector by means of sphaleron processes .",
    "we assume in general the presence of 3 rh neutrinos , thus giving rise to a model that depends on 18 parameters .",
    "these split into the 9 so - called _ low - energy neutrino parameters , _ probed in experiments , and a further 9 describing the high - energy scale of the rh neutrinos .",
    "we relate these two sets of parameters via the complex orthogonal matrix @xmath5 parameterisation @xcite . by definition , _",
    "@xmath0-dominated _",
    "@xcite scenarios produce the observed asymmetry by the decay of the next - to - lightest rh neutrino , @xmath0 .",
    "the subsequent decay of the lightest rh neutrino , @xmath6 , produces a negligible contribution and , furthermore , acts to wash the asymmetry out .",
    "these models are particularly interesting because they naturally arise when conditions inspired by @xmath7 grand unification models are considered .",
    "indeed , in this framework the spectrum of the rh neutrinos is hierarchical with @xmath8  gev , @xmath9 and @xmath10  gev , hence leptogenesis is @xmath0-dominated . in the unflavoured case ,",
    "flavour interactions are neglected and rh neutrinos decay into a coherent superposition of flavour eigenstates .",
    "the final value of the asymmetry is exponentially suppressed by the unflavoured @xmath6 decay parameter , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hubble parameter and @xmath13 is the @xmath6 total decay width . only when @xmath14 is the model able to produce the observed asymmetry .",
    "a numerical analysis shows that this is realised in only @xmath15 of the parameter space .",
    "this picture improves by taking account of flavour interactions . considering that @xmath16-interactions are efficient for @xmath17  gev , and muonic ones for @xmath18  gev",
    ", @xmath0 decays in a two fully - flavoured regime @xmath19 , while the wash - out due to @xmath6 takes place in a three fully - flavoured regime @xmath18  gev . around the transition temperatures the behaviour can not be described by the usual boltzmann equations and a density matrix formalism must be adopted @xcite . avoiding these regions , the asymmetry produced by @xmath0",
    "is projected onto the flavour basis and the @xmath6 wash - out acts separately on each flavour @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , exponentially suppressing the asymmetry by the relative flavoured decay parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "this only requires one @xmath23 in order to have a successful model .",
    "this is found to happen in @xmath24 of the parameter space , showing that thanks to flavour effects the @xmath0-dominated scenario can represent a viable model of leptogenesis .",
    "some approximations are made : in particular , the presence of phantom terms and flavour coupling is neglected @xcite .",
    "the phantom terms correct the projection onto the flavour basis of the asymmetry produced by @xmath0 in the coherent superposition of @xmath25 and @xmath26 flavours .",
    "each flavour asymmetry can be regarded as a combination of a term proportional to the total lepton asymmetry and a term related to the different flavour composition of the lepton quantum states with respect to their @xmath4 conjugate .",
    "this contribution is commonly referred to as a _ phantom term_. a further effect , _ flavour coupling _ , introduces a correction when one considers that the boltzmann equations are coupled due to the asymmetries stored in the lepton doublets and in the higgs bosons . while the size of these effects has already been studied , we focus our attention on the size of the parameter space region where these corrections become significant .",
    "a numerical analysis reveals that for @xmath27 of the parameter space the phantom terms and the flavour coupling modify the final asymmetry by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry depends in general on the initial conditions . at the high temperatures required by this minimal scenario , it is possible that prior to leptogenesis some other mechanisms may generate a significant asymmetry .",
    "leptogenesis models able to wash out a pre - existing asymmetry @xmath28 , while producing the correct final amount , are said to satisfy the _",
    "strong thermal leptogenesis _",
    "condition @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this case is realised only in a two - stage process where the rh neutrinos adhere to the pattern discussed above , thus reinforcing the interest in @xmath0-dominated models . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath0 decays in the two - flavoured regime and efficiently washes out the @xmath16 component of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath6 , on the other hand , decays in the three - flavoured regime , separately erasing the @xmath25 and @xmath26 components of @xmath28 , while the produced asymmetry survives in the @xmath16 flavour .",
    "this translates into a set of conditions on the relevant decay parameters , namely @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "when the low - energy neutrino parameters are constrained within the current experimental ranges , our analysis shows that , in the no case , the strong thermal conditions can be simultaneously satisfied , without fine - tuning , only if the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath31 is sufficiently large .",
    "in particular , for small values of @xmath31 it becomes difficult to obtain a value of @xmath32 large enough to ensure the wash - out of a pre - existing asymmetry , while keeping @xmath33 small .",
    "it is then possible to place a precise analytical lower bound on @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this lower bound depends on the magnitude of @xmath28 and on the size of the entries of the orthogonal matrix @xmath5 , i.e. on @xmath34\\equiv m_\\omega$ ] .",
    "the larger @xmath35 , the more the seesaw mechanism relies , in order to work , on fine - tuned cancellations , rather than on the natural interplay between the electroweak scale and the higher , beyond the standard model , scale of the rh neutrinos . in general",
    ", the lower bound shows a characteristic dependence on the dirac phase , @xmath36 , and has its minimum for @xmath37 . for @xmath38 and a large pre - existing asymmetry , @xmath39 , at @xmath37 one",
    "gets @xmath40  mev at @xmath41 c.l .",
    "the lower bound is relaxed for lower values of @xmath28 and larger values of @xmath35 . in particular , for @xmath42 the lower bound disappears .",
    "our results are fully supported by a numerical analysis that demonstrates the analytical lower bound being saturated at the expense of a high level of fine - tuning in the seesaw formula and in the flavoured decay parameters .",
    "moreover , a statistical study of the @xmath31 distribution shows a clear peak around @xmath43  mev and rapid suppression for smaller values . in the aforementioned setup , more than @xmath44 of points",
    "are found for @xmath1  mev ( the value quoted in the abstract ) .    in the io case",
    ", tension exists between the smallness of @xmath33 and a @xmath45 that must be large enough to wash - out the pre - existing asymmetry .",
    "however , with respect to the no case , @xmath45 is easily large enough , even for small values of @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely , an analytical lower bound on @xmath31 holds for io only when @xmath46 and is therefore much looser than for no .",
    "the numerical analysis confirms again the analytical results , but now @xmath44 of the points are found for @xmath2  mev ( the value quoted in the abstract ) .",
    "it is important to stress again that these results rely on the need for a @xmath32 ( @xmath45 ) , in no ( io ) , large enough to efficiently wash - out the pre - existing asymmetry , while keeping @xmath33 small .",
    "this request becomes nontrivial due to the experimental values of the neutrino mixing angles , in particular to the suppression introduced by @xmath47 .",
    "it can be shown that , with our usual requirements @xmath39 and @xmath38 , there is no lower bound on @xmath31 for @xmath48 .",
    "the reactor mixing angle happens to be large enough to allow both itself and the dirac phase to be probed , but not too large to trivially satisfy strong thermal leptogenesis and remove any lower bound on @xmath31 .    in the coming years , experimental results of the neutrino mass measurements , especially from cosmology , may have the potential to test models of leptogenesis .",
    "a measurement of the sum of the neutrino masses can put a constraint on @xmath31 and , if the uncertainty is further reduced to @xmath49  mev @xcite , it will become possible to discriminate between vanishing and non - vanishing @xmath31 .",
    "recent analyses that combine the data from _ planck _ with the latest growth of structure measurements from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) have been able to give for the sum of the neutrino masses a value @xmath50  mev  @xcite , at @xmath51 significance .",
    "together with the measurements from neutrino oscillation experiments this translates into @xmath52  mev for no and @xmath53  mev for io .",
    "these values are quite high , but they serve as a strong hint at a non - vanishing absolute neutrino mass scale , which goes in the right direction for strong thermal leptogenesis . on the contrary , if new observation will measure @xmath54  mev , a very little portion of the parameter space will let strong thermal leptogenesis survive , at the expense of a high level of fine - tuning . hence ,",
    "future cosmological observations have the power to either support or severely corner strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "however , this is highly dependent on the ordering and therefore it is of the utmost importance that , in the next years , neutrino oscillation experiments solve the ambiguity between no and io .",
    "the former is in general a much more favourable case than io for a significant test , since it hints at larger deviations from the hierarchical limit ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "strong thermal leptogenesis introduces a theoretical request that is able to constrain the parameter space and provide interesting results on @xmath31 . in a reasonable setup ,",
    "favourable values of the absolute neutrino mass scale are found for no , @xmath56  mev and io , @xmath57  mev . in no a further analytical lower bound",
    "is found for natural choices of @xmath5 ( @xmath58 ) , while in io the analytical threshold is obtained only for @xmath46 .",
    "these constraints on @xmath31 allow the future cosmological observations , together with the determination of the neutrino mass ordering , to test strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "we conclude by highlighting that the link between cosmology and neutrino phenomenology can prove to be once again extremely fertile and rich of ideas that may shed more and more light on some of the major puzzles of modern physics .",
