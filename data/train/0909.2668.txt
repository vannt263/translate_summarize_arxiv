    "since the solar surface heavy - element content has been revised downwards by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ags05 ) , from @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gs98 ) to @xmath13 , the excellent agreement between standard solar model ( ssm ) predictions and helioseismology determinations of the solar structure @xcite has been seriously compromised @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between models and helioseismic inferences has prompted a number of authors to revise the physical inputs of ssms @xcite , and to question the revision of the solar abundances , particularly those of c , n , o , ne and ar whose fractional abundances can not be determined from meteoritic samples @xcite .",
    "very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter agss09 ) have done a complete revision of the solar photospheric abundances for nearly all elements , including a new 3d hydrodynamical solar atmosphere model with improved radiative transfer and opacities @xcite .",
    "the predictions from this 3d model have been shown to agree remarkably well with various observational constraints , including the atmospheric thermal structure as judged from continuum center - to - limb variation and detailed line profile shapes @xcite .",
    "the newly determined solar abundances lead to @xmath14 , higher than the ags05 value but still well below older determinations , e.g. gs98 .    in this letter we present a series of new ssm calculations using solar compositions from gs98 , ags05 , and the newly determined solar abundances by agss09 .",
    "all the models incorporate new refinements in the input physics , so that models presented here with the older compositions ( gs98 and ags05 ) represent updated versions of previous solar model calculations @xcite . for each model",
    ", we compare our results with helioseismological determinations of solar properties and also give the predicted solar neutrino fluxes . additionally , and motivated by the new agss09 composition , we determine the factor by which radiative opacities in the solar interior should be increased to solve the solar abundance problem following the scheme presented by @xcite .",
    "solar models in this work have been computed with a modified version of garstec @xcite that uses the nuclear energy generation routine _",
    "exportenergy.f_jnb ] .",
    "element diffusion in the solar interior is included according to @xcite .",
    "radiative opacities are from the opacity project , complemented at low temperatures with those from @xcite .",
    "specific sets of opacities have been computed for each of the solar compositions used in this paper ( see below ) . with respect to previous works , e.g. @xcite ,",
    "the changes in the input physics are : a revised version of the opal equation of state ( eos ) that corrects errors in the 2002 opal eos tables from @xcite ( our previous choice ) , and updated values of two important nuclear astrophysical factors , s@xmath15 @xcite and s@xmath16 @xcite , the latest determinations by the luna experiment .",
    "we have computed solar models using three different basic solar abundances .",
    "two models employ previous solar abundance compilations ( gs98 and ags05 ) and show small differences with respect to models with the same abundances presented elsewhere , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the changes originate from the use of the updated eos and cross - sections for nuclear reactions mentioned above .",
    "a third ssm has been computed adopting the new solar composition determined by agss09 .",
    "the most important results in this work are related to this model .",
    "the choice of the abundance scale ( meteoritic or photospheric ) deserves a short discussion . while agss09 find the average difference between photospheric and meteoritic abundances to be @xmath17  dex , a few elements relevant to detailed solar modeling show comparable or slightly larger deviations .",
    "this is the case for mg , ca , and fe for which differences between the two scales are 0.07 , 0.05 , and 0.05  dex respectively , photospheric values being larger .",
    "given the historical robustness and higher accuracy of meteoritic determinations of abundance ratios , and the present excellent overall agreement with photospheric abundances , we adopt for agss09 meteoritic abundances for refractory elements as the standard choice for our solar models .",
    "we also investigate , however , the use of adopting the photospheric values throughout .",
    "this is also consistent with the adoption of meteoritic scales in previous works on solar models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the abundances for the different solar compositions used in this paper are given in table  [ tab : compo ] , in particular for those elements entering the calculation of radiative opacities .",
    "models have been evolved from the pre - main sequence to the present - day solar system age , @xmath18 presented in this work can be found in http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/@xmath19aldos ] .",
    "the main characteristics of the models are listed in table  [ tab : ssm ] .",
    "the second and third columns give the present - day heavy elements to hydrogen mass ratio and the surface metallicity . from the fourth to the seventh columns we present quantities directly related to helioseismology : surface helium mass fraction @xmath20 , depth of the convective zone @xmath21 , and the average rms difference between model and solar sound speed and density profiles , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "columns eighth and ninth give the central helium mass fraction @xmath24 and metallicity @xmath25 at @xmath26 . finally , the last three columns give the initial composition of the models and the mixing length parameter .",
    "results for the gs98 and ags05 models are very similar to those presented in @xcite ; the improved eos leads to changes in the sound speed and density profiles about one order of magnitude smaller than the differences between solar models and helioseismic inferences , while changes in nuclear cross sections only affect predictions for neutrino fluxes that are discussed in detail below .",
    "helioseismically derived values for @xmath21 and @xmath27 and are @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite respectively .",
    "the gs98 model predicts @xmath30 with the right value compared to helioseismology , while the ags05 model shows a 15@xmath6 discrepancy .",
    "for @xmath31 the situation is analogous : gs98 value differs from the helioseismology determination by 1.8-@xmath32 while for ags05 the discrepancy is 5.5-@xmath32 .    for the ssm that adopts the newly determined solar composition agss09 , @xmath33 and @xmath31",
    "show some improvements with respect to the ags05 model , but still far away from the helioseismology values by 11-@xmath32 and 5-@xmath32 respectively .",
    "the slight increase in oxygen abundance ( 0.03dex ) and the larger change in neon ( 0.09dex ) contribute to enhance the opacity below the convective zone ( cz ) , deepening its inner boundary and decreasing the mismatch with the solar sound speed at the same time .",
    "this is illustrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig : cs ] where the relative difference in sound speed is shown for the models considered in this work .",
    "the peak in the profile of the sound speed difference , right below the cz , is @xmath34 for the agss09 composition , an improvement with respect to ags05 but still significantly higher than that for the gs98 model .",
    "the overall agreement with the solar sound speed , as derived by inversions and indicated by @xmath35 , is a factor of four times worse for the agss09 model than for gs98 . for the latter model",
    ", @xmath36 is almost unchanged compared to results from previous works .",
    "however , a detailed comparison of the sound speed profiles shown in figure  [ fig : cs ] with those presented in @xcite unveils some differences , more evident below @xmath37r@xmath38 .",
    "these changes are not related to the improved physics adopted in the new models , but rather the result of using better data for low - degree ( @xmath39 ) modes that penetrate the solar core ( see @xcite for details ) . in the same figure ,",
    "results for density inversions are shown in the bottom panel .",
    "again , the agss09 composition leads to an improvement in the agreement with helioseismology compared to the ags05 model , but still far from the results obtained for the gs98 composition .",
    "as already mentioned , meteoritic and photospheric abundances in agss09 agree with each other very well , but a few elements show differences that could have potential impact on details in the solar structure . to quantify this assertion ,",
    "we have computed an additional ssm using only the photospheric abundances given in agss09 , for which @xmath40 .",
    "the main characteristics of this model , identified as agss09ph , are given in the last entry of table  [ tab : ssm ] .",
    "compared to the model with the meteoritic abundances , agss09ph performs somewhat better in terms of helioseismological quantities as inferred from the results summarized in the table , with discrepancies with the measured depth of the cz and surface helium abundance of the order of 9-@xmath32 and 4-@xmath32 respectively .",
    "the sound speed and density profiles are shown as dotted lines in figure  [ fig : cs ] .",
    "the changes with respect to our standard agss09 ( meteoritic scale ) model changes are mostly due to the larger mg and fe photospheric abundances ( 0.07 and 0.05  dex , respectively ) that enhance the opacity in the radiative interior ; the fractional increase in opacity is larger than the fractional increase in the overall metallicity ( note the largest improvement in the sound speed , for instance , occurs at @xmath41r@xmath38 , the region where the contribution of mg to the opacity is largest ) .",
    "our results show that adoption of the photospheric scale gives slight improvements in the solar model predictions",
    ". however , since the uncertainties in the meteoritic abundances typically are smaller than the corresponding ones for the photospheric determinations the meteoritic scale is our preferred choice for solar abundances ( with the exception of the volatile elements that are depleted in meteorites ) .",
    "this is reinforced by the historical robustness of meteoritic abundance determinations .",
    "low - degree helioseismology ( @xmath42 ) can be used to derive seismic information on the solar core , particularly by using the so - called separation ratios as described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have used the separation ratios constructed with very precise frequencies of low-@xmath43 modes measured by the birmingham solar - oscillations network ( bison ) to constrain properties of the solar core .",
    "they showed the discrepancy in solar models constructed with ags05 composition extends all the way to the solar core and it is not just related to deficiencies in the modeling of the solar outer layers , in the convective envelope .",
    "here we compare the observed separation ratios to those computed for our solar models ; results are displayed in figure  [ fig : seprat ] .",
    "as with other helioseismology indicators , the gs98 model performs much better than the ags05 model .",
    "the adoption of the agss09 composition in the ssm has very small influence in the core structure of the model , as it practically overlaps the ags05 model .",
    "results for the agss09ph model closely resemble those from agss09 and , for clarity , are not shown in figure  [ fig : seprat ] . as discussed in @xcite , values of the separation ratios",
    "are closely related to the quantity @xmath44 integrated over the solar structure .",
    "differences in this quantity between models with ags05 and agss09 ( both meteoritic and photospheric ) compositions are very small and only present very close to the center ( @xmath45 ) and thus have a very small impact on the separation ratios .    solar neutrino fluxes for the models",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : neu ] .",
    "the new astrophysical factor @xmath46 @xcite is 7% larger than previous determination and it is responsible for the larger @xmath47be and @xmath48b fluxes of models gs98 and ags05 with respect to those published in @xcite with the same solar compositions .",
    "similarly , the somewhat smaller ( 7.6% ) @xmath49 value recently published by the luna collaboration @xcite leads to a proportional reduction in the @xmath10n and @xmath11o fluxes .",
    "the increase in metallicity in the agss09 solar composition , compared to ags05 , is only partially reflected in the changes of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "this is so because elements that more strongly affect the solar core temperature ( si , s , and fe ) have the same abundance in ags05 and the meteoritic agss09 scale .",
    "the increase by 0.09  dex in ne and by 0.22  dex in ar are the most important changes in abundances influencing the core temperature .",
    "this is reflected , for instance , in the @xmath50 increase in the @xmath48b flux from ags05 to agss09 .",
    "@xmath10n and @xmath11o fluxes , that depend almost linearly in the added abundance of carbon and nitrogen show larger changes ( of the order of @xmath51 ) due to the 0.03 and 0.05  dex larger abundances of these elements in the new agss09 abundances .",
    "differences in the neutrino fluxes between the agss09 and the gs98 models are of the order of 10% for @xmath47be , 20% for @xmath48b and 38% for the added @xmath10n and @xmath11o fluxes . for the sake of completeness we present the neutrino fluxes for the agss09ph model .",
    "the effect of the increased iron abundance is readily noticeable particularly in the larger @xmath48b flux compared to agss09 model and , to a lesser extent in the cno and @xmath47be fluxes .",
    "the possibilities that current and future neutrino experiments offer to constrain the solar core metallicity are beyond the scope of this paper and are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the agss09 abundances do not change the picture that emerged with the previous set of solar abundances , ags05 : ssms constructed with abundances derived from the most sophisticated solar atmosphere models and up - to - date atomic data conflict with all helioseismology inferences of solar structure .",
    "potential solutions to the solar abundance problem analyzed by different authors , none of them successful in restoring the agreement between ssm and helioseismology measurements , still face the same problems if the agss09 composition is used instead of ags05 . in this regard ,",
    "it is particularly informative the work by @xcite , which show in the @xmath52 plane the direction in which model predictions change when modifications in their input physics are applied .",
    "it is not a simple task to find deficits in the models that produce simultaneously changes in both @xmath53 and @xmath31 in the right direction , except for restoring the metallicity to a larger value , comparable to that of gs98 .",
    "quantitatively , however , the disagreement is less severe with agss09 composition and , motivated by this fact , it is worth taking another look at the opacity deficit induced by the agss09 abundances .",
    "we have done a similar analysis to the one presented by @xcite to check by how much opacities in the agss09 model have to be increased to recover the level of agreement with helioseismology that the gs98 model gives .",
    "we find that in the central regions the required change is @xmath54 ( 2% with agss09ph ) , very close to what @xcite found .",
    "the magnitude of the change increases smoothly outwards and reaches @xmath7 ( 12% with agss09ph ) at the bottom of the cz .",
    "this requirement is smaller by almost a factor of two than that found by @xcite , very likely because they used the s - model ( which used the higher @xmath55 from @xcite ) as their reference model and one with the ags05 solar composition , while we have used gs98 and agss09 ( see @xcite for a more thorough discussion ) .",
    "we note the required changes are much larger than differences found between op and opal opacities in the radiative solar interior .",
    "it would be interesting , as pointed out by @xcite , to find other observable implications that changes of @xmath56% in the radiative opacity at temperatures of a couple to a few millon degrees would have , independently of those from solar models .",
    "we have computed new standard solar models that incorporate the most up - to - date input physics , including the updated opal equation of state and the most recent determinations of the astrophysical factors for the important @xmath57be and @xmath58o reactions .",
    "we have used three different sets of solar abundances : gs98 , ags05 and the newly determined agss09 .",
    "we have found that the updated physical inputs have very little effect on the properties of solar models , both in terms of solar structure and in the neutrino fluxes .",
    "the most important results in this work are those from the model that adopts the new set of solar abundances , agss09 .",
    "the new abundances are determined by using an improved solar atmosphere model and atomic data , and a more careful selection of spectroscopic lines .",
    "the resulting solar metallicity is somewhat larger than that from ags05 .",
    "this is reflected in the helioseismological properties of the solar model .",
    "for the agss09 model , the sound speed and density profiles , the predicted surface helium abundance and the depth of the convective zone are still in conflict with helioseismology data , although the disagreement is less severe than for the ags05 model .",
    "still , results are far from the excellent match found with the gs98 composition .",
    "finally , we have found that if radiative opacities were to be modified to restore the agreement between solar models ( with agss09 composition ) and helioseismology , the required changes are @xmath59% right below the convective zone with a smooth decrease towards the central regions , where changes should be @xmath60% .",
