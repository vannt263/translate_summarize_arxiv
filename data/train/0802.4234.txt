    "quasars with prominent nitrogen emission lines at 1486   or 1750   are rare .",
    "a well known example is q0353 - 383 , a luminous quasar showing strong niv ]  @xmath01486 , niii ]  @xmath01750 , and nv  @xmath01240 emission lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that the unusual nitrogen emission in q0353 - 383 is likely due to high metallicity in the broad line region of the quasar ; the metallicity measured from line strength ratios involving nv , niv ] , and niii ]  is @xmath615 times the solar abundance .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) provides statistically significant samples to study these nitrogen - rich ( n - rich ) quasars . from a sample of @xmath7 objects in the sdss first data release quasar catalog @xcite , @xcite reported on 20 n - rich quasars in the redshift range @xmath8 .",
    "the fraction of n - rich quasars in their sample is about 0.4% . by comparing with other quasars",
    ", they found that the n - rich quasars tend to have stronger ly@xmath4  emission lines , and stronger but narrower civ   @xmath01549 and ciii ]  @xmath01909 emission lines .",
    "the two quasars with the strongest niv ]  and niii ]  lines in the @xcite sample have been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite discovered two quasars with strong niv ]  lines from a sample of 23 faint quasars at @xmath9 .",
    "they suspected that the high detection rate of n - rich quasars is due to the low luminosity and high redshift of the sample .",
    "the number of known n - rich quasars is still small , and most of their properties remain unclear , such as the uv / optical continuum slopes , emission line strengths and widths , and central black hole masses , etc . in this paper , we present 293 n - rich quasars at @xmath10 selected from the sdss fifth data release ( dr5 ) quasar catalog @xcite . in @xmath11",
    ", we introduce our sample selection .",
    "we measure various properties of these quasars and compare them with those of other sdss quasars in @xmath12 .",
    "a short summary is given in @xmath13 . throughout the paper",
    "we use a @xmath14-dominated flat cosmology with h@xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we use ew and fwhm to denote _ rest - frame _ equivalent width and full width at half maximum , respectively .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey using a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the imaging is carried out in five broad bands , @xmath19 , spanning the range from 3000 to 10,000   @xcite ; spectroscopy is performed using a pair of double spectrographs with coverage from 3800 to 9200  , and a resolution @xmath20 of roughly 2000 .",
    "the sdss quasar survey spectroscopically targets quasars with @xmath21 at low redshift ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 at high redshift ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "quasar candidates are mostly selected in @xmath25 and @xmath26 color space @xcite .",
    "an sdss object is also considered to be a primary quasar candidate if it is located within @xmath27 of a radio source of the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm survey ( first ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sample we use is from the sdss dr5 quasar catalog .",
    "the catalog consists of 77,429 quasars with luminosities larger than @xmath28 @xcite .    to find quasars with prominent niv ]  or niii ]  emission lines , we searched 25,941 quasar spectra with @xmath29 in the redshift range @xmath2 .",
    "the search was done by visual inspection of each spectrum .",
    "this step results in a sample of 380 n - rich quasar candidates .",
    "we then measured the rest - frame ew and fwhm for each detected niv ]  or niii ]  line as follows .",
    "we estimate the local continuum by fitting a power - law to the spectra at both sides of the line .",
    "after subtraction of this continuum , a gaussian profile is fitted to the line , and the ew and fwhm are computed from the best - fitted component .",
    "our final selection criterion of n - rich quasars is @xmath30  .",
    "this cut is chosen for the following reasons : ( 1 ) in most quasar spectra , the significance of the detection of a ew = 3   nitrogen line is greater than @xmath31 ; ( 2 ) the 3   cut is significantly larger than typical ew values for the two nitrogen lines ( see @xmath32 ) ; ( 3 ) @xcite used a similar selection cut .",
    "a total of 293 quasars in our sample meet this criterion , including 43 quasars with strong niv ]  lines and 279 quasars with strong niii ]  lines ( 29 quasars have both lines ) .",
    "table 1 presents the catalog of the n - rich quasars .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the name of each quasar , and column ( 2 ) lists the redshift .",
    "column ( 3 ) shows the sdss @xmath33-band magnitude corrected for galactic extinction .",

    "the full table 1 appears in the electronic edition of the _",
    "astrophysical journal_.    figure 1 shows four good examples of the selected quasars .",
    "figure 2 shows the rest - frame ew and fwhm distributions of niii ] .",
    "figure 3 compares the redshift distributions of the n - rich quasars and sdss dr5 quasars at @xmath10 .",
    "the distributions are consistent at most redshift ranges except for the ranges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 . at @xmath35 ,",
    "the higher fraction of the n - rich quasars is caused by the higher sdss quasar selection efficiency due to stronger ly@xmath4  emission in these quasars ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the lower fraction of the n - rich quasars at @xmath36 is likely due to the lower signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) of the spectra at @xmath37  .",
    "we detect 293 quasars with prominent niv ]  or niii ]  emission lines from 25,941 sdss quasars at @xmath2 .",
    "this is the largest n - rich quasar sample to date .",
    "the fraction of n - rich quasars is about 1.1% , significantly higher than 0.4% ( 20 out of 5600 ) found by @xcite , who used a similar ew selection cut in a similar redshift range .",
    "this is likely because detecting weak lines in spectra of moderate snrs is difficult for automated codes .",
    "based on repeated selections of n - rich quasars by visual inspection from a subset of 2000 quasars , we estimate that the completeness at @xmath30   is greater than 80% . in this section",
    "we compare various properties of the n - rich quasars with those of ` normal ' sdss quasars .      to analyze the emission line properties of each n - rich quasar",
    ", we fit a power - law ( @xmath38 ) to regions with very little contribution from line emission .",
    "the quasar spectrum was first scaled to its @xmath39-band magnitude and thereby placed on an absolute flux scale . after fitting and subtraction of the power - law continuum , we fit the following individual emission lines .",
    "( 1 ) siiv  @xmath01396 if @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we use a single gaussian profile to fit this line .",
    "( 2 ) civ  if @xmath42 .",
    "we use a single gaussian and double gaussians to fit this line respectively , and we choose the best fit .",
    "( 3 ) ciii ]  if @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the weak aliii@xmath44 line is often detected in the blue wing of the ciii ]  line .",
    "we use two gaussian profiles to fit these two lines simultaneously if aliii  is apparent , otherwise ciii ]  is fitted using a single gaussian component .",
    "we also note that there is usually a contamination from the weak siiii ]   @xmath45 line .",
    "we do not remove this contamination because the decomposition of the ciii ]  and siiii ]  lines is difficult and the strength of siiii ]  is minor compared to ciii ] .",
    "all models are visually inspected , and the emission lines severely affected by absorption lines are discarded from our analysis . the ew and fwhm are measured from the best fits .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "column 2 of table 2 lists the median values of ew and fwhm for each line .",
    "the median value of the power - law slopes is also given in table 2 .",
    "the slope is slightly redder than the slope in the @xcite composite spectrum ( @xmath46 ) . in most cases",
    "the spectral quality is not good enough to allow more sophisticated fittings as @xcite and @xcite did , or to allow reliable modeling of weak emission lines such as heii  @xmath01640 and oiii ]  @xmath47 .",
    "the ly@xmath4 , nv , and siii  @xmath48 lines are usually heavily blended , so modeling their profiles requires high quality spectra .",
    "we discuss their average properties in @xmath32 .    in the above analysis",
    "we do not consider the uv feii  emission that contaminates most of the uv spectral region .",
    "the most prominent feii   emission line complex is at 2200 @xmath49 3000    @xcite . at @xmath50  ,",
    "the feii  emission is weak , and does not significantly affect the measurements of strong emission lines . at @xmath51 , the strong feii  complex is moving out of the sdss spectral coverage , making it difficult to measure the feii  emission .",
    "however , fe abundance is of interest , and the feii / mgii  @xmath02800 ratio is important for understanding chemical abundances in quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we fit and measure the feii  emission for quasars with @xmath40 and @xmath52 .",
    "the modeling is done as an iteration over a power - law fit to the continuum emission and a model fit to the feii  emission using a scaled and broadened version of the feii  template of @xcite .",
    "the feii  template is broadened by convolving the template with gaussians with a range of sigmas . in the first iteration a power - law",
    "is fitted to the continuum windows . upon subtraction of this primary continuum",
    "fit multiple broadened copies of the feii  template are scaled to regions which predominantly contain fe emission .",
    "the broadened and scaled feii  template that provides the best fit is selected and subtracted .",
    "then another power - law fit to the continuum emission is performed .",
    "the iteration of the continuum and feii  fitting is repeated until convergence is obtained .",
    "see @xcite for the detailed process .",
    "all models are visually inspected , and poor fits ( due to low snrs or strong absorptions ) are discarded from our analysis .",
    "after the subtraction of the feii  emission and power - law continuum we fit the mgii  line using a gaussian profile and measure its ew and fwhm from the best fit .",
    "we calculate the flux of the feii  complex by integrating the best - fitting feii  template from 2200 to 3090   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the results are shown in table 1 , and their mean values are shown in table 2 . the mean value of the feii / mgii  ratios is 3.6 with a scatter 1.3 , consistent with previous measurements in normal quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      to find differences between n - rich quasars and ` normal ' quasars",
    ", we draw a quasar sample three times larger than the sample of the n - rich quasars from the sdss dr5 quasar catalog by random selection .",
    "the sample has @xmath33-band magnitudes brighter than 20.1 and redshift distribution similar to that of the n - rich sample shown in figure 3 .",
    "we measure continuum and emission line properties for this sample using the methods outlined in @xmath53 .",
    "the results are given in column 3 of table 2 .",
    "the comparison in table 2 shows that most of the properties in the two samples are very consistent , including the continuum slopes , the feii / mgii  ratios , and the ews and fwhm of most emission lines .",
    "the only apparent difference is the fwhm of civ  and ciii ] ; their values in the n - rich sample is about 2530% smaller than those in the sdss dr5 sample .",
    "this was also noticed by @xcite .",
    "we compare the luminosity distributions of the two quasar samples .",
    "we measure @xmath54 , the apparent ab magnitude at rest - frame 2500  , based on @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the monochromatic flux density ( in units of @xmath57 ) at rest - frame 2500  .",
    "the flux density @xmath56 is derived using the best - fitted continuum .",
    "we then determine the absolute magnitude @xmath58 from @xmath54 .",
    "we find that the distributions of @xmath58 for the two samples are similar , although the n - rich sample is about 0.5 magnitude brighter on average .",
    "this is caused by our selection ; we may have missed some faint n - rich quasars where snrs are low and nitrogen lines are difficult to identify . however , the difference of 0.5 magnitude is too small for the baldwin effect @xcite to impact the comparison of the ews .    to compare the overall properties of continua and emission lines , we construct composite spectra for the two samples .",
    "each spectrum is placed in the rest frame and scaled so that its continuum at 1450   is equal to 1 ( arbitrary units ) .",
    "the scaled spectra are then averaged without any weights .",
    "this is to avoid bias introduced by the baldwin effect if we use weights involving snrs .",
    "the two composite spectra are shown in figure 4 .",
    "they have similar shapes from 1000 to 3000  . by definition the niv ]  and niii ]  lines in the n - rich spectrum are stronger . in the sdss dr5 spectrum ,",
    "the ews of niii ]  is @xmath59  , consistent with @xmath60   in the @xcite composite spectrum ; the ews of niv ]  is @xmath61  , consistent with no detection .",
    "we measure the properties of ly@xmath4  and nv  as follows . after the subtraction of the power - law continuum",
    ", we fit the ly@xmath4 , nv , and siii  lines simultaneously using four gaussian profiles , with the first two profiles representing the broad and narrow components of ly@xmath4  and the last two profiles representing nv  and siii .",
    "for ly@xmath4 , we only fit its red half side and mirror the fit around the peak for the ew and fwhm measurements .",
    "the ews and fwhm for the lines are determined using the methods described in @xmath53 .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "errors in these measurements are negligible owing to the high snrs of the composite spectra . compared to normal quasars , the n - rich quasars have @xmath62% stronger ly@xmath4  and nv  emission , and @xmath63% stronger oi  @xmath01304 emission . their civ  and ciii ]  line widths are 2025% smaller , as we find in @xmath53 .",
    "the radio - loud fraction ( rlf ) of optically - selected quasars is a strong function of redshift and optical luminosity .",
    "we calculate the rlf for our n - rich sample following @xcite .",
    "radio loudness @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the observed flux density at rest - frame 6 cm derived from first ( if detected ) assuming a power - law slope of @xmath67 . when quasars with @xmath68 are defined as radio - loud ,",
    "first is able to detect radio - loud quasars down to @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "we find that the rlf in the niii]-rich quasars is 26% and in the niv]-rich quasars is 69% .",
    "the rlf in quasars with both niv ]  and niii]lines even reaches 80% , significantly higher than the rlf @xmath5% found in normal sdss quasars with similar redshift and luminosity @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the niv ]  and niii ]  emission in these quasars are related to the quasar radio properties .",
    "central black hole masses of quasars can be estimated using mass scaling relations based on broad emission line widths and continuum luminosities .",
    "the scaling relations are written as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is optical luminosity and @xmath72 .",
    "strong emission lines such as mgii  and civ  have been widely used to determine black hole masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the similar luminosities and fwhm of mgii  in table 2 , the black hole masses in the two quasar subsets are consistent .",
    "photoionization models have shown that a series of emission - line ratios can be used to estimate gas metallicity in the broad line region of quasars @xcite . in particular , the relative nitrogen abundance is a good metallicity indicator if it serves as a secondary element so that n / o@xmath73o / h . by definition ,",
    "n - rich quasars have much stronger niv ]  or niii ]  emission .",
    "they also have stronger ly@xmath4  and nv  emission .",
    "since nv , niv ] , and niii ]  have a range of critical densities and ionization parameters , stronger nv , niv ] , and niii ]  emission shows higher nitrogen abundance , and higher metallicities if the relation n / o@xmath73o / h holds in these quasars .",
    "for example , a @xmath62% stronger nv / civ  ratio in n - rich quasars in table 2 indicates a @xmath62% higher metallicity according to @xcite .",
    "however , the strengths of most other emission lines in n - rich quasars are similar to those in normal quasars , and thus the metallicities measured from line ratios other than nitrogen @xcite would be consistent for the two samples , which is contrary to the results from nitrogen .",
    "therefore , stronger nv , niv ] , and niii ]  emission in n - rich quasars may not indicate a higher overall metallicity ; instead , it simply means a larger nitrogen abundance .",
    "the nitrogen enrichment in these quasars could significantly deviate from the usual n / o@xmath73o / h scaling .",
    "we have obtained a sample of 293 sdss quasars with strong niv ]  or niii ]   emission lines at @xmath10 .",
    "the fraction of n - rich quasars is about 1.1% .",
    "the comparison between these n - rich quasars and normal quasars shows that the two quasar subsets have similar : ( 1 ) redshift and luminosity distributions ; ( 2 ) uv continuum slopes ; ( 3 ) line strengths and widths for most emission lines ; and ( 4 ) central black hole masses . however , the n - rich quasars have : ( 1 ) @xmath62% stronger ly@xmath4  and nv  emission",
    ". strong nitrogen emission in all ionization states indicates high overall nitrogen abundances .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath74% narrower widths of the civ  and ciii ]  lines ; and ( 3 ) a much higher rlf .",
    "almost all the quasars with both niv ]  and niii ]  lines are radio - loud .",
    "the most intriguing difference between the two quasar subsets is the much higher rlf of n - rich quasars .",
    "we notice that q0353 - 383 is also a radio - loud quasar with @xmath75 based on the optical observation of @xcite and the radio observation of @xcite .",
    "also the niv ]  and niii ]  lines are rarely seen in normal galaxies , but they seem more common in luminous radio galaxies with agn signatures .",
    "for example , the two lines were detected at @xmath76 significance in 67% radio galaxies in the sample of @xcite .",
    "all these results indicate that the nitrogen abundance is tightly related to quasar radio properties : perhaps the high nitrogen abundance in n - rich quasars is an indicator of a special quasar evolution stage , in which the radio activity is also very strong . detailed models , which are beyond the scope of this letter , have to explain all the distinguishing    we acknowledge support from nsf grant ast-0307384 , a sloan research fellowship and a packard fellowship for science and engineering ( lj , xf ) .",
