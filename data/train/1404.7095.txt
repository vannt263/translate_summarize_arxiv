    "the supermassive black holes at the centers of the milky way ( sgr a * ) and the giant elliptical galaxy m87 , present the largest apparent event horizons ( by nearly an order of magnitude ) from the earth . the characteristic angular scale for a black hole is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gravitational constant and @xmath4 is the speed of light , resulting in an angular scale of @xmath5 for sgr a * , where we have adopted a mass of @xmath6 and a distance of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the angular size of m87 is less clear at present , depending upon its mass which is a subject of some debate .",
    "recent stellar dynamics observations imply a mass of @xmath8  @xcite , which at an assumed distance of 17.9  mpc implies an angular scale of @xmath9 , and the value we adopt fiducially here . however , the gas - dynamical mass estimate is @xmath10  @xcite , a factor of roughly two lower , implying a correspondingly smaller angular size .    around a black hole ,",
    "a dark region silhouetted against a backdrop of bright optically thin emission ( known as a `` black hole shadow '' ) is predicted by general relativistic lensing  .",
    "while the emission region depends on the details of the underlying accretion process and of the emission mechanisms , the shadow feature is nearly independent of the spin or orientation of the black hole to within 10% , making possible a direct test for the presence of a horizon  @xcite . for a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "the shadow diameter is @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "these scales are now accessible to the event horizon telescope ( eht ) with @xmath12030@xmath0as resolution ( @xmath12 ) and therefore allow horizon scale imaging for the first time , providing a great opportunity to improve our understanding of the physics responsible for accretion and emission in a strong gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "the timescale for the keplerian motion at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around the black hole in sgr a * ranges from 30 minutes for a nonrotating black hole to 4 minutes for prograde orbits around a maximally rotating black hole  @xcite .",
    "these time scales are much less than the typical duration of a vlbi experiment , which violates one of the basic requirements for vlbi earth - rotation aperture synthesis imaging . however , m87 s much larger black hole mass results in a minimal time scale of a few days at the last stable orbit , making it a practical target for direct imaging on event horizon scales .",
    "furthermore , m87 drives a powerful relativistic jet , allowing the study of jet - launching physics .",
    "horizon - scale imaging promises to elucidate many persistent uncertainties in the jet formation process  @xcite , including in particular : measuring the rate at which astrophysical jets accelerate and collimate ; identifying where the material that mass loads the jet originates ; verification of strong , ordered magnetic fields ; and unambiguously determining the location of the black hole relative to the larger - scale jet structures via the observation of the black hole shadow  ( cf .",

    "in this paper we employ a class of simple models of m87 to assess the detectability of horizon - scale structure with the eht by focusing on the comparison of images at wavelengths of 1.3 mm and 0.87 mm ( 230 ghz and 345 ghz ) . section  [ sect : models_methods ] describes the jet models of m87 , observation simulations and the imaging method . in section",
    "[ sect : results ] , we report our findings , discuss their implications .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sect : summ ] .",
    "m87 exhibits a prominent relativistic jet detected on a variety of scales and across the spectrum , from radio wavelengths to x - rays  @xcite . because the eht now provides access to r@xmath13-scale structure for m87 , modeling the jet in this source requires inclusion of strong general - relativistic effects that lead to horizon scale signatures .",
    "here we employ a version of the jet model developed in  @xcite that produces sub - horizon emission structure .",
    "we direct the reader to this source for details , restricting ourselves here to a summary of its salient features and motivations .",
    "the high luminosity of agn derive from conversion of gravitational energy to radiation in the deep potential well of central supermassive black holes  .",
    "it is widely believed that agn jets are the result of the extraction of rotational energy via large - scale electromagnetic fields near supermassive black holes  @xcite .",
    "less clear is the reservoir of rotational energy being tapped .",
    "most often , the spin of rapidly rotating black holes is implicated in the formation of the highly collimated , relativistic jets observed at large distances from agn  @xcite .",
    "recent simulations have demonstrated that such objects are capable of generating the high kinetic luminosities observed  @xcite .",
    "however , a number of authors have also speculated that the radio jet observed near the core of m87 may be due to a disk wind , which both serves to collimate the nascent jet and is illuminated by the copious particles present launched from the disk itself  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the mechanism responsible for forming the jet , a canonical jet structure has emerged from jet formation simulations .",
    "this consists of a force - free interior , where the electromagnetic energy density greatly exceeds that associated with any entrained particles , surrounded by a collimating , magnetically dominated wind , where magnetic pressure is large in comparison to that of the gas .",
    "supporting both is a hot , geometrically thick accretion flow , responsible for providing the currents that support and confine the magnetic flux near the horizon .",
    "motivated by the dominance of the total flux by the radio jet at large radii , we model the jet in m87 solely in terms of the first of these , the fast force - free jet core . in this sense",
    ", we consider a maximally pessimistic model for imaging the black hole silhouette , since the majority of the emission is produced in regions flowing outward , potentially relativistically .",
    "the global structure of the magnetic field and outflow velocities are obtained from an approximate solution to the equations of stationary , axisymmetric force - free electrodynamics , as described in detail within  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an asymptotic lorentz factor , @xmath14 , is introduced by reducing the toroidal magnetic field from the expressions presented in  @xcite by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to changing the pitch angle of the magnetic field lines in the equatorial plane , and would physically result from a mass loading of the magnetic field lines . here",
    "@xmath16 , consistent with the observed proper motions of the optical knots at large distances  ( e.g. , hst-1 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice",
    "this makes a small difference to image morphologies .    in the presence of dynamically strong magnetic fields",
    ", self - absorbed synchrotron emission provides a natural mechanism for producing the observed radio emission .",
    "this necessarily requires a population of energetic particles , which we assume arise in the form of a nonthermal , power - law distribution of leptons , supplemented with a lower energy cutoff , as described in  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the spectrum of m87 above 1  mm , we assume an electron energy distribution with power - law index @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , corresponding to an optically thin spectral index @xmath19 by adopting a negative sign convention ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "existing jet formation simulations are unable to provide strong guidance on the origin of these relativistic leptons .",
    "variations in the details of the particle loading models are largely responsible for the differences in horizon - resolving images published to date  ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in the case of m87 , where typical magnetic field strengths are of order 100300  g , the synchrotron cooling timescale is large in comparison to the outflow time , implying that nonthermal population is essentially conserved on the scales of interest , greatly simplifying its modeling .",
    "we parameterize the particle acceleration process by imposing a particle loading radius , below which the nonthermal particle density is essentially flat , and above which it is conserved .",
    "given both the intrinsic uncertainty in the location of the load radius , and the likely variability of the particle acceleration process , we allow this to vary .",
    "where a fiducial value is required , we chose @xmath21 . since the jet both collimates and accelerates , moving the load radius up and down modifies the visibility of black hole shadow , cast against the emission from the counter - jet .",
    "we performed simulations of eht observations at 230 and 345ghz using the maps ( mit array performance simulator ) package .",
    "the simulated sky brightness distribution was first converted into the visibility plane using an fft .",
    "all images ( 100@xmath22100 pixels in size and a pixel scale of 1.8@xmath0as ) were zero - padded prior to computing the fourier transform to allow interpolation in the fourier domain .",
    "visibilities were then `` observed '' based on the input array geometry ( site locations ) , antenna properties , source positions , and observation specifications ( e.g. , bandwidth , integration time , and scan lengths ) to produce synthetic data including thermal noise .",
    "maps samples a two dimensional - patch in the _ uv _ plane over the prescribed ( channelized ) bandwidth and ( divided ) integration time and interpolates and integrates numerically the data in the frequency and time plane to generate a complex visibility  @xcite .",
    "samples on the _ uv _ tracks were calculated for a 12s integration time .",
    "typical atmospheric coherence times at 230 ghz are 10s , but can be as short as 24s and as long as 20s depending on weather conditions at each observing site  @xcite .",
    "weather requirement at 345ghz is more challenging , but most eht sites have suitable observing conditions in winter times . at the alma site , for example",
    ", the measured coherence time is @xmath2316 and @xmath238s for 50% of the time at 230 and 345ghz , but it will be @xmath23 53 and @xmath2325s for the 25% best conditions , which is approximately equal to the night - time median coherence time  @xcite .",
    "we assumed perfect phase coherence within the integration time . in practice",
    ", visibility amplitude and phase information can be measured in terms of incoherently averaged quantities and coherence losses due to atmospheric turbulence are corrected using established algorithms tailored for high frequency observations  @xcite .",
    "amplitude calibration will be critical , as systematic errors on measured baseline flux densities reduce the imaging sensitivity . here , we do not include flux density calibration errors , but will consider these effects in future work .",
    "we note , however , future experiments with improved observation and calibration strategies ( e.g. , inclusion of amplitude calibrators , observing with paired antennas ) and with enhanced capabilities in imaging algorithms ( e.g. , integration of closure amplitude information ) are expected to largely remove systematic uncertainties in amplitude calibration .",
    "the simulations reported here are restricted to telescope elevations above 15 degrees , where calibration issues are expected to be reduced .",
    "we have primarily assumed an overall bandwidth of 4ghz at 230ghz and 16ghz at 345ghz , but we also consider the effects of changing bandwidth on imaging in the following sections .",
    "the assumed bandwidths would in practice be 2 and 8ghz in each of two polarizations and correspond to bit rates of 16 and 64gbit s@xmath24 for four - level signals sampled at the nyquist rate .",
    "a 16gbit s@xmath24 data - recording system has recently been demonstrated  @xcite and a maximum data rate of 64gbit s@xmath24 data rate is targeted for the alma beam former  @xcite . for high frequency vlbi observations , these bandwidths are relatively small ( 2% and 5% fractional bandwidth at 230 and 345 ghz ) , so the source structure across each of the two frequency bands were neglected .    the assumed array at 230ghz consisted of stations at 8 different sites : hawaii , consisting of one or more of the jcmt and sma phased together into a single aperture ; the arizona radio observatory submillimeter telescope ( smt ) on mount graham ; the carma site in california ; the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) on sierra negra , mexico ; the phased atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) ; the institut de radioastronomie millimtrique ( iram ) 30 m telescope on pico veleta ( pv ) , spain ; the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) , phased together as a single aperture ; and the greenland telescope ( glt ) .",
    "at 345ghz , we do not include the carma site in california .",
    "details of existing telescopes that may serve as participating stations in the eht array are discussed in  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "m87 provides us with a unique opportunity for understanding and testing the black hole physics and astrophysical processes in relativistic jet formation , collimation , and propagation with the eht . with well - established algorithms tailored for the eht",
    ", we have shown that the eht is able to image the black hole shadow with limited data sampled in the fourier domain .",
    "we have explored the dependence of jet structure upon the variation of the jet load radius and have shown that jet base activity in the vicinity of the black hole in m87 can be monitored with the eht telescope . the expected structural variation time scale on these scales ( a few @xmath25 )",
    "is well - matched with the duration of vhe flare activities .",
    "our simulations indicate that minimum necessary requirements need to be met for clearly detecting the black hole shadow and studying event - horizon - scale jet launching in m87 .",
    "the emission from the counter jet has to be sufficient for the black hole to cast a jet against , which in the context of the considered jet model corresponds to a load radius of @xmath26 11 m. to obtain sufficient resolution and sensitivity , the phased alma has to be included in the array with bandwidth@xmath22coherence time @xmath27 4ghz@xmath2212 s at 230 ghz and more stringent sensitivity requirement at 345ghz . with the full array ,",
