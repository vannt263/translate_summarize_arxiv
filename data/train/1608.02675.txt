    "<S> in fact , the problem is known to be np - hard  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not surprisingly , the characterization of entangled states is an equally difficult task . </S>",
    "<S> that is , to quantify the amount of entanglement within a quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> the answer to this question is practically very important , because it tells us how well our protocols will perform using a given state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent work by buscemi  @xcite has introduced a new way to think about entanglement detection  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to map the problem onto a modified class of nonlocal games , called semiquantum nonlocal games ( sqnlgs ) . in any such game , two players ( alice and bob ) share a possibly entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> a referee ( charlie ) starts asking them quantum questions by sending quantum states and receiving classical answers  the outcomes of some local measurements ( see fig  [ protocol ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> he then evaluates a _ reward _ function from coincidence statistics and pays the players accordingly . confined to not communicate during the game , known as the local operations and shared randomness ( losr ) paradigm , all separable states deliver an equal _ pay - off _ ( maximum average reward ) in any specific sqnlg . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , for every entangled quantum state one can always find a sqnlg which can deliver a larger pay - off than any separable state . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping allows one to merely rely on the coincidence statistics of measurement outcomes , rather than their specific expectation values , to violate an entanglement witnessing inequality  @xcite ; a property that was believed to be specific to bell nonlocality scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , researchers interpreted buscemi s results as a clever way to remove the trust from measurement devices in an entanglement witnessing procedure , since any entanglement witness ( ew ) can be recast as a sqnlg  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the second challenge , a first level of hardness is that the quantification of entanglement using almost any entanglement measure , e.g. , entanglement of formation  @xcite , negativity  @xcite , or random robustness  @xcite , requires estimating a large number of density matrix elements ; a task which is difficult to perform on bipartite and multipartite quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> while this difficulty can be partially circumvented by making use of ews when lower bounds on the entanglement are desired  @xcite , errors and misalignments of the measurement devices can still lead to the incorrect estimations of the quantities and thus , erroneous conclusions .    in this letter , inspired by buscemi s approach , we consider sqnlgs in the paradigm of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a small subset of games which we call extremal semiquantum witnessing games ( esqwgs ) are both necessary and sufficient for the full characterization of entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> we then focus on the entanglement of negative - partial - transpose ( npt ) states , as the necessary ingredient for distillability  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we present the answer to the practical appeal for a measurement - device - independent ( mdi ) npt - entanglement measure by proving that npt entanglement can be quantified by a referee in _ a single arbitrary _ esqwg . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of the present letter is thus to introduce an operationally accessible measure ( for both general and npt ) entanglement that is convex , universal , and most importantly mdi by construction . </S>",
