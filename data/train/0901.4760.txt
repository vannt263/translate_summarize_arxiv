    "within the very large and beautiful world of probability theory , percolation theory has been an especially attractive subject , an area in which the major problems are easily stated but whose solutions , when they exist , often require ingenious methods .",
    "dynamical percolation is a model where we add a simple time dynamics to the percolation model .",
    "it happened to have turned out that this new model is very rich and much can be said about it .",
    "it is hoped that this survey will provide a good guide to the literature from which point the reader can study the various papers on the subject of dynamical percolation .      in the standard percolation model , we take an infinite connected locally finite graph @xmath0 , fix @xmath1 $ ] and let each edge ( bond ) of @xmath0 be , independently of all others , open with probability @xmath2 and closed with probability @xmath3 .",
    "write @xmath4 for this product measure .",
    "in percolation theory , one studies the structure of the connected components ( clusters ) of the random subgraph of @xmath0 consisting of all sites and all open edges .",
    "the first question that can be asked is the existence of an infinite connected component ( in which case we say percolation occurs ) .",
    "writing @xmath5 for this latter event , kolmogorov s 0 - 1 law tells us that the probability of @xmath5 is , for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 , either 0 or 1 .",
    "since @xmath6 is nondecreasing in @xmath2 , there exists a critical probability @xmath7 $ ] such that @xmath8 at @xmath9 , we can have either @xmath10 or @xmath11 , depending on @xmath0 .",
    "site percolation is defined analogously where the vertices are retained independently with probability @xmath2 and all the edges between retained vertices are retained .    for the @xmath12-dimensional cubic lattice , which is the graph classically studied ,",

    "while a tremendous amount is known about this model , we highlight some key facts . in the following",

    "@xmath14 for @xmath15 , harris @xcite established in 1960 that there is no percolation at @xmath16 and kesten @xcite established in 1980 that there is percolation for @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we see there is no percolation at the critical value for @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath14 for @xmath13 with @xmath18 , hara and slade @xcite established that there is no percolation at the critical value .",

    "@xmath14 aizenman , kesten and newman @xcite proved that on @xmath13 , when there is percolation , there is then a unique infinite cluster .",
    "later burton and keane @xcite established this in much greater generality but more importantly found a much simpler proof of this theorem .",
    "we end this subsection with an important open question .",
    "@xmath14 for @xmath13 , for intermediate dimensions , such as @xmath20 , is there percolation at the critical value ?",
    "hggstrm , peres and steif  @xcite initiated the study of dynamical percolation .",
    "in fact , olle hggstrm and i came up with the model inspired by a question that paul malliavin asked at a lecture i gave at the mittag leffler institute in 1995 .",
    "this model was invented independently by itai benjamini . in this model , with @xmath2 fixed , the edges of @xmath0 switch back and forth according to independent 2-state continuous time markov chains where closed switches to open at rate @xmath2 and open switches to closed at rate @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , @xmath4 is the unique stationary distribution for this markov process .",
    "the general question studied in dynamical percolation is whether , when we start with distribution @xmath4 , there exist atypical times at which the percolation structure looks markedly different than that at a fixed time . in almost all cases , the term `` markedly different '' refers to the existence or nonexistence of an infinite connected component .",
    "dynamical percolation on site percolation models is defined analogously .",
    "it turns out that dynamical percolation is a very interesting model which exhibits quite new phenomena .",
    "it also connects up very much with the recent and important developments in 2-d critical percolation .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", hggstrm gives a description of the early results in dynamical percolation and some open questions ; most of these earlier results will be repeated here .",
    "we also mention the following upcoming paper @xcite by garban which will discuss oded schramm s contributions to the area of noise sensitivity ; this paper will have some overlap with the present paper .",
    "in section [ sect : firstresults ] , we will start with a discussion of some of the first results obtained for dynamical percolation including ( 1 ) `` triviality away from criticality '' , ( 2 ) the existence of graphs with `` exceptional times '' and ( 3 ) nonexistence of `` exceptional times '' for high dimensional lattices . in section [",
    "sect : tree ] , we present the fairly refined results that have been obtained for trees that do not percolate at criticality in ordinary percolation .",
    "we present in section [ sect : ns ] the basic elements of noise sensitivity and influence together with the fourier spectrum which is the key tool for the analysis of these concepts .",
    "these concepts are both interesting in themselves and are key in the `` second moment method '' approach to proving the existence of exceptional times for dynamical percolation in 2 dimensions as well as to computing the hausdorff dimension of the set of exceptional times .",
    "section [ sect : crit ] briefly reviews results concerning critical exponents for ordinary critical percolation since these are crucial to the study of dynamical percolation in 2 dimensions .",
    "in section [ sect : ss ] , we outline the proofs from @xcite for the hexagonal lattice of the existence of exceptional times for dynamical percolation ( which also yields a nonsharp lower bound on the hausdorff dimension ) and obtain a lower bound for the noise sensitivity exponent for crossing probabilities .",
    "( for the square lattice , positivity of the noise sensitivity exponent was established but not the existence of exceptional times . )",
    "this method managed to estimate the fourier spectrum well enough to obtain the above two results .",
    "however , the estimates of the spectrum that this method led to were not sharp enough to yield the exact noise sensitivity exponent or the exact dimension of the set of exceptional times .",
    "we present the results from @xcite in section [ sect : gps ] .",
    "these yield for the hexagonal lattice the exact dimension of the set of exceptional times for dynamical percolation and the exact noise sensitivity exponent for crossing probabilities .",
    "( for the square lattice , existence of exceptional times for dynamical percolation as well as sharp noise results in terms of the number of pivotals is also established . )",
    "these arguments are based on a completely different method to analyze the fourier spectrum which turns out to be sharp .",
    "essentially all the results above dealt with graphs which do not percolate at criticality .",
    "when dealing with graphs which do percolate at criticality and asking if there are exceptional times of _ non_-percolation , the structure of the problem is very different .",
    "a number of results in this case are presented in section [ sect : pss ] .    in section [",
    "sect : iic ] , a relationship between the incipient infinite cluster ( in ordinary percolation ) and the structure of the infinite cluster at exceptional times in dynamical percolation is presented .",
    "recent work on the scaling limit of dynamical percolation on the hexagonal lattice is discussed in section [ sect : sl ] , . finally , in section [ sect : bs ] , dynamical percolation for certain interacting particle systems",
    "are discussed .",
    "we end the introduction by mentioning that there are a number of other papers , such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , dealing with the existence of certain `` exceptional times '' for various models . on an abstract level ,",
    "the questions we are asking concerning exceptional behavior are equivalent to questions concerning the polarity or nonpolarity of certain sets for our ( markovian ) dynamical percolation model ; see @xcite . sometimes , the exceptional objects one looks for are of a more general nature such as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this section will discuss a selected subset of the results that were obtained in @xcite and @xcite , which were the first two papers on dynamical percolation .",
    "the first very elementary result is the following and contained in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21 be the event that there is an infinite cluster at time @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the probability measure governing the whole process when parameter @xmath2 is used and the graph is understood .",

    "p_c(g ) \\ , . \\end{array }   \\nonumber\\ ] ]    outline of proof : for the first part , we choose @xmath25 sufficiently small so that the set of edges which are open at _ some time _ during a time interval of length @xmath25 is still subcritical",
    ". then on each `` @xmath25-interval '' there are no exceptional times of percolation and we use countable additivity . the second part is proved in the same way .",
    "@xmath26    this result suggests that the only interesting parameter is the critical one and this is essentially true .",
    "however , before restricting ourselves in the continuation to the critical case , we do mention two results for the supercritical case , both from @xcite .",
    "the first result is a version for dynamical percolation of the uniqueness of the infinite cluster .",
    "[ th : lattice]@xcite consider dynamical percolation with parameter @xmath27 on the @xmath12-dimensional cubic lattice @xmath13",
    ". then a.s .",
    ", for all times @xmath22 , there exists a unique infinite cluster .",
    "[ pr : treesupercr]@xcite let @xmath28 be any infinite tree . if @xmath29 , then a.s .",
    ", there exist infinitely many infinite clusters for all @xmath22 .",
    "we now stick to the critical case .",
    "the following result says that dynamical percolation can exhibit _ exceptional times _ which then insures that this model is interesting .",
    "[ th : g1g2]@xcite there exists a @xmath30 which does not percolate at criticality but such that there exist exceptional times of percolation .",
    "+ there also exists a graph @xmath31 which percolates at criticality but such that there exist exceptional times of nonpercolation .",
    "these graphs were obtained by replacing the edges of @xmath15 by larger and larger finite graphs which simulated having the original edge move back and forth quickly .",
    "these graphs have unbounded degree .",
    "many examples with bounded degree were later discovered and will be discussed in later sections .",
    "once we have the existence of such examples , it is natural to ask what happens on the standard graphs that we are familiar with .",
    "the following result answers this for the cubic lattice in high dimensions .",
    "( recall hara and slade @xcite proved that ordinary percolation does not percolate at criticality in this case . )    @xcite [ th : zd ] for the integer lattice @xmath13 with @xmath32 dynamical critical percolation has no exceptional times of percolation .",
    "the key reason for this is a highly nontrivial result due to hara and slade , that says that if @xmath33 is the probability that the origin percolates when the parameter is @xmath2 , then @xmath34    in fact , theorem [ th : zd ] was shown to hold under the assumption ( [ eq : derive ] ) .",
    "outline of proof : we use a first moment argument together with the proof method of proposition [ pr : noncrit ] .",
    "we break the time interval @xmath35 $ ] into @xmath36 intervals each of length @xmath37 .",
    "if we fix one of these intervals , the set of edges which are open at _ some time _ during this interval has density about @xmath38 .",
    "hence the probability that the origin percolates with respect to these set of edges is by ( [ eq : derive ] ) at most @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that the expected number of these intervals where this occurs is at most @xmath40 .",
    "it can then be argued using fatou s lemma that a.s .",
    "there are at most finitely many exceptional times during @xmath35 $ ] at which the origin percolates .",
    "to go from there to no exceptional times can either be done by using some rather abstract markov process theory or , as was done in the paper , by hand , which was not completely trivial .",
    "@xmath26    it is known , due to kesten and zhang @xcite , that ( [ eq : derive ] ) fails for @xmath15 .",
    "the question of whether there are exceptional times for critical dynamical percolation on @xmath15 was left open in @xcite .",
    "( recall there is no percolation at a fixed time in this case . )",
    "this question will be resolved in sections [ sect : ss ] and [ sect : gps ] .",
    "although theorem [ th : g1g2 ] demonstrated the existence of graphs which have exceptional times where the percolation picture is different from that at a fixed time , in @xcite , a more detailed analysis was done for trees .    to explain this , we first need to give a little background from ordinary percolation on trees , results which are due to lyons and contained in @xcite and @xcite",
    "lyons obtained an explicit condition when a given tree percolates at a given value of @xmath2 .",
    "this formula becomes simplest when the ( rooted ) tree is so - called _ spherically symmetric _ which means that all vertices at a given level have the same number of children , although this number may depend on the given level .",

    "+ ( ii ) @xmath43 if and only if @xmath44 where + @xmath45 = p^n t_n$ ] .",
    "note that ( i ) essentially follows from ( ii ) . in @xcite",
    ", an explicit condition was obtained for when , given a general tree and a value of @xmath2 , there exists for dynamical percolation a time at which percolation occurs .",
    "again the spherically symmetric case is simplest .",
    "@xcite [ th : hpstree ] ( case of spherically symmetric trees ) + let @xmath46 be as in the previous result . then there exists a.s .  a time at which percolation occurs ( equivalently with positive probability there exists a time in @xmath35 $ ] at which the root percolates ) if and only if @xmath47 .",
    "example : if @xmath48 , then the critical value is @xmath16 , there is no percolation at criticality but there are exceptional times at which percolation occurs ( which will have dimension @xmath16 by our next result ) .",
    "( the symbol @xmath49 means that the ratio of the two sides is bounded away from zero and infinity by constants . )    outline of proof : for the `` if '' direction , we apply the second moment method to the random variables @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the lebesgue amount of time during @xmath35 $ ] that the root is connected to @xmath52 and @xmath41 now denotes the set of vertices at the @xmath36th level .",

    "this implies that it is very unlikely that such a pair exists .",
    "@xmath26    in @xcite , it was shown that some of the more refined results in @xcite and theorem [ th : hpstree ] above together yield that a spherically symmetric tree has an exceptional time of percolation if and only if @xmath58 .",

    "it was also shown in @xcite that for general trees , the `` only if '' holds but not the `` if '' .    in the spherically symmetric case , the hausdorff dimension was also determined in @xcite .",
    "@xcite [ th : hpstreehd ] consider a spherically symmetric tree and let @xmath46 be as in the two previous results .",
    "then the hausdorff dimension of the set of times at which percolation occurs is given by @xmath60 \\",

    "\\ , .\\ ] ]    while we do not state the results here , we mention that @xcite went a good deal further for spherically symmetric trees . what was obtained in @xcite",
    "was ( see corollary 5.1 there ) a `` capacity condition '' for which subsets of time have the property that with positive probability they contain a percolating time .",
    "this is analogous to the well - known kakutani criterion ( in terms of newtonian capacity ) of which subsets in euclidean space intersect a brownian motion path with positive probability .",
    "once we have such a capacity condition , peres intersection equivalence theory ( @xcite and @xcite ) leads to a criterion for when there are exceptional times at which there are at least @xmath61 infinite clusters .",
    "we can in particular construct trees for which there are times at which we have ( say ) 6 infinite clusters but no times at which there are 7 infinite clusters .",
    "in addition , various hausdorff dimensions of these different exceptional time sets can be computed .    on a much less formal note ,",
    "my personal feeling is that the set of exceptional times in these cases , very vaguely speaking , might have a similar structure to the set of so - called `` slow '' points for brownian motion . in section  [",
    "sect : pss ] , we will see a very different type of set of exceptional times for dynamical percolation and i believe that in this latter case , this set might behave more like the set of so - called `` fast '' points for brownian motion . here",
    "are two words explaining this vague connection ( for those who know these concepts from brownian motion ) . for a time point @xmath62 to be a slow point , it must be the case that @xmath63 does not go above a certain ( well - specified ) level for _ all _ values of small @xmath22 while a time @xmath62 is an exceptional time of percolation if the origin percolates out to _ all _ distances .",
    "on the other hand , for a time point @xmath62 to be a fast point , it must be the case that @xmath63 goes above a certain ( well - specified ) level for an _ infinite number _ of arbitrarily small @xmath22 while a time @xmath62 is an exceptional time of non - percolation say for a tree if we have an _ infinite number _ of cut - sets which are off .",
    "this type of structure looks like something which is called a limsup fractal ; see @xcite .",
    "we end by mentioning that in @xcite , khoshnevisan extended to general trees the result of peres and steif determining which time sets contain percolating times .",
    "results concerning the hausdorff dimension of exceptional times for general trees are also obtained in @xcite .",
    "some of the techniques use methods from @xcite .",
    "the study of noise sensitivity and noise stability for boolean functions was initiated in @xcite .",
    "the concepts discussed in this section come from or are motivated by this source .",
    "see @xcite for a nice survey of noise sensitivity and its applications in theoretic computer science .",
    "see also @xcite for related matters .      as indicated in the introduction ,",
    "the notion of noise sensitivity is _ both _ an interesting concept in itself _ and _ what is needed to carry out the second moment arguments necessary for the results described in sections [ sect : ss ] and [ sect : gps ] .",
    "let @xmath64 be uniformly chosen from the @xmath36-dimensional discrete cube @xmath65 ( which we can think of as @xmath36 fair coin flips ) and let @xmath66 be @xmath64 but with each bit independently `` rerandomized '' with probability @xmath67 .",

    "there are a number of other results in this paper which we do not detail here .",
    "before discussing the scaling limit of dynamical percolation , it is necessary to first discuss the scaling limit of ordinary percolation . there is a lot to be said here and this section will be somewhat less precise than the earlier sections . since even the formulations can be quite technical ,",
    "i will be , unlike in the previous sections , `` cheating '' in various places .",
    "even before we state the scaling limit of percolation , we need to first briefly explain the concept of conformal invariance and cardy s formula .",

    "the first half of the following conjecture was stated in @xcite and attributed to michael aizenman .",
    "the second half of the conjecture is due to cardy @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) for all @xmath346 and @xmath347 and @xmath348 as above , @xmath350 exists and is conformally invariant in the sense that if @xmath76 is a conformal mapping , then @xmath351 .",

    "cardy s formula is quite complicated involving hypergeometric functions but lennart carleson realized that assuming conformal invariance , there is a nicer set of `` representing '' domains with four specified points for which the limit has a much simpler form .",
    "namely , if @xmath346 is an equilateral triangle ( with side lengths 1 ) , @xmath353 and @xmath92 the three corner points and @xmath348 ( on the line between @xmath92 and @xmath77 ) having distance @xmath354 from @xmath92 , then the above probability would just be @xmath354 .",
    "using carleson s reformulation of cardy s formula , smirnov proved the above conjecture for the hexagonal lattice .",
    "[ th : smirnov]@xcite for the hexagonal lattice , both ( i ) and ( ii ) of the above conjecture are true .",
    "this conjecture is also believed to hold on @xmath15 but is not ( yet ) proved in that case . in @xcite ,",
    "schramm described what the interfaces between whites and blacks should be as the lattice spacing goes to 0 , assuming conformal invariance . in the appropriate formulation , it should be an sle@xmath355 curve .",
    "smirnov @xcite proved this convergence for one interface and camia and newman @xcite proved a `` full scaling limit '' , which is a description of the behavior of all the interfaces together .",
    "the critical exponents described in section [ sect : crit ] are proved by exploiting the sle description of the interfaces .",
    "all of the above is described well in @xcite .",
    "it turns out , in order to obtain a scaling limit of dynamical percolation , a different description , due to schramm and smirnov , of the scaling limit of ordinary percolation is preferable .",
    "a quad @xmath356 is a subset of the plane homeomorphic to a disk together with its boundary partitioned into 4 continuous pieces .",
    "a configuration for the scaling limit is described by a family of @xmath261-@xmath357 random variables @xmath358 indexed by the quads @xmath356 where @xmath359 means there is a crossing from the first to the third boundary piece of @xmath356 using white hexagons .",
    "equivalently , an element of the state space is a collection of quads ( satisfying a certain necessary monotonicity condition and suitably measurable ) where the collection of quads represents the quads which are `` crossed '' .",
    "an important advantage of this state space , which we denote by @xmath172 , is that it is a compact metrizable space .",
    "this avoids the need for tightness arguments . if we perform percolation on the @xmath37 scaled hexagonal lattice , the @xmath358 s are well - defined random variables and so we obtain a probability measure @xmath360 on @xmath172 .",
    "it turns out that the sequence of probability measures @xmath360 have a limit @xmath343 , which we call the scaling limit .",
    "note that for each @xmath36 , there is essentially a 1 - 1 correspondence between percolation realizations on the @xmath37 scaled lattice and elements in @xmath172 . in the limit",
    "however , we can not talk anymore about percolation configurations but rather the only information left is which quads are `` crossed '' .",
    "( the latter is sort of the `` macroscopic '' information . )",
    "we now move to a scaling limit for dynamical percolation .",
    "consider dynamical percolation on the @xmath37 scaled hexagonal lattice .",
    "we can think of our dynamical percolation on this scaled lattice as a process @xmath361 taking values in @xmath172 .",
    "we can try to let @xmath36 go to infinity , in which case , the marginal for each @xmath22 will certainly go to @xmath343 .",
    "however due to the noise sensitivity of percolation , for any fixed @xmath362 and any quad @xmath356 , the crossing of @xmath356 at time @xmath62 and at time @xmath22 will become asymptotically independent as @xmath138 which implies that the processes @xmath361 converge to something which is `` independent copies of @xmath343 for all different times '' .",
    "this is clearly not what we want . in order to obtain a nontrivial limit",
    ", we should slow down time by a factor of @xmath363 where @xmath364 is explained in section [ sect : gps ] .",
    "[ th : scalinglimit]@xcite let @xmath365",
    ". then @xmath366 converges in law to a process @xmath367 under the topology of local uniform convergence .",
    "moreover , the limiting process is markovian ( which is not apriori obvious at all ) .",
    "we explain now why the time scaling is as above .",
    "consider the quad corresponding to the unit square together with its four sides .",
    "the expected number of pivotals for a left to right crossing of this quad on the @xmath37 scaled lattice is @xmath368 .",
    "next , the above time scaling updates each hexagon in unit time with probability about @xmath369 and therefore , by the above , updates on average order 1 pivotals .",
    "it follows from the main result in @xcite that if we scale `` faster '' than this , you get a limit which is independent at different times and if we scale `` slower '' than this , you get a limit which is constant in time .",
    "this scaling is such that the correlation between this event occuring at time 0 and occuring at time 1 stays strictly between 0 and 1 , which is something we of course want .    in the above paper",
    ", there is another model which is studied called near - critical percolation for which a scaling limit is proved in a similar fashion .",
    "near - critical percolation can be thought of as a version of dynamical percolation , where sites are flipping only in one direction and hence after time @xmath22 , the density of open sites is about @xmath370 .    to prove theorem [ th : scalinglimit ] , there are two key steps .",
    "the first key step is a stability type result . in very vague terms",
    ", it says that if we look at the configuration at time 0 , ignore the evolution of the hexagons which are initially pivotal only for crossings which occur at macroscopic scale at most @xmath140 ( which should be thought of as much larger than the lattice spacing ) but observe the evolution of the hexagons which are initially pivotal for crossings which occur at macroscopic scale larger than @xmath140 , then we can still predict quite well ( i.e. , with high probability if @xmath140 is small ) how the crossings evolve on macroscopic scale 1 .    since we can not see the individual hexagons which are initially pivotal for crossings at scale at least @xmath140 in the scaling limit , in order for this stability result to be useful , we need at least that the number of such hexagons in a given region can be read off from the scaling limit , so that we know the rate with which macroscopic crossings are changing .",
    "this is obtained by the second key step . for every @xmath36 ,",
    "look at ordinary percolation on the @xmath37 scaled lattice and consider the set of hexagons from which emanate 4 paths of alterating colors to macroscopic - distance @xmath140 away .",
    "( these are the hexagons which , if flipped , change the state of a crossing at scale @xmath140 . )",
    "let @xmath371 be counting measure on such points divided by @xmath372 .",
    "this scaling is such that the expected measure of the unit square is of order 1 ( as @xmath373 if @xmath140 is fixed ) .",
    "[ th : measure]@xcite for all @xmath140 , @xmath374 converges , as @xmath373 , to a limit @xmath375 _ and _ @xmath376 is a measurable function of @xmath377 .",
    "the argument of this result is very difficult .",
    "i say however a word on how this gives a nice construction of the scaling limit of dynamical percolation .",
    "the idea is that one constructs a dynamical percolation realization by first taking a realization from the @xmath378 scaling limit ( or equivalently @xmath377 above ) , looks at @xmath376 ( which requires no further randomness because @xmath376 has been proved to be a function of @xmath377 ) and then builds an appropriate poisson point process over the random measure @xmath379 which will be used to dictate when the different crossings of quads of scale at least @xmath140 will change their state .",
    "this is done for all @xmath140 and the stability result is needed to ensure that the process described in this way is in fact the scaling limit of dynamical percolation .",
    "the idea that dynamical percolation ( and near - critical percolation ) could possibly be built up in this manner from a poisson process over a random measure was suggested by camia , fontes and newman in the paper @xcite .",
    "it is also shown in @xcite that a type of `` conformal covariance '' for the above measures @xmath376 holds but this will not be detailed here .",
    "the argument for theorem [ th : measure ] also proves the existence of natural time - parametrizations for the sle@xmath355 and sle@xmath380 curves , a question studied in @xcite for general sle@xmath381 .",
    "in @xcite , certain interacting particle systems were studied and the question of whether there are exceptional times at which the percolation structure looks different from that at a fixed time was investigated .",
    "the two systems studied were the contact process and the glauber dynamics for the ising model .",
    "most of the results dealt with noncritical cases but since the dynamics are not independent , a good deal more work was needed compared to the easy proof of proposition [ pr : noncrit ] .",
    "however , there was one very interesting case left open in this work which was the following .",
    "consider the glauber dynamics for the critical @xmath382-dimensional ising model .",
    "first note that @xmath382 dimensions is special for the ising model compared to higher dimensions since it is known that for @xmath15 the critical value for phase transition is the same as the critical value for when percolation occurs .",
    "the ising model does not percolate in @xmath382 dimensions at the critical value and in view of theorem [ th : ss ] , it is natural to ask if there are exceptional times of percolation for the glauber dynamics . during a visit to microsoft , gbor pete suggested to me that this might not be the case since the scaling limit of the ising model was conjectured to be sle@xmath383 , which unlike sle@xmath355 ( the scaling limit of percolation ) , does not hit itself .",
    "this yields that there should not be so many pivotal sites which suggests no exceptional times .",
    "a few months later in park city , christophe garban sketched out a `` 1st moment argument '' for me which would give no exceptional times under certain assumptions .    in any case ,",
    "whether or not one can actually prove this , it now seems clear that there are no exceptional times for the glauber dynamics .",
    "this seems to be a beautiful example of how the qualitative difference in the behavior of the two respective sle scaling limits ( self - intersections versus not ) yields a fundamental difference between the natural dynamics on ordinary percolation and the natural dynamics on the ising model concerning whether there are exceptional times of percolation or not .",
