    "the properties of a uniform dilute interacting @xmath1 bose or fermi @xmath1 atomic quantum gas interacting by an @xmath2-wave contact inteaction at zero temperature is determined by two scales @xmath1 the atomic scattering length @xmath3 and density @xmath4 . as @xmath5 at unitarity ,",
    "the first scale is not of concern and the observables of the gas are solely determined by density and the gas exhibits a universal behavior .",
    "bulk chemical potential @xmath6 of the unitary gas is proportional to the _ only _ available energy scale @xmath1 the fermi energy ( or the chemical potential of the noninteracting gas ) @xmath7 @xmath1 so that @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is a universal parameter and @xmath9 is the mass of an atom @xcite .",
    "similarly , the energy per particle @xmath10 of the unitary gas is proportional to the energy per particle @xmath11 of the noninteracting gas : @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy is a physically meaningful quantity for the fermi gas , but the same can also be used as an energy scale for the bose gas @xcite .",
    "the bose and fermi gases behave similarly at unitarity , because the bose gas exhibits fermionization .",
    "if this fermionization of the bose gas is absolute , then @xmath0 should be the same for the bose and fermi gases .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 relating the energy of the noninteracting and unitary gases , has been  measured \" experimentally from a study at or near unitarity of the density @xcite , or of ground - state energy , or of sound velocity @xcite of a trapped fermi gas . but",
    "a similar experiment is more difficult for a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) due to a large probability of three - body loss by molecule formation at or near unitarity , which is the threshold for molecule formation @xcite . in the weak - coupling limit ( @xmath13 )",
    "the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation gives a good description of a trapped bec , where @xmath14 is the density . in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath15 )",
    "the gp equation highly overestimates the atomic contact interaction and leads to unphysical results .",
    "experimental activities to access the strong - coupling regime of a bec , to test the beyond mean - field corrections @xcite , and to extract the parameter @xmath0 from these studies have just began @xcite .",
    "although unitarity is also the threshold for molecule formation in a two - component ( spin up and down ) fermi gas , the probability of formation of diatomic molecules is highly suppressed in this case due to pauli repulsion among spin - parallel fermions in the three - fermion system and hence is not of concern @xcite .    lately , becs of @xmath16cr @xcite and @xmath17dy @xcite with large dipolar interaction have been observed and studied .",
    "the inter - atomic interaction now has two components : an @xmath2-wave contact interaction and an anisotropic long - range dipolar interaction .",
    "this allows to study the dipolar bec with a variable contact interaction @xcite using a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the intrinsically anisotropic dipolar bec @xcite has many distinct features @xcite .",
    "the stability of a dipolar bec depends not only on the scattering length , but also on the trap geometry @xcite .",
    "a disk - shaped trap leads to a repulsive dipolar interaction and the dipolar bec is more stable , whereas a cigar - shaped trap yields an attractive dipolar interaction and hence favors a collapse instability @xcite .",
    "we study the static and dynamic properties of a disk - shaped dipolar bec and dipolar bec vortex , with the dipole moments aligned perpendicular to the plane of the disk , for large scattering length using a beyond - mean - field model @xcite for the bec - unitarity crossover . in this paper",
    "we consider the strong - coupling limit of the contact interaction only and _ not _ the same limit of dipolar interaction . in the weak - coupling limit , this crossover model reduces to the gp equation and the lee - huang - yang ( lhy ) correction @xcite , whereas in the strong - coupling regime of large scattering length it reduces to the universal result at unitarity .",
    "we find that the radial densities are sensitive to the parameter @xmath0 in the strong - coupling regime and hence a study of density is expected to yield information about this parameter .",
    "however , the frequency of oscillation of the dipolar bec is found to be insensitive to this parameter .",
    "from a study of vortices in a disk - shaped dipolar bec we find that both density and radius of vortex core are sensitive to this parameter in the strong - coupling regime .    in the disk configuration ,",
    "the dipolar interaction is highly repulsive , as parallel dipoles arranged in a plane with the dipole moment perpendicular to the plane repeal each other @xcite .",
    "the strongly repulsive dipolar interaction should reduce three - body loss by molecule formation in the strong - coupling regime , as the rate of the reaction @xmath18 should be suppressed in this setting with @xmath19 representing a dipolar atom and @xmath20 a molecule .",
    "also , as both the contact and long - range dipolar interactions contribute to molecule formation , the threshold for molecule formation will be displaced from unitarity , specially in strongly dipolar becs , thus creating a new scenario of experiment with a dipolar bec in the strong - coupling regime to determine the parameter @xmath0 .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the mean - field and beyond - mean - field models to study a dipolar bec in the weak- and strong - coupling regimes as well as along the bec - unitarity crossover as the scattering length @xmath3 is increased .",
    "we also present a gaussian variational formulation for its solution at unitarity . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of numerical and variational studies of density , root - mean square ( rms ) sizes , chemical potential , and frequencies of radial and axial oscillations of a disk - shaped dipolar bec and bec vortex . finally in sec .",
    "iv we present a brief summary and conclusion .",

( [ gp3d ] )",
    "is independent of @xmath3 and is @xcite @xmath46    to obtain a quantized vortex of unit angular momentum @xmath47 ; around @xmath33 axis , we introduce a phase ( equal to the azimuthal angle ) in the wave function @xcite .",
    "this procedure introduces a centrifugal term @xmath48 $ ] in the potential of the gp equation so that @xmath49 we adopt this procedure to study an axially - symmetric vortex in a disk - shaped dipolar bec .",

    "in addition to studying the system in the weak - coupling limit ( [ gpbulk ] ) and unitarity ( [ unibulk ] ) , we also consider the system along the full bec - unitarity crossover from weak to strong coupling , as the parameter @xmath51 is increased .",

    "we use @xmath57 .",
    "this value of @xmath54 was used @xcite successfully in a study of @xmath58li@xmath59 bec in the bec - unitarity crossover .",
    "expression ( [ bulk ] ) can also reproduce fairly well @xcite the energies of diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculation @xcite of a trapped bosonic system of small number of atoms .",
    "it was found that the energies obtained from the crossover model ( [ bulk ] ) for that bosonic system are in better agreement with the dmc calculation than those obtained from the gp equation .",
    "the crossover model ( [ bulk ] ) is galilei invariant and yields the hydrodynamic equations of the dipolar bec at zero temperature , and enables one to study collective dynamical properties of the system in the full crossover from weak - coupling to unitarity @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ gp3d ] ) and ( [ bulk ] ) should be considered as a generalization of the gp equation with beyond mean - field corrections to properly include the effect of interaction for large positive scattering length .",
    "the saturation of the interaction at unitarity is properly taken care of in the crossover model ( [ bulk ] ) .",
    "as an application we shall study here the properties of a disk - shaped dipolar bec and dipolar bec vortex in the strong - coupling regime to show the sensitivity of the result to the universal parameter @xmath0 .      at unitarity , the dipolar mean - field equations ( [ gp3d ] ) , ( [ pot ] ) , and ( [ unibulk ] ) can be conveniently solved by a time - dependent lagrangian variational approach .",
    "this can be used to study the size and frequencies of oscillation of the dipolar bec at unitarity .",
    "this is done by reducing eq .",
    "( [ gp3d ] ) to a system of second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations involving the variational parameters . the lagrangian density of eq .",

    "we perform numerical simulation of the 3d gp equation ( [ gp3d ] ) using the split - step crank - nicolson method @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the dipolar integral term in this equation in coordinate space is not straightforward due to the divergence at short distances .",
    "however , this has been tackled by evaluating the dipolar term in the momentum ( k ) space .",
    "the integral can be simplified in fourier space by means of convolution as @xcite @xmath76({\\bf k } ) { \\cal f}[|\\phi|^2]({\\bf k } ) \\}({\\bf r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath77 @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 are the fourier transform ( ft ) and inverse ft , respectively .",
