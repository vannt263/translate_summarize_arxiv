    "at the end of the 19th century , josef melan @xcite suggested the following fourth order ordinary differential equation to describe the behavior of suspension bridges : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the distance between the two towers , @xmath2 denotes the vertical displacement of the beam representing the deck , @xmath3 is the position of the sustaining cable at rest , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the elastic modulus of the material composing the deck and the moment of inertia of the cross section so that @xmath6 is the flexural rigidity , @xmath7 is the horizontal tension of the cable when subject to the dead load @xmath8 , @xmath9 represents the additional tension in the cable produced by the live load @xmath10 .",
    "the dead load @xmath11 includes the weights of the cable , of the hangers , and of the deck . in the book by von krmn - biot ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 5.5 ) ) , is called the _ fundamental equation of the theory of the suspension bridge_. in figure [ bridge ] we sketch a picture of a suspension bridge .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the additional tension @xmath9 in deserves a particular attention since it is nonlocal and it introduces a nonlinearity into the equation . as we shall see , the computation of @xmath9 is delicate and , in literature , there are several different ways to approximate it , see @xcite . for both the original term @xmath9 and these approximate forms of it , one can show that there exists at least one solution of the melan equation with hinged boundary conditions , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) .",
    "the melan equation is also quite challenging for numerical analysts , see @xcite where several approximating procedures for the solution of have been discussed for different forms of the term @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive the melan equation from a variational principle and to study its behavior .",
    "we prove that the euler - lagrange equation , see , admits at least one solution and we prove uniqueness for certain values of the parameters .",
    "we also discuss uniqueness for the remaining values of the parameters and we give some numerical results which show how delicate and unstable the equation is .",
    "finally , we emphasize the role of the nonlinearity and a qualitative difference between the solution of the variational problem with the solution of a simplified problem .",
    "following von krmn - biot ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section vii.5 ) , we view the main span of a suspension bridge as a combined system of a perfectly flexible string ( the sustaining cable ) and a beam ( the deck ) .",
    "the beam and the string are connected by a large number of inextensible hangers , see figure [ bridge ] .    , width=377,height=113 ]    the point @xmath12 is the origin of the orthogonal coordinate system and positive displacements are oriented downwards .",
    "the point @xmath13 has coordinates @xmath14 with @xmath1 being the length of the deck between the two towers .",
    "if no live loads act on the beam , there is no bending moment in the beam and the cable is in the position @xmath15 , while the unloaded beam is in the horizontal position of the segment connecting @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in this situation , the horizontal component @xmath16 of the tension of the cable is constant .",
    "hence , there is an equilibrium position in the system and the configuration of the cable is obtained by solving the equation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1.3 ) , section vii ) ) @xmath17 since the endpoints of the cable are at the same level @xmath18 ( the height of the towers ) and since the dead load @xmath11 is constant , the solution of is @xmath19 hence , the cable has the shape of a parabola and @xmath20 therefore , the length of the cable at rest is @xmath21    when a live load @xmath22 acts on the deck of the bridge , the beam may leave the horizontal position and produce a displacement @xmath23 ( positive displacements are oriented downwards ) . by assuming that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are small , let us compute the energies involved when the system is in this new position .",
    "the potential energy produced by the live and dead loads reads @xmath26    the elastic energy @xmath27 necessary to bend the beam is the squared curvature times half the flexural rigidity , that is , @xmath28 where we used the fact that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are both small and we neglect the terms @xmath29 of superquadratic order .",
    "since the cable is assumed to be perfectly flexible , it has no resistance to bending .",
    "then the only internal force is its tension which consists of two parts : the tension at rest @xmath30 and the additional tension @xmath9 due to the variation of length of the cable .",
    "the former is @xmath31 and the amount of energy needed to deform the cable at rest under the tension @xmath30 in the infinitesimal interval @xmath32 $ ] from the original position @xmath15 to the new position @xmath33 is the variation of length times the tension , that is , @xmath34 then , the energy necessary to deform the whole cable at rest under the tension @xmath30 is @xmath35\\left(\\sqrt{1+\\frac{2w'y'}{1+(y')^2}+\\frac{(w')^2}{1+(y')^2}}-1\\right)}dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to maintain only the at most quadratic terms , we use the asymptotic expansion @xmath36 as @xmath37 ; with an integration by parts we then get @xmath38\\left(\\frac{w'y'}{1+(y')^2}+\\frac{(w')^2}{2(1+(y')^2)^2}\\right)}dx=\\frac{h}{2 } \\int_0^l{\\frac{(w')^2}{1+(y')^2}}dx+h\\int_0^l{w'y'}dx\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{h}{2 } \\int_0^l{\\frac{(w')^2}{1+(y')^2}}dx+q\\int_0^l{w}dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the additional tension @xmath9 , we note that the hangers connecting the cable and the beam are inextensible . therefore , the deflection of the cable follows the displacement @xmath23 of the deck , that is , the cable reaches the new position @xmath39 and the variation of the cable length due to the deformation @xmath23 is given by ( see - ) @xmath40 if @xmath41 denotes the cross - sectional area of the cable and @xmath42 is the modulus of elasticity , then the additional tension @xmath9 in the cable produced by the live load @xmath22 and the corresponding energy @xmath43 are given by @xmath44    therefore , the total energy necessary to deform the cable is @xmath45    [ re ] when computing the energy @xmath46 , timoshenko - young obtain @xmath47 see ( * ? ? ?",

    "as explained in @xcite this may generate some significant errors in the solutions .",
    "it was the civil and structural german engineer franz dischinger who discovered around 1950 the dramatic consequences of this approximation on the structures .",
    "summarizing , the total energy in the system after the deformation @xmath23 is @xmath49 the euler - lagrange equation of the system is obtained by taking the critical points of the energy @xmath50 . then by recalling and that the beam is hinged at its endpoints , we obtain the following boundary value problem @xmath51    one should compare with the classical melan equation . for the history and the details on the derivation of the melan equation we also refer to the recent monograph @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we put @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54",
    ". then the problem reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 and the functional @xmath57 is as in , it is nonlinear nonlocal and of indefinite sign .",

    "the uniqueness statement holds if both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are sufficiently small .",
    "however , the assumption @xmath77 does not hold in general for actual bridges , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , we now discuss the case @xmath78 .",
    "first , we study what happens in the `` limit case '' where @xmath79 : the problem degenerates to @xmath80 clearly , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are two solutions of . but let us also analyze the functional @xmath57",
    ". we shift it by @xmath83 ( so that @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) and , for all @xmath86 , we define the real function @xmath87}dx\\qquad \\mbox { for any } t \\in \\mathbb{r}.\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath88 and @xmath89 is strictly convex in @xmath90 . since @xmath91 , there exist @xmath92 such that @xmath93 . hence ,",

    "we consider in order to simulate the behavior of the real three span suspension bridge already studied by wollmann @xcite .",
    "using his parameter values and his physical assumptions , we reduce our computations to the main span which is assumed to be @xmath102 long ; then we have @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "more , according to @xcite , we have @xmath109 . at last ,",

    "assuming that a _ uniform live load _ @xmath22 acts over the main span @xmath116 , we solved for many initial values of @xmath117 by using the _ bvptwp _ code , whose matlab version was published by cash et al .",
    "it is an optimized high - quality code for the numerical solution of two - point boundary value problems , which employs a mesh selection strategy based on the estimation of the local error . in practice ,",
    "a variable stepsize is used in order to obtain a solution with a relative error less than the required tolerance .",
    "we chose such tolerance @xmath118 .",
    "it is worth noticing that _ bvptwp _ requires that the problem is posed as a first - order system . for our computations , this is a great advantage , since it allows to have the discrete first derivative @xmath119 with the same accuracy of the solution @xmath120 .",
    "the main characteristics of the used code are that it implements high order methods using a deferred correction strategy and often works extremely efficiently on very difficult problems .",
    "instead , the iterative method presented by dang - luan @xcite solves the boundary value problem by a difference method of a second order convergence on uniform grid and then estimates the derivative of solution by finite difference approximations .",
    "we remark that a very good approximation of discrete derivative values are required in order to compute @xmath117 without increasing the global error .",
    "the algorithm by dang - luan @xcite does not seem to hit this target .     with a uniform live load on the whole beam ( left ) and on the left half of the beam ( right).[gwp1],width=430,height=151 ]    for each input @xmath121 ,",
    "an output @xmath122 is computed as follows : we solve with @xmath123 and we find @xmath124 and @xmath125 on a discrete mesh with stepsize @xmath126 , then we compute @xmath127 by means of the composite trapezoidal rule , which is of the second order , so we have an integration error which does not affect the global error .",
    "the map @xmath128 is plotted in figure [ gwp1 ] which shows that there exists a unique numerically unstable fixed point .",
    "this behavior remains the same for all the many values of @xmath22 we used .",
    "therefore we empirically conclude that a unique solution of exists .",
    "then we refined our computations and found value for which we have @xmath129 that we consider the required fixed point @xmath130 .",
    "for instance , we found the fixed points for different loads @xmath22 as shown in table [ fix ] .",
    "& & & & & + & & & & & + & & & & & +    it is worth noticing that since the problem appears numerically unstable , at least five significant digits have to be used . in all our experiments the map @xmath128 turned out to be strictly decreasing with very negative slope .",
    "this suggests the uniqueness of @xmath130 and , in turn , the uniqueness of the solution of .",
    ".[gwp2],width=419,height=143 ]    using @xmath131 we computed the numerical solutions of ( [ numequ ] ) . in the left picture in figure [ gwp2 ] , using the original scale for the @xmath132-axis , we report the solutions obtained for @xmath133 ( dashed line ) , @xmath134 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath135 ( solid line )",
    ". we also computed the maximal displacements @xmath13 and the gap @xmath136 between the first maximum and the central relative minimum , see table [ fix ] .",
    "then we studied a live load having a weight density of @xmath137 and located on the left half of the span ( e.g.  a train of length @xmath138 ) . in this case , the fixed point was computed to be @xmath139 and we obtained the solution of , which is an  almost \" skew - symmetric function , see the right one in figure [ gwp2 ] .",
    "compared with the case where a uniform load @xmath140 is on the whole beam , in the case where a uniform load @xmath140 only acts on the left half of the beam , the shape of the cable changes ( now it is not symmetrical with respect to @xmath141 ) and it results in a smaller increment length of the cable ( see @xmath130 in table [ fix ] ) .",
    "this produces a smaller upwards force ( due to the extension of the cable ) acting on the beam , and hence , the maximal displacement is larger than that under a uniform load @xmath22 on the whole beam , see table [ fix ] .",
    "overall , it is clear that the qualitative behavior of the solutions simulated by our nonlinear model is not close to those of the linear model , which exhibits a unique maximum .",
    "hence our results do not agree with the results reported by semper @xcite , referring to his nonlinear model .",
    "indeed our solutions show that the downwards deflection ( assumed downwards positive ) presents two ( equal ) maxima and one relative minimum in between , instead of a unique maximum at the middle span , as reported by semper @xcite .",
    "indeed , semper finds a small but not negligible discrepancy between the linear and the nonlinear equations , but for him this implies a quantitative difference only , whereas we find a significant qualitative difference also .    finally , we considered the equation ( [ numequ ] ) by dropping all the denominators and the third term ( involving the first order derivative ) .",
    "the resulting equations reads @xmath142 the fixed point was @xmath143 instead of 0.11966 as for ( [ numequ ] ) whereas the solution had a unique maximum computed equal to @xmath144 .",
    "this striking difference gives strength to remark [ re ] , that is , one can not neglect the curvature of the main cable .",
    "since @xmath66 is bounded and @xmath145 , the scalar product induces a norm on @xmath64 denoted by @xmath146 which is equivalent to @xmath147 , that is , the standard @xmath148-norm . for all @xmath149 we have",

    "in addition , the simple inequality @xmath151 implies that for any @xmath152 @xmath153 .",
