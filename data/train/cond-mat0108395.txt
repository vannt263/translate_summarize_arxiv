    "cloud base height profiles ( cbhp ) are known to have highly fluctuating and irregular structure .",
    "the dynamics of cbhp evolution is determined by a variety of processes in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this irregular structure is a benchmark for nonlinear dynamical processes .",
    "we apply the multifractal approach to study the scaling properties of the cbhp . in this report",
    "we present an analysis of the multi - affine properties of a cbhp signal @xmath1 ( fig.1 ) measured with a ground - based laser ceilometer having a temporal resolution of 30 seconds , taken on september 23 - 25 , 1997 at the southern great plains ( sgp ) ( oklahoma , usa ) site of the atmospheric radiation mesurement program of the department of energy .",
    "first , we tested the scaling properties of the power spectral density @xmath2 of the cbhp signal and obtained ( figure not shown ) that @xmath3 with @xmath4 for frequencies lower than 1/15 min@xmath5 and @xmath6 for higher frequencies .",
    "the multi - affine properties of @xmath1 can be described by the so - called `` q - th '' order structure functions @xcite @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , where the averages are taken over all possible pairs of points that are @xmath9 apart from each other with @xmath10 . assuming a power law dependence of the structure function , the @xmath11 spectrum is defined through @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "the _ intermittency _ of the signal can be studied through the so - called singular measure analysis .",
    "the first step that this technique requires is defining a basic measure @xmath14 as @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , where @xmath17 is the small - scale gradient field and @xmath18 it should be noted that we use spatial / temporal averages rather than ensemble averages , thus making an ergodicity assumption @xcite as our only recourse in such an empirical data analysis .",
    "next we define a series of ever more coarse - grained and ever shorter fields @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the average measure in the interval @xmath22 $ ] is @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) the scaling properties of the generating function are then searched for through @xmath25 , for @xmath26 .",
    "thus the multi - fractal properties of the cbhp signal are expressed by two sets of scaling functions , @xmath11 describing the roughness of the signal and @xmath27 describing its intermittency .",
    "the intermittency of the signal can be also expressed through the generalized dimensions @xmath28 as introduced by grassberger @xcite and hentschel and procaccia , @xcite @xmath29    the multi - affinity of @xmath1 means that one should use different scaling factors @xmath30 in order to rescale such a signal .",
    "this also implies that _ local _ roughness exponents @xmath31 exist @xcite at different scales .",
    "the density of the points @xmath32 that have the same roughness exponent is assumed @xcite to scale over the time span @xmath33 as @xmath34 from ref .",
    "@xcite the following relations are found : @xmath35 and @xmath36 in fig .",
    "3 the cbhp multi - affine properties are presented via the @xmath0-curve .",
    "we have demonstrated the multi - affine structure of cloud base height profiles .",
    "further work will be directed toward relating these statistical parameters to the dynamical properties of the clouds , an important step toward understanding , modeling and predicting their dynamical behaviour .",
