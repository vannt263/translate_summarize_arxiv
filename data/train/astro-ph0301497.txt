    "the presence or lack of a feature in the spectrum of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is key in determining the nature of these particles and their sources .",
    "astrophysical proton sources distributed homogeneously in the universe produce a feature in the spectrum due to the production of pions off the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this feature , consisting of a rather sharp suppression of the flux , occurs at energies above @xmath5 ev , as a result of the threshold in the production of pions in the final state of a proton - photon inelastic interaction .",
    "this important prediction was made independently by greisen and by zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectral feature is now known as the gzk cutoff ( or feature , as we prefer to call it ) .",
    "alternative models for uhecr sources that involve new physical processes may evade the presence of this feature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent reviews on the origin and propagation of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays can be found in @xcite , while a recent review of the observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the detection of cosmic ray events with energy above @xmath6 ev does not necessarily imply that the gzk feature is not present : what characterizes the presence of the gzk feature is the relative number of events above and below @xmath7 when both sides of the spectrum can be accurately determined .",
    "the steep injection spectra required to fit the observations below @xmath7 imply that only a handfull of events above @xmath8 ev can be detected during the operation time of experiments such as agasa and hires .",
    "this makes the identification of the gzk feature by these experiments extremely difficult .",
    "the problem is exacerbated by the fluctuations due to the discreteness of the process of photo - pion production , as will be discussed below .",
    "these uncertainties need to be considered when attempting a determination of the best fit injection spectrum of the particles , and in order to quantify the statistical significance of the presence or absence of the gzk feature in the observed spectrum .",
    "the discrepancy between the results of the two largest experiments has generated much debate .",
    "agasa @xcite reports a higher number of events above @xmath7 than expected while hires@xcite reports a flux consistent with the gzk feature . here",
    "we investigate in detail the statistical significance of this discrepancy as well as the significance of the presence or absence of the gzk feature in the data .",
    "we find that neither experiment has the necesseray statistics to establish if the spectrum of uhecrs has a gzk feature .",
    "in addition , a systematic error in the energy determination of the two experiments seems to be required in order to make the two sets of observations compatible in the low energy range , @xmath9 ev , where enough events have been detected to make the measurements reliable .",
    "the combined systematic errors in the energy determination is likely to be @xmath1 .",
    "if we decrease the agasa energies by @xmath10 while increasing hires energies also by @xmath10 , the two experiments predict compatible fluxes at energies below @xmath7 and at energies above @xmath7 the fluxes are within @xmath11 of each other . in this case , the best fit injection spectrum has a spectral index of @xmath4 but a determination of the gzk feature has very low significance .",
    "the detection or non - detection of the gzk feature in the cosmic ray spectrum remains open to investigation by future generation experiments , such as the pierre auger project @xcite and the euso @xcite and owl@xcite experiments .",
    "this paper is planned as follows : in  2 we describe our simulations . in ",
    "3 we illustrate the present observational situation , limiting ourselves to agasa and hiresi , and compare the data to the predictions of our simulations . we conclude in  4 .",
    "we assume that ultra - high energy cosmic rays are protons injected with a power - law spectrum in extragalactic sources .",
    "the injection spectrum is taken to be of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spectral index , @xmath14 is a normalization constant , and @xmath15 is the maximum energy at the source . here",
    "we fix @xmath16 ev , large enough not to affect the statistics at much lower energies .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the induced spectrum of a uniform distribution of sources in space is almost indistinguishable from a distribution with the observed large scale structure in the galaxy distribution .",
    "based on this result , we assume a spatially uniform distribution of sources and do not take into account luminosity evolution in order to avoid the introduction of additional parameters .",
    "we simulate the propagation of protons from source to observer by including the photo - pion production , pair production , and adiabatic energy losses due to the expansion of the universe . in each step of the simulation",
    ", we calculate the pair production losses using the continuous energy loss approximation given the small inelasticity in pair production ( @xmath17 ) . for the rate of energy loss due to pair production at redshift @xmath18 , @xmath19",
    ", we use the results from @xcite . at a given reshift @xmath20 , @xmath21",
    "similarly , the rate of adiabatic energy losses due to redshift is calculated in each step using @xmath22^{1/2}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 .",
    "the photo - pion production is simulated in a way similar to that described in ref .  @xcite . in each step , we first calculate the average number of photons able to interact via photo - pion production through the expression : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the interaction length for photo - pion production of a proton with energy @xmath26 at redshift @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a step size , chosen to be much smaller than the interaction length ( typically we choose @xmath29 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : il ] we plot the interaction length for photopion production used in @xcite ( solid thin line ) , and in @xcite ( triangles ) .",
    "the dashed line is the result of our calculations ( see below ) , which is in perfect agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the apparent discrepancy at energies below @xmath30 ev with the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite is only due to the fact that we consider only microwave photons as background , while in @xcite the infrared background was also considered . for our purposes , this difference is irrelevant as can be seen from the loss lengths plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : il ] .",
    "the rightmost thick solid line is the loss length for photopion production @xcite , while the other thick solid line is the loss length for pair production . in the present calculations",
    ", we do not use the loss length of photopion production which is related to the interaction length through an angle averaged inelasticity .",
    "unlike what was done in @xcite , in the current simulations we evaluate the inelasticity for each single proton - photon scattering using the kinematics , rather than adopting an angle averaged value .",
    "we calculate the interaction length , @xmath31 , as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number density of the cmb photons per unit energy at energy @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the velocity of the proton , @xmath36 is the cosine of the interaction angle , and @xmath37 is the total cross section for photo - pion production for the squared center of mass energy @xmath38    for the calculation of the interaction length we adopt the @xmath39 cross section given in @xcite , considering only the photons of the cosmic microwave background as targets . the calculated interaction length ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : il ] ) is in good agreement with the interaction length calculated in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "once the interaction length is known , we then sample a poisson distribution with mean @xmath40 , to determine the actual number of photons encountered during the step @xmath28 .",
    "when a photo - pion interaction occurs , the energy @xmath41 of the photon is extracted from the planck distribution , @xmath42 , with temperature @xmath43 , where @xmath44 k is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background at present .",
    "since the microwave photons are isotropically distributed , the interaction angle , @xmath45 , between the proton and the photon is sampled randomly from a distribution which is flat in @xmath46",
    ". clearly only the values of @xmath41 and @xmath45 that generate a center of mass energy above the threshold for pion production are considered .",
    "the energy of the proton in the final state is calculated at each interaction from kinematics .",
    "the simulation is carried out until the statistics of events detected above some energy reproduces the experimental numbers . by normalizing the simulated flux by the number of events above an energy where experiments have high statistics",
    ", we can then ask what are the fluctuations in numbers of events above a higher energy where experimental results are sparse .",
    "the fits are therefore most sensitive to the energy regions below @xmath7 and give a good estimate of the uncertainties in the present experiments for energies above @xmath7 . in this way we have a direct handle on the fluctuations that can be expected in the observed flux due to the stochastic nature of photo - pion production and to cosmic variance .",
    "the simulation proceeds in the following way : a source distance is generated at random from a uniform distribution in a universe with @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in a euclidean universe , the flux from a source would scale as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the distance between the source and the observer .",
    "on the other hand , the number of sources between @xmath50 and @xmath51 would scale as @xmath52 , so that the probability that a given event has been generated by a source at distance @xmath50 is independent of @xmath50 : sources at different distances have the same probability of generating any given event . in a flat universe with a cosmological constant ,",
    "this is still true provided the distance @xmath50 is taken to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the age of the universe when the event was generated , @xmath55 is the present age of the universe , and @xmath56 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "once a source distance has been selected at random , a particle energy is also assigned from a distribution that reflects the injection spectrum , chosen as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inj ] ) .",
    "this particle is then propagated to the observer and its energy recorded .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the number of events above a threshold energy , @xmath57 is reproduced . with this procedure",
    "we can assess the significance of results from present experiments with limited statistics of events .",
    "there is an additional complication in that the aperture of the experiment usually depends on energy .",
    "this is taken into account by allowing the event to be detected or not detected depending upon the function @xmath58 that describes the energy dependence of the aperture .",
    "we only study the spectrum above @xmath2 ev where the flux is supposed to be dominated by extragalactic sources . for this energy range , we focus on the experiments that have the best statistics : agasa and hiresi . for the agasa experiment",
    "the exposure is basically flat above @xmath59 ev , while for hires the exposure is as plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : hiresexp ] ) @xcite .",
    "for agasa data , the simulation is stopped when the number of events above @xmath60 ev equals 866 . for",
    "hires this number is 300 . note that while for agasa the number of detected events actually corresponds to the generated events , for hires the number of detected events requires a correction due to the energy dependence of the aperture @xmath58 .",
    "this correction allows one to reconstruct the observed spectrum .",
    "the statistical error in the energy determination is accounted for in our simulation by generating a _ detection _ energy chosen at random from a gaussian distribution centered at the arrival energy @xmath26 and with width @xmath61 for both experiments .",
    "our simulations reproduce well the predictions of analytical calculations , in particular at the energies where energy losses may be approximated as continuous . in fig .",
    "[ fig : an ] , we compare the results of our simulation with analytical calculations carried out as in ref .",
    "the curves plotted in the figure are the so called modification factors , defined in @xcite for three different values of the source redshift ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 from top to bottom ) .",
    "the differential injection spectrum is taken to be a power law @xmath65 .",
    "the points with error bars are the results of our simulations with @xmath66 particles produced by sources at the redshifts given above .",
    "the agreement between the simulated and analytical calculations at low energies is clear . at the energies where photo - pion production becomes important , simulations predict a slightly larger flux than analytical calculations",
    "this is a well known result , and is due to the discreteness of photo - pion energy losses , that allow some particles to reach the detector without appreciable losses .",

    "however , no evidence for such a feature has been found in the agasa experiment .",
    "we compared the data with theoretical predictions for the propagation of uhecrs on cosmological distances with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "we find that the very low statistics of the presently available data hinders any statistically significant claim for either detection or the lack of the gzk feature .",
    "a comparison of the spectra obtained from agasa and hiresi shows a systematic shift of the two data sets , which may be interpreted as a systematic error in the relative energy determination of about @xmath71 .",

    "the fit to the data with energy above @xmath59 ev is probably less susceptible to contamination by a possible galactic flux . in this case",
    "the agasa departure from the expected gzk feature is , as stressed above , at the level of about @xmath76 .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties derived from the simulations , attributed to the discreteness of the photo - pion production and to cosmic variance , this discrepancy becomes even less significant ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "it is clear that , if confirmed by future experiments with much larger statistics , the increase in flux relative to the gzk prediction hinted by agasa would be of great interest .",
    "this may signal the presence of a new component at the highest energies that compensates for the expected suppression due to photo - pion production , or the effect of new physics in particle interactions ( for instance the violation of lorentz invariance or new neutrino interactions ) .    identifying the cause of the systematic energy and/or flux shift between",

    "this discrepancy has stimulated a number of efforts to search for the source of these systematic errors including the construction of hybrid detectors , such as auger , that utilize both ground arrays and fluorescence detectors .",

    "both experiments are consistent with a gzk feature with large error bars .",
    "the agasa excess is at the level of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 if the observational uncertainties are also taken into account ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the correction by @xmath10 in the error determination implies that the best fit injection spectrum becomes basically the same for both experiments ( @xmath70 ) .    with the low statistical significance of either the excess flux seen by agasa or the discrepancies between agasa and hiresi , it is inaccurate to claim either the detection of the gzk feature or the extension of the uhecr spectrum beyond @xmath7 at this point in time . a new generation of experiments is needed to finally give a clear answer to this question . in fig .",
