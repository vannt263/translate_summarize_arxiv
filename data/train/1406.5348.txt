    "the precise nature of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration remains an outstanding puzzle in solar physics , to which two broad classes of process are thought to contribute ( namely , wave - based and reconnection - based , see e.g. erdlyi & ballai @xcite , cranmer @xcite , @xcite , hansteen & velli @xcite ) . in the wave - driven models , it is typically proposed that propagating alfvnic waves are responsible for the transport of magnetoconvective energy upward into the solar corona , guided along regions of predominantly open magnetic flux , such as polar coronal holes .",
    "this mechanical energy is then subsequently deposited as thermal energy via various ancillary dissipation mechanisms such as phase mixing ( heyvaerts & priest @xcite ) , resonant absorption ( e.g. goossens et al .",
    "@xcite ) , wave interactions and turbulent cascade ( e.g. matthaeus et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and nonlinear compressibility , steepening and shock formation ( e.g. ofman & davila @xcite , suzuki & inutsuka @xcite ) . note that in this context the term alfvnic wave is used in the broad sense of a transverse , magnetic - tension - driven magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave ; the specific identity of such waves is dependent on the structuring of the wave - guide ( see e.g. , erdlyi & fedun @xcite , van doorsselaere et al .",
    "@xcite , goossens et al . ) .",
    "determining the prevalence of transverse mhd waves and their energetic properties in the open - field corona is therefore of particular importance with regards to validating heating models and assessing their contribution compared to other mechanisms . to date , the majority of quantifiable evidence for transverse mhd waves propagating in coronal holes is indirect , obtained via measuring the non - thermal broadening of spectral lines ( see banerjee et al .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . despite the challenges in separating observed line - broadening into thermal and non - thermal contributions ( dolla & solomon )",
    "many studies have shown non - thermal velocities ( @xmath10 ) that are consistent with the presence of alfvnic waves and have reported large ranges of @xmath10 , which vary with altitude ( e.g. doschek & feldman reported @xmath11 km s@xmath3 at 30 above the limb , whereas hahn & savin @xcite find @xmath12 km s @xmath3 at around 190 ) . the reported non - thermal velocities have also been found to vary between plume and inter - plume plasma by banerjee et al .",
    "( ) , where higher non - thermal velocities are reported in the inter - plume regions .",
    "spectroscopic studies have also shown that with increasing altitude , beyond around @xmath13 , these non - thermal velocities begin to fall short of the trend that is expected for undamped alfvnic waves ( @xmath14 ) and this has been interpreted as evidence of alfvnic wave damping at sufficiently low altitudes to permit significant contributions to heating and acceleration ( bemporad & abbo @xcite , hahn et al .",
    "@xcite , hahn & savin @xcite ) .",
    "despite this abundance of spectroscopic evidence , direct detection and measurement of transverse waves propagating in coronal holes via imaging is desirable because other non - oscillatory mass motions may also contribute to @xmath10 .",
    "although transverse waves have been found to be ubiquitous elsewhere in the sun , such as in chromospheric structures ( see , e.g. de pontieu et al .",
    "@xcite , morton et al .",
    "@xcite ) prominences ( e.g. hillier et al .",
    "@xcite ) and in coronal loops ( see , e.g. aschwanden et al .",
    "@xcite , aschwanden & schrijver @xcite , white & verwichte ) so far only one paper has considered the presence of transverse waves in the faint , plume - like structures visible in euv above coronal holes .",
    "mcintosh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) demonstrated that signatures of transverse wave motion could be found in off - limb structures using data from _ solar dynamics observatory s atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( sdo / aia data ) and they determined that the observational data was visually compatible with synthetic data created by monte carlo simulation of oscillating features with velocity amplitudes of 25@xmath155 km s@xmath3 uniformly distributed across a period range 150 - 550 s. these parameters imply that the observed waves carry sufficient energy flux to facilitate solar wind acceleration ( models require @xmath16 w  m@xmath8 of wave energy flux near the coronal base to match empirical data , see , e.g. , withbroe @xcite , hansteen & leer @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that whilst comparison to a monte carlo simulation can be informative ( acting to constrain key parameters ) , direct measurements of the amplitudes and periodicities of these oscillations are still a necessity .",
    "this letter addresses this need and presents the first direct measurements of transverse wave motion in the faint , off - limb plume - like features that can be resolved by the sdo / aia . in this letter",
    ", we present measurements of 595 transverse oscillations seen in the 171  channel of aia at 5 different altitudes above the solar limb during a 4 hour period .",
    "we detail the observations and methods used in section [ methods ] , present our results in section [ results ] and briefly discuss their implications in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider sdo / aia data taken in the 171@xmath17 channel around the northern pole on 6@xmath18 august 2010 between 00:00 ut and 04:00 ut ( figure [ referencemap ] ) .",
    "the data has pixel size of 0.59 , a cadence of 12 s , and a 2.7 s exposure time .",
    "the alignment of the data was tested using the idl routine _ fg_rigidalign.pro _ which showed that frame - to - frame jitter was consistently smaller than the displacement accuracy of the alignment routine ( this was found to be the case for all coalignment windows tested ) . thus no alignment is required , although we do account for sub - pixel jitter as a source of uncertainty in our analysis ( section [ methods2 ] ) .",
    "no derotation is performed , as rotation near the poles is negligible compared to the feature lifetimes . to better reveal the off - limb features , the data is subject to an unsharp masking procedure ,",
    "in which each image in the sequence has a @xmath19 boxcar - smoothed image removed from itself .",
    "this preserves the finer features whilst removing those at larger scales .",
    "the resulting sequence is then further smoothed over 3 time steps , which suppresses frame - to - frame variations in intensity and aids the fitting routine described in section [ methods2 ] . in the enhanced data ,",
    "we clearly see off - limb plume structures which often exhibit transverse motion by eye ( figure [ referencemap ] and supplementary movie ) .",
    "we measure transverse oscillations of these structures by considering time - series data from 5 synthetic slits , which are 200-pixels long and placed at increasing altitudes above the limb ( see figure [ referencemap ] for positions and table [ table ] for altitude information ) . to improve s / n",
    ", the intensity at each position is taken as the mean of the slit intensity across the 5 pixels ( i.e. artificial slits of @xmath20 pixels are created from @xmath21 pixel data cut - outs ) .",
    "an example of the resulting time - distance diagrams is shown in figure [ timedistancemap ] .",
    "they are characterised by intermittent bright streaks ( corresponding to the location of the over - dense , plume structures ) which , by eye , exhibit clear signs of transverse motion , many of which appear to oscillate sinusoidally for one or more cycles . on visual inspection",
    "it is clear that these oscillations are not all similar , in the sense that it appears as if there is a distribution of oscillations with different periods and displacement amplitudes , and this is further complicated by variable feature lifetimes .    to detect the central position of the plume axes with sub - pixel accuracy , and follow their evolution through the time series",
    ", we employ an automated gaussian - fitting method developed by morton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and morton & mclaughlin ( ) .",
    "first , for each time , local intensity peaks in x ( position along slit ) are located for a 10-pixel neighbourhood , whereby a crawling algorithm checks all neighbourhoods @xmath22 .",
    "then , the gradients either side of the determined location are checked against a threshold gradient of 0.5 .",
    "if the gradient is sufficient , the point is considered a local maxima .",
    "note that the threshold gradient is determined experimentally , by visually comparing the pixel - locations of maximum intensity against the time distance maps .",
    "once pixels containing local intensity maxima are determined , their position is then refined to sub - pixel accuracy by fitting the 5-pixel neighbourhood ( centered around the point ) with a gaussian .",
    "the fitting is weighted by aia 171  intensity errors which are taken as @xmath23 as per yuan & nakariakov ( ) , where @xmath24 is the pixel - intensity of the unaltered , level 1 data and a product of @xmath25 is taken because the time - distance diagrams are constructed from the average of 5-neighbouring slices .",
    "the uncertainty on the position of the local maxima is taken as the @xmath26 estimate on the position of the apex of the fitted gaussian and the uncertainty on position due to sub - pixel jitter , added in quadrature .",
    "the jitter is calculated as the root mean square of the frame - to - frame displacements calculated by _ fg_rigidalign.pro _ , which gives @xmath27 pixels .",
    "these local intensity maxima are then traced through the time series .",
    "finally , any followed threads which have less than 20 points ( persist for less than 240 s ) are rejected .    on inspection",
    ", these automatically - detected threads show clear signs of oscillatory behaviour as per our earlier visual impression from the time - distance diagrams .",
    "using levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization ( markwardt @xcite ) we fit the data with a sinusoid and linear trend , i.e. a function of the form @xmath28=\\xi\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{p } + \\varphi \\right ) + at + b \\,,\\ ] ] from which we determine the maximum transverse displacement @xmath29 , the period @xmath30 , and thus calculate the maxiumum velocity amplitude @xmath31 . because the tracking - routine picks up threads of variable lengths ( ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33 time - steps or , due to variable feature lifetimes ) , longer threads can often be fitted with different oscillations during different stages of their lifetime , and it is often the case that shorter - period oscillations can be seen super - imposed upon longer period trends .",
    "thus , where multiple fits to different subsections of a longer thread are possible , all such fits are taken and contribute to the sample , provided they meet the following selection criteria ( which applies to all fits made ) :    * at least @xmath34 of an oscillatory cycle must be observed .",
    "* the fit must be made using more than 5 points ( this effectively renders the minimum period of oscillation around 60 s ) .",
    "* fits dependent on a set of points that includes a jump of more than 2.5-pixels from point - to - point are discounted , as this constitutes an instantaneous transverse velocity of greater than 100 km s@xmath3 which is an order of magnitude greater than the representative velocity amplitudes measured for all samples ( even when this criteria is relaxed ) .",
    "there is no restriction on maximum transverse displacements measured , but transverse motion must be well - resolved , otherwise it is thought that such jumps are artefacts from the thread - following algorithm .",
    "* errors on fitted parameters must not be comparable in magnitude to the fitted parameter itself . in practice",
    ", we reject a fit if the fractional error on velocity amplitude @xmath35 .",
    "the measurements made for slit 1 are shown in figure [ timedistancemap ] and , as a typical example , 4 fits are shown in further detail in figure [ example_fits ] .",
    "the detection and fitting procedure detailed in section [ methods ] is applied to 5 slits placed at different altitudes above the limb .",
    "information regarding slit position , number of threads detected and number of fitted oscillations is summarised in table [ table ] . at higher altitudes ,",
    "fewer threads are detected and followed throughout the time - distance diagram .",
    "this is because at higher altitudes many of the smaller plumes become increasingly diffuse and thus have poorer contrast against the backgrounds of the time - distance diagrams ( cf .",
    "figure [ referencemap ] and column 3 of table [ table ] ) .    for all 5 slits",
    ", we find a broad distribution of oscillations with transverse displacements ranging from of @xmath36 to @xmath37 km , periods of @xmath38 to @xmath39 s , and velocity amplitudes of @xmath40 to @xmath41 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the mean values for transverse displacement @xmath29 , period @xmath30 and velocity amplitude @xmath42 are given for each slit in table [ table ] .",
    "within the standard deviations , there is no appreciable change in mean parameters at different altitudes . given this ,",
    "if we pool all 596 measurements we find a mean displacement of @xmath43 km , mean periods @xmath44 s , and mean velocity amplitudes @xmath45 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , due to the relatively broad range of measured parameters , these simple averages may be sensitive to outliers and may not be completely representative of the distribution of measurements .    upon constructing histograms for each slit , we find that the distribution of all three parameters typically has a positive skew , with long period , large displacement and large amplitude measurements occurring infrequently in the tail ( see figure [ distro ] ) .",
    "we find that a logarithmic - normal distribution fits the observed distribution well , from which we can infer an alternative quantitative description of the measured parameters . from figure [ distro ]",
    "we see that the distribution for slit 1 peaks at a transverse displacement of @xmath0 km , period of @xmath1 s and velocity amplitude of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ( modes ) and has ( log - normal ) mean @xmath15 standard deviation parameters of @xmath4 km , @xmath5 s and @xmath6 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this log - normal mean can be thought of as a weighted mean according to the fitted probability distribution function .",
    "this distribution ( and figure [ distro ] ) is also representative of slits 2 and 3 , qualitatively in that the data is positively skewed , and quantitatively in that the mode , median and mean of the parameters are similar ( see table [ table ] ) .",
    "however , histograms for slits 4 and 5 prove to be too underpopulated to convincingly fit any distribution function .",
    "nonetheless , for all slits it is clear that transverse oscillations are detected with different displacements , periods and velocity amplitudes that occur in a fairly broad range , but that , at least for slits 1 - 3 , displacements of around @xmath0 km , periods of around @xmath1 s , and velocity amplitudes of around @xmath2 km s@xmath3 are most commonly observed .",
    "in this letter , we find that transverse mhd waves propagate in solar off - limb polar plumes with parameter values that are non - uniformly distributed over a broad range , with transverse displacements from @xmath36 to @xmath37 km , periods from @xmath38 to @xmath39 s , and transverse velocities from @xmath40 to @xmath41 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we also detect multiple , superimposed oscillations of different amplitudes and periods .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the oscillations are excited in the lower solar atmosphere as wave packets of finite duration ( similar behaviour has also been seen for other magneto - acoustic waves , e.g. mcintosh & smillie @xcite ) .",
    "the measured parameter distributions have a significant positive skew and are well described by a log - normal distributions .",
    "our findings for arithmetic and log - normal mean parameters are generally smaller than ( but consistent within their standard deviations ) with previous results .",
    "for example , the monte carlo simulations of mcintosh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) indicated that periods of @xmath46 s and velocity amplitudes of @xmath47 km s@xmath3 were comparable to the typical features of the time - distance diagrams .",
    "our observed transverse velocity amplitudes are also broadly compatible within standard deviations with the non - thermal velocities reported in plume plasma by banerjee et al .",
    "( ) , who reported @xmath48 km s@xmath3 and @xmath49 km s@xmath3 ( for 195  and 202  lines of eis respectively ) at an altitude of around @xmath50 mm . assuming that this non - thermal velocity measurement contains contributions from both transverse and torsional mhd waves , this comparability suggests that torsional alfvn waves may not strongly contribute to plume non - thermal velocity measurements ( otherwise we would expect @xmath51 to be larger )",
    ". however , it is important to note that whether this is due to a lack of larger amplitude torsional motions in plumes or simply that they are present but their line - of - sight motions are under - resolved by current spectrometers is currently unclear .",
    "this letter now confirms by _ direct measurement _ that transverse waves with such velocity amplitudes and periodicities can occur at altitudes of around @xmath52 mm , however , we have found a broader range of parameters and thus the full picture is much richer .",
    "the technique used for the direct measurement of imaging data also overcomes the inability of the monte carlo method to reveal information on the nature of oscillations with displacements on the order of or smaller than the diffraction limit of sdo .",
    "it has been said that these waves carry enough energy flux to make a significant energy contribution ; as an estimation mcintosh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calculate an energy flux using the formula @xmath53 ( an equation for alfvn waves in a homogeneous plasma , where coronal density is taken as @xmath54\\times10^{-13}$ ] kg m@xmath55 and phase - speed as @xmath56 km s@xmath3 ) . by assuming a filling factor of @xmath57",
    ", they find @xmath58  w  m@xmath8 , which is compatible with the wave energy requirement for solar wind acceleration . however , because we have found a broad distribution of parameters which is skewed in favour of relatively smaller amplitude waves , we can now take the whole range of parameters into account when calculating @xmath59 .",
    "appropriate weighting can be given to the range of velocity amplitudes by taking the volume filling velocity @xmath42 to be the log - normal mean ( i.e. , @xmath60 where @xmath24 is the log - normal probability density function ; evaluated over the whole range ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a weighted average .",
    "for slit 1 we find @xmath61 w m@xmath8 ; a quarter of the previous estimate .",
    "furthermore , this calculation is an overestimation in that it does not provide the time averaged energy flux .",
    "replacing the ( maximum ) velocity term with its mean value over a period introduces a factor of @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath63 , giving @xmath64 w m@xmath8 which indicates that the transverse waves transport a less significant amount of energy through the corona .",
    "this energy budget , determined by direct measurement , falls @xmath9 times below the minimum theoretical requirement .",
    "furthermore , it is calculated according to the equation for volume - filling alfvn waves in a homogeneous plasma , which corresponds to the most generous case in terms of energy flux .",
    "more realistic assumptions about the structuring and inhomogeneity of the medium would yield smaller energy fluxes still , as discussed by goossens et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , _ the evidence suggests that transverse waves in polar coronal holes are insufficiently energetic to be the dominant energy source of the fast solar wind_. crucially , our measurements show a deficit in the energy budget independently of the debate about the most appropriate theoretical model for these waves .",
    "contrary to the conclusions of mcintosh et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , unless there is a prevalence of large amplitude , short period transverse oscillations below the cadence of aia , transverse waves can not be the dominant energy source of the fast solar wind in the open - field corona and so we must now consider the contributions of alternative energy sources in coronal holes , whether it be other wave modes ( such as the aforementioned torsional alfvn waves ) or other non - wave processes .    whether our observed distributions are truly physically representative of transverse wave motion in solar polar plumes is an important question .",
    "for instance , it is likely that many shorter period oscillations are beyond the resolution of sdo / aia and that very large period oscillations are obscured by short feature lifetimes limiting observations of the lowest - frequency waves .",
    "additionally , due to the presence of multiple , superimposed oscillations during a given feature s lifetime , there is a possibility of over - sampling of the most visible parameter ranges . in this letter ,",
    "for longer lived plumes we have often been able to make one measurement of an oscillation of the order of its lifetime , and several measurements of faster oscillations . because we are measuring the signals of _ propagating waves _ ( packets",
    "as opposed to standing waves ) we have considered every oscillation that meets the fitting criteria in our sample and believe that the prevalence of relatively smaller parameter ranges is not due to oversampling or selection bias .",
    "regardless , the above calculation for @xmath65 illustrates that when assessing wave energy flux , it is important to consider the broadband , ensemble behaviour of the waves and their relevant prevalences .",
    "our observed distribution of parameters provides a point of comparison for future models of transverse waves propagating in coronal holes ( in the geometric / structuring sense of variable flux tube strengths , merging heights , canopy heights and driving motions throughout the hole ) , the need for which has been discussed by authors such as cranmer & van ballegooijen ( @xcite , their section 8) .    _",
