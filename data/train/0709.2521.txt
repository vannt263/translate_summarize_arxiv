    "our general aim is to turn spacetime theories into axiomatic theories of first - order logic ( ) and exhaustively investigate the relationship between the axioms and their consequences .    why is it useful to apply the axiomatic method to relativity theory ?",
    "for one thing , this method makes it possible for us to understand the role of any particular axiom ( that is , a basic assumption of the theory ) .",
    "we can check what happens to the theory if we drop , weaken or replace the axiom by its negation .",
    "for instance , it is shown by this method that the impossibility of faster than light motion is not independent from the other assumptions of special relativity ( ) , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( more boldly : it is superfluous as an axiom because it is provable as a theorem from much simpler and more convincing basic assumptions . )",
    "the linearity of the transformations between observers ( reference frames ) can also be proved from some plausible assumptions , see @xcite , @xcite and theorem [ thm - poi ] .",
    "moreover , we can discover new , interesting and physically relevant theories by this method .",
    "this happened in the case of the axiom of parallels in euclid s geometry ; this kind of investigation led to the discovery of hyperbolic geometry .    moreover , if we have an axiom system , we can ask which axioms are responsible for a certain consequence of the theory .",
    "this kind of reverse thinking can help us to answer the why - type questions of relativity .",
    "for example , we can take the twin paradox and check which axiom of sr was and which one was not needed to derive it .",
    "the weaker an axiom system is , the better answer it offers to the question : why is the twin paradox true ? .",
    "for more details on this kind of investigation into the twin paradox , see @xcite .",
    "we hope that we have given good reasons why we use the axiomatic method in our research into spacetime theories . for more details or further reasons ,",
    "see , e.g. , guts  @xcite , schutz  @xcite , suppes  @xcite .",
    "so far we have not said anything about why choosing fol instead of the so powerful second - order logic or any other abstract logic .",
    "the main reason comes from the fact that we would like to use an _ absolute _  logic for our investigations because obviously we do not want the consequence relation of the used logic to depend on set theory .",
    "that is clear since our main subject is this relation ; hence we want to understand its properties as clearly as possible , that is , as independently from set theory as possible .",
    "we would also like to use a _",
    "complete_logic since we would like to know that if something is true in all the possible models , it is also provable . by lindstrm",
    "s theorem , fol is the _",
    "_ strongest__possible compact logic with lvenheim - skolem property , see , e.g. , @xcite . obviously _",
    "compactness_follows from completeness .",
    "vnnen has proved that absolute logics have the _ lvenheim - skolem property _ , see @xcite .",
    "thus we do not have any better candidate than fol for our work .",
    "for further details of this reason or for other reasons for choosing fol for axiomatic foundation , see , e.g. , ax  @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "*   why fol ?  ) , vnnen @xcite , woleski @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on a well - known consequence of general relativity ( ) , the gravitational time dilation ( ) .",
    "gtd roughly says `` gravitation makes time flow slower . '' here we investigate the relationship of gtd and a version of sr extended with accelerated observers ( thus extended for simulating gravity ) .",
    "we use einstein s equivalence principle ( ) to treat gravitation in sr .",
    "eep roughly says that `` a uniformly accelerated frame of reference is indistinguishable from a rest frame in a uniform gravitational field , '' see , e.g. , einstein @xcite or dinverno  @xcite .",
    "so instead of gravitation we talk about acceleration .",
    "to investigate gtd in fol , we have to fix a language ( a set of basic concepts ) , present one or more axiom systems of sr and formulate gtd in this fixed language",
    ". then we can investigate the connection between gtd and the axiom systems by proving theorems and providing counterexamples . as an illustration of our research",
    ", we have partly fulfilled this task in @xcite . in this paper",
    "after recalling the axiom systems , definitions and theorems presented in @xcite , we concentrate on proving these theorems and developing the necessary tools to do so .",
    "although we develop the most important tools and prove most of the theorems that we have stated in @xcite , we do not go into every detail , and do not prove all the theorems stated in @xcite because that would make our paper too long .",
    "we try to be as self - contained as possible .",
    "first occurrences of concepts used in this work are set in boldface to make them easier to find .",
    "we also use colored text and boxes to help the reader to find the axioms , notations , etc . throughout this work , if - and - only - if is abbreviated to * iff*.",
    "let us now recall our first - order language and some of our axiom systems for sr .",
    "the motivation for our basic concepts is summarized as follows .",
    "here we only deal with the kinematics of relativity , that is , we deal with motion of _ bodies _",
    "( test - particles ) .",
    "we represent motion as changing spatial location in time . to do so , we have reference - frames for coordinatizing events ( sets of bodies ) .",
    "_ quantities _ are used for marking time and space .",
    "the structure of quantities is assumed to be an ordered field in place of the field of real numbers . for simplicity , we associate reference - frames with certain bodies called _ observers_.",
    "this observation is coded by the _ world - view relation_. we visualize an observer as `` sitting '' in the origin of the space part of its reference - frame , or equivalently , `` living '' on the time - axis of the reference - frame .",
    "we distinguish _ inertial observers _ from the others .",
    "we also use another special kind of bodies called _",
    "photons_.    allowing ordered fields in place of the field of reals increases the flexibility of our theory and minimizes the amount of our mathematical presuppositions . for further motivation in this direction ,",
    "see , e.g. , ax  @xcite .",
    "similar remarks apply to our flexibility - oriented decisions below , for example , the one to treat the dimension of spacetime as a variable .",
    "using observers in place of coordinate systems or reference frames is only a matter of didactic convenience and visualization .",
    "there are many reasons for using observers ( or coordinate systems , or reference - frames ) instead of a single observer - independent spacetime structure .",
    "one of them is that it helps us to weed unnecessary axioms from our theories ; but we state and emphasize the equivalence / duality between observer - oriented and observer - independent approaches to relativity theory , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above , now we turn to fixing the first - order language of our axiom systems .",
    "first we fix a natural number @xmath0 for the dimension of spacetime .",
    "our language contains the following non - logical symbols :    * unary relation symbols ( for * bodies * ) , ( for * observers * ) , ( for * inertial observers * ) , ( for * photons * ) and @xmath1 ( for * quantities * ) , * binary function symbols , and a binary relation symbol ( for the field operations and the ordering on @xmath2 ) and * a @xmath3-ary relation symbol ( for * world - view relation * ) .",
    "we read @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as `` @xmath9 is a body , '' `` @xmath9 is an observer , '' `` @xmath9 is an inertial observer , '' `` @xmath9 is a photon , '' `` @xmath9 is a quantity . ''",
    "we use the world - view relation @xmath10 to talk about coordinatization by reading @xmath11 as `` observer @xmath9 coordinatizes body @xmath12 at spacetime location @xmath13 , '' ( that is , at space location @xmath14 at instant @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the so - called atomic formulas of our first - order language , where @xmath18 can be arbitrary variables or terms built up from variables by using the field operations .",
    "the * formulas * of our first - order language are built up from these atomic formulas by using the logical connectives _ not _ ( ) , _ and _ ( ) , _ or _ ( ) , _ implies _ ( ) , _ if - and - only - if _ ( ) , and the quantifiers _ exists _ @xmath9 ( ) and _ for all @xmath9 _ ( ) for every variable @xmath9 .",
    "the * models * of this language are of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a nonempty set , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath2 are unary relations on @xmath20 , etc .",
    "a unary relation on @xmath20 is just a subset of @xmath20 .",
    "thus we use @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc .  as sets as well , for example , we write in place of @xmath25 .",
