    "in this study , we obtained temperature factor or beta factor using by tsallis statistical mechanics . in this framework , by the approximate scheme which we have used here , closed and analytical expressions for the generalized gaussian network model have been derived for harmonic oscillator .",
    "in addition to this , the temperature factor is q dependent . since the temperature factor must be positive",
    ", q must be less than unity .",
    "this also shows that q must be less than unity for harmonic oscillator system .",
    "as can be seen in fig.[eps1 ] , at q=0.99 , the beta factors which are obtained from experimental and numerical calculation are in agreement with each other .",
    "the more the q parameter decreases , the more the temperature factor disagrees with experimental data",
    ". therefore , for q values in the lower vicinity of 1 , the experimental data are in agreement with numerical calculations . in this system , as @xmath0 , it is observed that , both of the above expressions reduce to the results obtained in the standard boltzmann - gibbs statistics .",
