    "logarithmic conformal field theories in two dimensions  @xcite are attracting some attention from different standpoints : in the context closest to the subject of this paper , in  @xcite and , as regards the extended ( @xmath4-)algebras , in  @xcite ; in the context of boundary conformal field theories , in  @xcite ; mathematically , various aspects of logarithmic conformal models and related structures in vertex - operator algebras were considered in  @xcite ; relations to statistical - mechanics models have been studied in  @xcite ; various aspects of logarithmic models were elaborated in  @xcite ; relations to quantum groups and a `` nonsemisimple '' extension of the kazhdan  lusztig correspondence  @xcite were investigated in  @xcite .",
    "logarithmic conformal field theories can be viewed as an extension of rational conformal field theories  @xcite to the case involving indecomposable representations of the chiral algebra .",
    "identification of the chiral algebra itself requires some care in logarithmic models : in the known examples , starting with the pioneering works  @xcite , the chiral algebra is not the `` naive , '' manifest symmetry algebra ( e.g. , virasoro ) but its nonlinear extension , i.e. , some @xmath4-algebra ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    a systematic way to define",
    "a logarithmic conformal field theory model is to take the kernel of the differential in a complex associated with screening operators acting in appropriate free - field spaces . constructed this way , logarithmic models are a natural generalization of rational ones ( which are just the cohomology of the same differential , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but can also be defined in the case where the cohomology is trivial and therefore the rational model is empty  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , defining logarithmic models in terms of a kernel of screenings suggests chiral @xmath4-algebras of these models ; in the known @xmath17 and @xmath22 cases , the @xmath4-algebra that is the symmetry of the model is the maximum local algebra acting in the kernel .    in this paper ,",
    "the `` screening - based '' approach is used to logarithmically extend the well - known @xmath1 minimal models of integrable representations .",
    "part of the motivation is in the general popularity of wzw - related models and the possibility of constructing coset models in particular .",
    "but success is not guaranteed a priori .",
    "two _ related _ difficulties can be perceived in carrying the previously developed methods over to theories where the `` naive '' symmetry algebra ( the one that is manifest before identifying the @xmath4-algebra ) is an affine lie algebra .",
    "first , the characters acquire a dependence on @xmath23 , in addition to the modular parameter @xmath24 ; then , whenever the @xmath4-algebra characters involve derivatives of theta - functions ( which is a typical feature of logarithmic conformal field theories ) , predictable complications with modular transformation properties occur .",
    "second , representations multiply under the spectral flow action , to infinity in general ; this seems to take us even farther away from the rational class than the generous setting of logarithmic conformal field theory may allow .",
    "but the situation with infinitely many inequivalent representations produced by the spectral flow is in fact already encountered in the more familiar setting of admissible representations  @xcite of affine lie algebras , @xmath25 in particular . if the characters are understood in appropriate analytic - continuation terms , the number of the resulting _ character functions _ is finite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and , moreover , a finite - dimensional modular group representation is realized on them .",
    "an extra complication occurring in the logarithmic@xmath26nonsemisimple case is that the space of torus amplitudes is not exhausted by the characters , and therefore some other functions , which are not characters , come into play . in the `` @xmath27-free ''",
    "cases studied previously , these _ generalized characters _ typically had the form of characters times polynomials in  @xmath28 , with the degree of the polynomials determined by the jordan cell size  @xcite ; we have to see how this behavior is affected by the appearance of a @xmath27 variable . continuing with challenges encountered in the study of logarithmic conformal field theories",
    ", we mention that their @xmath4-symmetries are rather complicated .",
    "our aim is to report that despite these complications , it is nevertheless possible to achieve certain consistency in constructing logarithmic extensions of the minimal @xmath25 models following the strategy `` _ _",
    "screenings@xmath29kernel@xmath29 @xmath4-algebra@xmath29characters @xmath30generalized characters and modular transformations__. '' _ consistency _ here refers to modular transformations , whose closure is a very strong consistency check for various structures in conformal field theory .",
    "it has been observed in somewhat different situations in  @xcite ( and maybe elsewhere ) that the closure of a set of character functions under the spectral flow tends to imply their closure under modular transformations . to a certain extent , this is also the case with the proposed logarithmic @xmath25 theory , where , as in other logarithmic models , generalized characters occur in addition , but where also `` absorbing '' the explicit @xmath27 dependence requires introducing a matrix automorphy factor , i.e. , changing a ( right ) @xmath14-action @xmath31 , @xmath32 , into @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a function on @xmath35 ( matrix - valued if @xmath36 is a vector ) satisfying the cocycle condition @xmath37    we start with screenings that single out the @xmath25 algebra as their centralizer in a three - boson realization .",
    "there are two a priori inequivalent possibilities for this , involving either one bosonic and one fermionic or two fermionic screenings .",
    "the option chosen in this paper is the one with _ two fermionic screenings_.two fermionic screenings @xmath38 and @xmath39 give rise to complexes of a somewhat unusual    zh    -shape @xmath40{bfly2.eps}\\ ] ] which is an @xmath25 version of the butterfly resolution in  @xcite ( also see  @xcite ) .",
    "the sites denote twisted ( and typically highly reducible ) @xmath1-modules .",
    "the two types of arrows , north - east and south - east , correspond to the two fermionic screenings , whose composition gives the middle link . _ for positive integer @xmath41 , the two screenings commute with each other_. whenever the cohomology is nontrivial , it sits at the `` right eye '' ( @xmath42 ) and gives an integrable representation .",
    "we also construct and use several acyclic butterfly complexes .",
    "that the resolution involves @xmath25-representations of arbitrarily large twists leads to a number of problems ( e.g. , reasonably weighted sums of their characters diverge ) . in following the `` screenings@xmath29kernel@xmath29@xmath4-algebra@xmath43 '' strategy",
    ", we therefore take the kernels not in all the modules constituting the butterfly resolution but only in the untwisted ones ( those at the horizontal symmetry line ) . accordingly , the @xmath4-algebra that we identify maps only horizontally between the @xmath1-modules associated with the sites in  . the currents @xmath2 and @xmath3 generating the @xmath4-algebra are determined by singular vectors representing a highest - weight state of dimension @xmath5 and charge @xmath6 , and a ( @xmath44)-twisted highest - weight state of the same dimension @xmath5 and charge @xmath8 , where @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , we let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the @xmath25 generators ( with @xmath48={}k\\,m\\,\\delta_{m+n,0 } + 2{h}_{m+n}$ ] ) and write @xmath49{\\lambda;\\theta}\\right\\rangle}}{|{\\lambda;\\theta}\\rangle}{|{\\lambda;\\theta}\\rangle}{|{\\lambda;\\theta}\\rangle}}$ ] for a highest - weight vector with spin  @xmath50 and twist  @xmath51 ( see sec .   for the details ) .",

    "vertex - operator extensions have attracted some general interest , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "] we actually use the spectral flow to generate a set of character functions on which the modular group action may be expected to close if an appropriate number of generalized characters ( involving polynomials in  @xmath28 ) are added . in a sense , we compensate for the poorly known @xmath4-algebra representation theory by seeking a modular group representation generated from a set of those @xmath4-algebra characters that we can explicitly evaluate by honest representation theory .",
    "the precise result is as follows .",
    "the modular group representation generated from @xmath4-algebra characters in the logarithmic @xmath1 model with positive integer @xmath45 is a deformation , via a matrix automorphy factor , of the direct sum @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath60-dimensional @xmath14 representation on the integrable @xmath1 characters , @xmath15 is a @xmath61-dimensional representation , @xmath62 is the defining two - dimensional representation , and @xmath63 is its symmetrized square ; the matrix automorphy factor becomes equal to the identity matrix at @xmath64 .",
    "fulfilling the general expectation  @xcite , we next show ( theorem  ) that the hamiltonian reduction indeed relates the logarithmic @xmath1 to the logarithmic @xmath65 models : _ the @xmath4-algebra generators in   and   map under the hamiltonian reduction to generators of the triplet @xmath4-algebra  @xcite of the @xmath17 logarithmic model _ , which were defined in  @xcite in terms of a virasoro screening .",
    "we note that the @xmath14 representation on generalized characters in the logarithmic @xmath17 model was evaluated as @xmath66 in  @xcite ; the hamiltonian reduction argument , in particular , `` explains '' the occurrence of @xmath59 there .",
    "minimal models and , in particular , gave evidence in favor of the existence of a @xmath4-algebra in these models . ]",
    "the total dimension @xmath18 of the @xmath14-representation in   is a likely candidate for the dimension of the space of torus amplitudes , if such a finite - dimensional space can be constructed at all following one of the more direct approaches .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the @xmath19 tensor factors entering   suggest the jordan cell sizes to be encountered in indecomposable @xmath4-algebra modules .",
    "the @xmath27 variable in the argument of the characters can in hindsight be seen to result in producing deformations of direct sums of @xmath14 representations .",
    "the @xmath67-dimensional space spanned by the @xmath4-algebra characters @xmath68 and the integrable @xmath1-representation characters @xmath69 is extended to the @xmath11-dimensional space in   due to two mechanisms .",
    "first , the spectral flow closes if @xmath9 functions @xmath70 , @xmath56 , are added . we treat them on equal footing with characters , although their representation - theory meaning is not discussed here .",
    "second , as with the `` @xmath27-free '' characters of logarithmic conformal field theories known previously  @xcite , certain combinations of the @xmath57 , @xmath71 , @xmath70 become parts of multiplets , i.e. , transform in representations of the form @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is some @xmath14 representation and @xmath19 is @xmath62 or @xmath63 realized on polynomials in @xmath28 of the respective degrees @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "but it then turns out that the explicit occurrences of the @xmath27 variable in modular transformation formulas results not only in `` mixing '' different modular - group representations with each other but also in proliferating the number of functions involved , as is already clear from the @xmath76 transformations introducing a fractional - linear factor .",
    "this behavior can be `` absorbed '' into a matrix automorphy factor , isolating which leaves us just with the representation in  .-representation of course reflects certain `` pathologies '' inherent in the adopted setting , where the number of free fields ( @xmath21 ) is larger than the number of screenings  ( @xmath75 ) . as can be seen in  @xcite , a more natural object from the `` screening@xmath26quantum - group '' standpoint",
    "may be given by the coset  @xmath77 , but we leave its `` logarithmization '' for the future . ]",
    "we fix the level @xmath78 as any complex number not equal to @xmath79 in sec .   and as @xmath80 ( and occasionally @xmath81 ) starting with  .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath45 , with the apologies for a certain lack of consistency , in that a formula or two neighboring formulas may contain both @xmath78 and @xmath82 .",
    "similar negligence is shown regarding another global notation , @xmath83 : both @xmath34 and @xmath84 are used interchangeably .",
    "the paper contains quite a few pictures of the subquotient structure of the relevant modules and maps between them .",
    "an alternative way of delivering the same information would be a comparable abundance of formal notation , making sense out of which would anyway require some visualization .",
    "the reader inclined to giving each object a special name and a defining formula that makes all the parameters explicit must be able to reconstruct the details from the numerous labels in the pictures  ( e.g. , as in fig .",

    "the extension to rational  @xmath78 may turn out to be easier to achieve in the `` nonsymmetric '' bosonization of @xmath25 , with one bosonic and one fermionic screenings , but this task seems to be rather involved anyway .",
    "the ultimate logarithmic theory is then to include the elegant constructions in  @xcite .",
    "taking the kernel of screenings and identifying the relevant @xmath4-algebra and its irreducible representations is only the first step in constructing ( the chiral sector of ) a logarithmic conformal field theory model because _ extensions _ of these representations must be taken in order to obtain modules where the relevant generators ( e.g. , @xmath611 ) act nonsemisimply .",
    "the extensions are to be taken `` up to the limit , '' which means constructing projective covers of irreducible @xmath4-algebra modules .",
    "the full space of states in a given chiral sector is then the sum of all nonisomorphic indecomposable projective modules .",

    "constructions of some indecomposable @xmath25-modules were given in  @xcite .",
