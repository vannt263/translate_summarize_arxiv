    "finding new populations of faint high - redshift galaxies is an important step to unveil the cosmic star formation history of the universe .",
    "deep mid - infrared ( especially at 15  @xmath0 m ) and far - infrared ( at 90 , 170  @xmath0 m ) surveys with the infrared space observatory ( iso , @xcite , and references therein ) discovered a distinct population with faint optical fluxes and large infrared luminosities ( @xmath9 , @xcite ) at @xmath10 .",

    "not only the source count models for mid - ir counts but also the x - ray data  @xcite and subsequent spectroscopic studies  @xcite confirmed that the bulk of the iso sources were starburst galaxies not the agns .    the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite also offers excellent sensitivities in the four irac wavebands between 3.6 and 8.0  @xmath0 m  @xcite and at mips 24  @xmath0 m  @xcite , and has revealed that the key epoch to understand the formation and evolution of massive ( @xmath11 ) galaxies is at @xmath12 : the star formation activity of massive galaxies at @xmath13 is hundred times larger than that at present  ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". these ultra - luminous ( @xmath14 ) infrared galaxies  ( ulirgs ) may be the progenitors of present - day massive galaxies . in order to reveal their nature , we require complete , uniform samples of massive star forming galaxies at @xmath12 . although the _ spitzer _ 24  @xmath0 m deep surveys can probe galaxies at this redshift range , deep surveys at shorter mid - infrared wavelengths ( 10 - 20  @xmath0 m , in the gap between the irac 8  @xmath0 m band and the mips 24  @xmath0 m band ) are very important to unveil the nature of them , since the strong 6.2 & 7.7  @xmath0 m pah features prominent in the mid infrared spectra of star - forming galaxies can enter the mips 24  @xmath0 m passband only at @xmath15 . _",

    "the irc incorporates three infrared cameras covering nine bands between 2 & 24  @xmath0 m suitable for deep cosmological surveys .",
    "note that due to the nature of the orbit of akari ( sun - synchronous ) , the visibility of any point on the sky is a strong function of ecliptic latitude and thus deep surveys are only possible at the ecliptic poles .",

    "the data for this work were taken using the irc05 astronmoical observation template ( aot ) mode which is optimized for deep survey observations .",
    "note that the irc05 aot minimizes overheads by using the minimum number of resets , no filter change and moreover no dithering operation during the 10 minute integration time for one pointing .",
    "therefore , the dithering is performed among the individual pointing observations to remove the effects of dead / hot pixels and cosmic rays , etc .",
    "the total net exposure time of the ten pointing observations was 4417 seconds .",
    "the data from individual frames for each pointing were reduced using the standard irc data reduction pipeline version 060801 @xcite within the iraf environment .",
    "the irc pipeline splits pointings into individual frames and corrects for instrument characteristics by masking of anomalous / dead pixels , and then applies dark subtraction , linearity correction , saturation , distortion correction and flat fielding , etc .",
    "astrometric data ( world coordinate system , wcs ) is applied by matching bright stars within the data with 2mass counterparts .",
    "identification of bright point sources in the deep optical image  ( @xcite , see section  [ sec : optical ] ) by eye suggests that the positional accuracy of the wcs is much better than two pixels ( 5  arcsec ) .",
    "the resulting stacked images for the individual pointing observations are then co - added by identifying the relatively bright sources in each processed image of one pointing .",
    "finally the edge of the image , where the signal - to - noise ratio is worse , was trimmed , resulting in a final image size of 77.29  arcmin@xmath28 .",
    "we used sextracter  @xcite for the source detection , and source fluxes were evaluated by aperture photometry with a radius of 1.3  arcsec . in total 257 sources were extracted between @xmath29=16 and 20  magnitudes , of which 110 sources were fainter than 19  mag .    at present , the depth of the final l15 image is approximately 42  @xmath0jy in 3@xmath16 , probably due to the fact that the source extraction technique is not yet optimized .",
    "the completeness analysis result implies that the number of sources below 150  @xmath0jy is substantially underestimated , but once detected , the source detection is reliable down to @xmath29=20  mag  ( or 36 @xmath0jy ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is justified since 6080% of the sources fainter than @xmath29=18  mag can be identified in the optical images  ( see section  [ sec : subaru_id ] ) .",
    "approximately one third of the performance verification field is covered by a single subaru suprime - cam field of view ( 916 arcmin@xmath1 ) to @xmath30=28.4 , @xmath31=27 , @xmath32=27.4 , @xmath33=27 , @xmath34=26.2 ( 3@xmath16 , ab magnitude , @xcite , in preparation ) .",

    "the above number is about 10 - 30 % less than the matching probability of 60  80 % for l15 sources in the subaru image .",

    "this result indicates that the fraction of the ulirgs in the faint 15  @xmath0 m sample is much larger than that in the brighter 15  @xmath0 m sample .",
    "based on optical to 15  @xmath0 m sed fitting for a few sources with the @xmath8-band data available so far , we found that several 15  @xmath0 m sources can be explained by an sed of the dusty starburst population ( ulirgs ) .",
    "deep @xmath55 & @xmath8-band data as well as akari mid - infrared multi - band data other than 15  @xmath0 m are essential to further constrain the nature of the faint 15  @xmath0 m population .",

    "<S> we present the results of optical identifications for 257 mid - infrared sources detected with a deep 15  @xmath0 m survey over approximately 80  arcmin@xmath1 area in the akari performance verification field near the north ecliptic pole . </S>",
    "<S> the 15  @xmath0 m fluxes of the sources range from 1  mjy down to 40  @xmath0jy , approximately a half of which are below 100  @xmath0jy . </S>",
    "<S> optical counterparts were searched for within a 2 - 3  arcsec radius in both the @xmath2 catalog generated by using the deep subaru / suprime - cam field which covers one - third of the performance verification field , and the @xmath3 catalog based on observations made with megacam at cfht . </S>",
    "<S> we found @xmath4 and @xmath5 colours of sources with successful optical identifications are systematically redder than that of the entire optical sample in the same field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , approximately 40% of the 15  @xmath0 m sources show colours @xmath6 , which can not be explained by the spectral energy distribution  ( sed ) of normal quiescent spiral galaxies , but are consistent with seds of redshifted ( @xmath7 ) starburst or ultraluminous infrared galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the fraction of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies in our faint 15  @xmath0 m sample is much larger than that in our brighter 15  @xmath0 m sources , which is consistent with the evolving mid - infrared luminosity function derived by recent studies based on the spitzer 24  @xmath0 m deep surveys . </S>",
    "<S> based on an sed fitting technique , the nature of the faint 15  @xmath0 m sources is further discussed for a selected number of sources with available @xmath8-band data . </S>"
