    "physically interesting superconducting loops with junctions are the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) and the superconductor / normal / superconductor loop with long normal sector ( @xmath0 loop ) .",
    "both are mesoscopic size and yield persistent currents when a magnetic flux threads the loop .",
    "the thickness of the josephson junctions in squid loop is much smaller than the superconducting coherence length , but the thickness of normal segment @xmath1 of @xmath0 loop can be larger than that .",
    "the persistent current in the former system flows by tunneling the josephson junction , while that in the latter by the long range proximity effect .",
    "since these two loops are very different in nature , we can anticipate a different current - phase relation for @xmath0 loop , but it was not explicitly demonstrated in previous studies for the superconductor / normal / superconductor hybrid junction @xcite and for the @xmath0 loop @xcite in connection with the andreev reflection process @xcite .",
    "the current described by the motion of a pair of electron and hole in the normal sector changes into that by a cooper pair in the superconducting sector .",
    "there is an intermediate region near the edge of superconductor , where the current is described by quasiparticles and quasiholes.then the current carried by the electrons and the holes in the normal sector should be the same as that carried by quasiparticles and quasiholes in the intermediate region .",
    "this current conservation condition can be satisfied by considering that two wave vectors of the quasiparticle and the quasihole can be different from each other like those of electron and hole in the normal sector . in solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , we consider the average energy of a pair of particles is a dynamic variable rather than a constant chemical potential .",
    "thus the values of the dynamic variables are determined by minimizing the free energy of the @xmath0 loop .",
    "recently an experiment for the high-@xmath2 supercondutor ( hts ) junction with interlayer much thicker than the superconducting correlation length has been reported @xcite , where the hts junction was incorporated in a superconducting loop with threading external magnetic flux @xmath3 . in this single - junction interferometer experiment ,",
    "the current - phase relation shows the highly non - sinusoidal behaviors so that the slope of the current for zero external flux becomes larger than that for @xmath4 with the superconducting unit flux quantum @xmath5 as temperature goes down .",
    "the tunneling currents are supposed to take place through the long range proximity effect across the thick @xmath6 ( pbco ) interlayer .",
    "since the @xmath7 chains in the pbco layer are metallic at low temperature , the above junction can be considered as a @xmath0 junction incorporated in a superconduction loop . in this study",
    "we calculate the persistent current of the above @xmath0 loop considering the current conservation and free energy minimum conditions and show that the experimentally observed non - sinusoidal type current can emerge through the long - range proximity effect in the @xmath0 loop .",
    "the quasiparticles in an sns loop with threading external magnetic flux can be described by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 with the electron mass @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the vector potential with the circumference of loop @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the pair potential as a function of spatial coordinate @xmath14 .    for a superconducting loop _ without _ junction threaded by an aharonov - bohm flux ,",
    "the quasiparticle wave functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 contain extra factor due to gauge invariance such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "uniform flow of persistent current is derived by the bdg equation with the pair potential , @xmath20 @xcite .    if the superconducting loop is interrupted by a normal sector as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] , the wave function @xmath21 of a pair of electron and hole in normal sector @xmath22 and of a pair of quasiparticle and quasihole in the intermediate region of superconducting sector @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the phase shift due to andreev reflection at the ns interface @xcite and , when a pair of quasiparticles passes through the ns interface , each quasiparticle acquires the additional phase equal to @xmath25 .",
    "since we do not make any assumption about the sign of the wave vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , this wave function can describe both the excitations moving clockwise and counterclockwise . here",
    "a notable point is that the wave vectors of the quasiparticle and the quasihole in the previous work @xcite are set to be the same .",
    "it is , however , natural to discriminate the wave vectors like those of particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the normal sector in order to satisfy the current conservation condition .",
    "therefore , we introduce different wave vectors , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for the quasiparticle and the quasihole in the intermediate region of superconducting sector .    this equation can be solved easily for the normal sector in which @xmath30 , and yields the relations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that @xmath33 in the intermediate region of superconducting sector , however , the bdg equation must be solved with the pair potential @xmath34 then the bdg equation for @xmath35 becomes @xmath36 and @xmath37 representing @xmath38 and @xmath39 such as @xmath40 and @xmath41 we get an expression for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for @xmath46 , we can also solve the bdg equation and find that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    the phase matching conditions for the wave function of eq .",

    "the condition for the existence of a solution leads to the boundary condition @xmath57 when an electron becomes andreev - reflected at the superconductor / nomal interface , the transmitted quasiparticle pair obtains the additional phase @xmath58 .",
    "the phase @xmath59 in the boundary condition in eq .",
    "( [ contns ] ) is the sum of two phase changes @xmath58 due to the andreev reflections at each interface .",
    "the condition of current conservation at ns interface will be given by using the representation of the flux @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "in the wave function @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ wfns ] ) , @xmath15 is the electronlike wave function and @xmath16 is the holelike wave function which is the complex conjugate of the electronlike wave function . the current representation for a pair of electrons thus should be obtained with the wave function @xmath62 and we can get the relation @xmath63 the cooper pairs in superconducting sector then should carry the current @xmath64 with the density of cooper pairs @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "when we calculate the current through the @xmath0 junction , we may be able to set the average energy @xmath31 of the particle and the hole in eq .",
    "( [ normalu ] ) equal to the chemical potential .",
    "but , in the @xmath0 loop , @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ normalu ] ) need not be the constant chemical potential .",
    "for example , we consider a simple normal loop with a threading flux .",
    "the average energy of two particles @xmath31 at fermi level is different from the chemical potential @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend on the dynamic variable @xmath25 as well as @xmath69 in the @xmath0 loop , @xmath31 can not be set as a constant chemical potential but should also be a dynamic variable to be determined .    since an extra variable @xmath31 is introduced , we need one more independent relation . that is given by the requirement of free energy minimum @xcite .",
    "since the intermediate region of superconducting sector is so thin that we neglect the energy of this region in the free energy expression and consider only the energy of cooper pairs . in superconducting sector the cooper pairs carry the persistent current corresponding to the cooper pair wave vector @xmath70 and the energy of a cooper pair can be written as @xmath71 with @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the total free energy per particle @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73 using eqs .",
    "( [ normalu ] ) and ( [ u ] ) , the total free energy can be represented in @xmath74 and @xmath75 .      solving the coupled equations ( [ normalu ] ) , ( [ normale ] ) , ( [ u ] ) , ( [ e ] ) , ( [ contns ] ) , ( [ current ] ) and ( [ ce ] )",
    "numerically , we obtain the energy levels corresponding to the two solutions of the bdg equation in eq .",
    "( [ bdg ] ) as a function of external flux @xmath86 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : endiagram](a ) , where the solid and the dashed lines denote the lower levels and the other lines the higher levels .",

    "the persistent currents in fig . [ fig : endiagram](b ) are represented by the same lines as those of the corresponding states in fig .",
    "[ fig : endiagram](a ) . the persistent current , @xmath64 , can be written by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a gap potential chosen arbitrary .",
    "since the cooper pairs in the superconductor are in the coherent condensate state , each cooper pair carries the same superconducting current .",
    "a cooper pair changes into a pair of normal electrons in the normal sector via a pair of quasiparticles in the intermediate region . since the current in the loop should be conserved , the current equal to the macroscopic persistent current in the superconducting sector flows in the normal sector . in fig .",
    "[ fig : endiagram](b ) , we can see several persistent currents , of which the persistent current at ground state corresponds to the solid line for @xmath91 and the dashed line for @xmath92 , the saw - tooth type current .",
    "recently a single - junction interferometer experiment was done on hts junction @xcite ( @xmath93 /@xmath94/@xmath93 ) which is incorporated into a superconducting loop with penetrating magnetic flux .",
    "since there is no misorientation angle between the two d - wave superconductors across the interlayer in this experiment , the phase difference across the interlayer can be brought about only by the threading magnetic flux .",
    "they obtained the current - phase relation at finite temperature , where the slope for zero external flux is larger than that for the external flux @xmath95 .    in this experiment ,",
    "the thickness of the pbco interlayer of the junction is as long as hundreds @xmath96 which is much larger than the high-@xmath2 superconducting correlation length by an order of magnitude and thus the cooper pairs can not directly tunnel the junction .",
    "these long range proximity effects have been observed in many experiments on hts junctions @xcite and considered as a characteristic of @xmath0 junctions .",
    "thus the experimental results may be explained by calculating the currents of the @xmath0 loop as a function of the threading external flux .    here",
    "we can raise a question that whether it is a real proximity effect , i.e. , there are filaments of pinholes or microshots so that the cooper pairs can be transported by the resonant tunneling through localized states in filaments .",
    "recently an experiment on the trilayer hts junction @xcite has been reported , where they synthesized atomically smooth films of hts and uniform trilayer junction so that they conclude that the long - range proximity effect do not originate from the resonant tunneling through the energy - aligned states in the microshots , but it is an intrinsic property of the interlayer .",
    "in fact , the supercurrents are known to flow via metallic @xmath97 chains in the pbco interlayer @xcite .    from the currents in fig .",
    "[ fig : endiagram](b ) corresponding to the states in fig .",
    "[ fig : endiagram](a ) we can obtain the persistent currents of the @xmath0 loop at finite temperatures . at finite temperature , since the current state with energy @xmath98 has the probability proportional to @xmath99 , we can obtain the thermally averaged persistent currents from those current states in fig .",
    "[ fig : endiagram ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcsin ] .",

    "the current takes the sinusoidal form only after the temperature goes up such that @xmath101 which corresponds to the temperature near @xmath2 .",
    "actually the similar behavior can also be seen in the loop interrupted by a grain boundary josephson junction not by an @xmath0 junction , which however comes from the phase difference across the grain boundary josephson junction due to the misorientation angle between two d - wave superconductors @xcite . in @xmath0",
    "junctions the wave functions acquire the andreev reflection phase shift @xmath25 which appears in the boundary condition of eq .",
    "( [ contns ] ) .",
    "the andreev phase shift takes the place of the misorientation angle of the grain boundary josephson junction and thus results in the non - sinusoidal current - phase relation as shown in the manuscript . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors explained their own experimental results by assuming thermal fluctuations which induced the highly non - sinusoidal current - phase relation at low temperatures . at higher temperatures near the critical temperature",
    "they can recover the sinusoidal current - phase relations . in the present study ,",

    "the cooper pairs in the superconducting sector become the electron pairs in the normal sector via the quasiparticle states in the intermediate region .",
    "the net current in the @xmath0 loop should be preserved and thus we introduce different wave vectors of the pair of quasiparticles in order to satisfy the current conservation condition . furthermore , since the average energy of a pair of particles should be a dynamic variable , we also consider the free energy minimum condition .",
