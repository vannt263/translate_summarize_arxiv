    "not long ago , it was taken as physical law that macroscopic systems formed from fermions are fermi liquids , behaving in a scaling sense as the non - interacting fermi gas characterized by the fermi degeneracy scale .",
    "this has changed drastically in recent times by the discovery that in some metals the system of electrons behaves very differently .",
    "clear cut examples are the quantum critical metallic states found at quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion compounds@xcite , while there are indications that the metallic states found in the cuprate high - t@xmath0 superconductors are of a similar kind.@xcite by tuning a zero temperature control parameter ( like pressure , magnetic field , density ) one encounters fermi liquids with different fermi surfaces , and the quantum critical regime is found at the zero temperature phase transition where one metal turns into the other@xcite .",
    "physical properties in this quantum critical regime are controlled by powerlaws , indicating that the system has become scale invariant , in analogy with both thermal phase transitions and the quantum phase transitions in bosonic systems .",
    "albeit rooted in quantum statistics , the fermi energy is a scale and has therefore to vanish in the quantum critical regime .",
    "this is confirmed in a spectacular fashion in the heavy - fermion systems : the mass of the landau quasiparticles in the fermi liquids on both sides of the transition should be inversely proportional to the fermi energy , and this mass is found to diverge to infinity in the quantum critical regime.@xcite    how to think about a fermion liquid without fermi energy ?",
    "the complete lack of success in understanding the above phenomena is caused by a deep and general methodological problem in many - particle quantum physics.@xcite for bosonic problems one can employ the powerful path integral methods of quantum field theory , directly relating e.g. the quantum critical state to the well understood statistical physics of classical phase transitions . for fermionic systems this alley is blocked by the infamous minus - sign problem rendering the path integral non - probabilistic .",
    "in fact the mathematics is as bad as it can be : troyer and wiese@xcite showed recently that the sign problem falls in the mathematical complexity class `` np hard '' , and the clay mathematics institute has put one of its 7 one million dollar prizes on the proof that such problems can not be solved in polynomial time .",
    "some time ago , ceperley@xcite discovered an alternative representation for the fermionic path integral that does not solve the minus - sign problem in a mathematical sense but has as virtue that the fermionic statistics is coded in a more manageable way : the constrained fermionic path integral . in this framework , the minus signs associated with fermi - dirac statistics are self - consistently translated into a geometrical constraint structure ( the nodal hypersurface ) acting on a residual bosonic dynamics .",
    "although this nodal surface which contains all the data associated with the differences between bosonic and fermionic matter is a priori not known for an interacting fermion problem , in the scaling limit only its average and global properties should matter . henceforth , it should be possible in principle to classify all forms of fermionic matter in a phenomenological way by classifying the average geometrical- and topological properties of the constraint structure to subsequently use this data as an input to solve the resulting bosonic path integral problem .",
    "this procedure is supposedly a unique extension of the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm for bosonic matter to fermionic matter . employing the ceperley path integral , in this paper we deliver proof of principle that fermion statistics and emergent scale invariance underlying the critical state can be reconciled .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec.constrained ] we introduce the ceperley path integral and explain the notion of the `` nodal hypersurface '' . as one anticipates , it has to be that the scales of the fermi liquid are encoded in the nodal surface since the residual bosonic dynamics can not possibly generate these scales by itself . in section [ sec.geometry ]",
    "we indeed establish a one - to - one correspondence between the fermi degeneracy scale and an average nodal pocket dimension and demonstrate that in order for a fermionic system to become critical the nodal surface has to turn into a scale invariant fractal .",
    "this should be regarded as our most important result which is further illustrated in the remainder of this paper . in section [ sec.feynman ]",
    "we introduce the concept of feynman and cohen@xcite of incorporating hydrodynamical backflow effects in a quantum mechanical wave function and show that fermionic backflow wave functions describe many - particle states characterized by a hierarchy of increasing number of particle correlations .",
    "the nodal structures of such wave functions are investigated in section [ sec.backflow ] .",
    "we find that their nodal surfaces change drastically with increasing backflow strength and turn into a fractal when the backflow becomes hydrodynamical , involving a macroscopic number of particles .",
    "a detailed fractal analysis is provided in section [ sec.fractal ] . in section [ sec.mass ]",
    "we perform monte - carlo calculations of the momentum distribution to extract the quasiparticle effective mass as a function of backflow strength .",
    "we find that the effective mass diverges exactly at the point where the nodal surface turns into a fractal .",
    "finally , in section [ sec.disc ] our results are summarized and discussed .",
    "the fermion sign problem becomes apparent when expressing the many body density matrix @xmath1 with @xmath2 the position in @xmath3 dimensional configuration space ( @xmath4 the spacial dimension and @xmath5 the number of particles ) , and @xmath6 the inverse temperature , as a path integral over worldlines @xmath7 in imaginary time @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , weighted by an action @xmath10 $ ] ,    @xmath11/\\hbar}\\nonumber\\\\ { \\mathcal{s}}[{{\\bf r}}_\\tau ] & = & \\int_0^{\\hbar\\beta}{\\textrm{d}}\\tau\\left\\{\\frac m2 \\dot{{{\\bf r}}}^2_\\tau+v({{\\bf r}}_\\tau)\\right\\ } , \\label{pi_signful}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the sum over all possible @xmath12 particle permutations @xmath13 accounts for the indistinguishability of the particles and the alternating sign imposes the fermi - dirac statistics . here",
    "@xmath14 denotes the parity of the permutation , even permutations enter with a positive , odd permutations with a negative sign .",
    "the term @xmath15 is a short hand notation for both external potentials and particle interactions . for simplicity",

    "the partition function is obtained as a trace over the diagonal elements of the density matrix , @xmath16 corresponding to worldlines returning to their starting place or a permutation of it . for bosons",
    "where the minus signs are absent the partition function can be viewed as a classical one describing an ensemble of interacting cross - linked ringpolymers .",
    "however , the fermionic minus signs make this probabilistic interpretation impossible .",
    "some time ago , ceperley proved@xcite that the fermionic density matrix can be calculated as a path integral analogous to eq .",
    "( [ pi_signful ] ) but summing only over worldlines that do not cross the nodes of the density matrix itself which define for each given initial point @xmath17 and inverse temperature @xmath18 a @xmath19-dimensional hypersurface in @xmath3-dimensional configuration space ,    @xmath20    those hypersufaces act as infinite potential barriers allowing only for node avoiding worldines @xmath21 with @xmath22 for @xmath23 .    to calculate the partition function we have to integrate over the diagonal density matrix @xmath24 which is obtained as a path integral over all worldline configuration @xmath25 which do not cross the nodal surface on any time slice and belong to the reach    @xmath26    because of the anti - symmetry of the fermionic density matrix under particle permutations @xmath27 ,    @xmath28    all worldline configurations corresponding to odd permutations have to cross a node an odd number of times and are therefore completely removed from the partition function .",

    "surely , one can not negotiate with the np - hardness of the fermion problem and ceperley s path integral is not solving this problem in a mathematical sense .",
    "however , the negative signs are transformed away at the expense of a structure of constraints limiting the boltzmannian sum over worldline configurations .",
    "these constraints in turn can be related to a geometrical manifold embedded in configuration space : the reach , which is determined by the nodal hypersurfaces of the fermion density matrix .",
    "this reach should be computed self - consistently : it is governed by the constrained path integral that needs itself the reach to be computed .",
    "so far , this self consistent reformulation of the path integral has only been used to study fermi liquids like helium-3@xcite and many body hydrogen@xcite quantitatively within path - integral monte - carlo simulations fixing the nodal constraints with a free - particle density matrix . at a first glance , this might seem to be a very crude approximation , however , in a scaling sense the fermi liquid can be viewed as a gas of weakly interacting landau quasiparticles . as we will see in the next section , imposing the nodal constraint structure of non - interacting fermions on the residual bosonic dynamics means nothing but taking landau s fermi - liquid paradigm for granted .    let us further inspect the nodal hypersurface and the workings of the constrained path integral .",
    "since the fermionic density matrix is odd under particle exchanges @xmath30 ,    @xmath31    the density matrix is zero if two fermions are at the same position , @xmath32 , irrespective of the temperature , the reference point @xmath17 , and the interactions between the particles .",
    "therefore , the pauli surface    @xmath33    is always a submanifold of the nodal surface @xmath34 , whereas the dimensionality of the pauli surface is @xmath35 .    in terms of a complete set of fermionic eigenfunctions",

    "( [ freeandtent]a ) a random cut through the nodal hypersurface of the ground - state wavefunction @xmath46 of @xmath47 spinless fermions in a two - dimensional periodic box is shown .",
    "this particular particle number corresponds to a set of momenta @xmath48 on a grid @xmath49 ( @xmath50 the linear dimension of the box ) forming a closed shell in momentum space and therefore to a non - degenerate ground state ( see inset of fig .",
    "( [ freeandtent]a ) ) .",
    "the cut is obtained by fixing @xmath43 particles at random positions and tracking down the nodes of the wave function moving the remaining particle over the system .",
    "the algorithms used to find the nodes of free fermion and feynman backflow wave functions studied later on is described in detail in appendix [ a.nodes ] . since the pauli surface is a lower dimensional submanifold of the nodal surface the fixed @xmath43 particles",

    "we find that the nodes are very smooth forming pockets of the order of the average inter - particle spacing @xmath51 .",
    "an investigation of the nodal structures of the finite - temperature density matrix@xcite shows that this observation holds at any temperature and that the nodal surfaces smoothly approach the ground - state nodes in the limit @xmath40 .",

    "since @xmath55 for all @xmath56 this nodal tent acts as a hardcore boundary for the world line of the particle @xmath52 and the particle is not allowed to penetrate or collide with the tent. a world line configuration as shown in fig .",
    "( [ freeandtent ] ) does not violate the constraints and contributes to the ceperley path integral .",
    "in a recent tutorial paper@xcite the fermion sign problem has been studied within both the conventional signful and the ceperley path integral .",
    "it turns out that even for the free fermi gas for which every student in physics knows the canonical solution , the constrained path integral turns into a highly nontrivial affair .",
    "remarkably , in momentum space the constrained path integral directly leads to a one - to - one correspondence between the fermi gas and a system of classical atoms forming a mott insulating state in the presence of a commensurate optical lattice of infinite strength , living in a harmonic potential trap of finite strength.@xcite this analogy is literal and the only oddity is that we are talking about an optical lattice system in momentum space .",
    "we immediately rediscover our canonical picture of the fermi gas , simply because the dynamics of the world lines becomes trivial due to the conservation of single - particle momentum .",
    "however , the workings of the nodal constraints in the real - space formulation remain to a great extend puzzling.@xcite    let us start with the case of free fermions in one space dimension , where the physics of quantum matter can be regarded as completely understood.@xcite the deep reason is that quantum statistics has no physical meaning in 1 + 1d , and it is always possible to find a representation where the sign structure drops out completely .",
    "it is instructive to find out how this is processed by the ceperley path integral .",
    "the special status of the one - dimensional case becomes immediately clear since the dimensions of the pauli surface and the nodal hypersurface coincide and the two manifold become the same .",
    "in this situation it becomes quite easy to read the reach .",
    "start out with a reference point @xmath57 ordering the particles for instance like @xmath58 .",
    "spread out this configuration in terms of world lines meandering along the imaginary time direction and the pauli - hypersurface reach tells that only configurations are allowed where these world lines never cross each other at any imaginary time .",
    "therefore , the ordering of the particles is preserved on all times and we only have to consider world - line configurations where every particle returns to its starting position .",
    "the particles become effectively distinguishable . a more abstract way of saying this is that the pauli surface ( = nodal surface ) divides the @xmath5-dimensional configuration space into @xmath12 disconnected nodal cells , each corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles .",
    "we have seen that the ceperley path integral for the one - dimensional fermi gas is equivalent to the one for hard - core bosons in 1 + 1 dimensions or from a statistical physics point of view to the problem of an ensemble of polymers with only steric , hard - core interactions in 2 dimensions .",
    "this pokrovsky - talapov problem@xcite is surely a very serious statistical physics problem since the constraints correspond with infinitely strong delta function interactions and accordingly everything is about entropic interactions and order - out - of - disorder physics .",
    "remarkably , the one dimensional fermion story can be completely understood from this radically statistical physics viewpoint@xcite by using a self - consistent phonon method discovered by helfrich@xcite to deal with the entropic interactions associated with biological ( extrinsic curvature ) membranes .",
    "obviously , in @xmath59 where the pauli surface is a lower dimensional submanifold of the nodal hypersurface the self - consistency problem inherent to the constrained path integral can not be resolved like in the one - dimensional case .",
    "this is the reason why a general bosonization procedure is lacking in higher dimensions . although the ceperley path integral has a much richer structure in higher dimensions it is surely the case that the higher dimensional fermi liquids have to know about the entropic dynamics characteristic for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case .",
    "however , a generalization of the helfrich construction to deal with the steric interactions with nodal tent in a self - consistent way is lacking .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the one - dimensional case , in @xmath59 world line configurations corresponding to even permutations are a - priori not ruled out by the constraint structure .",
    "recently , mitas demonstrated@xcite that in the case of free spinless fermions the nodal surface has a minimal tiling property : it divides the configuration space into two nodal cells only .",
    "therefore , it is alway possible to find a continuous path @xmath60 not encountering a node . in other words ,",
    "all even permutations are on the reach @xmath61 and contribute to the constrained path integral .",
    "phenomenologically the ceperley path integral can be viewed as a bosonic dynamics subject to a geometrical constraint structure and therefore as a statistical physics problem .",
    "however , it is a highly non trivial question how to reconstruct the free @xmath4-dimensional fermi gas within this framework using the real space representation ( [ constpath ] ) and only the one - dimensional case can be regarded as fully understood.@xcite from the canonical picture we know that the fermi gas is characterized by a sharp fermi surface at zero temperature and that the thermodynamics at low temperatures is governed by particle - hole excitations in the vicinity of the fermi surface leading for instance to a linear specific heat @xmath62 for @xmath63 , irrespective of the spatial dimension .",
    "this is surely unconventional for a system of interacting bosons where the spatial dimension enters the exponents of low - temperature expansions in a natural way .",
    "recently , it was conjectured@xcite that the nodal surface constraints act in a highly nonlocal way leading to an effective reduction of the dimensionality in a way that the systems behave qualitatively like soft - core bosons in 1 + 1d !",
    "such a holographic principle would also explain why the nodal - surface constraints prevent the system from undergoing a bose condensation at finite temperatures and might relate the emergence of a sharp fermi surface with a condensation exactly at @xmath64 .",
    "the constrained path integral is a precise reformulation of the sign - full path - integral in terms of an effective bosonic dynamics subject to a geometrical constraint structure and therefore leads the way to a probabilistic , statistical physics interpretation of fermionic systems since the sign structure is absorbed in the nodal hypersurface .",
    "a fermionic state like the fermi liquid is characterized by scales , the fermi - energy @xmath65 and momentum @xmath66 .",
    "these scales are alien to any bosonic system .",
    "it has to be that these scales are uniquely encoded in the nodal structure , since the residual bosonic system can not possibly generate these scales by itself .    in the previous section",
    ", we have seen that in dimensions @xmath59 the pauli surface is a lower dimensional sub- manifold of the nodal hypersurface , irrespective of temperature or the form of interactions . for free fermions",
    "we find the nodal surface to smoothly connect the lower dimensional pauli surface both at zero temperature ( see fig .",
    "( [ freeandtent]a ) ) and in the finite temperature case.@xcite therefore , the corresponding nodal structure is characterized by a scale , an average nodal spacing of the order of the average inter - particle spacing @xmath51 .",
    "this is clearly seen in the two - dimensional nodal surface cut shown in fig .",
    "( [ freeandtent]a ) : moving one particular particle over the two - dimensional box we find nodal lines smoothly connecting the @xmath43 other particles , forming pockets with a linear dimension of the order of @xmath51 .",
    "the presence of this scale in the nodal surface can be also deduced by a different argument.@xcite from the reduced one body density matrix which is simply the fourier transform of the single - particle momentum distribution , @xmath67 , given in the limit @xmath40 by    @xmath68    one obtains an estimate for the nodal spacing .",
    "the zeros of @xmath69 correspond to the average displacement of a particle to be found on a node . for the fermi gas the momentum distribution in the limit",
    "@xmath70 simply turns into a step function @xmath71 with @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath72 for @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to the fourier transform    @xmath75    where @xmath76 denotes a constant depending on the spatial dimension and @xmath77 a bessel function of the first kind .",
    "asymptotically ,    @xmath78    signaling a long - range periodicity in the nodal structure with an average nodal spacing @xmath79 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is also generic for the fermi liquid characterized by a discontinuity in @xmath80 at the fermi wave - vector @xmath66 .    from the constrained path integral",
    "a one - to - one correspondence between the existence of a scale in the nodal hypersurface and the fermi energy @xmath65 can be established by a simple scaling argument .",
    "let us first assume that the nodal hypersurface is characterized by an average nodal pocket dimension of the order of the inter - particle spacing @xmath51 characteristic for the fermi liquid .",
    "an allowed world line configuration is sketched in fig .",
    "( [ freeandtent]b ) where we follow the time evolution of the nodal constraint structure seen by one particular particle . in the ceperley path",
    "integral the world - line configurations @xmath21 are constrained by the reach determined by the condition that the world lines are not allowed to cross the nodal hypersurface of the density matrix itself at any time .",
    "from the perspective of one particular particle this means that the particle has to stay in its nodal pocket at all times @xmath81 . due to the meanderings of the world lines of the other particles the nodal structure seen by",
    "the particle fluctuates in time leading in a time continuum limit to the picture of a nodal surface tent which hangs in space - time and acts as a hard - core boundary for the particle .",
    "since the pauli surface is at all times a lower dimensional submanifold of the nodal hypersurface the world lines of the other particles act as twisted tent - sticks on which the tent is hanging .",
    "every particle has to stay within the nodal tent which is governed by the dynamics of the other particles . at a timescale @xmath82 when the average square displacement    @xmath83 ^ 2\\rangle = 2d\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\tau\\ ] ]    of the worldlines becomes of the order of the average nodal spacing , @xmath84 ,",
    "the particles start to collide with the nodal tent .",
    "this leads to an average collision time @xmath85 corresponding to an energy scale    @xmath86    where in the last step we have used that the nodal spacing @xmath87 is of the order of the inter - particle spacing @xmath51 , @xmath88 and introduced the particle density @xmath89 with @xmath90 the volume of the @xmath4-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "we recognize immediately that eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) is just the expression for the fermi energy in @xmath4 dimensions , @xmath91 . in the case of free fermions",
    "we can even be more quantitative and estimate the average nodal pocket dimension @xmath87 as the first zero of the reduced one - body density matrix @xmath69 ( [ nrfree ] ) which in @xmath4 dimensions is given by @xmath92 with @xmath93 the first zero of the bessel function @xmath94 .",
    "this yields @xmath95 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 in two and three dimensions , respectively .    from the above scaling argument",
    "we have learned that an average nodal pocket dimension is dynamically related to a typical timescale @xmath82 on which the particles feel the steric constraints imposed by the nodal surface tent. the fermi energy we rediscover immediately as the corresponding energy scale @xmath98 .",
    "what does this imply for a critical fermionic state having no knowledge whatsoever about @xmath65 as required by the underlying scale invariance and as observed in various experiments ? turning the above scaling argument around , the absence of a fermi degeneracy scale immediately implies that the nodal surface can not possibly carry a characteristic scale .",
    "the nodal surface constraints have to act in the same way on all time and length scales and therefore , the nodal surface of any fermionic critical state has to be a scale invariant fractal .",
    "hence , by using scaling arguments resting on the constrained path - integral , we have discovered a phenomenological principle : _ the collapse of the fermi liquid at a quantum critical point as observed experimentally for instance in the heavy fermion metals is necessarily associated with a qualitative change of the nodal surface from a smooth to a fractal geometry .",
    "_ this should be regarded as the most important finding reported in this paper since it identifies the probabilistic constrained path integral as the mathematical framework to reconcile the workings of fermi - dirac statistics and scale invariance .",
    "in the previous section we have convinced ourselves that a critical fermionic state is necessarily characterized by an underlying fractal nodal surface . however , an inherent difficulty of the present approach is that in order to study nodal structures associated with non - conventional states a wave - function ansatz is required .",
    "let us focus on a concept introduced by feynman and cohen incorporating hydrodynamical backflow effects in a quantum mechanical wave - function.@xcite    they argued that the roton in @xmath99he is like a single mobile atom which is however dressed up by collective motions in the liquid .",
    "helium is a nearly incompressible fluid in the hydrodynamical sense and the density in the neighborhood of the moving particle should be barely altered . as a consequence there has to be a backflow of other particles conserving the total current and leading to an enhancement of the effective mass of this quasiparticle which can be described quantum mechanically by taking a plane - wave wavefunction @xmath100 with a collective quasiparticle",
    "coordinate    @xmath101    where @xmath102 are the coordinates of the bare particles , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 a smoothly varying function falling off like @xmath105 on large distances corresponding to hydrodynamical , dipolar backflow of an incompressible fluid in two dimensions .",
    "much later , it was found out that by using fermionic backflow wave functions of the form @xmath106 for node fixing one obtains excellent variational energies for the fermionic @xmath107he quantum fluid@xcite and the homogeneous electron gas.@xcite    it easy to check that such slater determinants of plane - wave functions of collective backflow coordinates are indeed obeying fermi - dirac statistics since the permutation of two particles @xmath102 , @xmath108 leads to an interchange of the collective coordinates @xmath109 and @xmath110 without changing the other collective coordinates and therefore to an overall sign change of the determinant .",
    "therefore , as for any fermionic state the lower dimensional pauli surface is still a submanifold of the nodal hypersurface of fermionic backflow wavefunctions .",
    "however , due to the collectiveness build into these wave functions one might expect the nodal hypersurfaces to be radically different from the smooth free fermion case .",
    "this is supported by earlier work@xcite reporting a precursor of a roughening of the nodal structure in the regime of weak backflow .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the hydrodynamical feynman backflow build into the fermionic wave functions has nothing to do with the conventional notion of backflow in a fermi liquid since it involves interactions between a macroscopic number of particles at the same time . to rationalize this",
    "we will derive an expansion of the hamiltonian of which the backflow wave functions are eigenstates . in terms of collective backflow coordinates ( [ bfc ] )",
    "we are simply dealing with a gas of free quasiparticles and the exact hamiltonian of the system is therefore given by    @xmath111    where we have introduced operators @xmath112 , @xmath113 creating and annihilating a backflow particle with momentum @xmath114 , respectively . to find the representation of this hamiltonian in terms of bare - particle operators @xmath115 , @xmath116 let us first derive an expansion of the @xmath5-particle backflow wave function in terms of free - particle states . using the above fermi operators for backflow and bare particles a general relation",
    "can be written as    @xmath117    where the function @xmath118 is defined as the fourier transform    @xmath119    and for abbreviation we have defined @xmath120 .",
    "the general expressions ( [ exp],[ft ] ) can be further evaluated by expanding the exponentials , @xmath121 which leads to an expansion of the operator @xmath122 which transforms the free fermion state to the backflow state ,    @xmath123    up to second order in the backflow function @xmath104 we obtain    @xmath124    where we have introduced the fourier transform    @xmath125    the hamiltonian transforms under the inverse of the operator @xmath122 , namely    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the hamiltonian for the non - interacting fermi gas . to zeroth order ( no backflow ) we trivially obtain @xmath128 and therefore @xmath129 .",
    "the next corrections to the hamiltonian in first and second order of the backflow function @xmath104 are given by    @xmath130    from the above expansion it becomes immediately clear that feynman backflow generates a hierarchy of processes involving an increasing number of particles .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath131 , the backflow state is of course trivially identical to the free fermion one , @xmath132 . whereas the first order terms @xmath133 are solely corresponding to pair scattering processes to second order @xmath134 the hamiltonian already contains 3- and 4-body interactions .",
    "the expansion in powers of @xmath104 is under control only if the the strength of the backflow is sufficiently weak . in this case",
    "backflow can be to a good approximation rationalized in terms of two - body interactions .",
    "however , when the backflow becomes strong the expansion breaks down and @xmath135-body interactions of arbitrary order are no longer negligible .",
    "surely , such a state characterized by hydrodynamical backflow in a true sense involving a macroscopic number of particles can not be obtained perturbatively since it requires an infinite number of vertex corrections .",
    "anticipating that we will find a critical non - fermi liquid state when the backflow turns hydrodynamical , it might well be that this gives a way a general wisdom .",

    "naively , one expects that a fractal nodal surface imposing constraints on the dynamics on all length and time scales would lead to a drastic enhancement of pairing which might be the reason why quite generically instabilities towards superconducting order in the vicinity of fermionic quantum critical points have been observed .",

    "in fact , the physics associated with backflow is quite similar to the interpretation given by anderson of the strange metal as a gutzwiller projected fermion systems,@xcite in the sense that both approaches are based on a hidden quasiparticle picture and involve singular transformations of the fermi liquid state .",
