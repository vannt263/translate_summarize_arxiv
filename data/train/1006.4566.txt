    "in other words , how much information about a closed curve of finite length in euclidean space is encoded in the relative tangent - point data ?",
    "the answer is : if the astronauts obtain a finite integral mean of some inverse power of all these data ( after time @xmath21 ) they can extract essential topological information as well as explicit smoothness properties of their path of travel !    to make this precise we assume from now on that the path @xmath22 is a rectifiable curve of finite length , parametrized by arclength on the circle @xmath23 of perimeter @xmath24 .",

    "mathematically , one can easily reparametrize the manifold to obtain a new injective arclength parametrization , which translates to the additional information that the spacecraft does not pass by any previous position at all , @xmath45 for all @xmath46 which we will assume from now on .    in light of theorem [ thm:1.1 ]",

    "essentially one reduces the isotopy question to that between polygons inscribed in @xmath57 and @xmath52 , whose edge lengths are solely controlled in terms of the energy . for polygonal knots a similar result is contained in the work of millet , piatek , and rawdon ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is relatively easy to use scaling arguments and check that @xmath74 for each @xmath5 when @xmath15 parametrizes a closed polygonal curve , but polygons have finite energy for all @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting hlder exponent @xmath76 is reminiscent of the classic sobolev imbedding theorem in the supercritical case : the domain of integration is two - dimensional , and the integrand is related to curvature . for @xmath77-curves the behaviour of @xmath78 close to the diagonal of @xmath79 ( where @xmath78 might blow up for curves with low regularity ) encodes some information about curvature , i.e. about second derivatives of the arclength parametrization @xmath15 .",
    "the point is that we need no information about the existence of @xmath80 in order to prove theorem  [ thm:1.3 ] .",
    "a priori , we deal with curves that are rectifiable only , and even the existence of @xmath81 at all parameters can not be taken for granted .",
    "note that inequality is qualitatively optimal : for curves of class @xmath82 the integrand @xmath78 is bounded , and yields then @xmath83 .    before describing the main ideas of the proof and the structure of the paper we would like to mention that",
    "while working on generalizations of self - avoidance energies to surfaces in @xmath84 , see @xcite , which involved a search for suitable integrands , we have realized that @xmath0 is a model energy that might be the easiest one to extend to the fully general case , i.e. to submanifolds of arbitrary dimension and co - dimension @xcite .",
    "this was one of the motivations to write the present note : to lay out in a simple , relatively easily tractable case all the arguments that should be applicable in much greater generality .",
    "theorem  [ thm:1.1 ] is obtained as a corollary of a slightly more general result , see theorem  [ beta - mfd ] below .",

    "<S> we study a two - point self - avoidance energy @xmath0 which is defined for all rectifiable curves in @xmath1 as the double integral along the curve of @xmath2 . here </S>",

    "<S> it turns out that finiteness of @xmath4 for @xmath5 guarantees that @xmath6 has no self - intersections or triple junctions and therefore must be homeomorphic to the unit circle @xmath7 or to a closed interval @xmath8 . for @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath0 evaluated on curves in @xmath10 turns out to be a knot energy separating different knot types by infinite energy barriers and bounding the number of knot types below a given energy value . </S>",
    "<S> we also establish an explicit upper bound on the hausdorff - distance of two curves in @xmath10 with finite @xmath0-energy that guarantees that these curves are ambient isotopic . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , for all @xmath11 that are larger than the critical exponent @xmath12 , the arclength parametrization of @xmath6 is of class @xmath13 , with hlder norm of the unit tangent depending only on @xmath11 , the length of @xmath6 , and the local energy . </S>",
