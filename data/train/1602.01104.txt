    "@xmath0 is the esa cornerstone astrometry mission building on the heritage of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is an unbiased all - sky ( @xmath540,000 deg@xmath6 ) survey that will enable science with one billion sources by providing @xmath2as accuracy astrometry ( parallaxes , positions and proper motions ) and milli - mag optical spectrophotometry ( luminosities and astrophysical parameters ) for sources down to a limiting magnitude @xmath7 = 20.7 mag , as well as spectroscopy ( radial velocities and chemistry ) for objects brighter than @xmath8 = 15.3 - 16.2 mag ( and @xmath9 2  mag ) .",
    "key - science topics that @xmath0 will address range from : the study of the milky way ( mw ) structure and dynamics to the galaxy star formation history ( e.g. @xcite , for a similar study based on @xmath4 data ) , stellar astrophysics to binaries and multiple stars , brown dwarfs and planetary systems to solar system objects , galaxies to quasars and the reference frame , and fundamental physics to general relativity .",
    "the backbones of @xmath0 s science are also i ) the discovery of thousands new variable sources thanks to repeatedly monitoring the whole celestial sphere and , most importantly , ii ) the absolute calibration of fundamental standard candles of the cosmic distance ladder such as hundreds / thousands of rr  lyrae stars and cepheids that will have their parallax ( hence distance ) measured by @xmath0 at @xmath10  @xmath2as accuracy .",
    "a better knowledge of the cosmic distance ladder has a profound impact in areas ranging from stellar astrophysics to the cosmological model . with the successful launch of @xmath0 and the release of first astrometric data scheduled for mid-2016 ,",
    "this topic has now become extremely hot and timely .",
    "@xmath0 scans the sky from a lissajous - type orbit around the l2 lagrangian point of the sun and earth - moon system , where the spacecraft will remain for its 5-year nominal lifetime and possibly for an additional year , if the mission is extended .",
    "the spacecraft features two primary mirrors mounted on a silicon carbide toroidal optical bench , each with 1.7@xmath11 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the two mirrors are separated by a basic angle of 106.5@xmath12 and share a combined focal plane where there are 106 assembled ccds devoted to different functions : 2 wave - front sensor and 2 basic - angle monitor ccds ; 14 sky mapper ccds with task of detecting sources entering into @xmath0 s two fields of view ; 62 astrometric field ccds devoted to astrometric measurements and providing integrated white - light ( @xmath8-band ) photometry over the wavelength range : 330 - 1,050 nm ; 7 blue and 7 red photometer ( bp and rp ) ccds providing low resolution ( @xmath1320 - 90 ) spectrophotometry for each source over the wavelength ranges 320 - 660 and 650 - 1,000 nm , respectively ; and 12 ccds for the radial velocity spectrograph ( rvs ) obtaining @xmath14 spectra in the ca triplet ( 845 - 872 nm ) region for sources brighter than @xmath1515.3 - 16.2 mag ( and @xmath9 2 mag ) .",
    "a more detailed description of @xmath0 s payload , instruments and focal plane can be found in @xcite and at http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/spacecraft-instruments .    the way @xmath0 scans the sky is due to the spacecraft spinning in 6 hours around its axis , which points in a direction 45@xmath12 away from the sun , and to the spin axis precessing slowly on the sky ( precession period of 63 days and 29 revolutions around solar direction in 5 years ) . as a result of the precession ,",
    "the sky seen by the two fields of view every 6 hours changes slowly with time , allowing repeated full sky coverage over the mission lifetime . at the same time , due to the 106.5@xmath12 separation between the two fields of view , objects transiting fov@xmath16 at time @xmath17 will then transit fov@xmath18 at @xmath19 + 106.5 minutes .",
    "this will then repeat 6 hours later and then again 10 - 30 days later .",
    "these figures give rise to an optimum nominal scanning law by which over the 5 years @xmath0 will observe each source from 10 to 250 times ( the actual number depending on sky position , with maximum frequency at @xmath20@xmath21@xmath20 = 45@xmath22 ) and on average about 70 times in photometry and about 40 times with the rvs .",
    "the sky coverage of @xmath0 after 5 years is shown in fig .  4 of @xcite .",
    "further details on @xmath0 s scanning law can be found at http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/scanning-law .",
    "the scanning law determines the typical cadence of @xmath0 multi - epoch observations and , in turn , bears on the alias patterns we may expect to show up in the power spectrum of @xmath0 time - series data .",
    "@xmath0 does not send images down to ground .",
    "figure  [ img : fig1 ] shows a star density map of the sky observed by the spacecraft produced by visualizing the number of stars between @xmath23 and 18 mag detected per second by @xmath0 s fields of view .",
    "these stars represent only a very small fraction of all detected stars and are used by the attitude control system of @xmath0 to ensure the spacecraft s orientation is maintained with the desired precision .",

    "after a few months of commissioning , @xmath0 entered into nominal science operations on july 18 , 2014 .",
    "the routine phase started with 28 days in epsl , after which the spacecraft went into nominal scanning law ( nsl ) .",
    "@xmath0 s epsl footprint around the south ecliptic pole ( sep ) intercepts a portion of the lmc containing a large number of rr  lyrae and cepheids which were monitored repeatedly during these first days of science operations .",

    "@xmath0 data processing is handled by the data processing and analysis consortium ( dpac ) , an ensemble of approximately 450 scientists and software developers from 20 different ( primarily european ) countries , organized in 6 data processing centers and 9 scientific coordination units , each having its own specific tasks .",
    "dpac processing takes place in a cyclic way and with continuous interaction and exchange among different cus and @xmath0 s main data base which resides at the european space astronomy centre ( esac ) ( see http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-processing ) .",
    "processing of the variable sources observed by @xmath0 is the task of coordination unit 7 ( cu7 ) whose main data processing center is at isdc in geneva .",

    "@xcite predict @xmath0 to observe about 70,000 rr  lyrae stars in the galactic halo ( based on estimates of the rr  lyrae density in the mw halo by @xcite ) and an additional 15,000 - 40,000 rr  lyrae in the mw bulge ( based on macho and ogle detection rates available at the time ) .",
    "however , these might be underestimates , as current ongoing surveys such as ogle , linear , catalina , panstarrs , ptf , are constantly reporting new discoveries and increased rr  lyrae densities . in conclusion",
    ", likely @xmath0 will significantly revise upward the census of galactic rr  lyrae stars both in the mw and in some of its close companions .",
    "over a hundred thousand galactic rr  lyrae are expected to be observe by @xmath0 , but compared to @xmath4 , only 186 such variables were observed , of which only rr  lyrae itself has an accurate enough parallax ( @xmath3018% ) .",

    "all rr  lyrae brighter than @xmath3312 - 13  mag will have their parallax measured by @xmath0 to @xmath10  @xmath2as , whereas individual accuracies will range between 17 to 140 @xmath2as for rr  lyrae stars in galactic globular clusters with horizontal branch luminosity between @xmath3414 and 18 mag .",

    "@xmath0 will provide individual distances from parallaxes measured to @xmath10  @xmath2as for all rr  lyrae brighter than @xmath34 12 mag ( see table  1 in @xcite ) and rvs metallicity for those brighter than @xmath51 16 mag . hence , in a few years from now @xmath10  @xmath2as accuracy parallaxes will become available for 100 - 150 galactic rr  lyrae spanning a large enough metallicity range to measure both the zero point and slope of the @xmath43[fe / h ] and @xmath44 relations directly from these parallax - calibrated sources .",
    "accuracies quoted in @xcite are end - of - mission estimates .",
    "however , parallaxes with sub - milliarcsecond accuracy for rr  lyrae brighter than @xmath52 12 mag may already be included in the tgas catalogue published with @xmath0 s first data release in 2016 .    in summary ,",
    "the unprecedented precision and accuracy of @xmath0 parallax for the local rr  lyrae ( and cepheids ) with allow ( i ) the absolute calibration via parallaxes of these  primary \" standard candles , ( ii ) a test of the metallicity effects through simultaneous abundance measurements , ( iii ) a re - calibration of the  secondary \" distance indicators and ( iv ) to set up a homogeneous distance ladder in and beyond the local group , and finally producing a total re - assessment of the whole cosmic distance ladder .",
    "this will in turn significantly improve our knowledge of the hubble constant ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "furthermore , by combining @xmath0 s photometry , parallax , metallicity and radial velocity information it will be possible to better constrain the physical parameters of rr  lyrae stars , test the pulsation models and their input physics , better determine , for instance , the @xmath54-factor used to convert radial to pulsation velocity in baade - wesselink studies , better understand double - mode pulsation and the blazhko effect and many more other phenomena occurring in rr  lyrae stars .",
    "this will further improve their use as standard candles and stellar population tracers .",
    "finally , synergy between @xmath0 and past , ongoing and future surveys covering the full wavelength range from near - uv to the mid - ir , such as ogle , eros , linear , catalina , ptf , asas , panstarrs , lsst , 2mass , vvv , vmc from the ground , and crrp , smhash , cchpii from space , along with use of upcoming multiplex facilities such as weave , moons , 4most to complement the rvs spectroscopy , will allow a further quantum leap in the science achievable with rr  lyrae stars in the @xmath0 era .",
