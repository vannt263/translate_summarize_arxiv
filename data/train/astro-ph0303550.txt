    "accurate determination of absolute dimensions of eclipsing binaries based , among others , on detailed light curve analysis is still a very important task of modern astronomy .",
    "it gives an opportunity for testing advanced evolutionary models of stars ( e.g.  pols et al .",
    "1997 ) but also allows for very precise distance determination .",
    "the method , at least in principle , is quite straightforward ( see  paczyski 1997 for an outline and clausen  2000 for a review ) .",
    "three distance determination for eclipsing binaries in the large magellanic cloud were quite recently presented : hv 2274 ( guinan et al .",
    "1998 ) , hv 982 ( fitzpatrick et al .  2001 ) and eros 1044 ( ribas et al .  2002 ) giving the distance modulus @xmath5 .",
    "light curve solutions together with estimation of physical parameters and the distance to the small magellanic cloud were obtained also for two eclipsing binaries : hv 2226 ( bell et al .",
    "1991 ) and hv 1620 ( pritchard et al .",
    "1998 ) giving for the distance modulus @xmath6 .",
    "very recently ten eclipsing binaries have been analysed in the central part of the smc giving mean distance modulus @xmath7 ( harries , hilditch & howarth 2003 ) .",
    "the light curve analysis in their paper was based on dophot ogle photometry ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in recent years",
    ", extensive ccd photometry have been undertaken during the projects of microlensing searching toward the magellanic clouds and galactic bulge . as a byproduct , thousands of eclipsing binaries were discovered and placed in catalogs ( grison et al .",
    "1995 , alcock et al .",
    "1997 , udalski et al .",
    "preliminary solutions for macho lmc catalog were found by alcock et al .",
    "they fitted 611 light curves of eclipsing binaries using the ebop code ( etzel 1993 ) . that code uses a tri - axial ellipsoid approximation what makes this code very fast .",
    "but the code can not properly account for the proximity effects present in most of the eclipsing binaries detected by macho . for smc",
    "eclipsing binaries ogle collaboration ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ) extracted from their catalog a sample of 153 detached binaries with well defined , narrow eclipses of similar depth and relatively good photometry .",
    "it was argued that the sample contains the best systems for distance determination .",
    "wyithe & wilson ( 2001 , 2002  hereafter ww1 ,",
    "ww2 ) presented an excellent analysis of the whole ogle data containing 1459 eclipsing binaries using an automated version of the wilson - devinney ( 1971 , wilson 1992 ) code .",
    "this program can provide very detailed treatment of proximity effects .",
    "they used public domain dophot photometry available at ogle homepage _ http://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/var@xmath8stars/smc/ecl _ in the analysis .",
    "they extracted in an objective way two subsets of detached binaries with very narrow eclipses and complete eclipses as the most likely good distance indicators .",
    "subset of semi - detached eclipsing binaries was also chosen as distance indicators on the basis of similar surface brightness between components and complete eclipses .",
    "the authors intend , also , to extract such subsets for contact binaries . in general",
    "it is believed that the close - to - ideal system chosen as a distance indicator , should have two stars of similar temperature and luminosity and the separation of the components should be significantly larger than their radii .",
    "but well - detached , eccentric systems may suffer from the aliasing of photometric solutions .",
    "ww2 argued that semi - detached and contact binaries , and also detached eclipsing binaries showing larger proximity effects , have their photometric solutions better defined and may serve as potential best distance indicators as in the case of recently analyzed 15-th magnitude binary eros 1044 ( ribas et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this paper",
    "i focused my attention only on detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "the release of new dia photometry by ogle collaboration motivated me to reanalyse the light curves of eclipsing binaries in smc for the purpose of extracting a sample of the best distance indicators .",
    "this sample was chosen using additional important criteria which were not used in the selections made by wyithe & wilson .",
    "the analysis was restricted only for bright systems .",
    "it is obvious that those systems have , in general , the largest probability of obtaining high - quality light curves and radial velocity curves .",
    "thus the searching for distance indicators should start from the analysis of the brightest candidates . moreover using dia photometry",
    "we can achieve more realistic determination of the light curve parameters than in the case of using the older dophot photometry .",
    "ccd differential photometric observations of smc eclipsing binaries were obtained by ogle between 1997 and 2000 .",
    "the data were acquired using 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the photometric @xmath0 indices were calculated using the technique of difference image analysis ( dia ) as was reported in zebru , soszyski & woniak ( 2001a ) .",
    "the new photometry was quite recently facilitated on ogle homepage _ http://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle/ogle2/dia _ ( zebru et al .",
    "the ogle database contains all variables detected in the lmc and smc ( 68 thousand ) during the course of the ogle - ii project .",
    "the dia is argued as a superior method over classical dophot method because of its better accuracy , especially in crowded fields ( zebru et al .",
    "the light curves based on ogle - dia photometry are characterized by considerably smaller scatter of observations and higher smoothness of the light curves . also , in most cases the phase coverage is better because the dia photometry includes ogle observations which have extended almost two years after the moment when original catalog of smc eclipsing binaries ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ) was published .",
    "the quality of ogle - dia photometry can be demonstrated by a comparison of the @xmath0 light curves obtained with both methods . as an example i present a 17-th magnitude eccentric eclipsing binary smc sc1 25589  fig .",
    "[ fig:25589 ]  together with preliminary light curve solutions .",
    "note that according to the analysis of dia light curve the system has apparently total eclipses and much larger separation between components than in the case of the analysis of dophot data .",
    "the candidates for the analysis were chosen after the visual inspection of the light curves of eclipsing binaries in smc released by udalski et al .",
    "a preliminary set of about 25 binaries were selected brighter than @xmath9 mag at maximum brightness and with the depth of the primary and secondary eclipses greater than 0.25 mag .",
    "the candidates fall into three separate groups .",
    "the first group , hereafter called a , consist of well - detached , eccentric systems with , usually , deep narrow eclipses .",
    "the second group , hereafter called b , comprise the short - period systems with apparently circular orbits and the small separation between components . as a result ,",
    "the systems from group b show quite large proximity effects in their light curves .",
    "the third group c comprises well separated long period systems with circular orbits . as we expect long period systems to be , in general , eccentric",
    "this is most probably a chance selection .",

    "below the discussion of individual eclipsing binaries as distance indicators to smc is presented .",
    "six candidates were chosen according to the following criteria : the presence of complete eclipses , small residuals , small and well determined third light contribution and the spectral type .",

    "these two binaries may serve as the best candidates because of the presence of complete eclipses , high brightness ( especially sc9 175336 ) , modest proximity effects allowing for reasonable determination of the third light contribution to the system and at last , small residuals . in both cases",
    "the primary is slightly cooler and considerably larger than the secondary component . as a result",
    "there is a quite high luminosity ratio between components @xmath146 ( see table  [ tab : sola ] ) which may by regarded as the only disadvantage of using these systems .",

    "both stars were not included by ww1 or ww2 as likely distance indicators .",
    "very high eccentricity and clear proximity effects visible near the periastron passage are features of both systems .",

    "sc6 67221  during the primary eclipse ( phase 1.0 ) the cooler and probably larger component is eclipsed and the strong mutual reflection causes the brightening of the system visible as a hump around phase 1.0 .",
    "both systems may serve as ideal testers of mutual reflection treatment used in modern light curve synthesis programs .",
    "indeed , the presence of small residuals visible near phase 1.1 in sc5 129441 and near the primary eclipse in sc6 67221 may ( fig .  [ fig : fita ] ) suggest that simple reflection used in the analysis ( see  3.1 ) might be too crude a simplification",
    ". unfortunately the use of the detailed reflection ( which should be more appropriate for these binaries ) together with the eccentric orbits makes wd program practically unsuitable for analysis due to an enormously large computational time ( wilson 1992 ) .",
    "both systems show no substantial third light contribution .",
    "the expected velocity semiamplitudes should be @xmath151 km / s for sc5 129441 and @xmath152 km / s and @xmath153 km / s for sc6 67221 .",
    "sc5 129441 was suggested by ww1 to have complete eclipses , but the present light curve analysis did not support this thesis .",
    "sc6 67221 was not included by ww1 .",
    "this binary seems to be the most massive and the most luminous in the sample ( beside sc9 163575 ) , consisting of two b0 v - iv stars of similar temperature : @xmath154 k. it is the only `` classical '' well - detached system included in the subset of likely distance indicators  the fractional radii of both components are below 0.2 .",
    "the residuals of solution are very small and only some larger scatter can be seen during eclipses due to very fast apsidal motion . the rate of the motion is @xmath155 58/year , so the apsidal period @xmath95 is only @xmath156 years .",
    "thus the analysis of this system can give parallel information about the components and an independent check of stellar evolution models .",
    "the expected velocity semiamplitudes should be @xmath157 km / s and @xmath158 km / s .      the brightest binary in the sample ( @xmath159 ) with the spectrum b0 v - iv + b1 iv .",
    "table  [ tab : par ] suggests that the cooler component is more massive one and it is slightly evolved .",
    "the light curve solution showed that the contribution of the third light to this system might be neglected and photometric parameters such as the temperature ratio ( surface brightness ratio ) could be very accurately determined .",
    "also very small residuals suggested that the system had no essential intrinsic variability .",
    "this system was yet used by harries et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for a distance determination to smc giving @xmath160 .",
    "the physical parameters of both components are reasonably close to that presented in table  [ tab : par ] .",
    "it can be considered as an independent check of the method given in section  [ physics ] and an additional argument for use this star for an accurate individual distance determination .",
    "ww1 included this binary in their catalog on the basis of having complete eclipses but the present analysis ( and results of harries et al . )",
    "exludes this suggestion .",
    "harries et al .  ( 2003 ) determined absolute dimensions and a distance to this b0v+b0v system : @xmath161 .",
    "their light curve solution is essentially the same as the solution reported in this paper .",
    "however , there is an apparent discrepancy between the observational data on sc5 38089 and the mass - luminosity relationship shown on fig  [ fig : law ] .",
    "thus i would not recommended this star for individual distance determination , although it is very interested target for spectroscopic investigations in the future .",
    "table  [ tab : par ] gives the estimate of physical parameters assuming that both components are normal main sequence stars .",
    "the expected @xmath32 luminosity ratio is very close to unity what indeed was reported by harries et al .",
    "formally this binary also seems to have complete eclipses ( it was included by ww1 in their subset of binaries showing totality ) but the very large third light contribution ( @xmath162 ) may cause serious problems during modelling of the spectral energy distribution and thus i decided not to include this star into the most suitable candidates .",
    "ww2 included this binary according to the presence of complete eclipses , but as in the case of sc6 215965 , the light curve analysis contradicted this thesis .",
    "the third light contribution to this system is sunstantial , at about 26% .",
    "this binary has small residuals , a very smooth light curve and can be considered as a `` reserve '' candidate .",
    "the mass ratio and temperature ratio are very close to unity .",
    "the expected velocity amplitude is @xmath163 km / s for both components .",
    "ww1 classified this system as a well - detached .",
    "indeed , my analysis showed that the components had the smallest fractional radii of all the sample ( beside sc6 67221 ) and are normal b2 v stars .",
    "however , this binary happens to blend with another eclipsing binary ( see  2.2 ) which contributes about 30% to the total light of system .",
    "thus any detailed analysis of sc6 11143 should at the same time take into account a careful analysis of the blending binary .",
    "probably this includes simultaneous solution of multicolour light curves of both binaries what is , in principle , possible , but may give ambiguous results .",
    "this binary was included by ww1 according to the presence of complete eclipses which seems to be incorrect in the view of my analysis .",
    "this binary had the highest @xmath1 contribution from all the sample  nearly 50 %  which is most probably too large for a detailed modelling of spectrophotometry .",
    "the observed difference of the @xmath1 contribution to the total light between binaries from a and b subsets may be understood as follows .",
    "the components of binaries from b subset are relatively much closer to each other than those from a subset and the proximity effects , depending on the gravitational distortion and overall geometry of the system , are much more distinct .",
    "thus proximity effects give us additional constraints to the solution .",
    "when we consider the third light @xmath1 we see that its influence on the light curve of well - detached systems is of little importance : equally good solutions can be obtained for wide range of @xmath1 values .    the situation is different for closer systems  small changes of @xmath1 produce noticeably systematic o - c residuals , especially near quadratures .",
    "this is an important reason for preferring such systems over classical well - detached systems in determination of the distance using individual eclipsing binaries , especially in the case of the extragalactic binaries observed usually on a rich stellar background of a host galaxy .",
    "the probability of blending with another star(s ) in such environment is high ( crowding effect ) .",
    "also the blend may be a member of the system itself as at least 30% of binaries ( batten 1973 ) are found to form hierarchical multiple systems of stars .",
    "indeed , neglecting of the third light contribution in the case of hv 2274 and hv 982 may be one of the prime sources of small differences on the level 1.5@xmath164 between distances derived for three lmc systems as was announced by ribas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the idea of deriving the absolute properties of binary stars from knowledge of their photometric properties alone has long tradition ( e.g.  gaposchkin 1938 , kopal 1959 - chapter  7 ) . the methods based on this idea use somewhat statistical approach : one or both components of a binary conform an empirical mass - luminosity relation and the temperature is imposed by observed spectral type .",
    "there are two important advantages of such statistical method 1 ) it may be used for large samples of binaries and 2 ) it gives fast , though approximate physical parameters of binaries .",
    "afterward we can choose from the sample most interesting systems and investigate them more accurately using spectroscopy , spectrophotometry or multicolor photometry .",
    "however , past methods neglected the interstellar reddening ( which influences both the brightness and the colours ) and , what is more important , the distance to the binary . as a matter of fact the distance is irrelevant to these methods and thus it can be derived simply by comparison with the apparent magnitude @xmath165 , even without any radial velocity measurements ( e.g.  gaposchkin 1968 , dworak 1974 ) .",
    "moreover , they based their reasoning on quite crude spectral type - temperature calibrations and , of course , as the temperature come in high powers into equations involved in the method , the obtained parameters were usually very inaccurate .    in present paper",
    "this `` old - fashioned '' method was innovated to account for the interstellar reddening @xmath138 and recent @xmath12 colour - temperature calibration ( flower 1996 ) .",
    "it turns out that such approach causes a big improvement in the temperature determination and overall physical parameters as was demonstrated by an accurate `` reproducing '' of absolute dimensions of three lmc eclipsing binaries .",
    "however , it was done for a little bit larger distance to lmc than the distance derived , on average , from these lmc stars .",
    "a shift of the distance modulus @xmath166 is quite small and comes probably from some inaccuracies of flower s temperature or / and bolometric corrections calibration for hot stars .",
    "anyway we should expect that this kind of method may give fast approximate determination of absolute dimensions for many binaries in the magellanic clouds , especially as we have large archives of binaries discovered by ogle , macho and eros projects at our disposal , and may be used also for eclipsing binaries in other close galaxies in the near future .",

    "i would like to thank professor andrzej udalski for his comments on ogle database and dr tnu viik for reading the manuscript ."

    "<S> the solutions were obtained by a modified version of the wilson - devinney program . the quality of dia light curves  a good phase coverage and relatively small scatter  </S>",
    "<S> is enough to calculate realistic estimates for the third light @xmath1 and the argument of periastron @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that solutions of detached , eccentric systems with flat light curve between eclipses usually may suffer from indetermination of @xmath1 in contrast to those of similar systems having some proximity effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties of the stars were estimated on the basis of their photometric elements and indices assuming the distance modulus to smc @xmath3 and consistency between an empirical mass - luminosity relation and the flux scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the method was tested on three lmc stars of known absolute dimensions and a good agreement was found for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach may give fast and accurate estimates of absolute dimensions for large and homogeneous samples of eclipsing binaries in the magellanic clouds and other close galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this method allows also for independent estimation of in the direction to a particular binary . </S>",
    "<S> the subset of six bright deb s worth future intensive investigations as likely distance indicators to smc , was chosen . </S>",
    "<S> they are sc3 139376 , sc4 53898 , sc5 129441 , sc6 67221 , sc6 215965 and sc9 175336 .    </S>",
