    "the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  ions form the backbone of interstellar chemistry and are important probes of the cosmic ray ionization rates in diffuse clouds , on the surfaces ( @xmath18 ) of molecular clouds , and ( with less reliability as we will discuss in this paper ) in the interiors ( @xmath19 ) of molecular clouds .",
    "they are the backbone of chemistry because once h@xmath1 forms , cosmic ray ionization of h or h@xmath1 leads to the formation of these ions , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  recombination with electrons leads to oh and h@xmath1o .",
    "reaction of oh with c or c@xmath0 leads to co. ion , which we do not discuss in detail in this paper although it is included in our models . ]",
    "once these basic molecules are formed , many of the other polyatomic and rare species follow .",
    "the pathway of cosmic ray ionization of hydrogen to these molecular ions follows two routes ( see figure 1 ) . in gas with significant h atoms",
    "the ionization of h leads to h@xmath0 that then proceeds via a series of reactions ( see figure 1 top ) to oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0  and h@xmath2o@xmath0  ions .",
    "we note that the charge exchange of o with h@xmath0 is slightly endothermic , so the reaction rate is proportional to exp(-230 k/@xmath20 ) ; this means that this reaction slows down at cooler temperatures , and a greater fraction of the cosmic ray ionizations of h are followed by recombination of h@xmath0 with neutral or negatively charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs or pah@xmath21 ) or electrons rather than proceeding to form o@xmath0 and then oh@xmath0 .",
    "it is this atomic route to oh@xmath0  which is primarily important in diffuse clouds and in the @xmath22 surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "a second route dominates deeper in the opaque interiors of molecular clouds . here",
    "the ionization of h@xmath1 leads to h@xmath23 , which then proceeds via a series of reactions ( see figure 1 bottom ) to oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0  and h@xmath2o@xmath0 .",
    "a key competitor here to the formation of oh@xmath0  is the dissociative recombination of h@xmath24 with electrons , which has a high rate coefficient compared to the reaction of h@xmath24 with o. in addition , the reaction of h@xmath24 with co dominates that with o when the co abundance exceeds that of o. therefore , low electron abundances and high o abundances are needed to ensure that a large fraction of cosmic ray ionizations of h@xmath1 eventually produces oh@xmath0 .    as we shall show in this paper ,",
    "these two routes lead generally to two peaks in the abundances of oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  as a function of depth or @xmath13 into a cloud .",
    "the first peak ( at @xmath25 depending on the ratio of the incident fuv flux to the gas density ) occurs in atomic gas where the cosmic ray ionization of h begins the chemical chain .",
    "] the second peak ( at @xmath4 , again dependent on the fuv flux / gas density ratio ) occurs in molecular gas where the cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath1 begins the chemical chain .",
    "deeper in the cloud the gas phase oxygen freezes out as water ice on grain surfaces ( e.g. , hollenbach et al 2009 , hereafter h09 ) , and the gas phase abundances of the three ions drop . whereas significant columns of oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0  are produced in the first peak , most of the h@xmath2o@xmath0  column arises in the second peak .    in warm ( @xmath26 k ) neutral gas with significant abundances of h@xmath1",
    "there are other dominant pathways to form oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  ions than the two paths initiated by cosmic rays and shown in figure 1 .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to show under what conditions ( e.g. , fuv flux , gas density , cosmic ray ionization rate ) cosmic rays initiate the formation of the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  ions , and under what conditions other chemical routes dominate .",
    "if cosmic rays dominate , then the observed columns of oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  serve as a probe of the cosmic ray ionization rate .",
    "the major goal of this paper is to show how these columns depend on the cosmic ray ionization rate , the gas density , the fuv flux , the total column or optical extinction @xmath27 through the cloud , and the molecular hydrogen abundance .",
    "comparison with our models allow the cosmic ray ionization rate to be estimated from these ion columns and the atomic h column .",
    "our method of estimating cosmic ray ionization rates from the abundance of eventual products of this ionization dates back to the 1970 s , when black & dalgarno ( 1973 ) pointed out the sensitivity of the oh and hd abundances to cosmic ray ionization rates .",
    "a later comprehensive paper by van dishoeck & black ( 1986 ) showed how the abundance of oh in diffuse or translucent clouds could be used to estimate the cosmic ray rate .",
    "one advantage of using oh@xmath0  or h@xmath1o@xmath0  to probe cosmic ray ionization rates over using oh is that oh is produced after a series of reactions following the formation of oh@xmath0  ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this makes the inference of cosmic ray ionization rate dependent on knowledge of the rate coefficients of these additional reactions .",
    "recent observations strongly motivate the theoretical study of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 molecular ions . prior to 2010",
    ", the only observations of these three ions within the interstellar medium ion has long been observed in cometary comae ( e.g. wehinger et al .",
    "1974 ) , where it is produced by the photoionization of water by solar ultraviolet radiation . ]",
    "consisted of a few detections of @xmath30 in rich interstellar sources of submillimeter line emission and absorption ( wootten et al 1991 ; phillips , van dishoeck & keene 1992 , hereafter pvdk92 ; goicoechea & cernicharo 2001 ; van der tak et al 2006 ) .",
    "thanks largely to absorption - line spectroscopy with the hifi instrument on the _ herschel space observatory _ , together with additional ground - based detections of oh@xmath0 obtained with the apex telescope ( submillimeter rotational transition ) and the eso paranal observatory ( near - uv electronic transition ) ,",
    "the observational picture has improved radically over the past two years .",
    "all three molecular ions have now been detected in both the diffuse and dense galactic interstellar medium ( gerin et al .",

    "; aalto et al 2011 ) .",
    "the most reliable column density determinations are obtained for foreground molecular clouds lying along the sight - lines to bright submillimeter continuum sources in the galactic disk . here , the absorbing material typically covers a wide range of line - of - sight velocities , arising in widely distributed material along the sight - line .",
    "the total inferred column densities of the ions lie in the range @xmath31 , the largest values being attained for @xmath28 and the smallest for @xmath30 ( gerin et al .",
    "2010 ; neufeld et al .",
    "2010 ) . in their study of oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 absorption along the sight - line to the luminous star - forming region w49n , neufeld et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter n10 ) measured an average oh@xmath0/h@xmath1o@xmath0 abundance ratio of @xmath32 , with variations over the range @xmath33 .",
    "these observed ratios are considerably larger than the value @xmath34 expected in fully molecular gas",
    ".  formation is followed by h@xmath1o@xmath0  formation and the destruction rate per ion is nearly the same ( due to reaction with h@xmath1 ) , leading to similar abundances for both ions ( n10 ) . ] by means of a simple analytical treatment of the chemistry of oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 , confirmed by more detailed pure gas - phase models performed using the meudon pdr model ( le petit et al 2006 ; goicoechea & le bourlot 2007 ) , n10 concluded that the molecular fraction in the absorbing material lies in the range 2  8 @xmath35 .",
    "this conclusion was supported by the observed distribution in velocity space of the oh@xmath0 and @xmath29 absorption , which proved similar to that of the atomic gas probed by 21 cm absorption studies , and quite dissimilar from that of the molecular gas traced by hf or ch absorption .",
    "the analytic treatment introduced by n10 also allowed the cosmic ray ionization rate to be inferred from the abundances of oh@xmath0 and @xmath29 relative to atomic hydrogen .",
    "the resulting estimate of the cosmic ray ionization rate in the range @xmath7= 0.6  2.4 @xmath36 ( primary ionization rate per h atom ) was broadly consistent with earlier values inferred quite independently from observations of the h@xmath24 molecular ion toward different sight lines ( indriolo et al .",
    "one of the goals of the present study is to refine the n10 analytic treatment of diffuse cloud chemistry through detailed modeling , as an aid to interpreting the growing body of observational data now available .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 we describe the chemical / thermal model of both an opaque molecular cloud illuminated by fuv radiation , or a diffuse cloud illuminated by the interstellar radiation field . in ",
    "3 we show the model columns and column ratios of oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0   as functions of the cloud gas density @xmath8 , the incident fuv flux @xmath37 ( in units of the local average interstellar field , see below ) , and the primary cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath7  per h atom for the case of opaque molecular clouds .",
    "we also show the same results for diffuse clouds , but with the total column or @xmath27 through the cloud as an additional parameter . in ",
    "4 we compare our model results with previous h@xmath2o@xmath0  observations and recent oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  observations by _ herschel _ , and show how observations compared to models can constrain the cosmic ray ionization rates .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "appendix a presents tables of key reaction rate coefficients and adopted abundances and grain parameters .",
    "appendix b includes analytic expressions that explain the variation of oh@xmath0   with @xmath13 over the first peak , and the variation of h@xmath2o@xmath0  with @xmath13 over the second peak .",
    "appendix c assesses the sensitivity of our results to certain chemical rate coefficients , the gas phase abundance of elemental oxygen and low ionization potential metals , and the freeze - out of species .",
    "the numerical code we have developed to model the chemical and thermal structure of an opaque cloud externally illuminated by fuv flux is based on our previous pdr model described in h09 .",
    "this 1d code models a constant density @xmath8 ( the hydrogen nucleus density ) slab of gas , illuminated from one side by an fuv flux of @xmath38 erg @xmath11 s@xmath15 incident perpendicular to the slab .",
    "the unitless parameter @xmath37 is defined above in such a way that @xmath39 corresponds to the average local interstellar radiation field in the fuv band ( draine 1978 ) . corresponds to @xmath40 in the tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) units based on the habing ( 1968 ) local interstellar radiation field .",
    "the shape of the fuv spectrum for @xmath41 is implicitly assumed to mimic that of the draine field , which is approximately that of a @xmath42 k star . ]",
    "the code calculates the steady state chemical abundances and the gas temperature from thermal balance as a function of depth into the cloud .",
    "it incorporates 63 chemical species , @xmath43 chemical reactions , and a large number of heating mechanisms and cooling processes .",
    "the chemical reactions include fuv photoionization and photodissociation ; cosmic ray ionization ; neutral - neutral , ion - neutral , and electronic recombination reactions .",
    "h@xmath1 self - shielding is included as described in h09 , and co self - shielding and the partial shielding of co by h@xmath1 is included as described in visser et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "the code includes the photodissociation of molecules by ",
    "secondary \" fuv photons produced ( ultimately ) by cosmic rays ( prasad & tarafdar 1983 ) .",
    "we also include reactions with charged dust grains and pahs ; and the formation of h@xmath1 , oh , h@xmath1o , ch , ch@xmath1 , ch@xmath2 , and ch@xmath44 on grain surfaces .",
    "the code treats the freezing of all condensable species to grain surfaces and three desorption processes : thermal desorption , photodesorption , and cosmic ray desorption .",
    "the only significant difference in the desorption code used here versus the h09 code is the inclusion of the new ( higher by factor @xmath45 ) rate of photodesorption of co ( oberg et al 2009 ) .",
    "the code does not include photodesorption by the secondary fuv photons ; this process is negligible at the peaks in the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  abundances .",
    "the code has been used to model regions which lie at hydrogen nucleus column densities @xmath46 @xmath11 ( or @xmath47 ) from the surface of a cloud .",
    "therefore , it applies not only to the photodissociated surface region , where gas phase hydrogen and oxygen are nearly entirely atomic and where gas phase carbon is mostly c@xmath0 , but also to regions deeper into the molecular cloud where hydrogen is in h@xmath1 molecules and carbon is in co molecules . even in these molecular regions ,",
    "the attenuated fuv field can play a significant role in photodissociating h@xmath1o and o@xmath1 , in photodesorbing species adsorbed on grain surfaces , and in heating the gas .",
    "however , the code is now sufficiently general that it finds the steady state solutions for abundances and temperature in any region of a molecular cloud , even where fuv is insignificant .",
    "we emphasize that we present a steady - state model of chemical abundances as a function of depth into the cloud .",
    "the chemical timescales can be quite long , which might suggest that time dependent models are more appropriate .",
    "for example , the timescale to convert atomic h gas to fully molecular h@xmath1 gas is @xmath48 years , where @xmath8 is the hydrogen nucleus density in units of @xmath49 .",
    "however , as we show below , the oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0  ions peak in abundance when @xmath50h@xmath51 , which occur typically at @xmath52 .",
    "[ note , abundances in this paper are defined relative to hydrogen nuclei , so that @xmath50h@xmath53h@xmath54 and @xmath55h@xmath56h@xmath1 ) ]",
    ". therefore , the timescales for even diffuse clouds of density @xmath57 @xmath49 to reach these abundances are less than @xmath58 years , which is shorter than the typical lifetime of a diffuse cloud ( wolfire et al 2003 ) .",
    "steady state solutions therefore generally apply , at least for computing the columns of these ions .",
    "the steady state models may somewhat underestimate the ion columns for low density diffuse clouds with @xmath59 , since the steady state solutions can lead to lower abundances of these two ions than time dependent solutions in the high @xmath13 regions .",
    "this arises because the steady state abundances of h@xmath1 are higher than time dependent models which start with fully atomic gas .",
    "higher h@xmath1 abundances lead to more destruction of oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0   in the high @xmath13 regions where h@xmath1 and not electrons dominate the destruction of these ions .",
    "liszt ( 2007 ) provides a detailed analysis of the time dependent formation of h@xmath1 and oh@xmath0  as a function of @xmath13 in diffuse clouds with initial atomic conditions .",
    "we also emphasize that our model does not include turbulent dissipation and heating of small pockets of gas along the line of sight ( e.g. , godard , falgarone , & pineau des forets 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "we do , however , run pdr models with small fractions of the line of sight having either enhanced temperature or enhanced rates of ion - neutral drift to test the possible effects of turbulence , and find the effects on oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , h@xmath2o@xmath0  column densities are likely small .    for simplicity",
    "we assume constant h nucleus density @xmath8 in our models . at low @xmath13 and low @xmath60 , where much of the oh@xmath0   and h@xmath1o@xmath0",
    "columns often arise , the temperature is quite constant so that constant density implies constant thermal pressure .",
    "if thermal pressure ( and not turbulence ) dominates deeper into a high @xmath13 cloud , then the density will rise as one moves from its warmer pdr surface to its co - cooled molecular interior .",
    "in addition , self gravity can raise the density of the interior regions at higher @xmath13 .",
    "still another effect is the transition of atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen which can raise @xmath8 by a factor of 2 if thermal pressure is conserved .",
    "we ignore the possible rise in density , which mainly affects the second peaks of the ions deep ( @xmath61 ) in the cloud .",
    "if such a density enhancement occurs , it tends to depress the abundances of oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0  in the second peaks , but the abundance of h@xmath2o@xmath0  at the second peak is not sensitive to hydrogen density if pahs are present(see  3 ) .",
    "of a given source there , then our models with that @xmath8 will give a good prediction of the behavior of the second peaks . ]",
    "the second peak is dependent on the abundance of pahs , very small grains and low ionization potential metal ions there , which can control the electron density , @xmath62 .",
    "the abundance of pahs and very small grains at high @xmath13 is uncertain due to their possible coagulation on larger grain surfaces .",
    "one significant difference between the chemical code used in this paper and that used in h09 is the inclusion of pahs and very small grains ( vsgs , radius @xmath63  ) , which affect the ionization balance by enhancing the recombination of positive atomic ions . in the rest of this paper",
    "we shall often use the term  pah \" to denote both pahs and vsgs .",
    "pahs also affect the second peaks of the ions by destroying electrons in the reaction e + pah @xmath64 pah@xmath21 .",
    "( the effects of pahs on ionization balance has been treated extensively before in the literature : e.g. , lepp & dalgarno 1988 , bakes & tielens 1998 , weingartner & draine 2001a , flower & pineau des forets 2003 , liszt 2003 , wolfire et al 2003 , 2008 ) .",
    "h09 focused on the h@xmath1o and o@xmath1 peaks , which occur at relatively high @xmath65 .",
    "although the pah abundances are not known deep in molecular clouds , h09 assumed that their abundances are low , due to coagulation of pahs on the surfaces of larger dust grains . here , however , we are mostly interested in the chemistry at low @xmath18 , and in particular in the chemistry of diffuse clouds .",
    "these are the regions where pahs are observed to be present , and we use pah parameters derived from the literature . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt a single size pah for the pah distribution , and assume that the standard pah has 100 c atoms , and a number abundance of @xmath66 with respect to h nuclei ( see wolfire et al 2008 for a discussion of the amount of carbon in pahs ; here we adopt 100 c atoms and not the 35 c atoms that wolfire et al adopted because of the result of draine & li 2007 , which suggested that the distribution in mass peaks at 100 c atoms ) .",
    "one of the key impacts of pahs is in the recombination of h@xmath0 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 ( top ) , cosmic ray ionization of h can lead to oh@xmath0 , but a competing route is the neutralization of h@xmath0 by an electron , pah , or pah@xmath21 .",
    "pahs therefore lower the production of oh@xmath0 and the columns of all the ions in the first peak .",
    "conversely , in the second peaks , the reduction in electron abundance caused by pahs cause fewer h@xmath24 ions to recombine with electrons , and lead to greater production rates of the ions as well as smaller destruction rates for h@xmath2o@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the columns of the ions increase with the presence of pahs in the second peaks .",
    "we also discuss results with no pahs or very small grains at high @xmath13 .    in appendix a we present table 1 which lists the rate coefficients of key reactions in the pathways to the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  ions , as well as reactions that are either new or changed since h09 .",
    "of particular note here are the photoionization of oh and h@xmath1o , the photodissociation of oh@xmath0 and h@xmath1o@xmath0 , the treatment of pahs  especially the photodetachment reaction rate for pah@xmath21 , the fine structure level population dependence in the charge exchange reaction of o with h@xmath0 , and some minor modifications in reaction rates key to determining the abundances of the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  ions , such as their dissociative recombination rates with electrons and their reactions rates with h@xmath1 .    we have also included in table 1 rates that are important in producing h@xmath0 by chemical means rather than by cosmic ray ionization of h in pdrs .",
    "there are two main chemical routes .",
    "the first is initiated by the fuv photoionization of c to c@xmath0 .",
    "the c@xmath0 reacts with oh to form co@xmath0 .",
    "the co@xmath0 charge exchanges with h to form h@xmath0 .",
    "the second is also initiated by fuv photoionization of c to c@xmath0 .",
    "the c@xmath0 reacts with h@xmath1 to form ch@xmath0 .",
    "the ch@xmath0 is photodissociated by fuv photons to produce h@xmath0 .",
    "both these reaction chains are very much enhanced by high ( @xmath67 k ) temperatures in gas with appreciable h@xmath1 .",
    "the first chain is enhanced because high gas temperatures lead to significant amounts of oh being formed by the reaction h@xmath1 + o @xmath64 oh + h. this reaction has an activation barrier of @xmath68 k and so is insignificant for low gas temperatures .",
    "the second chain similarly is enhanced because the reaction c@xmath0 + h@xmath1 @xmath64 ch@xmath0 + h has an activation barrier of @xmath69 k ( see table 1 ) .",
    "with c@xmath0 to form ch@xmath0 .",
    "this reaction has no activation barrier and can be moderately important at low @xmath70 . ] in regions where either of these two chains dominate the production of h@xmath0 over cosmic ray ionization , the ions oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0   only provide upper limits to the cosmic ray ionization rates .",
    "other alternate routes to the production of oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0  ions include three routes which produce oh or h@xmath1o without the ions : the production of water on grain surfaces followed by photodesorption of the water to produce gas phase oh and h@xmath1o , the radiative association of o with h to form oh , and the reaction of fuv - pumped h@xmath1 in excited vibrational states with o to form oh . the gas phase oh and h@xmath1o can be photoionized by fuv photons to produce oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0  ( see table 1 ) . unlike the routes described in the preceeding paragraphs , these routes are never dominant in producing the ion column densities",
    ".    an analogous route to the formation of h@xmath1o on grain surfaces followed by photodesorption , but one not treated in this work , is the time - dependent evaporation of water ice which occurs around newly formed stars .",
    "the rapid rise in embedded luminosity heats the dust grains above about 100 k , and the icy mantles on grains are then thermally evaporated .",
    "this sudden injection of high abundances of water vapor into the gas is followed by reaction of the gas phase water with hco@xmath0 and h@xmath24 to form h@xmath2o@xmath0 .",
    "eventually , the system relaxes to the steady state chemistry described in this paper , but for a short time , there might be a large enhancement in h@xmath2o@xmath0  ( millar , herbst , & charnley 1991 , pvdk92 ) .",
    "if this release of h@xmath1o from the icy grain surface to the gas occurs in regions with elevated fuv fields , the photoionization of h@xmath1o could also result in enhanced h@xmath1o@xmath0  abundances ( gupta et al 2010 )    we also present in appendix a table 2 , which lists the gas phase elemental abundances , the pah properties , and the grain surface area per h nucleus adopted in our code .      as noted above",
    ", our opaque molecular cloud models invoke a constant density @xmath8 slab , illuminated from one side by a 1d normal fuv flux @xmath37 .",
    "we solve for the gas temperature and the gas phase and ice abundances of the various species as a function of depth in the slab .",
    "note that depth is synonymous with hydrogen nucleus column @xmath9 [ = @xmath9(h)+2@xmath9(h@xmath1 ) ] into the cloud or @xmath13 into the cloud .",

    "we use the primary cosmic ray ionization rate per h atom as an input parameter , since our code calculates the secondary ionizations caused by cosmic rays and these depend on the h@xmath1 and electron abundances . in order to probe the range of cosmic ray ionization rates suggested in the literature , we include cases with primary ionization rates of @xmath7@xmath73 s@xmath15 and @xmath74 s@xmath15 per h atom , which correspond to total rates ( including secondary ionizations ) of about @xmath75 s@xmath15 and @xmath76 s@xmath15 respectively . note that the primary rate per h@xmath1 molecule is 2@xmath7 .",
    "we also adopt @xmath7  as the primary rate for he atoms ; however , he has insignificant secondary ionizations . although there is evidence that the cosmic ray ionization rate may decrease with depth ( e.g. , rimmer et al 2011 , indriolo & mccall 2012 , and discussion later in this paper ) , for simplicity we assume the primary cosmic ray ionization rate does not vary with depth into a cloud in a given model .",
    "the main effect of this assumption is that we may have overestimated the abundances and columns of the oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0  ions in the second ( deeper ) peak relative to the first peak .",

    "appendix b presents an analytic solution for @xmath130(h@xmath2o@xmath0 ) near the second peak if pahs are present . since cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath1 is similar to x - ray ionization of h@xmath1 , this result implies that , _ if pahs are present _ , regions of enhanced x - ray ionization will not show enhanced h@xmath2o@xmath0   columns .",
    "we discuss in  3.1.3 the case of no pahs at high @xmath13 .",

    "although this qualitative limit is clear from the chemical pathways shown in figure 1 , we derive in appendix b an analytic formula for @xmath160 which makes this statement more quantitative . roughly , the condition for @xmath160 to be of order unity is :    @xmath161\\ ] ]    however , if the reverse is true , then h@xmath0 can recombine with pah , pah@xmath21 , or electrons and disrupt the chain of reactions that lead to oh@xmath0 , leading to low ( @xmath162 ) values of @xmath160 .",
    "figure 4 also plots the temperature and repeats the plots of the abundances of h@xmath1 and electrons , since they help determine the value of @xmath160 , as well as the abundance of oh@xmath0  ( see appendix b ) .",
    "finally , we add the abundance of h@xmath24 to figure 4 since it is also used to estimate cosmic ray rates ( e.g. , indriolo et al 2007 , 2011 ) . because h@xmath24 is formed by the reaction of h@xmath1 with h@xmath23 and often destroyed by electrons ( see figure 1 ) , we see the h@xmath24 abundance rise with @xmath13 as the h@xmath1 abundance rises and the electron abundance falls . in general , the h@xmath24 probes the cosmic ray ionization rates at higher @xmath13 than the first peak in oh@xmath0",
    ".    figures 5 and 6 show the case @xmath163 @xmath49 , @xmath164 , and @xmath7= @xmath165 s@xmath15 .",
    "this case is nearly identical to the standard case in h09 , and is representative of a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) surface illuminated by an fuv field somewhat higher than the interstellar radiation field because of the presence of nearby o and b stars",
    ". the total cosmic ray ionization rate ( @xmath166 s@xmath15 including secondary ionizations ) may represent values on the surfaces of gmcs , but may be somewhat high for the interior .",
    "we see from figures 4 and 6 that the gas temperatures of the molecular interiors of these clouds at @xmath167 is of order 30 k for @xmath168 @xmath49 and 70 k for @xmath169 @xmath49 , due to cosmic ray heating when @xmath7= @xmath146 s@xmath15 .",
    "typically , temperatures in molecular cloud interiors are observed to be @xmath170 k , suggesting that such high cosmic ray ionization rates may not be appropriate for molecular cloud interiors .",
    "however , as we shall see , such high cosmic ray rates are required to explain observations of diffuse clouds , which should have the same cosmic ray rates as the surfaces ( @xmath22 ) of gmcs .",
    "this suggests that @xmath7  may be higher on the surface of a molecular cloud than deep in its interior .",
    "if chemistry is driven by fuv photoreactions and particle - particle reactions , such as h / h@xmath1 chemistry , then the chemical abundances mainly depend on the ratio @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , one expects and sees that the h@xmath1 abundance of figure 5 closely matches that of figures 2 and 3 , which have the same @xmath171 ratio .",
    "the h@xmath1 abundance in the higher @xmath37 case is a bit lower because of fuv photodissociation of h@xmath1 in fuv - pumped excited vibrational states of h@xmath1 .",
    "however , the molecular ion abundances in the first peak depend to first order on the ratio @xmath7/@xmath8 ( see appendix b ) and are not too sensitive to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in this @xmath163 @xmath49 case , their abundances in the first peak drop by a factor of nearly 10 - 30 compared to figure 3 ( which has the same value of @xmath7 ) as the density rises by 100 from the @xmath114 @xmath49 assumed in figure 3 .",

    "figures 7 shows the case @xmath174 @xmath49 , @xmath175 , and @xmath7= @xmath146 s@xmath15 . this case may represent strongly illuminated pdrs such as may occur around embedded compact or ultracompact hii regions , or possibly embedded protostars illuminating the opaque walls of outflow cones . this",
    "high density and high fuv flux case was chosen because most of the column of all three ions is produced not by cosmic ray ionization , but by other chemical reactions . in figure 7",
    "we see an enormous enhancement of oh@xmath0abundance at @xmath176 . here , @xmath177 k and at the same time the abundance of h@xmath1 is moderately high , @xmath178 . at these elevated temperatures ,",
    "as discussed in  2.1 , the h@xmath1 can react rapidly with o to form oh or with c@xmath0 to form ch@xmath0 , leading to reaction chains that make oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0 .",
    "one of the key heating mechanisms providing this high @xmath20 is the fuv pumping and the h@xmath1 formation pumping of excited vibrational levels of h@xmath1 , followed by collisional de - excitation of these levels which leads to gas heating ( e.g. , tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) .",
    "the essential point is that the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0   columns are not provided by cosmic ray ionization , and therefore can not diagnose the cosmic ray ionization rate , except to give an upper limit .",

    "there is a weak dependence on @xmath37 for @xmath5 because higher @xmath37 leads to higher gas @xmath20 , and the o@xmath0 abundance rises with exp(-230 k/@xmath20 ) .",
    "from this figure it is clear that since oh@xmath0  columns of at least @xmath184 @xmath11 are needed to make absorption observations feasible , low density ( @xmath185 @xmath49 ) clouds should be targeted if @xmath7= @xmath146 s@xmath15 .",
    "it should also be noted , as is obvious in figures 2 , 3 and 5 , that both the first and second peaks contribute to the oh@xmath0   column so that there is substantial column at both @xmath186 and @xmath187 . the oh@xmath0  in this case is quite cold , @xmath188 k. second",

    "then becomes        equation ( 3 ) shows that pah@xmath21 in particular can lower @xmath160 by neutralizing h@xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that equations ( 3 - 5 ) are valid only if the pah and pah@xmath21 rate coefficients we have adopted in table 1 are valid .",
    "equations ( 4 - 5 ) assume the standard pah and pah@xmath21 abundances given above .    rather than a simple saturated value of @xmath160 at high @xmath130(h@xmath1 ) , however , we see in the figures that the first peak in oh@xmath0  shows a value of @xmath160 that peaks and then falls with increasing depth , once most of the gas is h@xmath1 . this is because once the gas is more than half molecular ( @xmath541 ) , the cosmic ray ionization is mostly of h@xmath1 , which we have not included in the analytic treatment",
    ". the route to oh@xmath0  via the ionization of h@xmath1 is not as efficient at the surface , because of the high abundance of electrons which react quickly with h@xmath24 .",
    "thus , as @xmath130(h ) declines deeper into the cloud , the value of @xmath160 falls with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "the analytic equation for @xmath50oh@xmath0@xmath542 requires the addition of reactions of oh@xmath0  with electrons and h@xmath1 that destroy oh@xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath543 be the rate coefficient for the destruction of oh@xmath0  by h@xmath1 , and @xmath544 be the coefficient for destruction by electrons .",
    "then , we find          again , we can break this equation into two regimes . for @xmath50h@xmath1)@xmath548 , oh@xmath0",
    "is mainly destroyed by dissociative recombination with electrons and the second term in the denominator can be ignored .",
    "then , assuming standard parameters for the abundances of @xmath156 , @xmath130(pah ) , and @xmath130(pah@xmath21 ) , we obtain @xmath549 however , if @xmath550h@xmath1)@xmath551 , then h@xmath1 mainly destroys oh@xmath0  and , again using standard values for the parameters , we obtain the peak and plateau value of the oh@xmath0  abundance :      for higher values of @xmath50h@xmath553 , the abundance of oh@xmath0  declines as @xmath160 saturates , and as @xmath130(h ) declines leading to the less efficient production of oh@xmath0  initiated by cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath1 . the column of oh@xmath0  in the first peak can then be estimated @xmath554 where @xmath555 is the width of the peak region .",
    "this shows the important result that the peak abundance ( and approximately the column of oh@xmath0  in the first peak ) is proportional to @xmath556 . in order to find regions of high oh@xmath0  column that can be observed , and where cosmic rays are the ultimate cause of the ions , we therefore must look at low density regions with high cosmic ray ionization rates .",
    "_ analytic solution to the second peak of h@xmath2o@xmath0  in the regime @xmath557 and with pahs present_. deeper in the cloud ( @xmath187 ) the dust and gas shield the fuv photons and carbon is no longer in the form of c@xmath0 but converts to co. here , the electron abundance drops rapidly with depth , and the gas is almost entirely molecular so that the route to h@xmath2o@xmath0  is started with the cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath1 .",
    "we then define @xmath160(h@xmath2o@xmath0 ) so that the rate of formation of h@xmath2o@xmath0  per unit volume is @xmath558(h@xmath2o@xmath0 ) .",
    ", then the total rate per h@xmath1 is roughly 2@xmath559 .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rate per unit volume is then 2@xmath560 in fully molecular zones .",
    "] again @xmath160(h@xmath2o@xmath0 ) is equivalent to the fraction of cosmic ray ionizations that lead to h@xmath2o@xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 shows the route to h@xmath2o@xmath0  from the ionization of h@xmath1 .",
    "the key competition that determines @xmath160(h@xmath2o@xmath0 ) revolves around h@xmath24 . with all the hydrogen molecular , the routes via h@xmath1 dominate the rates via electrons .",
    "thus , the only interruption in the chain that leads to h@xmath2o@xmath0  is the possibility that h@xmath24 will react with either electrons or co rather than with o to form either oh@xmath0  or h@xmath1o@xmath0 .",
    "we then define @xmath561 as the rate coefficient for h@xmath24 reacting with o to form either oh@xmath0  or h@xmath1o@xmath0 ; @xmath562 is the rate coefficient for h@xmath24 to dissociatively recombine with electrons ; @xmath563 is the rate coefficient for h@xmath24 to react with co ; and @xmath564 is the rate coefficient for h@xmath2o@xmath0  to dissociatively recombine with electrons ( all channels ) . therefore ,        we find in our model runs that electrons are formed by the cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath1 and destroyed by attachment to neutral pahs .",
    "most of the pahs deep in the cloud are neutral , and therefore using a neutral pah abundance of @xmath567 we find      if either o or co dominate the destruction of h@xmath24 over electrons ( or @xmath569 ) , which we find is usually the case for most of our runs at the second peak of the h@xmath2o@xmath0  abundance , then we find , substituting @xmath156 into the equation for @xmath570 ,      at the peak , we generally find that most of the carbon is in co , so @xmath572 and that most of the remaining o is atomic , or @xmath573 .",
    "therefore , we predict a peak h@xmath2o@xmath0abundance of @xmath574 this explains why the second peak abundance of h@xmath2o@xmath0  is independent of @xmath559 and @xmath8 .",
    "the production rate per unit volume of h@xmath2o@xmath0   depends on @xmath575 but the destruction rate per unit volume depends on @xmath576 . since electrons are formed by cosmic ray ionization and destroyed by pahs , @xmath577 .",
    "therefore , both production and destruction of h@xmath2o@xmath0  is proportional to @xmath575 , and the resulting abundance of h@xmath2o@xmath0  is independent of both parameters . as one goes to higher @xmath13 from the peak , the atomic o freezes out on grains as water ice , and thus the abundance of h@xmath2o@xmath0  declines .",
    "the thickness of the region of peak h@xmath2o@xmath0   abundance is therefore of order @xmath578 , or a hydrogen column of @xmath579 @xmath11 . multiplying this by @xmath580",
    ", we estimate columns of h@xmath2o@xmath0  of @xmath581 @xmath11 , as we found in our numerical runs .",
    "there has been some indication ( rimmer et al 2011 ) that the cosmic ray ionization rate may decline with depth into a cloud . from the above result",
    ", this should have little consequence on the h@xmath2o@xmath0  column .",
    "we should emphasize that this prediction is dependent on the presence of pahs deep ( @xmath582 ) in the cloud .",
    "if pahs coagulate on grain surfaces , then pahs do not remove free electrons from the gas phase . in this case , the electron abundance at the peak of the h@xmath2o@xmath0  can be higher than in the pah case if gas phase metal ions are present .",
    "this suppresses the h@xmath2o@xmath0abundance at the peak .",
    "therefore , the observation of high columns of h@xmath2o@xmath0  deep in molecular clouds may indicate either the presence of pahs lowering the electron abundances there , or , in the absence of pahs , may indicate a high depletion of gas phase metals at the second peak .",
    "recently , klippenstein et al ( 2010 ) have provided theoretical rate coefficients for the reactions of h@xmath24 with o and with co that are 10 to 20% higher than the rate coefficients we adopted .",
    "we have run our standard cases with these new coefficients and find that the columns of oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  increase by roughly 10% with the new coefficients .",
    "in addition , cartledge et al ( 2004 ) suggest a gas phase oxygen abundance of 2.84@xmath583 , whereas jensen et al ( 2005 ) suggest a value of 4.2 to 4.7@xmath583 .",
    "we have adopted 3.2@xmath583 but the variation in the literature suggests that we test the dependence of the ion columns on the gas phase abundance of elemental o. assuming an abundance of 4.5@xmath583 , an increase of 40% over our standard rate , increases the columns of oh@xmath0 , h@xmath1o@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0  by 10 - 20% .",
    "therefore , the slight possible variations in these rate coefficients and/or the gas phase elemental o abundance have a negligible effect on our conclusions .",
    "we have also tested our results for their sensitivity to the h@xmath1 formation rate coefficient for formation on grain surfaces .",
    "we find that lowering this rate by a factor of 3 hardly affects the results for high density gas , and that the effect is most pronounced at low density . at @xmath169 @xmath49 , lowering the h@xmath1 formation rate by 3 lowers the columns of oh@xmath0  and h@xmath1o@xmath0   by factors of less than 2 in both peaks .",
    "the h@xmath2o@xmath0   column in both peaks decreases by a bit less than a factor of 3 .",
    "the main effect of lowering the h@xmath1 rate coefficient is to drive the h / h@xmath1 transition deeper into the cloud , which moves the first peaks of the ions to greater depths , but their columns and peak abundances do not change appreciably .    in the text we discussed the effect of lowering the gas phase abundance of low ionization potential metal atoms such as s , fe , mg , and si if pahs are not present .",
    "here , we examine the effect of raising their abundances . our standard gas phase abundances for these species are given in table 2 of appendix a. in our test cases , we raise the gas phase abundances of these species to 10@xmath584 , a factor of 10 - 100 times their standard values . for our standard case of @xmath163 @xmath49 and @xmath7@xmath585 s@xmath15 , but with no pahs , this raises the electron abundance at high @xmath13 in the gas from about 10@xmath207 to about @xmath403 .",
    "this rise depresses the ( second ) peak abundance of h@xmath2o@xmath0  from about @xmath586 to about @xmath587 if the photodesorption yields of fe , mg , and si are @xmath588 , a likely upper limit ( h09 ) .",
    "smaller yields lower the electron abundance , thereby changing the h@xmath2o@xmath0  less .",
    "however , if pahs are present , metal ions recombine with pah@xmath21 and pah , which is a much faster process than with electrons .",
    "hence , the electron abundance does not depend much on the metal abundances .",
    "consequently , the ( second ) peak h@xmath2o@xmath0  abundance does not change significantly .",
    "the first peaks of the ions are not affected , because the electrons are supplied by c@xmath0 , whose gas phase abundance is more than 10 times the ( high ) abundance of the metal ions .",
    "section 4 discusses observations that indicate @xmath9(h@xmath2o@xmath0)@xmath589 @xmath590 @xmath11 in some clouds , possibly even as high as @xmath591 @xmath11 .",
    "the only way our models can accommodate very large columns of h@xmath2o@xmath0  in a single cloud is if there is incomplete freeze - out of water ice on grains .",
    "note that our models are steady state , so that time dependent effects might leave more elemental oxygen in the gas phase than steady state results would indicate .",
    "another possibility is that the grains are sufficiently warm , @xmath392 k , to thermally evaporate water ice off the grains , or that cosmic ray rates are sufficiently high to desorb the ice mantles .",
    "we have run our code fixing the grain temperature to be @xmath592 k , so that water ice can not form and elemental oxygen is plentiful in the gas phase at all @xmath13 . in the case of pahs , and for our standard case of @xmath163 @xmath49 and @xmath7@xmath143 s@xmath15 , we find that @xmath130(h@xmath2o@xmath0 ) plateaus at a value of about @xmath593 at about @xmath119 , and stays constant at that value for all higher @xmath13 .",
    "( note that given the discussion in  3.1 , this result is independent of @xmath7  and @xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , a cloud with a hydrogen nucleus column of @xmath594 @xmath11 would have @xmath9(h@xmath2o@xmath0)@xmath595 @xmath11 , for example . without pahs , and assuming the low ionization potential metal atoms strongly deplete on grains , we would predict similar columns .",
