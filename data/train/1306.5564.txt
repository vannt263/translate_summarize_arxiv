    "the interaction between black holes and matter in accreting systems is known to power emission across a wide spectrum , and provides the engine for exciting phenomena such as agns , blazars , quasars , etc .",
    "systems where a black hole interacts with a localized matter distribution also lie at the heart of other interesting astrophysical processes .",
    "for instance , black hole - star systems can give rise to strong tidal interactions that might induce supernova - like events  @xcite ; the disruption of stars by a supermassive black hole can trigger strong flares  @xcite ; stellar - mass black holes interacting with a neutron star can be responsible for short gamma - ray bursts  @xcite ; etc .",
    "the upcoming close encounter of our own sgra@xmath0 with a gas cloud ( g2 ) , expected for next year  @xcite , will provide unprecedented opportunities to study a nearby example of such interactions .",
    "the understanding of these systems requires dealing with diverse physics  gravity and matter at least  and therefore solving general relativistic hydrodynamic equations in dynamical , strongly gravitating scenarios . due to the complex and non - linear character of the underlying equations , numerical simulations are required to make realistic headways into the problem .",
    "this task , however , is formally complicated by several issues . first , depending on the problem under consideration , vastly different scales are involved ",
    "star and black - hole sizes  , as well as , potentially , extremely long dynamical times .",
    "second , the physical theories one has to employ  general relativity and relativistic hydrodynamics  are not only highly involved / non - linear , but also bring different characteristic timescales for propagating modes . in particular , general relativity dictates that gravitational degrees of freedom propagate at the speed of light , while hydrodynamic modes do so at the sound speed , which can be significantly lower .",
    "this implies , at a computational level , that a fully general - relativistic study is necessarily more costly than a non - relativistic one .",
    "there exist , however , a class of problems where propagating gravitational effects are secondary , and the above - mentioned limitation can be dealt with by suitable approximations .",
    "a typical approach is to assume that gravitational effects are described by newtonian gravity , where the gravitational field is determined via elliptic equations , which can be solved efficiently ( e.g.  @xcite ) once appropriate boundary conditions are specified .",
    "the only hyperbolic equations are then given by hydrodynamics and , as a consequence , the dynamical propagation speeds are given by the speed of sound , which allows considerably larger step - sizes to be adopted .",
    "gravitational radiation reaction may then be approximately included by using the quadrupole formula or higher - order extensions of it ( c.f .",
    "for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    however , for scenarios involving a black hole  even when ignoring propagating modes ",
    ", this strategy must be modified to incorporate crucial features brought by general relativity , which can not be ignored unless the star remains very far from the black hole through the whole regime of interest . a widely used approach",
    "to address this issue is to consider the gravitational potential sourced by the star , and add to it the so - called `` pacynski - wiita '' ( pv ) potential @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this method therefore amounts to a phenomenological modification to the newtonian potential , and guarantees the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco )  @xcite .",
    "the pv potential , however , does not depend on the black - hole spin , and thus can not properly describe rotating black holes . furthermore , even for non - spinning black holes , the isco has different orbital frequency and angular momentum than in a schwarzschild spacetime , even though it lies at @xmath2 , as for a schwarzchild spacetime in the usual areal coordinates .",
    "various increasingly sophisticated suggestions have been presented to partially address these shortcomings ( see e.g.  @xcite ) for non - spinning black holes .",
    "however , crucial features brought by the presence of a black hole are still not fully accounted for ( e.g. gravitational redshift , frame - dragging , gravitational radiation , etc . ) unless further ad - hoc ingredients are incorporated . naturally , since strong observational evidence indicates that gravitational waves exist and carry energy and angular momentum away from the system , as well as that black holes possess a variety of spins ( spanning the whole allowed range @xmath3 , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a better treatment of black hole effects on matter is desirable .    in this work , motivated by the above observations , we describe a systematic approach to treat the problem starting from the correct description in full general relativity , and introduce a post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion to capture relativistic effects in a consistent manner .",
    "this goal , as we describe below , has been pursued by other authors  either via fully general relativistic or approximate methods  but the resulting approaches require significantly revamping / altering traditional astrophysics modeling strategies .",
    "we thus adopt an approach that is intimately tied with the traditional `` newtonian - route '' , providing a systematic way to include further physical ingredients in a controlled expansion of the equations or , alternatively , to estimate errors in the existing approaches .    for context",
    ", we briefly review related work .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite developed a formalism similar to ours , focusing on fluid systems only ( i.e. without a black hole ) in the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) gauge , with leading - order dissipative effects , and conservative effects included at 1pn order ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an extension of this formalism to next - to - leading order in the dissipative sector ) .",
    "the numerical implementation of the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , achieved promising results , but found difficulties to produce sufficiently massive stars to describe neutron stars  @xcite . as we illustrate in this work , to deal with these difficulties higher - order approximations are required .",
    "an attempt in this direction was made by ref .",
    "@xcite , which performed a comprehensive study of the equations of pn hydrodynamics and radiation reaction ( for fluid systems only , i.e. in the absence of a black hole ) in the 3 + 1 formalism and with several gauge choices , through 2.5pn order .",
    "higher - order extensions are particularly easy to achieve in the harmonic gauge often used in pn calculations , but this gauge choice would yield a scheme involving hyperbolic equations with characteristics speeds given by the speed of light , already at low pn orders . such behavior is undesirable for studying mildly dynamical spacetimes whose true dynamics is governed by the characteristic speeds of the fluid describing the matter content . along these lines , a recently introduced formalism , partially related to ours ,",
    "is that of refs .",
    "@xcite , which essentially consists of solving the 1pn einstein equations with a conformally flat ansatz for the metric .",
    "while this approach indeed gets rid of characteristics with light - speed propagation , it only accounts for _ some _ effects at 1pn .",
    "a different approach to describe compact - object binaries is given by the effective - one - body formalism ( eob )  @xcite , which attempts to accelerate the convergence of the pn dynamics by `` resumming '' it ( both in the conservative  @xcite and dissipative  @xcite sectors ) .",
    "while very successful at describing binary black holes ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent comparison to full general - relativistic results ) and more recently neutron - star binaries  @xcite , the eob is not suitable for describing black holes interacting with matter that is not in a compact configuration .",
    "last , within the fully general relativistic regime a few options have been pursued to study related systems within reasonable computational efforts .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite a method to reduce the computational cost of implementing the full einstein equations coupled to matter has recently been introduced .",
    "this method allows one to treat black hole - star binary systems where the backreaction on the black hole is sufficiently small . in another approach , to study stellar black hole - white dwarf systems a suitable rescaling of the equation of state was introduced to study a related , though computationally tractable , problem and then extrapolate results to the problem of interest  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , focus has been placed in the interaction of white dwards with intermediate mass black holes so as to deal with comparable scales  @xcite . however , even in this regime simulations could only track the system for relatively short times .",
    "while keeping in mind these issues and options , we here develop an approach consisting of minimal modifications to newtonian theory .",
    "this has the advantage that existing ( thoroughly tested / highly sophisticated ) implementations of hydrodynamics ( for representative examples , see e.g.  @xcite ) in newtonian theory could be easily modified to implement our approach .",
    "alternatively , our approach can be used to evaluate the importance of the pn effects that are missing in newtonian simulations , and therefore gauge their errors relative to a fully general - relativistic treatment .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ secbasic ] describes our basic strategy for adapting the standard pn expansion to the purpose of describing a black hole interacting with a relativistic - fluid configuration . in sections [ sec1pn ] and [ sec2pn ] we present the derivations of the equations to first and second pn order .",
    "section [ sec2.5pn ] describes how gravitational waves are accounted for , and how their effect can be incorporated in the elliptic system determining the gravitational and fluid behavior . in section [ seckerrfluid ] we describe how to account for the black hole presence , while in section [ secmodels ] we present a discussion of implementation choices , together with a few examples .",
    "an analytic description of the two - body dynamics in general relativity , dating back originally to einstein s calculation of the perihelion of mercury  @xcite , is given by the pn approximation .",
    "the pn formalism is essentially an expansion in the ratio between the typical velocity of the system , @xmath4 , and the speed of light ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . for a fluid system",
    ", the dynamics is known through order @xmath5 beyond newtonian theory ( i.e. through 2.5pn order )  @xcite . for a binary system of non - spinning black holes",
    ", the conservative dynamics is known through 3pn order  @xcite , while the gravitational - wave fluxes have been computed through 3.5pn order @xcite ( i.e. through order @xmath6 beyond the quadrupole formula ) and 3pn order @xcite , respectively for a system of two non - spinning black holes on circular or eccentric orbits .",
    "the effect of the spins on the dynamics of compact - object ( and in particular black - hole ) binaries has also been calculated , both in the conservative and dissipative sectors  @xcite .",
    "one drawback of the pn expansion is that it is slowly convergent . as a result , the pn dynamics ,",
    "if extrapolated to @xmath7 , does not reproduce the correct general - relativistic dynamics accurately .",
    "this is particularly true for binary black - hole systems near coalescence .",
    "in fact , in order to obtain a sensible description of such systems in the strong field regime , the pn equations need to be `` resummed '' ( i.e. completed by `` educated guesses '' of the higher - order terms in @xmath8 , based on the known lower - order ones ) , both in the conservative  @xcite and dissipative  @xcite sectors .",
    "this resummation results in the so - called eob model , which was originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and which works not only for binary black holes  @xcite , but can also be adapted to more general compact - object binaries  @xcite .    seeking a reasonable compromise between the newtonian ( or pseudo - netwonian ) calculations commonly performed in astrophysics , and a fully general relativistic approach used in gravitational - wave physics",
    ", we therefore propose a formalism based on the pn dynamics through 2.5pn order ( i.e. 2pn order in the conservative sector , leading order in the dissipative sector ) .",
    "this generalizes the 1pn conservative , leading - order dissipative model of ref .",
    "@xcite , except that our model allows for the presence of a spinning black hole , besides the fluid ; while not fully resummed into an eob model , we `` resum '' at the least the energy and rest - mass conservation equations , as well as the euler equation , and show that this resummation significantly improves the behavior of our model .    at a practical level , and in order to obtain a model causally allowing for larger timesteps than those implied by a fully general - relativistic implementation , we seek a formalism in which the pn einstein equations neatly separate into a system of elliptic equations for `` gravitational potentials '' and hyperbolic evolution equations for the matter variables .",
    "( a formalism allowing for a similar decomposition has been obtained , at least partially , also in the fully general - relativistic case , where it is known as `` fully - constrained formulation '' of the einstein equations  @xcite ) .",
    "with such a decomposition , the elliptic equations will provide the generalization of the poisson equation for the newtonian potential , the equation for the frame - dragging potential , etc .    to achieve this separation , we draw inspiration from perturbation theory . consider a metric perturbation @xmath9 over a generic curved background metric @xmath10 , and introduce the trace - reversed perturbation @xmath11 in the lorenz gauge @xmath12 , the linearized einstein equations take the deceivingly simple form  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the background riemann , ricci and einstein tensors , and @xmath18 being the background levi - civita connection ) . the fluid s stress - energy tensor satisfies the linearized conservation equation , @xmath19 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in spite of its apparent simplicity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : box_h ] ) has all of the metric perturbations propagating at the speed of light , and would therefore share the same time - stepping constraint of the full general - relativistic treatment .",
    "a gauge that is better suited to our purposes , which include providing a formalism based on elliptic equations , is the so - called poisson gauge used in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "( note that this gauge can be chosen also at non - linear orders , see e.g. ref .",
    "focusing on perturbations over a flat background , we can write the most generic perturbed flat metric in cartesian coordinates @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) as to be @xmath23 . obviously , higher - order ( quadratic ) terms in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , etc will then show up in the field equations , because of the non - linear character of the einstein equations . ]",

    "instead , we adopt the poisson gauge , and show that it leads to pn equations that have a structure similar to eqs .",
    ". while the source terms of the pn equations will be rather involved ( although straightforward to implement ) , the elliptic equations - can be solved at arbitrary times and so the overall time - stepping criterion is determined by the speed of sound . as for the solution to the wave equation , we will show that at leading order it is given by the solution of another elliptic equation , with the addition of another contribution involving time derivatives of numerical integrals .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we start from the perturbed minkowski metric in the poisson gauge , given by eq .  .",

    "the einstein field equations are , as usual , @xmath43 or equivalently @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fluid s stress - energy tensor , and where we are setting @xmath46 ( as in the rest of this paper ) .",

    "the tt part of @xmath55 immediately gives @xmath56 which is hardly surprising because it simply amounts to the absence of gravitational waves at this order of approximation .",

    "from the equations derived in the previous section , one can obtain the leading - order dissipative contribution to the dynamics , i.e. the effect of gravitational - wave emission , which appears at 2.5pn order .",
    "more precisely , gravitational waves are encoded in the tt perturbation @xmath36 , which at linear order ( i.e. neglecting quadratic terms in the metric perturbations ) is known to satisfy the wave equation  @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the transverse projector . clearly , the 2pn version of this equation [ eq .  ] does not contain the second time derivative @xmath94 appearing in the `` box '' operator @xmath95 , because in the pn approximation time derivatives are suppressed by a factor @xmath61 relative to spatial derivatives .",
    "however , neglecting the time derivatives of quantities satisfying wave equations is subtle .",
    "for instance , when @xmath36 describes a gravitational wave with wavelength @xmath96 propagating in the direction @xmath97 at a distance @xmath98 from the source ( i.e. `` far '' from the source , in the so - called `` wave zone '' ) , time derivatives are @xmath99 . the extra factor @xmath100 therefore cancels the factor @xmath61 that accompanies time derivatives in the pn expansion , and one can not neglect time derivatives .",
    "although we will show how to obtain an approximate solution for @xmath36 in the wave zone at the end of this section [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , for the purposes of this work ( which aims at evolving fluid configurations in the presence of black holes ) it is actually more important to solve for @xmath36 inside / near the source ( i.e. in the `` near zone '' @xmath101 ) , because that is the regime that gives rise to the backreaction of gravitational waves on the source s dynamics .",
    "as we will now show , in the near zone the time derivatives ( i.e. the retardation effects due to the wave equation that @xmath36 satisfies ) will indeed cause the appearance of a 2.5pn dissipative radiation - reaction force .    reinstating the time derivatives of @xmath36 , eq .",
    "becomes   could contain terms depending on @xmath102 . however , those terms are actually of higher pn order , as one can check a posteriori from the decomposition of @xmath36 in a 2pn term and a 2.5pn term [ eq .  ] , which we will derive later in this section .",
    "] @xmath103 and recalling the retarded green function of the @xmath104 operator , @xmath105 which satisfies @xmath106 , one immediately gets @xmath107 if the source @xmath108 had a compact support ( i.e. if it vanished for @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is some finite radius ) , we could expand in orders of @xmath61 , and recalling that @xmath111 , write @xmath112 near or inside the support of @xmath113 ( i.e. , loosely speaking , `` near the source '' ) . at first sight , it would seem that @xmath113 does _ not _ have a compact support , as it involves for instance the potential @xmath24 , which decays as @xmath114 far from the source .",
    "however , because @xmath115 is the tt part of the metric perturbation , we can take the tt projection of eq .  , and obtain @xmath116 where we have introduced the potential @xmath117 which satisfies @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "we note that the only terms in @xmath113 that are not trivially zeroed - out by the tt projector @xmath119 are @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the latter terms can be rewritten , up to total derivatives ( which are zeroed - out by the tt projection ) , as @xmath122 , which in turn we can write as @xmath123+$ ] total derivatives .",
    "noting that the tt projection commutes with the @xmath104 operator , we can write @xmath124 where @xmath125 has now compact support . we can then expand @xmath126 because the 2pn term @xmath127 appearing in @xmath115 [ c.f .",

    ", we can write @xmath36 as the sum of the ( conservative ) 2pn contribution , and a dissipative 2.5pn contribution due to gravitational - wave emission : @xmath128 this additional term enters in the euler equation  , where it gives rise to a dissipative `` radiation - reaction '' force .",
    "an obvious problem with this is that @xmath115 enters eq .   through its derivatives ( and in particular its time derivatives ) , and according to eq .",
    "@xmath115 already depends on the time derivatives of the velocity .",
    "one therefore needs to reduce the number of time derivatives using either the equations of motion at newtonian order  @xcite or reduction of order techniques at the code level ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    to compute ,",
    "if so desired , the gravitational waveforms produced by the system , one can instead approximate eq .   far away from the source by replacing @xmath129 with the distance @xmath130 to the source and",
    "obtain @xmath131 with @xmath132 ( @xmath133 being the unit radial vector ) .",
    "in order to describe a system comprised of a fluid and a rotating black hole , we _ define _ @xmath134 where we denote with the index `` fluid '' the part of the perturbations that disappears in the limit in which @xmath38 and @xmath39 go to zero , while the index `` kerr '' denotes the part of the perturbations that makes up ( in the poisson gauge ) the kerr metric , which describes an isolated rotating black hole .",
    "we stress that these equations do _ not _ amount to assuming any sort of superposition between an isolated kerr black hole and the fluid perturbations , as the `` fluid '' part will too depend on the presence of the black hole ( and in particular , on its mass and spin ) . for simplicity ,",

    ", the interaction between the fluid and the black hole will be accounted for by suitable terms sourcing the gravitational potentials .",
    "this reference frame can be identified by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the fluid potentials , i.e. by requiring that the fluid exerts neither a force nor a torque on the black hole , so that the black hole neither moves nor its spin precesses .",
    "note that this does not mean that the fluid ",
    "black hole interaction is not accounted for .",
    "it simply amounts  at a newtonian level  to adopting a reference frame comoving with the black hole and whose axes follow the precession of the black - hole spin .",

    "might then conclude that in order to achieve the desired conditions , we should impose @xmath154 ( with @xmath155 given by eq .  ) and @xmath156 at the black hole s position , so that the fluid - generated metric near the black hole matches eq .  .",
    "these boundary conditions would be , however , overly restrictive . for instance , one can rewrite eq .   in a different coordinate system , by rescaling the time and by rotating and rescaling the spatial axes . when one does so , it is easy to get convinced that a more generic set of boundary conditions under which the black hole does not move nor its spin precesses is given by @xmath157 and @xmath158 at the black hole s position , with no conditions on the values of the fluid - generated metric perturbations at the black hole , except that they be constant in time ( because all the time derivarives of the metric perturbations at the black hole s location vanish ) .",

    "the existence of an isco has profound astrophysical implications .",

    "we thus calculate the gauge - invariant isco radius @xmath207 , defined in terms of the isco orbital frequency @xmath208 .",
    "this measure of the isco radius is to be preferred to coordinate radii because it does not depend on the coordinate system and is thus free of ambiguities ( for instance , while the coordinate location of the isco in the pv potential is correct in a particular coordinate system , the associated isco frequency is incorrect ) . to calculate the isco frequency",
    "we take the kerr metric in adm coordinates , as given in sec .",
    "[ seckerrfluid ] , truncate it at the appropriate ( 1.5pn or 2.5pn ) order , and utilize it in the euler equations ( with the pressure set to zero ) , either taylor expanded at the appropriate ( 1.5pn or 2.5pn ) order , or in their `` resummed '' form  .",
    "( of course , the euler equation reduces to the geodesic equation when @xmath209 ) .",
    "the isco location is then obtained by studying the stability of circular orbits under radial perturbations . because circular orbits are assumed to have @xmath210 ( i.e. to move in the positive @xmath24-direction ) , negative values of the spin - parameter projection @xmath211 denote configurations in which the orbit s angular momentum and the black - hole spin are anti - aligned .",
    "as can be seen , the `` 1.5pnc+taylor eom '' and `` 1.5pnc+resummed eom '' models do not perform well , because they are far from the general - relativistic result , and for @xmath212 they do not seem to present an isco at all .",
    "better results are achieved by the `` 2.5pnc+taylor eom '' and `` 2.5pnc+resummed eom '' models , which present an isco over the whole spin range @xmath213 $ ] .",
    "we stress that spin - effects ( `` frame - dragging '' ) are completely absent for the pv potential , whose expression @xmath214 has no spin dependence .",
    "nevertheless , it is rather clear that none of our pn schemes can reproduce the exact general - relativistic result at high spins @xmath215 . while this behavior is clearly unsatisfactory , it is common to essentially all approximation schemes based on pn theory ( even if the pn dynamics is resummed into an eob model , cf .",
    "e.g. ref .",
    "this is because pn theory necessarily fails when @xmath216 , since in the extremal limit the kerr isco coincides with a null generator of the horizon  @xcite , where the pn expansion breaks down as @xmath7 , i.e. all terms in the pn expansion would be needed to obtain an accurate determination of the isco location . in our case",
    ", we recall that we are forced by our initial choice of using the poisson gauge to use the kerr metric in adm coordinates , which is only known through 3pn order  @xcite .",
    "( as mentioned earlier , the choice of the poisson gauge is dictated by the need to minimize the number of propagating degrees of freedom satisfying hyperbolic equations . ) the explicit form of the 3pn kerr metric in adm coordinates is given by eqs .",
    " , and we have attempted to use that form in the unexpanded ( `` resummed '' ) geodesic equation @xmath217 to calculate the isco . the result is shown in fig .  [",
    "figure_isco ] as `` 3pnc+resummed eom '' . as can be seen , at high spins that curve still falls short of reproducing the exact kerr isco , confirming that a precise determination of this quantity would require many more pn orders than currently available .",
    "in this work we have presented a pn formulation of the equations of motion for a black hole interacting with a fluid configuration ( e.g.  a star ) .",
    "our approach can in principle be implemented in existing newtonian codes to account for currently missing effects appearing at different pn orders ( e.g. frame dragging , black - hole spins , radiation reaction , etc . ) . alternatively , it provides for a way to estimate the errors intrinsic to newtonian approaches because of their neglecting of pn effects . as illustrated in fig . 1 and 2 , our approach is approximate , but its performance improves as higher pn orders are considered ( especially for black - hole spin parameters @xmath218 ) .",
