    "the ` extremely red galaxies ' ( ergs , also known as eros ) are a population of faint and distant galaxies , appearing in large numbers faintward of @xmath17 , with very red optical / near - infrared colours ( @xmath18 or @xmath0 ) , corresponding to galaxies which are already old and passively evolving at @xmath19 .",
    "the ergs are of great importance in understanding galaxy evolution , in particular they represent an evolutionary link between the rapidly star - forming galaxies detected by scuba at @xmath20 , and present - day massive e / s0 galaxies .",
    "a key property of ergs is their strong clustering , as revealed by measurements of their angular correlation function , @xmath21 ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "2000 ; firth et al . 2002",
    "; roche et al . 2002 ; roche , dunlop and almaini 2003 ) . assuming a comoving model of clustering evolution ,",
    "these observations give for ergs a correlation radius @xmath22@xmath23 mpc ( where @xmath24 @xmath25 ) , which supports their interpretation as the progenitors of giant ellipticals .",
    "however , ergs are actually a very diverse population of galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic observations find that some are indeed old , passive galaxies at @xmath19 ( e.g. dunlop 1996 ) ; however , at least half of the ergs show emission lines ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; yan et al .",
    "2004a ) indicating ongoing star formation .",
    "radio , x - ray ( daddi et al . 2004 ) and mid - ir ( yan et al . 2004b ) observations indicate that many emission - line ergs are actually undergoing major starbursts , with star - formation rates ( sfrs ) as high as @xmath26100 @xmath27 .",
    "secondly , deep x - ray surveys reveal at least @xmath28 per cent of ergs to host obscured agn ( alexander et al .",
    "2002 ; roche et al . 2003 ) .",
    "thirdly , ergs are morphologically diverse ; a mixture of bulges , disks , irregulars and mergers ( e.g. yan and thompson 2003 ; cimatti et al . 2003 ) .    initially we ( roche et al .",
    "2002 ) colour - selected a sample of 158 ergs with @xmath29 on the elais n2 field .",
    "we found evidence of strong clustering and a mixture of morphologies , and identified 7 ergs as radio sources ( either agn or powerful starbursts ) .",
    "we also fitted the erg number counts with a model in which they evolve into the present - day e / s0 population , through a combination of passive luminosity evolution , merging , and a gradual increase with time in the comoving number density of red galaxies .    for our second study ( roche , dunlop and almaini 2003 , hereafter rda03 ) , deeper optical ( hst - acs ) and near - ir ( vlt - isaac ) data enabled us to colour - select 198 ergs to a fainter limit of @xmath30 , on a central region of the chandra / goods deep field south .",
    "for the clustering of these ergs we estimated @xmath31 mpc , and we identified 17 ergs with x - ray sources in the 1-msec chandra survey ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) , from the x - ray fluxes diagnosing 13 as obscured agn and the other 4 as probable starbursts .    in our third study , caputi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) fitted template spectra to the 7-band optical / near - ir photometry of these same ergs to derive photometric redshift estimates , which in turn were used to estimate stellar masses and luminosity functions .",
    "caputi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) then extended this analysis to the full sample of @xmath32 galaxies on this field ( see section 6 ) .    in this paper",
    "we further investigate the cdfs ergs by means of a deep optical spectroscopic survey , with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) .",
    "we aim to measure redshifts and emission lines for a sample of ergs to a limit @xmath3321 , and furthermore to estimate the ages of these galaxies by fitting evolving models to their spectra and broad - band fluxes ( including new 3.6/4.5 @xmath34 fluxes from spitzer ) .",

    "these @xmath47 galaxies were positionally matched to the corresponding detections on the isaac @xmath40 and @xmath41 mosaics and the acs @xmath49 images .",
    "colours were measured for each as the differences in the 2.0 arcsec aperture magnitudes , and the erg sample was then selected as the @xmath50 galaxies redder than @xmath51 , which numbered 198 in the 50.4 @xmath43 area .",
    "we numbered these objects 1 to 2555 using their order of detection in the @xmath52 catalog .",
    "for the galaxies studied in this paper we also measure 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath34 fluxes from the spitzer ` epoch 2 ' data release of may 2005 .",
    "the spitzer data has a lower resolution of @xmath53 arcsec . because of this",
    ", larger apertures of 2.8 arcsec diameter were employed to measure the spitzer fluxes , and to these fluxes aperture corrections of 0.5 mag for @xmath54 and 0.55 mag for @xmath55 were applied , as derived from the point - spread function .",
    "the target galaxies for our gmos survey form a subset of the rda03 sample , consisting primarily of the brighter , @xmath56 , ergs within a @xmath57 arcmin area that can be covered by a single gmos mask .",
    "a spectrograph mask was prepared with 47 slitlets ( each of length 2.0 arcsec and width 1.0 arcsec ) devoted to our target ergs .",
    "figure 1 shows their positions within the larger area of our cdfs sample .",
    "observations were performed with gmos on the gemini south telescope in chile , over the period from 24 september 2003 to 21 february 2004 , using the low - dispersion , r150 grating and central wavelengths in the region of @xmath58 . in total",
    "we were able to obtain 70 exposures , totalling 35.5 hours , through the erg slit mask .",
    "these science observations were interspersed with cuar arc lamp and standard star exposures , for wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "these observations utilized gmos in the the ` nod - and - shuffle ' mode described in detail by abraham et al .",
    "the sky background is a serious problem for ground - based spectroscopy , especially at redder , @xmath59 , wavelengths where there are strong emission lines .",
    "the ` nod - and - shuffle ' mode was designed to provide improved subtraction of the sky background , even where this is subject to considerable spatial and time variation . essentially , the telescope is ` nodded ' ( by 1 arcsec in this case ) along the spectroscopic slit , observing at each position alternately in a rapid one - minute cycle . in position",
    "a the object will be towards one side of the slit and the adjacent sky on the other , in position b the object will be on the other side . with each cycle , the charges stored on the ccd from the two positions are ` shuffled ' ( by 2 arcsec ) into adjacent strips on the ccd frame , where they are accumulated over the course of each half - hour exposure . in this way the sky is observed simultaneously with , and as close as possible in position to , each individual target galaxy .",
    "gmos data reduction was carried out using iraf routines , including some specifically written for this instrument .",
    "firstly , bias frames were subtracted from the target galaxy , arc - lamp and standard star exposures .",
    "the next step was sky subtraction , performed individually for each of the 70 exposures .",
    "the nod - and - shuffle mode produces a ccd frame showing two adjacent strips for each spectrograph slit , corresponding to the two nod positions . to sky",
    "subtract , the frame is shifted by the shuffle step and subtracted it from itself ( using the iraf ` gnsskysub ' task ) . this produces a positive and a negative sky - subtracted spectrum for each target galaxy .",
    "small dithers in the spectral and spatial directions between the 70 exposures ( introduced intentionally for the removal of charge traps ; abraham et al .",
    "2004 ) were removed by registering the 70 exposures in both axes .",
    "the 70 sky - subtracted frames could then be combined , using iraf ` imcombine ' with a ` sigclip ' rejection to remove most of the cosmic rays , into a single 35.5 hour image , from which we extract the spectra .",
    "iraf tasks ( e.g. ` apall ' ) were then employed to extract the 2d spectra from each slit , summing each in the spatial direction to give a 1d spectrum . with nod and",
    "shuffle it is necessary to extract both the positive and a negative spectrum for each object , and then subtract one from the other .    the galaxy spectra were wavelength calibrated using the cuar lamp calibration spectrum as observed through the same slit of the mask .",
    "each pixel is approximately @xmath60 and the resolution of our spectra @xmath61 flux calibration was performed using a co - added spectrum of the calibration standard star ltt1020 , and the spectral energy distribution of this star as tabulated by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , to derive ( using iraf ` sensfunc ' ) a sensitivity function for the spectrograph ( fig 2a ) .",
    "corrections were also applied to the spectra for the telluric ( earth s atmosphere ) absorption bands , using our calibration spectrum of a white - dwarf standard star ( these having few intrinsic spectral features ) , eg131 .",
    "this was divided by a fit to its own continuum , giving a function almost flat at unity except for four telluric absorption bands , centred at 6560 , 6875 , 7610 and @xmath62 .",
    "these were extracted , converted into magnitude units , and inserted into a function @xmath63 to give a telluric correction function .",
    "the erg spectra were divided by this correction function and by the sensitivity function , to give spectra calibrated in @xmath64 ( in units of @xmath65 ergs @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 ( in units @xmath69 ergs @xmath70 ) , ready for further analysis .",
    "on examining the gmos spectra we found that our survey had a good rate of success for ergs to @xmath71 , but failed to reach the fainter @xmath72 limit of the target list . of our 47 spectra of erg targets , 16 were galaxy spectra of sufficient quality that we were able to determine good or , at least , likely redshifts .",
    "17 showed no significant signal , 13 had some signal in the continuum but we were unable to confidently identify any spectral features above the noise , and one was identified as a red galactic star .",
    "the 16 ` successful ' spectra include 13 of the 18 target ergs with @xmath73 , 3 of the 6 target ergs with @xmath74 but none fainter than this .",
    "redshifts were estimated by a combination of ( i ) fitting models to the continuum , by the method described below , ( ii ) identifying absorption features , and ( iii ) from emission lines such as [ oii ] @xmath75 , where present . for galaxies with an emission line we determine both an emission ( @xmath76 ) and a continnum - fit / absorption - line ( @xmath77 ) redshift .",
    "in all cases we found the two consistent within the @xmath78 statistical error on @xmath77 .",
    "where both are given @xmath76 is likely to be more precise .",
    "two of these redshifts , for the galaxies 1843 and 1158 , are based on spectral features of poor signal - to - noise and must be regarded as less reliable than the other 14",
    ". however these two redshifts are supported by very good fits of our model spectra to the 7-band photometry .",
    "we therefore define a redshift sample comprised of these 16 ergs .",
    "the 16 redshifts range from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , with 6 in a ` spike ' at @xmath81 , which may be indicative of large - scale structure .",

    "three ergs lie at @xmath5 where [ oii ] would not be visible in our wavelength range , but two of these have [ oii ] visible at the red extreme of the fors2 spectra ( which have a slightly redder limit ) , and all three have strong fluxes at the blue end .",

    "there are two ways in which we can estimate a very approximate dust - corrected sfr .",

    "this will correct for dust , as this is taken into account in calculating @xmath127 , but for an individual erg this is very approximate due to the large error bars on @xmath115 . for the full sample of ergs",

    "extrapolated to lower redshifts , this model would overpredict the clustering of local passive galaxies of all luminosities , @xmath168 mpc ( madgwick et al . 2003 ) , but be consistent with the clustering of the most luminous ( @xmath169 ) early - types at @xmath170 , @xmath171 mpc comoving ( brown et al .",
    "2003 ) . this can be explained if ( i ) many of the @xmath19 ergs undergo further merging to become very massive ellipticals , ( ii ) only some ( @xmath172 half ) of the moderate - luminosity e / s0s found locally have evolved directly from @xmath19 ergs and the others are formed at @xmath173 from mergers of less strongly clustered spirals , thus diluting the clustering .    to better understand the evolution of ergs it will be useful to compare their clustering with that of their their likely progenitors at higher redshifts , such as sub - mm galaxies , for which the clustering will be measured in the ongoing shades survey .",
    "there is already evidence that the most massive lyman break galaxies at @xmath174 have a similar comoving @xmath175 ( @xmath176 mpc ) to the @xmath1772 ergs ( allen et al .",

    "figure 9 plots stellar age @xmath114 against spectroscopic redshift for all these samples , with loci of the redshifts corresponding to time @xmath114 before observation .    for the first four samples the mean stellar ages of ergs",
    "at all @xmath185 are spread over the range between @xmath13 and shortly ( a few @xmath186 yr ) before the epoch of observation .",
    "they seem to divide into two groups with @xmath187 and @xmath1884 .    the longhetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample of very luminous ergs differs from the others in that it seems to be concentrated towards higher formation redshifts  it contains 5 galaxies with @xmath189 .",
    "these have stellar masses 3.8@xmath190 , more than twice the mass of any erg in our sample .",
    "hence their ages may be evidence that the very most massive spheroidals formed significantly earlier and/or formed their stars most quickly , as in the model of granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "it is also notable that the formation redshifts appear to trace the plotted @xmath128 loci .",
    "the ages of the oldest galaxies at each redshift , as a function of redshift , is an important tracer of the expansion of the universe and hence the cosmological model ( e.g. jimenez and loeb 2002 ) .",
    "we would expect @xmath128 for the oldest galaxies to be constant with observed redshift , and the agreement with the plotted loci would support a @xmath191 cosmological constant ( @xmath192 ) model .    as @xmath114 represents",
    "a flux - weighted mean stellar age , the true age of a galaxy since formation must always be greater , to a degree dependent on the detailed form of the star - formation history .",
    "one interpretation may therefore be that most or all of the red galaxies observed as ergs at @xmath1932 are galaxies , or mergers of galaxies , which formed at @xmath1945 , and that the spread in their stellar ages up to this maximum redshift can be attributed to differences in their individual evolution , i.e. the mergers and starbursts they have experienced .",
    "caputi et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) , using photometric redshift estimates derived from seven - band photometry of ergs and other @xmath32 galaxies in this field , found the comoving number density of massive ( @xmath195 ) galaxies in a full @xmath132-selected sample to fall only slowly from @xmath196 to @xmath197 , where a significant fraction , 2025 per cent , of today s massive galaxies were already in place .",
    "however , the comoving number density of the reddest subset of these galaxies , the ergs , evolves much more rapidly , steadily increasing with time from @xmath197 to @xmath193 , and following a trend which extrapolates to the present - day e / so population at @xmath198 . at @xmath1931.5 , the rising comoving number density of ergs approached that of all @xmath132-selected galaxies at the higher redshift of @xmath199 .",
    "hence , this suggests that a substantial population of massive galaxies formed at @xmath194 and were initially starbursting and relatively blue , but with increasing age many became red enough to be classed as ergs .",
    "interestingly , for the brightest ( @xmath200 ) lyman break galaxies at @xmath174 , allen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measure strong clustering of @xmath201 mpc comoving , consistent with these evolving into the ergs at @xmath1932 .    to produce the evolution in erg number density",
    "these galaxies must have entered the erg class over a wide redshift range @xmath202 , again implying much variation in their star - formation histories .",
    "the formation of so many massive galaxies at @xmath194 places significant constraints on models of galaxy formation ( e.g. fontana et al .",
    "2004 ) and may favour models with feedback between the star - formation in formative spheroidals and the growth of supermassive black holes within them ( granato et al . 2004 ; silva et al . 2005 ) .",
    "yan et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and doherty et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , found that @xmath203 per cent of erg spectra have prominent absorption features and @xmath204 breaks , while @xmath205 per cent also show some [ oii ] emission .",
    "we find the same for our slightly deeper sample . for only 3 ergs",
    "do we find neither [ oii ] emission nor any indication of a young stellar population from a blue excess in the sed .",
    "this is consistent with the doherty et al .",

    "( 2004a ) and the 1.1 @xmath27 of the doherty et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ergs .",
    "of course the true sfrs of the emission - line ergs will be higher .",
    "on the basis of the dust extinction estimated from our model fits , we estimate the real mean sfr will be about 1224 @xmath27 .",
    "this may still be an underestimate as emission line regions of current sf may suffer more extinction than the continuum produced by sf over a longer period .",
    "spitzer mid - ir observations ( yan et al .",
    "2004b ) of ergs similarly selected to those in our sample indicate that about half have @xmath212 , and for these the mean sfr @xmath213 .",
    "we should be able to obtain genuinely dust - independent measurements of the sfrs for the individual ergs in the goods - s from the deep spitzer @xmath214 survey of this field scheduled for later this year .",
    "examining the hst - acs images of ergs we find ergs to be a mixture of spheroidals , spirals and merging systems .",
    "the classifications by eye are confirmed by sersic model fits to the radial profiles ( table 5 ) .",
    "we discuss the nature and sf activity of the ergs within each of these morphological categories .      we class 7 ergs , almost half the sample , as spheroidals .",
    "spectroscopically they are varied , and this may be related to whether or not they have recently undergone a merger event or the accretion of a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "one spheroidal ( 2401 ) appears to be old and purely passive , with no evidence of sf in the last 2.5 gyr .",
    "another ( 1955 ) shows no [ oii ] emission but its near - ir colours suggest it may be a dust - reddened post - starburst galaxy .",
    "one of the spheroidal ergs hosts an obscured agn , it may also be star - forming .",
    "one is old with a young , dusty starburst ( 1143 ) .",
    "the final three ( 2246 , 1152 , 1029 ) are relatively young ( 12 gyr ) with the model fits suggesting prolonged , low - level , non - dusty sf ; and appear to show post - merging features .      of these 16 ergs",
    "5 are obvious mergers , with multiple nuclei , and all of these are star - forming galaxies , on the basis of [ oii ] emission .",
    "the two @xmath5 mergers also have a high surface brightness ( figure 6 ) .",
    "presumably the sfrs and dust content are both increased by the interactions .",
    "some appear to be mixed mergers of passive spheroidals with bluer irregulars ( e.g. 1565 and 1823 ) , and one ( 1762 ) has prominent tidal tails . on the basis of our model fits , four of the 5 mergers are relatively young ( 0.62.0 gyr ) and undergoing short - term ( 1040 myr ) dusty starbursts .",
    "notably , in our sample ; 4 of the 5 galaxies with @xmath215 myr are mergers ( the other is an agn ) .",
    "this would be expected from the current interaction acting to tidally trigger an intense but short - term starburst .",
    "the fifth merger , a close irregular / spheroidal pair , ( 1823 ) differs in that it is @xmath216 gyr old with a long @xmath115 and balmer absorption .",
    "this may be explained if it is a late - stage merger where most starbursting occurred at earlier encounters of the two galaxies , and the elliptical is already very old .",
    "perhaps a more surprising discovery is that of a third morphological class of ergs which are neither ellipticals nor mergers , but red spirals .",
    "we find four of these .",
    "one explanation for the red colours of these galaxies is that they are very dusty , the erg colour criterion selecting out the spirals at the very top end of the range of internal dust extinctions , the other is that they long ago ceased forming stars . according to our model , the four spirals differ widely in age ( 1.03.5 gyr ) but in all cases contain a young component with a long @xmath115 ( 200800 myr ) and heavy dust extinction ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "three show [ oii ] emission , the fourth ( 1777 ) may therefore have ceased forming stars .",
    "strong balmer lines are seen in two of the spirals , 1412 and 1876 , and this reinforces the evidence from model fits that spiral ergs tend to contain large intermediate - age ( 0.11.0 gyr ) populations .",
    "it is also notable that spiral 1876 has a luminous red ( passive ? ) nucleus ringed by blue star - forming regions , producing a strong colour gradient . indeed , for 3 of the spiral ergs",
    ", a comparison of the @xmath217 and @xmath118 images shows that ( in contrast to the merging ergs ) , their star - formation is not predominantly nuclear but in the outer disks .",
    "the @xmath218 erg # 4950 of daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , classed as type sa , also has a red nucleus with a blue outer ring .",
    "the existence and spectral properties of very red spirals can be explained if they are galaxies with continuous star - formation which has been gradually slowed or completely truncated .",
    "this explains the long @xmath115 , balmer absorption , and the absence of emission lines in one spiral ( already truncated ? ) .",
    "in addition to this , they are very dusty , as the erg colour criterion would select out the spirals at the very top end of the wide range of internal dust extinctions .    very red spiral galaxies also occur at lower redshifts , where they make up some 0.3 per cent of all galaxies ( yamauchi and goto 2004 ) , and tend to be found in the outer regions of clusters ( couch et al . 2002 ; goto et al . 2003 ) . in the model of bekki ,",
    "couch and shioya ( 2002 ) a spiral galaxy , infalling into a cluster , experiences a truncation of star - formation activity , as its gas content is removed through ram - pressure stripping by the intra - cluster medium and/or by cluster tidal fields . following this",
    "the galaxy would become very red in @xmath219 gyr but could retain a spiral appearence , with visible arms , for @xmath220 gyr , although would ultimately evolve into an s0 type .",
    "this mechanism could give rise to red spirals at erg redshifts , as both spiral galaxies ( dawson et al . 2003 ) and large erg - rich clusters ( e.g. kurk et al .",
    "2004 ) are already in place at @xmath221 .",
    "however , some spiral ergs e.g. 1876 , must be in relatively early stages of this process as much sf is still ongoing in their outer regions .    more information on the nature of spiral ergs and the relative importance of dust and",
    "` truncation ' will soon be available from spitzer @xmath222 data , giving a dust - independent sfr , and spectroscopy at 1@xmath223 , showing balmer lines and @xmath224 .",
    "it is likely that some sort of environmental effect is involved because ergs in general are very much more clustered than typical spirals .",
    "ongoing surveys of the cdfs with the spitzer infra - red telescope will , when complete , provide accurate , dust - independent measurements of the sfrs in our redshift sample .",
    "the ongoing shades survey of bright , @xmath225 , sub - mm galaxies will provide a measurement of the clustering of these probable progenitors of the ergs ( dunlop 2005 ; mortier et al .",
    "we have planned further and more extensive spectroscopic surveys , including in the near - ir , of high redshift galaxy clusters and large - scale structure .",
