    "the very existence of a massive cluster at z @xmath0 0.5 is problematic for standard cdm theories of hierarchical structure formation ( evrard 1989 ; peebles 1989 ) .",
    "while this problem has been recognized for some time , it has not been taken too seriously because of the lack of conclusive evidence of the existence of such massive systems at high redshift .",
    "naturally the statistics on the abundance of high z clusters are poor because the number of such clusters known at present is small .",
    "furthermore , one might argue that many of these clusters may not be as massive as they appear due to inflation of the measured velocity dispersion from field galaxy contamination and projection effects ( see among others frenk 1990 ) .",
    "however , the number of distant clusters is steadily increasing due to the combined use of telescopes such as hst ( hubble space telescope ) and keck , as we have heard from many contributors at this meeting .",
    "x - ray observations of distant ( z @xmath0 0.7 ) optically selected clusters have shown that only a few clusters are detected ( see among others castander 1994 ) , and those few are relatively modest x - ray emitters ( l@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) , with l@xmath4 much lower than that of present day clusters . while this fact would seem to imply that extremely rich systems with large amounts of x - ray emitting gas do not exist at these high redshifts , i will show several examples that indicate that this is not the case . in table 1 , five examples of emss ( einstein medium sensitivity survey ; gioia 1990 , stocke 1991 ) clusters with average z = 0.66 , and z@xmath5 = 0.826 are listed .",
    "in addition to their high x - ray luminosity , there is other compelling evidence that these clusters are genuinely massive .",
    "three of the z@xmath60.6 - 0.7 clusters contain large lensed arcs which allow a crude estimate of the projected mass in the cluster cores . for four of them",
    "weak lensing studies have been performed .",
    "the letter `` s '' in the third column of table 1 indicates the presence of giant arcs in the cluster core , while the letter `` w '' indicates that weak lensing analyses have been performed .",
    "l@xmath4 is given in units of 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.3@xmath83.5 kev band , t@xmath4 is measured in the 2@xmath810 kev band and n@xmath9 is the central richness of the cluster ( defined in bahcall 1981 ; notice that in the same units coma has n@xmath9=28 ) .",
    ".emss clusters with z @xmath0 0.5 [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , < , < \" , ]",
    "since its discovery ms0015.9@xmath116 ( alias cl0016@xmath116 , koo 1981 ) has been the archetypal rich , x - ray luminous , distant cluster .",
    "it is part of the emss since it was `` rediscovered '' in an observation pointed at another target .",
    "the cluster is very rich and has a linear structure elongated in the ne - sw direction .",
    "smail ( 1994 ) reported detection of weak shear , which has been reconfirmed by the analysis performed by luppino ( 1996 ) using different deep images with a larger field of view and a different technique ( kaiser and squires , 1993 ; squires and kaiser , 1996 ) .",
    "two hours of r band keck data are in hand but the images have not been assembled yet ( clowe , private communication ) .",
    "ms0451@xmath803 with an l@xmath4 of almost 2@xmath1010@xmath11erg s@xmath3 is the most x - ray luminous cluster in the emss and among the brightest clusters known .",
    "asca data by donahue ( 1996 ) show a hot cluster at 10.4 kev with iron abundance of 15% solar and a total mass ( within 1h@xmath12mpc ) of 9.7@xmath13 m. the shear signal detection , performed by luppino ( 1996 ) on a 7200s r band image taken with the uh 2.2 m telescope is at @xmath05@xmath14 .",
    "two hours of r band keck data are in hand also for this cluster but the analysis has not been performed yet .",
    "ms1054@xmath803 is the most distant cluster of the emss and among the most distant x - ray selected clusters known .",
    "the cluster has a filamentary morphology with the x - ray coming from the center and elongated in the same e@xmath8w direction as the optical galaxies ( donahue 1997 ) .",
    "ms1054@xmath803 is extremely rich and quite hot at 14.7@xmath15 kev as obtained by asca ( donahue 1997 ) .",
    "a strong shear signal at 6@xmath14 level is detected ( luppino & kaiser , 1997 ) .",
    "the total mass ( within 1 mpc ) from x - rays and from weak lensing are consistent ( 2 - 6@xmath16 mvs 3 - 30@xmath16 m ) .",
    "deep imaging of ms1137@xmath166 with keck and with the uh 2.2 m have been collected . from the reduced images a large arc has been discovered close to the cluster center ( clowe 1997 ) .",
    "differently from ms1054@xmath803 and ms0015.9 @xmath116 this cluster is compact and concentrated with no filamentary structure . a weak lensing analysis , performed by clowe on a 8700 second r - band exposure of keck , using the i band ( 7500 s ) 2.2 m data as a color selection to remove cluster galaxies , finds a nice centrally concentrated mass peak falling exactly on the brightest cluster galaxy . the mass from weak lensing comes out to be 2.9@xmath17 m at 500 @xmath18 kpc ( assuming the background galaxies lie at z=2 ) .",
    "also for ms2053 - 04 two hours of r band keck data are in hand but the images have not been assembled .",
    "a recent observation of this cluster has been performed with the italian - dutch bepposax satellite by scaramella ( in preparation ) .",
    "the data have not been fully reduced yet .",
    "a preliminary analysis shows this cluster to be much cooler than ms1054@xmath803 or ms0451@xmath803 .",
    "the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) region of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; trmper 1991 ) has the largest exposure time ( approaching 10 ks ) of the all rass .",
    "the nep region covers a 9@xmath19 field , and contains a total of 465 x - ray sources detected at @xmath0 4@xmath14 in the 0.1@xmath82.4 kev ( mullis 1998 ) .",
    "we are identifying all sources in the field .",
    "the principal derivative is a statistically complete sample of galaxy clusters appropriate for a better characterization of the x - ray luminosity function evolution .",
    "we have discovered a very distant cluster in the nep at z= 0.81 .",
    "rxj1716@xmath166 ( henry 1997 ) is among the most distant x - ray selected clusters together with ms1054@xmath803 and the x - ray clusters detected by rosati ( 1997 ) in the rdcs ( rosat deep cluster survey ) or ebeling ( 1997 ) in the warps ( wide angle rosat pointed survey ) .      as with ms1054@xmath803",
    ", it is not likely that rxj1716@xmath166 is in virial equilibrium .",
    "the galaxies in rxj1716@xmath166 are in an inverted s - shaped filament running northeast to southwest ( fig .",
    "cluster members extend all along the s. the distance from the top to the bottom of the s is about 1.5 mpc ( h@xmath2050 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , q@xmath21=0.5 ) .",
    "x - ray follow - up observations with asca ( 100 ks ) and with the rosat hri ( 171 ks ) provide a temperature in 2@xmath810 kev of kt = 6.7 @xmath22 ( 68% confidence ) and a flux in 0.5@xmath82.0 kev of 1.16@xmath230.33 @xmath10 10@xmath24 erg @xmath25s@xmath3 .",
    "it is intriguing that the morphology of rxj1716@xmath166 and ms1054@xmath803 is filamentary with the x - rays coming from the center .",
    "we note this since the initial formation of protoclusters is often described as matter flowing along filaments ( bond 1996 ) with the x - rays generated at the impact point of the two colliding streams of matter ( henry 1997 ) .",

    "north is up and east to the left .",
    "this image spans 3.6@xmath103.6 ( 0.9h@xmath3 mpc at @xmath260.81 ) at a scale of 0.21/pixel .",
    "both cfht 8k@xmath108k mosaic ccd deep images and keck r - band ( 7500s ) images were taken .",
    "the weak lensing analysis was performed on the r - band keck image , using 2.2 m i - band data ( 26,100s ) for color terms ( clowe 1997 ) .",
    "the mass peak is just east of the bcg , and an arm of mass to the ne , neatly following the line of galaxies ne of the cluster core is detected .",
    "doug clowe analysis gives a very strong signal of 4@xmath27 m(background galaxies at z=1.5 ) .",
    "the m / l@xmath28 is equal to 210@xmath29 .",
    "both the optical lightmap and weak lensing massmap have two spatially distinct massive sub - clusters , as well as a long filamentary structure .",
    "there is clear evidence from the existing data that large , dense mass concentrations existed at an early epoch .",
    "another possible search strategy to find distant x - ray clusters is to look for clusters around powerful radio galaxies .",
    "high z massive structures have been found around several 3c radio galaxies ( i.e. : 3c184 , at z@xmath300.99 , deltorn 1997 ; 3c324 , at z@xmath301.2 , smail & dickinson , 1995 , just to quote a few ) .",
    "cluster abundances has been cited as one of the strongest evidence against the standard cdm model as normalized to reproduce the microwave background anisotropies seen by cobe satellite .",
    "the number of high - z massive clusters predicted by standard cdm , or other mixed dark matter models , is too low with respect to the number of clusters observed . in low - density universes",
    "there is less evolution and nearly all 10@xmath31 mclusters formed by z@xmath300.5 . in a high - density universe , instead",
    ", only 5% of the present day 10@xmath31 mclusters have formed by the same redshift .",
    "thus massive clusters should be much rarer at epochs earlier than 0.5 if @xmath32=1 , contrary to the observations .",
    "alternatives have been suggested with low @xmath32 models ( viana & liddle , 1996 ; eke 1996 ) .",
    "the open cdm ( @xmath32=0.3 ) and @xmath33-dominated cdm models are preferred because they are compatible with the data .",
    "it may be possible to estimate @xmath32 from forthcoming observations of intermediate - distant clusters ( up to z@xmath61 ) .",
