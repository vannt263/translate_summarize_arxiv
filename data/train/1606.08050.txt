    "while advances in two - dimensional ( 2d ) percolation have recently allowed to determine the site percolation threshold on the square lattice with an astonishing accuracy of 14 significant digits @xcite and many critical exponents in 2d have been known exactly for decades @xcite , the progress in higher dimensions is far slower .",
    "the main reason for this is that the two theoretical concepts that proved particularly fruitful in percolation theory , conformal field theory and duality , are useful only in 2d systems , and the thresholds in higher dimensions are known only from simulations .",
    "the site and bond percolation thresholds in dimensions @xmath5 are known with accuracy of at least 6 significant digits @xcite , but for more complicated lattices , e.g. fcc , bcc or diamond lattices @xcite , complex neighborhoods @xcite , or continuum percolation models @xcite this accuracy is often far from satisfactory . moreover , even though the upper critical dimension is known to be @xmath6 @xcite , numerical estimates of the critical exponents for @xmath7 are still rather poor .",
    "continuous percolation of aligned objects can be regarded as a limit of a corresponding discrete model .",
    "using this fact , we recently improved the accuracy of numerical estimates of continuous percolation of aligned cubes ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "we also generalized the excluded volume approximation @xcite to discrete systems and found that the limit of the continuous percolation is controlled by a power - law dependency with an exponent @xmath9 valid for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the main motivation behind the present paper is to verify whether the relation @xmath9 holds also for higher dimensions and if so , whether it can be used to improve the accuracy of continuous percolation thresholds in the model of aligned hypercubes in dimensions @xmath1 . with this selection",
    ", the conjecture will be verified numerically for all dimensions @xmath12 as well as in one case above @xmath6 , which should render its generalization to all @xmath13 plausible .",
    "answering these questions required to generate a lot of data , from which several other physically interesting quantities could also be determined .",
    "in particular , we managed to improve the accuracy of the correlation length critical exponent @xmath2 in dimensions @xmath7 and to determine the values of various universal wrapping probabilities in dimensions @xmath4 .",
    "we consider a hypercubic lattice of the linear size @xmath14 lattice units ( l.u . )  in a space dimension @xmath13 .",
    "this lattice is gradually filled with hypercubic `` obstacles '' of linear size @xmath15 l.u .",
    "( @xmath16 ) until a wrapping percolation has been found ( for the sake of simplicity , henceforth we will assume that @xmath14 , @xmath15 are dimensionless integers ) .",
    "the obstacles , aligned to the underlying lattice and with their edges coinciding with lattice nodes , are deposited at random into the lattice and the periodic boundary conditions in all directions are assumed to reduce finite - size effects . during this process the deposited hypercubes are free to overlap ; however , to enhance the simulation efficiency , no pair of obstacles is allowed to occupy exactly the same position .    as illustrated in figure",
    "[ fig : model ] ,     construction of the model in the space of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "an empty regular lattice of size @xmath17 lattice units ( l.u . )  with periodic boundary conditions ( a ) is filled at random with square obstacles of size @xmath18 l.u .",
    "aligned to the lattice axes ( b ) and the elementary cells occupied by the obstacles are identified ( c ) ; finally , a wrapping path through the occupied elementary cells ( site percolation ) is looked for ( d ) .",
    "the same method was used for larger @xmath13 . ]    the volume occupied by the obstacles can be regarded as a simple union of elementary lattice cells and the model is essentially discrete .",
    "two elementary cells are considered to be connected directly if and only if they are occupied by an obstacle and share the same hyperface of an elementary cell .",
    "we define a percolation cluster as a set of the elementary cells wrapping around the system through a sequence of directly connected elementary cells .",
    "thus , the model interpolates between the site percolation on a hypercubic lattice for @xmath19 and the model of continuous percolation of aligned hypercubes @xcite in the limit of @xmath20 .",
    "the percolation threshold is often expressed in terms of the volume fraction @xmath21 defined as the ratio of the number of the elementary cells occupied by the obstacles to the system volume , @xmath22 . what is the expected value of @xmath21 after @xmath23 hypercubes",
    "have been placed at random ( but different ) positions ? to answer this question , notice that while the obstacles can overlap , they can be located at exactly @xmath24 distinct locations and so @xmath25 . moreover , owing to the periodic boundary conditions , any elementary cell can be occupied by exactly @xmath26 different hypercubes , where @xmath27 is the volume of a hypercube .",
    "thus , the probability that an elementary cell is not occupied by an obstacle , @xmath28 , is equal to the product of @xmath26 probabilities that no hypercubes were placed at @xmath26 locations .",
    "this implies that @xmath29 for @xmath19 this formula reduces to @xmath30 irrespective of @xmath13 . in the limit of @xmath20 equation ( [ eq : def - phi ] ) reduces to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the reduced number density @xcite .",
    "the number of lattice sites in a cluster of linear size @xmath14 is of order of @xmath24 , a quantity rapidly growing with @xmath14 in high dimensions @xmath13 .",
    "this imposes severe constraints on numerical methods . on the one hand",
    ", one would like to have a large @xmath14 to minimize finite - size effects , which are particularly important near a critical state ; on the other hand , dealing with @xmath24 objects exerts a pressure on the computer storage and computational time . to mitigate this problem ,",
    "special algorithms were developed that focus on the efficient use of the computer memory .",
    "for example , leath s algorithm @xcite , in which a single cluster is grown from a single - site `` seed '' , turned out very successful in high - dimensional simulations of site and bond percolation @xcite .",
    "however , the use of such algorithms in the present model would be impractical , as the obstacle linear size @xmath15 is now allowed to assume values as large as 1000 , which greatly complicates the definition of leath s `` active neighborhood '' of a cluster .    therefore we used a different approach , with data structures typical of algorithms designed for the continuous percolation : each hypercube is identified by its coordinates , i.e. , by @xmath13 integers , and the clusters are identified using the union - find algorithm . with this choice , the computer memory storage , as well as the simulation time of each percolation cluster ,",
    "is @xmath33 , which enables one to use large values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we were able to run the simulations for @xmath34 ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 @xmath40 , and @xmath41 @xmath42 , and the maximum values of @xmath43 were limited by the acceptable computation time rather than the storage .",
    "the simulation time in our method is determined by how quickly one can identify all obstacles connected to the next obstacle being added to the system . to speed this step up , we divided the system into @xmath44 bins of linear size @xmath43 .",
    "each obstacle was assigned to exactly one bin and for each bin we stored a list of obstacles already assigned to it . in this way , upon adding a new obstacle , the program had to check @xmath45 neighboring bins to identify all obstacles connected to the just added one .",
    "as @xmath13 increases , this step becomes the most time - consuming part of the algorithm .",
    "fortunately , the negative impact of the @xmath45 factor is to some extent mitigated by the fact that the critical volume fraction , @xmath46 , is much smaller for @xmath47 than for @xmath19 , so that for @xmath47 one needs to generate a relatively small number of obstacles to reach the percolation .",
    "this is related to the fact that for @xmath48 the value of @xmath49 @xcite , whereas @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath19 is special in that one has to check only @xmath51 neighboring sites of a given obstacle , a value much smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the total simulation time at a high space dimension for a fixed value of @xmath43 can be approximated as @xmath52 for @xmath19 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 . in practice , simulations in the space dimension @xmath55 ( with @xmath43 fixed ) are between 8 to 13 times faster for @xmath19 than for @xmath47 .",
    "this allowed us to run more simulations and obtain more accurate results for @xmath19 than for @xmath54 .",
    "we assumed periodic boundary conditions along all @xmath13 main directions of the lattice .",
    "the number of independent samples varied from @xmath56 for very small systems ( e.g. , @xmath8 , @xmath19 , @xmath57 ) to @xmath58 for larger @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xmath55 , @xmath19 , @xmath59 ) . starting from an empty system of volume @xmath24 , we added hypercubes of volume @xmath60 at different random locations until we have detected wrapping clusters in all @xmath13 directions .",
    "thus , for each simulation we stored @xmath13 numbers @xmath61 equal to the number of hypercubes for which a wrapping percolation was first detected along cartesian direction @xmath62 .",
    "having determined all @xmath61 in a given simulation , we can use several definitions of the onset of percolation in a finite - size system @xcite .",
    "for example , one can assume that the system percolates when there is a wrapping cluster along some preselected direction @xmath63 , say , @xmath64 . we shall call this definition ` case  a ' .",
    "alternatively , a system could be said to be percolating when there is a wrapping cluster along _ any _ of the @xmath13 directions .",
    "we shall call this ` case  b '",
    ". another popular definition of a percolation in a finite - size system is the requirement that the wrapping condition must be satisfied in _ all _ @xmath13 directions .",
    "this will be denoted as ` case  c ' .",
    "next , for each of the three percolation definitions , a , b and c , we determined the probability @xmath65 that a system of size @xmath14 , obstacle size @xmath15 , and volume fraction @xmath21 contains a percolating ( wrapping ) cluster .",
    "this step is based on a probability distribution function constructed from from all @xmath61 in case a , from all @xmath66 in case b , and from all @xmath67 in case c. notice that in case a we take advantage of the symmetry of the system which ensures that all main directions are equivalent so that after @xmath23 simulations we have @xmath68 pieces of data from which a single probability distribution function can be constructed . in doing this",
    "we implicitly assume that all @xmath61 are independent of each other , which may improve statistics .",
    "fixing @xmath69 and @xmath15 , and using ( [ eq : def - phi ] ) , we can write @xmath70 as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath71 . in accordance with the finite - size scaling theory , @xmath70 is expected to scale with @xmath14 and the deviation @xmath72 from the critical volume fraction @xmath73 as @xcite @xmath74l^{1/\\nu }                  \\right ) , \\quad   l / k \\gg 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the correlation length exponent , @xmath75 is a scaling function , and @xmath21 is related to @xmath23 through ( [ eq : def - phi ] ) .",
    "this formula describes the probability that there is a percolation cluster in a system containing exactly @xmath23 obstacles , i.e. , is a quantity computed for a `` microcanonical percolation ensemble '' .",
    "the corresponding value in the canonical ensemble is @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the probability that there is an obstacle assigned to a given location ; this quantity is related to the mean occupied volume fraction through @xmath78 while @xmath79 is a discrete function , @xmath80 is defined for all @xmath81 and has a reduced statistical noise . by using ( [ eq : phi - p ] ) , @xmath82 can be regarded as a continuous function of @xmath21 for @xmath83 .",
    "an effective , @xmath14-dependent volume fraction @xmath84 was then determined numerically as the solution to @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a fixed parameter , and we chose @xmath87 in all our calculations . the critical volume fraction , @xmath73 , as well as the critical exponent @xmath2",
    "are then determined using the scaling relation @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 are some @xmath15- and @xmath13-dependent parameters and @xmath90 is the cutoff parameter .",
    "recently a more general scaling ansatz for the form of the probability @xmath82 in the vicinity of the critical point was proposed @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a universal constant , @xmath93 is the leading correction exponent , and @xmath94 are some nonuniversal , model - dependent parameters . at the critical point",
    "this reduces to @xmath95 we used this ansatz to determine the universal , @xmath15-independent constant @xmath92 @xcite representing the probability that a wrapping cluster exists at the critical point .",
    "relation ( [ eq : phi - scaling ] ) contains @xmath96 unknowns : @xmath73 , @xmath2 , and @xmath89 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath2 can be also estimated from an alternative relation containing @xmath97 unknowns by noticing that ( [ eq : scaling ] ) leads to @xmath98 where @xmath99 . to take into account finite - size corrections , we used a formula @xmath100 where @xmath101 are some parameters and we used @xmath102 . actually , since @xmath103 is a quickly growing function near @xmath73 , we calculated the derivative of its inverse , @xmath104 using a five - point stencil , @xmath105/12h$ ] with @xmath106 .",
    "in @xcite we conjectured that for sufficiently large @xmath15 @xmath107                 \\propto k^{-\\theta},\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the critical volume fraction for the continuous percolation of aligned hypercubes and @xmath0 .",
    "the left - hand side of ( [ eq : approx - k32 ] ) was derived using the excluded volume approximation applied to discrete systems , whereas its right - hand - side was obtained numerically and verified for @xmath109 .",
    "this formula enables one to estimate @xmath110 from the critical volumes @xmath46 obtained for discrete ( lattice ) models with finite @xmath15 by investigating the rate of their convergence as @xmath20 .",
    "its characteristic feature is the conjectured independence of @xmath111 on @xmath13 that we verify in this report .",
    "the uncertainties of the results were determined as follows .",
    "first , the percolation data were divided into 10 disjoint groups .",
    "then for each group the value of @xmath84 was calculated in the way described above .",
    "the value of @xmath84 was then assumed to be equal to their average value , and its uncertainty  to the standard error of the mean .",
    "next , the value of @xmath73 was obtained from a non - linear fitting to eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi - scaling ] ) using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm , with the errors on the parameters estimated from the square roots of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , multiplied by @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the reduced chi - square statistic .",
    "the same method was used to estimate the value and uncertainty of @xmath110 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx - k32 ] ) .    finally , making up the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) is potentially even more tricky than in site percolation , as in our model @xmath114 can be as large as @xmath115 . in solving this technical problem",
    "we followed the method reported in @xcite if @xmath114 could be stored in a 64-bit integer , otherwise we approximated the binomial distribution with the normal distribution .",
    "another point worth noticing is that @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) can be as small as @xmath116 .",
    "in such a case expressions like @xmath117 should be computed using appropriate numerical functions , e.g. , log1p from the c++ standard library , which is designed to produce values of @xmath118 with @xmath119 without a potential loss of significance in the sum @xmath120 .",
    "we start our analysis from the particular case @xmath19 , in which the model reduces to the standard site percolation .",
    "as site percolation has been analyzed extensively with many dedicated methods , we were going to use the case @xmath19 only to test the correctness of our computer code , but as it turned out , we have managed to obtain some new results , too .",
    "the main results are summarized in table  [ tab : site - percolation ] .",

    "for @xmath8 this behavior is also similar to that observed in the site percolation ( @xmath19 ) . in higher dimensions the convergence patterns are different : the site percolation is characterized by a nonmonotonic dependence of @xmath172 on @xmath43 , whereas in continuous percolation this dependency is monotonic .",

    "the data in figure  [ fig : pdfs ] allows one to make also another observation . using ( [ eq : tau ] ) with @xmath87 and the raw data for @xmath8 , one can estimate the percolation threshold with the accuracy of @xmath189 . using extrapolation ,",
    "this can be improved by a factor of @xmath190 to reach the accuracy reported in table  [ tab : continuous - percolation ] . for @xmath55 and @xmath191 the error from the raw data is already very small , @xmath192 .",
    "extrapolation can be still used to reduce it further , but since now the data come from systems of smaller linear size ( @xmath193 rather than @xmath34 for @xmath8 ) , the reduction factor is also smaller , of the order of @xmath194 .",

    "second , even though the uncertainties of @xmath162 and @xmath163 are typically high , often exceeding 100% @xcite , one can notice that their magnitude grows with @xmath13 , which means that the magnitude of the corrections to scaling also grows with @xmath13 .",
    "this is particularly important for @xmath162 , which controls the main contribution to the corrections to scaling for large system sizes @xmath14 .",
    "the absolute value of this parameter for @xmath19 is very likely to be at least two orders of magnitude larger for @xmath55 than for @xmath8 .",

    "figure  [ fig : ypc - individual ] and @xcite ) .",
    "actually , for @xmath8 the value of the linear coefficient , @xmath162 , is so close to zero that the convergence rate of @xmath172 in simulations is effectively controlled by the quadratic term , @xmath163 , an effect also reported in @xcite .    once @xmath92 is known with sufficiently low uncertainty , one can try and use it to reduce the corrections to scaling by assuming @xmath228 in ( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "this method turned out very successful for @xmath10 @xcite , but in this case @xmath92 is known exactly @xcite .",
    "availability of the exact value of @xmath92 appears crucial , because the leading term in ( [ eq : phi - scaling ] ) has special properties only at @xmath228 so that small errors in @xmath92 may disturb the fitting .",
    "we checked that , as expected , setting @xmath228 in dimensions @xmath229 significantly increased the convergence rate ; however , it did not result in more accurate values of the percolation threshold , probably due to the errors in @xmath92 and the fact that the uncertainty of the extrapolated value ( @xmath146 ) is closely related to the uncertainty of the data being extrapolated ( @xmath73 ) , which is independent of @xmath230 ( data not shown ) .",
    "finally , we checked that the value of @xmath92 is universal for other definitions of percolation in finite - size systems .",
    "if we assumed that a system percolates when a wrapping cluster appears in any direction ( case b ) , we obtained @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath235 for @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "when we waited until a wrapping condition was satisfied along all @xmath13 directions ( case c ) , we obtained @xmath236 , 0.0291(3 ) , 0.0187(3 ) , 0.0224(9 ) , and 0.043(3 ) for @xmath161 , respectively .",

    "actually , for @xmath4 the uncertainty of the continuous percolation threshold is now so small that it matches or even slightly surpasses that for the site percolation .",
    "we were also able to confirm the universality of the wrapping probability @xmath92 and determine its value for @xmath4 for several definitions of the onset of percolation in finite - size systems .",
    "the method proposed here has several advantages .",
    "first , it allows one to reduce the statistical noise of computer simulations by transforming the results from the microcanonical to canonical ensemble .",
    "second , it allows to exploit the universality of the convergence rate of the discrete model to the continuous one , which we found to be controlled by a universal exponent @xmath145 for all @xmath13 .",
    "finally , it can be readily applied to several important shapes not studied here , like hyperspheres or hyperneedles .",
    "one drawback of the method is that it does not seem suitable for continuous models in which the obstacles are free to rotate , e.g. randomly oriented hypercubes .",
    "we also did not take into account logarithmic corrections to scaling at the upper critical dimension @xcite , which may render our error estimates at @xmath240 too optimistic .",
    "our results for the continuous percolation threshold in dimensions @xmath241 are incompatible with those reported recently in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this remains unknown , and we guess that they are related to corrections to scaling , which quickly grow with @xmath13 .    finally , we have managed to improve the accuracy of the critical exponent @xmath2 measurement in dimensions @xmath7 .",
