    "we should keep in mind that there are two different aspects from the classical gaseous disk investigated by lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) : ( 1 ) radius - dependent viscosity driven by snexp and ( 2 ) dropout of mass and angular momentum due to star formation on the disk .",

    "we show three types of the solutions : ( 1 ) @xmath68 , ( 2 ) @xmath69 , and ( 3 ) @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath70 solutions are quite simple and similar to the pure diffusion of a gaseous ring described in lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) .",
    "the ring dramatically spreads over the space and forms stars . a stellar ring forms then as shown in figure 3(b ) @xmath71 panel .",
    "for @xmath69 solution , there is a flat envelope without peak and valley , forming a very broader stellar ring as shown in the figure 3(b ) @xmath72 panel .",
    "the @xmath73 solutions have complicated behaviors as shown in figure 3(a ) @xmath74 panel .",
    "evolution of the gas ring can be divided into three phases . at early time",
    ", star formation is only important in the role of transportation of angular momentum , and the mass dropout can be neglected .",
    "behaviors of the ring are very similar to the pure fluid ring .",
    "the gas rapidly diffuses inward mostly and outward a little bit carrying away the angular momentum .",
    "though the star formation rates are very high , the total formed stars are not many since the duration of this phase is quite short .",
    "the second phase begins when mass dropout due to star formation becomes important .",
    "decrease of the gas density is leading to decrease of star formation and weakening the viscosity torque of snexp , resulting in accumulation of gas at the radius @xmath64 .",
    "the third phase starts when the viscosity torque is enhanced in light of the gas accumulation .",
    "this causes intensive star formation and exhausts gas , giving rise to an exponential decreases of gas density .",
    "[ fig3 ] 0.3 cm    to understand such behaviors of solutions , we compare the timescales of star formation ( @xmath75 ) and gas advection ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "according to the @xmath57-definition , it follows @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath78 at @xmath56 ( roughly corresponding to @xmath79 ) , most of the gas is converted into stars at @xmath56 and only a little gas is conveyed inward . in contrast ,",
    "in the @xmath80 case ( namely , @xmath81 ) at initial radius @xmath56 , star formation is so slow that most of the gas is advected inward . for a case with initial @xmath81 ,",
    "most of gas is advected inward until @xmath82 .",
    "pile - up of gas appears at @xmath64 then and forms stars .",
    "the complicated behaviors of gas density are results as a consequence of competition between the two processes .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the surface density of stars for the corresponding gas density . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the gas rapidly diffuses inward and there is no significant pile - up of stars at the initial radius @xmath56 . a stellar ring forms at roughly @xmath83 far away from its initial radius .",
    "the ring becomes broader with increases of @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath69 , there begins to be a tiny pile - up of stars at the initial radius . for a case with a large @xmath57 , pile - up of stars happens very close to the initial radius and it becomes more conspicuous with @xmath57 .",
    "the stellar rings become wider with @xmath57 . figure 3(c ) displays evolution of the toomre parameter @xmath46 , clearly showing @xmath84 in the star - forming region .",
    "@xmath46-values are quite different in different regions .",
    "this strengthens the importance of self - gravity in the secular evolution of the gaseous disk .",
    "since @xmath85 , @xmath46 basically follows the evolution of @xmath86 .",
    "a generic property of the @xmath46-parameter is that it increases with time since the gas is being converted into stars .",
    "this is totally different from the steady gaseous disk with star formation under the presumed condition of @xmath87 suggested by thompson et al .",

    "a detailed discussion on this nonlinear effects is beyond the scope of this letter , but it would be interesting to solve the nonlinear equations to display the effects in future work . this model may apply to different kinds of galaxies .      successive multiple minor mergers may provide an initial gas widely distributed in the major galaxies ( hernquist & mihos 1995 ; bournaud et al . 2007 ) . for a simplicity , we assume an initial distribution with a power law of radius as @xmath88 , where @xmath89kpc , @xmath90 is the surface density at @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the index .",

    "shows the evolution of gaseous disk .",
    "we calculate the cases of @xmath96 between @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for @xmath99 disk ,",
    "the most dense part of the disk is located in the radius with @xmath100 , so the gas is converted to stars locally .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath101 case gas is concentrated outside the region with @xmath102 .",
    "the gas diffuses quite rapidly and transfers to the inner radius and forms stars , leaving a relatively broader stellar ring or disk .",
    "an initial homogeneous disk has a complex behaviors between the two cases above , inner part of the gas forms stars locally whereas outer part flows inward and then forms stars .",
    "the toomre parameter shows strong variability with time , but holding @xmath84 in most star - forming region .",
    "[ fig5 ] 0.3 cm    the instability of the gaseous disks can be simply justified by the operating mechanism of the viscosity . when gas is piled up , the higher star formation rates can efficiently remove the angular momentum of gas , and then suppress the star formation rates .",
    "the system should be self - organized and stable .",
    "however , we should give a detail description of stability analysis in a future paper .",

    "the ring radius is @xmath110kpc and the dispersion velocity of galaxy is @xmath111 and the surface density of star formation rate is @xmath112 .",
    "the current data does not allow us to distinguish the case of different @xmath92 we thus just use @xmath113 as an illustration .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the galaxy is shown by the red line in the right column of fig .",
    "the current stage of the ring is approaching the end states of the star forming .",
    "the stellar ring is still growing fast and may remain as a wide stellar ring .",
    "the @xmath46-value shows that self - gravity is also dominated .",
    "we note that the solutions presented here tend to show an exponential stellar disk if the time is long enough .",
    "this agrees with the steady disks known for quite long time from lin & pringle ( 1987 ) .",
    "the simple application of the current model shows here that snexp does indeed play a key role in the dynamical evolution of the gaseous rings or disks .",
    "however , the application should be improved with the more detail data .",
    "for example , the good - quality data of h@xmath5 ring profile and the spatially resolved spectroscopy will allow us to get the evolution stage of gas and star formation from the stellar synthesis .",
    "particularly , the very sharp inner edge of the ring predicted here is caused by snexp .",
    "this reflects feedback of the star formation .",
    "additionally , application of the present model to a large sample ( e.g. fster schreiber et al . 2009 ) will produce the initial conditions of the sample for a statistics in future .",
    "this will be invaluable to justify the origin of the cold gas .",
    "we would like to stress here that the present applications focus on the main features of galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "the ring or disk models for the two galaxies are less conclusive .",
    "we need more information of the galaxies , such as , stellar ages at different ring radii , so as to give more robust pictures .",
    "degeneracies of parameters limit applications of the model .",
    "we set up a model of gaseous disk with star formation , in which the viscosity is driven by turbulence excited by snexp .",
    "we get the analytical solutions for the initial condition of single gas ring , showing complicated secular evolutionary behaviors .",
    "several different kinds of stellar distributions can be formed , including exponential types .",

    "the model will be improved in several aspects in future by using : ( 1 ) nonlinear star formation law , ( 2 ) separated equations of stars and gas , and ( 3 ) initially twisted gaseous disk ( lu & cheng 1991 ) .",
    "these will help us to get the initial conditions as a consequence of minor mergers and allow us to study the evolution of stellar disks and bulges .    1 bournaud , f. , jog , c. j. & combes , f. 2007 , , 476 , 1179 bower , r. g. et al .",
