    "it is now well established that the idea of a `` wounded '' source of particles @xcite turned out rather useful in description of particle production from nuclear targets @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore interesting to verify to what extent the recent high energy data confirm this hypothesis and what are its consequences for the evolution of the system created in heavy ion collisions at high energy .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .    a wounded source , by definition , emits a fixed density of particles , independently of the number of collisions it underwent inside the nucleus . to understand the physical meaning of this concept ,",
    "let us recall the original argument leading to this idea .",
    "the idea can be understood if one observes that the process of particle production is not instantaneous .",
    "this was first noted ( and the consequences for scattering at high energies derived ) by landau and pomeranchuk @xcite .",
    "a simplified version of the argument can be presented as follows .",
    "consider a particle created in a high - energy collision . in the reference frame",
    "where the longitudinal momentum of this particle vanishes , the minimal time necessary for its creation is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is its energy .",
    "consider now the  laboratory  frame where the target nucleus is at rest . in this frame",
    "the particle in question acquires some longitudinal momentum , the time is multiplied by the lorentz factor , and we have@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy of the particle .",
    "consequently , the uncertainty of the distance from the collision point to that at which the particle is created ( i.e. the resolving power of the longitudinal distance ) is @xmath8    when this distance is longer than the size of the nucleus , @xmath9 , at a given impact parameter i.e. when the rapidity of the produced particle is large enough , the particle can not resolve individual collisions and therefore it is natural to admit that its creation may be insensitive to the number of collisions of the source .",
    "this is the origin of the idea of wounded sources and it is clear that it makes sense only when one considers production of particles with the laboratory rapidity exceeding that determined by the condition @xmath10 .",
    "but at small laboratory rapidities particle production from a fast - moving source is anyway expected to be small ( if not negligible ) .",
    "therefore the concept of the wounded source can be applied in practice in the whole rapidity region .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that the idea of wounded constituents of the nucleon can successfully explain the centrality dependence of particle production at @xmath11 in @xmath0 collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "assuming that high energy interactions of nucleons are dominated by independent interactions of its two constituents , a quark and a diquark ( each one producing the same particle density ) , it was possible to explain the small momentum transfer elastic @xmath12 and @xmath13 scattering @xcite as well as energy and centrality dependence of particle production in @xmath0 collisions at the same time .",
    "encouraged by these results , in the present paper we extend the analysis to rapidities in a wide range beyond the central region using data on particle production in @xmath14 @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions at @xmath15 gev c.m .",
    "energy .",
    "our main conclusion is that the data are in reasonable agreement with the wounded quark - diquark model in a wide range of rapidities excluding , however , the narrow target and projectile fragmentation regions . in the fragmentation regions two additional contributions",
    "could be identified :    \\(i ) first , it is necessary to account for the decay products of the constituents which did not interact (  unwounded  ) but belong to a wounded nucleon . since such constituents are coloured , they have to decay into observable particles .",
    "\\(ii ) one also has to take into account particle production by secondary interactions of particles produced by the projectile inside the nucleus .",
    "since , as already explained , the fast particles ( in the rest frame of the nucleus ) are produced outside the nucleus , the secondary interaction may only produce particles which are slow in the rest frame of the nucleus .    in the next section we present a general formulation of the model .",
    "the @xmath2 collisions are discussed in section @xmath16 and the nucleus - nucleus collisions in section @xmath17 .",
    "our conclusions are listed in the last section where also some comments are included .",
    "in the central rapidity region the model predicts that the density of particles produced in collision of nucleus @xmath18 with nucleus @xmath19 is given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of wounded constituents ( quarks and diquarks ) in the nucleus @xmath22 , whereas @xmath23 and @xmath24 are particle densities emitted by one wounded quark or diquark in the nucleus @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "evaluation of @xmath25 for various processes considered in this paper is given in the appendix .",
    "in the c.m .",
    "system we have , of course @xmath26 where from now on , @xmath27 shall always denote rapidity in the c.m .",
    "as explained in introduction , to extend the description to the region close to the maximal and minimal rapidities , it is necessary to take into account at least two other contributions to particle production . taking this into account , the eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) is modified into @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 represents the contribution from the decay of one unwounded constituent ( but belonging to a wounded nucleon ) and @xmath31 is the number of unwounded constituents in the nucleus @xmath22 . it can be simply determined using our assumption that each nucleon consists of two active constituents ( a quark and a diquark)@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of wounded nucleons in the nucleus @xmath22 .    the terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the  intranuclear cascade  , i.e. , the contribution from secondary interactions of particles created inside the nucleus .    the contributions @xmath36 and @xmath34 are expected to be significant only at @xmath27 close to @xmath37 ( the @xmath38 rapidity of the nucleon in nucleus @xmath18 ) .",
    "similarly the @xmath39 and @xmath35 are expected to be significant only at @xmath27 close to @xmath40 .    in nucleon - nucleon collisions ,",

    "they describe the data in terms of three unknown functions .",
    "since these functions have a well defined physical meaning , the important result of our investigation is not only to verify the validity of ( [ wnu ] ) and ( [ pp ] ) but also determination of the emission function of a wounded constituent @xmath44 , the decay distribution of an unwounded constituent @xmath45 and the  cascade  contribution @xmath46 .",

    "contributions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this simplification allows to investigate the data in terms of only two functions : @xmath57 and @xmath58 , being the densities of particles produced from one wounded or unwounded constituent , respectively .",
    "this condition is well justified for the deuteron since the intranuclear cascade in this case is negligible . on the other hand",
    ", we expect a discrepancy in the @xmath59 fragmentation region .",
    "this discrepancy provides a measure of the effect .",
    "we construct @xmath60 and @xmath61 using the phobos @xmath2 data @xcite .",
    "first , to avoid propagation of the slight difference between the model and the data observed at @xmath11 ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig_dau_mid ] ) , we adjust data to the model at this point , multiplying at each rapidity by a constant ( for each centrality ) factor @xmath62 .",
    "this allows to discuss the shape of the distributions in rapidity independently of the absolute normalization ( which is also consistent with the model , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_dau_mid ] ) .",
    "next we verified that in the pseudorapidity range @xmath63 the contribution from the decay of unwounded constituents is not necessary for description of data and thus one can take @xmath64 .",
    "it means that the data in this region can be described solely in terms of wounded constituents .",
    "this was confirmed by analysing the data on the deuteron side ( @xmath65 ) in terms of three functions : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . from this analysis",
    "we have also found that @xmath69 for @xmath70 .    using these findings and the @xmath71 centrality phobos data one observes a certain difference between the star and phobos data for @xmath72 centrality .",
    "therefore we preferred to take the @xmath71 centrality where this difference is much smaller .",
    "] it was possible to determine @xmath60 for @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath70 we used the @xmath71 and @xmath73 centrality phobos data to obtain both @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    in fig .",

    "the discrepancy for @xmath77 can be attributed to the additional  cascade  contribution which is expected in the @xmath59 fragmentation region .",
    "large errors do not allow , unfortunately , to perform a more quantitative analysis of this phenomenon .",
    "all in all , the results presented in fig . [ fig_dau ] show that the model describes correctly the data .",
    "data from phobos and star coll .",
    "the data are normalized to the model prediction at @xmath78 one sees a generally good agreement except in the @xmath59 fragmentation region where the contribution from secondary interactions inside the target apparently becomes important . ]",
    "phobos data . for comparison we also present the prediction without contribution from unwounded constituents .",
    "one sees that it is necessary to account for the data . ]    since the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are now determined , it is possible to construct the model prediction for @xmath12 collisions . in fig .",
    "[ fig_pp ] this is confronted with preliminary @xmath12 phobos data @xcite .",
    "we see that the agreement is very good . for comparison we also present the prediction of the model without contribution from unwounded constituents .",
    "it appears that this contribution is indeed needed .",
    "we feel that this result indicates that the physics of particle production in @xmath12 and @xmath2 collisions is basically the same ( apart from the trivial difference in the form of intranuclear cascade )",
    ".    it may be interesting at this point to speculate about the possible mechanism which may lead to the results for @xmath60 and @xmath61 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_uf ] .",
    "the very broad rapidity distribution of particles emitted by the wounded source suggests a colour - exchange mechanism . the simplest possibility is the multi - gluon exchange between the projectile and target ( every gluon exchange changes the colour of the source and",
    "thus may lead to particle production ) .",
    "since every constituent consists of many partons and since the probability of exchanging a gluon between two partons does not depend on their rapidity difference ( gluon is a particle of spin 1 ) , one may fairly easily obtain a rather broad rapidity distribution of the produced particles .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this picture can naturally accommodate the asymmetric shape of @xmath60 ( the shoulder seen at @xmath81 is -most likely- the kinematic effect related to the transformation from rapidity to pseudorapidity ) . on the other hand , particle production from the unwounded source",
    "can be understood as resulting from the decay of a string spanned between the wounded and unwounded constituent .",
    "the details of this picture and its derivation from fundamental theory represents an interesting problem which , however , goes beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "in fig . [ fig_auau ] we compare the predictions of the wounded quark - diquark model with the phobos data @xcite in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "this observation shows that the intranuclear cascade is not effective for central nucleus - nucleus collisions , thus suggesting that the secondary interactions in the nucleus lead to particle production mainly if they happen on the spectator nucleons",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate this point in more detail when more precise data are available .",
    "the values of the numbers of wounded constituents for various centralities are given in the appendix .",
    "data from phobos coll . ]",
    "we have found in the previous section that @xmath60 , the contribution form wounded constituents , largely dominates the spectrum in the region @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath83 this consequence of the model is known to be very well satisfied by @xmath0 and @xmath1 data @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] @xmath84 evaluated from the model is shown versus the number of wounded nucleons ( the same for @xmath59 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "one sees that it is very close to @xmath86 , also in agreement with data @xcite .",
    "collisions to that produced in @xmath1 collisions at the same number of wounded nucleons . for comparison we also present the results at @xmath87 gev c.m .",
    "our conclusions can be formulated as follows .",
    "\\(i ) we have compared the wounded quark - diquark model with the phobos data on particle production in @xmath14 @xmath88 @xmath1 and @xmath0 collisions at @xmath15 gev c.m .",
    "energy in the full range of rapidity .",
    "the shape of the rapidity distribution is well reconstructed .",
    "the overall normalization of the @xmath2 data is not described so well , although it is consistent with the model within the ( still rather large ) experimental uncertainties .",
    "\\(ii ) the particle emission function from one wounded constituent is determined .",
    "its most important features are : ( a ) a large maximum in the forward direction ; ( b ) a significant fraction of particles emitted in the backward hemisphere ; ( c ) strong suppression of particle emission in the target fragmentation region .",
    "\\(iii ) particle emission from unwounded constituents contributes only to the fragmentation region of the projectile .",
    "\\(iv ) particle production from secondary interactions inside the nucleus are confined to its fragmentation region , in agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "these secondary interactions seem to have stronger effect on particle production in nucleon - nucleus than in the central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "\\(v ) for the good agreement of the model with data it was crucial to accept that each wounded constituent emits the same density of particles .",
    "this somewhat surprising result indicates that intensity of particle emission is mainly determined by the colour content of the source ( the colour content of quark and diquark are the same ) .",
    "this suggests the colour - exchange models as a possible mechanism responsible for particle production , in harmony with the discussion at the end of section 3 .",
    "following comments are in order .",
    "\\(i ) contrary to the common prejudice , good agreement of the wounded constituent model with @xmath0 and @xmath1 data is _ not _ in contradiction with the collective phenomena observed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it only shows that in all hadronic collisions _ the early stage _ of the particle production process can be understood as a superposition of contributions from hadronic constituents .",
    "this does not preclude further collective evolution of the system which obviously must be more visible in the system produced in collision of two heavy nuclei than , e.g. , in nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "\\(ii ) the wounded constituent picture has , however , important consequences for the properties of the hot matter created in heavy ion collisions . first of all , it implies that most of the entropy must be produced already at the very early stage of the collision .",
    "it also implies rather early equilibration in transverse direction , presumably already at the level of nucleon - nucleon collisions @xcite .",
    "finally , the absence of the visible effects of the longitudinal pressure in @xmath0 collisions ( which would modify somewhat the rapidity distribution ) suggests that the early evolution of the plasma may be dominated by the purely _ transverse _ hydrodynamic expansion while the longitudinal evolution is described by free - streaming .",
    "this possibility ( which solves the `` problem of early equilibration '' ) was investigated recently @xcite and shown to be in agreement with data on elliptic flow .",
    "one may thus consider our result as an indirect confirmation of the hypothesis formulated in @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the model describes particle production in nucleon - nucleon collisions as emission from two ( left- and right - moving ) sources , both populating most of the available phase - space .",
    "this picture suggests presence of specific long - range , forward - backward correlations .",
    "it would be interesting to study these correlations in more detail .",
    "\\(iv ) in the present investigation we have entirely neglected the possible dependence on transverse mass , thus implicitly assuming that @xmath89 distributions do not vary significantly with the varying centrality of the collision .",
    "this is approximately correct for the bulk of created particles ( mostly pions at small transverse momentum ) but it would be certainly interesting to investigate limits of the wounded constituent model at higher transverse momenta and for heavy particles .",
    "\\(v ) the model provides a natural qualitative explanation of the  stopping  of a high - energy nucleon in a collision with the heavy nucleus @xcite .",
    "indeed , since the contribution from an unwounded constituent dominates the very end of rapidity phase - space and since the number of unwounded constituents in the nucleon passing through a nucleus is smaller than that in a nucleon - nucleon collision , one expects less high - energy nucleons in the former case .",
    "a quantitative estimate of this effect may provide information about the momentum distribution of the constituents ( quark and diquark ) inside the nucleon .",
