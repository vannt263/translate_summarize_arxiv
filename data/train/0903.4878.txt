    "disordered elastic manifolds play an important role in a variety of physical systems . growing surfaces ,  @xcite interfaces in domain growth phenomena and phase separation ,  @xcite and cracks in brittle materials  @xcite are usually viewed as elastic objects .",
    "interesting one dimensional realizations are polymers  @xcite and vortex flux lines in type ii superconductors .",
    "@xcite while polymers can wrap , vortex flux lines are preferentially directed along the applied magnetic field .    a number of systems involving one dimensional elastic manifolds display glassy features .",
    "an ensemble of interacting polymers forms a polymer melt that undergoes a glass transition .",
    "@xcite the competition between vortex repulsion and their pinning to randomly located impurities also leads to glassy phases in superconductors .",
    "@xcite while in the former case disorder is self - induced , in the latter the effect of the impurities is mimicked by a quenched random potential .",
    "the relaxation dynamics of a model of layered high @xmath1 superconductors was recently studied in ref .  .",
    "the magnetic vortices are considered to be directed along one direction and they can move in two transverse directions . conventionally , this is a @xmath2+@xmath3 dimensional model .",
    "the dynamics following a rapid quench from the liquid state to a set of control parameters in which the equilibrium state is expected to be the so - called ` vortex glass '  @xcite was monitored . by using numerical simulations a slow out of equilibrium relaxation typical of glasses",
    "was found . in this system ,",
    "diffusive aging of the averaged two - time roughness , @xmath4 , and displacement , @xmath5 , was observed .",
    "the aging was characterized by a _ multiplicative _ scaling form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a growing characteristic length .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are different but the exponent @xmath10 does not depend on the observable ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) . besides , the system of interacting lines was perturbed in order to compute the integrated linear response , and a diffusive aging was also found , characterized by a scaling function of the type @xmath13 with the _ same _ exponent @xmath10 and growing length @xmath7 found for the unperturbed two - time observables ( roughness and displacement ) .",
    "it was also shown that correlation and response functions can be related by a modified fluctuation - dissipation relation after removing the ` diffusive ' contribution , _",
    "i.e. _ the factors @xmath14",
    ". this violation of the fluctuation - dissipation relation can be characterized by a _ finite _ effective temperature , @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , within the time - window that was numerically explored , the growing length @xmath7 is well - described by a power - law , @xmath16 .",
    "this could well be a _",
    "pre - asymptotic _ regime after which the growing length crosses over to the expected activated dynamics logarithmic growth ( when disorder free - energy barriers scale as @xmath17 with @xmath18 ) . it is worth to mention that although aging in high  @xcite and low  @xcite @xmath1 superconductor samples has been reported in the literature , a detailed comparison to the results listed above remains to be done .",
    "the model system used to describe vortex lines in high temperature superconductors contains several contributions coming from different energy scales .",
    "the main contributions are : the elastic energy of the individual lines , non - linear terms in the elastic energy , the interaction between the lines , and the quenched random pinning potential .",
    "it is clearly important to establish whether all the above listed contributions to the energy are necessary to get such aging behavior or whether similar features arise when some of the terms  non - linear contributions to the elasticity , interactions between the lines , random potential  are switched off .",
    "we review below the out of equilibrium dynamics of related models with and without this type of interactions .",
    "the first studies of the out of equilibrium dynamics of directed elastic manifolds in a quenched random environment focused on _ mean - field _ models in which the transverse space is infinitely dimensional , @xmath19 , each transverse coordinate has infinite length , @xmath20 , and the manifold has finite dimension , @xmath21 , and infinite length in all directions , @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite this model includes only two of the energetic contributions listed above _ viz . _ elasticity and quenched disorder and neglects non - linear terms and interactions between the elastic objects .",
    "a dynamic phase transition separating a liquid ( high - temperature ) phase from a glassy ( low - temperature ) one was found for all internal dimension @xmath21 including @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite different aging dynamics characterize the low - temperature phase depending on the short or long range character of the random potential correlations . in both cases the aging regime lasts for ever ( after having taken the @xmath19 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 limits ) : there is no multiplicative factor @xmath25 in the averaged two - time observables . for short - range correlated potentials",
    "the displacement , roughness and linear responses scale as @xmath26 and a single finite effective temperature exists .    soon after barrat  @xcite and yoshino  @xcite studied a solid - on - solid model of a single directed elastic line relaxing with monte carlo dynamics on a disordered substrate with one ( @xmath27 ) transverse direction .",
    "this system models elasticity in a rather extreme way , using a hard constrain , and includes quenched randomness .",
    "there are no interaction between different lines in this model .",
    "these authors focused on the very long length limit in an effectively infinite box ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 the lattice spacing ) and found that this lattice model has a similar averaged dynamics to the one found later in the vortex glass  @xcite below a crossover temperature .",
    "the relaxation is slow , and the global displacement and linear response show non - trivial _ diffusive _ aging with _ multiplicative _ scaling .",
    "the characteristic length scale also appears to be a power - law of time within the numerical time window and the exponents @xmath30 and @xmath31 are temperature and disorder strength dependent with the same qualitative trend as in the fully interacting case .",
    "more recently , we focused on the analysis of the averaged and fluctuating two - time roughness of such solid - on - solid lines with _ finite length _ , @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite on the one hand , we found that the aging regime stops and crosses over to saturation of the two - time roughness and free diffusion of the displacement at a characteristic value of the time delay , @xmath33 , that grows with the length of the line and smoothly depends on other parameters in the model .",
    "the saturation of the two - time roughness is well described by a generalization of the equilibrium family - vicsek scaling .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the two - time roughness fluctuations are highly non - trivial but can be characterized with a relatively simple argument by a scaling function .",
    "the numerical solution to the langevin equation for free lines in @xmath34 transverse dimensions  @xcite and , especially , the full analytic solution to the langevin dynamics of finite edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) elastic lines  @xcite in one transverse dimension  @xcite ( @xmath27 ) had also been considered , without taking into account interactions , non - linear terms and quenched randomness .",
    "the results suggested that not even disorder is necessary to obtain similar averaged and fluctuating aging dynamics of fully relaxing quantities .",
    "the aging scaling and saturation phenomenon of the averaged two - time roughness follow the same scaling laws as above with growing length @xmath35 , and temperature - independent exponents @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , the noise - averaged linear response is stationary in this ` quadratic ' model .",
    "when it comes to analyzing fluctuations other differences appear .",
    "the distribution of the two - time roughness satisfies a similar scaling law as in the disordered problem although with a rather different scaling function and the linear response simply does not fluctuate .",
    "the effect of non - linear terms has been considered by bustingorry  @xcite who analyzed the relaxation dynamics of ` clean ' finite length ( @xmath32 ) kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) lines  @xcite in @xmath27 transverse dimensions . in this work correlations",
    "were analyzed in detail and undergo diffusive aging with the kpz exponents @xmath10 , @xmath39 and @xmath30 . the two - time and length scaling of averaged quantities and the scaling form of the probability distribution functions proposed in ref .   were thus confirmed .",
    "finally , once the elastic lines are allowed to wrap , biologically motivated dynamic problems can also be addressed .",
    "a recent study concentrates on the effects of confinement on the out of equilibrium relaxation of a single polymer chain in two dimensions ,  @xcite a problem of relevance for cellular modelling .",
    "another study analyzes numerically the effect of randomly applied forces on an ensemble of interacting polymer lines , focusing on out of equilibrium properties of active matter .",
    "@xcite there is , certainly , much room for further investigations in the biological context .",
    "in this paper we return to the problem of the relaxation of directed elastic lines in the presence of quenched randomness .",
    "interactions among different lines and non - linear terms are not considered here .",
    "our aim is to complete the analysis of the averaged two - time observables . in order to compare with previous results and to extract the universal behaviour we treat two models in parallel : the monte carlo dynamics of the disordered solid - on - solid model  @xcite and the langevin dynamics of the disordered edwards - wilkinson equation in @xmath40 dimensions .",
    "we present a careful study of finite - length effects on the averaged dynamics of correlation and linear response functions .",
    "we pay special attention to the behavior of the crossover length between thermal and disorder dominated regimes , and discuss finite - size and finite - time effects .",
    "moreover , we show by using scaling arguments how this length scale determines the relaxation properties of the system .",

    "the influence of the crossover in the effective dynamical exponent @xmath341 of the power - law regime relevant to short length - scales , @xmath306 , follows from equating eq .   to @xmath342 , which yields @xmath343 to avoid solving the resulting self - consistent equation",
    ", we can use @xmath344 in the third member to obtain a first order correction to the dynamical exponent , @xmath345 since by construction the power - law fit of the data is done in a relatively short time - scale such that @xmath346 is almost constant ( otherwise @xmath341 would not be well defined ) , and by using @xmath347 and @xmath348 , we get @xmath349 this rough estimate is in good agreement with the numerically determined exponent @xmath39 shown in figs .  [ fig : parameters ] and  [ fig : alfadet ] .",
    "it is worth noting here that the cardy - ostlund random sine - gordon model  @xcite in @xmath350 , disordered ferromagnets ,  @xcite and ising and vector spin glasses  @xcite were shown to display a dynamic exponent @xmath351 , with @xmath29 of the order of unity and depending on details of the considered model .",
    "our arguments and numerical study show that the numerically measured dynamic exponent could simply be an effective value that stems from the interpolation of two growth regimes that can not be properly resolved numerically .",
    "this seems to be particularly important for systems with a positive energy exponent @xmath206 , since in general we expect @xmath352 , and therefore a crossover from a thermally dominated short - time regime to a long - time dynamics dominated by diverging energetic barriers .",
    "the temperature dependence of the effective exponent in the regime of logarithmic growth , @xmath305 , can be explained with a similar argument . by equating eq .",

    "such that the restriction @xmath363 is still satisfied one finds @xmath364 .",
    "indeed , @xmath356 is a decreasing function of @xmath52 .",
    "these results are consistent with the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta - fit ] , where we observe that @xmath364 at low temperatures , and @xmath365 increasing the temperature .",
    "the effective exponent analysis made above reveals that crossover induced effects are controlled by the order of magnitude of @xmath366 .",
    "since @xmath154 in a simulation is always a fraction of the system size @xmath41 , a temperature dependence of the effective exponents can be expected for systems such that @xmath367 .",
    "for instance , in order to properly resolve the dynamic exponent @xmath36 at short length scales we need @xmath306 for at least a few orders of magnitude range of @xmath154 , _",
    "i.e. _ a large @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "to properly resolve the exponent @xmath205 we need @xmath368 for @xmath369 for at least a few orders of magnitude of @xmath154 .",
    "typically , the largest systems analyzed numerically in the literature have @xmath370 , with @xmath371 and do not satisfy the latter constraint .",
    "this clearly prompts for a careful interpretation of the anomalous temperature dependence of power - law or logarithmic growth exponents obtained numerically so far , as we discuss below .    in ref .",
    "the relaxation of an elastic line in a disordered potential was analyzed for the particular case @xmath117 and @xmath180 .",
    "the crossover to the logarithmic growth was observed , though with an effective exponent @xmath372 . in ref .   scaling arguments for the free energy of droplet excitations",
    "were given favoring the value @xmath373 , against the commonly accepted value @xmath374 ,  @xcite in apparent agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "in the present work we find @xmath375 for @xmath117 and @xmath180 , consistent with the result of ref .  , but",
    "also a decrease towards a value close to @xmath376 with temperature .",
    "this behavior is opposite to what is proposed in ref .  , where entropic effects leading to the value @xmath373 are expected to grow with @xmath52 , from the @xmath211 value @xmath377 , to the entropically - driven value @xmath373 .",
    "the scaling arguments given above thus show that the anomalous temperature dependence of @xmath378 can still be interpreted without dropping the @xmath377 identification , which was proposed time ago .",
    "@xcite    in numerical simulations of the steady - state slow driven motion of an elastic line  @xcite the effective creep exponent @xmath379 was found to be temperature dependent . according to the assumption @xmath380 at large length - scales , simple scaling arguments lead to @xmath381 ( see , for instance ref .  ) .",
    "taking into account that @xmath371 in those simulations we can expect , following an equivalent line of reasoning as above , a temperature dependent effective creep exponent @xmath382 , such that @xmath383 when @xmath52 grows .",
    "this behavior is in good qualitative agreement with the results in ref .  .",
    "therefore , the anomalous temperature dependence observed in ref .   can not be used as evidence against obtaining the creep exponent entirely as a function of static exponents , although the large scale geometry in the creep regime is found to be described by depinning exponents .",
    "elastic manifolds are objects that appear in a large variety of problems with glassy features . it was shown in the past that these systems present aspects of glassy dynamics combined with diffusion properties .",
    "@xcite    after a series of analytic and numerical studies of continuous and discrete models with and without quenched disorder we can summarize the main features of the out of equilibrium relaxation of individual and interacting directed one - dimensional objects .",
    "all these systems age below a characteristic temperature @xmath110 . in the mean - field limit of an infinite number of transverse dimensions , for a line with infinite length ,",
    "a dynamic phase transition arise at @xmath110 . below @xmath110 the lines age without diffusion .",
    "@xcite    the dynamics of finite length lines moving in finite dimensional spaces cross over from diffusive - aging growth to a regime in which the roughness saturates .",
    "this phenomenon can be described with a generalization of the family - vicsek scaling .",
    "@xcite the qualitative features of the two - time freely relaxing observables are generic and do not depend on the presence of quenched randomness but the details such as the exponents and growing length do .",
    "we performed a careful analysis of the time - dependent growing length and we found a crossover from an effective power - law with temperature dependent exponent to the expected asymptotic logarithmic growth for sufficiently long strings .",
    "our numerical data indicates a temperature dependent effective barrier exponent @xmath356 , which is higher than the energy exponent @xmath208 at low temperatures , but tends to it at high temperatures , provided the system is large enough to display the asymptotic behavior . as we discussed via scaling arguments this behavior can be recast in terms of crossover induced effects , and it is not inconsistent with the usual assumption @xmath384 for this system .",
    "we also found a single crossover length @xmath0 separating a thermally dominated regime with @xmath136 and a disorder dominated regime with the @xmath211 roughness exponent @xmath385 .",
    "we showed that this is consistent with the assumption that large scale properties of the system are indistinguishable from those at @xmath211 .",
    "translating this crossover into the dynamics we could also describe the temperature dependence of the effective dynamical exponents in the power - law growth regime , and in the logarithmic growth regime . in this respect",
    "it would be important to study the corresponding crossover in @xmath386 dimensions , relevant for vortices in superconductors .",
    "this is crucial for high - tc superconductors where thermal fluctuations are known to strongly renormalize the disorder and produce larkin lengths growing exponentially fast with temperature .",
    "@xcite as the larkin length marks the onset of metastability and the crossover to a barrier dominated ( random - manifold ) regime , as it does @xmath114 in our case , we can expect the phenomenology and crossover induced effects we describe here to be experimentally relevant , specially at the onset of irreversibility , near the transition to the vortex liquid phase ,  @xcite where the larkin length can become comparable with the sample size .",
    "@xcite    the importance of measuring linear responses was demonstrated by the fact that all known coarsening systems ( above their lower critical dimension ) have an asymptotically vanishing linear response in the aging regime , in contrast to solvable mean - field glassy models and numerical simulations of finite dimensional glasses that yield a finite integrated linear response in the same two - times regime ( see _ e.g. _ refs .   and ) .",
    "this fact appears as a concrete difference between the relaxation dynamics of coarsening and glassy systems .",
    "the relaxation of the integrated thermal averaged linear response of elastic manifolds strongly depends on the presence or absence of quenched disorder .",
    "mean - field elastic manifold models in quenched random environments have a fully aging linear response .",
    "the clean ew line has a _ stationary _ linear response while the dirty continuous or lattice models have integrated linear responses with aging and diffusion combined .",
    "the effective temperature  @xcite defined from the comparison of induced and spontaneous averaged fluctuations is _ finite _ in all the cases considered as long as the diffusive factors in the correlations and linear responses are divided away .",
    "we also showed that the effective temperature is higher than the bath temperature for cooling procedures and , inversely , it is lower than the bath temperature for heating procedures .",
    "this is similar to what has been previously found in the @xmath281 xy model  @xcite and the edwards - wilkinson elastic line  @xcite and gives support to the notion of effectvie temperature as measured from deviations from the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the study of dynamic fluctuations in these systems has not been fully developed yet . in ref .",
    "we analyzed the fluctuations of the two - time roughness of the lattice disordered model during growth .",
    "the equilibrium  @xcite and out of equilibrium  @xcite roughness fluctuations in the ew line show a similar pattern .",
    "the probability distribution functions in all these models satisfy a scaling law and the scaling function follows the same trend as a function of all its variables .",
    "the question then arises as to whether the fluctuations of the linear responses of clean and disordered elastic lines are similar or different .",
    "we shall discuss this problem in a separate publication .",
    "the relation with the theory of fluctuations based on time - reparametrization invariance  @xcite will also be discussed elsewhere .",
