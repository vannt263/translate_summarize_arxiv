    "analysis of halo concentrations is done for different populations of halos .",
    "we limit our analysis to halos containing more than 500 particles .",
    "most of the time we analyze all such halos regardless of their degree of virialization or interaction . occasionally we select only `` relaxed '' halos .",
    "a number of parameters is involved in this selection .",
    "we define an offset parameter @xmath59 as the distance between the center of a halo ( density maximum with the deepest gravitational potential ) and the center of mass of the halo in units of the virial radius . for each halo",
    "we also use the spin parameter @xmath60 and the virial ratio @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the total kinetic and potential energies .",
    "a halo is called `` relaxed '' if it satisfies the following three conditions : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give detailed discussion of these conditions .",
    "there are different ways to estimate halo concentration",
    ". traditionally it is done first by fitting a nfw profile @xmath67 to the spherically averaged density profile of a halo , where @xmath68 and @xmath13 are the characteristic density and radius .",
    "then the halo concentration is found as the ratio of the virial radius to the characteristic radius @xmath13 : @xmath69 however , the fitting can be difficult .",
    "for example , special attention should be paid to the central region : if fitting starts too close to the center where the resolution is not sufficient , the fitting will produce too low concentration because the density in the center is underestimated .",
    "in addition to the problems with the center and the necessity to deal with binned data , direct fitting has another feature : it heavily relies on an assumption of a particular shape of the halo profile , which is typically taken as the nfw profile .",
    "halo profiles on average show systematic deviations from the nfw approximation and are better approximated with the einasto profile @xcite .",
    "one may naively expect that fitting a more accurate approximation would produce better results on concentrations .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "there is a reason why halo concentrations are not estimated with the einasto profile : results show large fluctuations in the concentration , which are due to a smaller curvature of density profile @xmath70 in the crucial range of radii around the radius with the logarithmic slope -2 .",
    "these weaknesses of the direct fitting provide a motivation to look for alternatives .",
    "the idea is to start with the nfw profile .",
    "it is uniquely defined by the characteristic density @xmath68 and the characteristic radius @xmath13 . instead of these two parameters",
    "one can use any two independent quantities to define the profile .",
    "for example , one can choose the virial radius and the radius at which the circular velocity reaches half of its maximum value as in @xcite . or one can use the radius containing 1/5 of virial mass and the virial mass @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite proposed to use a relation between the maximum circular velocity @xmath71 , the virial mass and the virial radius to estimate the halo concentration .",
    "we follow this idea and use a more simple version with parameters @xmath33 and the circular velocity at the virial radius : @xmath72 in this case the ratio @xmath73 of the maximum circular velocity   to the virial velocity 200   is directly related with the halo concentration and can easily be interpreted because larger ratios imply larger concentration .",
    "the value of the halo concentration can be estimated by assuming a shape of the density profile . however , this is not required because the velocity ratio is a measure of the halo concentration regardless of what profiles halos have .",
    "for the case of the nfw halo density profile , the @xmath73 velocity ratio is given by the following relation : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is @xmath76 having the @xmath73 ratio for each halo , we find the halo concentration @xmath9 by solving numerically eqs .",

    "we find quite a good agreement of our estimates of @xmath9 with the results of direct fitting of halo profiles by @xcite with the deviations between the two methods being less than 5 percent for the whole range of masses in the ms simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] shows six examples of fitting density profiles of large halos with @xmath83 in the bolshoi simulation .",
    "each of the halos is resolved with more than a million particles and the random noise associated with finite number of particles is practically negligible .",
    "we use 30 radial bins equally spaced in logarithm of radius with @xmath84 up to @xmath85 .",
    "plots show typical examples of high and low concentration halos .",
    "just as expected , for halos with smooth density profiles ( the bottom row of panels ) the accuracy of fits obtained with @xmath73 concentrations is very good .",
    "halos with large substructures and big radial fluctuations ( typically halos with low concentration ; the top row of panels ) result in relatively poor fits .",

    "the halos with concentration larger than @xmath89 demonstrate a tight relation between the two estimates of concentration : more than 90 percent of halos fall between two lines : @xmath90 and @xmath91 . at smaller concentrations",

    "these raw data are presented in figures  [ fig : fig3a]-[fig : fig3b ] for all simulations discussed in section  2 . here",
    "we consider only halos with more than 500 particles for our analysis .",
    "error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty in the determination of the @xmath73 median velocity ratio .",
    "halos are binned by @xmath33 , and the average @xmath94 for each velocity bin is the horizontal axis .    at @xmath21 ,",
    "the agreement between both millennium simulations is very good in the range of masses where they overlap .",
    "this is expected if the two simulations faithfully present results of the cosmological model and are not affected by finite box sizes or any other numerical issues .",

    "however , this is not the case : ms - i has larger concentration for overlapping masses .",
    "an important aspect that could cause this discrepancy is the fact that substructure within the dominant ( distinct ) halo is not taken into account when @xmath33 is computed .",

    "however , the fast growth of the halos in the upturn does change the structure of the most massive halos ( even those that are `` relaxed '' ) .",

    "<S> the concentration @xmath3 as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern . </S>",
    "<S> however , when expressed in terms of the linear @xmath4 fluctuation of the density field @xmath5 , the halo concentration @xmath6 shows a nearly - universal simple u - shaped behaviour with a minimum at a well defined scale at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> yet , some small dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain . at the high - mass end ( @xmath8 ) </S>",
    "<S> the median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly radial orbits . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath9@xmath5 relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass . when applied to galaxy clusters , our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger  by a factor up to 1.5  than previous results from smaller simulations , and are in much better agreement with results of observations .    </S>",
