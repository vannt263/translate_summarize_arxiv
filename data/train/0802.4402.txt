    "many modern polymer materials consist of multiple components.@xcite while the material appears homogeneous on a macroscopic length scale , the different constituents often do not mix microscopically ; domains of micrometer size form and they are separated by internal interfaces .",
    "the properties of these materials arise from a complex interplay between the characteristics of the individual components in the bulk and interfacial properties.@xcite    therefore , abiding interest has been directed towards investigating inhomogeneous polymer systems , e.g. , surfaces of polymeric materials and polymer - solid contacts , interfaces in homopolymer blends , or microphase - separated morphologies in block copolymers . computer simulations",
    "are an ideal tool to provide simultaneous insights into ( i ) the molecular conformations of the long flexible macromolecules at interfaces or surfaces , ( ii ) thermodynamic or mechanical properties ( e.g. , interfacial tension ) and ( iii ) the single - chain dynamics in the inhomogeneous environment and the kinetics of structure formation .",
    "the simulation of large systems of long chain molecules , however , poses computational challenges and alternative approaches , like the self - consistent field theory or polymer density functional theory , have been successfully applied to study inhomogeneous polymer systems.@xcite these mean - field techniques approximate the problem of interacting chains by the much simpler one of a single molecule in an external field that , in turn , mimics the interactions with its surrounding .",
    "thus , significantly larger systems of longer chains can be described by mean - field theory than by computer simulations . in dense systems of long flexible molecules",
    "the mean - field approach yields a rather accurate description of long wave length properties.@xcite the accuracy has been demonstrated by mapping the representations used in mean - field theories and computer simulations and quantitatively comparing the results of both techniques.@xcite in particular , the mean - field theory provides an excellent , quantitative description of the molecular conformations in an inhomogeneous system",
    ".    given an accurate mapping between the representations used in mean - field theories and computer simulations , it is tempting to utilize the information gained by mean - field theory to generate large , equilibrated multi - chain conformations that can be studied by computer simulations ( e.g. , to investigate the local dynamics of the molecules at an interface).@xcite however , there is a rather fundamental problem : the _ mean - field theory ignores all intermolecular correlations _ ,",
    "i.e. approximating the multi - chain system by that of a single chain in an external field , all information about the relative distances between molecules is lost .    in order to illustrate this problem",
    "let us consider the simpler case of a homogeneous dense polymer melt where the predictions of the mean - field theory are trivial .",
    "within mean - field theory the chain conformations are unperturbed .",
    "if one generated single - chain conformations according to the pre - defined bulk distribution and placed them randomly into a simulation cell , the resulting multi - chain configuration would not represent a dense melt at all .",
    "the collective structure function of density correlations would be identical to the single - chain structure factor and the compressibility would be that of an ideal gas of chains rather than adopting the low value characteristic for a dense polymer liquid.@xcite likewise , the correlations between segments belonging to different molecules would be trivial instead of exhibiting a correlation hole that is the hallmark of intermolecular pair correlations in a melt.@xcite since the spatial extent of the correlation hole is long - ranged , the chains have to diffuse a distance of the order of their end - to - end distance , @xmath0 , in order to build - up the intermolecular correlations . the necessary time , @xmath1 , increases with chain length and much of the benefit of using the information of the mean - field theory would be lost .",
    "moreover , the correlation hole of the intermolecular correlation function also gives rise to important , long - ranged intramolecular correlations in semi - dilute solutions @xcite and melts@xcite that can be observed in the power - law decay of the bond - bond correlation function along the chain contour@xcite or a hump in the kratky - plateau of the single - chain structure factor.@xcite it is important to emphasize that both , intra- and intermolecular correlations on the scale @xmath0 do not explicitly depend on the strength of the excluded volume interactions or the details of the interaction potentials but are determined by the polymer density and chain extension.@xcite    problems due to randomly placing gaussian chains in a simulation box have already been observed.@xcite it was found that after randomly placing chains in a simulation cell and equilibrating the resulting multi - chain configuration by molecular dynamics simulations , the chain conformations initially swell and a time of the order of the rouse time , @xmath1 , is required to achieve equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , auhl _ et al .",
    "_  demonstrated that if the chains are placed in the simulation box such that the density is uniform , much of the swelling of the conformations will be avoided and equilibrium will be achieved faster.@xcite    in the present work , we test the hypothesis that the incompressibility constraint , i.e. the strong reduction of long wave length density fluctuations in a dense polymeric fluid , is sufficient to generate the intermolecular correlations that are ignored by mean - field theory . to this end",
    ", we adopt the packing algorithm of auhl and co - workers @xcite for homogeneous systems and apply it to a thin polymer film confined between two structureless solid substrates .",
    "this simple spatially inhomogeneous system serves as a testing bed because it has been studied by a variety of self - consistent field and polymer density functional theory approaches.@xcite the method can be readily generalized to other types of inhomogeneities .",
    "moreover , rather than using gaussian chain conformations , we employ single - chain conformations that are extracted from an equilibrated melt.@xcite these conformations are not strictly gaussian on large length scales but they already include the non - trivial long - ranged intramolecular correlations .    the manuscript is arranged as follows : in the next section [ model ] , we describe the coarse - grained polymer model , the simulation techniques and the packing algorithm . in sec .",

    "the strategy of the packing algorithm consists in reducing local fluctuations of the segment density without corrupting the intramolecular correlations .",

    "our packing algorithm does not aim at generating this short - ranged fluid ordering because this local structure on the segmental scale equilibrates on time scales that are fast compared to the rouse time of the macromolecules . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of the solid substrate influences the polymer structure over distances up to the molecular size . in this region  denoted interphase ",
    "the polymer chains align with the solid substrate , the back - folding of the conformations deepens the correlation hole of the intermolecular pair correlation function and the density of the molecules center - of - masses depends non - trivially on the distance from the solid substrate .",
    "these effects have to be captured by the packing algorithm because their equilibration requires the molecules to diffuse a distance of the order of the molecular extension and the concomitant time scale is set by the rouse - time.@xcite    our packing algorithm requires ( i ) equilibrated single - chain conformations of a bulk system that do incorporate the non - trivial long - ranged intramolecular correlations imparted by the incompressibility constraint and ( ii ) the distribution of the single - chain conformations in the spatially inhomogeneous system .",
    "the latter property can be obtained with high accuracy by self - consistent field or polymer density functional calculations evaluating the single - chain partition function via a partial enumeration over a large ensemble of bulk single - chain conformations .    in order to assess the quality of the packing algorithm , however , we adopt in the following a different procedure that does not invoke the additional approximations of the self - consistent field or polymer density functional calculations .",
    "we equilibrate a dense polymer melt in the presence of the solid substrate . this equilibrated multi - chain configuration serves ( i ) as a reference to which we compare the result of the packing process and ( ii ) it provides _ exact _ information about the distribution of single - chain conformations in the spatially inhomogeneous system .",
    "we extract single - chain conformations at a given distance from the spatial inhomogeneity from equilibrated melt configurations ( at different times ) and our packing algorithm re - assembles them to a multi - chain configuration .",
    "therefore , the deviations of the multi - chain configuration from the equilibrated melt solely stem from the packing algorithm .    in the first stage",
    ", we generated an initial multi - chain configuration by randomly drawing equilibrated molecular conformations from a large ensemble of single - chain conformations .",
    "the distance from the spatial inhomogeneity ( i.e. , the @xmath35-coordinate ) and the orientation of each single - chain conformation in the newly assembled configuration is identical to the value in the equilibrated configuration and the density profiles of both configurations are also statistically identical .",
    "we emphasize that only information about single - chain properties , which can be obtained from a mean - field theory , enter the packing process .",
    "this first stage generates an initial configuration that reproduces the single - chain properties of the equilibrated melt ( e.g. , the molecules center - of - mass distribution ) but the intermolecular correlations parallel to the solid substrate are that of an ideal gas of polymers .    in the following packing procedure ,",
    "single - chain conformations are treated as rigid bodies ( i.e. , the intramolecular correlations are frozen ) and the distance to the ( nearest ) solid substrate as well as the orientation of the molecule is kept fixed . in order to introduce intermolecular correlations in the direction parallel to the spatial inhomogeneity ,",
    "we minimize local density fluctuations . to this end",

    "the strongest deviations from equilibrium occur at @xmath133 and they are smaller than @xmath134 .",
    "larger scales ( larger values of @xmath118 ) show smaller deviations which decay exponentially in time . after roughly @xmath135 , the deviations are smaller than @xmath136 on all length scales and we consider the intramolecular correlations as being equilibrated .",

    "[ fig : vergleich ] , we finally compare the temporal evolution of @xmath137 after the first stage of the packing with a configuration generated after the second stage . with a maximal deviation from the equilibrium distribution of @xmath138 at @xmath139 after the first stage ,",
    "the intramolecular correlations are much stronger perturbed and also occur on slightly larger values of @xmath118 than in the configuration after the second stage .",
    "but even worse , these deviations in the configuration after the first stage propagate to larger length scales and therefore increase the required relaxation time significantly .",
    "comparison of the temporal evolution of @xmath137 between an initial configuration generated by the packing algorithm ( left ) and a randomly packed configuration ( first stage , right ) for some fixed time steps @xmath131 ( @xmath122 ) . ]",
    "we have investigated the properties of a packing algorithm based on an idea by auhl and co - workers @xcite that arranges given single - chain conformations extracted from an inhomogeneous polymer melt in order to generate a multi - chain configuration , which can serve as a starting configuration for a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the data demonstrate that reducing local density fluctuations , which are quantified by the average number of segments that surround a reference bead , we are able to re - establish intermolecular correlations on the length scale of the molecules extension , @xmath0 .",
    "most prominently , the packing algorithm generates the correlation hole in the intermolecular pair correlation function .    in order to assess the quality of the packing algorithm",
    ", we utilize single - chain conformations extracted from an equilibrated thin polymer film .",
    "the so - generated single - chain properties are exact by construction . in practice ,",
    "mean - field techniques that evaluate the single - chain partition function via a partial enumeration over a large ensemble of equilibrated single - chain conformations of the bulk will provide an excellent approximation for the single - chain properties in an inhomogeneous system .",
    "since the single - chain conformations are extracted from the bulk they already incorporate the long - ranged intramolecular correlations that the incompressibility constraint imparts on the conformations ( e.g. , the power - law decay of the bond - bond correlation function along the molecule ) .",
    "the local fluid - like packing structure on the length scale of the excluded volume screening length is not reproduced by the packing algorithm .",
    "this local structure , however , can be established on a short time scale compared to the relaxation time of the inter- and intramolecular correlations on the scale @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the algorithm is particularly useful for creating initial configurations for particle - based simulations of inhomogeneous polymer melts or semi - dilute solutions on the basis of mean - field results .",
    "there remain two problems to be addressed : ( i ) for inhomogeneous melts of very long chains , even the generation of equilibrated bulk configurations is a computational challenge.@xcite gaussian chain conformations , however , are inappropriate because the long - ranged intramolecular correlations require protracted long times to equilibrate .",
    "instead of drawing long polymers directly from an equilibrated melt it might be feasible to generate appropriate conformations by joining short chains @xcite accounting for the weak effective intramolecular interactions @xcite due to the incompressibility .",
    "this proposed procedure is very similar to the analytical perturbation calculations performed by @xcite and we expect it to reproduce the non - trivial long - ranged intramolecular correlations .",
    "@xcite these single - chain conformations can be used as a starting point for mean - field calculations of inhomogeneous systems and the results of the latter serve as input into the packing algorithm .",
    "\\(ii ) we have applied the packing algorithm to a polymer melt with the simplest inhomogeneity , i.e. a thin polymer film confined by symmetric solid substrates .",
    "we emphasize that the packing procedure can be readily generalized to more complicated geometries .",
    "the moves , which are utilized to arrange the single - chain conformations during the packing process , must not alter the single - chain properties ( i.e. , the intramolecular structure and the position and orientation with respect to the spatial inhomogeneity ) .",
    "thus , in the case , where translational invariance is broken in all three spatial directions , only replacement moves are acceptable but no translations or rotations .",
