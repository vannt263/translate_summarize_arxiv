    "weak decays of heavy flavored hadrons are an excellent laboratory to study the standard model . in particular",
    "b meson decays provide a wealth of information on the quark mixing elements .",
    "while the next generation of high luminosity facilities have a good chance to measure @xmath2 asymmetries in these decays and perhaps shed some light on the puzzling and fundamental phenomenon of @xmath2 violation , good progress in measuring some parameters describing quark mixing has been achieved .    in the framework of the standard model the gauge bosons , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 couple to mixtures of the physical @xmath6 and @xmath7 states .",
    "this mixing is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix : @xmath8 a commonly used approximate parameterization was originally proposed by wolfenstein @xcite .",
    "it reflects the hierarchy between the magnitude of matrix elements belonging to different diagonals .",
    "the 3 diagonal elements and the 2 elements just above the diagonal are real and positive .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath9    @xmath0 decays probe several of these matrix elements .",
    "the study of semileptonic decays allows the measurement of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath12 is considered a promising avenue to measure the ratio @xmath13 @xcite .    the standard model parameterization of the quark mixing via the ckm matrix element accomodates a complex phase , and therefore offers a natural way to model the intriguing phenomenon of @xmath2 violation .",
    "so far this violation has been measured only in neutral @xmath14 decays , and yet it may very well be at the origin of the matter dominated universe that exists now",
    ".    the ckm matrix must be unitary and the relation between elements of different rows dictated by this property can be graphically represented as so called ` unitarity triangles ' .",
    "[ ckm_tri ] shows the most promising of the triangles : the angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath4 are all related to the single phase in the @xmath17 matrix element .",
    "the study of @xmath0 decays will eventually allow the measurements of all the three angles .",
    "thus , it will pose a serious challenge to the standard model description of cp violation and perhaps shed some light on phenomenology beyond the standard model .",
    "the statistical accuracy corresponding to the present data sample accumulated with the cleo detector , about 3.5 @xmath18 for the results presented in this paper , is not yet sufficient to probe @xmath2 violation in @xmath0 decays or to measure rare decays like @xmath19 accurately , but is adequate to give extremely valuable information on the matrix elements @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these data allow us to put better constraints on the fundamental parameters in two major ways .",
    "on one hand , the measurements reported in this paper provide new information that reduces the experimental errors on the parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental data provide constraints to the theoretical models that are needed to relate measured observables to the fundamental parameters of the standard model .",
    "in addition , heavy flavored meson decays are a laboratory to probe the strong interaction in different dynamical domains .",
    "@xmath0 meson decays probe a regime not fully amenable to perturbative qcd calculations , but suitable for the application of effective theories derived from qcd in some asymptotic conditions . in particular , an approach that has generated a lot of interest in the last few years is the so called ` heavy quark effective theory ' ( hqet ) @xcite , where the asymptotic behavior corresponds to taking the limit @xmath22 . new data shedding some light on the hadronic matrix element will be discussed .",
    "the ckm parameters  and  have been studied extensively by the cleo collaboration through the study of semileptonic decays @xmath23 .",
    "the experimental study of semileptonic decays has addressed both inclusive measurements , where the recoiling hadronic state is not identified , and exclusive measurements , where the recoiling hadron is reconstructed through one of its decay channels .",
    "inclusive decays have provided several interesting results .",
    "most notably the study of the end ",
    "point of the lepton spectrum , where no charmed hadron final states are kinematically allowed , has provided the first conclusive evidence of a non zero value of  @xcite .",
    "exclusive decays provide complementary information .",
    "in particular the semileptonic channel more extensively studied so far is @xmath24 .",
    "this channel is attractive from an experimental point of view because the slow @xmath25 emitted in the decay @xmath26 provides a unique signature of this hadronic final state .",
    "in addition , a sharpened attention to this decay has been prompted by the suggestion @xcite from hqet that its study provides a ` model independent ' method to determine .",
    "the arguments for this claim will be discussed below .",
    "the decay @xmath27 is interesting for several reasons .",
    "analyses similar those for the decay @xmath28 provide ways to understand the systematic uncertainty in the extraction of the parameter .    the hadronic matrix element involved in this decay , the main source of uncertainty in extracting  from the experimental data , is probed effectively by the differential decay width @xmath29 :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath0 and @xmath33 meson momenta respectively , @xmath34 is the invariant mass of the lepton - neutrino pair and @xmath14 is the @xmath33 momentum in the @xmath0 rest frame and is given by : @xmath35 - 4\\frac{m_d^2q^2}{m_b^4}\\right\\}^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    @xmath36 is the form factor describing the hadronic interaction and must be extracted from theory .",
    "most quark model calculations assume a @xmath34 dependence for the form factor and predict the normalization at a given kinematic point .",
    "the normalization factor is calculated either at @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "in general the arbitrariness of the assumed @xmath34 dependence is a reason for some concern , but in this specific decay the @xmath34 range is not very big and therefore we would not expect a strong model dependence .",
    "cleo has recently studied the decay @xmath39 with two different techniques @xcite . in the first method only the lepton and the @xmath33 candidates in the final state are found , using the decay @xmath40 . because the @xmath41 pairs are produced nearly at rest , the missing mass squared @xmath42 is calculated as : @xmath43 here the approximation consists of assuming @xmath44 , relying upon the low magnitude of the @xmath0 momentum because of the vicinity of the   to the threshold for @xmath41 meson production .",
    "the second approach exploits the hermeticity of the cleo ii detector and infers the @xmath45 momentum from a full reconstruction of the semileptonic decay .",
    "stringent cuts need to be applied in this case to insure that no other sources of missing 4-momentum , like additional @xmath46 s or @xmath47 s , are present in the event .    in the former analysis",
    ", the @xmath42 distribution of candidate events containing a @xmath48 and an opposite sign lepton is studied in 6 different @xmath34 bins gev@xmath49 , evenly spaced between 0 and 12 gev@xmath49 .",
    "[ mkpipi ] shows the @xmath50 invariant mass for the interval @xmath51 .",
    "one of the crucial elements of this analysis is an accurate background estimate .",
    "several sources are subtracted directly , using independent control samples . in particular",
    ", a major background is the decay @xmath52 , where the @xmath53 decays into the final state @xmath54 .",
    "this component is subtracted by measuring the @xmath42 distribution for identified @xmath52 decays , rescaled by the ratio in detection and reconstruction efficiency for the two channels . the data sample remaining after direct background subtraction has two components : the signal final state @xmath55 and final states of the kind @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a hadronic final state not coming from the @xmath58 mode discussed above .",
    "this last background is subtracted by fitting its contribution with the shape given by a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the results of the fit in several @xmath34 bins is shown in fig .",
    "[ allqsq ] .",
    "note that in different @xmath34 bins the relative weight of signal and background is quite different .",
    "therefore the study of the @xmath42 in different @xmath34 regions is quite effective in isolating the signal from this last background contribution .",
    "the second technique reconstructs the @xmath46 four  vector by summing all the charged track and photon momenta in the event .",
    "since the total energy in the event is equal to the center of mass energy and the total momentum is zero , the @xmath46 is assumed to have energy equal to the difference between center of mass energy and total reconstructed energy and momentum equal and opposite to the reconstructed momentum . in order to achieve adequate resolution ,",
    "stringent event selection criteria are applied to avoid smearing due to additional undetected neutral particles or particles outside the detector acceptance .",
    "consistency between the reconstructed energy and momentum is required .",
    "once @xmath59 is estimated , the @xmath0 meson candidate can be reconstructed with the usual procedure for exclusive hadronic final states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dplnunu ] .",
    "the @xmath42 technique gives a branching fraction of @xmath60% , the @xmath46 reconstruction technique gives @xmath61% with a combined ( preliminary ) branching fraction of @xmath62% .",
    "the statistical errors in these two techniques are essentially uncorrelated , while the systematic error is strongly correlated .    the @xmath34 distribution for the @xmath42 method is shown in fig .  [ qsq_dp ] .",
    "the intercept at @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "the curve is fitted to the functional form : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the normalization at @xmath37 , and @xmath67 is the mass of the pole .",
    "the quark model calculations predict @xmath66 , and the pole corresponds the vector meson exchanged in the t - channel , in this case the @xmath68 .",
    "the data are fitted including both @xmath66 and @xmath67 as fit parameters , except in the case of the model developed by demchuck _",

    ", @xcite , @xcite are given in table 1 . even if this study considers only a restricted set of models , the limited range of @xmath34 spanned by this decay makes the results quite general .",
    "the first errors in the average value of  is the quadrature of the statistical and systematic errors in the data and the fact that the fraction of neutral @xmath69 final state produced at the  is known only as @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the second error is due only to model dependence .",
    "the same data can be used to extract  with a different method , inspired by hqet . in this approach",
    "the relevant dynamical variable is the velocity transfer @xmath71 , related to @xmath34 by : @xmath72 the point @xmath73 corresponds to the situation where the @xmath0 decays to a @xmath33 at rest in the @xmath0 frame .",
    "[ dphqet ] shows the experimental data for @xmath74 .",
    "in particular it can be seen that it is difficult to ascertain the curvature of the isgur - wise universal function because of the low statistics at the points close to @xmath73 and thus the uncertainty in the extraction of  must reflect this additional uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the fit to these data gives @xmath75 .",
    "in addition to the measurement discussed in this paper , the parameter  has been studied experimentally with several different methods .",
    "many groups have reported their findings for the branching fraction @xmath76  @xcite and related their measurement to several different theoretical models to extract their estimate of .",
    "in addition this decay can be studied with the hqet method discussed above @xcite .",
    "this approach has a special interest from the point of view of hqet theorists because luke s theorem @xcite states that for @xmath73 , the mass dependent corrections vanish to first order and therefore the first non  zero term occurs with power @xmath77 .",
    "this implies that for a well behaved perturbative expansion , these corrections should play a minor role and thus allow an extraction of  prone to smaller theoretical uncertainty .",
    "lastly , the inclusive semileptonic decay can be related to  @xcite .",
    "the average values of  obtained with these techniques are shown in fig .",
    "[ vcb ] . the average value @xmath78 , corresponding to the value for the @xmath17 parameter @xmath79 , has been obtained by adding statistical and systematic errors in the various estimates linearly and then adding the different methods in quadrature .",
    "this procedure is by no means rigorous but it should give a conservative estimate of the final errors .      the first evidence of a non - zero  was obtained by cleo i @xcite , by studying inclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "they reported an excess of leptons beyond the kinematic endpoint for the decay @xmath39 .",
    "this result was quickly confirmed by argus @xcite and then studied in more detail and with better statistical accuracy by cleo ii @xcite .",
    "there are two crucial issues that make the extraction of  from experimental data trickier than the extraction of .",
    "first of all , in this case we have the possibility of light hadronic systems recoiling against the lepton@xmath45 pair .",
    "therefore the @xmath34 domain spanned by these decays is much bigger and the assumed @xmath34 dependence of the form factors strongly affects the predicted rate @xmath80 and fraction of high momentum leptons @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , there is some uncertainty on the composition of the hadronic system recoiling against the lepton-@xmath45 pair .",
    "consequently models that focus on a few exclusive hadronic final states are not likely to give reliable predictions for @xmath80 , as it is quite unlikely that the whole dalitz plot is dominated by the low lying resonances . on the contrary , ` inclusive ' models , like the one proposed by altarelli et a. ( accmm ) @xcite , based upon a quark - hadron duality picture , become more relevant when several final states are involved .",
    "the importance of the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of this parameter is illustrated by the fact that the cleo ii estimate of  changed by a factor of two depending upon the model used @xcite . the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of this parameter is closely related to the @xmath34 dependence of the form factors , as shown by artuso @xcite , by comparing the accmm and isgw @xcite predictions for the @xmath34 distributions .",
    "recently n. isgur and d. scora have revised the isgw model , aiming at making it more realistic at high   and using some constraints on the form factors derived from hqet .",
    "this model , referred to as isgw ii @xcite , is now much closer to accmm in several respects .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ qsq ] shows the the predicted  distribution of events with leptons in the momentum range of 2.4 to 2.6 gev / c ( the interval adopted in the cleo ii analysis leading to the most precise value of  available so far ) .",
    "it can be seen that the  distribution predicted by isgw ii is much softer than the one expected by isgw .",
    "it is obvious that in order to reduce the errors on the estimate of the parameter   it is necessary to enlarge the set of experimental observables .",
    "in particular the study of exclusive channels is the necessary first step to check in more detail different theoretical predictions .",
    "cleo has recently measured the branching fractions for exclusive charmless semileptonic decays involving a @xmath25 , @xmath82 or @xmath83 meson in the final state @xcite .",
    "both charged and neutral @xmath0 decays have been studied .",
    "the experimental technique adopted relies again upon the @xmath45 energy and momentum estimates from the rest of the event .",
    "the @xmath45 invariant mass squared is calculated from the reconstructed @xmath84 and @xmath85 as @xmath86 and the selection criterion @xmath87 is subsequently applied .",
    "this approach allows to reconstruct these decays with the techniques developed to study exclusive @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "[ xlnu ] shows the beam constrained invariant mass @xmath88 , evaluated as : @xmath89    in the study of hadronic final states involving @xmath90 in the final system it is often difficult to prove that this system is indeed prevalently @xmath82 .",

    "[ rholnu ] .",
    "they also show the @xmath92 case , which can not be @xmath82 . in the latter case",
    "they see a flat background , while the former distribution show some peaking at the expected nominal resonance mass . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath93 spectrum show little evidence of resonant @xmath83 .",
    "there is clearly the need for more statistics , but this analysis is performed under the assumption that the resonant component is dominant .",
    "the five modes @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 are fitted simultaneously , using the constraints following from isospin : @xmath99 the analysis yields the branching fractions @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the ratio between the partial widths to vector and pseudoscalar final state is interesting because it provides a useful consistency check of the soundness of the assumptions adopted by different phenomenological models .",

    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the corresponding measured values , using the same model to estimate the efficiency corrections .",
    "it can be seen that for some models there is a quite significant discrepancy between the predicted and measured value . in particular the korner and schuler ( ks ) model has only a 0.5% likelihood to be consistent with the data .",

    "the ks model has been excluded from the average as their prediction of the pseudoscalar to vector ratio is inconsistent with the data .",
    "in addition , the isgw model has been replaced by the updated isgw ii model .",
    "the spread in the @xmath104 estimates related to model dependence is now narrowed compared to previous analyses .",
    "it should be noted that the models adopted are now much more similar in their estimate of the @xmath34 dependence of the form factors used and an experimental confirmation of the correctness of this predicted dependence is eagerly awaited .",
    "furthermore , new approaches , based either on qcd sum rule techniques @xcite , @xcite or on lattice qcd @xcite provide new theoretical perspectives on these decay . nonetheless at the present time the model dependence still dominates the errors .",

    "the width of the @xmath107 band is mostly affected by the uncertainties in the wolfenstein parameter @xmath108 , the top quark mass @xmath109 , the charm quark mass @xmath110 and the correction factor for the vacuum insertion approximation @xmath111 .",
    "the width of the   mixing band is dominated by the uncertainty on the @xmath0 meson decay constant @xmath112 here taken to be in the range @xmath113 .",
    "the role of factorization in theoretical predictions on exclusive hadronic decays is multifaceted and has indeed been debated at length . in the early theoretical studies of hadronic heavy flavor decays @xcite , factorization was used as an _ ansatz _ , by assuming that in energetic two body decays direct formation of hadrons by a quark current is a useful approximation and that the two currents ` factorize ' , i.e. the hamiltonian can be expressed as a product of two currents , one which couples a meson in the final state with the decaying one and the other which produces the second meson out of the vacuum @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath115 could be expressed as : @xmath116 there is no good reason why factorization should hold in all two  body hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "however some arguments based on color transparency , originally proposed by bjorken @xcite and later by dugan and grinstein @xcite , make it plausible that decays involving one heavy and one light meson in the final state factorize .",
    "this is because the time scale of interaction between two mesons in the final state is too short to allow appreciable gluon exchange between them .",
    "dugan and grinstein base their arguments on perturbative qcd .",
    "the soundness of their approach has been questioned by aglietti @xcite .",
    "therefore precise experimental tests of factorization in hadronic @xmath0 decays is quite valuable to disentangle this very complex issue .",
    "a factorization test proposed by bjorken is based on the observation that if eq .",
    "13 is valid , then we can related the amplitude @xmath117 to the corresponding matrix element in semileptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "this implies : @xmath118 here @xmath119 is a calculable short distance qcd correction and @xmath120 is the light meson decay constant .",
    "we can use the measured differential decay width @xmath121 reported in this paper with the exclusive branching fractions for @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xcite and use the known @xmath124 and @xmath125 to extract an experimental estimate of the parameter @xmath119 .",
    "the experimental data can be compared with qcd calculations to assess the applicability of factorization to these hadronic decays .",
    "the results of this comparison are shown in table 3 .",
    "it can be seen that the agreement is quite satisfactory .",
    "@xmath0 decays continue to provide a wealth of information on the standard model .",
    "in particular , the detailed study of @xmath0 meson semileptonic decays has given new insights on the quark mixing parameters and on properties of the strong interactions when heavy quarks are involved in the decay .",
    "more detailed studies are forthcoming with the increased luminosity planned for the cleo upgrade and , later , with the  @xmath0 factories and dedicated @xmath0 experiments at hadron machines .",
    "therefore most of the uncertainties related to model dependence will be disentangled and the standard model will have to withstand one of its more substantial challenges .",
