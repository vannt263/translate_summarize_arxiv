    "little string theories with @xmath8 supercharges @xcite are obtained by decoupling limits of the type ii strings near @xmath1 ns5-branes .",
    "they are non - local theories without gravity . depending on whether we start from type iia or iib ns5-branes , the system has @xmath9 or @xmath10 super - poincare symmetry , respectively",
    ". since ns5-branes are one of the most difficult nonperturbative objects to study in string theory , it would be very desirable to have better understanding on these strings . also , the type iia little string theory has interesting low energy limit given by interacting @xmath9 superconformal field theories .",
    "little strings have similarities with critical strings , and also differences .",
    "the fact that it does not contain gravity would be the main difference , with far - reaching implications .",
    "however , being non - local theories , it inherits from the type ii strings various stringy properties , such as the t - duality .",
    "so after circle compactification , the two little string theories are supposed to be t - dual to each other .",
    "unlike critical strings , noncritical little strings are difficult to study . some approaches to study them are : holographic approach @xcite , discrete lightcone quantization @xcite , the double scaling limit @xcite .",
    "in particular , the dlcq approach considers the little string theory compactified on a small circle , in which one studies a sector with definite momentum which is decoupled from the rest . via t - duality , the dlcq description can be obtained by a large radius compactification of the t - dual strings with definite winding number .    in this paper , we study the qfts living on the little strings macroscopically extended on @xmath11 .",
    "they describe 2d decoupled degrees living on these strings at low energy . such theories are studied in detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "one starts from 2d @xmath2 gauge theories , which flow to interacting cfts and describe these strings .",
    "compactifying these strings on large circles , the ground energy is proportional to the radius times the winding quantum number , much larger than the momentum energy scale .",
    "so we can consider a low energy decoupled sector with fixed winding quantum numbers .",
    "they also have direct relevance to the study of dlcq little strings under t - duality , in which the momentum is fixed . in this paper",
    ", we make a modest contribution to constructing such uv theories for the little strings , on the iia side starting from @xmath5 gauge theories .",
    "the system is proposed to flow to a cft with enhanced @xmath12 susy .",
    "compared to the @xmath12 gauge theories discussed in @xcite , the new description has an advantage of manifestly having certain ir symmetries in uv , which is very crucial for computing some protected ir observables such as the elliptic genus .",
    "our @xmath13 uv qfts are similar to those for the self - dual strings of the @xmath9 superconformal field theory , called ` m - strings ' @xcite .    with t - duality , the spectrum of the circle compactified theories would be the same for iia and iib little strings .",
    "we would like to probe this t - duality with the above gauge theory descriptions for macroscopic strings . in general , these descriptions are valid only when the compactification radii are large . as the t - duality exchanges the iia and iib radii as @xmath14 , the two gauge theory descriptions will never be simultaneously reliable .",
    "however , one naturally expects that the protected bps spectrum would be reliable all the way to small radii .    in this paper",
    ", we study the t - duality of little strings in the bps sector , from the uv gauge theory descriptions . in particular ,",
    "being able to compute the elliptic genus indices on both iia and iib sides , thanks to our new gauge theory descriptions , we can directly compare their bps spectra .",
    "we find , in fugacity expansions to highly nontrivial orders , that the two elliptic genera precisely map to each other via t - duality .",
    "ns5-branes and study the massive spectra . ]",
    "apart from confirming the naturally expected t - duality , our finding is establishing a very nontrivial identity between the elliptic genera computed from the type iia and iib sides , so that alternative expressions can be used to extract various properties which would have been very difficult to see from the other viewpoints .",
    "for instance , we explain in section 5 how one can easily understand the @xmath15 transformation properties of the elliptic genus , for the complex structure and kahler parameters of the torus , by using our t - dual expressions for the elliptic genus .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "we explain the 2d gauge theory descriptions of the iib and iia little strings , respectively , and study their elliptic genera . in section 4",
    ", we study the t - duality of the two elliptic genera , as well as extended duality / triality properties . in section 5",
    ", we study the @xmath16 transformation properties of the elliptic genus in various fugacities .",
    "section 6 concludes with brief discussions .",
    "we first consider the type iib little strings , which are the type iib fundamental strings bound to the ns5-branes . at low energy , the world - volume description of iib ns5-branes",
    "is given by 6d maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory , with @xmath10 supersymmetry and @xmath3 gauge group .",
    "the fields consist of the gauge field @xmath17 , 4 scalar fields @xmath18 , and fermions .",
    "these degrees are provided by the d - strings ending on the ns5-branes .",
    "the bosonic symmetry of the theory is @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the lorentz symmetry on the ns5-branes , and @xmath21 is the symmetry on their transverse directions , which rotates @xmath22 .",
    "the yang - mills coupling constant is given by @xmath23 fundamental strings form threshold bounds with the ns5-branes .",
    "they are identified as the instanton strings in the 6d sym .",
    "the instanton string tension is given by @xmath24 agreeing with the tension of the fundamental string .",
    "the coupling constant is independent of the 10d string coupling constant , @xmath25 .",
    "so one can take the little string theory limit , in which we take @xmath26 with fixed @xmath27 .",
    "all the gravitational degrees of freedom are decoupled .",
    "we shall consider @xmath28 macroscopically extended little strings , extended along @xmath11 part of @xmath29 .",

    "the system of @xmath28 f1 and @xmath1 ns5-branes admit a uv gauge theory description given by a @xmath30 gauge theory with @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
