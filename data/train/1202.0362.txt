    "in the study of dynamical systems the artin - mazur zeta function is the generating function for counting periodic points . for any set @xmath8 and map @xmath9",

    "the zeta function is also represented by the product formula @xmath17 where per@xmath18 is the set of periodic points of @xmath12 in @xmath8 and @xmath19 is the least positive @xmath13 such that @xmath20 .",
    "this function was introduced by artin and mazur in the case where @xmath8 is a manifold and @xmath9 is a diffeomorphism  @xcite . in this context @xmath15",
    "is proved to be a rational function for certain classes of diffeomorphisms ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this shows that in these cases the growth of @xmath21 is determined by the finitely many zeros and poles of @xmath22 . from this point",
    "onward we make the definition@xmath23 for economy of notation .",
    "we are interested in the rationality of the zeta function in an algebraic context , motivated by the following example .",
    "* example : * let @xmath8 be a variety over @xmath24 and let @xmath9 be the frobenius map , i.e. the @xmath6-th power map on coordinates .",
    "fix@xmath25 is exactly the set of @xmath26-valued points of @xmath8 .",

    "the points in fix(@xmath11 ) are the roots in @xmath1 of the degree @xmath31 polynomial @xmath32 counted _ without multiplicity _ , so @xmath33 .",
    "if we consider @xmath34 as a function of a complex variable @xmath35 , it converges to a holomorphic function on @xmath36 in a disc around the origin of radius @xmath37 ( at least - it is not clear that @xmath37 is the largest radius of convergence ) .",
    "our motivating question is :    for which @xmath28 $ ] is @xmath38 a rational function ?    if we count periodic points with multiplicity , then @xmath39 for all @xmath13 and question 1 becomes completely trivial by the calculation    @xmath40    so we count each periodic point only once . a partial answer to our question",
