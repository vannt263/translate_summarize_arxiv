    "in particular , both dynamical decoupling  @xcite and dynamically corrected gates ( dcgs )  @xcite are able to perturbatively reduce the effects of classical as well as quantum noise sources , provided that the correlation time scale of the noise is sufficiently long compared to the control time scale at which the noise is `` coherently averaged out .

    "these characteristics may be captured quantitatively in filter - transfer functions ( ffs ) for arbitrary single - qubit control using methods of spectral overlap in the frequency domain  @xcite .",

    "the filter roll - off , captured by the slope of the ff near zero frequency , serves as a lower bound on the order of error suppression in the presence of time - dependent noise @xcite .",
    "this approach has been validated for nontrivial control  including cp constructions  in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "we next proceed to calculate and present independently the ffs for both amplitude and detuning quadratures .",
    "we begin by analyzing the effect of a single noise source , as described by the appropriate generalized ff introduced in the previous section .",
    "results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : pulseff](a ) and [ fig : pulseff](b ) , where we also show , for comparison , ffs for an uncorrected ( elementary or `` primitive '' ) @xmath83 rotation .",
    "as the latter is expected to have no error - suppressing properties , a comparison of the ffs for cp protocols against the primitive rotation reveals their relative performance advantages ; a steeper slope indicates improved ( higher - order ) error suppression .",

    "remarkably , our analysis reveals that the crossover frequency at which the ff for cp protocols becomes larger than that for the primitive is as high as @xmath84 of the driving frequency @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly , in circumstances where the noise power spectral density is dominated by frequencies below this value , cp sequences are still expected to provide robust error - suppressing performance .    for amplitude noise ,",
    "it is possible to make connections between the form of the amplitude ff and geometric models commonly used to describe cps @xcite .",
    "one may represent a compensating sequence as an initial target rotation , followed by correction rotations , captured through a set of vectors in a multi - dimensional space .",
    "direct calculation shows that a sequence correcting dc errors to the first order satisfies the condition : @xmath86 if one treats each term in the above sum as a vector of length @xmath87 pointing in the direction @xmath88 , then placing the vectors end to end forms a _ closed _ figure , demonstrating the effective dc error suppression . in this picture , sk1 yields a triangle , whereas bb1 corresponds to two triangles with opposite - signed area , indicating second - order correction , as expected  @xcite .",

    "this implies that all cps for amplitude noise should have ffs that scale at least as @xmath98 in the limit of small @xmath94 .",

    "we can also use the small-@xmath94 limit of @xmath99 and @xmath100 to estimate the crossover frequency at which the cp ff , @xmath105 , will exceed the primitive pulse ff , @xmath106 .",

    "while these approaches capture the effects of dynamic control noise well , the first - order ff formalism _ underestimates _ error in the region @xmath117 , corresponding to noise processes fluctuating slowly on the scale of operation time .",

    "the generality of this power spectrum in various noise processes allows us to reasonably assume the same power spectrum for both amplitude and detuning noise , despite the fact that these two noise sources have different physical origins in general and , as remarked , we take them to be independent .",
