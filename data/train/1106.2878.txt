    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are a major tracer and a component of stellar populations in galaxies due to their well defined photometric , chemical , and physical properties .",
    "their color is mostly @xmath8 , their metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath9 , and their half - light radius is usually @xmath10 pc @xcite .",
    "these properties of gcs are known to be universal regardless of the morphological type of galaxies .",
    "advancement of observational studies , however , have revealed the existence of ` unusual ' gc populations .",
    "some examples include extremely luminous and large gcs such as @xmath11cen @xcite and faint fuzzy clusters @xcite that are relatively faint and red but systematically larger than typical gcs .",
    "the existence of these ` peculiar ' gcs has been suspected to be related with dynamical evolutions of their host galaxies .",
    "recently , another new population of star clusters was discovered in nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of three new star clusters in m31 and showed that these star clusters are globular but systematically larger than normal gcs with their half light radii @xmath12 of @xmath13 pc .",
    "similar star clusters were also discovered in m33 @xcite .",
    "the number of these ` extended star clusters ( esc ) ' in m31 has increased to 13 through the wide field survey in the halo of m31 @xcite . a recent report of one esc in the sculptor group dwarf spheroidal galaxy by @xcite shows that escs are not limited to spiral galaxies but they exist in dwarf galaxies .",
    "ngc 6822 is a small barred dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group without any associated neighbors .",
    "stellar populations in ngc 6822 are mostly blue stars younger than @xmath14 myr @xcite .",
    "many previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) reported that star clusters are concentrated within @xmath15 from the center of ngc 6822 .",
    "these include a metal poor and old gc hubble vii ( h vii ) with age @xmath16 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "another gc in ngc 6822 that is of our interest is an intermediate age cluster hubble viii ( h viii ) with diffuse morphology @xcite .",
    "h viii is known to be about @xmath18 gyr old and metal poor with [ fe / h]=@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "one more interesting point with ngc 6822 is that the main galaxy body is enveloped with a huge hi gas cloud @xcite and the hi gas cloud actually constitutes a disk - like rotating structure @xcite .",
    "it is also found that young blue stars are distributed along the hi gas structure @xcite , suggesting that the hi gas has been used for the recent star formation .",
    "however , @xcite show that there is a giant stellar halo composed of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars older than 1 gyr around the main body of ngc 6822 .",
    "the spatial distribution of these rgb stars indicates that the old halo is elongated with its major axis nearly perpendicular to the hi gas structure .",
    "this is consistent with ngc 6822 halo or spheroid composed of intermediate age c stars reported by @xcite .",
    "these recent developments reveal that ngc 6822 is a rather complex system even though it is a small and isolated dwarf galaxy .    in this paper , we present the result of star cluster survey made over the halo of ngc 6822 and the photometric properties of those new star clusters .",
    "preliminary results of this study were given in @xcite , introducing three escs discovered in ngc 6822 .",

    "the locations of the four new star clusters are shown in figure [ obs : map ] and the coordinates are listed in table [ tab1 ] . the first noteworthy point with these new star clusters is their wide spatial distribution .",

    "only one cluster c3 is located in the outskirts of the ellipse defined by @xmath36 , which represents the approximate extent of the optical main body of this galaxy .",
    "previously known star clusters including h vii and h viii @xcite are inside this ellipse .",
    "the projected galactocentric distance of the most distant cluster c1 reaches about 11 kpc in physical scale , which corresponds to about 10 times the major axis radius of ngc 6822 .",
    "figure [ img ] displays thumbnail @xmath31 band images of these new star clusters as well as h vii and h viii in ngc 6822 .",
    "it is easily noted that the new star clusters are more extended than h vii and are partially resolved into their member stars , although the size and richness vary among clusters . on the other hand , h vii ,",
    "is not resolved into individual stars but appears as a single extended source in the same image .",
    "this indicates that the new star clusters have different structural properties than typical globular clusters .",
    "however , c3 , the smallest new cluster , turns out to be similar to h viii that is another globular cluster with diffuse morphology and intermediate - age .",
    "the analysis using the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) based on the resolved stellar photometry is one of the best ways to determine the physical parameters of star clusters .",

    "for c1 , c2 , and c4 the concentric radius of @xmath39 was used , while @xmath40 is adopted for c3 . among the selected stars , however , there are also many foreground stars , which inevitably leads to heavy contamination to the target star clusters .",
    "we corrected the field star contamination by using field stars collected from the annulus set between @xmath41 ( 200 pixels ) and @xmath42 ( 400 pixels ) from each cluster center .",
    "figure [ fscor ] shows the cmd of the new star clusters and their selected fields .",
    "firstly , we calculated the expected number of field stars for each cdm bin with @xmath43 mag by normalizing the number of field stars in the corresponding location of the field cmd .",
    "then , the field star correction was made by rejecting stars separated by less than @xmath44 mag from the expected field stars in each cmd bin of the cluster cmd .",
    "the total number of removed field stars is 34 , 25 , 30 , and 33 , leaving about 190 , 79 , 45 and 60 sources for c1 , c2 , c3 , and c4 , respectively .",

    "the field star subtracted cmds of the new star clusters are displayed in the right column of figure [ fscor ] .",
    "one difficulty in the interpretation of photometric results of ngc 6822 clusters is that ngc 6822 field suffers from a relatively heavy and patchy extinction because it is located in low galactic latitude ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the foreground reddening estimated by @xcite ranges from @xmath47 for the field of c1 to @xmath48 for c2 .",
    "this requires the correction for patchy foreground extinction for the analysis of the photometric properties of star clusters that are widely spread in large area .",
    "we utilized the observed colors of foreground stars , mostly galactic disk dwarf stars , to estimate the reddening for every region in our observed field .",
    "the galactic disk stars are observed as a vertical sequence in @xmath49 and @xmath31 cmds . for a specific region ,",
    "we select high @xmath50 and non - saturated stars with @xmath51 and @xmath52 mag that lie within a circular area of radius @xmath53 and investigate their @xmath49 color distribution .",
    "the resultant color distribution is fitted by a gaussian function to determine the peak @xmath49 color of the foreground stars and the approximate width of the distribution . however ,",
    "if the number of high @xmath50 foreground stars is less than 300 , the size of circular area is increased by @xmath54 to collect more foreground stars for reliable determination .",
    "the peak colors of selected foreground stars range from @xmath55 to @xmath56 and the @xmath49 color distributions are usually very narrow with @xmath57 mag .    to convert this peak @xmath49 color of the foreground stars to the reddening value for the corresponding region , we used the reddening map by @xcite as a reference .",
    "firstly , we select about 220 locations evenly spaced over the @xmath58 field .",
    "the separation between selected locations is about @xmath59 , which is roughly twice the spatial resolution of reddening map by @xcite .",
    "then , we compare the peak @xmath49 color of the foreground stars and the @xmath60 estimate by @xcite for those selected locations to determine the conversion factors that are required to derive the reddening value for every location in the observed field .",
    "more details on the reddening map construction around the field of ngc 6822 will be described in our forthcoming paper ( hwang et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "finally determined and adopted reddening value for each cluster field ranges from @xmath61 for c1 to @xmath62 for c2 , as listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these reddening values are smaller than those estimated from @xcite by about 0.1 mag in @xmath63 , which is about 0.06 mag in @xmath60 .",
    "we use these adopted reddening values for the analysis of cmd of the new star clusters in ngc 6822 .",
    "figure [ cmd ] shows the @xmath64 ",
    "@xmath65 cmd of the resolved stars in c1 @xmath23 c4 .",
    "the adopted reddening for each cluster s field is listed in table [ tab1 ] . the red giant branch ( rgb )",
    "is clearly pronounced in each cmd , although the number of detected rgb stars is different from cluster to cluster .",
    "c1 , the richest cluster among the four new clusters , exhibits a relatively well populated rgb that runs from @xmath66 mag to @xmath67 mag .",
    "the remaining three clusters also display similar rgb features . however , there are still some notable differences",
    ". the faint end of c2 rgb appears to be at @xmath68 , about one magnitude brighter than those of the other clusters .",
    ", on the other hand , the bright end of c3 rgb is at @xmath69 , about one magnitude fainter than the other clusters .",
    "we use the @xmath31band magnitude of the tip of rgb ( trgb ) that is known to be constant for the metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath70 @xcite for the estimation of the distance to each cluster . even though it is hard to get rigorous measurement of the trgb magnitude due to the low number of sources , the cmds in figure [ cmd ]",
    "indicate that the trgbs are located at @xmath71 for c1 , c2 , and c4 .",
    "since the absolute magnitude of trgb in @xmath72-band is @xmath73 mag @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath74 mag , the distance modulus for these three clusters is estimated to be @xmath75 .",
    "this value is similar to the adopted distance modulus for ngc 6822 , @xmath76 @xcite . in the case of c3 , though the fainter trgb magnitude may suggest larger distance than the other clusters , we assume that c3 is a member of ngc 6822 based on the morphological similarity to h viii as shown in figure [ img ] . therefore , we assume that the distance modulus for every cluster is the same as ngc 6822 .    we have compared the observed cluster cmds with the theoretical model isochrones by @xcite based on the adopted distance and the foreground reddening for each cluster in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "we selected two ages , log@xmath77 ( 10 gyr ) and 9.3 ( about 2 gyr ) , and four metallicity , z=0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.001 , and 0.004 ( @xmath78 [ fe / h ] @xmath79 ) .",
    "the comparison with theoretical isochrones shows that rgbs of new star clusters are broad so that isochrones with different metallicities and/or ages can be overlaid at the same time .",
    "that is , the model isochrones with log@xmath77 and @xmath80 z @xmath81 , and log@xmath82 and @xmath80 z @xmath83 can be used to represent the majority of rgb stars in c1 and c2 . for c3 and c4 ,",
    "many bright rgb stars ( @xmath84 ) are traced by the isochrones with @xmath85 z @xmath83 .",
    "this result suggests that the new clusters are as old as log@xmath86 ( about 2 gyr ) and their metallicities range from z=0.0001 ( [ fe / h]@xmath87 ) to z=0.004 ( [ fe / h]@xmath88 ) .",
    "the photometric error in @xmath49 is estimated to be no larger than 0.03 mag when @xmath89 mag , as marked in each panel in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "therefore , for @xmath89 mag , the scatter in rgb may be real , suggesting a metallicity dispersion .",
    "however , considering the crowded nature of clusters and the limited spatial resolution of the current image data , these broad rgbs could be the result of random errors involved in the source detection .",
    "similarly , the study by @xcite show cmds with broad rgbs for three escs in m31 based on the ground - based imaging , overlaid with fiducial lines of different metallicities ranging from [ fe / h]@xmath90 to [ fe / h]@xmath91 .",
    "however , in the subsequent study by @xcite based on the high resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) image data , those m31 escs are confirmed to have well - defined rgbs with no discernible metallicity dispersion .",
    "therefore , the future high resolution observations are crucial for a better determination on the metallicity and age of these new star clusters in ngc 6822 .",
    "we have used apphot package in iraf to derive the integrated luminosity profiles in @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands , and then to determine the structural parameters of the new star clusters . for each star cluster , we adopted incremental circular apertures with radii ranging from 4 to 100 pixels .",
    "the sky of each cluster was determined as the median of pixel values in the 30-pixel - wide annulus set 150 pixel away from the cluster center .",
    "we masked bright foreground stars to prevent any contamination to the magnitude profile .",
    "the measured flux in each aperture was used to construct the magnitude profile of the cluster as shown in figure [ prof ] .    in the case of an isolated star cluster ,",
    "the integrated luminosity profile should flatten out at the outer boundary of the cluster .",
    "however , due to the field stars in the adjacent field , the integrated luminosity profile may not converge to a fixed value but get brighter again at certain radius , which is clearly seen in the profiles of c3 , and c4 .",
    "therefore , we determined the size of a cluster @xmath92 by finding the radius in the integrated magnitude profile where the magnitude difference between adjacent annuli systematically decreases to minimum and , at the same time , the magnitude difference between @xmath92 and the next outer annulus starts to increase again .",
    "we repeated this procedure in @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands for each star cluster and determined the radii @xmath92 in both bands . at @xmath92 , the magnitude difference between",
    "the adjacent annuli is usually about 0.01 mag or less .",
    "the cluster s integrated magnitude was measured at the radius @xmath92 .",
    "the half light radius @xmath93 of a cluster was derived by interpolating along the integrated magnitude profile to find a radius where the luminosity corresponds to half or 0.75 mag fainter than the cluster s integrated magnitude .",
    "figure [ prof ] shows the integrated magnitude profiles of the new star clusters and the determined values of @xmath92 ( long arrows ) and @xmath93 ( short arrows ) .",
    "the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in both @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands are usually in agreement with each other , differing by less than the width of an annulus ( 2 pixels or @xmath94 ) . however , there are a couple of cases that exhibit some differences in @xmath92 and/or @xmath93 depending on the filter bands . in the case of c2 , the @xmath92",
    "is estimated slightly larger in @xmath30 band by about @xmath95 than in @xmath31 band , whereas the @xmath93 values in both bands turn out to be consistent within the tolerance of @xmath94 . for c3 ,",
    "even with the same @xmath92 estimates in @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands , different @xmath93 values are derived , @xmath96 in @xmath30 and @xmath97 in @xmath31 , which is the largest discrepant measurement depending on the photometric bands .",
    "it is regarded due to the difference in the observed profiles depending on the filter band .",
    "therefore , we simply adopt the average of the estimates in both bands as final values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the cluster .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath93 are @xmath98 ( @xmath3 pc ) for c1 , @xmath99 ( @xmath100 pc ) for c2 , @xmath101 ( @xmath102 pc ) for c3 , and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 pc ) for c4 .",
    "we also applied the same method to h vii and h viii using our image data , and derived @xmath105 ( 2.5 pc ) for h vii and @xmath106 ( 6.1 pc ) for h viii .",
    "this indicates that the new star clusters in ngc 6822 are larger than h vii , an analog of typical old gc by a factor of @xmath107 and they are even larger than h viii , the diffuse gc in ngc 6822 .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath93 and the associated errors are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we determined the total magnitude in @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands , and the @xmath49 color of each star cluster based on the aperture photometry made with @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath49 colors of new star clusters are relatively red , ranging from 0.93 ( for c1 ) to 1.67 ( for c3 ) .",
    "colors of the four new star clusters were also measured using smaller apertures with @xmath108 and the result is @xmath109 for c1 , @xmath110 for c2 , @xmath111 for c3 , and @xmath112 for c4 .",
    "these values are consistent with the colors determined using @xmath92 and there appears to be no systematic nor significant radial color gradient in the new star clusters .",
    "some differences in @xmath49 colors are due to the selective inclusion or exclusion of resolved bright rgb stars in the small aperture . ]",

    "this shows that the magnitudes and colors of these gcs in ngc 6822 are similar to those of the galactic gcs .",
    "the fact that the @xmath119 colors of the new star clusters are similar to or redder than those of h vii and h viii in ngc 6822 , suggests that the new clusters are as old as these two gcs .",
    "we have compared the @xmath139 color expected by the theoretical model @xcite with the integrated @xmath119 colors of the new star clusters in ngc 6822 . for z=0.0001 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath87 ) , similar to the metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath140 of h vii @xcite , the model predicts @xmath141 for log@xmath142 so that every new star cluster should be older than log@xmath77 .",
    "this expects c3 and c4 to be even older than log@xmath143 , the maximum age ( about 12.5 gyr ) provided by the model , which requires higher metallicity for these two clusters .",
    "when we assume z=0.004 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath88 ) , the metallicity of hii regions in ngc 6822 @xcite , the ages of c1 and c2 are consistent with @xmath144log@xmath145 , while the estimated age of c3 and c4 is still log@xmath146 .",
    "this is basically in agreement with the results obtained in section [ cmdtxt ] that the new clusters are older than log@xmath82 and relatively metal poor with @xmath80 z @xmath83 .",
    "however , the extremely red integrated colors of c3 and c4 may imply higher metallicity compared to the other clusters or the higher reddening for the corresponding field .",
    "the cmd of c3 in figure [ cmd ] shows that the bright end of rgb is at about @xmath147 , one magnitude fainter than those of the other clusters .",
    "if we assume that the faint rgb is due to the intrinsic or the unaccounted reddening and the unreddened tip of rgb ( trgb ) should be around @xmath148 , then the extra reddening of @xmath149 has to be introduced , making the total reddening of the c3 field @xmath150 .",
    "this would make the reddening corrected color of c3 @xmath151 , similar to the color of h vii and h viii .",
    "however , if the reddening for c3 field is greater than @xmath152 , the theoretical isochrones can not be fitted to the cmd of c3 in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "if we accept that the red colors are intrinsic properties of the star clusters , then it would be worthwhile to note that the two new clusters c3 and c4 are as red as @xmath153 and relatively extended with @xmath154 pc , which satisfies the criteria for faint fuzzy clusters .",
    "this is the first sample of faint fuzzy clusters discovered in the local group .",
    "we will discuss this in section [ ecsetc ] .",
    "the wide spatial distribution of newly discovered star clusters is quite surprising considering that the host galaxy ngc 6822 is a small dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "the new star clusters are spread in the area as large as about @xmath155 , while the existing star clusters are concentrated in the optically visible main body of ngc 6822 that is about @xmath36 wide at most .",

    "this is consistent with the major axis of old stellar halo , which is elongated in the same direction ( ne - to - sw ) as marked in dotted lines in figure [ obs : map ] .",
    "the other point is that the four new star clusters are expected to be older than log@xmath157 based on the cmd and integrated color analysis .",
    "the rgb stars that are used to trace the old halo of ngc 6822 are also relatively old population with log@xmath158 .",
    "these suggest that the old stellar halo and the new old star clusters may share the common formation history .",
    "figure [ rdist ] displays the distribution of half - light radii @xmath93 and @xmath119 colors of the four new clusters as well as h vii and h viii along the projected distance from the ngc 6822 center .",
    "interestingly , as the clusters are located farther from the galaxy center , the clusters tend to be larger in size and bluer in color .",
    "the change of the cluster sizes along the distance can be fitted by a log - square function as shown in dashed lines in fig.[rdist](a ) .",
    "if we consider only the four new clusters , there also seems to be a systematic color change with its gradient about @xmath159 mag / arcmin , marked in dashed lines in fig.[rdist](b ) .",
    "if the red color of c3 , however , is mainly due to the unaccounted intrinsic reddening as discussed in section [ intphot ] , the color gradient along the projected distance would be not so significant .",
    "a similar kind of size distribution is also pointed out for milky way and lmc gcs in the study of @xcite . in the outer galactic halo with galactocentric distance d@xmath160 kpc , only extended gcs with @xmath161 pc are found , while the inner halo is populated with both compact and extended gcs .",
    "similarly , lmc gcs with @xmath162 pc are only found in the region farther than @xmath163 from the galaxy center .",
    "this dependence of star cluster size on the galactocentric distance may be interpreted as the result of high survival rate of extended clusters from the disruption in the outer halo where relatively weak tidal forces are exerted upon the clusters by the galaxy itself .",
    "the similar trend observed in the size distribution of star clusters in figure [ rdist ] shows that the old cluster system of ngc 6822 has a common characteristic with galactic gc as well as lmc gc systems .",
    "another noteworthy point is that the extended gcs with @xmath162 pc are usually metal poor with [ fe / h]@xmath164 , as shown in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of the four new clusters is estimated to be @xmath80 z @xmath81",
    "( @xmath165 [ fe / h ] @xmath166 ) if we assume the age of clusters log@xmath77 .",
    "if we interpret the color distribution in figure [ rdist](b ) as metallicity distribution , it leads to strong correlation between the metallicity and the cluster size , that is , the lower metallicity for the larger clusters .",
    "this would be consistent with the metallicity distribution of extended galactic gcs .",
    "this may also suggest the metallicity gradient in the halo of ngc 6822 , lower metallicity in the outer halo than in the inner halo .",
    "the spatial distribution of old stars combined with old extended clusters makes stark contrast to the central part of ngc 6822 dominated by young stellar populations .",
    "this shows that a small dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822 is actually a complex of two distinct stellar structures , old stellar halo and young central body .",
    "recent studies also show that the young stellar populations are not restricted to the central body of ngc 6822 but are distributed around the large hi gas structure @xcite extending northwest - to - southeast direction @xcite .",
    "this hi gas structure with blue stars with ages of @xmath167 yr is almost perpendicular to the alignment of the new star clusters and the elongated old stellar halo ( see figure [ obs : map ] ) .",
    "ngc 6822 is not the only one dwarf irregular galaxy known to have such a complex stellar structure .",
    "the co - existence of underlying old stellar population and the gas - rich young stellar structure is also reported in other dwarf irregular galaxies , including leo a @xcite , lmc @xcite , and ic 10 @xcite .",
    "the origin of such complex stellar structures in dwarf irregular galaxies is not clearly understood yet .",
    "however , it has been recently suggested that the merging between gas - rich dwarf galaxies may induce the formation of the outer old and the inner young stellar structures @xcite .    even though it is relatively common to have old underlying stellar structure in dwarf irregular galaxies , escs associated with the old stellar halo",
    "are not discovered in other dwarf galaxies but only in ngc 6822 .",
    "if the old stellar structure is the remnant of the merged galaxy as suggested by some theoretical studies , the old escs should have survived the merging or accretion process , which is an important clue to the understanding of their origin .",
    "escs in small dwarf galaxies are rarely known .",
    "ngc 6822 and scl - de1 , a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the sculptor group @xcite , are the only cases where escs are reported to date . however ,",
    "if we define the escs only by their large size , then such extended clusters may not be totally new . even in the milky way galaxy , there are already about 10 gcs with r@xmath168 pc and the largest gc , palomar 14 , is even as large as r@xmath169 pc @xcite , which could be easily classified as escs .",
    "nevertheless , even those extended gcs are found to satisfy a certain criterion set between the luminosity and the size of clusters , that is , log@xmath170 outlining the upper limit locus in @xmath171 versus @xmath172 parameter space @xcite .",
    "figure [ radist ] shows that gcs in lmc , as well as the galactic gcs , also satisfy the same criterion .    on the other hand ,",
    "the exceptionally bright and large gcs , ngc 2419 and @xmath11cen are found not to satisfy the above criterion . instead , these two gcs appear to occupy the similar parameter space with very small dwarf galaxies such as ultra compact dwarf ( ucd ) galaxies @xcite , as shown in figure [ radist ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath11cen is known to have multiple stellar populations and is regarded as the core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "these results have led to consider that the criterion set by @xcite could be used to separate typical gcs from other types of compact objects such as core of dwarf galaxies .    however , recently numerous observational studies have led to discoveries of star clusters that do not satisfy the criterion set by @xcite .",
    "some examples include gcs in a giant elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 .",
    "@xcite show that new gcs in ngc 5128 fill in the gap that used to exist around the gc locus set by @xcite in the parameter space of @xmath171 versus @xmath172 over a large range of luminosity ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "especially , combined with newly discovered luminous gcs in ngc 1399 @xcite , figure [ radist ] shows that the new ngc 5128 gcs appear to smoothly connect typical gcs with the existing luminous gcs including ngc 2419 and @xmath11cen , crossing the gc locus .",
    "the major characteristics of these newly discovered clusters are the high luminosity and the extended structure , larger than typical gcs .",
    "since these properties are also common to ucds and ` dwarf - globular transition objects ( dgto ) ' in the virgo cluster @xcite , some of the luminous gcs may be regarded as remnant or stripped core of dwarf galaxies , such as in the case of @xmath11cen .",
    "we have added the four escs and two gcs ( h vii and h viii ) in ngc 6822 as well as 13 escs in m31 @xcite and one esc in m33 @xcite to the @xmath171 versus @xmath172 plot in figure [ radist ] .",
    "it is clear that four m31 escs , m33 esc , and c1 in ngc 6822 lie above the locus that defines the upper limit for typical gcs , while the other new clusters c2 , c3 , and c4 in ngc 6822 as well as the other escs in m31 occupy the same parameter space with typical gcs . with the addition of gcs in ngc 5128 , the distribution of star clusters with @xmath174 over the gc locus set by @xcite appear rather smooth , implying that escs could be an extension or a family of typical gc population .",
    "it is also noted that every sample of escs discovered to date usually has almost the same magnitude range covering @xmath175 .",
    "however , escs in m31 , m33 , and ngc 6822 are quite different from the luminous gcs in ngc 5128 and ngc 1399 since the escs are more than 2 magnitude fainter in @xmath120 band . between these two classes of clusters , there appears to be a zone defined by @xmath176 and @xmath177 , marked by a dotted box in figure [ radist ] , where few star clusters and/or dwarf galaxies are found .",
    "even ngc 5128 gcs that span the large magnitude range from @xmath178 to @xmath179 , do not occupy this ` avoidance zone ' .",
    "this leads to a speculation that faint escs may be physically different from the luminous extended gcs .",
    "we will discuss more about this in section [ ori ] .",
    "however , further observational investigations are required over other gc systems to confirm whether the ` avoidance zone ' is physically real .",
    "another class of star clusters that is worth consideration is the faint fuzzy clusters .",
    "faint fuzzy clusters have large size ( r@xmath180 pc ) and faint luminosity ( @xmath181 ) as marked by two rectangle lines in figure [ radist ] .",
    "one more characteristic of faint fuzzy clusters is the red color ( @xmath182 ) , slightly redder than typical gcs .",
    "these clusters were first introduced by @xcite and are known to exist only in some nearby sb0 galaxies including ngc 1023 , ngc 3384 , and ngc 5195 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that faint fuzzy clusters are relatively old ( @xmath183 gyr ) , as massive as @xmath184 @xcite , and moderately metal rich with [ fe / h]@xmath185 @xcite . from figure [ radist ] , it is noted that faint fuzzy clusters satisfy the criterion set by @xcite as shown by the sample of faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 5195 @xcite , suggesting that the faint fuzzy clusters could be another population of old gcs .",
    "we have shown that , among the four new star clusters in ngc 6822 , two clusters c3 and c4 can be classified as faint fuzzy clusters with @xmath186 .",
    "the other two clusters c1 and c2 have @xmath119 colors of typical gcs , which excludes them from the class of faint fuzzy clusters .",
    "the comparison with theoretical isochrones as well as model integrated colors implies that the metallicity of c3 and c4 may be z@xmath187 , i.e. , [ fe / h]@xmath188 .",
    "this is consistent with the general picture of faint fuzzy clusters with moderately higher metallicity than that of typical gcs @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the two new extended star clusters , c3 and c4 , may be the first sample of faint fuzzy clusters in the local group .",
    "the faint fuzzy clusters have been discovered only in three sb0 type galaxies including ngc 1023 , ngc 3384 , and ngc 5195 and these clusters are regarded as disk population , following disk rotation confirmed in ngc 1023 @xcite .",
    "therefore , discovery of faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 6822 is very interesting in the following two points : ( 1 ) ngc 6822 is not an sb0 type but dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "this makes the first case of faint fuzzy clusters discovered in a galaxy that is not sb0 type .",
    "( 2 ) the two extended clusters c3 and c4 are located in the halo , not in the disk - like structure , of ngc 6822 .",
    "a noteworthy point regarding the origin of faint fuzzy clusters is that the existing faint fuzzy clusters are found in galaxies that have undergone dynamical interactions with neighboring galaxies .",
    "therefore , the formation of these peculiar clusters is suspected to have correlation with the dynamical interactions of host galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . as mentioned in section [ complex ] ,",
    "ngc 6822 is a complex of old and young stellar populations superimposed upon a giant hi disk - like structure and such a complex structure is suspected to be the product of merger - like events that may have triggered the very recent increase of star formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the existence of faint fuzzy clusters and escs may be consistent with the complex structure of ngc 6822 .      as many escs are discovered in the very outer part of galaxies ,",
    "their origin and formation mechanism are of great importance for the understanding of the galaxy halo as well as escs themselves .",
    "currently , there are several views on the origin or the formation of escs , which can be roughly categorized into the following three scenarios :    1 .",
    "the remnant or core of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies form escs .",
    "collisions of two or more star clusters in star cluster complexes or super - star cluster make escs .",
    "star clusters are born in various sizes and some escs survive the disruption under the weak tidal field .    without spectroscopic and deeper imaging observations at the current stage , it is difficult to know the origin of escs in ngc 6822",
    ". however , we briefly discuss the above three scenarios one by one in the context of dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822 .",
    "since the size of many escs are of similar to those of very small dwarf galaxies such as ucds , the escs have been suspected to be remaining cores of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "a representative example is @xmath11cen in the milky way @xcite . if these escs are remaining cores or remnants of dwarf galaxies , then one of some important characteristics would be their stellar contents of multiple populations .",
    "the study by @xcite shows that the four escs in m31 , observed with hst , do not reveal any signature of multiple stellar populations but only display features of typical old gcs in the cmd analysis .",
    "the spectroscopic observation of resolved stars in one m31 esc by @xcite also suggests that the cluster is not a dark - matter dominated system .",
    "these results of observational studies are against the dwarf galaxy core scenario for the origin of escs .    however , one important difference between clusters like @xmath11cen and m31 escs is the luminosity .",
    "as shown in figure [ radist ] , many luminous gcs with @xmath189 share the same parameter space with @xmath11cen and ucds . on the other hand ,",
    "m31 escs are @xmath190 , fainter than @xmath11cen - like clusters by more than 2 magnitude .",
    "these two classes of escs are separated in @xmath93 and @xmath191 space by the so - called ` avoidance zone ' defined in section [ ecsetc ] and marked in figure [ radist ] .",
    "therefore , these two classes may be physically different populations .    like m31 escs , ngc 6822 escs are also fainter than @xmath192 , located on the fainter side of the ` avoidance zone ' in figure [ radist ] .",
    "therefore , it is likely that ngc 6822 escs should be similar to m31 escs in many respects , rather than the remnant or the core of defunct dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , deep imaging and high resolution spectroscopic observations are required to test this possibility .",
    "the mechanism of star cluster collisions in cluster complexes or super star clusters to form escs has been suggested by @xcite to explain the origin of faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 1023 .",
    "this scenario requires the interaction of galaxies to induce strong star formation and to form super star clusters or stellar complexes within which collisions of individual clusters would lead to form eventually escs or faint fuzzy clusters .",
    "actually , some super star clusters or star cluster complexes have been reported in galaxies that are undergoing dynamical interactions , such as the antennae galaxy @xcite and m51 @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical structure of young stellar population has been recently reported in the central part of ngc 6822 @xcite , although the estimated mass of these stellar groupings or associations is relatively small ( @xmath193 ) compared to super star clusters in other galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath194 in the antennae ) .",
    "it may still provide some chance of star cluster collisions within the hierarchical structure at the central part of ngc 6822 due to the high spatial density . since ngc 6822 escs have similar old age and are spread over the wide area where no specific structure is observed other than rather smoothly distributed old stars , formation of these escs from several regions of high stellar density would require strong star formation events over a huge volume enveloping the whole stellar halo of ngc 6822 .",
    "this may not be consistent with the star formation history of ngc 6822 that strong star formation has only been initiated very recently , about @xmath167 yr ago @xcite .",
    "star formations are also expected to begin from the very early stage of stellar evolution of ngc 6822 , possibly @xmath195 gyr ago @xcite , but it is not clear whether the old star formation was strong enough to form large stellar complexes .    in a very recent study by @xcite , it has been proposed that the merger of two star clusters within low mass dark matter haloes could produce an esc .",
    "it involves very small mass of dark matter halo so that the velocity dispersion at the cluster center would be @xmath196 km sec@xmath197 , which is beyond the measurement accuracy of the current facilities .",
    "the velocity dispersion of one esc , ec4 , in m31 is estimated to be @xmath198 km sec@xmath199 @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to this theory , the esc could still have a small mass dark - matter that help to sustain the extended structure .",
    "another recent theoretical study by @xcite argues that star clusters can be born very extended and the clusters could evolve to become old escs if the clusters are placed under the weak tidal field , which would be possible only in the outskirts of dwarf galaxies such as ngc 6822 .",
    "this also suggests that , under the strong tidal field , it would be impossible for star clusters to survive to become old escs .",
    "this implies that escs , even those observed in a large spiral galaxy like m31 , are supposed to form in small dwarf galaxies .",
    "based on a wide - field survey of m31 halo , @xcite show that many halo gcs of m31 are likely to be found close to stellar streams and that about one - third of the newly discovered halo gcs are of the extended nature .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that m31 escs have assembled into m31 halo as a consequence of accretion from the proto - dwarf galaxies that should have disrupted leaving stellar streams behind .",
    "this is also consistent with the observational result that the spectroscopically measured velocities of one esc ec4 in m31 and a nearby stellar stream are in agreement with each other @xcite , indicating the the esc and the stellar stream are physically associated .    the systematic variation in the sizes of escs along the galactocentric distance of ngc 6822 , as shown in figure [ rdist ] , may be consistent with this scenario in terms that the smaller clusters ( e.g. , c3 ) are located closer to the galaxy center where the tidal interaction would be strong , while the larger cluster ( e.g. , c1 and c4 ) in the outer halo where the tidal force would be weak .",
    "combined with the systematic change of color along the galactocentric distance , it may support the idea that the escs have formed as part of the old stellar halo of ngc 6822 .",
    "this is also consistent with the suggestion that escs may be an extension or another family of typical gcs .",
    "however , this poses an intriguing question about why ngc 6822 was more effective to form escs over the other dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "there are not many dwarf galaxies that possess old gc system .",
    "only about four dwarf irregulars including lmc and about five dwarf spheroidals among more than 30 dwarf galaxies in the local group are known to have their own gc system @xcite .",
    "there is even no known dwarf galaxies in the local group that have any esc other than ngc 6822 . unlike ngc 6822 that is relatively isolated without neighbors ,",
    "many other dwarf galaxies are found in groups concentrated around two giant spiral galaxies , the milky way and m31 , in the local group .",
    "the environmental condition of ngc 6822 might have contributed to create the optimal tidal field to have escs . however , further wide and deep observations around other dwarf galaxies are required to find any answer to this question .",
    "if we define escs as gcs with large physical size , @xmath200  @xmath201 pc , then the origin of escs observed in many galaxies seems to be diverse depending on the environment and the evolutionary history followed by the host galaxies .",
    "at least , there may be two populations of escs that have different formation mechanisms .",
    "the first class includes escs that are relatively luminous with @xmath202 mag and are located in the brighter side of the ` avoidance zone ' in the @xmath191 and @xmath93 parameter space in figure [ radist ] .",
    "examples include a few galactic gcs such as @xmath11cen and ngc 2419 , some luminous gcs in ngc 5128 and ngc 1399",
    ". since these escs are comparable to ucds and dgtos in terms of the luminosity and size , it would be reasonable to assume that these luminous escs and compact galaxies should have common origins .",
    "the fact that some of these escs are known to have signs of multiple stellar populations ( e.g. , @xmath11cen ) can be supportive of the argument that escs are the cores of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies",
    ". it would be also very interesting to test whether some of these luminous escs could be remnants of super star clusters or large stellar complexes .    the second class of escs is composed of relatively faint clusters including extended clusters in m31 and m33 as well as faint fuzzy clusters .",
    "these escs are less luminous and are located in the fainter side of the ` avoidance zone ' in figure [ radist ] .",
    "the escs discovered in ngc 6822 belong to this class .",
    "these escs may share the same formation mechanism with typical gcs but have evolved under the specifically optimized tidal field .",
    "faint fuzzy clusters may be a sub - population of this class with slightly enriched metallicity .",
    "dwarf galaxies would be the preferred place for the formation of such escs due to the relative weak tidal forces exerted by less massive galaxies , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , dwarf galaxies with escs seem to be rare .",
    "only two dwarf galaxies are known to date to have escs : ngc 6822 in the local group and scl - de1 in sculptor group @xcite .",
    "future observations over the large number of dwarf galaxies would be valuable resources to test this idea on the origin of escs .",
    "these two classes of escs , regardless of their luminosities , seem to be intermediary objects between typical compact gcs and large dwarf galaxies .",
    "a similar idea has been proposed by @xcite on the study of ucds arguing that ucds may be composed of more than two physically distinct populations including stripped nuclei of galaxies , giant gcs or super star clusters , and disrupting gcs based on a tight correlation between mass and size of those objects . adopting this scheme ,",
    "the first class escs belong to giant gcs or stripped nuclei of galaxies , while the second class escs belong to the disrupting gcs . between these two different classes",
    ", there exists a region where neither the first class nor the second class are found ( see their figure 16 ) , which corresponds to the ` avoidance zone ' in figure [ radist ] .",
    "one more point that might be worth noting is that there is still a possibility that some escs found in the outermost halo of galaxies might not be bound to the gravitational potential of the host galaxies .",
    "a recent report on the intergalactic gcs in the virgo cluster by @xcite reveals that there are numerous gcs wandering in the space between galaxies . in ngc 6822",
    ", c1 is located well beyond the extent of stellar halo .",
    "considering that ngc 6822 has no distinct close neighbors , c1 could be the first candidate of intergalactic gcs in the local group .",
    "future observations to get the velocity of c1 as well as the other escs in ngc 6822 would be invaluable to have better idea on their origins .",
    "we have discovered four new star clusters in the halo of dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822 from a wide field imaging survey .",
    "the star clusters have extended structures with @xmath203 pc , larger than typical gcs by a factor of @xmath204 .",
    "the clusters are distributed over a large space with their projected galactocentric distance ranging from @xmath205 ( about 1.5 kpc ) to @xmath6 ( about 11 kpc ) , far beyond the optical body of ngc 6822 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the new star clusters is coincident with the spatial structure of old stellar halo revealed by recent studies .",
    "the analyses of the integrated color as well as cmds of cluster member stars suggest that the new star clusters are likely to be as old as @xmath206 gyr , and the metallicity is estimated to be between z=0.0001 and z=0.004 depending on the adopted age . among the four new clusters , at least two clusters ,",
    "c3 and c4 , can be classified as faint fuzzy clusters based on their very red color with @xmath207 and large size with @xmath154 pc .",
    "the red color of these two clusters could be interpreted as the result of moderately enriched metallicity with z@xmath208 , which is consistent with the metallicity of existing sample of faint fuzzy clusters in the literature .    the colors and the sizes of the new clusters are found to be correlated with the projected distance from the center of ngc 6822 and the clusters located closer to the center are smaller in size and redder in color than the clusters in the outer halo .",
    "we suggest that the color gradient may be due to the metallicity gradient existing in the stellar halo and the differences in the cluster size may be correlated with the strength of tidal field of ngc 6822 : the stronger the tidal field , the smaller the size of clusters .",
    "this is consistent with the recent theoretical study on the formation of escs , arguing that escs form and survive the disruption only under the weak tidal field condition that would be possible in small dwarf galaxies like ngc 6822 .",
    "however , deeper imaging and high resolution spectroscopic observations are required to determine the age and the metallicity with higher confidence , as well as the kinematical properties of these four new escs",
    ". the future observational data would be invaluable resources to understand more clearly the origin of these escs as well as the evolutionary history of complex dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822 .",
