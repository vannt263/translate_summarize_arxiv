    "due to the rapid improvement of quality of products of today , it is difficult to assess the failure information of a product using traditional life testing procedures , which record only failure times .",
    "an alternative approach is to collect the degradation data at higher levels of stress , thus yielding more information about the lifetime distribution in a reasonable amount of time compared to traditional life tests .",
    "such a life testing plan is called an accelerated degradation test ( adt ) .",
    "mathematical models for analyzing adt data have been proposed by meeker & escobar @xcite .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite described accelerated degradation models that relate to physical failure mechanisms .",
    "yu & tseng @xcite proposed a stopping rule for terminating an adt .",
    "chen & zheng @xcite proposed an approach for degradation analysis which makes inference directly on the lifetime distribution .",
    "huang & dietrich @xcite , used maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the model s parameters .",
    "joseph & yu @xcite , developed a methodology for quality improvement when degradation data are available as the response in the experiments .",
    "adt is usually very costly , since it requires destroying a considerable number of products at each level of stress .",
    "moreover , determining suitable levels of stress for the experiment is not straightforward . to handle these problems ,",
    "step stress accelerated degradation tests ( ssadt ) were proposed by tseng & wen @xcite in a case study of leds . in a ssadt framework ,",
    "each product is first tested , subject to a pre - determined stress level for a specified duration , and the degradation data are collected . a product which survives until the end of the first step",
    "is again tested at a higher stress level and for a different time duration .",
    "the stress level is elevated step by step until an appropriate termination time is reached .",
    "the advantage of the ssadt is that the number of test units needed for conducting this test is relatively small .    to conduct a ssadt efficiently",
    ", special attention is paid to the number of tested units ( sample size ) , measurement frequency and termination time . for adt , boulanger &",
    "escobar @xcite addressed the problem of optimal determination of the stress levels as well as the sample size for each stress level for a specified termination time .",
    "the problem of optimizing the test design have been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "three commonly used optimization criteria are the minimum approximated variance of the maximum likelihood estimators ( mle ) of reliability , mean time to failure ( mttf ) and the quantiles of the lifetime distribution .",
    "@xcite discussed the optimal planning of a simple ssadt and minimized the test cost while achieving a requisite level of estimates , from which the optimal number of inspections of the whole test can be determined .",
    "liao & tseng @xcite used a wiener process to model a typical ssadt problem and then , under the additional constraint that the total experimental cost does not exceed a predetermined budget , obtained the optimal settings of the ssadt for minimizing the of the estimated 100@xmath0 percentile of the product s lifetime distribution .",
    "they derived the optimal test plans for the sample size , measurement frequency and termination time .",
    "@xcite discussed the ssadt problem for a gamma process and gave the optimal settings for minimizing the of the estimated mttf of the lifetime distribution of the product .",
    "recently , pan & balakrishnan @xcite proposed a step - stress accelerated degradation test ( ssadt ) plan in which the stress level is elevated when the degradation value of a product crosses a pre - specified value .",
    "in such a plan the times of elevating the stress levels are random and vary from product to product .",
    "however , such a plan can be extended to a more economic plan in two ways .",
    "first one can extend the model such that the times of stress level elevating in the new model be identical for all products , which enable us to use only one chamber ( oven ) for testing all test units .",
    "second , one can conduct the plan such that it does not require continuous inspection of the degradation by the experimenter ( or may be electronic sensors ) . in",
    "the later we do nt need to spend any money on electronic sensors and also we have decreased the cost of measurement .    to extend the model",
    ", we assume that the measurements are made at the end of consecutive intervals of fixed duration . the experimenter elevates the stress level as soon as a new measurement of at least one of the test units exceeds the threshold value .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a ssadt model when the degradation path follows a gamma process .",
    "the measurements are made at times @xmath1 , for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the measurement frequency in unit of time and @xmath4 is the number of measurements .",
    "the stress level is elevated as soon as a new measurement of the degradation of one at least of the test units exceeds the threshold value .",
    "next , under the constraint that the total experimental cost does not exceed a pre - specified budget , the optimal settings including the optimal threshold value , sample size , measurement frequency and termination time are obtained by minimizing the avar of an estimated quantile of the lifetime distribution of the product .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is described in section ii .",
    "an optimization algorithm is presented in section iii to obtain the optimal settings under budget constraints .",
    "section iv presents a real data example for illustrating the proposed algorithm and some concluding remarks are made in section v.",
    "suppose that @xmath5 test units are subject to a degradation test .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the degradation path of the product under a level of stress @xmath7 at time @xmath8 .",
    "denote the use stress level ( under the normal conditions ) by @xmath9 .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath10 unit under the normal conditions , @xmath11 , is defined the first time that @xmath12 crosses the critical value @xmath13 , that is @xmath14 in which @xmath15 , denotes the degradation value of the @xmath10 unit under the stress @xmath9 at time @xmath8 .",
    "pan & balakrishnan @xcite , proposed a ssadt model in which the @xmath16 stress level of the @xmath10 unit , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , is elevated as soon as the degradation of the unit passes the threshold value @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence , the testing stress of the @xmath10 unit , @xmath17 , under such a ssadt model can be expressed for the stress values @xmath21 as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the termination time of the test and @xmath24 in which @xmath25 , denotes the degradation value of the @xmath10 unit under the stress levels @xmath26 at time @xmath8 .",
    "we should keep in mind that the degradation values do not depend on the random variables @xmath27 and the random variables @xmath27 depend on the degradation values .",
    "in other words , we have @xmath28 also ,",
    "it is worth noting the difference of notations in this paper with the paper of pan and balakrishnan @xcite . in this paper",
    ", @xmath29 denotes the cumulative degradation value of @xmath30 item during the test , under the @xmath31 stress level , while in pan and balakrishnan @xcite , it denotes the cumulative degradation value of @xmath30 item during the @xmath31 stress level .",
    "they considered both wiener and gamma processes for the degradation path of the products . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the independent increments of the degradation path of the products follows a gamma process ( lawless & crowder @xcite ) ; that is , for fixed @xmath8 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for the gamma distribution with shape and scale parameter @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "however , implementing the above ssadt model with stress model ( [ si ] ) is not economic , since the main results for conducting a ssadt is that , we can economically use only one chamber ( oven ) , which allows us to elevate gradually the stress levels at specified ( or random ) times for all testing units . from equation ( [ si ] ) , it is clear that @xmath5 chambers should be used simultaneously , since with current metrology technology it is not possible to conduct such an ssadt plan within a single chamber .    a more economic model with random stress - elevating times",
    "can be conducted with the common stress @xmath44 for all test units , in which @xmath45    under the ssadt plan with stress model ( [ s1 ] ) , the @xmath16 stress level is elevated for all units as soon as the degradation of at least one of the units exceeds the threshold value @xmath46 .",

    ", we have @xmath58    the second step for conducting a more economic plan is to extend the model with test stress model ( [ s1 ] ) such that it does not require continuous inspection of the degradation level of test units by the experimenter or electronic sensors . in the following ,",
    "we describe the extended model with discrete inspection times .    suppose we want to make @xmath4 measurements for each unit with a measurement frequency per @xmath3 unit of time .",
    "note that for the stress model ( [ s1 ] ) , since the stress elevating time is random , we can only determine the total number of measurements and the number of measurements under each stress level is random . under the @xmath16 stress level , @xmath18",
    ", we elevate the stress level , as soon as a new measurement of the degradation of at least one of the test units exceeds the threshold value @xmath19 .",

    "<S> recently , a step - stress accelerated degradation test ( ssadt ) plan , in which the stress level is elevated when the degradation value of a product crosses a pre - specified value , was proposed . </S>",

    "<S> the proposed extended model has two economical advantages compared with the previous one . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that the times of stress level elevating in the new model are identical for all products , which enable us to use only one chamber ( oven ) for testing all test units . </S>",
    "<S> the second is that , the new method does not require continuous inspection and to elevate the stress level , it is not necessary for the experimenter to inspect the value of the degradation continually . </S>",
    "<S> the new method decrease the cost of measurement and also there is no need to use electronic sensors to detect the first passage time of the degradation to the threshold value in the new method . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the degradation path follows a gamma process . </S>",
    "<S> the stress level is elevated as soon as the measurement of the degradation of one of the test units , at one of the specified times , exceeds the threshold value . under the constraint </S>",
    "<S> that the total experimental cost does not exceed a pre - specified budget , the optimal settings including the optimal threshold value , sample size , measurement frequency and termination time are obtained by minimizing the asymptotic variance of an estimated quantile of the lifetime distribution of the product . </S>",
