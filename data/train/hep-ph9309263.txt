    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) and confinement are two crucial features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "indeed , it might be argued that a realistic model of qcd should manifest both of these properties since they are responsible for the nature of the hadronic spectrum ; dcsb ensuring the absence of low mass scalar partners of the pion and confinement ensuring the absence of free quarks , for example .",
    "a natural method for studying both dcsb and confinement in qcd , and models thereof , is the complex of dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) .",
    "@xcite the equations for the two - point functions of gluons and quarks have been used in many such studies .",
    "this manifestly relativistically covariant approach , recent reviews of which can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , has provided the foundation for a useful and successful understanding of the phenomena of low energy qcd by facilitating the construction of realistic field theoretic models .",
    "@xcite    another goal in the dse studies is to develop this nonperturbative approach to a point where it is as firmly founded as lattice qcd and calculationally competitive .",
    "although much remains to be done in order to achieve this goal there has been a good deal of progress , especially in the study of abelian gauge theories where direct and meaningful comparisons can be made , and agreement obtained , between the results of lattice and dse studies.@xcite    in considering dse studies it is important to note that they are hampered by the fact that there is an infinite tower of coupled equations : the equations for the two - point functions couple them to other two- and three - point functions ; the equations for the three - point functions couple them to the four - point and higher n - point functions ; etc .",
    "a commonly used resolution of this problem is to truncate the system at a finite number of coupled equations by making _",
    "anstze _ for the higher n - point functions .",
    "for example , one may study the dse for the quark propagator alone by choosing _",
    "anstze _ for the gluon propagator and quark - gluon vertex thus closing the system .",
    "this is the nature of our study .",

    "( [ sprop ] ) satisfies both of these requirements .",
    "such a form for the gluon propagator , even though it may be argued to describe a confined gluon , is perhaps counterintuitive , since it would appear to provide a weak interaction between quarks at small @xmath7 , which corresponds to large distances .",
    "indeed , some studies of the fermion dse in qcd have employed quite a different _ ansatz _ : one which behaves as @xmath8 for .",
