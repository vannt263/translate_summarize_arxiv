    "it has been shown @xcite that the dynamics of self - focused light channels  in the form of spatial bright solitons  can be effectively described by the motion of an equivalent particle in effective step - like potentials .",
    "this `` equivalent particle theory '' actually corresponds to the adiabatic approximation of the perturbation theory of solitons @xcite , while reflection - induced radiation effects can be described at a higher - order approximation @xcite . note that similar studies ,",

    "ii , we provide the description and modeling of the problem ; although this is done in the context of atomic becs , our model can straightforwardly be used for similar considerations in the context of optics , as mentioned above . in the same section",
    ", we apply perturbation theory for dark solitons to show that , in the adiabatic approximation , soliton dynamics is described by the motion of an equivalent particle in an effective potential .",
    "the latter has a tanh - profile , but  in the presence of the nonlinearity step  can also exhibit an elliptic and a hyperbolic fixed point . we show that stationary soliton states do exist at the fixed points of the effective potential , but are unstable ( albeit in different ways , as is explained below ) according to a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis @xcite that we perform ; we also use an analytical approximation to derive the unstable eigenvalues as functions of the magnitudes of the potential / nonlinearity steps . in sec .",
    "iii we study the soliton dynamics for various parameter values , pertaining to different forms of the effective potential , including the case of rectangular barriers formed by combination of adjacent potential and nonlinearity steps .",
    "our numerical results  in both statics and dynamics  are found to be in very good agreement with the analytical predictions .",
    "we also investigate the possibility of soliton trapping in the vicinity of the hyperbolic fixed point of the effective potential ; note that such states could be characterized as `` surface dark solitons '' , as they are formed at linear / nonlinear interfaces separating different optical or atomic media .",
    "we show that quasi - trapping of solitons is possible , in the case where nonlinearity steps are present ; the pertinent ( finite ) trapping time is found to be of the order of several hundreds of milliseconds , which suggests that such soliton quasi - trapping could be observable in real bec experiments . finally , in sec .  iv we summarize our findings ,",
    "discuss our conclusions , and provide provide perspectives for future studies .",
    "as noted in the introduction , our formulation originates from the context of atomic becs in the mean - field picture @xcite .",
    "we thus consider a quasi-1d setting whereby matter waves , described by the macroscopic wave function @xmath3 , are oriented along the @xmath4-direction and are confined in a strongly anisotropic ( quasi-1d ) trap .",
    "the latter , has the form of a rectangular box of lengths @xmath5 , with the transverse length @xmath6 being on the order of the healing length @xmath7 .",
    "such a box - like trapping potential , @xmath8 , can be approximated by a super - gaussian function , of the form : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the trap amplitude and width , respectively .",
    "the particular value of the exponent @xmath12 is not especially important ; here we use @xmath13 . in this",
    "setting , our aim is to consider dark solitons near potential and nonlinearity steps , located at @xmath14 .",
    "to model such a situation , we start from the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite : @xmath15 \\psi , \\label{gpe1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 is the mean - field wave function , @xmath17 is the atomic mass , @xmath18 represents the external potential , while @xmath19 is the effectively 1d interaction strength , with @xmath20 being its 3d counterpart and @xmath21 being the scattering length ( assumed to be @xmath22 , @xmath23 , corresponding to repulsive interatomic interactions ) . the external potential and the scattering length",
    "are then taken to be of the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constant values of the potential and scattering length , to the left and right of @xmath14 , where respective steps take place .",
    "notice that such potential steps may be realized in present bec experiments upon employing a detuned laser beam shined over a razor edge to make a sharp barrier , with the diffraction - limited fall - off of the laser intensity being smaller than the healing length of the condensate ; in such a situation , the potential can be effectively described by a step function . on the other hand",
    ", the implementation of nonlinearity steps can be based on the interaction tunability of specific atomic species by applying external magnetic or optical fields @xcite .",
    "for instance , confining ultracold atoms in an elongated trapping potential near the surface of an atom chip @xcite allows for appropriate local engineering of the scattering length to form steps ( of varying widths ) , where the atom - surface separation sets a scale for achievable minimum step widths .",
    "the trapping potential can be formed optically , possibly also by a suitable combination of optical and magnetic fields ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a relevant discussion ) .",
    "measuring the longitudinal coordinate @xmath4 in units of @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the healing length ) , time @xmath29 in units of @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the speed of sound and @xmath32 is the peak density ) , and energy in units of @xmath33 , we cast eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) to the following dimensionless form ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 . unless stated otherwise , in the simulations below we fix the parameter values as follows : @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( for the box potential ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the potential step , as well as @xmath40 and @xmath41 $ ] for the nonlinearity step",
    "nevertheless , our theoretical approach is general ( and will be kept as such in the exposition that follows in this section ) .",
    "here we should mention that eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) can also be applied in the context of nonlinear optics @xcite : in this case , @xmath42 represents the complex electric field envelope , @xmath29 is the propagation distance and @xmath4 is the transverse direction , while @xmath18 and @xmath21 describe the ( transverse ) spatial profile of the linear and nonlinear parts of the refractive index  @xcite .",

    "such a situation corresponds , e.g. , to the case where @xmath57 , @xmath38 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a formal small parameter ( this choice will be used in our simulations below ) . in the present work",
    ", we assume that the jump from left to right is `` sharp '' , i.e. , we do not explore the additional possibility of a finite width interface .",
    "if such a finite width was present but was the same between the linear and nonlinear interface , essentially the formulation below would still be applicable , with the heaviside function above substituted by a suitable smoothened variant ( e.g. a @xmath61 functional form ) .",
    "a more complicated setting deferred for future studies would involve the existence of two separate widths in the linear and nonlinear step and the length scale competition that that could involve .",
    "equation  ( [ upsilon ] ) can be studied analytically upon employing perturbation theory for dark solitons ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) : first we note that , in the absence of the perturbation @xmath62 , eq .",

    "then , considering an adiabatic evolution of the dark soliton , we assume that in the presence of the perturbation the dark soliton parameters become slowly - varying unknown functions of time @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the soliton phase angle becomes @xmath72 and , as a result , the soliton coordinate becomes @xmath73 , with @xmath74 .",

    "( [ ds ] ) , it can readily be found that @xmath77 . on the other hand , using eq .",
    "( [ upsilon ] ) and its complex conjugate , yields the evolution of the renormalized soliton energy : @xmath78 , where bar denotes complex conjugate .",
    "then , the above expressions for @xmath79 yield the evolution of @xmath65 , namely @xmath80 inserting the perturbation ( [ p ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dphi1 ] ) , and performing the integration , we obtain the following result : @xmath81 where we have considered the case of nearly stationary ( black ) solitons with @xmath82 ( and @xmath83 ) . combining eq .",
    "( [ dphi2 ] ) with the above mentioned equation for the soliton velocity , @xmath74 , we can readily derive the following equation for motion for the soliton center : @xmath84 where the effective potential @xmath85 is given by : @xmath86      the form of the effective potential suggests that fixed points , where  potentially  dark solitons may be trapped , exist only in the presence of the nonlinearity step ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "i.e. , it is the competition between the linear and nonlinear step that enable the presence of fixed points and associated more complex dynamics ; in the presence of solely a linear step , the dark soliton encounters solely a step potential , similarly to what is the case for its bright sibling  @xcite ; see also below .",

    ", we may investigate possible quasi - trapping of the soliton , using an initial condition at the stable branch , incoming towards the hyperbolic fixed point at the origin .",
    "indeed , choosing @xmath164 and @xmath249 ( notice that here , the corresponding effective barrier @xmath250  cf . top panel of fig .  [ delta2 ] ) , we find the following : the soliton arrives at the origin , stays there for a time @xmath251 , and then it is transmitted through the region @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , the corresponding trajectory found at the pde level is depicted by stars in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ delta2 ] , while the relevant contour plot showing the evolution of the soliton density is shown in the bottom panel of the same figure .",
    "notice , again , the fairly good agreement between numerical and analytical results .",
    "we note that for the same parameter values , but for @xmath98 , elliptic fixed points do not exist , and the effective potential has simply the form of a sech@xmath252 barrier , as mentioned above ( see also work of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case , starting from the same initial position , @xmath164 , and for @xmath166 ( corresponding to @xmath253 ) , we find that the trapping time is @xmath254 , i.e. , almost half of the one that was when the nonlinearity steps are present ( results not shown here ) .",
    "this observation , along with the results presented in the previous sections , indicate that nonlinearity steps / barriers are necessary either to facilitate or enhance soliton trapping in such inhomogeneous settings .",
    "we have studied matter - wave dark solitons near linear potential and nonlinearity steps , superimposed on a box - like potential that was assumed to confine the atomic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the formulation of the problem finds a direct application in the context of nonlinear optics : the pertinent model can be used to describe the evolution of beams , carrying dark solitons , near interfaces separating optical media with different linear refractive indices and different defocusing kerr nonlinearities .    assuming that the potential / nonlinearity steps were small , we employed perturbation theory for dark solitons to show that , in the adiabatic approximation , solitons behave as equivalent particles moving in the presence of an effective potential .",
    "the latter was found to exhibit various forms , ranging from simple tanh - shaped steps  for a spatially homogeneous scattering length ( or same kerr nonlinearity , in the context of optics )  to more complex forms , featuring hyperbolic and elliptic fixed points  in the presence of steps in the scattering length ( different kerr nonlinearities ) .    in the latter case , we found that stationary soliton states do exist at the fixed points of the effective potential . using a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis",
    ", we showed that these states are unstable : dark solitons at the hyperbolic fixed points have a pair of unstable real eigenvalues , while those at the elliptic fixed points have a complex eigenfrequency quartet , dictating a purely exponential or an oscillatory instability , respectively .",
    "we also used an analytical approximation to determine the real and imaginary parts of the relevant eigenfrequencies as functions of the nonlinearity step strength .",
    "the analytical predictions were found to be in good agreement with corresponding numerical findings obtained in the framework of the bdg analysis .",
    "we then studied systematically soliton dynamics , for a variety of parameter values corresponding to all possible forms of the effective potential . adopting the aforementioned equivalent particle picture",
    ", we found analytically necessary conditions for soliton reflection at , or transmission through the potential and nonlinearity steps : these correspond to initial soliton velocities smaller or greater to the energy of the effective steps / barriers predicted by the perturbation theory and the equivalent particle picture .",
    "we also investigated the possibility of soliton ( quasi- ) trapping , for initial conditions corresponding to the incoming , stable manifolds of the hyperbolic fixed points ( which exist only for inhomogeneous nonlinearities ) . in the context of optics",
    ", such a trapping can be regarded as the formation of surface dark solitons at the interface between dielectrics of different refractive indices .",
    "we found that trapping is possible , but only for a finite time .",
    "this effect can be understood by the fact that stationary solitons at the hyperbolic fixed points are unstable , as was corroborated by the bdg analysis .",
    "thus small perturbations ( at the pde level ) eventually cause the departure of the solitary wave from the relevant fixed points .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that the time of soliton quasi - trapping was found to be of the order of @xmath255 in physical units ; thus , typically , for a healing length @xmath7 of the order of a micron and a speed of sound @xmath256 of the order of a millimeter - per - second , trapping time may be of the order of @xmath257  ms .",
    "this indicates that such a soliton quasi - trapping effect may be observed in real experiments .",
    "note that in all scenarios ( reflection , transmission , quasi - trapping ) our analytical predictions were found to be in very good agreement with direct numerical simulations in the framework of the original gross - pitaevskii model .",
    "we have also extended our considerations to study cases involving two potential and nonlinearity steps , that are combined so as to form corresponding rectangular barriers .",
    "reflection , transmission and quasi - trapping of solitons in such cases were studied too , again with a very good agreement between analytical and numerical results . in this",
    "setting , special attention was paid to the limiting case of infinitesimally small distance between the adjacent potential / nonlinearity steps that form the barriers . in this case",
    ", we found that , due to a pitchfork bifurcation , the stability of the fixed point of the effective potential at the barrier center changes : out of two hyperbolic and one elliptic fixed point , a hyperbolic fixed point emerges , and the potential rectangular barrier is reduced to a delta - like impurity .",
    "the latter is described by a sech@xmath252 effective potential , in accordance with the analysis of earlier works @xcite .",
    "our methodology and results pose a number of interesting questions for future studies .",
    "first , it would be interesting to investigate how our perturbative results change as the potential / nonlinearity steps or barriers become larger , and/or attain more realistic shapes ( including steps bearing finite widths , as well as gaussian barriers  cf . ,",
    "e.g. , recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the same context , a systematic numerical  and , possibly , also analytical ",
    "study of the radiation of solitons during reflection or transmission ( along the lines , e.g. , of ref .",
    "@xcite ) should also provide a more complete picture in this problem .",
    "furthermore , a systematic study of settings involving multiple such steps / barriers , and an investigation of the possibility of soliton trapping therein , would be particularly relevant .",
    "in such settings , investigation of the dynamics of moving steps / barriers could find direct applications to fundamental studies relevant , e.g. , to superfluidity ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , transport of becs @xcite , and even hawking radiation in analog black hole lasers implemented with becs @xcite . finally , extension of our analysis to higher - dimensional settings , would also be particularly challenging : first , in order to investigate transverse excitation effects that are not captured within the quasi-1d setting , and second to study similar problems with vortices and other vortex structures .",
