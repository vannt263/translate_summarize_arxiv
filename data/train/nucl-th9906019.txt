    "recently , much attention has been paid to experimental investigations of coherent @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction off nuclei , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a real or virtual photon and @xmath6 is a nucleus in its ground state .",
    "this reaction is of special interest for nuclei with zero spin and isospin . in this case",
    "the theoretical treatment simplifies and contains only a minimum number of ingredients . since the description of the nuclear ground state is well under control , the reaction is then suitable for analyzing medium effects in the production and propagation of @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the earliest theoretical and experimental studies of this reaction had the aim to extract additional information about the elementary amplitude , in particular about the values of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 multipoles , which are related to the excitation of the resonances @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the general interest in this field was revived in the 80 s in the context of studying the photoproduction of neutral pions on the proton in order to check the threshold predictions of low energy theorems .",
    "on the other hand , coherent @xmath0 photoproduction off nuclei was considered as unique tool to examine the properties of the pion - nucleus interaction and to obtain information about the behavior of the pion in the nuclear medium . the theoretical method used for this purpose was the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) .",
    "while this method was originally formulated in coordinate space with a purely phenomenological optical potential , the modern approach to dwia uses a representation in momentum space .",
    "the first application of the dwia in the momentum space to pion photoproduction on nuclei was due to eramzhyan and collaborators @xcite . within this approach the pion - nucleus interaction ( or final state interaction ",
    "fsi ) is treated dynamically starting from the elementary pion - nucleon amplitude , and consistently taken into account of nonlocalities of the photoproduction operator and off - shell effects .",
    "in particular , this method was applied to the case of coherent @xmath0 production by ref .",
    "@xcite . in the same spirit ,",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite developed their dynamical model for pion photoproduction on the nucleon .",
    "however , fsi is only one aspect of the medium effects due to the modification of the pion propagator in the nuclear medium .",
    "another important issue is the modification of the resonance characteristics ( width and position ) inside a nucleus .",
    "this problem was the subject of numerous investigations , especially in the framework of the @xmath3-hole model . for a review and further literature ,",
    "the reader is referred to the monographs  @xcite .",
    "this issue will be the main subject of our study .",
    "for this purpose we apply , for the first time , the unitary isobar model ( uim ) of ref .",
    "@xcite to pion photoproduction on nuclei .",
    "this recently developed model is particularly adopted to describe the elementary process on the nucleon in the nuclear environment .",
    "an important advantage of this model is that the contributions of the background ( born terms and vector meson exchange ) and `` dressed '' @xmath3 resonance are separated in a unitary way . as we will show below this allows us to incorporate medium effects in a self - consistent way with regard to both the `` bare '' @xmath11 vertices and @xmath3 excitations due to pion rescattering .",
    "another advantage of the uim is that it covers both pion photoproduction and pion electroproduction up to 4-momentum transfers of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , this model provides quite a unique opportunity to investigate the @xmath13 dependence of medium effects .",
    "note that the first theoretical study of the medium effects in the coherent @xmath0 electroproduction on the heavy nuclei was done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we consider the main theoretical ingredients to describe pion photo- and electroproduction on nuclei .",
    "our results and predictions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we shall demonstrate that all the available data for coherent pion photoproduction on @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be described , in a self - consistent way , with the same parameter set for the @xmath3 self - energy .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in the case of an unpolarized beam and unpolarized target , the 5-fold differential cross section in the @xmath16 frame can be written as ( see ref.@xcite for details ) @xmath17 which defines the virtual photon cross section    @xmath18    with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the degree of transverse polarization and the flux of the virtual photon , respectively . denoting the photon s @xmath16 energy by @xmath21 and its three - momentum by @xmath22 , we have    @xmath23^{-1}\\,,\\qquad \\gamma = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi^2}\\ \\frac{e_{e'}}{e_{e}}\\,\\frac{k}{q^2}\\ \\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon}\\,.\\ ] ]    in accordance with our previous work , we define the flux by the photon `` equivalent energy '' @xmath24 , with the mandelstam variable @xmath25 , @xmath26 the mass of the nuclear target , and the square of the four - momentum transfer @xmath27 .    the first two terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) are the transverse ( t ) and longitudinal ( l ) cross sections , and the third and fourth terms are the transverse - longitudinal ( tl ) and transverse - transverse ( tt ) interference cross sections .",
    "the latter ones can be separated by use of their typical dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath28 of pion emission . as in the case of pion electroproduction on the free nucleon , these four cross sections may be expressed in terms of the nuclear tensor @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 corresponding to the cartesian coordinates @xmath32 or @xmath33 , which leads to the following relations in the @xmath34 frame :    @xmath35    @xmath36    with @xmath37",
    "the `` photon equivalent energy '' in the @xmath34 frame and @xmath38 the pion momentum .",
    "note that we use a right - handed coordinate system with the positive @xmath33-axis along the virtual photon momentum @xmath39 and the @xmath40-axis along the vector @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the nuclear tensor @xmath29 is defined in terms of the nuclear transition amplitudes @xmath42 describing the transitions from the initial states @xmath43 to the final states @xmath44 with spin @xmath45 and projection @xmath46 . after summing and averaging over the nuclear spin degrees of freedom we obtain @xmath47    for the purpose of the numerical calculations it is convenient to express the nuclear amplitudes in the covariant spherical basis @xmath48 by the relations @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the helicity of the transverse photon .    in the case of targets with zero spin ,",
    "the general symmetry properties and the pseudoscalar nature of the pion have the consequence that the transverse nuclear amplitude @xmath51 contains only a term proportional to @xmath52 $ ] in the pion - nucleus @xmath34 frame .",
    "hence @xmath53 \\cdot { \\bf e}_{\\lambda}\\ , , \\qquad f_{fi}^{(0)}=0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are unit vectors in the directions of the pion and the virtual photon momentum , respectively .    in the right - handed coordinate system with the @xmath33-axis along @xmath55 and the @xmath40-axis along @xmath56 $ ] ,",
    "only the @xmath57 tensor component remains .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 and all other cross sections in eq .",
    "( 3 ) vanish . in this case",
    "the expression for the virtual photon cross section simplifies to  @xcite @xmath59    it should be noted that eqs .",
    "( 8 - 9 ) are general . as a consequence",
    "the differential cross section has a @xmath60 and @xmath61 dependence in all cases , independently of the reaction mechanism .",
    "in fact , this peculiarity of coherent pion photo- and electroproduction on spin zero nuclei is often used to separate coherent and incoherent contributions , or to measure the degree of photon polarization , because the photon asymmetry @xmath62 equals unity .",
    "let us first consider the nuclear amplitude in a simple plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) .",
    "the corresponding amplitude is denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the elementary pion electroproduction amplitudes @xmath64 and reduced to the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 the set of nucleon coordinates , a phase space factor @xmath67 given by @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 the initial and final nucleon momenta , @xmath71 the nuclear ( nucleon ) energies , @xmath72 the momentum transfer to the nucleus , and @xmath73 expressed by the @xmath34 momentum and energy of the virtual photon .    the invariant amplitude @xmath64 describes the elementary process on the free nucleon .",
    "it is evaluated within the framework of the uim in terms of the standard cgln amplitudes @xmath74 , with the pion angle @xmath75 and the total energy @xmath76 in the @xmath77 @xmath34 system , @xmath78 note that in the literature there are several prescriptions for the relations between total pion - nuclear energy @xmath79 and @xmath76 with various physical or mathematical motivations ( see for example refs.@xcite ) . using this freedom we in principle can effectively take into account medium effects and improve by this way ( or `` optimize '' ) impulse approximation .",
    "however , our main aim is the study the medium effects explicitly .",
    "therefore , in the present work we will use physically transparent relation ( 12 ) which does not contain information about residual nucleus and about final state .",
    "the next problem is related to the treatment of fermi motion , i.e. the dependence of the amplitudes on the nucleon s momentum @xmath69 .",
    "previous studies of pion - nucleus scattering @xcite and pion photoproduction reactions @xcite showed that a good approximation to the proper averaging over fermi motion is given by the `` factorization approximation '' , which supposes that the main part of fermi motion can be accounted for by evaluating the elementary amplitude at `` effective '' nucleon momenta @xmath69 and @xmath80 in the initial and final states , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of nucleons . the same approximation , but in the nuclear rest frame is taken in refs .",
    "@xcite . note that this approximation is based on the fact that for gaussian nuclear wave functions ( which reproduce the ground state of light nuclei sufficiently well ) the replacement leads to an exact treatment of the terms linear in @xmath83 in the elementary amplitude .",
    "moreover , it allows a consistent description of nuclear and nucleon kinematics , by means of a simultaneous conservation of energies and momenta for both the pion - nucleus and the pion - nucleon systems . as an example",
    "this factorization approximation was tested numerically for pion photoproduction on p - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently this approximation was also examined within a more elaborate relativistic model for coherent pion photoproduction on @xmath15 @xcite .    in the case of coherent photo- and electroproduction of neutral pions on spin and isospin zero nuclei ,",
    "the factorization approximation allows us to obtain the following simple expression for the pwia amplitude @xmath63 @xmath84 \\cdot { \\bf e}_{\\lambda}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath85/2 $ ] is the isoscalar non spin - flip part of the elementary amplitude boosted to the pion - nucleus @xmath34 frame .",
    "the nuclear form factor is normalized to @xmath86 .",
    "it can be extracted from the nuclear charge form factor by the relation @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the proton charge form factor .",
    "the nuclear form factor @xmath89 used in our present work is taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "let us now consider the full dwia amplitude including pion distortion or fsi effects . in momentum space",
    "it takes the form  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the contribution from the pion - nucleus interaction expressed in terms of the pion - nucleus elastic scattering amplitude @xmath92 , @xmath93 in this equation , the relativistic reduced mass of the pion - nucleus system is given by @xmath94 .",
    "note that the main difference compared to standard dwia is the factor @xmath95 , which eliminates double counting of pion rescattering on one and the same nucleon .",
    "such effects are in fact already included in the elementary amplitude .",
    "finally , the pion scattering amplitude @xmath92 is constructed as solution of a lippmann - schwinger integral equation ( for details see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the detailed information about the elementary reaction amplitude for the free nucleon is given in ref.@xcite . in the coherent @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction on spin zero nuclei only the spin independent",
    "part contributes .",
    "therefore , in the pion - nucleon @xmath34 frame we have @xmath96 \\cdot { \\bf e}_{\\lambda}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the standard cgln amplitude and @xmath98 is the photon ( pion ) momentum in the @xmath99 @xmath34 frame .",
    "these momenta can be boosted to an arbitrary frame by the lorentz transformation @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the total energies for the photon - nucleon ( pion - nucleon ) systems in the arbitrary and @xmath34 frames , respectively .",
    "the total momentum @xmath103 is given in the arbitrary frame . using the factorization approximation ( 13 ) and the transformation ( 18 ) , we can get a simple connection between the @xmath104 amplitude of eq .",
    "( 14 ) with the cgln amplitude @xmath97 , @xmath105\\,f_2\\,.\\ ] ]    within the uim the amplitude @xmath97 contains contributions from born and vector meson exchange terms , @xmath106 , and from `` dressed '' @xmath107 resonances , @xmath108 . in our present work we consider the photon s @xmath16 energy range @xmath109 mev , for which the s - channel @xmath9 resonance gives the most important contribution .",
    "the multipole @xmath110 related to the resonance is parametrized in a unitary way by a standard breit - wigner form , i.e. @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 accounts for the small contribution of the roper resonance @xmath10 . in eq .",
    "( 20 ) , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the @xmath11 and @xmath116 vertex function , respectively , @xmath117 and @xmath118 the energy and total width of the @xmath3 resonance as defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the unitary phase @xmath119 adjusts the phase of the total multipole ( background+resonance ) to the corresponding pion - nucleon scattering phase , in accordance with the fermi - watson theorem .",
    "as has been mentioned in the introduction , it is one of the advantages of the dwia approach in momentum space that it allows us to account for the nonlocality of the elementary operator and off - shell effects .",
    "such effects originate mainly from the principal value part of the eq .",
    "( 16 ) , the nonlocality being related with the dependence of the amplitude on the pion momentum @xmath120 . for the background contribution @xmath106 ,",
    "this dependence is in principle fixed by the form of the lagrangians .",
    "however , the uim background contribution is derived from lagrangians with a zero - range interaction . in this case",
    "the standard way ( often used in coupled channels  @xcite , dynamical  @xcite or meson exchange  @xcite models ) is to introduce the finite range aspects of the interaction by an off - shell form factor . in this spirit",
    "we have multiplied the background contribution by a dipole - like form factor @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the on - shell value of the pion momentum in the @xmath99 @xmath34 frame corresponding to the total energy @xmath76 for the @xmath77 system .",
    "the standard value for the cut - off parameter @xmath123 , which provides the best fit in many calculations of pion - nucleon scattering and pion photoproduction , is in the range of 400 - 500 mev . in our present work",
    "we shall fix this parameter at @xmath124 mev . for consistency with our off - shell extrapolation of the pion - nucleon scattering amplitude in the @xmath125 channel  @xcite",
    ", we shall use the prescription @xmath126 for the @xmath3 contribution , with the factor @xmath127 providing the correct threshold behavior in the off - shell case .",
    "it has been known from numerous @xmath3-hole model calculations of pion scattering , pion photoproduction and photoabsorption reactions that the properties of the bound @xmath3 isobar in the nuclear medium differ substantially from those of the free @xmath3 ( see ref .  @xcite and references therein ) .    in the case of pion photo- and electroproduction , two main mechanisms excite the @xmath3 isobar excitation , i ) a direct excitation with a `` bare '' @xmath11 vertex , which corresponds to diagram ( b ) in fig . 1 ,",
    "and ii ) a vertex renormalization mechanism , for which the @xmath3 is excited with pions produced by background terms ( diagram ( c ) in fig .  1 ) .",
    "as has been shown recently  @xcite contributions of these two diagrams are equally important and , therefore , medium effects have to account for both mechanisms .",
    "the natural way to do so is to introduce medium effects in the form of dressed resonance contributions ( diagram ( a ) ) as defined by the uim and given by eq .",
    "however , as a first step , the relativistic @xmath3 propagator with the unitary phase @xmath128 has to be reduced to the nonrelativistic breit - wigner form .",
    "this can be achieved by the transformation @xmath129 where    @xmath130    @xmath131    the next step is to modify dwia amplitude by introducing the so - called @xmath3 self - energy @xmath132 on the @xmath133 of eq . ( 23 ) , i.e. @xmath134    in the literature we find many approaches to calculate @xmath132 within simple models based on the local density approximation  @xcite or more refined microscopical calculations  @xcite based on the @xmath3-hole model .",
    "such models were quite successful in describing pion scattering and pion photoproduction on heavy nuclei . however , one of the peculiarities of these approaches is that they finally always incorporate elements of phenomenology . in our present work",
    "we will do so from the very beginning by looking for a phenomenological parametrization of @xmath132 which should be simple , common for all nuclei and able to describe the available data . for this purpose",
    "we shall test two types of parametrization    @xmath135    and @xmath136    where @xmath137 is a ( complex and energy - dependent ) free parameter .",
    "the first parametrization , eq .",
    "( 26a ) , is convenient to use in momentum space .",
    "here we assume that @xmath138 is the @xmath139-shell harmonic oscillator form factor with @xmath140 @xmath141 and that @xmath132 is already saturated for @xmath14 .",
    "this has the consequence that @xmath142 and @xmath138 have the same values for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the second parametrization , eq .",
    "( 26b ) , results from the local density approximation , the nuclear density @xmath143 being normalized to @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 self - energy will differ for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "finally we note that in the present context we neglect medium effects due to the roper resonance , because this contribution is very small in our energy range , i.e. of the order of 2 - 3% at a photon s @xmath16 energy @xmath145 mev .",
    "one of the attractive features of coherent pion photo- and electroproduction on nuclei is that we can obtain clear signals from modifications of the @xmath3 isobar in the nuclear medium . for this purpose ,",
    "2 presents our results for the reaction @xmath146 and @xmath147 at a photon s _ lab _ energy @xmath148 mev . in this energy region",
    "the standard dwia calculations substantially overestimate the measured differential cross sections .",
    "our dwia results ( dashed curves ) in the maximum are larger than the experimental data by approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "as was shown in previous studies , one of the reasons for this large discrepancy is the interaction of the @xmath3 isobar with the surrounding nucleons .",
    "the @xmath3-nucleus interaction leads to a renormalization of the @xmath3 propagator and can be described in terms of the @xmath3 self - energy @xmath132 .",
    "the recently measured differential cross sections for the reaction @xmath146 and forthcoming new data for @xmath147 to be measured over a wide energy region ( @xmath149 mev ) provide us with a unique opportunity to determine @xmath132 with good accuracy . as has been pointed out in the last section , we shall now test two types of parametrizations given by eq . ( 26 ) .",
    "first , let us consider @xmath150 parametrization ( 26b ) conventionally used in the analysis of elastic pion - nucleus scattering .",
    "note that a taylor expansion of eq .",
    "( 25 ) in @xmath151 leads to medium corrections in @xmath152 , which were often used in analyses of pion - nucleus scattering .",
    "one of the consequences of this parametrization is that for finite nuclei it gives a good description of the differential cross sections in forward direction but fail at large angles and in the resonance region . on",
    "the other hand pion scattering on light nuclei at backward angles is usually better described without the phenomenological @xmath153 term ( or without @xmath3 medium effects ) .",
    "> from fig .",
    "2 we can see that the coherent @xmath0 photoproduction situation is similar to the case described above ( see the dash - dotted curves ) .",
    "this result clearly indicates that for light nuclei the treatment of the @xmath3-nucleus interaction in terms of @xmath151 becomes less satisfactory .",
    "therefore , nuclei like @xmath14 require a more sophisticated microscopical calculation of the @xmath3 self - energy , e.g. the @xmath3-hole  @xcite or meson exchange models  @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that the first microscopical @xmath3-hole calculation performed some 15 years ago by j. koch and e. moniz  @xcite gives excellent agreement with the results of the recent measurements ( see the dotted curve in fig .",
    "however , a consistent extension of the microscopical calculations to heavier nuclei meets serious difficulties , and at some level it always requires elements of phenomenology .",
    "therefore , we decide to use another approach in our present work .",
    "first , with the use of the @xmath154 parametrization ( 26a ) in momentum space , we extracted @xmath132 from the data for the reaction @xmath146 .",
    "then , we assume that the @xmath3-nucleus interaction is the same also for the heavier nuclei , i.e. , that it saturates already for @xmath14 .",
    "our calculations at @xmath148 mev indicate that this is indeed a realistic assumption , and allows us to describe the coherent @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath14 and @xmath15 over a wide range of pion angles ( see the solid curves in fig .",
    "the obtained values for the strength of the @xmath3-nucleus interaction , @xmath155=19 mev and @xmath156= -33 mev , are in reasonable agreement with the values obtained in pion - nucleus scattering .",
    "this result inspires us to test our model at other energies assuming that @xmath142 is an energy dependent function to be determined by fitting the experimental data for @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "3 we present results of our fit in the energy range @xmath157 mev . in fig .",
    "4 the prediction of our model is compared with the new experimental data from ref.@xcite . the energy dependence for the total cross section and the parameters @xmath142",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "5 . these results for the potential parameter @xmath142 agree qualitatively well with the predictions of ref.@xcite .",
    "our most interesting result is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where the prediction is compared to the data of the a2 collaboration at mami for the reaction @xmath147 obtained at a pion angle @xmath158 .",
    "even at such a large angle where the differential cross section has dropped by more than an order of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , our assumption about the saturation of the @xmath3-nucleus interaction is still quite acceptable .",
    "of course , a better understanding of this phenomenon will require additional data at smaller angles where the differential cross section reaches a maximum , as well as data for other nuclei .",
    "a new feature of the @xmath3-nucleus interaction can be investigated and new information about the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath132 can be obtained by using virtual photons ( or coherent @xmath0 electroproduction ) . clearly , as the @xmath3 isobar should not remember how it was excited , the @xmath142 does not depend on @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the strength of its interaction with the surrounding nucleons is universal for all processes ( electroproduction , pion scattering , compton scattering , etc . ) and the @xmath13 dependence enters the parametrization of eq .",
    "( 26a ) only in the form factor @xmath159 , with @xmath160 the momentum transferred to the nucleus and @xmath39 the virtual photon momentum as function of @xmath13 , @xmath161    in fig .",
    "7 we depict the predictions of our model for : i ) an equivalent photon energy @xmath162=228 mev and @xmath13=0 , 0.054 , 1.81 @xmath163 , and ii ) @xmath162=289 mev and @xmath13=0 , 0.074 , 1.61 @xmath163 .",
    "this corresponds to the kinematics of the recent and forthcoming data from nikhef  @xcite",
    "in this paper we have presented a first nuclear application of our recently developed unitary isobar model to pion photo- and electroproduction .",
    "this model describes all the existing data for @xmath164 and @xmath165 on the nucleon reasonably well and furthermore compares very well with the partial wave analysis of the vpi group up to @xmath166 .",
    "we have performed a dwia calculation for coherent @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction from nuclei and applied it to experimentally investigated reactions on @xmath14 and @xmath15 . due to the very precise data recently measured at mainz over a large angular range of photon @xmath16 energies from 207 mev up to 397 mev",
    ", we are able to determine , for the first time , the energy dependence of the @xmath3-nucleus potential from pion photoproduction reactions . comparing @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "we find no a - dependence of the potential and conclude that the @xmath3-nucleus interaction saturates already for @xmath14 .",
    "in our study of the dynamical mechanism of the @xmath3 self - energy in the nuclear medium we find that a form factor type @xmath3-nucleus interaction is preferred as compared to a density type of medium modification often used in the local density approximation of coordinate space calculations .      for future experiments it will be very interesting to see how the @xmath3-nucleus interaction saturates by measurements on the deuteron and on @xmath167 and , secondly ,",
    "if the saturation observed for @xmath15 is valid for the heavier nuclei .",
