    "this work is motivated by the problem of understanding the large - scale limit of stochastic interface evolution @xcite .",
    "more precisely we are interested in the motion of the interface between two stable thermodynamic phases in a @xmath5-dimensional medium .",
    "needless to say , the physically most interesting case is that of @xmath6 .",
    "the motion results from thermal fluctuations ; overall the interface tends to flatten , thereby minimizing its free energy .",
    "mathematically we consider an _ effective interface approximation _ where the internal structure of the two phases above and below the interface is disregarded and the @xmath7-dimensional interface is modeled as the graph of a function from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( or some discretised version of this ) . the physical rationale behind this approximation is a time - scale separation : the internal degrees of freedom of the two phases relax much faster than those of the interface .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations is modeled as a markov chain and the fact that phases are in coexistence translates to reversibility of that chain .    on phenomenological grounds",
    "@xcite one expects that , on sufficiently coarse scales , the interface dynamics is deterministic and described by a hydrodynamic equation of the type @xmath10}{\\delta \\psi(x , t)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the equilibrium surface free energy and @xmath12 is a mobility coefficient , that depends on the details of the dynamics .",
    "note that , without the prefactor @xmath13 , would be simply the gradient flow associated with the surface energy functional .",
    "we can therefore interpret @xmath13 as describing how effective the relaxation produced by the dynamics is , hence the name mobility .",
    "the relevant space - time rescaling where the behavior described by should emerge is the diffusive one .    writing @xmath14 as the integral of the slope - dependent surface tension , @xmath15=\\int \\mathrm{d}x_1 \\mathrm{d}x_2\\ , \\sigma(\\nabla\\psi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equation takes the parabolic form @xmath16 where parabolicity derives from convexity of @xmath17 . in general , the pde is non - linear and the mobility is expected to be a non - trivial function of the slope .",
    "it is very difficult , in particular if @xmath18 , to prove convergence to a hydrodynamic equation starting from a non - trivial microscopic model .",
    "even worse , in general it is not possible to guess , even heuristically , an explicit expression for the mobility ; in fact , its expression as provided by the green - kubo formula involves an integral of space - time correlations computed in the stationary states @xcite .",
    "exceptions where @xmath13 can be written down explicitly are usually models where the dynamics satisfies some form of `` gradient condition '' , i.e. the microscopic current is the lattice gradient of some function @xcite .",
    "the only example we know of a rigorous proof of the hydrodynamic limit for a @xmath18 diffusive interface dynamics is the work @xcite by funaki and spohn .",
    "there , the langevin dynamics for the @xmath19 ginzburg - landau model with symmetric and convex potential is studied and the convergence to a hydrodynamic limit of the type is proven .",
    "see also @xcite where the analogous result is proven in a domain with dirichlet instead of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is important to remark that for the ginzburg - landau model the mobility turns out to be a constant , that can be set to @xmath20 by a trivial time - change .    in dimension @xmath21 , instead , natural markov dynamics of discrete interfaces are provided by conservative lattice gases on @xmath22 ( e.g. symmetric exclusion processes or zero - range processes ) , just by interpreting the number of particles at site @xmath23 as the interface gradient @xmath24 at @xmath23 . similarly ,",
    "conservative continuous spin models on @xmath22 translate into markov dynamics for one - dimensional interface models with continuous heights .",
    "then , a hydrodynamic limit for the height function @xmath25 follows from that for the particle density ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 4 and 5 ) for the symmetric simple exclusion and for a class of zero - range processes , and",
    "for instance @xcite for the @xmath21 ginzburg - landau model ) . for @xmath18 ,",
    "instead , there is in general no natural way of associating a height function to a particle system on @xmath26 .    in the present work",
    ", we study a two - dimensional stochastic interface evolution for which we can obtain a hydrodynamic limit of the type .",
    "our model is very different from the ginzburg - landau one .",
    "first of all , the interface is discrete ( heights take integer values ) so that the dynamics is a markov jump process rather than a diffusion .",
    "more importantly , the mobility coefficient @xmath13 in the limit pde is a non - constant ( and actually non - linear ) function of the interface slope .",
    "the state space of our markov chain is the set of lozenge tilings of the two - dimensional triangular lattice , or more precisely of its @xmath1 periodization .",
    "lozenge tilings of the triangular lattice are well known to be in bijection with perfect matchings ( aka dimer coverings ) of the dual lattice , which is the honeycomb lattice @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig:2n ] .",
    "( left ) and lozenge tiling of the triangular lattice ( right ) .",
    "the horizontal dimers will be called `` particles '' . , width=264 ]    on the other hand , since @xmath27 is planar and bipartite , its perfect matchings are in bijection with a height function defined on its faces , see fig .",
    "[ fig : monsurf ] .",
    "this height function will then be our model of discrete two - dimensional interface .",
    "the dynamics we study is reversible with respect to a two - parameter family of ergodic gibbs measures , that are locally uniform measures on lozenge tilings .",
    "these measures are labelled by the two parameters of the interface slope and have a determinantal representation @xcite .",
    "it is important to recall that such measures are far from looking like product bernoulli measures : indeed , correlations decay like the inverse distance squared , while the height function itself tends in the large - scale limit to a two - dimensional massless gaussian field @xcite .",
    "starting with section [ sec : model ] we will adopt the dimer instead of the tiling point of view , and actually we will view the dimer configuration as an interacting particle system ( `` particles '' being the horizontal dimers as in figure [ fig:2n ] ) .",
    "such particles satisfy particular interlacement conditions , recalled in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the updates of the dynamics consist in a horizontal dimer ( or particle ) jumping a certain distance @xmath2 vertically ( up or down ) in the hexagonal lattice , and such transition will be assigned a rate @xmath3 ( the prefactor @xmath28 is there just to conform with the previous literature ) .",
    "see section [ sec : model ] for a precise definition .",
    "the jumps are not always allowed , not only because particles can not superpose , but also because jumps can not violate the above - mentioned interlacement constraints .",
    "this point is very important : in fact , it is the interlacement constraints that are responsible for the long - range correlations in the equilibrium measures .",
    "if instead we had only the exclusion constraint , the equilibrium measure would be bernoulli .",
    "let us call `` long - jump dynamics '' the lozenge tiling dynamics just described , to distinguish it from the `` single - flip glauber dynamics ''",
    "where only jumps of length @xmath29 are allowed .",
    "let us mention that the single - flip dynamics is equivalent to the glauber dynamics of the three - dimensional ising model at zero temperature with dobrushin boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the long - jump dynamics has an interesting story .",
    "it was originally introduced in @xcite with the goal of providing a markov chain that approaches the uniform measure on tilings , in variation distance , in a time that is polynomial in the system size @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the key point is that the mutual volume between two interface configurations is a super - martingale , which allows to apply path coupling arguments .",
    "later , in @xcite it was proven that the total variation mixing time of the long - jump dynamics is actually of order @xmath31 , and that ( in special domains ) a particular one - dimensional projection of the height function evolves according to the one - dimensional heat equation .",
    "the results of @xcite were used as a building block in @xcite to prove that , under some conditions on the geometry of the domain , the mixing time of the single - flip glauber dynamics is of order @xmath32 , like that of the long - jump dynamics .",
    "finally , in @xcite we discovered that , in contrast with the single - flip dynamics , the long - jump one satisfies certain identities , that allow to conjecture an explicit form for the hydrodynamic equation , cf . or equivalently . while the dynamics does not satisfy a gradient condition in the usual sense that the microscopic current is a discrete gradient , still a discrete summation by parts causes the `` dangerous '' part in the mobility coefficient , the one involving space - time correlations , to vanish ( * ? ? ?",
    "a reflection of this fact is the summation by parts that takes place in proposition [ prop : id ] below .    in the present work ,",
    "we prove rigorously the convergence to the hydrodynamic equation , in the case of periodic boundary conditions . see theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "the strong correlations in the invariant measures seem to prevent an approach to the hydrodynamic limit problem based on the application of classical methods going through one- and two - block estimates @xcite .",
    "instead , broadly speaking , the proof of our result follows a scheme that is similar to that of @xcite for the ginzburg - landau model , that builds on an extension of the so - called @xmath33 method first introduced by chang and yau @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to prove that the time - derivative of the @xmath34 distance between the solution of the pde and the randomly evolving interface is non - positive in the infinite volume limit .",
    "there are however important differences between the application of the method to the ginzburg - landau model and to ours , and here we mention two of them ( see also remark [ rem : noriesz ] ) .",
    "first of all , one of the key points in @xcite is an a - priori @xmath34 control of interface gradients out of equilibrium , see lemma 4.1 there , which is based on a simple coupling argument , that works because the interaction potential is assumed to be strictly convex . in our case the analog would be an a - priori control of the variable we call @xmath35 in , that determines how long particles can jump .",
    "the coupling argument however does not work , probably because the interaction in our model _ is not _",
    "strictly convex , as witnessed by the fact that the position of a particle given its neighbors is uniformly distributed in the equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , we have to proceed differently to get tightness of @xmath35 , see e.g. proposition [ prop : contrk ] .",
    "secondly , the fact that the mobility is constant for the ginzburg - landau model played an important role in @xcite and was behind the fact that the time derivative of the @xmath36 distance between the randomly evolving interface and the solution of the deterministic hydrodynamic equation is negative .",
    "in fact , the negativity of this derivative is basically a consequence of convexity of the surface tension , see ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 5.7 ) ) and subsequent discussion .",
    "contraction of the @xmath36 norm holds also for our model but it seems to be more subtle , as it requires the negativity of a certain function ( cf . ) , a fact that _ does not _ follow simply from a thermodynamic convexity .",
    "our result raises interesting questions that we leave for future research : notably , the study of space - time correlations of height fluctuations around the limit pde and the proof of the convergence to the hydrodynamic limit when boundary conditions are not periodic , especially when boundary conditions are such as to impose frozen regions in the equilibrium macroscopic shape @xcite .      in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce more precisely our model and we state our main result , theorem [ th : main ] : the convergence of the height function to the solution of an explicit deterministic equation .",
    "this equation is of parabolic , non - linear type and in section [ sec : pde ] we deduce existence and regularity of its solution ( i.e. statement ( i ) of theorem [ th : main ] ) from known results on parabolic pdes .",
    "sections [ sec : dlt ] to [ sec : calcolo ] , that are the bulk of the work , contain the proof of item ( ii ) in theorem [ th : main ] , i.e. the hydrodynamic limit convergence statement itself .",
    "a short reader s guide to the structure of the proof is given at the end of section [ sec : model ] .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the infinite planar honeycomb lattice and let @xmath37 be the unit vectors depicted in figure [ fig : interlac ] .",
    "the dual lattice @xmath38 is a triangular lattice .",
    "we let @xmath39 be the periodization , with period @xmath30 , of @xmath27 in directions @xmath40 .",

    "dimers are interlaced : for instance , type-3 ( i.e. , horizontal ) dimers @xmath45 are interlaced with type-3 dimers @xmath46 . in this drawing",
    "there are exactly @xmath44 dimers of types @xmath20 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 dimers of type @xmath49 ( dimers , such as @xmath50 , at edges that differ by translations by @xmath51 with @xmath52 should be counted only once).,width=340 ]    on @xmath41 we introduce coordinates @xmath53 with @xmath54 by assigning coordinates @xmath55 to an arbitrarily fixed vertex of @xmath41 ( the `` origin '' ) and letting @xmath40 have coordinates @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "note that the `` unit vector '' @xmath58 has then coordinates @xmath59 .    the bipartite graph @xmath39 has @xmath60 vertices and every perfect matching @xmath61 of @xmath39 contains exactly @xmath62 edges .",
    "edges in a perfect matching @xmath61 are called dimers and @xmath61 is referred to as a dimer covering .",
    "we will say that an edge ( or a dimer ) is of type @xmath63 if it is parallel to the edge crossed by @xmath64 .",
    "the set @xmath65 of all perfect matchings of @xmath39 can be decomposed according to the number of dimers of the three types , as follows .",
    "given @xmath66 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , let @xmath70 be the set of perfect matchings of @xmath39 with @xmath71 dimers of type @xmath72 .",
    "note that the number of dimers of type @xmath49 is then constrained to be @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the translation by @xmath53 .",
    "we recall a few known ( and easy to verify ) facts :    1 .   given the locations of all dimers of a given type @xmath75 , the whole dimer covering @xmath61 is uniquely determined .",
    "in the following , we will call dimers of type @xmath49 ( i.e. the horizontal ones ) `` particles '' .",
    "the positions of particles in a vertical column of hexagons are interlaced with those in the two neighboring columns .",
    "more explicitly , if there is a particle at an horizontal edge @xmath76 and another at the edge @xmath77 for some @xmath78 ( note that @xmath45 are on the same column ) , then for @xmath79 there is a particle at an edge @xmath80 , for some @xmath81 .",
    "see figure [ fig : interlac ] and [ fig : ip ] .",
    "similar interlacement conditions hold for dimers of type @xmath20 and @xmath47 .",
    "3 .   every cycle of length @xmath30 on @xmath41 in direction @xmath64 crosses the same number of dimers of type @xmath82 ( and therefore @xmath83 of them ) .",
    "this is a consequence of property ( 2 ) .",
    "we introduce a height function @xmath84 ( defined on @xmath41 , i.e. on hexagonal faces of @xmath39 ) for configurations @xmath85 .",
    "we first need some notation :    [ def : ai ] given @xmath86 and @xmath63 , let @xmath87 be the edge ( necessarily of type @xmath82 ) of @xmath39 that is crossed by the edge of @xmath41 that joins @xmath88 to @xmath89 .    then",
    ", we establish :    [ def : height ] for every @xmath90 we set @xmath91 and @xmath92    the height function is well defined , i.e. the sum of the gradients along any closed cycle is zero .",
    "indeed , when the cycle has trivial winding numbers around the torus @xmath41 it suffices to verify that the total height change is zero along any elementary cycle of the type @xmath93 in this case , the height change is @xmath94 because exactly one of the three crossed edges , that share a common vertex , is occupied by a dimer and @xmath95 .",
    "when instead the cycle winds once around @xmath41 following direction @xmath64 , then the height change is zero because exactly @xmath96 dimers of type @xmath82 are crossed ( property ( 3 ) above ) .",

    "also , with respect to @xcite we multiply transition rates by @xmath62 , in order to avoid rescaling time in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "recall from the previous section that the configuration @xmath61 is fully determined by the positions of the @xmath106 dimers of type @xmath49 , or particles .",

    "this transition has also rate @xmath115 .",
    "observe that as soon as there are at least two particles in each cycle in direction @xmath58 ( which is certainly the case in our setting for @xmath30 large , since such number is @xmath117 and we assume that @xmath118 tends to a positive constant ) , a particle @xmath108 can not reach the same position via a jump by @xmath119 as with a jump by @xmath120 . therefore , even if we are on the torus it makes sense to distinguish between `` upward '' and `` downward '' particle jumps .",

    "* lemma 1 ) ) .",
    "we will formulate a hydrodynamic limit result for the height function .",

    "setting the natural choice is to fix the height at the origin to be the `` integrated current at time @xmath121 '' ( which is zero at initial time ) :    [ def : j ] for @xmath86 and @xmath126 we define the integrated current @xmath127 as the number of particles that cross @xmath88 downward minus the number of particles that cross @xmath88 upward in the time interval @xmath128 $ ] .",
