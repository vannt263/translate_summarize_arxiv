    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in iron - based compounds triggered a tremendous amount of experimental and theoretical research .",
    "in general terms one can divide these materials into two classes .",
    "the first is based on iron - pnictogen fepn@xmath0 planes , which have to be intercalated with some spacer atoms .",
    "the second class is built up by charge - neutral iron - chalcogenide fecn layers , where cn can be s , se , or te .",
    "superconductivity in this ` 11 ' family was first reported by hsu _",
    "et al._,@xcite with a transition temperature of @xmath1k for @xmath2-fese@xmath3 .",
    "the properties of this material can be further modified by pressure,@xcite excess fe or se deficiencies .",
    "another interesting route is alloying fese and fete yielding the family of fese@xmath4te@xmath5 superconductors@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the high - temperature superconducting cuprates , whose parent compounds are mott insulators , the question about the strength of correlations in the iron - based superconductors is not settled .",
    "fese@xmath5 has been studied with angular - integrated photoemission ( pes ) in refs .",
    "[ , ] , while angular - resolved photoemission studies ( arpes ) have been performed on fe@xmath6te@xcite and fese@xmath4te@xmath5 ( with @xmath7 in [ ] and @xmath8 in [ ] ) .",
    "for all these compounds , these experiments reveal a significant iron bandwidth narrowing , by a factor in excess of @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , recent arpes experiments on fese@xmath4te@xmath5 with @xmath8@xcite report large mass enhancements deduced from the low - energy fermi velocities , ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , while a smaller enhancement ( in the range @xmath12 ) was reported for fe@xmath6te@xcite .",
    "specific heat measurements@xcite for fete@xmath13se@xmath14 gave @xmath15mj / molk@xmath16 , whereas for fese@xmath17 a smaller value @xmath18mj / molk@xmath16 was reported.@xcite    band structure calculations based on density - functional theory ( dft ) of fese and fete have shown@xcite that the one - electron band structure of these materials is similar to the other iron - based superconductors , as regards the fe-@xmath19 states around fermi level .",
    "however , a recent first - principles calculation of the screened coulomb interactions gave significantly higher values for the 11 compounds.@xcite dynamical mean - field ( dmft ) calculations at @xmath20  albeit within the iterative perturbation theory ",
    "could reproduce some aspects of the experimental results , by taking the interaction as a parameter.@xcite given the experimental controversies , further insight from ab initio theoretical predictions , in comparison with experiments , is needed in order to characterize the role of correlations for the 11 family relative to other iron superconductors ( e.g. the 1111 family as lafeaso ) .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the correlation effects on the electronic structure of @xmath2-fese in the framework of dmft , using numerically exact monte carlo simulations and taking into account the full rotationally invariant coulomb interactions , evaluated from first principles .",
    "we find that this material displays clear evidence of strong correlations .",
    "first , our results demonstrate that the satellite feature observed in pes at a binding energy of about @xmath21 ev@xcite should be interpreted as a lower hubbard band of iron origin .",
    "second , we find that three of the iron orbitals are characterized by a rather low quasiparticle weight , and short quasiparticle lifetimes .",
    "these features indicate deviation from conventional fermi liquid behavior possibly associated with the formation of local moments controlled by the hund coupling .",
    "the possible occurence of local moments in multi - band systems was discussed in a model calculation@xcite and for 1111 pnictides@xcite for parametrized interaction strengths .",
    "the situation in the 1111 is subtle .",
    "however , taking the interaction strenght calculated from first priciples , lafeaso shows moderate correlations.@xcite here , on the contrary , our present calculations with ab initio interactions strongly suggest that correlation effects are most clearly revealed in the 11 family .",
    "we make theoretical predictions for the arpes spectrum of fese .",
    "significant deviations from the dft band - structure are found , which do not simply amount to an overall bandwidth narrowing .",
    "a downward shift of the hole - like bands near the @xmath22-point and an upward shift of the electron - like bands near the m - point are found .",
    "although arpes has only been reported at this stage for fese@xmath4te@xmath5 , this is consistent with the trends reported for these alloys.@xcite",
    "our calculations use the recent implementation of the combined dft - dmft method in a full - potential augmented plane wave electronic - structure framework@xcite based on the wien2k package.@xcite localized wannier - like orbitals are constructed from an energy window comprising the fe-@xmath23 bands and the se-@xmath24 bands , calculated in the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we use the tetragonal crystal structure , space group @xmath25 , as reported by margadonna _",
    "et al._,@xcite using the experimental value for the se position in the unit cell .",
    "a many - body self - energy , computed from dmft using a strong - coupling continuous - time quantum monte carlo algorithm,@xcite is applied to the subspace spanned by the fe-@xmath23 orbitals .",
    "the matrix of coulomb interaction parameters is calculated from first principles using the constrained random - phase approximation ( crpa),@xcite as applied to the iron - based superconductors in refs .",
    "all screening transitions are included , except the ones within the fe-@xmath23 manifold . in the notation of refs .",
    "[ ] this corresponds to the so - called @xmath19-@xmath26 construction . in order to avoid an orbital dependent double - counting correction",
    ", we do not use the calculated interaction matrices directly .",
    "instead , we follow the procedure described in ref .  [ ] and use the orbitally - averaged coulomb interactions . for fese ,",
    "this yields a local coulomb integral @xmath27ev and a hund s coupling @xmath28ev .",
    "this is to be compared with the significantly smaller values @xmath29ev , @xmath30ev for lafeaso.@xcite please not that the definition of @xmath31 is used here in terms slater integrals , and hence differs from the definition of @xmath31 in refs .",
    "we will show that the inclusion of the full rotationally - invariant hund s coupling ( including spin - flip and pair - hopping ) is crucial for fese .",
    "if not otherwise specified , all calculations were performed at a temperature @xmath32k using the fully - localized - limit double counting.@xcite spectra were obtained from the imaginary - frequency monte carlo data using the stochastic maximum entropy method.@xcite     ( color online ) comparison of the total lda dos ( black ) to the spectral function obtained with dmft ( red ) .",
    "lhb denotes the lower hubbard band .",
    "the inset shows the evolution of the lhb as a function of @xmath33 , with @xmath31 scaled accordingly ( @xmath34 , 1.1 , 1.3 , respectively . ) ]     ( color online ) orbital - resolved comparison of the density of states between the lda ( thin black ) and dmft ( thick , red ) results .",
    "the orbitals in the bottom row show strongest correlations .",
    "note the lhb in the @xmath35 orbital . ]",
    "in fig .  [ dostot ] , we compare the total momentum - integrated spectral function obtained within lda and within dmft .",
    "a substantial bandwidth reduction is obtained for the fe-@xmath19 states near the fermi energy .",
    "furthermore , the se-@xmath36 ligand states are shifted to larger binding energies as compared to lda .",
    "in addition , there is a structure appearing at a binding energy between @xmath37 and @xmath21ev . in order to identify the physical nature of this peak , we performed calculations for larger interactions . for computational efficiency",
    ", the calculations for varied @xmath33 and @xmath31 were done here with density - density interactions only .",
    "non density - density terms affect mostly the quasiparticle states and little the lhb .",
    "it is obvious from the inset of fig .",
    "[ dostot ] that the peak shifts towards larger binding energies with increasing @xmath33 , which is the expected behavior for a lower hubbard band ( lhb ) , and distinguishes it from a low - energy quasi - particle excitation .",
    "the existence of a lower hubbard band is nicely consistent with experimental pes results .",
    "independent measurements on fese@xcite revealed a broad feature at a binding energy of about about @xmath21ev .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that the photon - energy dependence of this peak ( labeled ` b ' in fig .  1 of ref .  [ ] ) indicates that it is of fe-@xmath19 origin .",
    "given our theoretical results , we propose that the feature observed in refs .  [ ] in this range of binding energies should be interpreted as a lower hubbard band . to our knowledge , this is indeed the first observation of a lower hubbard band in iron - based pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors .",
    "indeed , the shoulder at about -1.5 ev observed in pes for lafeaso in ref .   can be explained from band theory .",
    "we also note that the position of the se-@xmath36 bands agrees well with the experimental peak positions of @xmath38 and @xmath39ev , corresponding to peaks c and d in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "our results reveal a marked orbital dependence of the correlation effects , with significantly stronger correlations for the three orbitals @xmath35 and @xmath40 , while the @xmath41 and @xmath42 orbitals display weaker correlations .",
    "our conventions for the @xmath43 axis are rotated by 45 degrees as compared to the crystallographic axis , so that the @xmath35 orbital in our definition is the one pointing from fe to se .",
    "the three orbitals displaying stronger correlations are thus the ones which form the peak of the lda - dos ( and hence have higher weight at the fermi level ) , while the two other ones display a ` pseudo - gap ' in the lda dos . in fig .",
    "[ partdos ] , we plot the spectral functions of each fe-@xmath19 orbital , calculated for the same parameters as before . it is apparent that the lhb discussed above is visible mostly in the @xmath35 and @xmath40 partial dos .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath44 , which  in a fermi liquid ( see however below )  can be interpreted as the quasiparticle weight , and the inverse single - particle lifetime @xmath45 of each orbital .",
    "we find that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 orbitals yield larger quasiparticle weights @xmath46 , @xmath47 and longer lifetimes ( corresponding to @xmath48 of order @xmath49ev at @xmath32k ) .",
    "in contrast , a linear fit to the slope of the self - energy for @xmath50 orbitals would yield lower values of the weights @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "however , the rather short lifetimes ( corresponding to @xmath53ev and @xmath54ev ) shed serious doubt on the validity of a coherent quasiparticle interpretation for those orbitals .",
    "a further decrease of the temperature from @xmath32k to @xmath55k does not reduce @xmath56 . in order to identify coherent quasi particles",
    "the temperature has to be lower than the width of the quasi - particle , i.e. @xmath57 . here @xmath58 for the @xmath35 orbital corresponds to 440k , which is higher than 290 or 190k and , hence , no coherent quasi - particle can be expected .",
    "we checked that changing the double counting to `` around - mean - field''@xcite even increases the incoherence ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we elaborate in more detail on this unconventional metallic state further at the end of this paper",
    ". the stronger degree of correlations in fese , compared to lafeaso , @xcite , manifests itself also in the partial charges of the fe-@xmath19 electrons .",
    "due to electronic correlations , the electron charge diminishes from 6.37 in lda to 6.07 within lda+dmft , which should be compared to the values for lafeaso of 6.40 ( lda ) and 6.28 ( lda+dmft ) .",
    "please note that these changes do _ not _ correspond to any doping effect , since the total electron count of the crystal is still integer .",
    "it is merely a redistribution of charges due to changes in the hybridisation between the fe and the ligand atoms .",

    "comparison of the low - energy spectral function , projected to orbital character , of dft ( left ) to the dft+dmft results ( right ) .",
    "top row : @xmath35 orbital .",
    "bottom row : degenerate @xmath60,@xmath61 orbitals . ]",
    "we have also calculated the momentum - resolved spectral function along high - symmetry directions , displayed in fig .",
    "[ akwtot ] and compared to the lda bandstructure .",
    "these results can be viewed as predictions for future arpes experiments on pure fese .",
    "they can also be compared qualitatively with available arpes data,@xcite bearing in mind however that those actually concern the te - substituted compound fese@xmath4te@xmath5 .",
    "the overall renormalization of the bands and the band - width reduction are apparent .",
    "the inverse lifetime ( @xmath62 ) increases rapidly with increasing frequency , which results in rather broad structures below -0.3ev .",
    "the dmft quasiparticle bandstructure can not be deduced from a mere rescaling of the lda bandstructure .",
    "the strong orbital and energy dependence of the self - energy renormalizes the effective crystal - field splitting between the orbitals , resulting in differential shifts of the quasiparticle bands near the fermi level .",
    "an interesting effect is seen for example near the @xmath22 point . in lda",
    ", one can see essentially only two dispersing hole - like bands , the outermost band being quasi - degenerate . by introducing correlations ,",
    "this degeneracy is lifted , and we can see three hole - like excitations around the @xmath22 point .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with arpes.@xcite we also observe that the hole pockets near the @xmath22-point are pushed downwards in energy by correlation effects , while the electron - like ones near the m - point are pushed upwards , in agreement with the arpes spectra presented in refs .",
    "[ ] the orbital character of the lda+dmft bands , see fig .",
    "[ akwproj ] , reveals that the outermost band around @xmath22 and the electron pocket around m are dominantly of @xmath35 character , which displays the largest effective mass in our calculations , see above .",
    "this is again in qualitative agreement with arpes , where the heaviest masses were associated to the outermost hole pocket and the electron pocket .",
    "furthermore , the broader feature at around -0.3ev is of @xmath41 character , consistent with experiment .    within the dmft approach used in the present work ,",
    "the effective mass enhancement of electrons in a given orbital @xmath63 is related to the inverse of the weight @xmath64 calculated above .",
    "this suggests effective mass enhancements in the range @xmath9 for the @xmath65 orbital to @xmath66 for the @xmath67 one .",
    "direct comparison of these values to experiments is difficult in the absence of arpes data for fese .",
    "arpes measurements on fese@xmath4te@xmath5@xcite have been interpreted as yielding very large effective masses ( @xmath68 between 6 and 23)@xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the much larger specific heat coefficient reported for these alloys,@xcite in comparison to fese.@xcite it should also be kept in mind that the precise extraction of effective masses ( renormalized low - energy fermi velocities ) from arpes data by comparison to the dft band structure is subject to rather large uncertainties , especially in view of the orbital - dependent shifts of the bands induced by correlations ( see above ) .",
    "difference of the total dos when calculated using the full 4-index @xmath33-matrix ( black ) and density - density interactions ( red ) .",
    "for both calculations : @xmath69ev , @xmath28ev . ]    considering the full rotationally - invariant hund s coupling@xcite is crucial to describe properly the low - energy physics of fese . including only density - density interactions",
    "drastically suppresses the quasi - particle at low - energies ( see fig .",
    "[ comphund ] ) , rendering the system much more incoherent for the same value of parameters , as reflected in high scattering rates @xmath70 in the range @xmath71 . in this case",
    "also , lowering the temperature ( here , down to @xmath72k ) does not reduce the scattering rates .",
    "an increase of the coulomb parameters by even 50% does not drive the system to a mott - insulator : at @xmath73ev , @xmath74ev there is still finite spectral weight at the fermi level .",
    "we increased @xmath33 further to @xmath75ev which finally leads to insulating behavior .",
    "taken together , our results for both rotationally invariant and density - density interactions reveal that there is region of the @xmath76 parameter space , where the system is in a state which is neither a fermi - liquid , nor a mott insulator .",
    "this region in parameter space looks similar to the selective localisation found in refs .",
    "[ ] , although we do not find one mott - localised orbital , but instead three incoherent orbitals .",
    "this is also consistent with recent reports within dft+dmft calculations based on exact diagonalisation for lafeaso@xcite and fese.@xcite    this suggests that fese is just beyond the transition from the fermi - liquid phase to an intermediate bad - metallic phase , and could be a realization of the spin - freezing scenario.@xcite indeed , the response to an external magnetic field increases significantly , when this phase is entered ( for instance by tuning @xmath31 ) , whichs reveals the formation of localised moments .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the rather large values of the resistivity measured even on single - crystal samples@xcite and with nmr@xcite and neutron scattering experiments@xcite suggestive of strong spin fluctuations .",
    "we have presented strong theoretical and first - principles evidence for enhanced electronic correlation effects in fese .",
    "we have identified a hubbard satellite in the spectral function , large orbital - dependent mass enhancements ranging from 2 to 5 , and -importantly - large quasi - particle damping effects that may render a fermi liquid description of the normal state of fese invalid over a wide temperature range . concerning the momentum - resolved spectral function",
    ", we find very good agreement with recent arpes measurments .",
    "in addition to the mass enhancement , we found that a correlation induced crystal - field splitting is important to describe size and position of the hole and electron pockets at the @xmath22 and m point of the brilloiun zone , respectively .",
    "as argued in ref .",
    "[ ] , a simple scaling of the lda bands is not enough to account for the measured electronic structure .",
    "the present orbital - sensitive non - fermi liquid behavior further indicated by their sensitivity to the hund s coupling may serve for understanding the interplay between the spin - charge - orbital dynamics and superconductivity in iron superconductors .",
