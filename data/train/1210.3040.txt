    "a plethora of practical applications have arisen due to the study of quantum information theory . this study has also produced equally interesting insights into physics questions of a fundamental nature .",
    "of particular relevance to this paper is the recent progress made in the study of quantum information theory in relativistic settings @xcite .",
    "when an observer undergoes uniform acceleration , the appropriate coordinate system to use is known as rindler coordinates .",
    "this coordinate system contains two causally disconnected domains .",
    "the minkowski vacuum of the field observed by our accelerated observer will be populated with particles .",
    "this phenomenon , known as the unruh effect , demonstrates the relative nature of the vacuum @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps even more startling that the unruh effect causes decoherence .",
    "hence when an entangled state is observed by an accelerating observer , it appears to have less entanglement .",
    "that is , due to the unruh effect , the amount of entanglement a state has is also relative to the observer @xcite . here",
    ", we demonstrate another surprising result : that the structure of the effective state space of a qubit is also relative to who is observing it .",
    "rindler coordinates are an appropriate coordinate system for describing an observer subject to uniform acceleration . in minkowski coordinates ,",
    "the world lines of an accelerated observer correspond to hyperbolas that asymptote to null trajectories on either side of the origin .",
    "the tangents to these asymptotes intersect at the origin and form two causally disconnected regions to the left ( region i ) and right ( region ii ) of the origin @xcite . alsing and milburn considered this situation with two observers , alice and rob , each holding an optical cavity capable of supporting two orthogonal modes .",
    "alice is a minkowski observer and rob undergoes uniform acceleration . at a certain event ,",
    "rob s frame is instantaneously at rest , the two cavities overlap and an entangled state is created as rob accelerates away .",
    "alice then attempts to teleport a state to rob , but this process is disrupted by the unruh effect .",
    "it is then shown that the fidelity of rob s final state with alice s initial state degrades due to acceleration @xcite . however , as schutzhold and unruh pointed out , the presence of cavity walls block the radiation resulting from the unruh effect and there are various other conceptual difficulties with this approach @xcite .",
    "therefore we instead consider a situation where alice and rob s modes are the modes of a free scalar field @xcite .",
    "the fields can be massive @xcite or massless @xcite as this will not affect the mathematical form of our results .",
    "we are therefore making an approximation where only the main contributing mode of a wave packet is considered @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that this single - mode approximation is indeed valid in certain physical situations @xcite .    in sec . [ setup ]",
    "we explain our model of quantum information with non - orthogonal states subject to the unruh effect . in sec .",
    "[ two ] we calculate the entanglement , perform a teleportation protocol and discuss distinguishability within our model . in each case",
    "we show that there exist non - orthogonal states that outperform orthogonal states for quantum information given a particular non zero value of acceleration .",
    "we will then calculate the bures metric of the effective qubit derived from the modes of a scalar field in the limit of low accelerations and demonstrate its deformation in sec . [",
    "three ] before concluding in sec . [ four ] .",
    "in this section we will develop a simple model of quantum information with non - orthogonal states subject to the unruh effect .",
    "the non - orthogonal basis we consider is @xmath0 .",
    "these states can be expressed in the number occupation basis as @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . here",
    "@xmath3 is a parameter that determines the degree to which @xmath4 is non - orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "note that for @xmath6 , @xmath7 is orthogonal to @xmath4 .",
    "the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( 1)(2 ) are written in the number occupation basis , so it is implicitly assumed that alice and rob share a reference frame for phase @xcite . following the approach of other authors we ignore the specific details of the reference frame henceforth @xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we are considering the modes of a free scalar field .",
    "the modes of a scalar field are an infinite level system from which a qubit can be prepared @xcite . following the approach that is common in the literature",
    ", we consider the entanglement of two qubits where rob s qubit is subjected to the unruh effect @xcite .",
    "as such we will encode in a non - orthogonal basis for rob only .",
    "we therefore consider the entangled state , @xmath8 , shared by our initially inertial observers , alice and rob , where @xmath9 and @xmath10    rob then undergoes uniform acceleration , hence we must consider the quantization of a scalar field in rindler space ( which is not the same as in minkowski space ) . by using unruh s famous result",
    "we can express the minkowski space vacuum state in terms of region i and region ii modes as follows @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 and regions i and ii denote the two causally disconnected regions in rindler space . here @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the frequency of the rindler particle and @xmath15 is its acceleration .",
    "similarly the minkowski space one - particle fock state can be written in terms of the modes of region i and ii as @xmath16    since the two regions are causally disconnected , the effective state of the system can be found by tracing over the field modes in region ii .",

    "provided that @xmath41 is a pure state , @xmath40 can be quantified by the overlap @xmath42 .",
