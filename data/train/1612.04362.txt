    "plasma diagnostics in both laboratory and astrophysical settings relies principally on spectroscopic and polarimetric methods of observation , where the radiation emitted from the plasma is analyzed as a function of wavelength and state of polarization .",
    "these allow one to determine important properties of the observed plasma , such as bulk and turbulent velocity fields , gas composition and density , existence of anisotropic processes such as the presence of directed electric and/or magnetic fields , and anisotropic sources of irradiation and of colliding particles .    particularly in the case of low density gases ,",
    "collisional processes can be of such modest magnitude that the excitation state of the plasma is typically far away from local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) . in that case , the excitation and de - excitation processes that are responsible for the observed radiation may be statistically correlated , so that the system is able to preserve a `` memory '' of the excitation conditions . a typical example is the partially coherent scattering of radiation , where the frequency of the outgoing photon is correlated ( via an intrinsically second - order atom ",
    "photon process ) to the spectral distribution of the incoming radiation , leading to the phenomenon of partial redistribution of frequency .",
    "these excitation conditions are rather common in low - density astrophysical plasmas , such as the higher layers of the solar atmosphere , planetary nebulae , and interstellar regions , where outstanding spectral lines of the observed spectrum ( e.g. , the first few lines of the lyman and balmer series of hydrogen , some lines of neutral sodium , and of singly ionized calcium , etc . )",
    "are known to be formed in conditions of strong departure from lte , which may often also include the effects of partially coherent scattering of radiation .    in this paper , we derive the redistribution function in the laboratory frame for the polarized three - term atom of the @xmath0-type , i.e. , for the transition system @xmath2 such that @xmath3 by energy ordering ( see figure  [ fig : lambda - model ] ) .",
    "this model can be used to investigate , for example , the formation of the system of transitions comprising the k and h lines and the infrared ( ir ) triplet of the solar spectrum @xcite .",
    "the expression we arrive at corresponds to the extension of the well - known @xmath1 redistribution function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the case of a three - term atom that can harbor atomic polarization in all of its levels , including those of the lower ( metastable ) states . in applications where plasma collisions are important in determining the statistical equilibrium of the atomic system ,",
    "this expression is still useful as it provides the correct contribution to the total emissivity of the plasma from radiation scattering .",
    "as long as the collisional lifetime of the metastable states is much longer than the _ total _ lifetime of the upper state , the approximation of sharp lower levels remains applicable in practice , and our expression of @xmath1 can then be used , with proper weights , alongside with @xmath4 , to completely describe the radiative and collisional redistribution of radiation in the modeled atmosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "-type , for an incoming photon of frequency @xmath5 and an outgoing photon of frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the model atom considered in this paper is restricted to the case where all @xmath7 and @xmath8 levels are sharp ( i.e. , metastable ) . however , all the levels involved can be non - degenerate .",
    "[ fig : lambda - model ] ]",
    "we rely on previously published work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , paper  i ) on the redistribution function for the polarized two - term atom in order to develop the framework for the generalization of @xmath1 to the case of a three - term atom of the @xmath0-type , undergoing the two - photon transition @xmath2 ( see figure  [ fig : lambda - model ] ) .",
    "the bases for this generalization were laid out in a recent paper @xcite , where we showed how the radiative transfer equation describing the polarized line formation in a two - term atom in the presence of partially coherent scattering ( equations ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) of paper  i ) naturally extends to the case of the multi - term atom of the @xmath0-type ( equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of @xcite ) .    in practice ,",
    "the main complication in deriving the redistribution function for the three - term atom comes from allowing @xmath9 for the final state @xmath8 ( here @xmath10 is the total width of the level @xmath11 due to all possible relaxation processes ) , and from the need to assume generally different thermal widths for the two transitions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "accordingly , we introduce a characteristic doppler width @xmath14 for the atomic transition between two generic terms @xmath15 and @xmath16 with energy @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "we indicate with @xmath19 the bohr frequency of such transition .    for each scattering event ,",
    "the angle @xmath20 between the propagation directions of the incoming and outgoing photons is an essential parameter of the laboratory frame redistribution function .",
    "we introduce the associated quantities @xmath21 and follow @xcite for the choice of the cartesian reference frame for the projection of the thermal velocity of the plasma .",
    "this coincides with the frame adopted in paper  i ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when the thermal widths of the two transitions are identical ( i.e. , when the terms @xmath22 and @xmath8 have the same energy ) .",
    "accordingly , we define for the @xmath0-type transition @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 we note that equations ( [ eq : avg_doppler ] ) and ( [ eq : xi ] ) imply @xmath26    we define next the complex profile function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the complementary error function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the voigt and faraday  voigt functions , along with the dimensionless frequency variables @xmath31 the incoming and outgoing radiation frequencies , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are expressed in the laboratory frame of reference , and they differ from the corresponding frequencies in the atomic frame of rest because of the thermal motion of the atoms ( see appendix of paper  i ) .",
    "we also introduce normalized damping parameters associated with the inverse lifetimes of the transition levels , using the same `` reduced '' doppler width of equation ( [ eq : avg_doppler ] ) @xmath34 in the presence of pressure broadening , the numerator of equation ( [ eq : variables.2 ] ) should be augmented by the corresponding collisional inverse lifetime .",
    "we note in passing that the proposed normalizations ( [ eq : variables.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : variables.2 ] ) differ from the one adopted in paper  i , where instead the frequency and inverse lifetimes pertaining to a given transition were normalized to the doppler width for that transition .",
    "the choice adopted here is dictated exclusively by convenience , as it significantly simplifies the form of the resulting expressions .",
    "following the approach of paper  i , appendix  a , we find that we can perform the integration over two of the three components of the thermal velocity in the adopted reference frame . accordingly , after some algebra , the redistribution function of the polarized three - term atom of the @xmath0-type can be written in the following integral form @xmath35 where we have indicated with @xmath36 the complex conjugate of @xmath37 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rlab ] ) transforms exactly into equation ( a6 ) of paper  i when @xmath38 ( and letting @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , noting that equation ( [ eq : avg_doppler ] ) gives @xmath41 , in such case , using the notation of paper  i.    in order to facilitate further manipulation of equation ( [ eq : rlab ] ) for specific applications , it is convenient to introduce barred quantities @xmath42 . thus equation ( [ eq : rlab ] ) becomes @xmath43 we then define @xmath44 from which ( see equation ( [ eq : cool ] ) ) @xmath45 when @xmath46 or @xmath47 , the coefficient of @xmath48 in one of the two definitions ( [ eq : x.y.def ] ) vanishes . , but in that case the problem becomes identical to the one for the two - term atom @xcite .",
    "] however , the relation ( [ eq : ganzo ] ) , on which we rely for the following development , remains valid .",
    "using these two definitions , we then can rewrite at last @xmath49 this is the starting point for the derivation of the redistribution function for the model atom considered in this paper .",
    "in order to treat the case of a @xmath0-type atom undergoing the transition @xmath2 , where the initial and final terms are metastable , we must consider the limit @xmath50 of equation ( [ eq : rlab.bar ] ) , using the identity @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the dirac delta and the cauchy principal value distributions . in general , we will assume that the initial lower term is polarized and carrying atomic coherence ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) .",

    "this result is in agreement with equation ( 16 ) of paper  i. in particular , it shows that the additional integral term in equation ( [ eq : r.final ] ) , which is generally non - vanishing in the presence of lower - term coherence , is purely a term of frequency redistribution that carries no net energy .",
    "this can also be seen directly from equation ( [ eq : r.final ] ) , by integrating that term over @xmath32 .",
    "since that variable only appears in the argument of the dawson s integral , which is an odd function , the integration over @xmath32 makes each of the two contributions in that term to vanish . in particular",
    "this implies that the integral term of equation ( [ eq : r.final ] ) brings no contribution when the atom is illuminated by a spectrally flat radiation .",
    "figure  [ fig : int_term ] also provides a numerical demonstration of this result , since the integrals over @xmath76 of the curves in the upper panel all converge to @xmath153 , whereas the curves in the lower panel all have zero integral ."
