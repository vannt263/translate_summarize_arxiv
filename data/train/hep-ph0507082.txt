    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is a lively subject in particle physics and the determination of its entries that govern all flavor changing transitions of quarks and leptons in the standard model is an important task for both experimenters and theorists .",
    "the large interest in the subject is also reflected by the workshops organized in the last years whose main subject was the ckm matrix@xmath1 , one of the main goals of these gatherings being global fits to the ckm matrix parameters .",
    "the usual method for doing that is the so called standard unitarity triangle approach that make use of the orthogonality property between the first column and the third one of the recommended form for the ckm matrix , see refs .",
    "recently@xcite , we have proposed a unitarity condition method for constraining the ckm matrix entries , method that fully exploits the unitarity properties of ckm matrix , it is an exact one , its use does not depend on any approximation , and can be applied to both quark and fermion sectors .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to make a comparison between the two approaches alluded to the title , and for doing that we reformulate the standard unitarity triangle method by requiring that the triangles sides have to depend on four measurable quantities .",
    "the measurability property was first raised by jarlskog@xmath2 who has shown that in the @xmath3-flavors case only the functions that depend on the moduli @xmath0 and/or the `` angular looking objects '' @xmath4 are re - phasing invariant and _ measurable_. we remark that the common _ four _ independent parameters used in the standard unitarity triangle approach are @xmath5 and the phase @xmath6 , see refs .",
    "6 - 8 and the references cited therein , where the notations are the well - known ones .",
    "concerning @xmath6 it is not seen as being directly measurable , at least in a single - type experiment , even it enters in a measurable quantity , the jarlskog invariant @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 expression suggests that the `` natural '' four independent parameters to be used in any global fit have to be the moduli .",
    "thus in the following we will always use as parameters _ four _ independent moduli @xmath0 , and in particular we will provide another measurable expression for @xmath6 .",
    "that choice allows us to find a simple criterion for the separation of double stochastic matrices from the unistochastic ones , problem that to my knowledge was not yet considered in the physical literature , and its fulfillment is the key point in any global fit of the ckm entries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we find the gauge group of unitary matrices , i.e. the group of elementary transformations whose action on the unitary matrices does not change their unitary properties and physical content . in sec . 3",
    ", we expose the unitarity condition method@xcite and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for discrimination between the doubly stochastic matrices and the unitary matrices .",
    "we show that the unitarity condition is a very strong one and doing a global fit is not an easy matter . in sec .",
    "4 , we reformulate the standard unitarity triangle approach@xmath9 by using in all formulas only measurable quantities . in sec . 5",
    ", we present a comparison between the two approaches , and we conclude in sec . 6 .",
    "the @xmath10-generations ckm matrix is assumed to be unitary , and it depends on @xmath11 parameters which are usually taken as @xmath12 angles and @xmath13 phases , each set taking values in @xmath14 $ ] , and respectively , @xmath15 .",
    "very soon@xcite it was realized that by a redefinition of quark fields , the elements of the first row @xmath16 unitary matrix can be made positive .",
    "that observation was formalized as follows : the `` encoded '' physics in the ckm unitary matrix is invariant to multiplication at right and/or left by diagonal phase matrices @xmath17diagonal@xmath18 , see e.g. refs .",
    "10 , 15 and 16 , because we can redefine the quark fields phases .",
    "that means that we have at our disposal @xmath19 phases whose values can be chosen by us , and the common choice is @xmath20 and/or @xmath21 . for a non - standard choice in the @xmath3-dimensional case",
    "see ref 17 . that leads to @xmath22 independent phases and @xmath12 independent angles that parametrize a unitary matrix .",
    "here we rise a novel problem : are there other _ elementary _ transformations of unitary matrices under which their physical properties do not change ? .",
    "besides the left and/or right multiplication by diagonal phase matrices there is another transformation : multiplication at left and/or right by permutation matrices .",
    "permutation matrices are matrices whose elements on each row and each column are zero , but one that equals unity .",
    "they interchange columns and , respectively , rows between themselves .",
    "both the diagonal phase matrices and permutation matrices are subgroups of unitary matrices .",
    "if @xmath23 is a diagonal phase matrix and @xmath24 a permutation matrix then @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the adjoint , and @xmath27 is the @xmath10-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "another equivalent unitary matrix can be obtained by taking the transpose of the original one , and if we would require that both the matrices should have similar forms after such a transformation , the kobayashi - maskawa form@xcite will be the compulsory choice , and not the usual one@xcite .",
    "we can also apply the complex conjugation to all its entries , and all its physical properties do not change . if we denote by @xmath28 the transpose and by @xmath29 the complex conjugation , these transformations form a subgroup of each other",
    "because @xmath30 in conclusion the product group @xmath31 is the gauge invariance group of unitary matrices , i.e. the physical content remains invariant by applying a number of the above transformations to a given unitary matrix .",
    "the @xmath29-invariance has an important consequence : the range of all the @xmath32 independent phases is @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "in the following we make use of the rephasing invariance property and multiply the recommended form for ckm matrix@xcite at left and , respectively , at right by the diagonal phase matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and obtain the form that will used in the following @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the generation labels @xmath39 , and @xmath6 is the phase that encodes the breaking of the @xmath40-invariance .",
    "the above form depends on _ four _ independent phases , the phases of @xmath41 , instead of _ fives _ in the usual form .",
    "these four phases can be considered as four fundamental frequencies , and their knowledge is equivalent to the knowledge of all the @xmath42 entries , see e.g. ref .",
    "the above model has to be supplemented by experimental data that are usually supplied by experimenters under the form of a positive entries matrix @xmath43 more generally , the experimental data are given in terms of some functions @xmath44 , that depend on the @xmath45 entries .",
    "for defining a theoretical model we need also a linking relation between the above two objects , and we propose @xmath46 the previous equation is equivalent to the following relations @xmath47 the main theoretical problem is to see if from a matrix as ( [ pos ] ) one can reconstruct a unitary matrix as ( [ ckm ] ) . for",
    "that we make use of the unitarity relation @xmath48 to obtain from the relations ( [ unitary ] ) the _ weakest _ form of unitarity @xmath49 for the moment we assume that the entries of @xmath45 are such that the relations ( [ sto ] ) are exactly satisfied ; then the set ( [ sto ] ) is known as _",
    "double stochastic matrices _ , and the subset @xmath50 is known as _ unistochastic matrices_@xcite .",
    "the constraints ( [ sto ] ) are necessary but not sufficient for unitarity , where from we infer that we need a separation criterion between the two sets .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we will choose four independent parameters to work with , and our choice is @xmath51 using the exact doubly stochasticity of @xmath45 we form the real matrix @xmath52 and observe that @xmath53 is double stochastic .    making the identification @xmath54 in relation ( [ unitary ] )",
    "we find expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath56@xcite , the last one being given by @xmath57 showing that @xmath56 is a measurable quantity being expressed in terms of four moduli .",
    "the separation criterion between double stochastic and unistochastic matrices is given by the physical condition @xmath58 that is equivalent to @xmath59 relation that describes the physically admissible region in the 4-dimensional space generated by the moduli @xmath60 .",
    "this result shows that four independent moduli do not always determine a unitary matrix , even when the moduli satisfy the relations ( [ sto ] ) ; this happens then and only then , when the relation ( [ unit ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the above relation separates the unitary matrices from the doubly stochastic ones in our choice of independent moduli .",
    "the form ( [ cosd ] ) changes when we change the choice ( [ choice ] ) .",
    "relations that have to be satisfied for fulfilling unitarity have also been found in ref .",
    "23 but unfortunately they were not taken into account by the ckm fitter community .",
    "relations ( [ sto ] ) being exactly satisfied we can compute @xmath56 and check if the physical condition ( [ unit ] ) is satisfied . if it is , then the experimental data are compatible with the form ( [ ckm ] ) and we can easily reconstruct it from the data ( [ pos ] ) . if the physical condition is violated there is no compatibility and the story ends here .    however , the experimental data are not known with infinite precision to see if the relations ( [ pos ] ) are exactly satisfied . the data being affected by errors , what could we do in that situation ?",
    "there is the place where the gauge invariance group of unitary matrices enters the game .",
    "the gauge invariance group ( [ gauge ] ) tell us that there is a `` democracy '' within the ckm matrix entries , all of them enjoying the same `` rights '' , and by consequence our choice freedom does not amount to the choice ( [ choice ] ) .",
    "it is a combinatorial problem to find all the _ four _ independent moduli groups , and in fact there are only 58 such groups that lead to 165 different expressions for @xmath56 .",
    "depending on the explicit group one gets one , two , three or four different expressions for @xmath56 .",
    "the huge number for @xmath56 is a consequence of the data errors and comes from the fact that neither relations ( [ sto ] ) are exactly satisfied , nor @xmath56 values are equal , nor in the physical region ; all these three conditions have to be simultaneously satisfied in order to find a unitary matrix .",
    "if the data are exactly known and satisfy the relations ( [ sto ] ) all the 165 expressions give a single number .",
    "for example with the choice of rational numbers @xmath61 that are almost identical with the values recommended in@xcite , the @xmath62 matrix ( [ dbl ] ) is doubly stochastic and one gets @xmath63 although two conditions , the double stochasticity property and the equality of @xmath56 are exactly satisfied , the physical condition ( [ unit ] ) is not , so the above numbers are far away from numbers coming from a unitary matrix . if we change only one value and take @xmath64 , we find @xmath65 .",
    "this simple test could say that the recommended value @xmath66 is highly improbable to be true and has to be changed .",
    "however we have to wait and see what the experiments will tell us !    to see that the condition ( [ unit ] ) is constraining , we did a monte carlo simulation for ( [ cosd ] ) using as input the pdg data @xmath67 , i.e. the values recommended in ref .",
    "20 , and the results are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the results show that only a tiny fraction of simulated data are in the physical region and , by consequence , a global fit is not easy to be done . for similar numerical results",
    "see ref . 24 .    in the case of approximate data",
    "the explicit form for @xmath56 depends on the independent four parameters we choose to parameterize the data and also on the parameters entering the last four equations in ( [ unitary ] ) that provide in general different expressions for @xmath56 , i.e. the numerical values are in general different @xmath68 .",
    "in that situation we have to provide a @xmath69test that has to take into account the double stochasticity property expressed by the conditions ( [ sto ] ) and the fact that in general the data are such that @xmath56 may take different numerical values even for those @xmath56 coming from a definite choice of the four independent parameters , and more , the numerical values could be outside the physical range @xmath70 .",
    "my proposal is @xmath71 we stress that the relation @xmath72 holds true for both double stochastic and unitary matrices , and only the physical condition @xmath73 discriminates between them such that it has to be compulsory satisfied .",
    "the second component of the @xmath74-test has the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 are theoretical functions depending on @xmath77 , @xmath78 are the measured experimental data for @xmath76 , and @xmath79 is the vector of errors associated to @xmath80 .",
    "the formula @xmath81 is our phenomenological tool for analyzing the experimental data .",
    "unitarity triangle approach exploits another consequence of the unitarity property eq.([unitarity ] ) , namely the six orthogonality relations of rows and , respectively , columns of a unitary matrix@xmath82 .",
    "its root is in the pioneering work by wolfenstein@xcite where he proposed a relationship between the theoretical object @xmath42 and the experimental data available then , its nice feature being the possibility to _ estimate the order of magnitude _ for all @xmath42 entries at a time when the experimental data were very scarce .",
    "usually one considers only the orthogonality of the first and the third columns of @xmath42 , relation which is written as @xmath83 the main reason for that choice is the structure that arise in ( [ ort ] ) by applying the wolfenstein parametrization and keeping only the leading non - vanishing terms .",
    "however , there is another orthogonality relation that has the same structure , that given by the orthogonality of first and third rows @xmath84 that was never used in phenomenological analyzes .",
    "the above relations can be represented as triangles in the complex plane .",
    "the other four relations are neglected because the triangles have a flattened form in the complex plane . to see how the relation ( [ ort ] )",
    "has been exploited till now , see refs . 7 , 8 , 25 and 26 , and the references cited therein .",
    "the relations ( [ ort])-([ort1 ] ) are scaled by dividing them through the middle term such that the length of one side is 1 .",
    "the other sides have the lengths    @xmath85    for eq.([ort ] ) , and respectively @xmath86 for eq.([ort1 ] ) . on the right hand side",
    "we have written the @xmath87-values in our choice for independent parameters ( [ choice ] ) by supposing that the relations ( [ sto ] ) hold . in this case",
    "we can compute the numerical values on the right hand side and see if they form a triangle .",
    "if they do , one computes their angles and the above triangle provide us _ two _ independent re - phasing invariant angles . if the computed values do not form a triangle , i.e. they do not satisfy the inequality @xmath88 ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations for @xmath89 and @xmath90 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "they tell us that there are no problems with @xmath91 $ ] . concerning @xmath90",
    ", it takes values in the range @xmath92 $ ] and only @xmath93 are positive ; trying to satisfy the inequalities ( [ unit1 ] ) one finds that only @xmath94 of them are in the physical region .",
    "the difficulties come from @xmath95 and @xmath96 , that lead easily to imaginary values because @xmath97 , and from the smallness of @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the usual approach",
    "they are approximated by @xmath100 , and , respectively , by @xmath101 , because @xmath102 , etc .",
    ", such that the imaginary values are never seen .",
    "similar to the unitarity condition method , when the data are not exactly known , we have to calculate all the @xmath103 forms corresponding to the 58 groups of four independent moduli . with the choice",
    "@xmath104 one gets    @xmath105    which is quite different from ( [ tri1 ] ) , so we have to require @xmath106 and respectively @xmath107 .",
    "similar to the preceding case the problem is caused by @xmath108 that takes imaginary values because @xmath109 is quite large , and the determination of the two ratios ( [ tri2 ] ) is difficult . in this case of standard",
    "unitarity triangle one can define a @xmath69test as follows @xmath110    also we have to consider all the six orthogonality relations on the same footing and we have to include this information in the form ( [ chi-3 ] ) .",
    "the necessity for doing that comes from the fact that _ one _ orthogonality relation provides only _ two _ rephasing invariant angles . or",
    "it is well known@xcite that there are necessary _ four _ such angles for a complete determination of a unitary matrix .",
    "unfortunately the beautiful paper@xcite had no echo among the people working on global fits to the ckm matrix entries .",
    "similar to the preceding method @xmath111 can be used as a @xmath74-test for the standard unitarity triangles approach . in principle both",
    "the approaches , unitarity condition method and unitarity triangles method , have to give the same results modulo small errors .",
    "since some fitting methods could provide numerical values for all @xmath112 , the unitarity test @xmath113 has to be checked .",
    "doing a global fit for the ckm matrix entries is not easy at all .",
    "the difficulty comes from the formulas ( [ cosd ] ) , ( [ tri1]),([tri3 ] ) , ( [ tri2 ] ) and those similar to , that lead to unphysical values and we have to find numerically safe methods to satisfy the physical constraints ( [ unit ] ) and/or ( [ unit1]).concerning @xmath6 the monte carlo simulations , see fig.1 , show that the overwhelming majority of its values lies outside the physical region ( [ unit ] ) . for other choices of the independent parameters , @xmath56 can even take imaginary values as happens when on computes it by using central @xmath0 values published in some fits@xcite .",
    "a similar situation arises for @xmath89 and/or @xmath114 .",
    "fig.2 shows that @xmath90 takes negative values in @xmath115 cases , i.e. @xmath114 gets imaginary .",
    "that happens because @xmath97 .",
    "if we try to fulfill also the condition ( [ unit1 ] ) then the number of physical events is around @xmath116 , i.e. of the same order of magnitude as for @xmath56 .",
    "perhaps it is a matter of taste to consider that it is numerically easier to satisfy the relation ( [ unit ] ) and more difficult to implement the inequalities ( [ unit1 ] ) ; perhaps it comes from my dissatisfaction concerning the current use of the unitarity triangles approach .",
    "the main reason for looking for an alternative approach to global ckm fitting techniques is that there is no simple relation between the parameters defined by wolfenstein@xcite , @xmath117 , and directly measurable quantities .",
    "the weakness of wolfenstein parametrization was intuited many years ago by branco and lavoura@xcite , but , unfortunately , it was not fully exploited , although they gave a wolfenstein - type parametrization with _",
    "four moduli!_. their proposal was to choose another parameter , @xmath118 , instead of the usual one @xmath119 , the first being more relevant to @xmath120mesons physics and a _ measurable _ quantity@xcite .",
    "of course , in principle , @xmath6 is measurable , see the relation ( [ cosd ] ) that expresses @xmath56 through measurable quantities , but until now it can not be measured in a _",
    "single _ experiment ; we have to use data from many different experiments to obtain its value .",
    "a similar situation is that of measuring the jarlskog invariant @xmath8@xcite that depends on @xmath121 .",
    "as concerns the nowadays use of the unitarity triangle method@xcite , in my opinion , its main drawback are the approximations @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and similar to , for other choices of the independent parameters . in some happy situation as for example when the range of one @xmath89 is positive , see e.g. the case ( [ tri1 ] ) , one can `` control '' @xmath114 to obtain reasonable values for some physical quantities , even if @xmath114 can take imaginary values",
    ". however the problem is not simple and obtaining a physical result requires a very precise matching between the involved parameters .",
    "if we look at the triangle inequality ( [ unit1 ] ) we easily see that the equality @xmath124 is excluded since @xmath125 , for @xmath126 around the measured values .",
    "a physical solution is possible if their difference @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 and @xmath99 are strongly correlated taking values in a small window ; see@xcite for a similar result .",
    "on the other hand the global ckm fits practitioners , see e.g. refs .",
    "28 - 30 , use expressions as @xmath129 that are not sensitive to such small variations of @xmath128 and @xmath99 parameters . in the second case ( [ tri3 ] )",
    "both @xmath87 can take imaginary values and they can not be `` guessed '' with enough precision for a reasonable fit , and we think that this is the real reason why the second unitarity triangle is not used , although both of them have the same magnitude in @xmath130@xcite . however , since one unitarity triangle provides only two invariant angles , we need to use at least two such triangles for the determinations of other two invariant angles for a complete determination of the ckm unitary matrix@xcite .",
    "in the paper we have shown that the unitarity condition method@xcite and the unitarity triangles method@xmath82 are both a consequence of the assumed unitarity property for the ckm matrix . in the same time",
    "we have reformulated the second method such that the parameters @xmath103 should depend on _ four _ measurable quantities , namely four independent @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that in the real case of approximate experimental data we have to use the gauge invariance property of unitary matrices for imposing all possible constraints implied by the unitarity property .",
    "for example the parameterizations @xmath131 and @xmath132 have to be treated on the same footing , and have to lead to the same physics .",
    "we provided @xmath69tests for both the methods under the form ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ chi-3 ] ) , forms that are imposed by the errors that affect all the experimental data , and by the gauge invariance group of unitary matrices .    by monte carlo simulations",
    "we have shown that the unitarity property requires a very fine tuning between all the ckm matrix elements , and our proposed test for unitarity implies the fulfillment of two conditions @xmath133 and @xmath134    in our formulation both the methods are exact , they do not depend on any assumptions concerning the smallness of some parameters and can be used for global fits in both the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "last but not least we made a clear distinction between the theoretical model given by the matrix @xmath42 , and the experimental data matrix @xmath45 , problem that is generally overlooked .",
    "the unitarity is _ assumed _ and _ built _ in the parametrization of the ckm matrix @xmath42 , but the results of the fits _ could violate the unitarity _ as the monte carlo simulations and the numerical examples in section 3 prove ; see also@xcite , where the central values published in@xcite led to a few imaginary values for @xmath56 . in this sense",
    "the most important result for global fits of the ckm matrix entries is the separation criterion between the double stochastic matrices and unistochastic ones , problem that , to my knowledge , was not considered until now in the physical literature , so much the less by the ckm fitting community .",
