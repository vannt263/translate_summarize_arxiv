    "the optimization of transition - state structures ( tss ) is key to the understanding of mechanisms and kinetics of chemical reactions on a computational basis .",
    "transition states are defined as first - order saddle - point structures located on the minimum ( reaction ) energy path between reactants and products .",
    "first - order saddle points are characterized by one negative eigenvalue of the matrix of second partial derivatives of the electronic energy with respect to the cartesian nuclear coordinates , i.e. of the hessian .",
    "reactants and products are local minima on the born  oppenheimer potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "the energy differences between a ts and two minima of an elementary reaction are the activation energy barriers .",
    "they should in principle be evaluated from the gibbs free energy , but are approximated here , as in most quantum - chemical studies , by the electronic energy at zero kelvin ( neglecting temperature and entropy contributions ) .",
    "numerous methods have been developed to efficiently find tss .",
    "examples are interpolation methods @xcite , eigenvector following ( evf ) @xcite , string methods @xcite , and the scaled hypersphere search method @xcite .",
    "the existing ts search methods can be divided into those that start from one structure ( often called single - ended methods ) or those that require at least two starting structures , usually reactant and product structures ( double - ended methods ) .",
    "double - ended ts search algorithms are often based on interpolation methods such as linear ( lst @xcite ) or quadratic synchronous transit ( qst @xcite ) , string methods or nudged elastic band ( neb @xcite ) algorithms .",
    "since the double - ended methods usually show slow convergence near a ts @xcite , they are mainly employed to find a guess structure close to the ts , which is then refined by a more efficient single - ended method , such as evf .",
    "hence , it is beneficial to combine single - ended and double - ended methods for ts searches .    in most of the evf - based methods , the full hessian of the transition - state guess structure is calculated to obtain the exact vibrational mode to follow . for large molecules",
    ", the complete hessian calculation is computationally demanding as the calculation of the elements of the hessian matrix is very time consuming within a first - principles electronic - structure description .",
    "therefore , several algorithms have been developed to circumvent the calculation of the full hessian in structure - optimization algorithms .",
    "a quasi - newton  raphson method has been introduced by broyden.@xcite in this method , an approximate hessian is built from gradients only and then updated ( according to bofill @xcite and powell @xcite ) by the gradients of intermediate points obtained during the optimization .",
    "these methods reduce the computational effort significantly , but for large molecules a further reduction of the computational cost is desirable .",
    "recently , sharada et al . @xcite introduced an approximate - hessian approach based on the tangent of the transition - state guess structure determined by an interpolation between reactant and product structures and by local curvature information .",
    "this approximate hessian approach combined with the growing string method turned out to be computationally less expensive than previous hessian approximations.@xcite    since the efficiency of a ts search depends strongly on the initial hessian , a main goal is to set up an approximate hessian matrix that resembles the exact one as closely as possible . in 2002 , we proposed an algorithm based on davidson subspace diagonalization for the selective calculation of eigenvectors of the mass - weighted hessian based on predefined molecular distortions.@xcite this so - called mode - tracking scheme turned out to be very efficient in vibrational spectroscopy @xcite . because of the straightforward and flexible implementation",
    ", mode - tracking was implemented in a semi - numerical fashion.@xcite at the same time , deglmann and furche @xcite presented an implementation of a fully analytical davidson subspace diagonalization of the hessian for the optimization of its lowest eigenvalue required for the identification of stationary points .    very recently , sharada et al .",
    "@xcite described a semi - numerical davidson subspace iteration method to obtain selected information of the hessian spectrum , which is identical to mode - tracking @xcite . for transition - state optimizations , sharada et al.@xcite extract the guess mode from the coordinates along the pathway obtained from the freezing - string method ( fsm ) .",
    "in contrast to the hessian approach presented by sharada et al .",
    "@xcite , we here develop a mode - tracking - based ts and minimum localization algorithm that can iteratively refine a specific eigenvector of interest , which does not have to be the one with lowest eigenvalue .",
    "our algorithm can be executed in an explorative fashion as we can circumvent the neb or fsm calculation by starting from only one minimum - energy structure and by following several eigenvectors in one optimization in parallel .",
    "we will demonstrate these capabilities at the example of the isomerization reactions of formaldehyde , which has been studied as a benchmark system for automated transition - state search algorithms @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we investigate an internal proton - transfer reaction in a hydrazine complex , which is an intermediate in the schrock n@xmath0-fixation catalytic cycle.@xcite at this example , we examine the applicability of our algorithm for finding tss for large molecules ( the schrock catalyst contains 284 atoms ) . although smaller model complexes can be generated , the smallest ones , which resemble the structure of the original catalyst , still comprise 41 atoms .",
    "we choose these examples to highlight the capabilities of the mode - tracking - based approach to ts searches , which improves on existing methods rather than proposing a new ts search algorithm .",
    "hence , validating the performance of our mode - tracking version of existing ts search algorithms at standard ts test sets @xcite is neither needed nor necessary .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the mode - tracking algorithm and the theoretical background of transition - state optimizations are described .",
    "after the subsequent computational methodology section , results are reported for our benchmark reactions .",
    "the main idea of the algorithm to be described is to find transition - state structures by following only certain eigenvectors of the hessian matrix selectively calculated by mode - tracking . for stationary structures , the harmonic vibrational frequencies and the corresponding eigenvectors of a system",
    "can be obtained by solving the following eigensystem ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the mass - weighted cartesian hessian , @xmath3 are the eigenvalues , and the eigenvectors @xmath4 are the mass - weighted vibrational normal modes . for non - stationary structures ,",

    "if the initial guess vector differs strongly from the normal mode of the transition - state structure , the second option might be more suited to find a ts .",
    "the eigenvector following algorithm @xcite is then employed to steer the optimization into the direction of the ts and to finally locate it .",
    "raphson steps along the converged mode - tracking eigenvector , which is referred to as transition vector , are carried out to maximize the energy in this direction , while in all directions orthogonal to the transition direction the structure is relaxed @xcite .",
    "for this , we project out the gradient along the transition vector , @xmath36 , from the total molecular gradient ,    @xmath37    to obtain the components of the molecular gradient that are orthogonal to the eigenvector , @xmath38 , we subtract the gradient part along the transition vector from the original molecular gradient and obtain    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the selected eigenvector calculated with mode - tracking , which approximately points into the direction of the ts .",
    "this is done in no - mass - weighted coordinates .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the coordinates of the targeted stationary point , for which @xmath43 vanishes component - wise , and @xmath44 . from a truncated taylor series expansion of the potential energy around @xmath45 on the pes ,",

    "@xmath53 can be split into a direction parallel to the transition vector , @xmath54 , and into all other directions .",
    "the step in the direction of the transition vector reads @xmath55 the energy in direction of the selected mode is maximized if @xmath41 is negative .",
    "if we do not start the evf procedure from a structure close to the ts , but , for instance , from a minimum structure , we must ensure that the transition vector is still followed uphill .",

    "we implemented the theory presented in the previous section in a computer program called mtsearch .",

    "mtsearch is a parallelized meta - program that accesses standard quantum - chemical programs for the calculation of gradients and electronic energies .",

    "we read in initial guess structures and , if available , initial modes .",
    "the initial guess modes and structures can either be created within mtsearch , from a lst or an neb path , or by an external program , which provides guess structures and modes , e.g. , based on a constrained optimization scan .",
    "the lst or neb path consists of six to twelve nodes ( that is , molecular structures on an ( approximate ) reaction path , including reactants and products ) , which we found to be a reasonable number .",

    ", and such a calculation is considered converged when the difference between the gradient norm of the actual iteration and the previous one drops below 1@xmath6610@xmath67 a.u .",

    "we should note that we provide data for the eigenvalues of the hessian as frequencies ( reported in units of wave numbers ) .",

    "we start with the investigation of the rotational barrier in the c@xmath0h@xmath75 molecule , because the transition - state structure is well defined and the system is small , which allows us to investigate the suitable settings and thresholds for mtsearch .",
    "next , we analyze the possibility of mtsearch to optimize several transition - state structures starting from one minimum - energy structure using hydroxymethylene as an example .",
    "the last two reactions considered are possible side reactions of the chatt ",

    "exemplarily , we have chosen one possible side - reaction pathway , where one proton of n@xmath0h@xmath76 coordinated to molybdenum shifts to one of the amido nitrogens .",

    "our focus is the optimization of transition - state structures for the proton - transfer reaction in the small and large schrock catalysts .",
    "we first calculated the transition - state structure of ethane rotation from staggered conformation to eclipsed conformation and back to staggered conformation . to obtain starting structures and initial guesses for the mode - tracking scheme",
    ", we performed a linear synchronous transit in internal coordinates with six nodes on the path including reactant and product structures ( both staggered ) .",
    "since only one dihedral angle is changed during the transition from one minimum structure to the other , the choice of internal coordinates is very useful in this example . due to the symmetry in the lst path ,",
    "only three of the six structures are different .",
    "the first ( minimum ) , second , and third structures of the lst pathway were chosen as starting structures for evf procedures performed with mtsearch and , for comparison , turbomole .",
    "although the second structure of the lst pathway does not feature negative eigenvalues of the hessian , the evf algorithm optimization started from these structures converged towards the transition - state structure with both turbomole and mtsearch ( see supporting information for details ) .",
    "if we start from the energy minimum structure , evf relying on one negative eigenvalue is not able to find the ts , because the structure is far away from the quadratic region around the ts .",
    "therefore , one would usually start from a guess structure closer to the ts .",
    "by contrast , mtsearch locates the ts starting from the energy - minimum structure with a mode specified by the lst and by a manually chosen mode corresponding to the rotation of one ch@xmath77 group around the c@xmath63c axis .",

    "we analyzed the effect of various parameters on the convergence of mtsearch .",

    "if the starting structure is close to the energy minimum structure , the optimizer has to accomplish a larger step out of the minimum .",
    "we observed that a first newton  raphson step size of 1.01.5 /@xmath70 is appropriate ( see supporting information , section 2 , for details ) .",
    "next , we adapted the number of orthogonal optimization steps performed until the next mode is optimized by mode - tracking to values between 2 and 10 . to generalize the algorithm , we defined a protocol which stops the orthogonal optimization if the norm of the gradient for the optimization orthogonal to the transition path drops below 1@xmath6610@xmath67 a.u .",

    "however , this can be done automatically by calculating the overlap of the initial guess mode and the converged one .",
    "if the initial mode is not close to the transition vector , the optimization may lead to a different ts than the desired one ( in our case , the ts for a rotation of the terminal nh@xmath0 moiety of the n@xmath0h@xmath76 ligand was often found when the initial guess mode was not clearly dominated by the shifting proton ) .",

    "we choose as an initial guess mode the converged mode of the ts in the generic model complex ( after alignment of the large and small homologous complexes , and choosing only those entries for atoms that occur in both complexes ; all other entries are set to zero ) . due to the significantly larger system size",

    "the search for multiple reaction pathways starting from one minimum structure is still a main obstacle of current transition - state optimization programs . in general ,",
    "chemical intuition is needed to choose a suitable starting mode , which connects the reactants with the products .    in this paper , we presented an algorithm that efficiently combines the calculation of selected normal modes by the mode - tracking scheme@xcite and the eigenvector - following procedure to locate and optimize transition - state structures .",
    "since mode - tracking avoids the time - consuming calculation of the complete hessian matrix and instead only optimizes the modes of interest , mtsearch is particularly suitable for optimizing transition - state structures of large reactive molecular systems .",
    "the search for several transition - state structures is feasible and the starting structures for a search may lie outside the quadratic region of a transition - state structure .",
    "we investigated our algorithm at the example of four intramolecular reaction pathways : the rotational barrier of c@xmath0h@xmath75 , the isomerization of h@xmath0co , a proton shift in the hydrazine - bound intermediate of the [ mo(hiptn@xmath77n ) ] catalyst by schrock as well as in a model system with methyl substituents instead of the hipt substituents .",
    "initial guess modes for the mode - tracking procedure can be extracted either from an lst or neb pathway or based on chemical intuition .",
    "a ts optimization can be started either from two or from only one minimum - energy structure .",
    "the potential energy surface can be explored in a customized way along the desired directions . even for a large molecule such as the hydrazine - coordinating mo complex of schrock and coworkers with more than 200 atoms",
