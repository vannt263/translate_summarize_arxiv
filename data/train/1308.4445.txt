    "time - dependent quantum mechanics is used to calculate the response of systems to time - varying external potentials@xcite , but can be computationally demanding for many particles . among practical methods ,",
    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) excels as a computationally inexpensive method for dealing with the interactions between electrons in time - dependent quantum mechanics@xcite . in the last two decades ,",
    "use of tddft has grown tremendously , especially for calculations of transition frequencies of electronic excitations in molecules@xcite and solids@xcite .",
    "the relative computational ease with which tddft handles electron - electron interaction make it the only viable quantum tool for systems with several hundred atoms@xcite .",
    "but the validity of tddft relies on the celebrated runge - gross theorem@xcite which proves , under certain circumstances , that the time - dependent one - body potential of an interacting electronic system is a functional of the one - electron density .",
    "modern tddft calculations also use a kohn - sham scheme , in which fictitious non - interacting fermions are propagated in a time - dependent multiplicative potential , defined to reproduce the time - dependent density of the interacting system .",
    "use of such a scheme implicitly supposes that such a potential exists ( in technical jargon , that the density is non - interacting @xmath1-representable@xcite ) .",
    "ground - breaking work by van leeuwen@xcite showed that , under quite general assumptions , such a potential can always be found , apparently ending this question within tddft .",
    "however , nature can occasionally be both subtle and malicious .",
    "the runge - gross theorem assumes time - taylor expandability(@xmath2-te ) of the time - dependent potential , while van leeuwen s proof requires such expandability of the density also . in recent work@xcite",
    ", we gave a very simple , realistic case ( a hydrogen atom in a suddenly - switched static electric field ) in which the latter fails , thus reopening the issue of @xmath1-representability in tddft .",
    "this could only be done convincingly by creating a methodology for explicitly extracting the short - time asymptotic behavior in such cases , and demonstrating the non - expandability of the density .",
    "this has reopened the question of the existence of a ks potential in the common case of coulomb attraction to the nuclei , and recent work has focused on avoiding the taylor expansion in time@xcite .",
    "these results were quite unexpected , as they are due to the non - interchangeability of two commonly interchanged limits .",
    "in fact , as we demonstrate explicitly here , the time - dependent density in such cases , @xmath3 , has _ no _ well - defined short time expansion . for finite distances from a cusp ,",
    "one asymptotic expansion applies , while for distances less than @xmath4 from a cusp , a different expansion dominates .",
    "( atomic units @xmath5 are used throughout . ) a related statement is that we find the radius of expansion of the time - taylor series is 0 .",
    "however , even if the density has no well - defined expansion , integrals over the density , such as the time - dependent dipole moment , _ are _ well - defined , but can contain fractional powers of @xmath2 . here",
    "we give further examples of the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculating some of these quantities for several cases .",
    "we also show how these features appear in various alternative approaches to this problem .",
    "our work here is far from a complete analysis of these behaviors , and we make no attempt at a general treatment of this problem .",
    "instead , we merely scratch the surface of the very thorny issues created by the coupling between space and time in the schrdinger equation .",
    "we hope this work will inspire more comprehensive study of these questions , and perhaps lead to a more straightforward computational scheme .",
    "the paper is divided as follows .",
    "we begin by analyzing a very simple illustration , the 1d disappearing nucleus , from many different viewpoints .",
    "although this is not a three - dimensional coulomb potential problem , this illustration is chosen because we have closed analytic results .",
    "we next present the @xmath0-expansion as a general method for extracting the short - time behavior of these systems .",
    "we then revisit 1d .",
    "we check our method reproduces the analytic results of the disappearing nucleus problem , and show what it produces for a nucleus in an electric field . we then turn to 3d , applying the method to the two previous cases , but in 3d .",
    "there are specific complications for the h atom in an electric field . in the following section ,",
    "we examine the time - dependent dipole moment , rather than just the wavefunction , finding its behaviour entirely in the disappearing nucleus case , and partially in the electric - field problem .",
    "then we discuss more general potentials in space and time ( but not any general class of potentials ) .",
    "we close with a discussion of the implications of these results for many - electron systems and time - dependent density functional theory .",
    "here we study the failure of the taylor series in the simplest possible case , first studied in ref . @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "we begin at @xmath6 with a wavefunction : @xmath7 which has a cusp at @xmath8 .",

    "the original motivation for this study was concern about the fundamentals of time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft)@xcite . since the proof of a general theorem@xcite , the number of applications of tddft in chemistry and physics has grown phenomenally@xcite . in its standard form , tddft translates the many - electron problem into a fictious many - fermion problem _ without _ interaction between the particles , thereby greatly reducing the computational cost , and allowing calculations with several hundred atoms .",
    "while all such applications rely on approximate functionals , their validity as an alternative to solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation relies on several exact statements and the existence of exact functionals .",
    "the most basic requirement for construction of a formally exact density functional theory is a proof of uniqueness of the one - body potential that can give rise to a given density .",
    "the runge - gross theorem@xcite shows that , for a given initial wavefunction and electron - electron repulsion , there is at most one @xmath242 that can produce a given @xmath3 when solving tdse .",
    "thus @xmath242 is a functional of @xmath3 .",
    "applying the same logic to the fictitious ks system yields the td ks equations that can be applied to many - electron systems , once the many - electron effects are approximated in the mysterious exchange - correlation potential . a linear response analysis@xcite yields an extremely efficient scheme for calculating low - lying electronic excitations in molecules and solids@xcite .",
    "the proof of runge - gross was constructed only for one - body potentials that are analytic in @xmath2 , and can therefore be taylor - expanded about @xmath6 .",
    "the proof demonstrates that two distinct such potentials must give rise to densities whose @xmath194-th derivative at @xmath6 differ for some finite @xmath194 .    the present and previous@xcite work show that , in the case of a hydrogen atom in a suddenly - switched electric field , the time - dependent density has non - analytic contributions , so that the taylor series does not converge . nonetheless , if two densities differ in their @xmath159-th time - derivative , they must be different , even if neither matches its taylor expansion .",
    "thus the uniqueness proof of runge - gross remains valid even for such problems .",
    "this suggests these results apply to many - electron atoms , although they have only been proven for one - electron cases .",
    "if one considers the td ks equations for , e.g. , a he atom in a suddenly - switched field , in the region of the nucleus , the density , which is a sum of occupied orbitals , will contain the same features ( via the occupied @xmath243-orbital ) .",
    "however , this argument presupposes the _ existence _ of such a ks potential for this case .    even in the simpler ground - state dft",
    ", there are no general conditions on densities known that guarantee that a density is in fact a ground - state density for some electronic problem , although this is rarely a problem in practice , even for strongly correlated systems@xcite .",
    "a second important theorem in tddft was van leeuwen s constructive proof of the td ks potential . assuming both the density and the potential are taylor - expandable , a relatively simple procedure yields , power - by - power , a prescription for finding the potential@xcite .",
    "clearly , this theorem does not apply to the cases studied here .",
    "since all atoms , molecules and solids have cusps at their nuclei ( within the born - oppenheimer and point nuclei approximations ) , this theorem can not be applied as is to such cases .",
    "earlier work@xcite had already shown that such cases could be constructed in 1d , but these could be regarded as pathological .",
    "the motivation to develop the @xmath0-expansion described here was to convincingly show that such effects are generic , rather than unusual , once the ground - state wavefunction contains spatial cusps . in the last few years",
    ", much work toward a proof of existence of the ks potential without a taylor - expansion has been performed@xcite ."
