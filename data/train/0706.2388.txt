    "a primary goal of the polarized p+p program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the determination of the gluon polarization @xmath4 in the proton via spin asymmetry measurements in a variety of processes @xcite .",
    "inclusive processes such as neutral pion , charged pion , and jet production provide sensitivity to gluons through the dominant subprocesses @xmath5 and @xmath6 at low and intermediate @xmath7 . because of the difference in the sign of the polarization for up and down valence quarks , the difference of the measured asymmetries in the @xmath8 channel and the @xmath9 channel is sensitive to the sign of the gluon polarization in the @xmath7 range where @xmath6 contributions are sizable .",
    "these inclusive probes have only modest luminosity requirements and are natural first steps in longitudinal spin program .",
    "the unpolarized cross sections provide constraints on fragmentation functions and important validation of the nlo pqcd calculations used to interpret the measured spin asymmetries .",
    "the star experiment , with its large acceptance tracking and calorimetry , is uniquely capable of full jet reconstruction at rhic , allowing a direct study of fragmentation through the association of a detected @xmath0 with its parent jet .",
    "star detects neutral pions near mid - rapidity with its barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) via reconstruction of the invariant mass of photon pairs ; charged pions at high transverse momentum are identified in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) via their specific energy loss , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "for both these measurements , a trigger on the electromagnetic energy deposited in the calorimeter is crucial to select events with a hard initial scattering . for the present analyses two types of calorimeter triggers were used .",
    "the high tower ( ht ) trigger selects events with high energy deposition in one calorimeter tower ( @xmath11 ) , making this a good @xmath0 and photon trigger .",
    "the jet patch ( jp ) trigger selects events with significant energy deposited in a trigger patch of the calorimeter ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is used to trigger on the electromagnetic energy in a jet .",
    "each of these triggers is used with two different energy thresholds , referred to as ht1 , ht2 , jp1 and jp2 . to achieve high detector live - time for the highest energy triggers , the minimum bias ( mb ) , the ht1 , and the jp1 triggers are prescaled during data taking . for the 2005 run period ,",
    "only half of the bemc was fully installed and commissioned , giving a coverage of @xmath13 for all azimuthal angles @xmath14 .",
    "this limits the acceptance for calorimeter triggers and for neutral pion reconstruction in this run .",
    "the unpolarized cross sections for both neutral and charged pions have been discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "good agreement with nlo pqcd calculations @xcite over several orders of magnitude in the cross section has been observed for both particle species .",
    "these measurements consistently favor the kkp fragmentation functions @xcite over other sets .     in their associated jet as a function of @xmath7 .",

    "an association was made if the pion was within the jet cone of 0.4 in @xmath16 and @xmath14 . to avoid edge effects ,",
    "the analysis is restricted to @xmath17 . because other analyses have shown that calorimeter - only jets without any charged tracks are often associated with beam background , a maximum ratio of the neutral to total energy of 0.95 is imposed .",
    "the left side of figure [ fig : meanz ] shows the mean momentum fraction @xmath15 of neutral pions associated with jets for ht1 triggers as a function of the pion s @xmath7 .",
    "the momentum fraction is not corrected for acceptance , efficiency or resolution of the jet reconstruction .",
    "the mean momentum fraction of @xmath0 in electromagnetically triggered jets is approximately 0.75 , and rises slightly with @xmath7 , consistent with measurements of leading charged hadrons in jets in fixed - target experiments @xcite . also shown in this figure is the mean momentum fraction of neutral pions in jets in pythia @xcite simulations , both with jet finding on the pythia particle level , and with a full detector simulation in geant .",
    "the difference between these two gives an impression of the size of the detector and reconstruction effects on the mean momentum fraction .",
    "these effects are dominated by the jet reconstruction , since the momentum determination for neutral pions in the electromagnetic calorimeter is very precise .",
    "the simulation results suggest that resolution and reconstruction effects increase the observed @xmath15 by about 10% .",
    "the longitudinal double spin asymmetry is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the mean measured beam polarizations and @xmath20 is the ratio of integrated luminosities for equal and opposite beam helicities . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the particle yields in equal and opposite beam helicity configurations , respectively .",
    "the polarizations are obtained with the rhic polarimeters @xcite .",
    "typical polarization values during the run period were @xmath23 50% .",
    "the relative luminosities are monitored in star with the bbcs .",
    "typical @xmath20 values were around 1.1 .",

    "an overall normalization uncertainty of 9.4% , due to errors on the polarization values obtained with the rhic polarimeters , is not included .",
    "studies of parity - violating single spin asymmetries and randomized spin patterns show no evidence for bunch to bunch or fill to fill systematics . the grsv standard curve is based on the best fit to dis data ; the other curves show scenarios of extreme positive , negative and vanishing gluon polarizations .",

    "are modified by multiplying favored fragmentation functions by @xmath27 and unfavored ones by @xmath28 . the leading systematic error in this analysis",
    "is the trigger bias , because the events are triggered on electromagnetic energy deposition , while charged hadrons are analyzed .",
    "this is different from the @xmath0 case , where the trigger is directly sensitive to neutral pions . as in the case of the @xmath0 asymmetry ,",
    "the results are least consistent with the maximal positive gluon polarization scenario , but discerning among the other scenarios is limited by statistics",

    "the measured cross sections are found to be in good agreement with nlo pqcd predictions .",
    "the longitudinal asymmetries disfavor the maximal positive gluon polarization scenario , but currently have no resolving power among other scenarios due to limited statistics . with the large increase in sampled luminosity and polarization in the 2006 run",
