    "during the last two decades there has been performed a large number of experimental investigations of projectile - electron excitation and loss in collisions between relativistic highly charged ions and solid and gaseous targets . in particular , a variety of very heavy projectiles with the net charge @xmath3  @xmath4 a.u . were used in the experiments .",
    "the experiments have also covered a very large interval of impact energies ranging from comparatively low relativistic energies of @xmath5-@xmath6 mev / u @xcite-@xcite to extreme relativistic energy of @xmath7 gev / u @xcite-@xcite where the projectile velocity already only fractionally differs from the speed of light @xmath8",
    "most of the data , however , have been collected for impact energies not exceeding a few hundreds of mev / u . for impact energies above @xmath9 gev / u there",
    "exists just a few experimental results .",
    "they include the data on the electron loss from @xmath10 gev / u au@xmath11(1s ) ions penetrating solid targets @xcite-@xcite and on the electron loss from @xmath7 gev / u pb@xmath12(1s ) ions colliding with solid @xcite and gaseous @xcite targets .",
    "besides , one should also note that the experimental data on the elementary cross sections in collisions at very high energies collected using solid targets are not very accurate .",
    "the loss cross sections , reported for @xmath7 gev / u pb@xmath12(1s ) projectiles penetrating solid and gas targets differ between themselves roughly by a factor of @xmath13 ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this difference , as was recently explained in @xcite , lies in multiple collisions suffered by the projectiles when they move in solids which does not allow one an accurate experimental determination of the values for elementary ion - atom cross sections . in the case of @xmath10 gev",
    "/ u au@xmath11(1s ) ions the data of @xcite and @xcite , which were both collected for collisions with solid state targets , also differ by about of a factor of @xmath13 ( but the reason for this is not completely clear ) .    concerning difficulties in the theoretical description of the ion - atom collisions ,",
    "there should be mentioned two main points , which complicate the treatment of the projectile - electron excitation and loss : the presence of atomic electrons and the fact that in case of collisions with a heavy atom the atomic field may be too strong making it necessary to go beyond the first born approximation .",
    "the latter point is known to be of extreme importance when considering the projectile - electron excitation and loss processes occurring in collisions of very highly charged ions with heavy atoms at relatively low impact energies @xmath14 ",
    "@xmath15 gev / u , where the difference between experimental data and first born calculations reaches an order of magnitude . at such energies , however ,",
    "the atomic electrons play only a minor role in the projectile - electron transitions and their presence can simply be neglected @xcite .",
    "with increase in the impact energy the role of the higher order effects in the projectile - target interaction diminishes . nevertheless , even at energies well above @xmath9 gev",
    "/ u the first born approximation tends to substantially overestimate transition probabilities and the accuracy of first born results for cross sections remains unclear , especially in the case when the collision causes more than one electron of the projectile to undergo transitions .",
    "besides , at such impact energies even for the most highly charged projectiles ( like e.g. hydrogen - like uranium ions ) the influence of the electrons of the atom on the projectile - electron transitions can no longer be ignored @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall demonstrate that the so called symmetric eikonal ( se ) model , extended to account for the presence of atomic electrons , can be used for treating the projectile - electron excitation and loss in collisions with heavy atoms at impact energies @xmath16 gev / u . in particular , we will show that in the limit of asymptotically high impact energies the transition amplitude , derived in the se model , coincides with the amplitude obtained in the light cone approximation which means that the se model provides essentially an exact solution for the problem of projectile - electron excitation and loss in extreme relativistic ion - atom collisions .",
    "the forthcoming upgrade of the heavy - ion facilities at gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) will allow one to perform extensive experimental explorations of the different aspects of heavy ion ",
    "atom collisions at impact energies in the range @xmath17  @xmath18 gev / u .",
    "it will be seen below that in this range of impact energies the se model represents a very valuable tool for describing the projectile - electron excitation and loss in collisions with very heavy atoms .",
    "atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise stated .",
    "depending on whether or not the electrons of the atom are active in the collision , one normally distinguishes two atomic modes ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) which can contribute to the projectile - electron transitions . in one of them , which is often called _",
    "screening _ , the electrons of the atom act coherently with the atomic nucleus screening ( partially or fully ) the field of the latter .",
    "the other mode , in which the atomic electrons actively participate undergoing transitions , is termed _",
    "antiscreening_. in this mode the behavior of the projectile - electron is influenced mainly by the electrons of the atom while the nucleus of the atom plays only a minor role @xcite .    in collisions with heavy atoms , which are of special interest for the present article ,",
    "the antiscreening mode is much weaker than the screening one and below will not be considered . in the screening mode the field of the atom can be regarded as external that enables one to reduce a many - electron problem of the ion - atom collision to a problem of the motion of the electron of the projectile in two external fields : the field of the nucleus of the ion and the field of the atom .",
    "the latter is taken as a superposition of the field of the atomic nucleus and the field of the atomic electrons whose space distribution is assumed to be frozen during the very short collision time @xcite .    in the rest frame of the ion",
    "the electron is described by the dirac equation @xmath19 the hamiltonian @xmath20 reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hamiltonian for the electron motion in the field of the ionic nucleus and @xmath23 is the interaction between the electron and the field of the atom . in the above expressions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the dirac s matrices , @xmath26 coordinates of the electron with respect to the ionic nucleus , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the scalar and vector potentials of the electromagnetic field of the incident atom .",
    "the field of the atom in its rest frame is described by the scalar potential which , using results of @xcite and @xcite , can be taken as @xmath29 where @xmath30 with the screening parameters @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that in the rest frame of the ion the atom moves along a classical straight - line trajectory @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the impact parameter and @xmath36 the atomic velocity . using eqs.([e5])-([e6 ] ) and the lorentz transformation for the potentials we obtain that in the rest frame of the ion the potentials of the atomic field are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the collisional lorentz factor and @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    within the se model",
    "the transition amplitude is approximated by @xmath41 where the initial and final states of the electron , whose motion in the field of the ionic nucleus is affected by the field of the atom , are chosen according to @xmath42 here , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the initial and final undistorted states of the electron in the ion .",
    "making use of the fact that the dependence of the scalar potential @xmath27 on the electron coordinates and time is of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 the transition amplitude ( [ eic - new-1 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the electron transition frequency and @xmath49 denotes the two - dimensional ( in the @xmath50-plane ) gradient operator .",
    "the amplitude ( [ eic - new-3 ] ) can be simplified by employing the relation @xmath51 that yields @xmath52      if the interaction between the electron of the ion and the atom is sufficiently weak one can replace the exponent @xmath53 in ( [ eic - new-5 ] ) by @xmath9 . then integrating in ( [ eic - new-5 ] ) by parts over the space and using the continuity equation @xmath54 for the transition charge and current densities , @xmath55 we obtain @xmath56 taking into account that @xmath57 and @xmath58 we arrive at the transition amplitude @xmath59 which coincides with expression for the amplitude obtained in the first born approximation .",
    "an important question , which will be addressed in this subsection , concerns the high - energy limit ( @xmath60 ) of the se model . keeping in mind",
    "that @xmath61 one can show that @xmath62 where at the moment the explicit form of the function @xmath63 is not important . correspondingly , @xmath64 at sufficiently large impact energies , where the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath66 essentially vanishes",
    ", we can replace the amplitude ( [ eic - new-5 ] ) by the following expression @xmath67 we now take the second line of ( [ h - e-3 ] ) , integrate there by parts , use the continuity equation ( [ eik-1order-1 ] ) and then again integrate by parts . as a result of these manipulations , expression ( [ h - e-3 ] )",
    "transforms into @xmath68 the limit @xmath60 of the amplitude ( [ h - e-4 ] ) is given by @xmath69 and it coincides with the transition amplitude derived in the so called light - cone approach ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    the light - cone approach is strictly valid at @xmath60 and in this limit enables one to solve the problem of electron loss ( ionization ) and excitation exactly .",
    "one should also mention that the case of a strong ion - atom interaction this exact solution does not coincide with the first born results , no matter how high is the impact energy @xcite . taking the above two points into account we can make the following conclusions .",
    "first , in the high - energy limit the se model yields an exact solution for the transition amplitude of the projectile - electron excitation and loss .",
    "second , even at @xmath60 the results of the se model still in general differ from those of the first born approximation .",
    "it is rather obvious that such conclusions would also hold if the electron transitions in the ion are caused by the collision with a charged particle ( e.g. a stripped atomic nucleus ) and , for instance , can be applied to @xmath70-shell ionization of atoms by high - energy bare nuclei . in this respect",
    "one should note that in the literature on relativistic ion - atom collisions there had been already attempts to consider the high - energy limit of distorted - wave models for the case of atomic ionization or excitation by the impact of a nucleus , where these processes are treated as a three - body coulomb problem ( the incident and atomic nuclei and atomic electron ) .",
    "in particular , starting with the work of @xcite-@xcite , it had been assumed that the high - energy limit of such distorted - wave models for ionization and excitation processes , like the continuum - distorted - wave - eikonal - initial - state ( cdw - eis ) ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and the se , is simply that of the first born approximation .",
    "we have just seen , however , that for the se model this is not true and that in the high - energy limit the transition amplitude , obtained in this model , goes over into the amplitude derived in the light - cone approach . since at @xmath71",
    "the cdw - eis model becomes essentially identical to the se , the high - energy limit of the cdw - eis coincides with the light - cone approach but differs from the first born approximation .",
    "using the explicit form ( [ e7 ] ) of the scalar potential we obtain that @xmath72 where where @xmath73 is the modified bessel function @xcite , @xmath74 and @xmath75 besides , it also follows from ( [ eic - new-6 ] ) that @xmath76    taking eqs.([eic - new-6 ] ) and ( [ eic - new-8 ] ) into account the transition amplitude becomes @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the modified bessel function @xcite .",
    "the results obtained above , can also be applied for treating ionization and excitation of neutral atoms in relativistic collisions with bare nuclei .",
    "this can be done by setting in ( [ eic - new-9 ] ) @xmath79 , replacing there @xmath80 by @xmath81 , where @xmath81 is the charge of the nucleus incident on the atom , and regarding now @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the initial and final states of the active electron of the atom . keeping in mind that @xmath82 , taking into account that @xmath83 for @xmath84 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath85 is euler s constant , and disregarding an inessential phase - factor we obtain    @xmath86",
    "the se model is normally regarded as a tool for describing collision - induced transitions between bound states . in our case",
    "it would mean that this model should be first of all applied for treating the projectile - electron excitation .",
    "it is known @xcite that at comparatively low relativistic impact energies the model has a problem with describing transitions involving electron spin flip . however , this problem diminishes when the energy increases and practically disappears at energies @xmath16 gev / u .",
    "the se model can also be used for considering the projectile - electron loss ( in particular , the total cross section ) . in such a case",
    "the model also becomes more accurate when the impact energy increases .",
    "in particular , provided in the rest frame of the atom the magnitude of the velocity of the electron , emitted by the projectile , is of the order of the collision velocity , the se model can be applied for calculating not only the total but also differential loss cross sections . in practical terms",
    "this condition holds starting already with @xmath87@xmath88 , i.e. at impact energies @xmath1@xmath13 gev / u .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , at asymptotically high impact energies the se model yields an exact solution . in the case of the projectile - electron excitation and loss in collisions with neutral atoms even for the most highly charged projectiles the region of such energies",
    "is actually reached already at @xmath89@xmath90 .",
    "thus , the model should work excellently starting with the magnitude of @xmath38 of a few tens .    taking all this into account",
    "one can expect that the se model performs quite well at impact energies @xmath1@xmath2 gev / u , which are of special interest for the present study .",
    "below the projectile - electron excitation and loss will be considered in this energy range for collisions between hydrogen- and helium - like highly charged ions and heavy atoms by using the se model .",
    "results of this model will also be compared with those of the first born approximation .",

    "considered our eikonal and first order results differ by @xmath91-@xmath92 .",
    "as expected , when the impact energy increases the difference between them decreases . on overall ,",
    "the difference is not large but nevertheless should be taken into account if precise cross section values are needed .    both the first born and eikonal cross sections agree neither with the experimental data of @xcite nor with that of @xcite .",
    "the data from @xcite are substantially smaller ( by about of @xmath93@xmath94 ) while the data reported in @xcite are considerably larger ( by about a factor of @xmath95@xmath96 ) than our results @xcite .    as was already mentioned in the introduction , there is a difference by roughly a factor of @xmath13 between experimental cross sections reported for for the loss from @xmath7 gev / u pb@xmath12 ions in collisions with solid and gas targets with the solid state cross sections being larger .",
    "the origin of this difference , which was explained in @xcite , lies in multiple collisions between the projectile and atoms inside solids which effectively enhance the electron loss process .",
    "since the magnitude of this difference depends on the impact energy and decreases when the energy decreases , similar reasons are probably responsible for the observed disagreement between our results for atomic targets and the experimental data from @xcite .",
    "if a projectile - ion initially carries several electrons , then more than one electron of the ion can be simultaneously excited and/or lost in a single collision with a neutral atom .",
    "helium - like ions are simplest projectiles , for which simultaneous transitions of more than one electron are possible , and below we consider double electron loss and loss - excitation for the case of such projectiles .    it is known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that , provided the condition @xmath97 is fulfilled , two - electron transitions in a heavy helium - like ion occurring in collisions with an atom are governed practically solely by the independent interactions between the atom and each of the electrons of the ion . in order to describe such transitions one can apply the independent electron model . according to this model the cross section for the double electron loss from a helium - like ion",

    "we see that the difference between the first born and eikonal cross sections turns out to be somewhat smaller for transitions involving the states with @xmath118 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that , compared to the @xmath117 case , these transitions are characterized by larger impact parameters . as a result ,",
    "the field of the atom acting on the electrons of the ion is weaker and , therefore , the first born treatment becomes less inaccurate .",
    "as additional calculations show , the differences between the results of the eikonal and first born calculation does not substantially change when the impact energy increases further . thus , like for the double electron loss , even at asymptotically high impact energies the first born calculation may considerably overestimate the cross section for the simultaneous projectile - electron excitation and loss .    according to both the first born and eikonal results the cross sections for the simultaneous loss - excitation are larger for transitions to the states with @xmath117 .",

    "the origin of this interesting peculiarity can be understood by considering the single - electron transition probabilities .",
