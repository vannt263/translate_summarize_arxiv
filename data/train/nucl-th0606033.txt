    "the elliptic flow is one of the most important observables in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , which carries a lot of information about the initial state of the dense matter @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow @xmath0 for a hadron is defined as the coefficient of the term @xmath1 in the fourier expansion of the invariant differential cross section @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the azimuthal angle of the hadron momentum in the transverse plane @xcite .",
    "the e877 collaboration first measured the anisotropic flow in heavy ion collisions at ags energies . in recent years",
    ", a thorough experimental study of elliptic flows for various hadrons has been taken at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies .",
    "the elliptic flows as functions of centrality , pseudorapidity and transverse momentum have been measured .",
    "various theoretical models have been proposed to describe data , such as coalescence or recombination models @xcite , transport models @xcite , and hydrodynamic models @xcite etc ..    a salient feature of @xmath4 at mediate transverse momenta @xmath5 is the quark number scaling , i.e. when both @xmath0 and @xmath5 rescaled by the constituent quark number @xmath6 of the hadron , the elliptic flow is a universal function of @xmath5 for all hadrons .",
    "the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow and the abnormal ratio of baryons to mesons at mediate @xmath5 support the quark recombination mechanism in hadron formation .",
    "however , at small transverse momenta @xmath5 the quark number scaling is not obvious , instead , there is a different structure the so - called mass hierarchy @xcite in data . in hydrodynamic models ,",
    "the mass hierarchy arises from radial flows which are hadron masses @xcite dependent .",
    "but hydrodynamic models can not describe elliptic flow data at mediate and high @xmath5 .",
    "the mass hierarchy structure of @xmath4 for charged pions and kaons and protons / anti - protons has been reproduced by a multi - phase transport model @xcite . in the large @xmath5 range of about 10 gev / c , ref . @xcite",
    "have described the global behavior of @xmath4 for some hadrons in combination mechanism , but the mass hierarchy of @xmath4 for various hadrons at low @xmath5 has not been fully compared with experiment data or reproduced within coalescence / recombination models .",
    "@xcite and some models have given several possible origins of the mass hierarchy , however , we show decay is one of the most important reasons and give another explanation for the mass hierarchy . in this paper , we carry out a detail study of elliptic flows in a quark combination model in the whole @xmath5 range with a special focus on the mass hierarchy or fine structure at low @xmath5 .",
    "we will show that the fine structure of elliptic flows can be well described in the quark combination picture provided initially produced hadrons and resonance decays are treated separately and properly .",
    "all kinds of hadronization models demand themselves , consciously or not , satisfy rapidity or momentum correlation for quarks in the neighborhood of phase space .",
    "the essence of this correlation is its agreement with the fundamental requirement of qcd which uniquely determines the quark combination rule @xcite . according to qcd",
    ", a @xmath7 may be in a color octet or a singlet which means a repulsive or an attractive interaction between them .",
    "the smaller the difference in rapidity for two quarks is , the longer the interaction time is .",
    "so there is enough time for a @xmath7 to be in a color singlet and form a meson .",
    "similarly , a @xmath8 can be in a sextet or an anti - triplet .",
    "if its nearest neighbor is a @xmath9 in rapidity , they form a baryon . if the neighbor is a @xmath10 ,",
    "because the attraction strength of the singlet is two times that of the anti - triplet , @xmath7 will win the competition to form a meson and leave a @xmath9 alone .",
    "we have developed a variant of the quark combination model ( qcm ) based on a simple quark combination rule @xcite incorporating the above qcd requirements .",
    "the flavor su(3 ) symmetry with strangeness suppression in the yields of initially produced hadrons is fulfilled in our qcm @xcite . using our qcm ,",
    "we have described most of multiplicity data for hadrons in electron - positron and proton - proton / anti - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "also we solved a difficulty facing other qcms in describing the tasso data for baryon - antibaryon correlation in electron - positron collisions : they can be successfully explained by our qcm @xcite .",
    "our qcm can also combine with the color flow picture @xcite to describe the hadroniztion of multiparton states @xcite .",
    "we have extended our qcm to reproduce the recent rhic data for hadron multiplicities and @xmath5 spectra @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a detail analysis of @xmath4 in the whole @xmath5 range based on our qcm .",
    "we put particular emphasis on the low @xmath5 region where the elliptic flow data for various hadrons show non - trivial fine structure .",
    "our treatment of elliptic flows is different from other coalescence or recombination models @xcite .",
    "we extract @xmath11 for quarks as input from fitting the experiment data of various hadrons .",
    "so we can construct elliptic flows for all initially produced hadrons from @xmath11 for quarks in our qcm .",
    "then we let all resonances decay by using the decay program of the event generator pythia @xcite to obtain elliptic flows for final state hadrons .",
    "one advantage of using pythia to deal with decays is that all available decay channels are covered .",
    "here we only take into account light quarks in hadronization . in central au - au collisions at 200 agev ,",
    "the yield of charm hadrons is about 28 in the whole rapidity range @xcite .",
    "so charm quarks are negligible compared to light quarks in @xmath4 for final state hadrons .",
    "in order to describe data of elliptic flows , only those quarks with collinear momenta are allowed to combine into hadrons , because the combination of constituent quarks in different momentum directions would lead to large invariant masses which are off - mass - shell for most hadrons . to describe data in central rapidity , we choose the rapidity range @xmath12 $ ] for hadrons in our calculation .",
    "we also assume that quarks and antiquarks of a same flavor have the the same @xmath11 . considering that the coalescence or recombination models work very well at mediate @xmath5 , we focus our study on elliptic flows at low @xmath5 which have not been well investigated in combination - like models .",
    "we assume three collinear combination strategies , the naive scheme with equal @xmath5 combination and the same @xmath11 for quarks of all flavors , the modified naive scheme with equal @xmath5 combination and a different @xmath11 for strange quarks from light quarks , and the scheme with different @xmath5 combination .      in this scheme , all @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks",
    "are assumed to have the same @xmath16 spectrum .",

    "@xcite by fitting the proton data .",
    "hereafter the unit of @xmath5 is gev .",
    "we make two improvements , one is that the decay contributions have been subtracted , the other is that the negative part of @xmath18 inconsistent to data and to the expected quadratic behavior @xcite at small @xmath5 ( see the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ) is corrected to be positive .",

    "the difference resulted from the two function forms at low @xmath5 range can be neglected for the coefficient of @xmath20 or @xmath21 is adjustable .",
    "one sees that the data for antiprotons are well reproduced at small @xmath5 with the above input , see the solid line in fig .",

    "@xcite , the data for @xmath24 and @xmath25 are from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the data for kaons are from ref . @xcite .    in the naive combination scheme , directly produced mesons and baryons have the same elliptic flows @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , regardless of their masses and species . comparing the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ cap : fig2 ] , one observes that the @xmath4 curve for the hadron @xmath28 shifts somewhere in the left depending on how much the decay contributions the hadron has .",
    "one sees that the fine structure of @xmath4 for hadrons at small @xmath5 results from decay contributions .",
    "but for pions it is not enough to reproduce the data by only including the decays , one has to take into account other effects .",
    "we will address this issue in the modified naive combination scheme in the next subsection .      in this scheme , we take into account that @xmath11 for strange quarks is different from light quarks .",
    "the difference is mainly at small @xmath5 since the quark mass effects barely influence the magnitude of @xmath4 at mediate @xmath5 , see the attached figure in the upper - left corner in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ cap : fig3 ] .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite also include the strange - light difference .",
    "we know that the strongly coupled quark - gluon - plasma produced at rhic is relativistic fluid , then we can assume that the average transverse momenta for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks are proportional to their average energies , @xmath29 .",
    "based on this relation , we modify @xmath11 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks as , @xmath30,\\;\\;\\ ; p_{t}/\\alpha_{i}>0.365.\\label{eq : v2qi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where the average values of quark energies can be approximated as @xmath34 with constituent quark mass @xmath35 for the flavor @xmath36 ( @xmath37 gev , @xmath38 gev ) and with @xmath39 given by the distribution @xmath40 from ref .",
    "here we have implied the central rapidity @xmath41 in estimating the average energy .",
    "based on the input for quark elliptic flows in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v2qi ] ) , @xmath4 for meson and baryon are written as @xmath42 with @xmath43 denote the constituent quarks in the meson @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote those in the baryon @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the @xmath4 curves for hadrons with the same flavor content are identical .",
    "the results in this combination scheme are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig3 ] .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "[ cap : fig2 ] , the @xmath4 curves for directly produced hadrons split according to their flavor contents and lead to even larger splittings for final state hadrons .",
    "the pion curve is partially improved but not enough to match the data . for other hadrons ,",
    "the agreement between theoretical predictions and data is satisfactory .",
    "although tuning @xmath47 to a smaller value would make pion curve fit the data , the fine structure of @xmath4 for other hadrons prevent them from splitting too much .",
    "the results show that in the quark combination mechanism the quark mass effect and resonance decays partially account for the fine structure of @xmath4 for final state hadrons .",
    "in contrast to the hydro - model interpretation of differences among hadron @xmath4 as hadron mass effects , the mass effects at the quark level is partially responsible for such differences in the quark combination picture . to identify the mass effects of strange quarks and light quarks",
    ", a better way is to measure and compare @xmath4 for @xmath3 and @xmath48 in experiments .      as shown in fig . [",
    "cap : fig3 ] , it is still not enough to reproduce the pion data by including resonance decays and the quark mass effect . in order to better fit the pion data together with all other hadrons , we relax in this scheme the constraint that quarks with equal @xmath5 combine into hadrons by allowing unequal @xmath5 combination .",
    "the unequal @xmath5 combination is more general than the equal one which can be regarded as a special case of the former . since the combination condition is changed , we then start with a different form of @xmath11 for quarks from that in the equal @xmath5 combination schemes , @xmath49,\\;\\;\\ ; p_{t}>0.525.\\label{eq : v2q - non}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the results for hadron @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the initial hadrons with the same flavor contents have an identical curve .",
    "one sees in the upper panel that the pion curve agrees with data very well .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite reproduces the pion data after taking into account the momentum distribution of hadrons , a similar strategy to ours , and ref .",
    "@xcite takes into account the resonance decay contribution to pions .",
    "in contrast , we give the results for other hadrons also fit the data besides pions .",
    "the main difference from the equal @xmath5 combination scheme is that @xmath4 spectra for hadrons at mediate @xmath5 split into two groups ( of mesons and baryons ) , i.e. there is no exact quark number scaling , but theoretical predictions are still within the error bars .",
    "more precise measurements are needed to distinguish the two combination schemes in the mediate @xmath5 range .",
    "obviously the fine structure of @xmath4 at low @xmath5 is a joint effect of resonance decays , the quark mass difference in @xmath11 and unequal @xmath5 combination .",
    "the reason that the unequal @xmath5 combination works well at low and mediate @xmath5 lies in the fact that it splits the spectra for different hadrons at the cost of slightly spoiling the quark number scaling .",
    "but the data are not sensitive to such a violation of the scaling .    in fig .",
    "[ cap : fig5 ] , we give the predictions for @xmath3 mesons in three combination schemes .",
    "the agreement with recent star data is satisfactory @xcite . in all of our calculations",
    ", we neglect the influence of hadron re - scattering on @xmath4 , same as in ref . @xcite .",
    "we use quark combination model to study elliptic flows for directly produced hadrons before resonant decays and the final state hadrons .",
    "especially we have investigated the fine structure of elliptic flows at small @xmath5 .",
    "we find the combination mechanism works very well in describing elliptic flow data in low @xmath5 as well as in mediate @xmath5 regime . in the scheme with equal @xmath5 combination and equal input function for @xmath11 for light and strange quarks , the data for all hadrons can be well reproduced except pions , where the fine structure can be understood by the decay contributions .",
    "taking into account the mass effect of the input function @xmath11 for light and strange quarks and assuming unequal @xmath5 combination , the overall agreement between our predictions and all available data for hadrons including pions are satisfactory .",
    "the decay contributions and the mass effect of the input function @xmath11 for quarks play important roles .",
