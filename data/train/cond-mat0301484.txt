    "the form of the interaction potential @xmath18 with @xmath19 has been subject to speculation .",

    ".    normally , the interaction forces or potentials between particles governing each other s motion , are not directly measurable .",
    "the great success of scattering theory was to determine interaction potentials from statistical distributions of particles scattered at some `` target '' composed of the material under investigation @xcite .",
    "learning about human interactions requires a somewhat different approach from statistical physics , which can be learned from books on random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "this method was successfully applied to the statistical description of the time gaps @xmath22 between the arrival times of buses in some mexican cities @xcite , where the potential @xmath23 was found to be a logarithmic function , i.e. @xmath24 it was speculated that the same potential would approximate the ( time ) headway distribution of highway traffic @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our study will identify the shape of the spatial interaction potential and reveal a different driver behavior in free and congested traffic .",
    "we have recently extended a method developed for classical many - particle systems exposed to a `` thermal bath '' of a given temperature , i.e. to random forces of a certain variance and statistics @xcite .",
    "the resulting velocity and netto distance distributions [ see eqs .",
    "( [ vel ] ) and ( [ headway ] ) ] allow one to draw conclusions about the interaction potential @xmath25 as this determines their shapes .",
    "these distributions have been originally derived assuming a conservation of momentum and energy , i.e. a transformation of potential energy into kinetic energy . however , by investigating a fokker - planck equation equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ ov ] ) , one can show that the same distributions are steady - state solutions for driven many - particle systems with forwardly directed rather than symmetrical potentials @xcite , if the system is large enough and if the average velocity @xmath26 and variance @xmath27 are constant . for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , fluctuations in the system",
    "become negligible , and the total energy is only slightly fluctuating .",
    "the effects of the driving force @xmath31 and the dissipative force @xmath32 balance each other in a statistical sense @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath28 requires linear stability of the system ( [ ov ] ) of coupled differential equations , i.e. @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to exclude the stop - and - go regime between 20 and 40 vehicles per kilometer and lane from our investigation @xcite . in summary , the data analysis must be carried out for ensembles of vehicles in a stationary traffic state with a well - defined velocity variance ( generalized `` temperature '' ) var@xmath34 in a reference frame moving with a constant velocity , the average vehicle velocity @xmath26 .",
    "that is , one has to restrict to small density intervals , otherwise one will mix up systems of different generalized temperatures and different average velocities .",
    "such a careful analysis is presented here for the first time for single vehicle data of the dutch two - lane freeway a9 , which was confirmed by another analysis for czech highway data ( not shown ) .",
    "this has led to new and surprising insights regarding the shape of the interaction potential and its dependence on the traffic state .",
    "we will focus on forwardly directed power - law potentials @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a fit parameter and @xmath0 the netto distance ( clearance ) between two successive cars on a ( ring ) road of length @xmath37 .",
    "similar relations have been suggested in some car - following models @xcite and describe the repulsive tendency of drivers to keep a safe distance to the respective car ahead .",
    "the exponent determines the characteristic dynamic and stationary behavior .",
    "we will now investigate the statistical gas of @xmath38 point - like identical particles on a ring of scaled length @xmath38 interacting via the potential energy @xcite @xmath39 herein , @xmath40 is the vector of scaled particle positions @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the global vehicle density . for convenience , we will use a periodic index , i.e. @xmath43 let this so - called short - ranged power - law dyson s gas ( srdg ) be exposed to a temperature reservoir with boltzmann statistics and generalized temperature @xmath44 the corresponding dimensionless hamiltonian reads @xmath45 with the additional condition @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the scaled velocity of the @xmath4th particle and @xmath48 the scaled average velocity . note that all the quantities used here are dimensionless .",

    "we have separately analyzed eight small density intervals in the free low - density regime @xmath75 veh./km and eight density intervals in the congested traffic regime @xmath76 veh./km .",
    "after determination of the respective values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 from the single vehicle data , we have obtained the fit parameter @xmath79 by a least square method , i.e. minimization of the error function @xmath80 measuring the deviation between the theoretical and empirical clearance distributions .",
    "the predicted gaussian distributions reproduce the empirical velocity distributions very well ( see fig .  [ veldist ] ) , which is also supported by other empirical and numerical studies @xcite .",
    "the best fit of the netto distance distributions is obtained for the integer parameter @xmath81 in congested traffic , which is , for example , compatible with the intelligent driver model ( idm ) and perception - based models @xcite . throughout the free traffic regime",
    ", we find a good agreement with @xmath82 , corresponding to weak interactions @xcite ( see figs .",
    "[ leastsq ] , [ distdist ] ) .",
    "this is not only a strong support of studies questioning a uniform behavior of drivers in all traffic regimes @xcite .",
    "it also offers an interpretation of the mysterious fractional distance - scaling exponent @xmath83 in classical follow - the - leader models @xcite , which interpolate between the driver behavior in the free and congested regimes .",
    "we have found that it is successful to generalize thermal - equilibrium properties of a short - ranged power - law dyson s gas exposed to a heat reservoir with the scaled generalized inverse temperature @xmath77 to steady - state vehicle traffic , where @xmath77 is an increasing function of the traffic density @xmath84 in the regime of congested traffic , this dependency is simply linear : @xmath85 .",
    "the presented results show that the shape of the interaction potential of vehicles can be approximated by formula ( [ pote ] ) with @xmath71 for free traffic and @xmath64 for congested traffic .",
    "the theoretical predictions are further supported by the gaussian distribution of the vehicle velocities in all investigated density regimes .",
    "as it is a hard task to derive analytical relations for the clearance distribution ( including its normalization constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , we could demonstrate the determination of vehicle interaction potentials only for simple functional relations .",
    "future advances with this method will hopefully allow to determine velocity - dependent interaction forces or functions with turning points , which are desireable to reproduce the dynamical behavior in the unstable traffic regime realistically as well @xcite .",
    "determining interaction potentials in freeway traffic does not only contribute to the challenging problem of how to fit time headway or distance distributions of vehicles @xcite .",
    "it also advances the quantitative understanding of human behavior .",
    "normally , it is difficult to identify and measure the relevant behavioral variables , and realistic models contain a large number of parameters . here , progress has been made by powerful methods from statistical physics .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting interaction model is not just a physical model .",
    "the new picture of two different regimes with @xmath81 and @xmath86 points to adaptive driver behavior to congested and free traffic conditions .",
    "the specification of the interaction potential is essential for realistic traffic simulations , which are required for the design of efficient and reliable traffic optimization measures such as intelligent on - ramp controls , driver assistance systems , lane - changing assistants , etc .",
