    "by @xmath0-body problems , we mean problems where we want to find the dynamics of @xmath0 point particles . if the space in which such a problem is defined is a space of zero curvature , then we call any solution to such a problem for which the point particles describe the vertices of a polytope that retains its shape over time ( but not necessarily its size ) a homographic orbit .",
    "+ a rotopulsator , also known as a rotopulsating orbit , is a type of solution to an @xmath0-body problem for spaces of constant curvature @xmath2 that extends the definition of homographic orbits to spaces of constant curvature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ homographic orbits ( and therefore rotopulsators ) can be used to determine the geometry of the universe locally ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper , we will prove the existence of a subclass of rotopulsators that form a natural generalisation of orbits found in @xcite and @xcite . + while this paper mainly builds on results obtained in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , research on @xmath0-body problems for spaces of constant curvature goes back to bolyai @xcite and lobachevsky @xcite , who independently proposed a curved 2-body problem in hyperbolic space @xmath3 in the 1830s . in later years",
    ", @xmath0-body problems for spaces of constant curvature have been studied by mathematicians such as dirichlet , schering @xcite , @xcite , killing @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and liebmann @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recent results were obtained by kozlov , harin @xcite , but the study of @xmath0-body problems in spaces of constant curvature for the case that @xmath4 started with @xcite , @xcite , @xcite by diacu , prez - chavela , santoprete .",
    "further results for the @xmath4 case were then obtained by cariena , raada , santander @xcite , diacu @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , diacu , kordlou @xcite , diacu , prez - chavela @xcite . for a more detailed historical overview ,",
    "please see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we will prove the following two theorems :    [ main theorem1 ] for any rotopulsating solution of ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) formed by vectors @xmath5 as defined in ( [ expression homographic orbits ] ) , the vectors @xmath6 have to form a regular polygon if @xmath7 is non - constant .",
    "[ main theorem2 ] rotopulsating orbits formed by vectors @xmath5 as defined in ( [ expression homographic orbits ] ) exist if the vectors @xmath6 form a regular polygon .",
    "to prove these theorems , we will use a method strongly inspired by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . specifically",
    ", we will first deduce a necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of rotopulsators .",
    "this will be done in section  [ a criterion for the existence of rotopulsators ] .",
    "we will then prove theorem  [ main theorem1 ] and theorem  [ main theorem2 ] in section  [ proof of main theorem 1 ] and section  [ proof of main theorem 2 ] respectively .",
    "in this section , we will formulate a necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of rotopulsating orbits of the type described in ( [ expression homographic orbits ] ) .",
    "+ consider the @xmath0-body problem in spaces of constant curvature @xmath2 .",
    "+ as has been shown in @xcite , we may assume that @xmath8 equals either @xmath9 , or @xmath10 .",
    "+ we will denote the masses of its @xmath0 point particles to be @xmath11 , @xmath12 , ... ,",
    "@xmath13 and their positions by the @xmath14-dimensional vectors @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 furthermore , consider for @xmath18-dimensional vectors @xmath19 , + @xmath20 the inner product @xmath21 then , following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the assumption that @xmath22 from @xcite , we define the equations of motion for the curved @xmath0-body problem as the dynamical system described by @xmath23}{[\\sigma-(\\textbf{q}_{i}\\odot_{k}\\textbf{q}_{j})^{2}]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}-(\\sigma\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_{i}\\odot_{k}\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_{i})\\textbf{q}_{i},\\textrm { } i=\\overline{1,n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let @xmath24 be a @xmath25 rotation matrix , where @xmath26 is some real valued , twice continuously differentiable , scalar function , for which @xmath27 .",

    "+ finally , before formulating our criterion , we need to introduce some notation and a lemma : + let @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the euclidean inner product on @xmath34 and let @xmath35 be the euclidean norm on @xmath34 .",

    "and we will assume that @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the angle between @xmath41 and the first coordinate axis .",
    "the lemma we will need to prove our criterion is :    [ the lemma ] the functions @xmath7 and @xmath42 , are related through the following formula : @xmath43 .    in @xcite , using the wedge product , diacu proved that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant bivector . + if @xmath46 are the standard base vectors in @xmath47 , then we can write @xmath45 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 are constants . as @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , we can rewrite ( [ cwedge1 ] ) as @xmath52 where @xmath53",
    ". + calculating @xmath54 , will give us our result : + note that @xmath55 and @xmath56 using ( [ expression homographic orbits ] ) with ( [ c2l-12l formula 1 ] ) gives @xmath57 note that @xmath58 so , using ( [ properties of t ] ) repeatedly , we get that @xmath59 which means that @xmath60 as , by construction @xmath61 we may divide both sides of ( [ c2l-12l final formula ] ) by @xmath62 which gives that @xmath63 which is constant , so @xmath64 .",
    "we now have the following necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of a rotopulsating orbit , as described in ( [ expression homographic orbits ] ) :    [ criterion ] let @xmath65 then necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a rotopulsating orbit of non - constant size are that @xmath66 and @xmath67 for all @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath69 and consequently @xmath70 inserting ( [ expression homographic orbits ] ) into ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) and using ( [ expression homographic orbits 2 ] ) and ( [ expression homographic orbits 3 ] ) gives for the first and second lines of ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) that @xmath71}{[\\sigma-(\\textbf{q}_{i}\\odot_{k}\\textbf{q}_{j})^{2}]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}-(\\sigma\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_{i}\\odot_{k}\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_{i})\\textbf{q}_{i}\\right )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the @xmath25 identity matrix .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath75 as we have that @xmath76 and as by ( [ expression zodot z 2 ] ) , @xmath77 we may rewrite ( [ expression zodot z 2 ] ) as @xmath78 which can , in turn , be written as @xmath79 furthermore , @xmath80 as @xmath81 is a rotation in @xmath82 , it is a unitary map , meaning that for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , meaning that ( [ qdotqdot 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath86 using ( [ expression homographic orbits 2 ] ) with ( [ qdotqdot 2 ] ) gives @xmath87 inserting ( [ qdotqdot 3 ] ) and ( [ final expression qiqj ] ) into ( [ tothecriterion1 ] ) and multiplying both sides by @xmath88 provides us with @xmath89}{[\\rho^{2}(1-\\cos{(\\beta_{i}-\\beta_{j})})(2-\\sigma\\rho^{2}(1-\\cos{(\\beta_{i}-\\beta_{j})}))]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\\\ & -(\\sigma\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^{2}+\\sigma\\rho^{3}\\dot{\\theta}^{2}+\\sigma\\rho\\dot{z}\\odot_{k-2}\\dot{z})\\textbf{q}_{i}. \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the euclidean inner product with @xmath41 on both sides of ( [ tothecriterion3 ] ) and using that @xmath90 , provides us with @xmath91}{[(2-\\sigma\\rho^{2}(1-\\cos{(\\beta_{i}-\\beta_{j})}))]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the euclidean inner product of ( [ tothecriterion3 ] ) with @xmath92 and using that @xmath90 gives that @xmath93^{\\frac{3}{2}}}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let @xmath94}{[(2-\\sigma\\rho^{2}(1-\\cos{\\alpha_{ij}}))]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\textrm { and } \\\\      & c_{i}:=\\sum\\limits_{j=1 , j\\neq i}^{n}\\frac{-m_{j}\\sin{(\\beta_{i}-\\beta_{j})}}{[(1-\\cos{(\\beta_{i}-\\beta_{j})})(2-\\sigma\\rho^{2}(1-\\cos{(\\beta_{i}-\\beta_{j})}))]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting ( [ qdotqdot 3 ] ) and ( [ final expression qiqj ] ) into ( [ expression zodot z 1 ] ) , combined with ( [ tothecriterion3b ] ) and ( [ sin ] ) gives the following system of differential equations : @xmath95 for ( [ system of differential equations ] ) to make sense , we need that @xmath96 which shows the necessity of ( [ conditions ] ) . + furthermore , that ( [ system of differential equations ] ) has a global solution holds by the same argument as the argument used in the proof of criterion 1 in @xcite to prove global existence of a solution of ( 15 ) and ( 17 ) . by the uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations given suitable initial conditions , the solution to ( [ system of differential equations ] ) must be a rotopulsating orbit , as every step from ( [ tothecriterion1 ] ) and ( [ expression zodot z 1 ] ) to ( [ system of differential equations ] ) is invertible .",
    "+ thus ( [ conditions ] ) is both necessary and sufficient . finally , as by lemma  [ the lemma ] + @xmath64",
    ", we have that @xmath97 , which means that the left hand side of ( [ sin ] ) equals zero , which means that @xmath98 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "in criterion  [ criterion ] , let @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "then the conditions of criterion  [ criterion ] become exactly the conditions of criterion  1 in @xcite with the added bonus that @xmath103 .",
    "the proof of theorem  1.1 in @xcite is therefore a proof for theorem  [ main theorem1 ] as well .",
    "let again @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 in criterion  [ criterion ] .",
    "then the conditions of criterion  [ criterion ] become exactly the conditions of criterion  1 in @xcite with the added bonus that @xmath103 .",
