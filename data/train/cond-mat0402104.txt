    "the physics of vibro - fluidized granular materials is far from being fully understood . in particular , the applicability of hydrodynamics @xcite is still an object of debate @xcite . despite the similarities to the hydrodynamics of elastic hard - sphere systems , concerning e.g.  the appearance of instabilities @xcite , a main difference to ordinary fluids",
    "is the fact that continuous energy injection is vital to maintain a stationary state .",
    "otherwise a gas of inelastic spheres would collapse , even in the absence of gravity .",
    "the non - trivial nature of this stationary state has been elucidated in experiments of vibrating grains . among the most striking features found",
    "are non - gaussian velocity distributions @xcite and cluster formation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several attempts have been made to extract either an equation of state or more generally a scaling relation for the thermodynamic variables @xcite .",
    "the specification of the driving mechanism is a crucial ingredient for any model describing vibrated granular fluids . a rather simple approach , though less appealing from an experimental point of view , utilizes stochastic bulk heating by uncorrelated random forces , which act on every particle at every instant of time @xcite . in @xcite",
    "random restitution coefficients were considered with a probability distribution allowing for values both smaller and greater than one . however , this yields non - universal properties depending on the specific form of this distribution .",
    "the multiplicative bulk driving defined in terms of stochastic collision rules in @xcite is similar in spirit .",
    "as compared to bulk driving , a driving mechanism which acts only at a boundary of the system is much closer to experiments . in @xcite",
    "the energy influx at the boundary has been modeled by a heuristically motivated ansatz for the heat current , while @xcite assume heating at the boundary through thermal walls . in the present paper",
    "the driving mechanism consists in incrementing a particle s velocity by a constant amount after every collision with a wall .",
    "this way of driving was used before in e.g.  @xcite , and with slight modifications in @xcite .",
    "one theoretical approach to study granular systems at fluid densities rests on kinetic theory , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "particular applications to driven granular gases can be found in @xcite .",
    "much of this work has been based on the boltzmann equation , modified for inelastic collisions .",
    "one method to solve this nonlinear equation is based on the local equilibrium distribution @xcite , which is only known for the elastic case . for systems with strongly inelastic collisions ,",
    "the stationary state is unknown so that a systematic discussion of transport properties within kinetic theory is severely hampered .",
    "hydrodynamic studies @xcite have been motivated partly by the search for an understanding of temperature and density profiles @xcite , but also by experiments on hydrodynamic - like instabilities @xcite . in the hydrodynamic approach",
    "the question arises , how to relate the pressure to the density and temperature .",
    "several equations of state for the global quantities have been proposed , either interpolating between the high and low density limit @xcite or invoking the boltzmann equation @xcite for inelastically colliding particles .",
    "it is not clear , whether an equation of state also holds for the local hydrodynamic fields in a strongly driven , non - equilibrium system , where the fields are strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "most simulations of vibrated granular gases have been based either on event - driven molecular dynamics @xcite or the direct - simulation monte carlo method @xcite . if the system is driven through the boundaries , inhomogeneous density and temperature profiles are measured . for low densities",
    "the computed temperature profiles agree well with hydrodynamic theory @xcite , whereas for moderate or high densities the profiles are not well understood with the exception of almost elastically colliding particles .",
    "the full stress tensor , including potential contributions , has only been computed for freely cooling systems @xcite . in simulations of driven granular gases @xcite the collisional part of the stress tensor has not been measured , and in @xcite the stress tensor is not measured directly but instead computed from a local equation of state .    inspired by experiment @xcite ,",
    "a lot of emphasis has been put on the tails of the velocity distribution functions , which were found to be overpopulated as compared to a maxwellian . in fact , all intermediate types of decay between a gaussian and an exponential were observed @xcite . in addition mixtures @xcite and rough spheres @xcite have been investigated as well as hydrodynamic instabilities such as convection @xcite and pattern formation @xcite .    in this paper , we present results from event - driven simulations of inelastic spheres in two dimensions confined between two vibrating walls without gravity .",
    "our focus is on the stationary state , which is reached when dissipation by particle collision equals energy injection due to the vibrating walls . in the stationary state ,",
    "density and temperature profiles are shown to be strongly inhomogeneous due to the driving walls  even in a range of parameters , where clustering is only a minor effect .",
    "this has led us to    \\(a ) derive a constitutive equation by relating the measured hydrodynamic fields , granular temperature @xmath2 , volume fraction @xmath3 and pressure @xmath4 , at each point @xmath0 and    \\(b ) check whether this constitutive equation is universal or depends on the global system parameters of the model , like the aspect ratio of the cell , the overall volume fraction or the coefficient of restitution of the disks . for moderately inelastic systems ( @xmath5 )",
    "the constitutive equation is ( almost ) independent of the remaining global system parameters so that the constitutive equation can be interpreted as a local equation of state for the a driven granular gas in the stationary state , even though the latter is highly inhomogeneous with heterogeneous temperature and density profiles .",
    "in contrast , for strongly inelastic systems ( @xmath6 ) the constitutive equation depends significantly on the global system parameters so that the concept of a local equation of state can not be sustained in this case .",
    "we furthermore discuss the one - particle distribution function in the stationary state and show that    \\(c ) the local distribution @xmath7 of @xmath8 , the velocity in the direction of driving , is not a function of the rescaled variable @xmath9 alone .",
    "similarly , curves of @xmath10 can not be mapped onto a master curve for different @xmath0 , when plotted against @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the local granular temperature associated with the translational motion in the @xmath13-direction .",
    "we find deviations from scaling at small and large arguments .",
    "\\(d ) the local velocity distributions @xmath14 and @xmath15 have high - velocity tails whose decay ranges from stretched exponential to almost gaussian .",
    "the particular type of decay depends on the position in the sample , the overall particle density and the coefficient of restitution .",
    "furthermore , the decay of @xmath14 for large velocities is generally different from that of @xmath15 .    taken together , one has to acknowledge that the stationary state of a driven granular gas is by no means universal .",
    "it shows peculiar features that depend on the precise values of the system parameters in contrast to the corresponding elastic system .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "we investigate a driven granular gas in 2 dimensions consisting of @xmath16 identical inelastic smooth hard disks of diameter @xmath17 and mass @xmath18 which are confined to a rectangular box with edges of length @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the gas is driven through the walls perpendicular to the @xmath0-direction , which vibrate in an idealized saw - tooth manner ( see below ) , while periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "[ fig : schnappschuss ] shows a typical snapshot .",
    "the gas evolves in time through ballistic center - of - mass motion , binary inelastic collisions and particle - wall collisions .",
    "the inelastic nature of inter - particle collisions is the most important characteristic of granular media .",
    "as is often done we assume that it can be taken into account by a constant coefficient of normal restitution and briefly recall the collision rules for binary collisions , see e.g. @xcite .    the unit - vector from the center of sphere two to the center of sphere one is denoted by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the position vector of the center of mass of particle @xmath13 .",
    "the center - of - mass velocities before a collision are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the relative velocity by @xmath25 .",
    "post - collisional quantities are primed . the relative velocity after a collision",
    "is assumed to obey @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] is the ( constant ) coefficient of normal restitution .",
    "the value @xmath28 describes elastic collisions with energy conservation , while for @xmath29 energy will not be conserved but decreased in each collision .",
    "the constitutive equation ( [ eq : rauku4 ] ) plus momentum conservation determines the post - collisional velocities for the disks @xmath30 where @xmath31 the model could easily be extended to rough spheres by also specifying the disks moment of inertia as well as a coefficient of tangential restitution @xmath32 and coulomb friction @xmath33 @xcite , but here we restrict ourselves to smooth spheres so that rotational motion is decoupled from translational motion .",
    "when a particle collides with a driving wall , energy is injected into the system .",
    "this can be modeled in different ways , for example by drawing a new velocity from a maxwellian distribution of a given wall temperature @xcite or by assuming that the wall has a coefficient of normal restitution that is greater than one .",
    "both of these mechanisms have no close experimental equivalents , though .",
    "a more realistic model is to assume a vibrating wall moving either in a symmetric ( e.g. sinusoidal ) or in an asymmetric ( e.g. saw - tooth ) way .",
    "in addition , this can be combined with a normal ( and also tangential ) coefficient of restitution @xcite . in this article",
    "we refrain from the latter and restrict ourselves to saw - tooth driving of the walls in the limit of vanishing amplitudes @xmath34 and diverging frequency @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "this ensures that the driving walls are always located at the same positions and leads to the following simple expression for a particle s change of velocity due to a collision with the left / right wall @xmath37 and @xmath38 stands for the unit vector in @xmath0-direction .",
    "following e.g. @xcite we performed event - driven simulations in two dimensions with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1-direction and two identical idealized vibrating elastic walls in the @xmath0-direction .",
    "we initialize the system by placing the disks on a triangular lattice with a gaussian velocity distribution . to let the correlations of the initial state relax , the system is evolved elastically with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1-direction and elastic non - vibrating walls in the @xmath0-direction for an average of 100 collisions per particle",
    ". then we switch on the driving of the left and right wall and the dissipation for particle - particle - collisions .",
    "before we start measuring the observables we let the system relax further until , at time @xmath39 , it has reached a stationary state , as indicated by the total kinetic energy , which fluctuates around a time - independent mean value .    to measure hydrodynamic fields in the stationary state we subdivide our box into cells @xmath40 of area @xmath41 , centered at position @xmath42",
    "we then count the number of particles latexmath:[$f(\\bm{r } , v_x , v_y , t )    @xmath40 with an @xmath0-component of the velocity between @xmath8 and @xmath44 and @xmath1-component of the velocity between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "such a local observable fluctuates as a function of time . to eliminate these fluctuations we average over a ( long ) time interval of length @xmath47 and compute @xmath48 of particular interest",
    "is the particle density @xmath49 or the area fraction @xmath50 and the two components @xmath51 of the granular temperature @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the velocity field .",
    "the total granular temperature in 2 dimensions is defined as @xmath54 .",
    "the stress tensor at position @xmath55 and time @xmath56 has a kinetic contribution and one that is due to the interactions between the particles @xmath57 .",

    "here @xmath61 is the @xmath13-th component of the vector of length @xmath62 pointing from the center of disk @xmath59 to its collision contact point , and @xmath63 is the @xmath64-th component of the momentum change of particle @xmath59 during this collision . to compute the collisional part of the stress tensor",

    "similar to the other hydrodynamic fields , in a second step @xmath71 is averaged over time in order to get the collisional part of the stress tensor in the stationary state @xmath72 the corresponding local pressure @xmath73 is defined as usual as the negative trace of the stress tensor divided by the space dimension .    besides hydrodynamic fields we have also measured velocity distributions in sec .  [ sec : vel.distr . ] .",

    "coarse - grained measurements in space and time of certain observables may depend on the coarse - graining resolution .",
    "for example , this was demonstrated for the stress tensor in shear - flow driven granular systems in @xcite .",
    "our measurements of observables in the stationary state , however , should not suffer from such effects for two reasons : first , we could not detect any significant non - zero local velocity field in the simulated systems and , second , because of the long - time average needed to obtain stationary - state quantities .",
    "moreover , in the simulations we have never found any significant dependence of the ( long - time - averaged ) hydrodynamic fields on @xmath1 , the coordinate parallel to the driving walls . yet ,",
    "stripe states , which are homogeneous in @xmath1 , but have an enhanced density in the middle of the sample , are known @xcite to exhibit instabilities with respect to density fluctuations in @xmath1 .",
    "a marginal stability analysis @xcite of granular hydrodynamics ( for @xmath75 close to one ) determines the conditions under which such phenomena occur .",
    "as far as a comparison can be made , our systems fall into the stable region .",
    "hence , we choose the cells @xmath40 as stripes along the @xmath1-direction , for which we write @xmath76 , and compute the hydrodynamic fields with spatial resolution in @xmath0-direction only .",
    "thus , we also write @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 and change the notation accordingly for all other quantities . in the simulations",
    "the stripes @xmath76 were all chosen to have equal width @xmath79 , the temporal resolution of our measurements was set to @xmath80 , and the long - time average involves typically @xmath81  @xmath82 collision events .",

    "the model system contains three independent length scales : the diameter @xmath17 of a disk and the box sizes @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , there is one independent velocity scale , the driving velocity @xmath83 , and one independent mass scale , the mass of a disk @xmath18 . together with the initial positions and velocities of the particles that exhausts all dimensional quantities entering the time evolution of the system .",
    "we would like to describe the system using dimensionless variables that do not depend on the initial conditions since we expect stationary states to be independent thereof .",

    "note that there are no other time and energy scales .",
    "thus , we introduce dimensionless variables : box sizes @xmath86 and @xmath87 , granular temperatures @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and the stress tensor @xmath90 . in the stationary state",
    "all dimensionless variables like @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are _ independent of the driving velocity _ and only depend on position @xmath55 and the remaining 4 independent dimensionless system parameters , which characterize the system completely : the number of disks @xmath16 , the two edges of length of the system @xmath93 and @xmath94 in units of @xmath17 , and the coefficient of normal restitution @xmath75 , which is a dimensionless material constant .    for simplicity of the notation",
    "we refrain from indicating dimensionless quantities by a tilde from now on .",
    "this should not cause confusion , because quantities having a physical dimension will not occur any more in the rest of the paper ( except for the appendix ) .",
    "we are interested in the macroscopic limit , which is taken such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 with a fixed line density @xmath97 of particles .",
    "thus , in the macroscopic limit the number of system parameters is further reduced to @xmath19 , @xmath98 , and @xmath75 .",
    "it is important to keep @xmath19 finite , otherwise energy balance would not work : energy input occurs only at boundaries , while energy dissipation is a bulk phenomenon .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the average or global granular temperature @xmath99 by balancing the energy input at the walls and the energy loss due to particle collisions in the bulk @xcite .",
    "as shown in the appendix , we find that the granular temperature in the stationary state is independent of the initial data and given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 stands for the pair correlation at contact of the corresponding elastic system , which we estimate by the henderson approximation ( [ chiapprox ] ) . in fig .",

    "we note that all quantities are symmetric in @xmath0 as expected . except for a small area of approximately one disk diameter next to the walls ( indicated by the vertical lines ) ,",

    "the temperatures @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are monotonic as well with the lowest temperatures in the middle of the sample .",
    "the reason for the increased density next to the wall is an effective attractive potential of the wall due to entropic effects : once a disks gets closer to the wall than one disk diameter , it can only receive hits from within the box but no hits from the direction of the wall .",
    "thus the particle is pushed closer to the wall @xcite .",
    "this effect is partially compensated by the driving walls , which add momentum to any particle hitting the walls .    to support this explanation",
    "we have also investigated systems of half the size @xmath122 , half the number of particles and with an elastic wall at @xmath123 .",
