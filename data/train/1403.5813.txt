    "in recent years , the interest in plastic electronics has grown considerably .",
    "the realization of devices such as organic field - effect transistors ( ofet ) represents a key step in this field .",
    "single - crystal ofet made of ultrapure small molecule semiconductors are characterized by mobilities up to one order of magnitude larger then those typical of thin film transistors @xcite .",
    "the most promising are those based on oligoacenes , such as pentacene and rubrene , which exhibit a strong anysotropy and the largest mobility measured in organic semiconductors @xcite .    in spite of many applications based on such devices ,",
    "the intrinsic transport mechanism acting in high mobility organic semiconductors is not fully understood .",
    "transport measurements from @xmath0 k to room temperature in single crystal semiconductors , such as rubrene , show a behaviour of the charge carrier mobility @xmath1 which can be defined band - like ( @xmath2 , with the exponent @xmath3 close to two ) similar to that observed in crystalline inorganic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "however , the order of magnitude of mobility is much smaller than that of pure inorganic semiconductors , and the mean free path for the carriers has been theoretically estimated to be comparable with the molecular separation at room temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ioffe - regel limit is reached with increasing temperature . moreover , in some systems , starting from room temperature , a crossover from band - like to activated hopping behavior can take place @xcite .",
    "the crossover has been interpreted as due to the formation of the polaron , that is the quasi - particle formed by the electron ( or hole ) and the surrounding phonon cloud @xcite .",
    "for example , in naphthalene and anthracene , while the mobility along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 axis shows only a slightly change with the temperature , that along the @xmath6 axis is characterized by a temperature activated behavior at higher temperature with energy barrier of the order of @xmath7 mev @xcite .",
    "the experimental data in these compounds suggest that the coherent band transport is gradually destroyed and the transport due to polaron hopping evolves as a parallel channel dominating at sufficiently high temperature ( which can be larger than room temperature ) @xcite .",
    "sketch about the interplay between low frequency inter - molecular and high frequency intra - molecular vibrational modes in a crystal of naphtalene .",
    "the charge carrier deforms the benzene ring when it is on the molecule .",
    "moreover , the charge carrier displaces two neighbor molecules when it jumps.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in systems with polarizable gates , scaling laws of the mobility as a function of the dielectric constant of solid @xcite and liquid @xcite gates have been discovered pointing out that the nearby dielectric has a strong influence . actually , if the difference between the dielectric constant of the organic semiconductor and of the gate is small , at temperatures close or higher than @xmath0 k , the mobility @xmath1 of these systems exhibits the power - law band - like behavior .",
    "on the other hand , if the dielectric constant mismatch is high , an activated insulating behavior is found with much smaller values of mobility at room temperature @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of this behavior is that the injected charge carriers undergo a polaronic localization due to the interaction with modes at the interface with the polarizable dielectric gate @xcite .    extended vs. localized features of charge carriers appear also in spectroscopic observations .",
    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) supports the extended character of states @xcite showing that the quasi - particle energy dispersion does exhibit a weak mass renormalization even if the width of the peaks of the spectral function increases significantly with temperature . for pentacene , the bandwidth",
    "is reduced only by about @xmath8 going from @xmath9 to @xmath10 indicating moderate values of electron - phonon coupling . on the other hand , some spectroscopic probes , such as electron spin resonance ( esr ) @xcite , thz @xcite , and modulated spectroscopy @xcite",
    "are in favor of states localized within few molecules . actually , in rubrene and in pentacene , to ascribe the presence of localized features to small polarons is not likely since the electron - phonon coupling is not large enough to justify the polaron formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , one of the main theoretical problems is to conciliate band - like with localized features of charge carriers @xcite .",
    "first - principle calculations have pointed out that charge carriers are affected by the coupling to inter - molecular modes with low frequency in comparison with typical electron hoppings @xcite . a model that is to some extent close to the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh )",
    "@xcite hamiltonian has been recently introduced to take into account this interaction @xcite .",
    "it is a minimal one - dimensional ( 1d ) system , valid for the most conductive crystal axis of high mobility systems , where the effect of the electron - phonon coupling is reduced to a modulation of the transfer integral @xcite .",
    "a dynamic approach where vibrational modes are treated as classical variables has been used in 1d and in a recent generalization to two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite . within this method ,",
    "the temperature dependence of computed mobility is in agreement with experimental results .",
    "however , the role of dimensionality of the system is not clear : in fact , in the 1d case , one has @xmath11 , while , in the 2d case , the decrease of the mobility with temperature is intermediate between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in any case , the computed mobility is larger than that measured ( at least a factor of two ) .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of only one charge particle is studied neglecting completely the role of the chemical potential .",
    "finally , the effects on charge carrier dynamics due to the coupling with vibrational modes are included in an approximate way @xcite and the corresponding coupled dynamics do not recover the right thermal equilibrium on long times .",
    "recently , the transport properties of the 1d ssh model have been analyzed within a different adiabatic approach @xcite mapping the problem onto that of a single quantum particle in a random potential ( generalized anderson problem @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , some of us have made a systematic study of this 1d model including the vertex corrections into the calculation of the mobility @xcite .",
    "while finite frequency quantities are properly calculated in this 1d model , the inclusion of vertex corrections leads to a vanishing mobility unless an ad - hoc broadening of the energy eigenvalues is assumed .",
    "it is clear that 1d adiabatic models suffer of severe limitations , of which the main is that electronic states are always localized @xcite .",
    "moreover , features such as band anisotropy , small but finite carrier density are necessary for a correct description of the systems . therefore , in this review , we first analyze a generic three - dimensional ( 3d ) model such as the anisotropic holstein model @xcite in order to discuss the relevant issue of the band anisotropy at finite carrier density .",
    "this model is studied within the adiabatic approach focusing on the weak to intermediate el - ph coupling regime which is relevant for high mobility organic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "next , we analyze a realistic model for rubrene which represents an extension of the 1d ssh model to the quasi 2d case since this is the relevant geometry for ofet @xcite .",
    "spectral and transport properties calculated within these two models are discussed in this review .",
    "the spectral functions show peaks which are weakly renormalized in comparison with those of the bare bands .",
    "however , with increasing temperature , the width of the spectral functions gets larger and larger making the quasi - particles less defined .",
    "the marked width of the spectral functions gives rise to densities of states with a low energy exponential tail increasing with temperature . at low temperatures",
    ", this tail corresponds to localized states and gives rough indications for the energy position of the mobility edge . with increasing temperature , in the regime of low carrier doping appropriate to most ofet , the chemical potential always enters the energy region of the tail .",
    "the features of the spectral function and the behavior of the chemical potential allow to reconcile the band - like description ( arpes data ) with the finding that charge carriers appear more localized at high temperature ( esr and modulated spectroscopy data ) .",
    "the study of spectral properties also clarifies that the states that mainly contribute to the conduction process have low momentum and are not at the chemical potential .",
    "the mobility @xmath1 is studied as a function of the electron - phonon coupling , the temperature and particle density .",
    "not only the order of magnitude and the anisotropy ratio between different directions are in agreement with experimental observations , but also the temperature dependence of @xmath1 is correctly reproduced in the model for rubrene since it scales as a power law @xmath13 , with @xmath3 close or larger than two . the inclusion of vertex corrections in the calculation of the mobility is relevant , in particular , to get a transport lifetime one order smaller than the spectral lifetime of the states involved in the transport mechanism . moreover , with increasing temperature , the ioffe - regel limit is reached since the contribution of itinerant states to the conduction becomes less and less relevant .",
    "_ ab - initio _ calculations have clarified that charge carriers in organic semiconductors are not only coupled to low frequency inter - molecular modes , but also to intra - molecular modes with high frequency in comparison with typical electron hoppings @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ naphta ] for a sketch in naphtalene crystal ) .",
    "an important point is that the reorganization energy ( related to the polaron binding energy ) decreases with increasing the number of benzene rings in oligoacenes ( for example , going from naphthalene to pentacene ) . in order to fully explore the effects of the different modes on prototype single crystal organic semiconductors , such as oligoacenes , a model with intermediate coupling to both intra- and inter - molecular modes",
    "is analyzed in this review @xcite .",
    "we will show that the interplay between local and non local electron - phonon interactions is able to provide a very accurate description of the mobility and to shed light on the intricate mechanism of band narrowing with increasing temperature @xcite .    when the organic semiconductor is grown on a polarizable gate",
    ", it is important to analyze the effects of electron coupling to surface vibrational modes of the gate at the interface with the semiconductor mediated by a long - range electron - phonon interaction @xcite . in this review ,",
    "we analyze a model which combines the effects of interface and intrinsic bulk electron - phonon couplings on the transport properties at finite temperature .",
    "we show that the coupling to the organic semiconductor bulk phonon modes affects the behavior of mobility below room temperature enhancing the coherent contribution , but it is ineffective on the incoherent small polaron contribution dominated by the interface coupling at high temperatures .    in order to improve the modeling of organic semiconductors , the effect of a weak disorder due to bulk and interface traps is included @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the interplay between long - range electron - phonon interactions and disorder effects is investigated within a model .",
    "the disorder effects are able to enhance the hopping barriers of the activated mobility and to drive the small polaron formation to lower values of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "we point out that disorder is a key factor to get agreement with experimental data in rubrene ofet grown on polarizable gate dielectrics , such as the @xmath14 oxide @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii , the effects of electron coupling to low frequency vibrational modes on the spectral and transport properties are discussed in high - dimensional holstein - like and ssh - like models . in section iii , the effects of electron coupling to both low frequency inter - molecular and high frequency intra - molecular modes on the spectral and transport properties are investigated . in section iv , the influence of gates made of polarizable dielectrics and the interplay between electron - phonon couplings and disorder strength on the transport properties are emphasized . in section",
    "v , conclusions and final discussions .",
    "the anisotropy of the electronic properties is a key ingredient in the description of organic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore , in subsection @xmath15 , we will introduce a simple anisotropic tight - binding model including a holstein - like electron coupling to low frequency modes in order to focus on the effects of electronic structure .",
    "however , the results will be discussed later in subsection @xmath16 in comparison with those obtained by a more detailed model based on inter - molecular low frequency modes that will be introduced in subsection @xmath17 .",
    "we assume the following model hamiltonian : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bare electron hopping toward the nearest neighbors @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the charge carrier creation and annihilation operators , respectively , relative to the site @xmath23 ( of a cubic lattice with parameter @xmath4 for the holstein model and of an orthorombic lattice with constants @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 for the rubrene model of the next section ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the oscillator displacement and momentum , respectively , @xmath26 the oscillator mass , and @xmath27 the elastic constant . in eq.([h ] ) , @xmath28 represents the electron - phonon coupling term .",
    "a simple model able to capture the anisotropy of the electronic properties of these materials is the anisotropic holstein hamiltonian which is generic for high mobility organic semiconductors such as oligoacenes @xcite .",

    "we consider a realistic quasi-2d model which simulates the properties of rubrene @xcite .",

    "for the organic semiconductors studied in this paper , the adiabatic ratio is very low implying that the adiabatic limit is appropriate for studying low - frequency intermolecular modes .",
    "consequently , it is possible to adopt a semiclassical approach : the electron dynamics is fully quantum , while the ion dynamics is assumed classical .",
    "this assumption will limit the temperature range where the results can be considered valid , indeed all the results are valid for temperatures @xmath67 .",

    "moreover , with increasing temperature , the peak position of the spectral function is only poorly renormalized in comparison with the bare one , in agreement with results of 1d ssh model @xcite . therefore , these states keep the itinerant character of the bare ones , and they will be involved into the diffusive conduction process ( see discussion in the next paragraph ) .",
    "we notice that the spectral function at @xmath87 is extremely small at the chemical potential @xmath79 for all the temperatures .",
    "for example , at @xmath91 k , the spectral weight is concentrated in an energy region higher than that in which the chemical potential is located ( @xmath92 for @xmath89 ) . actually , the spectral weight is mainly in the region between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "this region corresponds to localized states @xcite .",
    "we have , indeed , checked analyzing the wave functions extracted from exact diagonalizations that , actually , states with energies deep in the tail are strongly localized ( one or two lattice parameters along the different directions as localization length ) . on the other hand , close to the shoulder ( @xmath98 , see fig . [ fig2 ] ) , the itinerant nature of states is clearly obtained .",
    "this analysis allows to give an estimation for the mobility edge energy ( the energy that divides localized and itinerant states ) which can be located very close to the band edge @xmath95 for free electrons ( in our case , @xmath99 ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we first discuss the mobility of the anisotropic holstein model along @xmath107 direction as a function of temperature with changing the particle density . within this model , the carrier density strongly affects the behavior of mobility showing a cross - over from metallic to insulating behavior at low temperatures . for densities around one per cent",
    ", the chemical potential at low temperature is above the mobility edge and , then , the mobility is metallic - like . on the other hand",
    "the situation is different for densities below one per cent . at those densities",
    ", the chemical potential is below the mobility edge , so that mobility shows an insulating character .",
    "translated in a polaronic framework , this would mean that the single particle sees a potential well due to electron - phonon coupling , hence , at very low densities , a polaron - like activated mechanism could set in .",
    "actually , the mobility results are consistent with those obtained within the picture of polaron formation @xcite .",
    "the strong charge density dependence on the mobility is , instead , lost at higher temperatures where the chemical potential is always in the tail regions for all the charge densities studied , but more states at higher energies ( of itinerant nature ) get involved providing the main contribution to mobility . as a consequence of the different behavior with charge densities at low and high temperatures ,",
    "the mobility changes its character at intermediate temperatures for low charge carrier densities .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the mobilities look very similar for all the densities considered in the upper panel of fig .",

    "moreover , in this model , polaronic localization seems to take place in the low temperature range for enough low charge densities even if experimental data do not seem to support this scenario .",
    "therefore , a more accurate model for the electron - phonon coupling is needed . as already discussed in subsection @xmath17 ,",
    "the ssh - like coupling with intermolecular vibrational modes is what we need . in the following part of this subsection",
    ", we will analyze the transport properties of that model .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the mobility along the @xmath4 direction is reported as a function of the temperature at fixed coupling @xmath62 and different concentrations @xmath110 .",
    "the plot shows that the absolute magnitude of the mobility substantially agrees with the experimental estimates being @xmath111 @xmath112 at room temperature .",
    "furthermore , the mobility exhibits a band - like power - law @xmath13 behaviour for all the concentrations .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 is evaluated from fits of the mobility providing values in the range @xmath113 , where the highest value is related to the lowest concentration .",
    "this trend is in agreement with experimental measures that for rubrene establish @xmath114 for temperatures @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "a feature , in contrast with the holstein model , is that the mobility increases with decreasing the concentration of carriers .",
    "this trend , already found in 1d ssh model @xcite , points out that the there is no room for a polaronic ( bond ) localization @xcite within the regime of rubrene parameters explored in this review .",
    "another important property is the anisotropy of the transport properties along different in - plane directions @xcite . in our model for rubrene ,",
    "the anisotropy of the mobility along different cristallographic directions is essentially the same as the anisotropy of the effective mass . from the estimates of in - plane hoppings @xmath61 and @xmath60 , the anisotropy of the mobility is evaluated to be of the order of @xmath116 . from experiments @xcite , the anisotropy ratio is about @xmath117 at room temperature , therefore in agreement with our estimate .",
    "however , the experimental data shows that this ratio increases with decreasing temperature . in a recent paper @xcite , where the electron - phonon coupling is slightly more complex than the ssh - like interaction considered in our model ,",
    "the anisotropy of the mobility is less marked than that of the mass . within this paper ,",
    "the anisotropy ratio between the two in - plane mobilities is calculated to be of the order of 0.44 at room temperature ( higher than the experimental value ) , and 0.5 at t=150 k , therefore , it increases with decreasing temperature in agreement with experimental trend .",
    "even if the electron - phonon models are slightly different , the conclusions of our work and these recent calculations are qualitatively consistent .",
    "finally , it has been suggested @xcite that the change in mobility anisotropy upon temperature variation can be explained by a change in transport characteristics ( from band transport to hopping ) .",
    "starting from the mobility , we can determine the scattering time @xmath118 from the relation @xmath119 .",

    "therefore , the transport processes amplify the effects of the electron - phonon interaction and the vertex corrections introduced within our approach are fundamental to take into account this effect .    from the scattering time , one can deduce the mean free path as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the average velocity of the charge carriers .",
    "the quantity @xmath122 is always on the scale of a few lattice parameters .",
    "the most important feature is its temperature behavior . as a consequence of the electron - phonon effects , close to room temperature",
    ", it becomes of the order of half lattice parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the ioffe - regel limit is reached @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the mobility in the ioffe - regel limit is not due to a mass renormalization ( dynamic and/or static ) but it is due to a reduction of the available itinerant states ( the only ones able to transport current ) with the temperature .",
    "we remark that this result is due to the fundamental role played by vertex corrections ( introduced in the previous subsection about the computational methods ) in the calculation of the mobility .",
    "for rubrene and pentacene , the carrier mobility is dominated by inter - molecular phonons since the interaction with intra - molecular modes is almost negligible @xcite and , then , the model discussed in the previous section is considered adequate . on the other hand , in other oligoacenes with a smaller number of benzene rings , the coupling with local modes can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "indeed , the decrease of the number of benzene rings affects the reorganization energy , which can be related to the binding energy of the polaron , that is the quasi - particle formed by the electron ( or hole ) and the surrounding phonon cloud . actually , going from pentacene to naphthalene , the reorganization energy increases nearly twice suggesting a much stronger coupling with local modes @xcite .",
    "therefore , for systems with reduced number of benzene rings like naphthalene , we expect a larger interplay between intra- and inter - molecular modes ( see fig .",

    "the intrisic reduction of the bare band due to local modes provides a simple and direct explanation of the difference in the bandwidth evidenced in the series of oligoacenes from naphthalene ( effective band of the order of @xmath175 ) to pentacene ( effective band of the order of @xmath176 ) .",
    "indeed , it can be ascribed to the decrease of the reorganization energy with increasing the benzene rings of the single molecules that in turn reduces the renormalization effects @xcite . within the polaron theory @xcite ,",

    "<S> spectral and transport properties of small molecule single - crystal organic semiconductors have been theoretically analyzed focusing on oligoacenes , in particular on the series from naphthalene to rubrene and pentacene aiming to show that the inclusion of different electron - phonon couplings is of paramount importance to interpret accurately the properties of prototype organic semiconductors . while , in the case of rubrene , the coupling between charge carriers and low frequency inter - molecular modes is sufficient for a satisfactory description of spectral and transport properties , the inclusion of electron coupling to both low frequency inter - molecular and high frequency intra - molecular vibrational modes is needed to account for the temperature dependence of transport properties in smaller oligoacenes . </S>",
    "<S> + for rubrene , a very accurate analysis in the relevant experimental configuration has allowed to clarify the origin of the temperature dependent mobility observed in these organic semiconductors . with increasing temperature , the chemical potential moves into the tail of the density of states corresponding to localized states , but this is not enough to drive the system into an insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility along different crystallographic directions has been calculated , including vertex corrections that give rise to a transport lifetime one order of magnitude smaller than the spectral lifetime of the states involved in the transport mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility always exhibits a power - law behavior as a function of temperature in agreement with experiments in rubrene . </S>",
    "<S> + in systems gated with polarizable dielectrics , the electron coupling to interface vibrational modes of the gate has to be included in addition to the intrinsic electron - phonon interaction . while the intrinsic bulk electron - phonon interaction affects the behavior of mobility in the coherent regime below room temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling with interface modes is dominant for the activated high temperature contribution of localized polarons . </S>",
    "<S> + finally , the effects of a weak disorder largely increase the activation energies of mobility and induce the small polaron formation at lower values of electron - phonon couplings in the experimentally relevant temperature window . </S>"
