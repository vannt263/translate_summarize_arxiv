    "a galaxy s colours and morphological characteristics supply clues about its star formation and interaction histories .",
    "for example , optical colours allow one to estimate the ages of observed stellar populations ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) , while uv - optical colours are remarkably sensitive to recent star formation ( e.g. , wyder et al .  2007 ) .",
    "morphological characteristics provide information about a galaxy s interaction history , and when combined with the recent star formation history they can be used to estimate the amount of time that has passed since the most recent galaxy merger ( e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "this is particularly useful for investigating potential causes of significant black hole growth ( active galactic nuclei ; agns ) , and possible connections between galaxy interactions and agns have been explored using both theoretical and observational techniques .    many current simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy interactions and evolution incorporate the effects of central supermassive black holes in the initial galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2005a , b , 2008a , b ; croton et al .  2006 ; ciotti & ostriker 2007 ; somerville et al .",
    "the results of these simulations invariably predict that the black holes become active during some stage of a merger event between gas - rich galaxies of similar masses ( a ` major merger ' , typically defined as a merger between galaxies having a mass ratio between 1:1 and 3:1 ) .",
    "most of these authors additionally found that some form of radiative output ( or ` feedback ' ) from the agn significantly decreased the star formation rate in the galaxy .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005a , b , 2008a , b ) described a form of agn feedback that forcefully removes gas from the nuclear regions of a galaxy , after significant star formation and accretion onto the black hole has used up much of the gas .",
    "croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented a complementary scenario , a ` radio mode ' , in which agn feedback heats gas in the nuclear regions to temperatures sufficient to stop star formation , without necessarily removing the gas from the galaxy .",
    "schawinski et al .  ( 2007 ) and georgakakis et al .  (",
    "2008 ) described recent observational support for the scenarios derived from simulations ( such as those summarized above ) and semi - analytic models ( e.g , somerville et al .",
    "after visually examining @xmath416,000 low - redshift early - type galaxies and spectroscopically classifying each as experiencing star formation , black hole growth , a combination of the two , or neither , schawinski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) presented evidence that radiative output from an agn may cause its host galaxy to transition from a star - forming system to a quiescent system .",
    "they reported that the optical colours of the emission - line systems ( 20 per cent of their sample ) are typically bluer than the quiescent systems , and the magnitude of the offset from the red sequence toward the blue cloud depends on the type of activity observed .",
    "most of the systems dominated by emission from low - ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) joined the inactive galaxies populating the red sequence , while the remaining liner and seyfert host galaxies typically exhibited colours on the red edge of the green valley .",
    "early - type systems undergoing star formation were found in the blue cloud , and the systems exhibiting emission lines characteristic of both an agn and star formation typically populated the green valley .",
    "georgakakis et al .  (",
    "2008 ) stacked the x - ray emissions of three samples of galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "the samples were comprised of galaxies with optical colours placing them on the red sequence , the green valley , or the blue cloud , and were limited to systems from which x - rays had not been detected at the limits of the survey .",
    "after stacking , they found significant x - ray detections from the red sequence and green valley samples , but not the blue cloud , indicating the presence of a significant population of obscured agns among red sequence and green valley galaxies .",
    "they concluded that accretion onto the central supermassive black hole may continue after the star formation has ceased , and thus if agn feedback is responsible for the cessation of star formation in these galaxies , then the method by which this occurs does not completely remove gas from the nuclear regions .    in order to accurately compare theoretical predictions to conclusions based on observational studies , it is essential that we understand how the presence of an agn may bias the colour and morphology measurements of its host galaxy .",
    "morphologically , an unobscured agn can be approximated as a point or as a highly concentrated object .",
    "thus morphology measurements would be expected to experience a bias toward more bulge - like or spheroidal systems ; the significance of this bias should depend strongly upon the balance between agn and galactic light contributions . if the bias is significant and common , then we would need to reconsider the current classification of most agn host galaxies as elliptical or early - type ( e.g. , grogin et al .  2003 , 2005 ;",
    "snchez et al .",
    "2004 ; pierce et al .",
    "2007 ) , with occasional morphological evidence of recent interactions ( e.g. , bennert et al .  2008",
    "; urrutia , lacy & becker 2008 ) .",
    "one plausible explanation for the elliptical classification is that agns tend to be observed in galaxies that have recently undergone a merger .",
    "however , if the morphology measurements are significantly biased , then many of the apparently post - merger systems hosting agns may in fact be disc - dominated , necessitating an alternate explanation for the black hole growth .",
    "a potential bias toward elliptical morphologies may also cause an underestimate of the merger rate , as determined by morphology measurements such as @xmath6-@xmath7 ( lotz et al .",
    "thus , the proper classification of agn host galaxy morphologies offers important clues as to when and how significant black hole growth is activated .",
    "in a recent study of agn host galaxy morphologies , gabor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) accounted for the presence of a point source component in the following two ways : ( 1 ) using galfit ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ) to measure two - dimensional surface brightness profiles , gabor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) utilized the option to include a point spread function ( psf ) as a model for the nuclear point source in the fitting procedure ; ( 2 ) they also measured the concentration and asymmetry of the galaxies both before and after subtracting a modeled point source that had been fitted to the agn .",
    "they found that both concentration and asymmetry measurements are affected by the presence ( or subtraction ) of a point source .",
    "for the current study , we do not attempt to model a point source in the galaxies analyzed , but instead focus on understanding the effect that the presence of a point source may have on common morphology measurements . in agn",
    "host galaxies , it is often unclear what fraction of the light emanates from the agn and how much originates in star formation regions . a model of the nuclear light may thus overestimate the agn contribution , and morphology measurements ( such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) of the residual from a subsequent subtraction may experience a different set of biases than those caused by the actual point source .",
    "an investigation of such effects is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "kim et al .  (",
    "2008 ) emphasized the importance of using an appropriate psf for studies similar to that described by gabor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and they found that psf characteristics can vary strongly with time , location on a camera detector , and level of pixel sampling . mismatches between the psf appropriate for a particular agn and the psf(s ) determined for a set of observations may cause inaccurate measurements of the host galaxy and/or agn fluxes . however , in ",
    "[ expt_1:visual_agn ] , we find that the choice of psf is negligible for the present study .",
    "measured colours may also be biased by light contributed by an agn . because optical and uv light from an agn is typically much bluer than the light from its host galaxy ( e.g. , kinney et al .",
    "1996 ) , a significant contribution from the agn to the observed light may cause an intrinsically red agn host galaxy to appear blue or ` green ' , complicating or invalidating the use of colour to describe the host galaxy s star formation history .",
    "snchez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) measured the colours and morphologies of 15 agn host galaxies at @xmath8 , after first subtracting a psf individually determined for each agn . upon comparing the resulting nuclear colours to the host galaxy colours , they found no adverse affects from the psf subtraction .",
    "though a few of their agn host galaxies exhibit red colours , most show colours that are bluer than typical early - type galaxies , indicative of young stellar populations and consistent with the results from schawinski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) described above .",
    "the current paper investigates the biases caused by an agn on five morphology measurements and two colour measurements .",
    "four of the five morphology measurements considered in the current work were initially calibrated without accounting for possible effects due to the presence of active nuclei ( lotz , primack & madau 2004 ) .",
    "the fifth measurement technique includes an option to account for the presence of a point source ( peng et al .",
    "agn contamination of uv - optical colours was recently tested by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who reported that the amount of agn light potentially contaminating measured uv - optical colours should be minimal for low - redshift ( @xmath9 ) , optical spectra - selected agns .",
    "seeking to more fully understand the effect of higher - luminosity and higher - redshift ( @xmath10 ) agns on morphology and colour measurements , this paper presents an examination of the extent to which an agn similar to a quasar or a type-1 seyfert galaxy may affect measurements of the gini coefficient @xmath6 , the second order moment of the brightest 20 per cent of the galaxy s flux @xmath7 , concentration @xmath11 , asymmetry @xmath12 , the srsic index @xmath13 , and optical ( @xmath14 ) and uv - optical ( nuv@xmath3 ) colours .",
    "we begin with a description of the two sets of data used for our experiments (   [ data ] ) , followed by descriptions of the effects of an agn on the measured morphology (   [ expt_1 ] ) and colour (   [ expt_2 ] ) of its host galaxy .",

    "@xmath0 band images analysed here were taken with the f606w filter , using single - orbit exposures and four dithers .",

    "we intentionally exclude agns from our sample because the current study aims to determine the effect that an agn might have on colour and morphology measurements of its host galaxy , and including agns would severely complicate these efforts .",
    "a sample of galaxies meeting these criteria is created from 29 of the 63 _",

    "this sample of 622 galaxies is later refined by imposing criteria designed to assure the reliability of the individual morphology measurements (   [ expt_1:morph_measurements ] ) .",
    "because each of the individual and combined morphology measurements require different criteria , the final samples used for each morphology analysis differ slightly ; additional descriptions of each sample are provided with the results .",
    "spectral templates are available for a variety of agn types , including quasars ( e.g. , francis et al .",
    "1991 ) , liners , and seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , de bruyn & sargent 1978 ) .",
    "compared to a quasar , lower luminosity and/or more heavily obscured agns are expected to less significantly bias the measured host galaxy colours , although some contamination will be unavoidable for all but the most heavily obscured agns .",
    "one goal of the current work is to determine the level of this bias in agn host galaxies .",
    "ideally , we would determine this for all agn types , however , the intervening galactic matter present in obscured agns and the significant light contributions from the host galaxies of lower luminosity agns will contaminate the observed _ agn _ light , biasing the measured colour of the agn itself .",
    "since this is the reverse of the problem that we want to address with the current study , we select a quasar template in order to avoid the potentially significant light contamination from the host galaxy .",
    "although quasars are among the less common and more extreme agn types at redshifts @xmath8 , the current work provides upper limits to the biases in the measured agn host galaxy colours .",

    "this paper describes our method for and results from testing the reliability of common measures of galaxy morphology and colour when an agn contributes a specified fraction of the observed @xmath2 band light .",
    "we emphasize that the work presented here was specifically designed to investigate the limitations of various morphology and colour measurements in the presence of an agn , in part for the sake of better understanding previous results that relied on these measurements without explicitly accounting for the agn light .",
    "others have carefully investigated agn host galaxy morphologies and colours , explicitly removing the agn contribution ( e.g. , snchez et al .",
    "2008 ; gabor et al .  2009 ) , and the reliability of host galaxy / agn decompositions with respect to psf variations ( kim et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "for the first experiment (    [ expt_1 ] ,  [ expt_1:results ] ) , we simulate agns , represented by a @xmath0 band psf , in a sample of aegis galaxies not known to host agns .",
    "we first find that increasing the fraction of observed light contributed by an agn decreases the measured elliptical petrosian radius , which in turn decreases the number of galaxies for which we can determine reliable morphologies (   [ expt_1 ] ) .",
    "this decrease is significant for agn fractions exceeding 20 per cent .",
    "two of the morphology measurements , @xmath11 and @xmath7 , are almost certainly unreliable for agns that contribute more than 20 per cent of the galaxy s @xmath2 band light . by definition , these two measurements depend in part on locating either the central or the brightest 20 per cent of the flux ; if that flux comes directly from an agn , the measurements focus on the agn and may not properly characterize the host galaxy .",
    "the presence of an agn also detrimentally affects measurements of the srsic index and @xmath6 , as expected , though the effects are not inherently unreliable .",
    "in contrast , unless the agn is offset from the geometric centre of the galaxy , @xmath12 remains generally reliable even for high agn fractions .",
    "as described in   [ expt_1:results ] , the results from a similar experiment by simmons & urry ( 2008 ) are complementary to the results presented here .",
    "gabor et al .  ( 2009 ) showed that agn host galaxy concentrations are lower when the agn contribution is first fitted with a psf and then _ subtracted _ from the image , consistent with our results that the _ addition _ of a point source tends to increase the measured concentration .",
    "however , their result that the asymmetry of a galaxy may be artificially low if the agn is not properly accounted for does not seem consistent with the results presented here .",
    "residuals shown by kim et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggest that psf subtraction may sometimes increase the apparent asymmetry of the galaxy , unless the psf is very well matched to the agn being fitted .",
    "though the current work uses only a single psf for all of the simulations , we do not attempt to subtract it from the images ; in addition , we provide galfit with the same psf that we add to the galaxy images",
    ". thus we do not expect to run into problems with this particular issue .",
    "for the second experiment (   [ expt_2 ] ) , we add a quasar spectral template to three non - agn spectral templates to determine how an agn affects the optical and uv - optical colours of its host galaxy .",
    "the quasar spectral template is scaled to contribute a set of specified fractions of the rest - frame @xmath2 band light emanating from the final galaxy / agn systems , and the colours of the original and final systems are measured and compared .",
    "the use of a quasar spectral template avoids the complications which would be introduced by the use of a spectral template representing an obscured agn , such as the effect of the obscuring gas on the agn contribution to the colour of the system .",
    "however , the quasar template represents an extreme example of an agn , meaning that our results regarding the potential colour biases are to be considered upper limits .",
    "quasar light strongly affects the measured uv - optical colours of the simulated quasar host galaxies .",
    "a quasar contributing as little as 5 per cent of the observed @xmath2 band light can move the observed nuv@xmath3 colour of an elliptical galaxy from the uv - optical red sequence to the green valley , and an agn fraction of 20 per cent moves it into the blue cloud .",
    "optical colours are similarly affected .",
    "an agn fraction of 25 per cent shifts the observed optical colour of the elliptical galaxy from the red sequence into the blue cloud .",
    "an encouraging caveat is that there are relatively few agns that have such unobscured quasar spectra , and we expect that such systems would be easily identified by visual inspection of the galaxy images .",
    "snchez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who studied a sample of 15 optically selected , intermediate luminosity , type 1 agns , found that the colours of the early - type galaxies , which comprised much of their sample , tended to be on the blue edge of the red sequence , if not in the blue cloud itself .",
    "having first fitted the agns with psfs and subtracted them from the images , these colours are expected to accurately represent the galaxies without contamination from the agn light .",
    "in contrast , the artificially blue colours that result from the combination of a qso spectrum and a quiescent galaxy spectrum , as shown here , represent an upper limit to the contamination from agn light .    by combining the results from our two experiments (   [ nuvr_morph ] ) , we find that systems for which an agn contributes more than 20 per cent of the @xmath2 band light appear significantly bluer and more bulge - dominated than the underlying galaxy . therefore , we would expect that agns hosted by apparently blue , bulge - dominated galaxies bias the colour and morphology measurements .",
    "pierce ( 2009 ) found that such systems make up less than half of the agn population at @xmath8 , and many of the agns that do fit that description have visible point sources .",
    "red , bulge - dominated agn host galaxies are not expected to experience contamination from the agn light .",
    "based on an inspection of our simulated galaxies , it appears that the point sources in such systems should be visually identifiable for high agn fractions .",
    "the results of pierce et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , in which the authors compare the observed nuclear , extended , and integrated optical colours of galaxies hosting x - ray - selected agns to a corresponding control sample , suggests a low incidence of systems with agn fractions @xmath119 20 per cent because the integrated colours of most of the agn host galaxies correlate much more closely with the extended colours than with the nuclear colours .",
    "employing a collection of simulations , the current study investigates the extent to which various methods used to measure galaxy colours and morphologies may be biased by the presence of an agn .",
    "this is particularly relevant when ( 1 ) considering the significance and timing of the influence that an agn may exert on the star formation rate of its host galaxy ( i.e. , are ` green valley ' agn host galaxies intrinsically red ? ) and ( 2 ) using the morphological characteristics of agn host galaxies to investigate relationships between interactions and the activation of the central supermassive black hole ( i.e. , could the many agn host galaxies classified as bulge - dominated systems actually have disc - like or disturbed morphologies which are hidden because of light from the nuclear regions ? ) .",
    "our results suggest that the answer to the second question is tentatively ` no ' , unless there is a visually identifiable point source .",
    "the answer to the first question is less certain , because we find that the colours may be affected by even a small agn fraction .",
    "however , the quasar template used here represents an extreme ( and relatively rare ) case of an unobscured agn ; an increase in the obscuration of the agn is expected to decrease the colour contamination ( cf .",
    "figure 1 of nandra et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore",
    ", our results are not necessarily inconsistent with earlier results ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "2007 ) , which indicate that galaxies hosting the more numerous agns ( e.g. , seyfert galaxies and liners ) are not likely to suffer significant contamination from the nuclear regions .",
    "measurements of agn host galaxies that indicate bulge - dominated srsic profiles and blue colours are not necessarily biased by light from the agn . studying the aperture colours of agn host galaxies should help to resolve the question of the origin of the blue colour . pierce et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find that x - ray - selected agns hosted by uv - optical green valley galaxies typically exhibit extended optical colours that are similar to the extended colours of a control sample , which suggests that most green valley galaxies hosting agns are intrinsically green and that it is rare for red sequence galaxies to host agns contributing more than @xmath148 per cent of the @xmath2 band light .",

    "<S> we assess the effects of simulated active galactic nuclei ( agns ) on the colour and morphology measurements of their host galaxies . to test the morphology measurements </S>",
    "<S> , we select a sample of galaxies not known to host agns and add a series of point sources scaled to represent specified fractions of the observed @xmath0 band light detected from the resulting systems ; we then compare morphology measurements of the simulated systems to measurements of the original galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> agn contributions @xmath1 per cent bias most of the morphology measurements tested , though the extent of the apparent bias depends on the morphological characteristics of the original galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we test colour measurements by adding to non - agn galaxy spectra a quasar spectrum scaled to contribute specified fractions of the rest - frame @xmath2 band light detected from the resulting systems . </S>",
    "<S> a quasar fraction of 5 per cent can move the nuv@xmath3 colour of an elliptical galaxy from the uv - optical red sequence to the green valley , and 20 per cent can move it into the blue cloud . combining the colour and morphology results , </S>",
    "<S> we find that a galaxy / agn system with an agn contribution @xmath1 per cent may appear bluer and more bulge - dominated than the underlying galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that ( 1 ) bulge - dominated , e / s0/sa , and early - type morphology classifications are accurate for _ red _ agn host galaxies and may be accurate for blue host galaxies , unless the agn manifests itself as a well - defined point source ; and ( 2 ) although highly unobscured agns , such as the quasar used for our experiments , can significantly bias the measured colours of agn host galaxies , it is possible to identify such systems by examining optical images of the hosts for the presence of a point source and/or measuring the level of nuclear obscuration .    </S>",
