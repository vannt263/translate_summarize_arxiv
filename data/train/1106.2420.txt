    "the rotation of the hot star with radiation driven wind leads to compression of the outflowing material towards equatorial regions due to conservation of the angular momentum .",
    "this wind compression model was developed by @xcite .",
    "if the streamlines of gas from both hemispheres do not cross the equator then we are talking about the wind compressed zone ( wcz ) model described by @xcite . in this contribution",
    ", we test the idea if the compression of the enhanced wind from the rotating hot star towards the equatorial regions could create such neutral disk - like structure around the hot star in symbiotic binaries during their active phases , and thus to simulate the above - mentioned hot object structure based on modelling sed .",
    "density in the hot star wind as a function of polar coordinates ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) follows from mass continuity equation @xmath9 where the compression of the wind is described by the geometrical factor @xmath10 which depends on the parameters of the wind as well as on the rotational velocity of the hot star , @xmath11 is the mass loss rate of the active hot star , @xmath12 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath13 is the mass of the hydrogen atom . for the radial component of the wind velocity @xmath14 we adopted @xmath15-law @xmath16 where @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the initial and terminal velocity of the wind , respectively and @xmath20 is the radius of the hot star .",
    "more details about the wind compression model can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the case , when the hot star is the source of both the ionizing photons and the wind particles .",
    "the ionization boundary is defined by the locus of points at which ionizing photons are completely consumed along path outward from the ionizing star .",
    "we calculated the ionization boundary by the equation of photoionization equilibrium which equals the number of ionizations with the number of recombinations .",
    "we assumed optically thick case ( so called `` case b '' or `` on - the - spot approximation '' ) .",

    "further we define the distance from the center of the hot star in units of its radius @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 . for calculating ionization boundary in the hot star wind we derived an equation , which can formally be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath8 are polar coordinates ( @xmath24 at the rotational axis ) , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath15 are parameters of the wind , @xmath25 is the rotational velocity of the hot star , and the value of the parameter @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rate of photons from the hot star , capable of ionizing hydrogen ( it is given by the temperature @xmath29 and luminosity @xmath30 of the ionizing source ) and @xmath31 is the total hydrogenic recombination coefficient in case b. to achieve complete ionization boundary in the hot star wind one has to solve eq .",

    "most of the parameters of the active hot star and its wind in eqs .",

    "however the rotational velocity of the hot star in symbiotic binaries , required for eq .",
    "( [ eqn : calcx ] ) , is not commonly known .",
    "lower limit is given by the rotational velocities of the isolated white dwarfs and upper limit is given by the condition of the considered wcz model , i.e. streamlines of gas do not cross the equator . we found to be the most appropriate to calculate models for different rotational velocities from 100 to 350 km s@xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "1 we show some examples of ionization boundaries for different values of the parameter @xmath26 resulting in creation of a neutral disk - like zone .",
    "we illustrate this case for two different rotational velocities of the central hot star , 200 and 300 km s@xmath2 , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we revealed that there is only a certain range of values of the parameter @xmath26 , for which the neutral disk - like structure can be created near to the equatorial plane of the active hot star .",
    "for higher rotational velocities of the hot star ( i.e. higher compression of the hot star wind towards the equatorial plane ) this range is wider . for a given rotational velocity , small values of the parameter @xmath26 ( @xmath32 ) correspond to ionization boundaries , which are enclosed at a vicinity of the hot star . on the other hand",
    ", increasing value of @xmath26 corresponds to moving the ionization boundary away from the vicinity of the active hot star , as well as to decreasing the opening angle of the neutral disk - like zone until it disappears for very high values of @xmath26 . however , particular values depend also on the parameters of the active hot star wind .    our calculations ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : exam ] ) showed that creation of the neutral disk - like structure requires the value of the parameter @xmath26 to be of the order of hundreds .",
    "figure [ fig : xmdot ] shows the dependence of the parameter @xmath26 on the mass loss rate from the hot star , @xmath11 .",
    "we calculated these dependences for observed parameters of the hot star and its wind , where we used two different combinations of its temperature @xmath29 and luminosity @xmath30 , which were taken from @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xmdot ] we can see that observed mass loss rates from the active hot star , i.e. @xmath0 @xmath1 , correspond to the required values of the parameter @xmath26 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : x ] ) , the parameter @xmath26 strongly depends on the mass loss rate of the hot star @xmath11 as @xmath33 the mass loss rate of the hot star during quiescent phases is by 1 - 2 orders lower than during active phases , which enlarges the parameter @xmath26 so high that no neutral disk - like structure can be created during quiescence .",
    "on the basis of the multiwavelength modelling of the spectral energy distribution of symbiotic binaries , @xcite suggested that neutral disk - like zone is created around the hot star near the orbital plane during active phases . modelling the broad h@xmath34 wings from the optically thin wind of the hot star showed enhancement of its stellar wind by a factor of @xmath35 in activity @xcite .",
    "we found that the compression of the enhanced stellar wind in active phases from the rotating hot star towards equatorial regions can lead to the creation of the neutral disk - like structure around the active hot star .",

    "its shape is very similar to that shown in the schematic figure proposed by @xcite .",
    "finally , we explained that due to a low mass loss rate from the hot star , no neutral disk - like structure can be created during quiescent phases .",
