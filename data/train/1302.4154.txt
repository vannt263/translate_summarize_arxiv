    "dust and high - order molecular co line emission in the host galaxies of the z@xmath116 quasars have been searched for using the max planck millimeter bolometer array ( mambo ) on the iram-30 m telescope @xcite , the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope@xcite , and the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi , @xcite ) . the mambo survey of sdss z@xmath116 quasars at 250 ghz ( typical 1@xmath14 errors of 0.6 mjy ) found that about 30% of them show strong continuum emission from dust at a temperature of 40 to 60 k , with fir luminosities of a few @xmath15 to @xmath16 and inferred dust masses of a few @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "the estimated inclination angles are 46@xmath41 , 56@xmath41 , 24@xmath41 , and 56@xmath41 for j2310 + 1855 , j1319 + 0955 , j2054@xmath430005 , and j0129@xmath430035 , respectively .",
    "this gives inclination angle - corrected dynamical masses of @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "we list the derived inclination angle - corrected dynamical mass @xmath132 in table 3 .",
    "there are no published smbh masses for the four objects yet .",
    "we calculate the @xmath133 to 8 kev quasar bolometric luminosities for the four sources using an isotropic bolometric correction of @xmath134 @xcite , where @xmath135 is the rest - frame 1450 @xmath32 luminosity calculated from the 1450 @xmath32 magnitudes in the discovery papers ( @xcite , fan et al .",
    "2013 , in prep . )",
    "we here assume that the dust extinction from quasar host galaxies at 1450 @xmath32 is negligible .",
    "we then derive the smbh masses ( @xmath136 ) from the quasar luminosity assuming eddington accretion .",
    "the resulting mass ratios @xmath137 lie in the range of 0.012 to 0.030 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath136 and @xmath137 values could be even larger if the typical ratio between quasar bolometric luminosity and eddington luminosity is less than unity ( e.g. @xcite ) or the 1450 @xmath32 luminosities are obscured by the dust in the quasar host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the [ c ii]-based @xmath137 values are consistent with the previous co estimates of the median smbh - bulge mass ratio of these z@xmath116 quasars @xcite and agrees with the results found with other high - z fir and co luminous quasars that the smbh - bulge mass ratios are 10 to 30 times higher than the average value of 0.0014 found in local normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , one should be cautious with these [ c ii]-based @xmath132 values , as the detected [ c ii ] line emission may trace only the intense star forming region in the very centers of quasar host galaxies and not extend as far as the stellar bulge .",
    "this may underestimate the total masses within the spheroidal stellar bulges .",
    "additionally , we notice that there are still large uncertainties in the intrinsic source morphology measurements ; the deconvolved minor axis and position angle measurements of some of the objects show large error bars .",
    "this can introduce significant uncertainties in the inclination and dynamical mass estimate .",
    "further alma imaging of these fir - luminous z@xmath116 quasars at @xmath138 will be crucial to better constrain the distribution and dynamical properties of the gas components , address how well the atomic / molecular line emission traces the dynamical masses of the quasar host galaxies , and determine whether the high @xmath137 ratios is common in the massive quasar - starburst systems in the early universe .",
    "given the sensitivity of the alma band 6 and band 7 data , and the large spectral bandwidth ( 7.5 ghz , or @xmath119000 @xmath22 ) , it is plausible that serendipitous line emission from companion objects will be detected in our data .",
    "although the volume is relatively small over the five fields ( each field was observed across four 1.875ghz spectral windows , covering a redshift range @xmath139 which , for a primary beam with fwhm@xmath140 results in a total surveyed volume of @xmath141 mpc@xmath142 ) , recent alma surveys of submm luminous starburst galaxies at @xmath143 suggest a strong evolution in the [ c ii ] luminosity function out to these early cosmic times ( swinbank et al .",
    "we use a bayesian search algorithm developed to efficiently search for broad , weak line emission in large spectral line data cubes ( lentati et al .",
    "2012 ) , and use the evidence for candidate detections to calculate the probability that detected candidates are real relative to being noise .",
    "we do not find any candidate detections of serendipitous line emission in our data with probabilities above @xmath144 . at the current sensitivity",

    "we detected [ c ii ] fine structure line and dust continuum emission from the host galaxies of five quasars at z@xmath116 , using alma in the cycle 0 phase at @xmath129 resolution .",
    "complementary iram observations of the co ( 6 - 5 ) line and 250 ghz dust continuum emission from the z=6.00 quasar j2310 + 1855 are also presented .",
    "our alma observations measure the fwhm major axis sizes of the [ c ii ] emission from the five objects to be 0.3@xmath21 to @xmath6 ( 1.7 to 3.5 kpc ) and the sizes of the dust continuum source for four of them to 0.2@xmath21 to @xmath8 ( 1.2 to 2.3 kpc ) .",
    "the detections of [ c ii ] line and dust continuum emission indicate active star formation in the central few kpc region of the quasar host galaxies . the derived",
    "[ c ii]-to - fir luminosity ratios are of the order @xmath149 , which are comparable to the typical values found in local ulirgs and other fir - luminous quasars at high redshift .",
    "the intensity - weighted velocity maps of j2310 + 1855 , j1319 + 0950 , and j0129@xmath430035 show velocity gradients .",
    "such velocity gradients are consistent with rotation , although they are not uniquely interpreted as such .",
    "we estimate the dynamical masses within the [ c ii]-emitting region for four of the five objects assuming that the gas is distributed in a rotating disk .",
    "the derived ratios between the smbh masses and the dynamical masses are one order of magnitude higher than that of local normal galaxies .",
    "the detections of [ c ii ] 158@xmath0 m line emission from quasar host galaxies at z@xmath116 have demonstrated the power of alma in observing signatures of star formation at the earliest cosmic epoch . with the full configuration of alma",
    ", we should be able to resolve the line and dust continuum emission on kpc or sub - kpc scales , which will measure the surface densities of the gas components and star forming activity in the nuclear region , and better address the gas kinetics and dynamical masses of the spheroidal quasar host galaxies .",
    "the full frequency coverage of alma will also allow a search of other ionized / atomic interstellar cooling lines from these fir - luminous z@xmath116 quasars to measure the physical conditions ( e.g. density , rediation field , temperature , etc . ) of the interstellar medium in these earliest quasar - starburst systems .",
