    "there is growing evidence that actinide ions may have localized as well as delocalized @xmath3 electrons .",
    "this picture which was suggested by transport measurements @xcite is supported by a great variety of experiments including , e.  g. , photoemission and neutron inelastic scattering experiments on upd@xmath4al@xmath5 @xcite as well as muon spin relaxation measurement in uge@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the assumption is further supported by quantum chemical calculations on uranocene u(c@xmath6h@xmath6)@xmath4 @xcite which exhibit a number of low - lying excitations which are due to rearrangements of the 5@xmath7 electrons .",
    "there are speculations that the presence of localized @xmath8-states might even be responsible for the attractive interactions leading to superconductivity @xcite .",
    "we should like to mention that the dual model should allow for a rather natural description of heavy fermion superconductivity coexisting with 5f - derived magnetism .",
    "the above - mentioned observations form the basis of the dual model which provides a microscopic theory for the heavy quasiparticles in u compounds .",
    "the ansatz conjectures that the delocalized 5 @xmath2 states hybridize with the conduction states and form energy bands while the localized ones form multiplets to reduce the local coulomb repulsion .",
    "the two subsystems interact which leads to the mass enhancement of the delocalized quasiparticles .",
    "the situation resembles that in pr metal where a mass enhancement of the conduction electrons by a factor of 5 results from virtual crystal field ( cef ) excitations of localized 4 @xmath9 electrons @xcite .",
    "the dual ansatz reproduces the dhva data in upt@xmath5 @xcite and upd@xmath4al@xmath5 .",
    "detailed fermi surface studies for uga@xmath5 @xcite and high - resolution photoemission measurements for uru@xmath10si@xmath10 @xcite show that the observed fermi surfaces can not be explained by assuming all 5 @xmath2 electrons to be itinerant or localized .",
    "measurements of the optical conductivity in upd@xmath4al@xmath5 and upt@xmath11 @xcite indicate that the enhanced effective masses m@xmath12 of the quasiparticles should result from the interaction of delocalized states with localized magnetic moments .",
    "the coexistence of itinerant and localized 5 @xmath2 states is referred to as partial localization .",
    "it plays an important role in many intermetallic actinide compounds .",
    "partial localization arises from interplay between the hybridization of the 5 @xmath2 states with the conduction electrons and the local coulomb correlations .",
    "the underlying microscopic mechanism is an area of active current research @xcite .",
    "lda calculations show that the hopping matrix elements for different @xmath1 orbitals vary .",
    "but it is of interest to understand why only the largest one of them is important and why the other ones are suppressed .    in order to justify the above assumption we present model calculations which focus on the interplay between delocalization of 5 @xmath2 states and hund s rule correlations .",
    "the results @xcite clearly show how partial localization can arise in 5 @xmath2 systems .",
    "in addition , they suggest rather complex phase diagrams depending upon the strengths of the hopping matrix referring to different orbital elements .",
    "variation of the intersite hopping by applying ( hydrostatic ) pressure should lead to new types of ( quantum ) phase transitions .",
    "we think the present model could be used to study the pressure dependence of the magnetization in uge@xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the full model hamiltonian , we investigate a simplified version which treats the local coulomb interaction in close analogy to lda+u .",
    "the results allow us to assess the general validity of this popular approximation scheme .",
    "finally we compare the results of the full model hamiltonian with those obtained from a hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we calculate the heavy quasiparticles in upt@xmath0 and upd@xmath10al@xmath0 within the dual model considering two of the 5@xmath7 electrons as localized , in agreement with the absence of any kramers doublets in cases where a crystalline electric field ( cef ) splitting of u states has been observed .",
    "the calculation of the heavy bands proceeds in three steps as described in @xcite : first , the band - structure is determined by solving the dirac equation for the self - consistent lda potentials but excluding the u 5@xmath7   j=@xmath13 , j@xmath14=@xmath15 and j@xmath14=@xmath16 states from forming bands .",
    "the localized 5@xmath7 orbitals are accounted for in the self - consistent density and , concomitantly , in the potential seen by the conduction electrons .",
    "the intrinsic bandwidth of the itinerant u 5@xmath7 j=@xmath13 , j@xmath14=@xmath17 electrons is taken from the lda calculation while the position of the corresponding band - center c is chosen such that the density distribution of the conduction states as obtained within lda remains unchanged.the @xmath7 occupancy per u atom for the delocalized 5@xmath7 electrons amounts to n@xmath18 = 0.65 indicating that we are dealing with a mixed valent situation .",
    "the calculated dh - va frequencies agree rather well with the observed ones @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : heavyfermisurfacecrosssections ] .",
    "we also include the corresponding results for upd@xmath10al@xmath0 which are compared to experimental data from @xcite .",

    "the coulomb matrix elements are calculated from the radial functions of the ab - initio band structure potentials .",
    "we find a doubly degenerate ground state with j@xmath19 = @xmath20 which must be an eigenstate of j = 4 and has an overlap of 0.865 with the hund s rule ground state @xmath21 derived from the ls - coupling scheme . in the hexagonal symmetry , the two - fold degeneracy of the ground - state is lifted by a cef yielding the two states and .",
    "note that @xmath22 has been suggested as ground state of upd@xmath4al@xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the splitting energy @xmath23 between @xmath22 and @xmath24 is of order 20 mev for upt@xmath0 .",
    "the coupling between the localized and delocalized @xmath7 electrons is directly obtained from the expectation values of the coulomb interaction u@xmath25 in the 5@xmath26 states @xmath27 .    finally , we determine the renormalization of the effective masses which results from the coupling between the two @xmath8 subsystems .",
    ".measured and calculated effective masses of upt@xmath0 for various directions of the magnetic field [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the enhancement factor is calculated from the self - consistent solution of the self - energy equation @xcite with the input taken from ab - initio electronic structure calculations for the delocalized and the localized 5 @xmath2 electrons .",
    "the density of states with two localized 5 @xmath2 electrons is n(0 ) @xmath28 15.5 states/(ev cell ) , the 5 @xmath2-weight per spin and u atom of the band states amounts to 4a@xmath29=0.13 while the transition matrix element between the low - lying singlet states in the localized 5 @xmath30 shell in the presence of a cef equals @xmath31m@xmath32=0.036 e v@xmath29 .",
    "the only adjusted parameter is the energy @xmath33 characterizing the centers of gravity of the cef excitations . by comparison with other u compounds such as upd@xmath10al@xmath0 we estimate @xmath34 20 mev",
    "this general concept reproduces the quasiparticles rather well as can be seen from the results summarized in table [ tab : effmassesupt3 ] .",
    "a similar analysis applies for upd@xmath10al@xmath0 .",
    "the calculations start from small clusters which model the u sites in heavy fermion compounds .",
    "we keep only the degrees of freedom of the 5f shells the conduction states being accounted for by ( effective ) anisotropic intersite hopping . here",
    "we consider the two - site model .",

    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath35 here @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , create ( annihilate ) an electron at site @xmath38 ( = 1,2 ) in the @xmath39 state with @xmath40 .",
    "the effective hopping between the sites is chosen to be diagonal in the orbital index @xmath41 which seems to be compatible with lda calculations for the u - based heavy - fermion systems upt@xmath5 and upd@xmath4al@xmath5 . the local coulomb repulsion @xmath42 depends upon the coulomb matrix elements @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the total angular momentum and @xmath45 .",
    "the sum is restricted to even values of @xmath46 , i. e. , @xmath47 to satisfy the antisymmetry requirement . in the actual calculations ,",

    "the character of the ground state , however , changes as can be seen by considering the total magnetization @xmath54 of the ground state displayed in figure [ fig : jzrestrictedmodel ] . the phase diagram is strongly affected by magnetic fields .",
    "standard electronic structure calculations for extended systems such as the hartree - fock method or an lda+u - type ansatz generally overestimate the stability of the ferromagnetic phases and fail to describe the subtle breaking - up of the hund s rule correlations .",
