    "the notion of spectrum generating algebra ( sga ) , sometimes called non invariance algebra , was introduced many years ago @xcite . in the context of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the idea of the sga consists in reducing the construction of the whole hilbert space for a given system to a problem of representation theory .",
    "the knowledge of the symmetry ( usually called ` dynamical symmetry ' ) of a problem allows to solve it only partly : its representations gives the subspace of the whole hilbert space of eigenstates corresponding to a fixed energy .",
    "the further extension to the sga needs to introduce ladder operators that change the energy , i.e. , operators that do not commute with the hamiltonian ( it is the reason to call this construction non - invariance algebra ) . at the very best ,",
    "the whole set of operators those generating the dynamical algebra plus the ladder operators may form a finite dimensional non - compact algebra whose representation gives the hilbert space of the system . in this respect ,",
    "the symmetry algebra of the hamiltonian plays the role of the cartan subalgebra , while the additional operators of the sga , which do not commute with the hamiltonian , play the role of the borel elements .    in the classical frame",
    ", the symmetry algebra provides constants of motion which are functions of the dynamical variables characterizing the possible trajectories .",
    "however , the motion is obtained from another kind of constants of motion that include explicitly the time .",
    "such constants come from the elements of the sga ` not commuting ' ( in the sense of poisson brackets ) with the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is using the sga technique to solve the spectral problem related with the quantum hamiltonian of the free motion in the three dimensional sphere @xmath0 , embedded in the four dimensional coordinate space @xmath3 , which has a pure discrete spectrum @xcite .",
    "this problem is already nontrivial , interesting by itself and will provide important clues for the extension of the sga in the study of more general quantum systems evolving on configuration spaces with constant curvature . in the case of the free particle in @xmath0",
    ", it is well known that the symmetry algebra is @xmath4 and our task is to construct the ladder operators which do not commute with the hamiltonian . as we shall see below in order to achieve this goal",
    "we will need to involve , apart from symmetry operators , also the elements of the homogenous space of the group @xmath5 .",
    "the main result obtained in this work is the explicit construction of a sga isomorphic to @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that this is a new method to study classical and quantum systems in configuration spaces of nonzero constant curvature .",
    "however , the study of such systems is not new up to the extent that schrdinger himself has obtain the levels of energy of the kepler problem in @xmath0 , see @xcite .",
    "for other approaches , see @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 begins with the construction of the sga for the free particle in @xmath0 in the classical context .",
    "this is a good starting point , as it will give us hints for the construction of the quantum sga of the same problem .",
    "however , the classical version is much simpler , as is free of the important and hampering difficulties of the ordering of non - commuting operators , which is specific of the quantum case . in this section",
    "we will also show how we can use the sga in order to solve the classical equations of motion . in section 3 , we shall present the detailed construction of the sga for the quantum problem . here , we have adopted the point of view of a direct quantization of the classical sga and choose the representation by means of some natural restrictive relations .",
    "the hilbert space of states will be explicitly derived with the help of the sga through ladder operators . at the very end , we obtain position and momentum operators along to constraint and gauge fixing relations compatible with @xmath0 . in section 4 , we adopt the opposite point of view .",
    "we start with canonical quantizations of the classical dirac brackets for the variables position and momentum with their corresponding constraint and gauge condition compatible with @xmath0",
    ". then determine the sga , as well as the ladder operators .",
    "we also derive the restrictive relations as a consequence of our definitions . finally , we present the concluding remarks and some indications for future research .",
    "we shall start with the lagrangian of the free motion in @xmath0 , considered as a sphere of radius one , @xmath7 where the dot represents the derivative with respect to time and we have assumed @xmath8 , since the mass do not play any relevant role in our development .",
    "this lagrangian can be considered the restriction to the sphere @xmath0 of the free lagrangian @xmath9 defined in the ambient space @xmath3 .",
    "the canonical momenta are determined by @xmath10 and satisfies the primary constraint    @xmath11    @xmath12 , where here and throughout the paper the convention of summation over repeated indices is used ( in this respect , latin subindexes @xmath13 will run from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , the dimension of the ambient space ) .",
    "the legendre transformation of the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) gives the canonical hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 has the structure of an angular momentum .",
    "our strategy to work in @xmath0 will be the following .",
    "instead of dealing in the 8-dimensional phase space with dynamical variables @xmath18 satisfying the canonical poisson brackets , we impose the gauge fixing condition @xmath19 and the primary constrain ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "according to the usual procedure @xcite , we also introduce the dirac brackets @xmath20 in the sequel , we prefer to use the variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 subject to the dirac brackets ( [ dirac ] ) instead of defining a set of independent variables in @xmath0 , because this would lead us to very complicated expressions .",
    "therefore , from now on , as we will work in the configuration space @xmath0 where only dirac brackets will be appropriate , the label @xmath23 ( such as it appears in ( [ dirac ] ) ) will be suppressed .",
    "it is interesting to remark in passing that we can supply a realization of the variables @xmath21 , @xmath24 in terms of canonical variables and the usual poisson brackets .",
    "let us consider the canonical variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the associated poisson brackets ,    @xmath27    then , let us define the following relations    @xmath28    and also dirac brackets by    @xmath29    where in the last expression the functions depending on @xmath30 have been obtained by the replacement of @xmath31 given in ( [ xipi ] ) .",
    "then , ( [ xipi ] ) , ( [ poisson ] ) gives us the desired representation .",
    "from now on , we shall consider dirac brackets only , so that the subindex @xmath23 in brackets like ( [ dirac ] ) will be omitted in the sequel .",
    "the components @xmath17 of the angular momentum introduced in ( [ 3 ] ) satisfy the following ` commutation ' relations : @xmath32   \\{j_{ik},x_l\\ } & = & \\delta_{lk } x_i-\\delta_{il}x_k\\ , , \\label{6}\\\\[1ex ]    \\{j_{ik},p_l\\ } & = & \\delta_{lk } p_i-\\delta_{il}p_k\\ , , \\label{6b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which coincide with those well known using canonical poisson brackets .",
    "hence , the elements @xmath17 are the generators of the lie algebra @xmath4 of the group @xmath5 .",
    "this lie algebra has two casimirs : @xmath33   c_2 & = & \\epsilon_{ijkl}j_{ij}j_{kl}= \\bf { xp } = 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the only nontrivial casimir plays the role of the hamiltonian @xmath34 and it can be seen as the restriction to @xmath0 of the free hamiltonian defined in the ambient space . consequently , the symmetry algebra is just @xmath4 itself , but taking into account that this symmetry is realized by a representation in which the second casimir ( [ 8 ] ) vanishes .    in the rest of this section",
    "we will show that what can be called the ` classical ' sga for this system has the structure of the @xmath6 algebra , including the aforementioned realization of @xmath4 as a subalgebra .",
    "the generators of the lie algebra @xmath6 will be labeled @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "they include the generators of the symmetry algebra in the form @xmath37 .",
    "the new generators completing the ` classical ' sga are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , that behave as vectors with respect to @xmath5 and @xmath40 which is an @xmath5scalar .",
    "these generators can be displayed schematically in the form of a @xmath41 antisymmetric matrix as follows : @xmath42 \\begin{array}{c }    m_{5i } \\\\[1ex ]    m_{6i } \\end{array }              & \\begin{array}{cc }                   0 & m_{56 } \\\\[1ex ]                   m_{65 } & 0                 \\end{array }               \\\\",

    "we need two @xmath5 vectors and one @xmath5 scalar . from ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 6b ] ) , the vectors at hand are @xmath50 and @xmath51 ,",
    "while the scalar is just @xmath34 , therefore we can make the following guess for these generators : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are functions to be determined .",
    "remark that due to the specific realization we have @xmath54 since the dirac brackets for @xmath22 in @xmath0 are not familiar ( see ( [ dirac ] ) ) , we prefer to use the equivalent expression ( [ pjx ] ) , because its factors obey the dirac brackets with the familiar form ( [ dirac])([6 ] ) .",
    "the final solution in this classical frame can be easily obtained : @xmath55    making use of the ` classical ' sga , we can solve the equation of motion for the present case . to this end , let us introduce the functions @xmath56 as the following linear combinations of @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath57 the importance of the @xmath5 vectors @xmath56 will have quite different implications in the classical and quantum cases .",
    "clearly , the equations of motion for @xmath56 are given by @xmath58 where the dot denotes derivative with respect time . then , ( [ 22 ] ) gives : @xmath59 which provide the motion @xmath60 .",
    "notice that the frequency @xmath61 depends on @xmath34 and increases as the system has higher energies .",
    "another way to express ( [ 23 ] ) is to say that @xmath62 are time - dependent constants of motion whose values @xmath63 are fixed from the initial conditions .",
    "therefore , the symmetries lead to ( time - independent ) constants of motion , while the other sga elements lead in this way to explicit time - dependent constants of motion giving the motion .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath64 is a time - independent @xmath5 scalar function , that can be computed explicitly : @xmath65 so that the amplitudes @xmath66 in ( [ 23 ] ) also depend on the hamiltonian .",
    "we can also compute the value of the quadratic casimir of @xmath6 with the help of ( [ amplitude ] ) : @xmath67 we see that ( [ 24 ] ) also gives ( [ amplitude ] ) .    as a final remark",
    ", we shall note that some _ restrictive relations _ among the algebra generators are fulfilled .",
    "these relations will have a crucial role in the construction of the quantum sga for the quantum case .",
    "in fact , a rather straightforward calculation show that the tensors given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the complete antisymmetric tensor , vanish identically , i.e. ,    @xmath70    we shall call relations ( [ 2.28 ] ) _ restrictive relations _ for the algebra @xmath71 .",
    "these relations are not changed under the action of the algebra since a direct calculation using ( [ 10 ] ) gives :    @xmath72    a similar relation holds for @xmath73 .    here , we conclude the discussion of the classical sga for @xmath0 .",
    "let us analyze the quantized version of the discussion given in the previous section .",
    "we shall adopt a point of view of starting with the quantized version of ( [ 10 ] ) . in any case and by analogy with the classical case",
    ", we shall work in a realization in which the casimirs for the symmetry algebra @xmath4 are the free hamiltonian    @xmath74    and    @xmath75    we shall present the discussion of the quantum case in the next following subsections .      the symmetry algebra of @xmath34 is clearly determined by the operators @xmath76 that close the algebra @xmath4 .",
    "we recall ( see for instance @xcite ) that the algebra @xmath4 is the direct sum of two copies of @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 . if we group the six generators @xmath76 as the components of two vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 , then the generators of each copy of @xmath77 are given by @xmath81)/2 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath77 casimirs are @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian in ( [ 28 ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath85    the hilbert space spanned by the states with the same energy support a unitary irreducible representation ( uir ) of @xmath5 .",
    "however , we must take into account that in this particular realization we have that @xmath86 , so that the value for both of the casimirs for @xmath77 coincides : @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "then , each representation supported by states with the same energy is symmetric and hence the spectrum of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath89 the @xmath90-th energy level has the value @xmath91 for each of the @xmath77components , and consequently the degeneracy of this energy level is @xmath92 .      to begin with ,",
    "let us take the quantized version of formula ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this quantized formula gives us the relation between the generators of @xmath46 , where these generators are operators on a certain hilbert space and the dirac brackets have been replaced by commutators .",

    "we need to find some restrictive relations for the generators of the algebra @xmath6 .",
    "this reflect the fact that , in general , the hilbert space obtained with this technique is not the hilbert space which supports a general representation of @xmath46 .",
    "this kind of restrictive relations is very well known , although not very well identified often .    in order to understand this fact ,",

    ", it becomes clear that the space in which this condition is satisfied corresponds to the choice of @xmath109 . for higher values of the spin ,",
    "the restrictive relations for @xmath101 involve higher powers of @xmath104 .    in the case of a non compact algebra like @xmath6 ,",
    "the situation is more complicated so that even a quadratic restriction relation may define a subspace @xmath107 of infinite dimension .",
    "thus , the first problem that we have to solve is to find a general expression for the restrictive relations concerning @xmath46 .",
    "these restrictive relations will be given by operators ( as in ( [ 3.7 ] ) such that their commutators with the generators @xmath110 are linear on these operators .",
    "this task is not difficult if we construct the operators providing the restrictive relations as tensors constructed from @xmath110 .",
    "one more remark is in order here .",
    "as we have seen in the classical case , all generators of @xmath46 ( 6 + 4 + 4 + 1=15 ) , were build by using @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this shows the existence of some relations between the @xmath110 . in the quantum case",

    "in our representation we have changed the meaning of the objects @xmath110 that do not represent functions any more like in ( [ 2.27 ] ) , but hermitian operators instead .",
    "since these operators do not commute , we have to symmetrize ( [ 2.27 ] ) so that the new expression for @xmath111 should be given by    @xmath112    which is covariant with respect to the generators of @xmath46 :    @xmath113=i(g_{ac}t_{bd}-g_{bc}t_{ad}+g_{ad}t_{cb}-g_{bd}t_{ca})\\,.\\ ] ]    needless to say that ( [ 3.10 ] ) replaces ( [ 2.29 ] ) in the present discussion .",
