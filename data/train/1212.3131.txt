    "the study of hadron beta decays gives important information on the interplay between the weak interaction and hadron structure determined by the strong interaction . in this framework ,",
    "measurements on @xmath3 semileptonic decays and on the related parameters are fundamental to further increase our knowledge on the constituents of the baryon octet .",
    "in particular , a clear evidence for the decay @xmath0 and a measurement of its branching ratio will add one more constraint to the theoretical frameworks  @xcite built to explain the behaviour of the baryon semileptonic decays .    in the present article",
    "the branching ratio of the semileptonic decay @xmath0 is measured by normalizing to the analogue decay with an electron in the final state , already studied by the na48/1 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the similar topologies of the final states of the two semileptonic decays allowed the same trigger conditions to be used for both data samples .",
    "the selection criteria are also similar between the two channels and only differ for the identification of the charged lepton and for cuts related to background rejection .",
    "this decay had already been observed by the ktev collaboration  @xcite , with a sample of 9 events and a branching ratio measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "the experiment was performed in 2002 at the cern sps accelerator and used a 400  gev proton beam impinging on a be target to produce a neutral beam .",
    "the spill length was 4.8  s out of a 16.2  s cycle time .",
    "the proton intensity was fairly constant during the spill with a mean of @xmath5 particles per pulse .    for this measurement ,",
    "only the @xmath6 target station of the na48 double @xmath7 beam line  @xcite was used to produce the neutral beam . in this configuration ,",
    "the @xmath8 beam was blocked and an additional sweeping magnet was installed to deflect charged particles away from the defining section of the @xmath9 collimators . to reduce the number of photons in the neutral beam originating primarily from @xmath10 decays ,",
    "a 24  mm thick platinum absorber was placed in the beam between the target and the collimator . a pair of coaxial collimators , having a total thickness of 5.1  m , the axis of which formed an angle of 4.2  mrad to the proton beam direction , selected a beam of neutral long - lived particles ( @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the target position and the production angle were chosen in such a way that the beam axis was hitting the center of the electromagnetic calorimeter .    in order to minimize the interaction of the neutral beam with air ,",
    "the collimator was immediately followed by a @xmath15  m long evacuated tank terminated by a 0.3@xmath16 @xmath17 thick kevlar window .",
    "the na48 detector was located downstream of this region .    on average ,",
    "about @xmath18 @xmath3 per spill , with an energy between 70 and 220  gev , decayed in the fiducial decay volume .",
    "the detector was designed for the measurement of @xmath19 , and a detailed description of the experimental layout is available at  @xcite . in the following sections a short description of the main detectors is reported .",
    "the detector included a spectrometer housed in a helium gas volume with two drift chambers before and two after a dipole magnet with an horizontal transverse momentum kick of 265 mev/_c_. each chamber had four views ( _ x , y , u , v _ ) , each of which had two sense wire planes .",
    "the resulting space points were typically reconstructed with a resolution of @xmath20  @xmath21 m in each projection .",
    "the spectrometer momentum resolution is parameterized as :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is in gev/_c_. this gave a resolution of 3 mev/_c_@xmath24 when reconstructing the kaon mass in @xmath25decays .",
    "the track time resolution was @xmath26  ns .",
    "the detection and measurement of the electromagnetic showers were achieved with a liquid krypton calorimeter ( lkr ) , 27 radiation lengths deep , with a @xmath272  cm @xmath28 2  cm cell cross - section .",
    "the energy resolution , expressing @xmath29 in gev , is parameterized as  @xcite :    @xmath30    the transverse position resolution for a single photon of energy larger than 20 gev was better than 1.3 mm , and the corresponding mass resolution for the reconstructed @xmath10 mass ( @xmath31 decay ) was @xmath271 mev/_c_@xmath24 .",
    "the time resolution of the calorimeter for a single shower was better than @xmath32  ps .",
    "a scintillator hodoscope ( chod ) was located between the spectrometer and the calorimeter .",
    "it consisted of two planes , segmented in horizontal and vertical strips and arranged in four quadrants .",
    "further downstream there was an iron - scintillator sandwich hadron calorimeter ( hac ) , followed by muon counters consisting of three planes of scintillator , each shielded by an 80  cm thick iron wall .",
    "the first two planes @xmath33 and @xmath34 were the main muon counters and had 25  cm wide horizontal and vertical scintillator strips respectively , with a length of 2.7  m. the third plane , @xmath35 , had horizontal strips 44.6  cm wide , and was mainly used to measure the efficiency of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 counters .",
    "the central strip in each plane was divided into two sections separated by a gap of 21  cm , in order to accommodate the beam pipe .",
    "the fiducial volume of the experiment was principally determined by the lkr calorimeter acceptance , together with seven rings of scintillation counters ( akl ) used to veto activity outside this region .",
    "the trigger system used for the on - line selection of @xmath3 semileptonic decays mainly consisted of two levels of logic .",
    "level 1 ( l1 ) was based on logic combinations of fast signals coming from various sub - detectors .",
    "it required hits in the chod and in the first drift chamber compatible with at least one and two tracks respectively , no hit in the akl veto system and a minimum energy deposition in the calorimeters .",
    "this last requirement was 15  gev for the energy reconstructed in the lkr calorimeter or 30  gev for the summed energy in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters .",
    "the output rate of the l1 stage was about 50  khz .",
    "the average l1 efficiency , measured with @xmath36 events of energy greater than 70  gev , was found to be @xmath37 .",
    "level 2 ( l2 ) consisted of a set of 300  mhz processors that reconstructed tracks and vertices from hits in the drift chambers and computed relevant physical quantities .",
    "the l2 trigger required at least two tracks with a closest distance of approach of less than 8  cm in space and a transverse separation greater than 5  cm in the first drift chamber .",
    "since the signature of the @xmath12 @xmath38-decay involves the detection of an energetic proton from the subsequent @xmath39 decay , the ratio between the higher and the lower of the two track momenta was required to be larger than 3.5 .",
    "rejection of the overwhelming @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays was achieved by applying stringent invariant mass cuts against these decays .",
    "the output l2 trigger rate was about 2.5  khz .",
    "the efficiency of the l2 trigger stage with respect to level 1 , averaged over the 2002 run , was measured to be @xmath42 for @xmath3 @xmath38-decays , mainly limited by wire inefficiencies in the drift chambers .",
    "the identification of the @xmath43 channel was performed using the subsequent decay @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the final state consists of a proton and a muon , giving two tracks in the spectrometer , two photons producing clusters in the lkr calorimeter and one unobserved anti - neutrino .",
    "the decay @xmath46 is the only source of @xmath47 particles in the neutral beam since the two - body decay @xmath48 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "thus , the signal events were identified by requiring an invariant @xmath49 mass consistent with the nominal @xmath47 mass value .",
    "the @xmath47 decay was reconstructed using a positive charged track in the spectrometer ( associated to the proton ) and two clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( associated to the photons from @xmath50 decay ) within a time window of 2  ns .",
    "the longitudinal position of the @xmath47 decay vertex was determined using the @xmath10 mass constraint to calculate the distance of its decay point from the calorimeter : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the measured energies of the two clusters and @xmath54 is the distance between the two clusters in the transverse plane .",
    "good candidates were kept if the reconstructed @xmath49 invariant mass was within 6  mev/_c_@xmath24 of the nominal @xmath47 mass value .",
    "the mass interval was tightened from 8  mev/_c_@xmath24 to 6  mev/_c_@xmath24 with respect to the normalization channel ( see below ) to reduce the higher background contamination in the muon channel .",
    "muon identification was achieved by requiring the presence of in - time signals from the first two planes of the muon detector ( @xmath552  ns with respect to the time measured in the charged hodoscope ) .",
    "in addition , to reject pions and electrons , the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter in association to the muon track was required to be less than 2.5  gev .",
    "the lower momentum threshold for the muon track was set to 7  gev/_c _ ( it was 4  gev/_c _ for the electron channel ) to reduce the background contamination and to increase the efficiency for muon reconstruction ( see section [ measurement ] ) .    the muon momentum calculated in the @xmath47 rest frame",
    "was required to be less than 0.125  gev/_c _ , exploiting the fact that no contribution is expected from the signal sample above this limit .",
    "this cut was not applied in the normalization channel .",
    "similarly , since the proton momentum in the signal sample is mostly above 54  gev/_c _ , this criterion was used to enhance the probability that sufficient energy is deposited in the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters to satisfy the trigger condition @xmath56  gev . in the normalization channel the lower cut on the proton momentum",
    "was set at 40  gev/_c_.    the @xmath12 decay vertex position was obtained by computing the closest distance of approach between the extrapolated @xmath47 line - of - flight and the muon track .",
    "this distance was required to be less than 4  cm .",
    "furthermore , the deviation of the transverse @xmath12 vertex position from the nominal line - of - flight defined by a straight line going from the center of the @xmath6 target to the center of the liquid krypton calorimeter was required to be less than 3  cm .",
    "the longitudinal position of the @xmath12 vertex was required to be at least 6.5  m downstream of the @xmath6 target , i.e. 0.5  m after the end of the final collimator and at most 40  m from the target .",
    "similarly , the @xmath47 vertex position was required to be at least 6.5  m downstream of the target but at most 50  m from the target .",
    "the latter value was chosen larger than the upper limit for the @xmath12 vertex position to account for the lifetime of the @xmath47 particle . the longitudinal separation between the @xmath12 and @xmath47 decay vertices",
    "was required to be between @xmath57  m and @xmath58  m. the negative lower limit , tuned with monte carlo events , was chosen such as to take properly into account resolution effects .",
    "the quantity @xmath59 was defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the energy of the detected particle and @xmath62 the corresponding transverse position vector at the liquid krypton calorimeter position @xmath63 . for a charged particle ,",
    "the quantity @xmath62 was obtained from the extrapolation to @xmath63 of the upstream segment of the associated track . for kinematical reasons , the missing transverse momentum ( @xmath64 ) is smaller in the muon case with respect to the electron case .",
    "therefore @xmath59 was required to be less than 8  cm instead of 15  cm as for the electron channel .    by requiring the invariant mass @xmath65 to be less than 0.490  gev@xmath66",
    ", the contamination from @xmath67 , when the @xmath68 is misidentified as a muon , was reduced to a negligible level .",
    "this cut was not applied in the normalization channel .",
    "cuts were also applied on the positions of the hit points of the tracks in the chambers and on the cluster positions in the electromagnetic calorimeter to improve the trigger and the reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "furthermore the energies of the photons coming from the @xmath69 decay were requested to be between 3 and 100  gev to ensure linearity on the lkr measurement .    with the above selection criteria , 97 @xmath70 candidates were observed in the signal region .",
    "the distribution of events in the @xmath49 invariant mass variable is shown in figure [ signal ] after all selection cuts were applied .",
    "signal events peaking around the @xmath47 mass are clearly visible above the background .",
    "a contribution to the background ( about @xmath71 of the total ) comes from overlapping events in the detector ( accidentals ) .",
    "this contribution was estimated directly from data samples , looking to the activity in the detectors not in time with the main event time .",
    "there is a small contribution to the background from the decay @xmath72 ( populating the left side of the @xmath73 invariant mass distribution ) with @xmath74 and with @xmath68 either misidentified as a muon or decaying into @xmath75 .",
    "this contribution was estimated by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "however the main contribution to the background is due to scattered events in the final collimator of the neutral beam , in analogy to what was seen in the normalization channel .",
    "invariant mass distribution for @xmath76 candidates after all selection criteria were applied .",
    "points with error bars are data .",
    "the peak at the @xmath77 mass value shows clear evidence for the signal .",
    "the vertical dashed lines delimit the signal region .",
    "the background was evaluated with a likelihood fit of the data performed in two intervals , between 1.164 and 1.180  gev@xmath78 and between 1.198 and 1.240  gev@xmath78 .",
    "the solid histogram shows the sum of the background contribution ( evaluated from the fit ) and the monte carlo sample of the signal normalized to the events found in the data after background subtraction.,width=453 ]    due to the difficulty to simulate this contribution and due to the low statistics in the control samples coming from data , the background distribution in the @xmath49 invariant mass was fitted with an exponential in the intervals 1.164 - 1.180  gev@xmath78 and 1.198 - 1.240  gev@xmath78 .",
    "the fit was giving an estimate of @xmath79 background events when extrapolated into the signal region .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the background level was estimated by varying the fitting function and the fit region ( also including the signal region , with the signal fitted with a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "the data sample for the normalization channel @xmath80 consists of 6316 events with a background of @xmath81 .",
    "a detailed description of the reconstruction and selection for the normalization channel is reported in  @xcite .",
    "for that decay , since the electron is completely absorbed in the lkr , the corresponding track was identified by requiring a ratio between the energy deposit in the lkr and the momentum measured by the spectrometer ( e / p ) greater than 0.85 and lower than 1.15 .",
    "the other differences in the selection criteria of the signal and normalization channels are described above .",
    "the acceptance for both signal and normalization decay channels was computed using a detailed monte carlo program based on geant3  @xcite .",
    "particle interactions in the detector material as well as the response functions of the different detector elements were taken into account in the simulation .",
    "a detailed description of the generator of the electron channel can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the generator for the muon channel was modified to include the contribution from pseudo - scalar currents  @xcite , parameterized with the form factor @xmath82 which , under partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis , can be extracted at @xmath83 from the goldberg - treiman relation  @xcite : @xmath84 since the @xmath85 term is multiplied by @xmath86 , its contribution is non - negligible for the muon case  @xcite . using the available experimental results  @xcite for the electron channel ,",
    "the best estimates for the remaining non - vanishing form factors are : @xmath87 the central values were plugged into the monte carlo generator and the corresponding errors were used to evaluate the systematic error related to the acceptance calculation .",
    "radiative corrections were not included in the generator of the muon channel .",
    "this leads to a systematic uncertainty of 1@xmath16 , estimated using the monte carlo simulation for the electron channel with the electron mass substituted by the muon one .",
    "the acceptance for the signal @xmath76 was calculated to be ( 3.17 @xmath55 0.01)@xmath16 , while the acceptance for the normalization @xmath80 was ( 2.49 @xmath55 0.01)@xmath16 .",
    "both quoted uncertainties originate from the statistics of the monte carlo samples .",
    "the @xmath88 branching ratio was obtained from the background - subtracted numbers of selected events for signal and normalization , the corresponding acceptance values , the normalization branching ratio  @xcite and the efficiency on muon identification .",
    "these quantities are summarized in table [ brcalc ] and yield : @xmath89 where the statistical uncertainty originates from the event statistics and the systematic one is the sum in quadrature of the various contributions presented in table [ systematics ] .",
    ".parameters used for the br(@xmath88 ) measurement .",

    "using data collected in 2002 with the na48 detector at cern , we obtain clear evidence of the decay @xmath0 , with a precision on the branching ratio being significantly better than the existing published value : @xmath90 this result is in good agreement with the branching ratio measured by the na48/1 collaboration for the electron channel , once the theoretical ratio of the corresponding decay amplitudes is taken into account  @xcite .",
