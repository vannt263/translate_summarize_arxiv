    "in 1932 e. majorana introduced a way to represent the pure states of a spin-@xmath1 particle in terms of symmetrized states of @xmath2 spin-@xmath3 particles @xcite .",
    "this representation , known as the majorana representation , makes it possible to express spin-@xmath1 states geometrically as @xmath2 points on the bloch sphere .",
    "remarkably , in this geometrical description a rotation of a spin-@xmath1 state corresponds to a rigid - body rotation of the corresponding points on the sphere .",
    "this property has made the majorana representation a useful tool in many different fields , such as in studying the symmetries of spinor bose - einstein condensates @xcite , in the context of reference frame alignment @xcite , in helping to define so - called anticoherent states @xcite , and in the geometrical description of the states of an @xmath4-level system @xcite .",
    "a variant of the majorana representation was used to study the orbits of @xmath5 in @xcite .",
    "we presented recently a mapping that associates the pure states of an @xmath0-qubit system with a polynomial @xcite .",
    "we showed that it provides a new way of detecting the separability of pure @xmath0-qubit states . in this article",
    "we describe how this method can be used to express pure @xmath0-qubit states geometrically . at the moment",
    "this description works only for pure states ; a generalization to mixed states is not known .",
    "we compare this geometrical description with the majorana one , concentrating on their behaviour in different types of rotations .",
    "we argue that our method is preferable when @xmath0-qubit systems are studied .",
    "our work on the geometrical representations of @xmath0-qubit states is motivated by the usefulness of this type of approach in other contexts @xcite .",
    "in this section we give a short introduction to the majorana representation ; a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be the basis for the spin states of a spin-@xmath1 particle .",
    "an arbitrary pure spin state can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a complex number for each @xmath9 .",
    "this state can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 spin-@xmath3 particles by coupling their spins in such a way that the total spin equals @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the basis of the spin-@xmath3 particle labelled by @xmath10 by @xmath11 , where the superscript m refers to the majorana representation .",
    "the ( uncoupled ) basis vectors of the @xmath2 particle system have the form @xmath12 is either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "we denote the spin operator of the @xmath10th spin-@xmath3 particle by @xmath15 , so the operator for the total spin is @xmath16 the majorana representation uses the eigenstates of @xmath17 related to its largest eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "the eigenvector with maximal projection in the @xmath19-direction corresponds to the state @xmath20 : @xmath21 the expressions for the rest of the spin-@xmath1 states @xmath22 can be obtained from this by acting on it repeatedly with the lowering operator @xmath23 .",
    "the general result is @xcite @xmath24 denotes the sum over all permutations of the @xmath25 -signs . as we show next , the components of the spin-@xmath1 state @xmath26 can be obtained using ( [ sm ] ) if the constituent spin-@xmath3 states are known .",
    "we define @xmath2 spin-@xmath3 states @xmath27 and define a spin-@xmath1 state @xmath28 as a symmetrized tensor product of these states @xmath29 here @xmath30 is an arbitrary non - zero complex number .",
    "a straightforward calculation utilizing ( [ sm ] ) gives @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the sum over all permutations of the indices @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "notice that @xmath33 and @xmath36 are different operations .",
    "this result shows that when the states of the spin-@xmath3 particles are known , the components @xmath37 of the corresponding spin-@xmath1 state @xmath28 can be obtained from equations ( [ xistate ] ) and ( [ cm ] ) . note that changing the normalization and phase of the spin-@xmath3 vectors does not change the physical state , defined as @xmath38 .    in order to obtain the spin-@xmath3 vectors",
    "if @xmath28 is known , we define the _ majorana polynomial _ @xmath39 a straightforward calculation utilizing ( [ xistate ] ) and ( [ cm ] ) shows that @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 which means that the zeros of the majorana polynomial are given by @xmath42 . with the help of these ratios it is possible to construct , up to a normalization and phase , the spin-@xmath3 vectors @xmath43 .    using the roots of the majorana polynomial",
    ", every state @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 points on the bloch sphere .",
    "this is obtained by writing the roots as @xmath45 which defines the locations of the @xmath2 points , given using the angular variables of spherical coordinates .",
    "now @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath47 , which means that if the degree of ( [ mapo2 ] ) is @xmath48 , then @xmath49 of the points are at the south pole .",
    "an important property of the majorana representation is that each state @xmath44 determines a unique point configuration and vice versa .",
    "it can be shown that if the majorana polynomial is defined as in ( [ mapo ] ) a rotation of the vector @xmath26 by a spin rotation matrix @xmath50 corresponds to rotating the point configuration of @xmath26 by @xmath51 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath52 is a rotation and @xmath53 is its irreducible unitary @xmath54- dimensional representation matrix .",
    "these rotations are parameterized by the euler angles @xmath55 , so we can be write @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the spin operators of a spin-@xmath1 particle in @xmath59- and @xmath19-directions , respectively , and we have set @xmath60 .",
    "in this section , we present a way to express the pure states of an @xmath0-qubit system in terms of points on the bloch sphere using the majorana representation .",
    "as the hilbert space of @xmath0 qubits is @xmath61 dimensional , every @xmath0-qubit state can be viewed as a state of a particle with spin @xmath62 .",
    "we denote the basis of qubit @xmath10 by @xmath63 .",
    "note that this basis is different from the one used earlier in the majorana representation , written as @xmath11 .",
    "the basis vectors of an @xmath0-qubit system can be defined as @xmath64 where each @xmath65 and we use the binary notation @xmath66 to label the basis vectors .",
    "the subscript @xmath67 refers to decimal numbers .",
    "these @xmath0-qubit basis vectors can be expressed using the spin states of a spin-@xmath1 particle as @xmath68 is an arbitrary unitary matrix .",
    "let @xmath69 be some vector of the @xmath0-qubit system . using ( [ mapo ] ) and ( [ correspondence ] )",
    "we see that the corresponding majorana polynomial becomes @xmath70 where we have used the fact that @xmath62 .",
    "we choose @xmath71 to be the identity matrix ; hence @xmath72 having fixed the mapping between the spin states and @xmath0-qubit states , we can now obtain a geometrical representation for any pure state @xmath73 by calculating the roots of @xmath74 and using ( [ angles ] ) . as an example , we consider the case @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath76 and the basis states are @xmath77 here the first vector is a basis element of the two - qubit system , the second vector gives it in the basis labelled by decimal numbers , the third vector is the spin vector obtained from ( [ correspondence ] ) , and the rightmost vector gives its majorana representation .",
    "we now consider two states defined as @xmath78 it is easy to verify that @xmath79 is an entangled state while @xmath80 is separable .",
    "the point configurations do not depend on the normalization ; hence these vectors have not been normalized .",
    "the majorana polynomial ( [ majoqubit2 ] ) of @xmath79 reads @xmath81 the roots are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ; hence using ( [ angles ] ) we see that the points are located at @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , respectively ; see figure [ figure](a ) .",
    "the points of @xmath80 can be calculated similarly ; the result is shown in figure [ figure](d ) .",
    "the rotation of @xmath79 and @xmath80 by a spin-@xmath87 rotation matrix @xmath88 moves the points as a rigid body .",
    "this is illustrated by figures [ figure](b ) and [ figure](e ) , where these states have been rotated by @xmath89 .",
    "spin-@xmath87 rotation can be written in terms of spin-@xmath3 rotations as @xmath90 where the right - hand side acts on the rightmost vectors of ( [ v00])-([v11 ] ) , that is , on the spin-@xmath3 vectors of the majorana representation .",
    "this is emphasized by the superscript m. however , when the states of an @xmath0-qubit system are considered , spin-@xmath1 rotations are not of particular interest . instead of these one should concentrate on single - qubit rotations , of which we now show two examples .",
    "we consider an identical simultaneous rotation of the two qubits , so the rotation operator reads @xmath91 in figures [ figure](c ) and [ figure](f ) , we show the states @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , after they have been rotated using @xmath92 .",
    "clearly now the points do not move as a rigid boby but their relative positions change .",
    "in this section , we discuss another geometrical representation of @xmath0-qubit states , based on the polynomial presented in @xcite . as before , @xmath73 is some @xmath0-qubit state expressed in a basis labelled by the decimal numbers @xmath93 we associate this vector with the polynomial @xmath94 the only way to obtain this polynomial from the majorana polynomial describing @xmath0-qubit states , given by ( [ majoqubit ] ) , is to choose @xmath95 .",
    "however , if @xmath96 , this choice means that the matrix @xmath71 is not unitary and the left - hand side and right - hand side of equation ( [ correspondence ] ) can not both be normalized to one .",
    "therefore , there is no unitary map between @xmath0-qubit states and spin-@xmath1 states which would produce @xmath74 from the majorana polynomial @xmath97 for all states @xmath73 .",
    "the benefits of ( [ cp ] ) over the majorana polynomial become clear when one studies the separability of pure @xmath0-qubit states @xcite and the behaviour of the points in single - qubit rotations . in more detail ,",
    "if @xmath98 is a separable @xmath0-qubit state @xmath99 then the corresponding polynomial reads @xmath100 a state @xmath73 is separable if and only if @xmath74 can be written in this form @xcite .",
    "if @xmath101 , ( [ angles ] ) shows that the locations of the points determined by the qubit @xmath10 can be obtained from the equation @xmath102 if @xmath103 , the points are at @xmath104 .",
    "thus , for separable states the points always have a specific configuration .",
    "for example , if @xmath75 , there are three points on the sphere",
    ". one of them can be anywhere while the remaining two are opposite to each other with respect to the @xmath19-axis .",
    "if @xmath105 , seven points are needed , three of which are located as in the two - qubit case .",
    "the rest of the points are at the vertices of a square orthogonal to the @xmath19-axis .",
    "if @xmath106 , there are @xmath107 points on the bloch sphere , seven of them are located as in the three - qubit case while the remaining ones are at the vertices of an octagon orthogonal to the @xmath19-axis . proceeding in this way , one can obtain a general expression for the point configuration of an arbitrary separable @xmath0-qubit pure state .",
    "@xmath108 \\includegraphics[scale=.35]{figure1a.eps } &      \\includegraphics[scale=.35]{figure1b.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale=.35]{figure1c.eps } \\\\ [ 0 cm ] \\multicolumn{1}{l}{\\mbox{(d ) } } &      \\multicolumn{1}{l}{\\mbox{(e ) } } &   \\multicolumn{1}{l}{\\mbox{(f ) } } \\\\ [ 0 cm ] \\includegraphics[scale=.35]{figure1d.eps } &      \\includegraphics[scale=.35]{figure1e.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale=.35]{figure1f.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    the effect of @xmath0-qubit rotations on the point configurations of separable states can be straightforwardly obtained from ( [ thetajm ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath109 the @xmath0-qubit generalization of @xmath110 : @xmath111 a rotation of a separable state @xmath98 corresponds simply to applying @xmath112 to all of the single - qubit states @xmath113 .",
    "the components of the rotated states @xmath114 are @xmath115 which have been obtained using ( [ ds ] ) and the spin matrices of a spin-@xmath3 particle .",
    "the locations of the points can then be obtained using ( [ thetajm ] ) . as an example",
    ", we consider the state @xmath80 .",
    "the polynomial determined by this state is @xmath116 which is clearly of the form ( [ psep ] ) , showing that @xmath80 is a separable state .",
    "this polynomial equals the majorana polynomial of @xmath79 ; hence the point configuration is the same , as can be seen by comparing figures [ figure](a ) and [ figure2](d ) .",
    "a two - qubit rotation of @xmath80 through @xmath117 about the @xmath59-axis corresponds to @xmath118 . in the initial state @xmath119 , hence , using ( [ tildea ] ) , ( [ tildeb ] ) we see that in the rotated state @xmath120 , @xmath121 , so all the points are at the north pole , see figure [ figure2](f ) . in deriving ( [ tildea ] ) , ( [ tildeb ] )",
    "it was assumed that all qubits are rotated by the same single - qubit rotation .",
    "however , it is easy to generalize this treatment to the case where these rotations are not identical .",
    "then the angles in ( [ tildea ] ) , ( [ tildeb ] ) have to be replaced by qubit - dependent angles .",
    "like before , the locations of points can be obtained from ( [ thetajm ] ) .",
    "one should note that this discussion applies only to separable states ; it is not known at the moment how the points corresponding to an entangled @xmath0-qubit state move under these type of rotations .",
    "unlike in the case of the majorana representation , now spin-@xmath87 rotations change the relative locations of the points . for example , a spin-@xmath87 rotation of @xmath80 by @xmath122 moves one of the points to the north pole and shifts the other two points upwards by the same amount , keeping the state separable , see figure [ figure2](e )",
    ". the point configuration corresponding to @xmath79 is presented figure [ figure2](a ) . as in the case of @xmath80 ,",
    "now a spin rotation by a spin-@xmath87 rotation matrix @xmath89 does not correspond to a rigid body rotation of the points , see figure [ figure2](b ) .",
    "interestingly , the final state is separable ; hence this rotation renders the entangled state @xmath79 separable .",

    "in this paper , we have discussed two different geometrical representations of pure @xmath0-qubit states . we have first presented a way to write spin-@xmath1 states in terms of symmetrized states of @xmath2 spin-@xmath3 systems .",
    "we have then shown how this method , known as the majorana representation , can be used to characterize the states of an @xmath0-qubit system and how these states can be given a geometrical representation as points on the bloch sphere .",
    "we have compared this geometrical representation with another one , defined recently by the present authors @xcite .",
    "the majorana representation is well suited for the description of spin-@xmath1 particles as a spin rotation by a spin-@xmath1 rotation matrix corresponds to a rigid body rotation of the point configuration of the state .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath0-qubit systems the interesting operations are not spin-@xmath1 rotations but single qubit ones . we have shown through simple examples that in the latter rotations the points of the majorana representation move in a complex way . furthermore , using the majorana representation it is not easy to see the separability of states from their point configurations .",
    "in contrast to this , in the alternative representation separability can be detected , at least in pricinple , from the point configurations .",
    "additionally , the behaviour of points in single - qubit rotations can be straightforwardly calculated if the rotated state is separable . in conclusion ,",
    "the majorana representation is useful when spin-@xmath1 particles are studied , while the alternative representation is preferable when the states of an @xmath0-qubit system are discussed .",
    "besides helping to visualize @xmath0-qubit states and the way they transform in rotations and other operations , the latter representation may also help to identify some special @xmath0-qubit states , like the majorana representation did in the context of spinor bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
