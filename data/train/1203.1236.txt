    "cold atoms in optical lattices provide a fascinating new class of interacting quantum many - particle systems.@xcite due to the unprecedented precision of experimental techniques in this field it is now possible to simulate and experimentally test theoretical models.@xcite in particular , experiments with bosonic atoms have revived the theoretical interest in the properties of the bosonic hubbard model.@xcite this model describes the quantum mechanical competition between the kinetic energy of lattice bosons , which is responsible for their bose - einstein condensation , and the repulsive interaction , which favors localization of the particles .",

    "a  comprehensive investigation scheme for correlated lattice bosons in the thermodynamic limit has become available , which allows one to calculate also dynamical properties such as spectral functions of the interacting bosons .",
    "the b - dmft is a thermodynamically consistent , non - perturbative many - body approach which is applicable for all values of the input parameters , e.g. , the interaction , density , and temperature .",
    "it leads to a set of nonlinear equations which need to be solved self - consistently .",
    "an exact solution can be found only in special cases , e.g. , for the falicov - kimball model.@xcite in general , the self - consistent equations have to be solved numerically or by employing approximate analytical methods .",
    "the experience with the fermionic dmft  @xcite shows that both numerically exact ( but computationally expensive ) methods _ and _ approximate analytical methods are important to gain insight into the solution of the complicated self - consistency equations .",
    "so far solutions of the b - dmft equations had to be obtained fully numerically . hu and tong,@xcite and hubener , snoek , and hofstetter@xcite employed exact diagonalization ( ed ) , and anders",
    "_ _ et al.__@xcite made use of continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) to solve the b - dmft equations .",
    "analytical or semi - analytical solutions of the b - dmft equations did not exist up to now .",
    "in this paper we present an analytical strong - coupling solution of the b - dmft derived by a linked - cluster expansion ( lce)@xcite around the atomic limit .",
    "the method is analogous to the fermionic strong - coupling solver developed by dai , haule , and kotliar@xcite for the fermionic dmft .",
    "while in the fermionic case the strong - coupling expansion is unable to capture the low temperature fermi liquid physics due to the existence of a characteristic low energy ( kondo ) scale , there is no such limitation in the bosonic case .",
    "our approach differs from previous strong - coupling expansions to the bosonic hubbard model@xcite since they performed the expansion in the hopping amplitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the b - dmft and its self - consistency equations .",
    "then we formulate the linked - cluster expansion and thereby derive a strong - coupling approximation to the b - dmft equations .",
    "this is then applied to the bethe lattice and the cubic lattice , both with coordination number @xmath0 , and to the bethe lattice with @xmath1 .",
    "the phase diagrams of the bosonic hubbard , model calculated in this way are compared with those obtained from numerical solutions of the b - dmft computed with ed @xcite and ct - qmc,@xcite respectively , from numerically exact evaluations on a bethe lattice,@xcite and from numerical results obtained by direct monte carlo simulations of the bosonic hubbard model.@xcite the momentum distribution functions and spectral functions of correlated lattice bosons in the normal and the bose - einstein condensed phase are also calculated .",
    "finally we discuss possible extensions of the approach .",
    "the b - dmft is the bosonic counterpart to the well - established dmft for lattice fermions described by the hubbard model .",
    "its derivation is described in detail in ref .  .",
    "here we focus on a single species of bosons .",
    "the expansion presented below is easily generalized to the case of more than one type of boson .",
    "the bosonic hubbard model is given by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for a boson at a lattice site @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the hopping between lattice sites @xmath5 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the local interaction , and @xmath9 is the number operator of the local occupation . in this paper",
    "we consider nearest - neighbor hopping , i.e. , @xmath10 for the nearest - neighbor sites @xmath5,@xmath7 , and @xmath11 otherwise . in the following we set the boltzmann constant @xmath12 and the lattice spacing @xmath13 equal to unity .      in the b",

    "the dynamical mean field corresponding to bosons in the normal state is represented by the hybridization function @xmath23 the dynamical mean fields @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are determined by the self - consistency equations @xmath27 and @xmath28 here the notation @xmath29 indicates that the thermodynamic average is performed on a lattice with a cavity , i.e. , with one site removed .",

    "is related to the local bec order parameter by @xmath32    the self - consistency loop is closed by introducing the self - energy in the matsubara frequency representation through the @xmath33-integrated dyson equation @xmath34^{-1 } \\label{sc_dyson}\\ ] ] and using the lattice hilbert transform @xmath35^{-1}. \\label{sc_hilbert}\\ ] ] the latter equation links the local green function to the self - energy for a specific lattice described by the non - interacting density of states @xmath36 .",

    "for a bethe lattice with infinite connectivity ( @xmath1 ) @xcite the self - consistency conditions reduce to the simple expressions @xmath41 and @xmath42 in general , e.g. , for a cubic lattice , the self - consistency equations - need to be solved numerically .      in order to solve the impurity problem defined above we use the cumulant ( linked - cluster ) expansion in the dynamical mean fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the action is further divided into two parts @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 the partition function of the impurity problem @xmath48 is thus written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the partition function for the system described by @xmath51 , and @xmath52 denotes the thermodynamic average with respect to the action @xmath51 .",
    "now the exponential function appearing in the average is expanded , leading to an infinite series @xmath53 the series is then re - exponentiated with the help of cumulants ( i.e. , connected @xmath54-particle green functions ) @xcite @xmath55 here the superscript @xmath56 indicates that only the connected part of the averages with respect to @xmath51 is included .",
    "now the partition function can be calculated to the desired order in @xmath57 .",
    "the above approximation is in the spirit of other strong - coupling expansions @xcite and becomes exact in the atomic limit ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , it should be stressed that it is _ not _ an expansion in the hopping amplitude but rather in the dynamical mean fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the fact that these fields are obtained self - consistently implies that all orders of the hopping amplitude contribute.@xcite    in the following we perform the cumulant expansion to second order in @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the partition function @xmath48 .",
    "since the green function is determined by the functional derivative @xmath60 the diagonal element @xmath61 and off - diagonal element @xmath62 are then of first order in @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath63 and @xmath64 furthermore , the local bec order parameter is given by @xmath65    the thermodynamic averages are performed as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "the trace is calculated over the eigenstates of @xmath68 , which are obtained by an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix which is represented in the occupation number basis .",
    "since the local hilbert space of @xmath68 for the bosonic impurity problem is infinite dimensional , the diagonalization has to be performed numerically which , in principle , implies a further approximation .",
    "the hilbert space has to be cut off in the occupation number of the impurity .",
    "the error introduced thereby can be controlled by performing calculations with different values of the cut - off and choosing the smallest cut - off value such that the results do not differ within the required accuracy.@xcite",
