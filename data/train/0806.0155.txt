    "consequently , the combination @xmath157 must leave @xmath97 invariant , and also not contribute a phase to @xmath97 , and hence it belongs to @xmath110 .",
    "but we know that @xmath158 also belongs to @xmath149 , since it consists of two factors each of which is an element of @xmath149 .",
    "so @xmath158 must in fact be one of the two central elements that are common to both @xmath110 and @xmath149 . if @xmath159 , the winding is trivial and there is no string through the triangular face .",
    "if , however , @xmath160 , then there is a string through the triangular plaquette .",
    "+ it can be shown ( see appendix [ consistency ] ) that if the monopole charge ( [ magcharge3 ] ) within the tetrahedron is non - zero , then there must be an odd number of faces with strings passing through , while if it is zero there must be an even number .",

    "if @xmath168 is the total number of string segments , then the relative numbers of segments in closed loops , string segments connecting like charge monopoles , and string segments connecting oppositely charged monopoles , are given by @xmath169 this shows that roughly 4% of @xmath0 monopoles will end up in the doubly charged state and survive annihilation due to strings .",

    "here we discuss qualitatively how a similar analysis in realistic grand unified models would proceed .",
    "our experience with @xmath0 helps us understand and appreciate the difficulties that are likely to be encountered . as an example , consider the minimal grand unified model based on a @xmath14 symmetry group .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath177/{\\mathbb{z}}_3 \\times { \\mathbb{z}}_2.\\ ] ] and , if the non - abelian magnetic charges are confined , the relevant symmetry breakings are @xmath178 the fundamental magnetic monopoles carry @xmath0 and @xmath3 charges in addition to the topological @xmath2 charge .",
    "therefore each monopole will get connected to a @xmath179 string and another @xmath5 string .",

    "for example , the vacuum manifold at the first stage of symmetry breaking is 12 dimensional and it also does not fall into a straightforward category like @xmath181 . determining the distribution of strings is also more complicated since the @xmath0 breaking leads to @xmath179 strings .",
    "these problems do not seem insurmountable but are hard enough that we have not attempted to solve them at the present time .",
    "if very few baryonic clusters form and instead an infinite monopole - string network forms , our experience with string networks @xcite suggests that the network energy density scales with time and never comes to dominate the universe .",
    "processes such as monopole - antimonopole annihilation and meson formation could dissipate the energy of the network at a rate that is determined by the hubble expansion",
    ". however , this scenario ignores the process of baryon formation from the network .",
    "depending on the rate of this process , we could still have a monopole over - abundance problem coming from the production of baryonic clusters .",

    "we demonstrate that the formalism described above respects this condition .    for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to rotate all the relevant quantities to the base point @xmath122 .",
    "in particular , we consider , in place of ( [ w ] ) the quantity @xmath250 where @xmath251 clearly , @xmath252 must be one of the two central elements of @xmath131 , and consequently @xmath253 since the other two factors in ( [ w0face ] ) are in that subgroup .",
    "now consider the product of the @xmath254s from all four faces , say @xmath255 the order of the four factors is arbitrary but has been chosen for later convenience .",
    "this product is evidently again one of the two central elements of @xmath131 ; which one determines whether the number of strings entering the cell is even or odd .",
    "since @xmath256 commutes with all the @xmath257 , when we substitute from ( [ w0face ] ) into ( [ w0 ] ) , we can move all the exponential factors to the right , and so write @xmath254 as a product @xmath258 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ magcharge3 ] ) , and @xmath259 moreover , using eq .",
    "( [ sface ] ) , we see that each factor here may be written as a product of three factors coming from the edges of the triangle , each transported to @xmath122 : @xmath260 where , for example , @xmath261    the key now is to compare the transformations @xmath262 and @xmath263 . by construction",
    ", @xmath264 transforms @xmath108 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 into @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , whereas @xmath270 performs the inverse transformation .",
    "moreover , the prescription for choosing between the two possible transformations is the same in each case .",
    "these two products are therefore inversses .",
    "thus we learn that @xmath271 now when we substitute ( [ s0triple ] ) into ( [ s0 ] ) we find @xmath272 these factors are six pairs of mutual inverses , although since they do not necessarily commute , it is not immediately obvious that they cancel .",
    "it is clear , however , that two pairs cancel at once , leaving us with @xmath273 but now recall that the product of the last three factors is @xmath274 .",
    "consequently , this product commutes with all the @xmath275s , so we may move these three factors together to any desired position in the product . placing them after the first two we find @xmath276 but",
    "now it is clear that we can cancel these pairs successively , so that finally we obtain @xmath277 so this factor may be cancelled from the right side of eq .",
    "( [ w0sq ] ) , which then becomes @xmath278 this shows , as required , that the number of strings is odd or even according as @xmath63 or @xmath279 .",
    "here we discuss monopoles connected by strings in the model @xmath164 the first symmetry breaking is achieved by giving a vev to an @xmath3 adjoint , equivalent to choosing a unit 3-vector ( call it @xmath280 ) .",

    "the second symmetry breaking is achieved by giving a vev to a second @xmath3 adjoint , call it @xmath72 , which is orthogonal to @xmath280 . at this stage",
    "the vacuum manifold is @xmath282 .",
    "therefore monopoles are formed in the first symmetry breaking and these get connected by strings in the second symmetry breaking .    to simulate monopole formation",
    ", we assign unit vectors @xmath280 , equivalently points on @xmath283 , to the points on our spatial lattice @xcite .",
    "a tetrahedral cell gets mapped to a tetrahedron in @xmath283 and some of these mappings will be incontractable , implying the existence of a monopole within the tetrahedral cell .    , labelled @xmath150 , and then determine if the vector in the tangent plane rotates by @xmath284 in circumnavigating the spherical triangle . to do this , we first parallel transport the vector from @xmath127 to @xmath166 along a geodesic , described here as a rotation , @xmath68 .",
    "then we find the rotation @xmath153 within the tangent plane that takes the transported vector into the vector at the vertex @xmath166 . in each case",
    "we choose the minimal - angle rotation .",
    "then we do the same thing for the remaining sides .",
    "since we end up with the same vector at @xmath127 that we started with , the combined transformation is either the identity or a @xmath284 rotation .",
    ", width=211 ]    the formation of strings that connect the monopoles is more involved but easy to picture , as in fig .",

    "this is explained in fig .",
    "[ su2u1scheme ] .",
    "the scheme for @xmath0 is just a generalization of the scheme for the @xmath3 model .",
    "the complications are technical in that , instead of the tangent plane , our `` vectors '' at every vertex lie on an @xmath165 fiber and the geodesics and rotations are harder to determine in practice .",
