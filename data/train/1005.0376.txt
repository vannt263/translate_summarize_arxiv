    "in order to define @xmath208 , for each of finitely many scales , we cover the box @xmath209 with boxes of that certain scale .",
    "boxes of the first scale have extent roughly @xmath210 in direction @xmath82 , and extent marginally larger than @xmath211 in directions orthogonal to @xmath82 . here , @xmath212 is much smaller than @xmath213",

    ". given an environment , we declare a box to be _ good _ if within this box and with respect to the given environment , the quenched random walk behaves very much like the annealed one .",
    "otherwise , it is called _ bad_.    we then define @xmath208 as the event that there are not significantly more than  @xmath215 bad boxes of each scale contained in @xmath209 . using proposition [ prop : closenessbase ] , which states that the probability of a box being bad decays faster than polynomially as a function in @xmath116 , by large deviations for binomially distributed variables one shows that the probability of the complement of this event is smaller than @xmath216 , so that ( [ oneh ] ) is satisfied ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : gprobestimate ] ) .    it remains to show that on @xmath208 , inequality ( [ twoh ] ) is satisfied . for this purpose ,",
    "we associate to the walk a `` current scale '' that slowly increases as the @xmath145-coordinate of the walk increases . we will then require the walk to essentially leave in @xmath145-direction ( i.e. , through their right boundary parts ) all the boxes of its current scale it traverses ; this ensures that it leaves @xmath209 through  @xmath113 . since the probability that the random walk exits a good box through the right boundary part is relatively large",
    ", one can essentially bound the probability of leaving @xmath209 through  @xmath113 from below by the cost the walk incurs when traversing bad boxes .",
    "now each time the walk finds itself in a bad box of its current scale , it will instead move in boxes of smaller scale that contain its current position , and leave these boxes through their right boundary parts . each time this happens",
    ", it has to `` correct '' the errors incurred by moving in such boxes through some deterministic steps , the cost of which will not exceed @xmath217 ; in a certain way , these corrections make the walk look as if it has been leaving a box of its current scale through its right boundary part .",
    "thus , we can roughly bound the probability of leaving @xmath209 through @xmath113 by @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the number of bad boxes that the walk visits . now in order to obtain a useful upper bound for @xmath219 , we can force the random walk to have clt - type fluctuations in directions transversal to  @xmath82 at constant cost in each box ( see _ random direction event _ , section [ subsec : rde ] ) . by means of this random direction event , one can then infer the existence of a  direction ( depending on the environment ) such that , if the clt - type fluctuations of the walk essentially center around this direction , then the walk encounters a  little less than @xmath220 bad boxes of each scale on its way through  @xmath209 . from  ( [ eq : badcosts ] ) , we deduce that the probability for the walker to leave @xmath209 through  @xmath113 can then be bounded from below by @xmath221 .",
