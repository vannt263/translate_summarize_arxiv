    "the earliest quantitative microbiology experiments revealed that microbial population sizes increase exponentially in favorable conditions  @xcite .",
    "similar dynamics are also observed ( to a good approximation ) in the population growth of other species , the spreading of pandemics , the polymerase chain reaction for amplification of dna fragments , global internet traffic increase , multiplication of viruses in t cells , and tumor growth  @xcite .",
    "there are unifying themes in the quantitative characterizations of exponential growth in these different contexts , codified in general results of the theory of branching processes  @xcite . however , the idiosyncrasies of each experimental system determine the important dynamical variables and measurables in that specific context .",
    "for instance , in demographic studies the age structure of the human population in a region at a given time can be well characterized .",
    "however , there is typically a paucity of data for the total population number over multiple human lifespans .",
    "thus indirect estimation of the malthusian parameter ( the exponential growth rate ) from the observed age structures is a focus of these studies  @xcite .    in contrast , in standard bulk - culture bacterial growth studies , the dynamical range in the population number of cells can be readily made to span multiple logarithmic decades in a day or two , since the typical timescales involved are of the order of minutes .",
    "thus precise estimation of the exponential growth rate , @xmath0 , defined to be the inverse of the time taken for the numbers of cells to increase by a factor of @xmath1 , is feasible in this context  @xcite .",
    "since many kinds of cells divide precisely into two cells at each division , the bulk growth rate is often used to infer the cell doubling time , i.e. , the time it takes for a _ single _ cell to fission into two daughter cells , using the formula @xmath2",
    "@xcite . however , the extrapolation from the observed growth rate of the population ( typically involving @xmath3 cells per ml ) to the inferred dynamics at the single - cell level is often inaccurate because all cells do not divide at precisely the same time after birth .",
    "there is significant stochasticity in the division times ( also known as generation times , cell lifetimes , interdivision times , or waiting times)typically the cov ( the coefficient of variation , defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean ) of division times is @xmath4  @xcite",
    ". one must account for this variability in relating the stochastic single - cell division dynamics to the population growth ; even the mean population growth rate depends on the _ shape _ of the division time distribution .",
    "a unique advantage of studying balanced exponential growth in the microbial context is that high quality data are accessible at multiple scales of observation ( sub - cellular , organismal and population level ) . in particular , the technology that we have recently developed for _ c. crescentus _",
    "cells has the advantage that isolated single - cells in highly reproducible and unlimiting balanced - growth conditions can be observed with unprecedented statistical precision  @xcite ; complementary approaches have been introduced by others for other organisms .",
    "thus direct comparison between these single - cell experiments and bulk - culture measurements under the same growth conditions is possible .",
    "here we develop a theory of microbial growth dynamics under balanced growth conditions and demonstrate its use for integrating data from both single - cell and bulk - culture measurements of _ c. crescentus _ cells to make specific predictions at both scales .    a special feature of _ c. crescentus",
    "_ cells is that they divide asymmetrically : a stalked cell grows and divides into two distinct daughter cells : another stalked cell and a swarmer cell , which has to undergo an additional differentiation step before it transitions into a reproduction - capable stalked cell .",
    "the division and differentiation steps are thus controlled by distinct stochastic waiting - time distributions ( see fig .  [ fig - schematic ] ) .",
    "therefore , we generalize the theory to include asymmetric division and derive a prescription for inferring this additional timescale ( swarmer - to - stalked cell transition time ) from the combination of population and single - cell data .",
    "using our results , we examine scalings of all timescales with external parameters that control the balanced growth state .",
    "we combine these results to show how a simple measurement of the population growth rate in a given condition reveals the statistics of stochastic growth and division of individual cells under these conditions .",
    "* system characterization and notation . *",
    "since the number of cells per ml in typical bulk - culture measurements is very large ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) , we can treat the total number of cells in the population at a time @xmath5 , @xmath6 , as a continuous variable .",
    "moreover , it is reasonable to assume that the fluctuations in @xmath6 relative to its mean value are negligible . in asymptotic balanced growth , @xmath6",
    "is expected to grow exponentially , i.e. , @xmath7 .    here",
    ", @xmath0 denotes the exponential growth rate of population size ; it can be experimentally obtained from standard bulk - culture measurements .",
    "we denote the age of the cell , i.e. , the time since the last division , by @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the probability that a cell lives to age @xmath8 and then divide between ages @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the division _ propensity _",
    ", @xmath11 , is defined as follows : @xmath12 is the probability that a given cell of age @xmath8 divides between @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "one might be tempted to equate it to @xmath14 , but the two are distinct and related as follows : @xmath15}$ ] ( see si for details ) .",
    "we note that in balanced growth , the division time distribution , @xmath14 , is independent of the time of observation , @xmath5 .    in microbial systems ,",
    "the number of progeny per cell is typically a constant number ( a positive integer , such as 1 or 2 ) ; we denote it by @xmath16 .",
    "we define the age - dependent number density , @xmath17 , as follows : @xmath18 is the number of cells present at @xmath5 , with ages between @xmath8 and @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we consider growth conditions in which the probability of cell - mortality is negligible .",
    "thus the total number of cells ( and so the number of cells of each age ) increases indefinitely .",
    "mathematically , being in balanced growth state means that the _ fraction _ of cells of each age at any time , @xmath5 , is time invariant .",
    "therefore , the cell - age distribution , @xmath20 , is time - independent in the long time ( balanced growth ) limit .",
    "we denote this steady - state age distribution by @xmath21 .",
    "it is a normalized probability density since the sum of fractions of cells at each age is unity . in practice ,",
    "single - cell measurements yield @xmath14 , from which the division propensity , @xmath11 , can be computed ( see above ) .",
    "thus , the question then becomes how , given @xmath14 and @xmath16 , the corresponding population exponential growth rate , @xmath0 , and the age distribution , @xmath21 , are to be self - consistently determined .",
    "* general solution for symmetric cell - division . *",
    "to place the general solution in context , it is useful to first consider two familiar limiting cases of the problem .",
    "( i ) in the _ deterministic _ limit , cells divide exactly at age @xmath22 , i.e , @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 . here ,",
    "when @xmath25 , the doubling time is equal to the division time , @xmath22 .",
    "( ii ) when the the dynamics are _ markovian _ or memoryless , the division time distribution is an exponential , @xmath26 .",
    "the dynamics in this case are identical to those of a one - step stochastic hinshelwood cycle  @xcite , or equivalently , an age - dependent galton - watson process with an exponential waiting - time distribution  @xcite .",
    "the full solution is known ; in particular , @xmath27 .",
    "thus the population growth rate , @xmath0 , is equal to the single - cell exponential waiting time distribution parameter , @xmath28 .",
    "note that even for this simple case , the mean division time of single cells , @xmath29 , is not equal to the mean doubling time of the population , @xmath30 .    in general , the propensity of a cell to divide depends on its age , i.e. , @xmath31 varies with @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , the time evolution is non - markovian , and @xmath14 is non - exponential .",
    "this significantly increases the complexity of the problem of finding the population growth rate , @xmath0 , as a functional of @xmath14 ; for symmetric division , the process falls in the category of a bellman - harris branching process  @xcite . typically , the division time distribution is a unimodal distribution with a positive skew , i.e. , it has a long right tail and is thus qualitatively different from the monotonically decreasing exponential distribution ( markovian limit ) . therefore solving",
    "the general non - markovian case is important .",
    "we derive the time evolution equations for the age - dependent number density , @xmath17 , and the age distribution , @xmath32 , for a general @xmath14 and solve them exactly ( see * methods * and si ) .    in the general case , the population s exponential growth rate , @xmath0 , is related to the single - cell division time distribution , @xmath14 , through the integral @xmath33 in words , @xmath0 is the point at which the laplace transform of the division time distribution , @xmath14 , is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "the expressions for the age distribution and the total population number , for a given initial condition , @xmath35 , are @xmath36 ; { \\nonumber}\\\\ & { n}(t ) = { n}(0)\\ , e^{k \\ , t } ; { \\nonumber}\\\\ & n(t , { \\tau } ) \\equiv { n}(t)\\,g^{*}({\\tau } ) = { n}(0 ) \\frac { { \\nu}k } { ( { \\nu}-1)}\\ , e^ { -{\\left } [ \\int_{0}^{{\\tau } } d{\\tau } ' { \\alpha}({\\tau}'){\\right}]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together , eqs .   and",
    "constitute the complete analytical solution to the problem for symmetric cell division .    from the general solution it follows that there is a unique steady - state age distribution , @xmath21 , corresponding to a given division time distribution , @xmath14 , and progeny number , @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , if the ( population ) cell - age distribution and the bulk exponential growth rate are observed , eq .   can be used to infer the _ single - cell _ division time distribution !",
    "we note that the growth rate , @xmath0 , is itself a functional of @xmath14 for a given @xmath16 , and is thus not an independent parameter of the solution for @xmath21 in eq .  .    since the shape of the age distribution reveals features of the division time distribution , its qualitative features are of interest",
    "briefly , they are as follows .",
    "( see fig .",
    "s1 for a graphical summary of these results . )",
    "first , the age distribution monotonically decreases with @xmath8 . to see this",
    ", note that in eq .",
    ", the cumulative integral @xmath37 increases with @xmath8 since @xmath38 .",
    "next , since @xmath39 , the most probable division time is determined by where the curvature of @xmath40 changes sign , i.e. , its point of inflection .",
    "also note that the slope of this function at its point of inflection estimates the width of the division time distribution . for @xmath41 , a case considered in detail below",
    ", the mean division time is given by the point of inflection of the age distribution and the slope at this point estimates the width of the division time distribution .",
    "finally , for a given @xmath14 , a greater value of @xmath16 ( number of progeny per cell ) will increase the growth rate and skew the age distribution towards smaller ages ( i.e. , to the left ) .    * comparison with single - cell experiments : measured and predicted cell - age distributions .",
    "* we compare our theory to recent single - cell data for _ c.  crescentus _ @xcite .",
    "_ c.  crescentus _ divides into two morphologically and functionally distinct daughter cells : an adherent stalked cell that is replication competent and a motile swarmer cell that can not divide further but can differentiate into a stalked cell . in these microfluidic experiments @xcite ,",
    "stalked cells are retained and swarmer cells are removed after each division ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic ] and si for more information ) .",
    "therefore the stalked - cell dynamics ( in these experimental conditions ) are equivalent to cells being simply `` renewed '' after each division , i.e. , @xmath42 . also , the total number of stalked cells in the experiment , @xmath6 , is constant .",
    "these features simplify the problem , and we can use the analytical results for the symmetric - division model .",
    "however , the growth dynamics are still non - markovian and hence non - trivial . for @xmath42",
    "the relation between the division time and age distributions becomes @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the mean division time , @xmath45 .",
    "see si for details and fig .",
    "s1 for a graphical interpretation .",
    "we use the measured time - courses of single - cell growth and division to validate the theory as follows .",
    "we obtain the _ measured _ cell - age distribution by building a histogram of the duration between the time of observation and the recorded time of the previous division for each cell . from the same experiment",
    ", we also measure the division time distribution , and we insert it into eq .   to compute the _ predicted _ age - distribution . for experiments spanning the physiological temperature range of the organism , we find excellent agreement between the measured and predicted cell - age distributions with no fitting parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig - age - dist]a ) , confirming the model .",
    "when rescaled by their condition - specific means , cell - age distributions from all temperatures collapse onto a single curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig - age - dist]b symbols ) .",
    "the underlying physical principle encoded in this universal behavior is that a single temperature - dependent scale of time , proportional to the mean division time ( or equivalently , the mean age ) , governs stochastic growth and division dynamics @xcite . for the scaling collapse of the corresponding mean - rescaled division time distributions",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "we note that the mean age , @xmath46 , and mean division time , @xmath47 , are not equal . for @xmath42 , using eq .  ,",
    "the two are related by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the cov of the @xmath14 distribution .",
    "using eqs .   and , we find the predicted mean - rescaled age distribution ; this also agrees excellently with the observed distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig - age - dist]b line ) .",
    ".   shows that when there is no stochasticity in division times ( i.e. , the deterministic case @xmath50 ) , then the mean age is half the mean division time since cell age is uniformly distributed from @xmath51 to @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , this provides a lower bound for the mean age ( for a specified mean division time ) since any stochasticity in @xmath14 can only increase @xmath49 , and thus the mean age .",
    "we note that in practice , even if there is sizable noise in division times , the second term is negligible compared to the first ( for @xmath52 noise in division times , the ratio of the two terms is @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath54 .",
    "once the age distribution ( for a specific balanced growth condition ) has been determined , it can be used to deconvolve cell - cycle phase dependence from a population of asynchronous cells , since it predicts the probability weight to associate with cells of each age .",
    "this obviates the need for less precise bulk - synchronization experiments , in which it is also unclear how the synchronization procedure may itself alter the balanced growth state .",
    "for instance , if the initial population has only swarmer cells , then the numbers of stalked and swarmer cells in the population oscillate with time and the culture is far from being in balanced growth ( fig .",
    "[ fig - num ] ) .",
    "we note that an early empirical algorithm for cell - cycle phase deconvolution was given in  @xcite .",
    "* generalization to asymmetric division . * motivated in part by the _ c.  crescentus _ data discussed above , we now generalize the theory to allow for asymmetric divisions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic ] ) .",
    "there are two distinct cell types in the population : normal division - capable cells , and reproductively quiescent cells which take an additional stochastic waiting time , @xmath55 , to differentiate ( transition ) to normal cells before being able to divide .",
    "each normal cell divides into @xmath16 normal cells and @xmath56 quiescent cells .",
    "the waiting time @xmath57 has probability distribution @xmath58 .",
    "normal cells divide with a division time distribution , @xmath14 , as before . with the inclusion of asymmetric division ,",
    "the process is no longer a standard branching process , since different cells in the population are not statistically identical  @xcite .",
    "this significantly increases the complexity of the problem .",
    "however , we have found exact analytical solutions ( see * methods * and si ) .",
    "we denote the ( steady - state ) age distributions of normal and quiescent cells by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . in the @xmath61",
    "limit the problem becomes equivalent to the symmetric division case .",
    "a key physical insight is that the ratio of normal to quiescent cells should be a constant for balanced growth conditions .",
    "consequently , both kinds of cells must increase exponentially in numbers , with the _ same _ growth rate , @xmath0 .",
    "see * methods * and si for details .",
    "the exact solution for @xmath0 , for specified functional forms of @xmath14 and @xmath58 , when @xmath16 normal and @xmath56 quiescent progeny are born at each division , is @xmath62 in this solution @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for the complete solution , including expressions for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and the fixed ratio of stalked to swarmer cells , see si .",
    "* comparison with population level experiments : scaling of timescales in the _ c. crescentus _ lifecycle . * for _ c. crescentus _ cells , the `` normal '' cell stage corresponds to stalked cells , and `` quiescent '' cells are identified with swarmer cells .",
    "each stalked cell divides into a stalked cell and a swarmer cell .",
    "the swarmer differentiates into a stalked cell after a time , @xmath55 .",
    "thus , for bulk - culture experiments with _ c. crescentus _ cells , @xmath65 , and eq .   becomes @xmath66 from our bulk - culture experiments , we are able to determine the population growth rate , @xmath0 ( see * methods * for details ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 is also known , since it is directly observed in our single - cell experiments .",
    "thus , the timescale that remains to be determined is the swarmer - to - stalked cell transition time , @xmath55 , and the corresponding distribution , @xmath58 .",
    "there are several technical reasons why direct experimental characterization of @xmath55 is challenging ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "yet knowledge of this timescale could provide an important clue to many fundamental biological questions .",
    "for example , it is not known precisely what fraction of the _ c. crescentus _ lifecycle is spent in the swarmer stage . determining this may in turn",
    "indicate how the additional differentiation step in the lifecycle confers flexibility to the fitness of _ c. crescentus _ cells in different growth conditions .",
    "also , results in  @xcite imply that there must be cell size growth at the swarmer stage , since the average size of a newborn swarmer is only @xmath67 of the average size of a newborn stalked cell , and the newborn stalked cell size distribution has been shown to be invariant . but whether swarmer cell sizes increase linearly , exponentially , or in a rapid growth spurt during differentiation , remains to be determined .    here",
    "we estimate the swarmer - to - stalked transition time for different balanced growth conditions using eq .  .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - timescales ] . at each growth condition , we invert the ( integral ) equation to estimate @xmath55 , using the experimentally determined @xmath0 ( the bulk growth rate ) and @xmath14 ( the stalked cell division time distribution ) .",
    "the mean value of this timescale , @xmath68 , is insensitive to the particular functional form assumed for @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath69 and find @xmath70 using eq .  , after numerically evaluating the laplace transform for @xmath14 at @xmath0 for each growth condition .",
    "remarkably , the _ fraction _ of the cell cycle spent in the swarmer stage is a constant , as temperature is varied ( and the duration of the lifecycle itself changes by a factor of @xmath71 ) .",
    "specifically , we find that @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - timescales ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with indirect measurements in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , using this ratio , we can predict the ratio of swarmer to stalked cells in the population during balanced growth ( see si for details ) .",
    "we find that @xmath74 , also consistent with previous estimates  @xcite , further validating our approach .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the _ single - cell _ exponential growth rate ( of stalked cell sizes ) , @xmath75 , determines a condition - specific cellular unit of time .",
    "thus , it governs all aspects of the stochastic dynamics of stalked - cell growth and division ; in particular , its inverse is proportional to the mean division time , @xmath47 , and it also determines the full distribution , @xmath14 .",
    "since we now find that @xmath76 is also a constant , the implication is that the single - cell exponential growth time scale , @xmath77 , proportional to the population growth rate , @xmath0 , governs all relevant timescales for growth , division _ and differentiation_. thus _ all _ timescales rescale proportionally , when external conditions are changed ( see fig .  [ fig - timescales ] ) .",
    "the remarkable implication is that for any balanced growth condition of interest , a simple measurement of the population growth rate , @xmath0 , when used to rescale the universal mean - rescaled distributions we have found ( fig .  [ fig - age - dist ] and @xcite ) , together with the model , yields distributions of cell - division times , cell ages , and cell sizes .",
    "moreover , we find that the population and single - cell exponential growth rates are approximately equal to each other for all temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig - timescales ] : @xmath78 .",
    "the surprising implication of this observation is that the duration of the swarmer - to - stalked cell transition time is accounted for by the fact that cell numbers _",
    "double _ in the time that cell sizes increase by a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "this observation is consistent with swarmer cell sizes also increasing exponentially with time , with the same growth rate .",
    "however , this interpretation is speculative at this time .    * numerical simulations : scaling of fluctuations in population numbers . * to extend the results to transient population growth dynamics ( before the balanced growth state is attained ) , to examine fluctuations in population numbers , and to confirm the analytical predictions , we performed stochastic simulations for population growth for different waiting - time distributions and progeny numbers .",
    "we developed an exact algorithm for simulating these non - markovian population growth dynamics ( see si for details ) .",
    "we note that the standard gillespie algorithm  @xcite can not be used , since it assumes exponential waiting - time distributions .",
    "our simulation results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig - num ] .",
    "interestingly , in the transient phase , the numbers of normal ( stalked ) and quiescent ( swarmer ) cells oscillate with time .",
    "thus the ratio of population numbers of swarmers to stalked cells also oscillates before reaching the analytically predicted steady - state value .",
    "the mean - rescaled distributions of numbers of swarmer and stalked cells undergo a striking scaling collapse , similar to the one observed for the stochastic hinshelwood cycle model  @xcite , suggesting that this scaling collpase is a universal signature of coupled stochastic exponential growth .",
    "in summary , we have related single - cell division to population growth , by introducing an analytical framework that takes dynamics at both scales into account . we have validated this framework by matching predicted and observed age distributions for _ c. crescentus _ cells in balanced growth at different conditions .",
    "we have also used this framework to show how timescales characterizing these dynamics scale with external conditions ( different temperatures ) , and shown that a single timescale governs all aspects of these dynamics .    in this work",
    "we have identified the cell age distribution , @xmath80 , as an important `` order parameter '' for describing the non - equilibrium steady - state of cells in balanced growth conditions . the analytical framework introduced here",
    "could also provide a starting point for examining transient responses to changes in external conditions in different contexts : for instance , following a temperature change , a nutritional shift or a chemical perturbation to molecular regulators of cell cycle progression .",
    "evidently , the _ functional _ change of the age - distribution characterizes the transient dynamics following the perturbation . in future work",
    ", we will explore these transient responses by extending the approach introduced here .",
    "here we briefly indicate how we wrote down and solved the time evolution equations for the age distribution and the age - dependent number density . for the symmetric case ,",
    "consider the fraction of cells between ages @xmath8 and @xmath81 at a time , @xmath5 : @xmath82 .",
    "after a small interval of time @xmath83 elapses , the fraction of cells in each age interval changes due to two distinct processes , aging and division .",
    "newborn cells always appear at @xmath84 .",
    "accounting for these probabilities gives the time evolution equation for the age distribution . for asymmetric division , there are three distinct processes that evolve the stalked and swarmer cell age distributions : aging , division and differentiation . in analogy with the symmetric case , we write the coupled time evolution equations for the age distributions of the normal and quiescent cells .",

    "( 1 ) for each cell present , we probabilistically generate the time ( from the provided waiting distributions ) at which that cell will either divide or change state , if that has not yet been determined . ( 2 ) we then choose the most immediate event and perform it on the associated cell .",
    "if the cell divides , we replace it with two new cells ; if the cell changes state , we modify its corresponding attribute . ( 3 ) we then update the current time and repeat until the desired time or population is reached . as the simulation progresses , we successively record any desired statistics , including population size and cell ages .    by explicitly identifying the time of the next cell event ( step 2 ) ,",
    "we ensure that our simulations progress in natural time order",
    ". since cells are statistically independent , an alternative viable strategy would be to simply process cell events in an arbitrary order until all cells reach the desired simulation end time .",
    "while maintaining a natural ordering increases the computational cost of simulation by a factor @xmath161 , we believe it has a few advantages . with this configuration , we can condition individual runs on first - passage type statistics and naturally accommodate interactions between cells in future applications .",
