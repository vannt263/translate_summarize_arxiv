    "current astrophysical observations indicate that our universe has entered a phase of accelerated expansion in the recent past.@xmath0 the accelerated expansion has been attributed to the existence of mysterious dark energy with negative pressure .",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite experiment tells us that the usual baryonic matter , dark matter and dark energy occupy about 4% , 23% and 73% of the total energy of the universe , respectively . at present , candidates for dark energy have been widely studied . with the exclusion of the cosmological constant @xmath1 ,",
    "most dark energy modelling using scalar field has followed the quintessence@xmath2 paradigm of a slowly rolling canonical scalar field .",
    "however , there has been increasing interest in loosening the assumption of a canonical kinetic term . in its most general form , this idea is known as k - essence.@xmath3 a more specific choice is the tachyon,@xmath4 which can be viewed as a special case of k - essence models with dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action.@xmath5 this kind of scalar field is motivated by string theory as the negative - mass mode of the open string perturbative spectrum .",
    "sen@xmath4 showed that the decay of d - branes produces a pressureless gas with finite energy density that resembles classical dust .",
    "a rolling tachyon has an interesting equation of state whose parameter smoothly interpolates between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this has led to flurry of attempts being made to construct viable candidate for the inflaton at high energy .",
    "meanwhile the tachyon can also act as a source of dark energy depending on the form of tachyon potential .",
    "tachyon dark energy has been explored by many authors , for example refs [ 8,9,10 ] .",
    "one of these studies is to investigate whether there are any distinctive signatures of non - canonical actions available to be probed by observations .",
    "since there are more and more models proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration , it is very desirable to find a way to discriminate between the various contenders in a model independent manner . in ref",
    "[ 11 ] , sahni et al proposed a cosmological diagnostic pair @xmath8 called statefinder , which is defined as @xmath9 to differentiate among different forms of dark energy . here",
    "@xmath10 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "the statefinder is a geometrical diagnostic that it depends on the scalar factor @xmath11 . since different cosmological models involving dark energy exhibit qualitatively different evolution trajectories in the @xmath12 plane , this statefinder diagnostic can differentiate these dark energy models .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the statefinder parameters for the tachyon field dark energy model .",
    "it is found that the evolving trajectories of this model are different from other dark energy models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we specify the form of tachyonic potential and obtain the autonomous equations of tachyon dark energy model . in sec .",
    "3 , it is analyzed to the evolving trajectories of this model in the statefinder parameter plane .",
    "section 4 is our conclusions .",
    "the evolution equations for a flat frw cosmological model filled with a tachyon field t and a barotropic perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath13 are @xmath14 which are subject to the friedmann equation @xmath15 where dots denote differentiation with respect to cosmic time @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the density @xmath18 and pressure @xmath19 of tachyon field are given by , then @xmath20    we introduce the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath21 thus the fractional densities of the two fluids are defined as , respectively @xmath22    consider the inverse square potential@xmath23 @xmath24 now . we can cast the evolution equations in the following autonomous form : @xmath25,\\\\ \\frac{dz}{dn}&=&3z(z-1)(\\gamma - x^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the number of e - folds @xmath26 and the constant @xmath27 . from the definitions of these new variables ,",
    "we obtain the equation @xmath28 of state of tachyon field @xmath29",
    "in order to discriminate between different forms of dark energy , sahni et al@xmath30 proposed a geometrical diagnostic method  statefinder papameter . since different cosmological models involving dark energy exhibit qualitatively different evolution trajectories in the @xmath12 plane , this statefinder diagnostic can differentiate various kinds of dark energy models . by far some models , including the cosmological constant , quintessence , phantom , quintom , the chaplygin gas , holographic models , interacting and coupling dark energy models@xmath31 have been successfully differentiated . for example , the statefinder parameters correspond to a fixed point @xmath32 for the spatially flat lcdm cosmological model which is a good fit for the observation@xmath33 , the quintessence model with inverse power law potential , the phantom model with power law potential and the chaplygin gas model all tend to approach the lcdm fixed point , but for quintessence and phantom models the trajectories lie in the regions @xmath34 while for chaplygin gas model the trajectories lie in the regions @xmath35 . in this paper",
    ", we apply the statefinder diagnostic to the tachyon field model . to begin with ,",
    "statefinder parameters ( [ eq : statefinder ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 which @xmath37 , and the deceleration parameter is also given @xmath38    in the following we will discuss the statefinder for the attractor solutions in ref [ 13 ] : tachyon dominated solution and tracking solution .",
    "firstly , we discuss the attractor solution @xmath39 at @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , which is an asymptotically stable mode and corresponds to tachyon dominated solutions for @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "nextly , there exists another attractor solution q at @xmath44 . when @xmath45 , @xmath46 is always asymptotically stable and corresponds to the tracking solution . in ref",
    "[ 13 ] the constant @xmath47 , we can obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 . with the condition of the above attractor solutions , we consider the constants @xmath50 for the tachyon dominant solution and @xmath51 for the tracking solution . in addition , the two special values @xmath52 and 1 are also studied . in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 we show the time evolution of the statefinder parameter pairs @xmath8 and @xmath53 . the plot is for variable interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "we see clearly that the curves pass through the lcdm fixed point @xmath55 . and",
    "the evolving trajectories lie in the total region , which is different from other quintessence and phantom models . in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 we plot the evolution trajectories of the statefinder parameters versus @xmath56 diagram of the stable attractor solutions .",
    "it is noted that @xmath57 causes the deviation between statefinder parameters and lcdm scenario . in the figure of @xmath58 , the curve for @xmath52 approaches to lcdm scenario after @xmath59 , while for other cases the distance from the curves to lcdm scenario becomes large with the decreasing of @xmath57 . in the figure of @xmath60",
    ", the constant @xmath57 also causes the deviation between the curves and lcdm scenario . in fig .",
    "5 the equation of state for the tachyon field has been shown .",
    "the equations of state for @xmath52 and @xmath51 tend to @xmath6 and @xmath61 after oscillations , respectively , while for the other two cases @xmath28 would violate the basic condition @xmath62 , which can not lead to the acceleration .",
