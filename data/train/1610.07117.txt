    "triangle singularities were discussed by landau @xcite , and affect physical processes driven by a feynman diagram with three intermediate states .",
    "the triangle singularities appear in a particular situation , where all intermediate states are placed on shell , and the particles move along the same direction .",
    "even then , the singularities appear in a situation in which a classical analogy can be established where an original particle a decays into two particles 1 and 2 , the particle 1 decays into an external particle b and the internal particle 3 , and finally the particles 2 and 3 merge into an external particle c. the classical situation requires that particle 3 moves along the same direction and faster than particle 2 to catch up for the delay in its production .",
    "this is the essence of coleman norton theorem when applied to a triangle diagram  @xcite .",
    "a simple analytical formula to impose these conditions is given in ref .",

    "in ref .  @xcite the interaction of vector mesons with the octet of baryons was studied .",
    "the interaction was found attractive in many cases to the point that some baryonic states emerged as molecular states due to this interaction .",

    "@xmath224  mev and beyond , the cross sections with this simplified model grow up but stabilize around 0.8 @xmath220b .",
    "however this is a regime that we are not interested in , which definitely would need improvements , but what matters for our purpose is that the contribution of the triangle singularity becomes negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcs_ff ] , we conduct another fit , introducing now the form factor in the @xmath13- and @xmath3-exchanges .",
    "the fit gives us now @xmath226 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 . the contribution of the @xmath13-exchange is now smaller and is compensated by a larger contribution of @xmath3 , still moderate .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath224  mev band is now better than before , and for higher energies , the cross section stabilizes around 0.6 @xmath220b . yet , the most important point is that the strength of the triangle singularity needed in the fit is the same as before , with the coefficient @xmath226 .",
    "we have conducted other fits , one of them includes fitting the data in the band of @xmath224  mev .",
    "one gets a better agreement at higher energies at the expense of a somewhat worse agreement in the band of @xmath230  mev .",
    "another fit is done assuming a smaller width for the @xmath90 , of the order of 200  mev .",
    "the important outcome from all these fits is that the strength of the triangle singularity needed remains the same .",
    "all these results confirm the relevance of the triangle mechanism with a strength compatible with the calculated one within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "we have performed a study of the contribution of a triangle diagram to the @xmath36 reaction .",
    "the mechanism consists of the formation of the resonance @xmath90 , predicted theoretically within the local hidden gauge approach to vector - baryon interaction , and supported by results of @xmath235 done at the @xmath236 and @xmath94 thresholds .",
    "this resonance couples strongly to @xmath94 and produces a singularity via the triangle mechanism where the @xmath90 decays into @xmath94 , the @xmath3 decays to @xmath237 and the @xmath39 merge to form the @xmath6 .",
    "the peak of the singularity shows up around @xmath35  mev and the mechanism also has its largest strength around @xmath238 .",
    "this is precisely the region of energies and the angles where conventional models failed to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "we have shown that adding a few basic mechanisms to the triangle one , and with a strength for this latter mechanism compatible with theoretical uncertainties , we find a good agreement for @xmath9 and the integrated cross section around the experimental peak at @xmath35  mev .",
    "the stability of the results for the strength of the triangle diagram , for different options fitting the data , gives us confidence to claim that the triangle singularity studied in this paper is the missing ingredient that has prevented a good reproduction of the data around this energy by different theoretical approaches so far .",
    "we would like to thank r. schumacher for useful comments and for pointing us some details on the data .",
