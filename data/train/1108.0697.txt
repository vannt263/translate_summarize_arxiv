    "magnetars are a rare class of neutron stars which are characterised by a very strong surface magnetic field , typically 10@xmath3 ",
    "10@xmath4 g @xcite , and relatively slow spin rate ( p @xmath52  12 s ) when compared to the majority of observed pulsars .",
    "they also differ from normal pulsars in that they are not powered by their spin - down energy losses but by the decay of energy stored in their magnetic field @xcite .",
    "magnetars are historically divided into two classes : anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) which are characterised by slow pulsations and rapid spin - down , and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) which exhibit sporadic bursts of hard x - ray / soft gamma rays .",
    "while originally considered to be unrelated , it is now accepted that axps and sgrs are the same type of object @xcite .",
    "there are currently 16 confirmed magnetars ( 7 sgrs and 9 axps ) and a further 7 candidates ( 4 sgrs and 3 axps ) . due to this small sample size",
    "it is difficult to determine the average lifetime , spatial distribution , duty cycle and luminosity of the population as a whole",
    ". however , all the galactic magnetars lie very close to the galactic plane , consistent with young ( @xmath610,000 yrs ) neutron stars with low spatial velocities ( @xmath6500 km s@xmath7 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the exceptions are the two magnetars located in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "while there have been reports of the detection of sgrs in m 31 @xcite and m81 @xcite , these sources have been detected only once and their sgr nature has thus yet to be verified .    in this paper",
    "we present an in - depth analysis of multi - wavelength data on the x - ray source 2xmmi j003833.3 + 402133  ( hereafter , referred to as xmm j0038 + 40 ) , which was observed during a survey of the nearby galaxy m 31 .",
    "@xcite identified this object ( source 57 in their sample ) as a probable black hole low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) located within m 31 . here",
    "we argue that the x - ray spectral and timing properties of this source are also consistent with xmm j0038 + 40  being a new addition to the rare class of galactic magnetars .",
    "if this conclusion is correct , the high galactic latitude of xmm j0038 + 40  would make it unique as the other galactic magnetars are all located within the plane .",
    "the field of xmm j0038 + 40  was observed by _ xmm - newton _  on 2008 january 2 for 45.5 ks by the three epic cameras ( pn , mos1 and mos2 ) as part of a survey of the local group galaxy m 31 @xcite .",
    "source detection performed by the _ xmm - newton _  processing pipeline detected a bright uncatalogued source at an off - axis angle of 7.72@xmath8 .",
    "the source position is ra = 00h3833.32 , dec = + 402133.20@xmath9 ( j2000 ) with a 3@xmath0 positional uncertainty radius of 1@xmath9 ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the source detection procedure ) .",
    "no data were available from the two reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ) as xmm j0038 + 40  fell outside their fields of view .",
    "the science analysis system ( sas ) version 10.0 software was used to process the observation data files ( odfs ) using the same procedure as outlined by @xcite .",
    "background light curves extracted from the entire field at energies @xmath10 10 kev found no evidence for flaring , and so no good time interval filtering was applied .",
    "we extracted source spectra using circular regions centred on the source position with radii of 71.5  and 41.5  for the pn and mos cameras , respectively .",
    "background spectra were extracted from nearby source - free regions of the field with areas 1.5 times the source extraction region areas .",
    "response and ancillary response files were produced for the spectra and the light curves were corrected using the sas task _",
    "epiclccorr_. the spectra were grouped at 20 counts per bin to provide sufficient statistics for @xmath11 fitting and analysed using xspec v12.6.0q @xcite .",
    "data below 0.2 kev and above 7 kev ( where the statistics are very poor ) were ignored for the spectral fitting .",
    "@xcite fitted spectra extracted from their 2008 _ xmm - newton _  observation with three models : absorbed disk blackbody plus power law , absorbed disk blackbody , and absorbed bremsstrahlung models .",
    "they found that the disk blackbody plus power law model was the best fitting model obtaining @xmath11/dof = 174/145 , although they also claim formally acceptable fits using the two other models ( with @xmath11/dof = 270/147 and 209/147 for the simple disk blackbody and bremsstrahlung models , respectively ) .",
    "we fitted the spectra we extracted from the 2008 _ xmm - newton _  observation with the same models and obtained similar results for the disk blackbody plus power law and the simple disk blackbody models , although we argue that due to the high quality of the data the fit with the simple disk blackbody model is unacceptable with a @xmath11/dof = 812/714 .",
    "we therefore only report the results of the disk blackbody plus power law fit in table [ bhxrb ] .",
    "in contrast , our fit with the absorbed bremsstrahlung model obtained a much better fit ( @xmath11/dof = 764/714 , see table [ specpar ] ) with a significantly lower temperature of kt = 0.98 @xmath12 0.02 kev than the kt = 1.91 @xmath12 0.07 kev obtained by @xcite .",
    "the cause of the differences between our fitting and that reported by @xcite is unclear .",
    "we also fitted the spectra with a more physical model representing emission from an accreting black hole , i.e. an absorbed disk blackbody plus thermal comptonisation model ( comptt in xspec ) , with the input soft photon ( wien ) temperature fixed to the disk blackbody temperature .",
    "again , we obtained an acceptable fit with @xmath11/dof = 746/711 ( see table [ bhxrb ] ) .",
    "in addition to the model fits reported by @xcite , we attempted to fit the 2008 _ xmm - newton _  spectra with power law , blackbody ( the bbodyrad model in xspec ) , and thermal plasma ( the mekal model in xspec ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) models . in each case",
    "photoelectric absorption was accounted for using the phabs component in xspec and the wilms abundances @xcite .",
    "neither the simple power law model nor blackbody models provided an acceptable fit , with @xmath11/dof = 1205/719 and 1165/719 , respectively , and significant residuals appearing below 2 kev . adding a low temperature blackbody component to the power law model improved the fit significantly ( @xmath11/dof = 806/712 ) , although with a very steep power law photon index ( see table [ specpar ] ) .",
    "the addition of a second blackbody component to the simple absorbed blackbody model produced a better fit ( @xmath11/dof = 752/712 ) and completely smoothed out the low energy residuals ( see table [ specpar ] ) .",
    "attempts to fit the spectra with an absorbed mekal model with the abundance parameter frozen at solar values did not provide an acceptable fit ( @xmath11/dof = 11527/719 ) . allowing the abundance to vary freely improved the fit significantly ( @xmath11/dof = 769/718 ) , however the abundance value fell to zero indicating that no significant line emission is present and therefore the model is consistent with the underlying bremsstrahlung continuum model . in summary",
    ", we obtained acceptable fits with the double blackbody , blackbody plus power law , disk blackbody plus power law , disk blackbody plus thermal comptonisation , and bremsstrahlung models but are able to rule out the simple blackbody , simple power law , and thermal plasma ( with non - zero elemental abundances ) models .",
    "the best fits were obtained with the disk blackbody plus thermal comptonisation and the double blackbody models , which are shown in figures [ dbbplmod ] and [ specbb ] .      to search for pulsations in the _ xmm - newton _  data",
    ", we extracted counts in the energy range 0.2  12  kev using the same extraction regions as used for the spectra .",
    "this resulted in 8078 , 7192 and 23740 counts for the mos1 , mos2 and pn cameras , respectively . in each case",
    ", we corrected the photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter . to search for high frequency periodic variability we performed a @xmath13 ( rayleigh ) test to search for sinusoidal pulsations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the mos1 and mos2 data , we searched for pulse periods in the range 6.4 to 4500  s , while for pn data we considered periods between 146  ms and 4500  s. we saw no significant power at any period , either in each data set separately or in a period search of all three data sets combined .",
    "the corresponding 5@xmath0 upper limit on the pulsed fraction is 7% in the period range 146  ms to 6.4  s , and 5.5% in the period range 6.4 to 4500  s.    we also extracted power density spectra ( pds ) over the reliable energy bandpass ( 0.3 - 6  kev ) binned on 10 s. we find that , with linear binning , the variability is consistent with the statistical white noise within 1@xmath0 using the most accurate bayesian least - squares fitting routines @xcite . as the shape of the pds is energy dependent and we could conceivably have a stable , bright component diluting the variability when averaged across the entire bandpass , we also extracted the energy dependent fractional excess variance ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we did this initially for the bands which correspond to the absorbed disk blackbody plus thermal comptonisation spectral model ( 0.3  0.8 and 0.8  6kev ; see figure [ dbbplmod ] ) with binning on 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 400 s to test for variability typically seen from black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "we could not constrain any variability over any timescales in either energy band above the white noise level , obtaining a 3@xmath0 upper limit of 8@xmath14 on the fractional variability using the method of @xcite .",
    "this is the theoretical upper limit for what we should be able to detect given teh bandpass , count rate , and exposure time .",
    "as this relies on our spectral deconvolution being an accurate description of the data we also tested energy bands within these two bands ( specifically 0.3  0.5 , 0.5  1 , 1  2 and 2  6 kev ) on 400 s binning ( to ensure adequate statistics in these smaller energy bands ) and find no constrained variance above the statistical white noise .",

    "xmm j0038 + 40  fell within the field of view of the optical monitor ( om ) during all three _ xmm - newton _  observations , which observed the field in imaging mode with the _ uvw1 _ and _ uvm2 _ uv filters .",

    "less sensitive observations at 0.3 and 1.4  ghz at other epochs also show no radio source at this position @xcite .",

    "it is also inconsistent with cvs which typically have f@xmath56/f@xmath60 @xmath61 0.1 @xcite .",
    "high levels of dust extinction could explain the lack of an optical counterpart , however the position of xmm j0038 + 40  @xmath522@xmath54 out of the galactic plane puts it in a region of low dust extinction with e(b - v ) = 0.062 mag @xcite .",

    "if xmm j0038 + 40  is located within or behind m 31 there may be an additional contribution from the galaxy disk .",
    "however , the low n@xmath15 values from the x - ray spectral fitting indicate that m 31 is unlikely to be a major contributor to the extinction .",
    "we thus conclude that the high flux ratio is not due to dust reddening .",
    "the lack of a point - like radio counterpart above 1.5 mjy is not very constraining .",
    "for example , using the black hole fundamental plane relationship between x - ray luminosity , radio luminosity , and black hole mass , we would not expect to be able to detect radio emission from an agn unless it was closer than 1.5 mpc ( assuming a black hole mass of 10@xmath63 m@xmath64 ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "at such a distance the galaxy itself should be easily resolved in the optical / nir images . likewise , radio emission from the jet of a 20 m@xmath64 black hole x - ray binary would not be detectable unless the system was closer than 20 pc , a distance at which emission from the disk or donor star would surely be detectable in our deep optical images .",
    "the epic x - ray spectra are consistent with blackbody plus steep power law , double blackbody , disk blackbody plus power law , disk blackbody plus thermal comptonisation , or thermal bremsstrahlung models ( all with the addition of a photoelectric absorption component of low column density , consistent with the galactic latitude of the source ) .",
    "the temperature of the bremsstrahlung model was 0.98 kev , much lower than the lowest temperature measured for a cv ( kt = 1.9 kev from thermal plasma fits to _ xmm - newton _  spectra of the quiescent dwarf nova gw lib ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , line emis- sion becomes more significant relative to the un- derlying continuum spectrum for cvs with low temperature spectra .",
    "hence , if xmm j0038 + 40 was a cv it would be expected that the spectrum would be consistent with a thermal plasma model with non - zero elemental abundances .",
    "the spectrum of xmm j0038 + 40  is not consistent with such a model , adding further weight to the argument against it being a cv .",
    "spectra of accreting black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries are typically modelled by a power law ( representing inverse compton emission ) , sometimes with the addition of a soft thermal component attributed either to emission from the surface ( in the case of a neutron star ) or the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observationally it can be difficult to discriminate between black hole and neutron stars in x - ray binaries unless the compact object undergoes behaviour such as thermonuclear bursts or spin period pulsations that are definitively identified with neutron stars .",
    "however , a clear separation between neutron star and black hole x - ray binaries has been found empirically in the _ xmm - newton _ hardness ratios , particularly evident in the medium and hard x - ray bands ( farrell et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "this separation was previously noted by @xcite in _ rxte _ data and attributed to the presence of a surface in neutron stars and an event horizon in black holes . when compared with a sample of neutron star and black hole x - ray binaries drawn from the 2xmm catalogue the hardness ratios of xmm j0038 + 40",
    "place it in the parameter space populated by black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "the only neutron star systems that have spectra as soft are the rare class of quiescent neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "the spectra of these objects are dominated by thermal emission from the surface or atmosphere of the neutron star ( with a faint compton tail ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which is inconsistent with the spectral fitting of xmm j0038 + 40  ( see table [ specpar ] ) .",
    "we now consider the possibility that xmm j0038 + 40  is a black hole x - ray binary .",
    "the temperature derived for the disk blackbody components when fitting the epic spectra with the disk blackbody plus power law model ( see table [ bhxrb ] ) is significantly less than that generally seen in black hole binary spectra when the disk is inferred to be at the inner stable circular orbit ( isco ; see the reviews of e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a low temperature is most consistent with black hole binaries that are not in the disk dominated spectral state but are instead transitioning to the low / hard state where the disk does not extend to the isco .",
    "if the disk is truncated at the lowest mass accretion rates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then the temperature of this component should be lower and the spectrum should be appended by a strong , hard tail of emission @xcite .",
    "this tail is accompanied by large amounts of variability on all timescales ( although this variability itself may originate in the disk : see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , inconsistent with the absence of variability in the epic light curves of xmm j0038 + 40 .",
    "while such low disk temperatures are most often seen in conjunction with variability , there are cases where it is not .",

    "alternatively , if xmm j0038 + 40  is located within our own galaxy , its luminosity would be @xmath6 4 @xmath41 10@xmath67 erg s@xmath7 ( assuming a distance @xmath6 15 kpc ) , far too low for a black hole x - ray binary in the high / soft state and therefore favouring a location within m 31 .",

    "all the known m 31 x - ray binaries and candidates are either located in globular clusters or within the dusty star forming rings @xcite .",
    "in contrast , xmm j0038 + 40  is not coincident with a globular cluster and is found well outside the star forming ring ( see figure [ xrbfig ] ) , indicating that it must have been ejected from its birth location .",
    "the angular distance from xmm j0038 + 40  to the nearest star forming ring is @xmath58.5 , implying a minimum distance of @xmath52 kpc at the distance of m 31 .",

    "m image of m 31 with the distribution of star forming regions ( blue circles ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plus x - ray binaries and candidates from the xmm lp - total catalogue ( red diamonds ; * ? ? ?",

    "all the x - ray binaries are located within the dusty star forming rings of m 31 except for xmm j0038 + 40  ( purple square ) , which is distinctly removed from any nearby regions of star formation . ]",
    "we now consider the possibility that xmm j0038 + 40  could be a magnetar .",
    "the x - ray spectra of magnetars have been historically fitted with a two component model comprised of a steep power law plus a blackbody ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite argue that this model is not physically justified and favour the fitting of a double blackbody model .",
    "they emphasize this is more physically feasible as the pulse modulation of the magnetar can be understood in terms of anisotropic heat conduction and radiative transfer in the strong magnetic field .",
    "the epic spectra of xmm j0038 + 40  are consistent with both the blackbody plus steep power law and the double blackbody models , with the spectral parameters falling well within the range spanned by sgrs and axps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of slow pulsations in the light curve of xmm j0038 + 40  ( one of the defining characteristics of magnetars ) does not weigh against the magnetar hypothesis , as pulsed fractions below the upper limit of 7@xmath14 derived for xmm j0038 + 40  have been observed from other magnetars ( e.g. the axp 4u 0142 + 614 has been observed with a pulsed fraction as low as @xmath55@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetars typically have very faint or no counterparts in nir and optical wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the deep limits we have obtained for xmm j0038 + 40 . in particular , using the unabsorbed x - ray flux and the 2mass k@xmath55 band magnitude limit , the x - ray to nir flux ratio for xmm j0038 + 40  is f@xmath56/f@xmath68 @xmath10 37 , which is consistent with the flux ratios of the known magnetars ( see e.g. figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray variability by a factor of @xmath52 450 observed from xmm j0038 + 40  is of the same order as seen from other magnetars ( e.g. xte j1810197 , cxou j164710.2455216 , and ax j1845.00258 ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) but slightly higher than the most extreme example ( ax j1845.00258 with a variability factor of 260  430 ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the x - ray spectrum , transient behaviour , and high f@xmath56/f@xmath60 ratio are all consistent with the known sample of magnetars .",
    "apart from the two magnetars located in the magellanic clouds , all the other members of this class have been found very close to the plane of our own galaxy .",
    "in contrast , xmm j0038 + 40  is coincident with the outer edges of the nearby galaxy m 31 .",
    "the 0.2  10 kev x - ray luminosity of xmm j0038 + 40  at the distance of m 31 is @xmath69 erg s@xmath7 , about 3 orders of magnitude higher than typically seen from magnetars following an outburst @xcite .",
    "in addition , if xmm j0038 + 40  is located in m 31 , the radius of the blackbody emitting radii derived from the normalization of the bbodyrad components are 554 km and 126 km for the double blackbody model and 162 km for the blackbody plus power law model .",
    "these radii are far greater than the maximum radius of a neutron star . when taken in conjunction with the unusually high luminosity , we conclude that xmm j0038 + 40  is unlikely to be a magnetar located within m 31 , and (",
    "if it is a magnetar ) is most likely to be galactic .",
    "if xmm j0038 + 40  is @xmath6 10,000 yr old with a spatial velocity @xmath6 500 km s@xmath7 , assuming it was born in a supernova explosion from a massive star in the galactic plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then it could only have travelled @xmath55 pc directly out of the plane .",
    "the galactic latitude of b @xmath522@xmath54 therefore implies a line - of - sight distance of @xmath513 pc , making xmm j0038 + 40  an improbably nearby magnetar .",
    "furthermore , the derived luminosity at such a distance is only @xmath70 erg s@xmath7 , significantly lower than typically observed from magnetars . if the luminosity of xmm j0038 + 40  is between 10@xmath71 ",
    "10@xmath72 erg s@xmath7 like the other magnetars , this implies a distance of between @xmath50.7  21 kpc from earth and therefore a distance of @xmath50.3  8 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "this then implies either an implausibly high spatial velocity @xmath10 10,000 km s@xmath7 ( for an age @xmath6 10,000 yr ) or an age @xmath73 yr ( for a spatial velocity @xmath6 500 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "such an age is inconsistent with that derived for magnetars .",
    "however , sgr - like behaviour has been observed from a source ( sgr 0418 + 5729 ) located at a moderate galactic latitude ( b = + 5.1@xmath54 ) .",
    "pulsations with a period of @xmath59.1 s have been detected from sgr 0418 + 5729 but with a very small period derivative of p @xmath74 s s@xmath7 , implying a surface dipolar magnetic field strength of @xmath75 g and a characteristic age of @xmath76 yr @xcite .",
    "thus , if the progenitor of xmm j0038 + 40  was a massive star that went supernova within the galactic plane , it is possible that it is an old magnetar where the magnetic field strength has decayed to @xmath77 g.    alternatively , the high galactic latitude of xmm j0038 + 40  could be explained by the progenitor being a massive runaway star that originated in a binary system that became unbound , and then travelled outside the plane of the galaxy prior to going supernova .",
    "runaway o and b - type stars have been observed in our galaxy with space velocities up to @xmath5100 km s@xmath7 @xcite . assuming a similar space velocity , the progenitor of xmm j0038 + 40  would have taken @xmath78 yr to travel @xmath50.3  8 kpc out of the galactic plane ( assuming a velocity vector perpendicular to the plane ) .",
    "these timescales are perfectly consistent with the nuclear burning lifetimes of massive stars with masses between @xmath58  30 m@xmath64 with lifetimes between @xmath79 yr @xcite .    in order to discriminate between a black hole x - ray binary and a magnetar",
    ", we need to either detect spectral state transitions ( that are the signature of black hole binaries ) or pulsations ( that are a signature of magnetars ) .",
    "if the pulsations are detected , the measurement of the spin derivative would then allow us to derive both the surface dipole magnetic field strength and the characteristic age of the neutron star , discriminating between the two possibilities we describe above for the nature of the magnetar .",
    "further deep x - ray observations triggered based on regular monitoring of xmm j0038 + 40  are thus required .",
