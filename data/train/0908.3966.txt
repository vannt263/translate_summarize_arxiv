    "in recent years , there has been significant progress in the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite study of self - localized states in vertical cavity surface - emitting lasers ( vcsels ) subject to frequency selective external optical feedback ( fsf ) .",
    "these systems are attractive from an experimental point of view because they can be implemented with basically off - the - shelf optical components , and they do not require an optical holding beam to support self - localized solutions , also known in this context as cavity solitons ( css ) .",
    "these systems are known as cavity soliton lasers , because for certain parameter regions laser emission takes place only in localized structures .",
    "an important property of this system is its invariance under phase transformations .",
    "hence each cs is a member of a continuous family of phase - equivalent localized structures .",
    "further , for the same parameters there may be several families of css with different frequencies .",
    "in contrast , localized structures in driven - cavity systems are phase- and frequency - locked to the holding beam .",
    "there are many possible applications of css @xcite , but we will emphasize here only the most relevant one for the contents of this article , namely an optical delay line or shift register .",
    "this element is essential in communication systems for delaying pulses when routing several sequences of bits .",
    "this function was proposed to be implemented on the basis of spatially drifting css @xcite , where the drift of css was caused by a gradient of the system parameters .",
    "thus , one can inject a sequence of pulses at one transverse position , and read out a copy of this sequence at another position at some later time ( delay time of the shift register ) .",
    "in contrast with gradient - induced cs motion , the possibility of self - motion was shown in a holding beam system @xcite with thermal effects .",
    "spontaneous motion of vortices in lasers and laser amplifiers with saturable absorption has been also studied in @xcite . in a previous work @xcite",
    "we have shown the existence of 2d self - propelled css in a vcsel with fsf , even without thermal effects .",
    "this is an alternative mechanism to induce motion in delay lines .",
    "since no parameter gradient has to be imposed and controlled , there is , in principle , no limit to the drift distance , and hence delay time of the shift register . since css moving in the transverse direction can be reflected by the boundaries of the device @xcite the delay line can be folded , enabling longer paths for a given vcsel aperture , and therefore improving the delay - bandwidth product .    in this article",
    "we analyze in detail the bifurcation diagram of self - moving solitons elucidating the conditions for the appearance of motion in the 1d case . in comparison with @xcite here",
    "we address the role of the feedback phase , which plays an important role in determining the longitudinal - mode frequency of the cs . for a given feedback phase several cs solutions with different frequencies ( associated to adjacent external cavity modes )",
    "are found to coexist .",
    "for each solution , sweeping the feedback phase allows to change continously the frequency of the cs . applying a @xmath1 sweep in the feedback phase shows a smooth transition from one cs solution branch to the adjacent one .",
    "the number of coexisting solutions increases with the delay time .",
    "we also investigate the role of the carrier dynamics , which was neglected in @xcite , and analyze its influence on the stability of css .",
    "in particular we show the existence of a _ swinging _ instability in which the position of the cs maximum starts to perform growing oscillations near the initial position .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_model ] we discuss the system and the models considered . in section [ sec_soliton ] we describe the properties of self - propelled css and formulate the equations for their semianalytical calculation using a newton method . in this section",
    "we present also the bifurcation diagrams of moving and resting solitons explaining their connection with the stability properties of the nonlasing background solution and discussing the relation between the 1d and the 2d problems . in section [ sec_phase ]",
    "we study the possibilities of controlling the solitonic states by varying the feedback phase and show the co - existence of multiple states , both moving and resting . in section [ sec_carriers ]",
    "we study the influence of the carrier dynamics , leading to the swinging instability and to the stabilization of resting solitons .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we give some concluding remarks .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the set - up sketched in fig .  [ scheme ] ) , where light is fed back to the vcsel after being filtered in frequency .",
    "the polarizer allows feedback only for the linearly polarized field component that is dominant in the solitary laser , so that the field can be treated as a scalar .",
    "the dynamics of the complex envelope of the electrical field @xmath2 , the filtered feedback field @xmath3 and the carrier number @xmath4 can be described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the decay rate of the field in the cavity ; @xmath7 is the linewidth enhancement factor describing phase - amplitude coupling ; @xmath8 is the pump current normalized to be @xmath9 at the threshold of the solitary laser ; @xmath10 describes diffraction and @xmath11 is the carrier relaxation rate .",
    "the filter is considered to have a lorentzian frequency response @xcite , and its central frequency is taken as reference hence @xmath12 the frequency of the axial mode of the solitary laser at threshold ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the other filter parameters are @xmath14 , the feedback strength , @xmath15 the feedback phase , @xmath16 the delay time in the feedback loop , and @xmath17 the filter bandwidth .",
    "eliminating the carriers adiabatically model ( [ modeleqsn ] ) reduces to @xmath18 for a fixed feedback phase @xmath19 this was the model considered in @xcite .",
    "we will use this simplified model in sect .",
    "[ sec_soliton ] to determine the bifurcation diagrams of moving and resting solitons as well as in sect .",
    "[ sec_phase ] to discuss the role of the feedback phase .",
    "while the simplified model allows for easier calculation , the typical relaxation times of the system are in fact @xmath20 ns , @xmath21 ns and @xmath22 ( throughout this paper time is measured in nanoseconds ) . since the carrier density is the slowest variable , adiabatic elimination of the carriers is not fully justified",
    "nevertheless , as discussed in sect .  [ sec_carriers ] where we address the influence of the carrier dynamics by considering the full model ( [ modeleqsn ] ) , the reduced model correctly predicts the existence of moving and resting stable css , albeit with slight changes in the parameter regions where they are observed .",
    "we consider in this section the simplified model ( [ modeleqs ] ) for feedback phase @xmath19 , as in @xcite .",
    "[ fgtransv2 ] shows the marginal stability curves for the trivial solution @xmath23 .",
    "this solution is stable for small pump values ( below line d in the figure ) . at @xmath24",
    "it becomes unstable to perturbations with the frequency of the filter maximum and with a finite transverse wavenumber . for values of the pump between lines d and b the formation of a complex spatiotemporal regime is observed . for pump values in between line",
    "b and the thick line at @xmath25 the trivial solution is stable again . in this region , which we will call _ gap - region _ , we observe the spontaneous formation of self - localized states , both resting css and self - propelled css @xcite . in the 1d case , we observe the formation of self - propelled css for almost all the values of the pump in the gap - region whereas in the 2d case this region splits in 3 subregions : a ) close to b , where moving 2d css are excited , b ) intermediate values , where resting 2d css are observed , and , c ) values closer to 1 , where no solitons can be excited @xcite .",
    "the system is invariant under translational and global phase transformations , and thus the operations @xmath26 and @xmath27 transform solutions in solutions .",
    "so there is a whole family of css which have the same distribution of the far field absolute value @xmath28 .",
    "the members of the family are identified by two continuous parameters , their location and global phase . moving solutions break the left - right symmetry of the system so that two equivalent families of self - propelled css exist , one with a positive @xmath29 moving to the left and its specular image with negative @xmath29 and moving to the right .",

    "[ fig_1dshape ] .",
    "the near field is characterized by an exponential spatial localization .",
    "the far field shows a typical cascade of energy from small to large wavenumbers due to nonlinearity .",
    "the far field is centered off - axis ( at @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig_1dshape ] ) and is asymmetric : we note that the part of the far field to the right of the maximum is smoother than the left part .",
    "self - propelled css move at a constant velocity , which is proportional to @xmath32 .     and @xmath30 . , width=302 ]    the residual level at @xmath33 , both in the near and far fields , is indicative of the numerical precision .",
    "the spatial profile of the soliton shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1dshape ] has been obtained from numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ modeleqs ] ) where the initial condition breaks the left - right degeneracy . as for the numerical integration",
    ", we should note that accurate results are difficult to obtain using usual finite difference methods , because large @xmath34 transverse wave vectors lead to the presence of very high frequencies , and hence they require very small temporal steps .",
    "for the numerical integration we have used the two - step pseudo - spectral method described in the appendix of @xcite , where in fourier space the linear part of the equations is handled analytically , thus avoiding the problem with the high frequencies associated to high wavenumbers due to diffraction .",
    "nonlinear terms are evaluated in real space .",
    "the pseudo - spectral method can be easily adapted to equations with delay such as the ones considered here .",
    "we have taken the temporal stepsize much smaller than all the characteristic times of the system and we have verified that the selected stepsize allows to reproduce correctly the threshold of the background instability predicted by the linear stability analysis , and the threshold of the drifting instability obtained by the newton method described below .",
    "one of the main objectives of this work is , however , to compute the whole branch of self - propelled states , including the region where they are unstable , hence we need to implement a newton method , similar to what was done for resting 2d solitons in @xcite , for moving solutions .",
    "we will seek solutions of the form : @xmath35 substituting ( [ movsolutions ] ) into ( [ modeleqs ] ) we have the following equations : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the spatial coordinate in the moving reference frame . in fourier space",
    "@xmath38 the set of differential equations ( [ eqs_moving_newton ] ) is transformed into a set of algebraic equations .",
    "the second equation is linear and can be solved directly @xmath39 leading to a single equation for the field @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 equation ( [ eq_one ] ) is analogous to the eq .",
    "( 3 ) of @xcite for stationary solutions , while it also supports more complex solutions , like self - propelled css . in practice",
    "( [ eq_one ] ) is solved numerically by discretizing @xmath43 in @xmath44 values which leads to a set of @xmath45 coupled equations .",
    "there are @xmath46 unknowns [ @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 and two constraints associated to the translational and global phase invariance .",
    "this set can be solved using a newton method starting from an initial guess prepared by direct integration of ( [ modeleqs ] ) . at each newton iteration , imposing that in the moving frame the location of the cs does not change allows for the determination of @xmath49 . similarly imposing that the global phase does not change allows for the determination of @xmath51 .",
    "equivalent solutions can be obtained by applying a translation or a global phase change .",
    "the specular family of self - propelled css can be obtained just by reflection .",
    "furthermore , once a precise solution for a given set of parameters is obtained , it is possible to build the full branch of 1d self - propelled css for different parameter values using continuation methods .",

    "[ fig - space2 ] for @xmath55 .",
    "the real part of the field performs many oscillations within a hwhm of a sech - like envelope .",
    "the fact that the width diverges while the oscillation wavevector remains finite ( corresponding to the critical wavenumber of the zero solution ) does not allow to follow the branch close to bifurcation point just by rescaling the spatial length scale .",
    "it requires increasing of number of discretization points ( 2048 points were used in our 1d calculations ) .",
    "as might be expected , it can be proved analytically that in this limit the moving cs is an envelope soliton of the critical traveling - wave solution , and moves with its group velocity .",
    "the moving - cs branch in fig .  [ fgtransv2 ] ) defines only existence , and says nothing about stability .",
    "it is clear that the entire section of the branch below line b must correspond to unstable cs , because of instability of the zero - amplitude background state . above line",

    "@xmath55.,width=302 ]    it is worthwhile to emphasize that the motion of localized states is connected with the modulational instability of the background leading to travelling waves with a finite critical transverse wavevector .",
    "this suggests a way of eliminating the drifting instability of resting solitons by removing the finite wavelength instability .",
    "this can be done by varying the detuning @xmath56 , which shifts the critical transverse wavevector along the @xmath34 axis ( see @xcite ) . if instead we want to enhance the self - propelled solitons ( increase the velocity ) we need , then , to increase the critical wavenumber . increasing the pump , the value of @xmath57 and the associated value of @xmath58 , decrease ( see fig .  [ fgtransv2 ] and fig .",

    "the drift is associated to an asymetric cross - section along the the direction of motion while the section in the orthogonal ( transverse ) direction is symmetric .",
