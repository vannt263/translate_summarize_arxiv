    "recent years have seen an exponential annual increase in mobile data traffic@xcite .",
    "content dissemination and offloading , where a portion of data traffic is offloaded from cellular networks to high - capacity and low - cost complementary networks , including wifi , vehicular and device - to - device networks , to ease the burden of cellular networks , becomes an increasingly important and challenging task @xcite .",
    "in addition to complementary networks , the mobility of users can also be exploited to assist the content dissemination . when users carry mobile devices physically while walking around university campus , shopping centres or travelling by taxis , buses or private vehicles , the content in their mobile devices also move with them without consuming any bandwidth .",
    "together with device - to - device communication technologies such as vehicle - to - vehicle communications , mobility of users offers an alternative way to transport delay - tolerant content efficiently and cost effectively  @xcite .",
    "a large proportion of the content delivered over mobile networks is delay - tolerant content , like videos , newspapers , weather reports and vehicular info - entertainment .",
    "for these types of content , content offloading reduces the traffic load of cellular networks ( and boosts the capacity of cellular networks in the sense that more users can be served ) and also provides a higher data rate for the users .",
    "the expense is that content offloading will incur higher delay compared with direct transmission using cellular networks .",
    "this paper proposes a novel cooperative content dissemination and offloading strategy for a heterogeneous network consisting of different types of devices with different levels of mobility , ranging from static wifi access points ( aps ) to mobile devices such as vehicles , to reduce the traffic load of cellular networks while guaranteeing the successful delivery of content .",
    "the strategy is particularly suited for the delivery of delay tolerant content .",
    "more specifically , the following contributions are made in the paper :    1 .",
    "a cooperative content dissemination strategy is proposed , which exploits all three data dissemination methods , i.e. cellular networks , complementary networks and device mobility , to disseminate content ; 2 .",
    "erasure codes , to be introduced in section [ section_system_model ] , are employed to further reduce the data traffic load ; 3 .",
    "analytical results are presented to stochastically characterise the content dissemination process , taking into account the heterogeneity in the devices , in terms of mobility and transmission capability . in particular , the reduction in the amount of data traffic in cellular networks is calculated ; 4 .   based on the above results ,",
    "optimal parameter settings of the content dissemination strategy are discussed , which minimise the data traffic load of the cellular network while guaranteeing the successful delivery of all content .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows : section  [ section_related_work ] reviews related work .",
    "section  [ section_system_model ] introduces the system model , including the content dissemination strategy .",
    "section  [ section_analysis ] presents the analysis of the content dissemination process , whose optimal design is studied in section [ section_optimization ] .",
    "section  [ section_simulation ] validates the analysis using simulations .",
    "finally section  [ section_conclusion ] concludes this paper and discusses possible future work .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review of the work most related to this paper .",
    "recent research @xcite has shown that wifi networks have already carried and offloaded a large amount of mobile data traffic .",
    "when a device enters into a wifi covered area , it can switch its data traffic from cellular networks to wifi networks @xcite to reduce the traffic load of cellular networks .",
    "a major issue in wifi offloading is the optimum deployment of wifi aps .",
    "bulut et al .",
    "@xcite compared different methods of deploying wifi aps for efficient offloading of mobile data traffic .",
    "they also proposed a greedy approach that can achieve a high offloading efficiency .",
    "in addition to using wifi aps , recent technology has also allowed mobile devices to become a virtual wifi access points ( a.k.a .",
    "wifi tethering ) , so that devices can communicate with one another via ad hoc connections without relying on infrastructure .",
    "in this way , devices can _ cooperate _ with one another to disseminate content .    using a typical cooperative content dissemination strategy @xcite , the service providers first deliver the content to only a small group of users ,",
    "then these users can further disseminate the content to other subscribed users when their mobile devices are in the proximity and can communicate using wifi tethering or bluetooth technology .",
    "it is obvious that such opportunistic content dissemination can not guarantee the delivery of content .",
    "this paper proposes a mechanism that can provide guarantee on the delivery of content .",
    "furthermore , some work in cooperative mobile data offloading ( e.g. @xcite ) investigated the design and selection of helpers , viz . some special mobile devices selected to help the content provider to deliver messages to other mobile devices using ad hoc connections .",
    "as vehicular networks form an important class of mobile networks , there is significant research on content dissemination in vehicular networks @xcite .",
    "wireless access through vehicle - to - roadside communications can be used in public transport vehicles for streaming applications , e.g. , videos and interactive advertisements .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , it is challenging to develop an efficient wireless access scheme that minimises the cost of wireless connectivity for downloading data .",
    "there are also some empirical studies on content dissemination methods for vehicular networks @xcite .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "these @xmath0 nodes can be classified into @xmath1 types according to their mobility , e.g. static wifi aps , mobile devices carried by pedestrians and vehicles , and social characteristics , e.g. students in the same class .",
    "let @xmath2 be the number of nodes of the @xmath3 type : @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that at some initial time instant @xmath5 , the @xmath0 nodes are independently , randomly and uniformly distributed on a torus @xmath6 ^ 2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "it follows that the nodes density in this network is @xmath7 .",
    "then these nodes start to move independently according to some mobility models@xcite .",
    "we assume that the nodes mobility is such that the spatial distribution of nodes is stationary and ergodic with stationary uniform distribution on the torus .",
    "as shown in @xcite , a number of mobility models have this property .",
    "the use of a toroidal rather than planar region as a tool in analysing network properties is well known .",
    "the use of torus allows nodes located near the boundary to have the same number of connections probabilistically as a node located near the centre .",
    "therefore the consideration of a torus implies that there is no need to consider special cases occurring near the boundary of the region .",
    "this often simplifies the analysis without obscuring the relationship between main performance - impacting parameters .",
    "we consider two types of wireless networks : the cellular network and the complementary network .",
    "it is assumed that every node is directly connected to at least one cellular base station ( bs ) at any time . in the complementary network ,",
    "devices communicate with one another via ad hoc connections using device - to - device communication technologies such as bluetooth , wifi or dsrc @xcite .",
    "these ad hoc connections are usually of high capacity , and can be exploited by mobile devices to cooperatively share content of common interest .    due to the limited communication range",
    ", the ad hoc connection between two nodes only emerges opportunistically when they move close to each other . considering a commonly used model , called the _ unit disk connection model _ ( udm ) , two nodes",
    "are directly connected iff their euclidean distance is not larger than the radio range @xmath8 . adopting this commonly used connection model",
    ", we say that two nodes _ meet _ each other when they move into the radio range of each other .",
    "consequently define the _ inter - meeting time _ of two nodes as the time interval between two consecutive meetings of two nodes ( a more rigorous definition is given later in section [ section_inter_meeting ] ) .",
    "there have been a number of studies on the distribution of the inter - meeting time .",
    "in particular , cai and eun @xcite analytically proved that for two nodes moving in a finite area ( with reflective or wrapping boundary ) under random waypoint or random walk mobility models , their inter - meeting time has an exponential distribution , whereas the inter - meeting time of nodes moving in an infinite area follows a power - law distribution .",
    "this paper also considers that the inter - meeting time follows an exponential distribution .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper however is directly applicable to other inter - meeting time distributions as shown in section [ section_inter_meeting ] .",
    "this subsection describes the cooperative content dissemination and offloading strategy .",
    "consider that a content provider has @xmath9 messages to deliver to the @xmath0 nodes .",
    "the content dissemination process has three phases : initial phase , sharing phase and complement phase .    1 .   initially at time @xmath5 , the cellular bss transmit @xmath10 packets to @xmath10 different nodes via cellular networks .",
    "note that the content in these packets depends on the coding scheme to be described in section [ section_coding_scheme ] .",
    "then the network enters into the _ sharing phase _",
    ", where the nodes broadcast their received packets via ad hoc connections using the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemic scheme , to be described in section [ section_sir ] .",
    "3 .   at time @xmath11",
    "( called deadline ) , the sharing phase stops and then the network enters into the _ complement phase _ , where every node requests the remaining packets required to decode all @xmath9 messages from bss , where the _ remaining packets _ required to decode the messages are determined by the coding scheme .    the main objective of the content dissemination strategy is to minimise the total number of packets requiring to be transmitted through cellular networks , which include the packets transmitted in the initial phase and in the complement phase , while guaranteeing the successful delivery of the content .",
    "we consider the use of a simple erasure coding scheme .",
    "specifically , the @xmath9 messages are encoded into @xmath10 _ coded packets _ @xcite .",
    "we assume that the galois field @xcite used in the encoding process is large enough so that the content provider can generate @xmath10 linear - independently coded packets .",
    "it follows that each node needs to acquire @xmath9 _ distinct _ coded packets to reconstruct all the @xmath9 messages .    consequently , if a node receives @xmath12 distinct coded packets by the end of the sharing phase , then it needs to request @xmath13 coded packets in the complement phase via cellular networks in order to decode all @xmath9 messages .    for benchmarking",
    ", we also consider the case that no coding technique is employed . in this case , the bss transmit @xmath14 copes of the @xmath15 message in the first phase for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "then each node needs to receive at least one copy of each message .      in the sharing phase ,",
    "the @xmath10 packets are shared among @xmath0 nodes using a susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemic sharing scheme .    without loss of generality , consider the epidemic sharing of an arbitrary packet , say packet @xmath18",
    ". using a classic sir broadcast scheme , a node in the network can be in any of the following three states : the node that has never received the packet @xmath18 is in the state of susceptible ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a susceptible node goes into the state of infected and infectious ( @xmath20 ) immediately after receiving the packet @xmath18 .",
    "the node in state @xmath20 keeps transmitting the packet @xmath18 to every node it meets for a certain time period , which is referred to as the _ active period_. denote by @xmath21 the length of the active period of a type - h node .",
    "note that @xmath21 is a pre - determined value , which is the same for all nodes of the same type .",
    "after the active period , the node recovers and enters into state @xmath22 . a recovered node stops transmitting and receiving the packet @xmath18 .",
    "the nodes that have received the packet @xmath18 are referred to as the _ informed nodes of the packet @xmath18_.    note that the value of @xmath21 may be different for different types of nodes . for example , a pre - installed wifi ap can have a significantly larger value of @xmath21 compared with other mobile devices that are powered by battery .",
    "further , the value of @xmath21 for a mobile device can be tuned by introducing some incentives ( e.g. a lower subscription fee or some rewards ) to the mobile users @xcite , so that the mobile users are willing to share more packets with other users .",
    "when the length of the sharing phase @xmath11 is long , the epidemic sharing process stops naturally ( i.e. reaches the _ steady state _ )",
    "when , for all the packets , there is no infectious node .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case where the @xmath11 is long because it is suitable for delay - tolerant content disseminations and minimises the traffic load of the cellular network by fully utilising the complementary networks to share content .",
    "note that this paper considers a large network where @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , in the next section , when we consider an _",
    "asymptotic _ network with @xmath24 , we increase the network area @xmath25 while keeping the density of every type of nodes unchanged .",
    "that is , a well - known extended network model is considered .",
    "the analytical results obtained are therefore applicable for a large network only .",
    "the main challenge in the analysis of the content dissemination process is the characterisation of the packet propagation process in the sharing phase .",
    "this section first analyses the propagation process of a single packet , say the packet @xmath18 , and then generalises to multiple packets .",
    "denote by @xmath26 the inter - meeting time between a randomly - chosen type - h node and a randomly - chosen type - k node , for @xmath27 .",
    "assume that @xmath26 follows an exponential distribution with mean @xmath28 .",
    "the pdf of the inter - meeting time is then given by @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that the probability that the type - h node meets the type - k node during the active period @xmath21 of the type - h node is @xmath30    note that given other probability distribution of inter - meeting time , one can use a similar method to calculate @xmath31 .",
    "thus our analysis does not critically depend on the assumption of the exponential inter - meeting time distribution .      in this subsection",
    ", we construct a multi - type branching process @xcite to study the number of informed nodes of a typical packet , say packet @xmath18 , where the @xmath32 generation of the branching process includes the nodes that receive the packet @xmath18 at time @xmath33 ( i.e. in the first phase ) .",
    "further , the number of type - k children generated by a type - h node is denoted by a random variable @xmath34 .",
    "because nodes move independently of one another , it is evident that @xmath35 follows a binomial distribution @xmath36 , where @xmath31 is given in eq .",
    "[ eq_contact_prob ] .",
    "denote by @xmath37 the number of type - h nodes in the @xmath38 generation .",
    "the branching process modelling the number of informed nodes for a typical packet becomes _ extinct _ if there exists an integer value of @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "the following result is required in the later analysis :    define matrix @xmath41=n_k\\gamma_{h , k } ; h , k=1,2, ... ,h\\}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath42 be the largest eigenvalue of @xmath43 .",
    "then the branching process will become extinct with probability 1 if and only if @xmath44 .",
    "this result can be readily obtained by applying theorem 2 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter v ) .",
    "hence the proof is omitted .    when @xmath45 , there is a positive probability that the branching process does not become extinct , i.e. the packet can be disseminated to a significant fraction of nodes as",
    "the network size becomes asymptotically large .",
    "note that in a heterogeneous network , the type of source nodes that a branching process is rooted at can have a significant impact on the probability that the branching process becomes extinct .",
    "denote by @xmath46 the _ extinct probability of type - h source _ , which is defined as the probability that a branching process rooted at a type - h node becomes extinct .",
    "the following theorem characterises @xmath46 .",
    "[ thm_extinct ] consider an asymptotic network with @xmath25 while keeping nodes density unchanged and the node s communication range varying with @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is a finite constant .",
    "the extinct probabilities @xmath46 for @xmath49 are the solutions to the following system of equations : @xmath50    firstly , note that in the construction of the branching process , we consider that every node that a type - h node meets is a susceptible node . as the packet propagates , the probability that a type - h node meets an informed node increases .",
    "this may reduce the expected number of newly informed nodes generated by an infectious node .",
    "however , there is no need to consider the impact of this effect in the analysis of the extinct probability because when analysing the extinct probability , we are only interested in the case that the fraction of recipients is vanishingly small ( i.e. becomes extinct ) as @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , the probability that a type - h node meets an informed node is vanishingly small and hence negligible .    because @xmath48 is a finite constant as the network size increases ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath35 , i.e. a binomial distribution @xmath36 , approaches a poisson distribution with an expected value @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the @xmath35 and its poisson distribution counterpart ( denoted by @xmath51 ) diminishes as @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where the convergence rate is given in @xcite .",

    "the proof of the above two corollaries is straightforward and hence omitted .",
    "note that when the branching process does _ not _ become extinct , the packet is disseminated to a significant number of nodes and we say that _ the packet spreads out_. the next sub - section quantifies the number of recipients of a packet when it spreads out .",

    "firstly , when @xmath10 is small , two networks have a similar and relatively high cellular traffic load .",
    "this is because only a limited number of nodes receive the packets through the complementary network , hence most packets are directly transmitted to the users via cellular networks . as @xmath10 increases , the cellular traffic load first decreases rapidly , due to a rapid increase in the expected fraction of recipients in the sharing phase . then after a certain point , the cellular traffic load starts to gradually increases as @xmath10 further increases",
    "this is because the expected fraction of recipients has limited increase when @xmath10 increases further ; on the other hand the increase in @xmath10 causes more cellular data traffic .",
    "it is interesting to note that sending out more packets in the initial phase is not always beneficial .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that above a certain value of @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ pic_single_packet_optimization](a ) , the traffic load of cellular networks employing coding is significantly smaller than that of networks without coding , due to the following reason . recall that when @xmath120 , each node only needs @xmath9 different coded packets to decode all @xmath9 messages when coding is employed . on the other hand , in a network without coding ,",
    "there is a non - zero probability that two packets received at a node contain the same message .",
    "therefore a node may need more than @xmath9 packets .",
    "note that without employing the cooperative content dissemination strategy , the nodes need to request all packets from the cellular network and the traffic load of cellular networks is @xmath121 .",
    "compared with the values of @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ pic_single_packet_optimization ] , it is evident that the cooperative content dissemination strategy can significantly reduce the traffic load of cellular networks .     in networks with and without coding .",
    "note that subplot ( b ) shows the range @xmath122 $ ] of subplot ( a ) . ]",
    "this paper investigated a cooperative content dissemination strategy for heterogeneous networks consisting of different types of devices .",
    "the content dissemination strategy can effectively offload a significant amount of data traffic from cellular networks to complementary networks such as wifi and device - to - device networks using ad hoc connections that emerge when devices move and meet one another .",
    "theoretical analysis for the content dissemination process was presented . on that basis ,",
    "the optimal design of the content dissemination strategy was discussed , which maximally reduces traffic load of cellular networks while guaranteeing the successful delivery of all content .    in our paper , we consider that the duration of the sharing phase @xmath11 is sufficiently long such that the epidemic sharing process is able to reach its steady state . in the future , one may consider the case where only a short time period is allowed for the sharing phase , causing the epidemic sharing process to terminate before it reaches the steady state . in this case , non - trivial analysis is required to calculate the number of recipients of a packet at an arbitrary time instant .",
    "furthermore , it is an interesting extension of our work to consider different probability distributions for the inter - meeting time of nodes , which can be affected by the nodes mobility and network area as described in section [ section_system_model ] .",
