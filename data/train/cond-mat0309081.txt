    "polar ice cores are the focus of many investigations because they record the history of climatic changes .",
    "owing to snow accumulation , snow to ice transformation and slow ice sheet flow ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 ) , a journey down to the deep layers of the ice sheet is a journey back to several hundred of thousands of years into the past @xcite .",
    "a crucial step of paleoclimatic studies from ice cores is dating . in antarctica , counting annual layers is impossible @xcite : absolute dating is only possible for the very top of the ice cores where ice layers containing volcanic impurities can be related to historical volcanic eruptions .",
    "below , dating relies on ice sheet flow models of the evolution of ice layer thinning with depth @xcite .",
    "such models are loosely constrained by the identification of large climatic transitions . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "these models assume a smooth and monotonous increase of the thinning with depth , hence ignore any possible localization of the deformation @xcite .    in this letter , we question this essential assumption .",
    "we present a method to extract geometrical information ( such as thinning , shear , localization of the deformation ) from pictures of a cellular pattern using local spatial averages of the  texture tensor \" @xcite .",
    "we apply this analyzis to the grain boundaries ( the so - called  microstructure \" ) of ice samples from a deep ice core .",
    "dome concordia , antarctica ( 75@xmath2 06 04 `` s , 123@xmath2 20 52 '' e , elevation 3233 m a.s.l ) is at the summit of an antarctic ice dome .",
    "it has been chosen because it is usually assumed that the ice flow is axisymmetric around the vertical ( @xmath3 ) axis , and isotropic within the horizontal plane . in february 2003",
    ", the european ice core drilling program ( epica ) reached the depth of 3201.65 m below the ice surface , close to the ground ( depth 3309 @xmath4 22 m ) .",
    "samples have been extracted and transported according to standard procedures @xcite .",
    "we analyzed @xmath011  cm high , @xmath5  mm thin sections ( fig .",
    "[ polariseurs ] ) , with a sampling interval varying from 2 to 25 m. the vertical axis on a thin section always corresponds to the true ice core vertical axis @xmath3 ; its horizontal axis , labelled @xmath6 in what follows , has an unknown and variable orientation within the horizontal plane .",
    "the tilt of the core axis from the _ in situ _ vertical axis was below 0.5@xmath2 above @xmath7 m , then increased up to 5.2@xmath2 at 3100 m.",
    "by processing pictures of ice under crossed polarizers , we determine the grain boundaries @xcite , then the sites (  vertices \" ) where three boundaries meet , see fig .",
    "( [ polariseurs]a ) . for each pair of neighbouring sites",
    ", we draw the vector which links them and denote it by @xmath8 .",
    "we then construct the tensor @xmath9 : its coordinates are @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are here @xmath6 or @xmath3 ; this tensor is not sensitive to the sign of the vector ( it is invariant under @xmath12 ) , but it characterizes its length @xmath13 and its direction .    to statistically characterize the pattern , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed to define the _ texture tensor _ @xmath14 , as the average of @xmath15 over a box of fixed size .",
    "such box should be smaller than the image ( in order to visualize local details ) , but still large enough to include a number @xmath16 of wall vectors ( to have relevent statistics ) @xcite .",
    "here , grains have variable size ( grains grow with time , hence old grains in deep ice are much larger than young grains near the dome surface ) : it would be difficult to select such a fixed box size .",
    "we thus chose a local averaging and define @xmath14 at each given site as : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the rotation which diagonalizes @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the corresponding eigenvalues ; @xmath21 denotes the average over @xmath22 vectors , up to the @xmath23-th neighbours ( fig .",
    "[ polariseurs]a ) .",
    "hence , at each site we include approximately the same number of vectors , @xmath24 .",
    "a smaller @xmath23 explores local details , a larger @xmath23 ( hence a larger scale ) improves the statistics .",
    "this tensor , independent from cristallographic information , does not require any knowledge or hypothesis regarding the past history of the material .",
    "the diagonal components @xmath25 and @xmath26 of this tensor are both of order of the average square distance @xmath27 between sites .",
    "conversely , the off - diagonal component @xmath28 is much smaller , and even vanishes when the pattern is isotropic .",
    "hence @xmath29 : the largest eigenvalue corresponds to the direction in which grains are most elongated ( fig .",
    "[ polariseurs ] b and d ) .",
    "while many other quantitative descriptors exist @xcite , few are adapted to the determination of the anisotropy of such microstructure pattern .",
    "previous studies on polar ice calculate the aspect ratio of the grains from the linear intercept method @xcite .",
    "other use the eigenvalues of the grain inertia tensor @xcite ; this is a true tensor , with mathematical advantages : for instance , its value does not depend on the particular choice of axes , hence undergoes less artifacts when examining the 2d cut of a 3d pattern .",
    "the tensor @xmath14 has the same advantages ; but also an additional one , thanks to its definition ( eq . [ defm ] ) being quadratic in @xmath8 : it has a physical signification in terms of mechanical deformations @xcite .",
    "more precisely , its variations ( with respect to a reference @xmath30 measured in an isotropic , relaxed state ) define a statistical strain tensor @xmath31 : @xmath32 which exists even during large deformations and , at least during elastic deformations , coincides with the classical definition of strain @xcite .    for the 2d pattern studied here ,",
    "@xmath33 is unknown , and processes other than deformation ( such as grain growth ) modify the microstructure .",
    "we first assume that the ( viscoplastic ) deformation is isochore ( incompressibility of ice ) , so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we also assume that the reference state is isotropic ; hence @xmath33 is isotropic too , so that @xmath36 .",
    "we then can measure @xmath31 through the following equation : @xmath37 hence @xmath31 has two independent components @xmath38 and @xmath39 , both largely insensitive to the grain size fluctuations .    to estimate the statistical variability of the measure",
    ", we generate @xmath40 isotropic microstructures from a 2d potts model of normal grain growth @xcite .",
    "we check that ( i ) each component of @xmath41 fluctuates around zero ; ( ii ) its distribution is gaussian ( see an example with @xmath42 on fig .",
    "[ fig_angular ] ) ; ( iii ) its standard deviation @xmath43 only depends on the number @xmath22 of vectors , _",
    "i.e _ on the scale of observation @xmath23 ; and ( iv ) @xmath44 : more precisely , @xmath45 .",
    "we first measure the deformation and its heterogeneity within one sample . fig .",
    "( [ polariseurs]b ) shows that the upper sample ( depth 362 m ) is almost homogeneous .",
    "its anisotropy is small and , as expected from a sample taken at a dome , it mainly reflects a uniaxial compression along the vertical axis .",
    "conversely ( fig .",
    "[ polariseurs]d ) , the anisotropy of the lower sample , at 2629 m : is stronger ; is localized in space ; and breaks the axisymmetry around @xmath3 ( see discussion ) .",
    "this symmetry breaking can not result from the tilt of the ice core , as the grains are tilted in average by 13.5@xmath2 from the vertical , much more than the core tilt at 2629 m ( 2.6@xmath2 ) .",
    "quantitatively , the distributions of @xmath39 ( vertical compression ) and @xmath38 ( horizontal shear ) of both samples differ significantly ( fig . [ fig_angular ] ) .",
    "the upper sample is not sheared ( @xmath46 ) , and is slightly flattened onto the horizontal plane ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the lower sample is significantly sheared ( @xmath48 ) and strongly flattened ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath42 ( @xmath50 ) the intrinsic value of @xmath43 ( see above ) is 0.074 ; here , the statistical deviation ( @xmath51 ) is comparable , but slightly larger , reflecting the heterogeneity of deformation at small scales ( @xmath52 m ) .",
    "we now turn to heterogeneities at large scale ( @xmath53 m ) , by measuring the global @xmath54 ( integrated over all the grain boundaries of a given sample ) , _ versus _ the sample depth ( fig . [ fig_depth ] ) .",
    "whereas @xmath39 remains around zero , as expected in a dome situation , @xmath38 increases ( in absolute value ) with depth .",
    "the essential point is the localization : namely , the observation of a deformed ( sheared or compressed ) layer immediately close to less deformed ones . as mentioned , the grain size increases with depth , therefore the number of vectors per sample decreases [ fig_depth]a , hence @xmath43 increases .",
    "the localization is nevertheless significant , and is increasingly frequent at increasing depth ( closed circles on fig .",
    "[ fig_depth]b and c ) .",
    "since the pictures are 2d cuts of actual 3d grains , the apparent average grain size could be misestimated ; however , since @xmath54 is dimensionless , it should remain unaffected .",
    "when , and only when , the pattern is axisymmetric , we can refine the above analyzis ( eq . [ def ] ) . in that case , the eigenvectors are @xmath55 , and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath56 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath31 are now @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we have checked that the results corresponding to the 2d analyzis ( figs .",
    "[ fig_angular ] , [ fig_depth ] ) and the 3d one ( data not shown ) are completely similar , with even slightly more heterogeneities using the latter analysis .",
    "of course , care is required for the interpretation of an individual sheared sample ( for instance regarding @xmath38 at 2629 m , fig . [ fig_angular]b ) .",
    "but on average , the breaking of the axisymmetry hypothesis ( large open circles on fig .",
    "( [ fig_depth]c ) ) does not introduce significant artifacts on the compression heterogeneities we recorded ( closed circles on fig . [ fig_depth]c ) .",
    "a smooth shear deformation increasing with depth , sampled with a random azimuth , could lead to an apparent heterogeneity of both @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , this would imply an increasing anisotropy of the microstructure on the horizontal @xmath59 plane , whereas six horizontal thin sections were also analyzed ( very few were available ) and showed very small anisotropy .",
    "this isotropy of the horizontal thin sections analyzed , combined with the @xmath39 values highlighted on figure [ fig_depth]b is actually another expression of strain heterogeneity .",
    "processes such as normal grain growth counteract the anisotropy of grains induced by deformation .",
    "hence the strain recorded by the microstructure @xmath31 underestimates the strain @xmath60 actually experienced by the material .",
    "the growth rate itself could undergo some fluctuactions . at few depths , near the bottom of the core , a correlation has been observed between small grain sizes ( related to a large amount of dust in the ice @xcite ) and large strains . in these few cases , highlighted by the thick vertical lines in figure [ fig_depth]c",
    ", the large differences of @xmath38 observed between two adjacent layers could be partly explained by the difference in the grain growth rate .",
    "however , this effect is unable to explain most heterogeneities ( closed circles on fig . [ fig_depth]c ) .",
    "in addition , it does not explain the large number of shear layers ( closed circles on fig .",
    "[ fig_depth]b ) .",
    "we note here that such a correlation between grain size and @xmath38 would be difficult to explain in case of a strong effect of a random azimuth .",
    "we thus argue that the heterogeneity of anisotropy , observed at both small and large scales , can not be entirely an observation artifact and has a mechanical origin .",
    "a dating chart is the relation @xmath61 between depth @xmath3 and age @xmath62 of ice : it requires a model , and hypotheses .",
    "the ice core is drilled exactly at the summit of a dome , in order to assume that the flow is axisymmetric ; so that the ice thinning results from vertical compression only , without horizontal shear .",
    "current models further assume a smooth and monotonous increase of the thinning of ice defined as the ratio @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the thickness of the annual ice layer at depth @xmath3 .",
    "the second assumption has already been shown to be wrong in the greenland ice cores grip and gisp2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "flow disturbances have been reported within at least the @xmath65 deepest part of the gisp2 core , based on the observations of wavy ash layers , crystal stripings visible by eyes , and anomalous fabrics @xcite .",
    "the dating has been particularly questioned by the observation of a folding , _ i.e. _ local inversion of ice layers @xcite .    here",
    ", our method is more accurate and applies to ice itself , without requiring markers nor extreme events .",
    "we show that flow disturbances are detectable from almost the top of the ice sheet , and increase in number and intensity with depth .",
    "in fact , both dating model assumptions are contradicted by our results : the strain gradient is variable and not even always positive ( fig . [",
    "fig_depth]c ) ; and although the flow at a dome is axisymmetric on average , in detail there is a symmetry breaking due to shear , especially in deep layers ( fig . [ fig_depth]b ) .",
    "this suggests to reconsider current standard dating charts .",
