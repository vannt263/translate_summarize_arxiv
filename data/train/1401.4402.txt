    "recent progress in understanding effective field theories for time - dependent backgrounds has significantly broadened the scope of inflation and its predictions  @xcite .",
    "heavy field effects which are justifiably described in effective field theories are shown to be capable of leaving observable imprints in a cosmological background by reducing the effective speed of sound for the curvature perturbation  @xcite .",
    "inflationary dynamics involving heavy degrees of freedom can lead to oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a resonantly enhanced bispectrum  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the outliers in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite and hints of primordial oscillatory signals in the bispectrum  @xcite could well be echoing the effects of heavy fields during inflation .",
    "more generally , features that leave transient signals in the observable correlation functions can be generated by various mechanisms , such as a kink in the inflaton potential  @xcite .",
    "once generated , the effects permeate any correlation function through the mode function solution of the curvature perturbation .",
    "thus , the correlation functions of the primordial perturbation are all correlated and this offers a unique opportunity to detect higher order correlation functions . given the null detection of the bispectrum from planck  @xcite , detecting signals correlated in a certain manner is much more probable than blindly looking for them .    in this article",
    ", we study how to correlate the correlation functions of the primordial curvature perturbation by using the general slow - roll formalism ( gsr )  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we find that , other than source terms , higher order correlation functions can be characterized by the power spectrum , its spectral index and running for general single field inflation , regardless of whether there are features or not .",
    "thus our formalism has a wide range of applicability to inflationary scenarios .",
    "while the consistency condition of  @xcite relates the three - point function to the two - point one in the squeezed limit , the correlations we found are not limited to a special kinematic limit .",
    "we present the bispectrum as an example and discuss two simple cases where correlated features in the power spectrum and bispectrum can arise .",
    "we first extend gsr to general single field theory with the matter lagrangian @xmath0 in a form appropriate for our purpose . at second order ,",
    "the general effective action for the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath1 is @xmath2 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the speed of sound .",
    "introducing new variables  @xcite @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we find the mode equation which follows from this action given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the homogeneous solution which satisfies the boundary condition to reproduce the usual minkowski mode function as @xmath11 is the pure de sitter mode function , @xmath12 .",
    "then , with @xmath13 being a small perturbation , we can write the perturbative solution of @xmath14 using the green s function @xcite : @xmath15 y(u ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , up to the first order corrections , we have the power spectrum  @xcite @xmath16 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath17\\im[y_0(x)]/x$ ] , and we can define another window function @xmath18 \\right\\}^2/x$ ] [ see ( [ gsrbi ] ) ] .",
    "this formula is valid for models where the usual slow - roll approximation is not effective because of features in the inflaton potential  @xcite .    given that we have expressed the power spectrum purely in terms of the gsr fundamental function @xmath19 and its first and second derivatives , we can invert ( [ gsrpower ] ) to write @xmath20 in terms of @xmath21 @xcite : @xmath22 \\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath23 as well as @xmath13 , the source of the power spectrum , can be written in terms of @xmath21 and its first two derivatives , i.e. the spectral index and the running : @xmath24 + \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dk}{k } m(k\\tau ) \\frac{d\\log{{\\cal p}}_{{\\cal r}}}{d\\log k } \\right]^2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in summary , given the power spectrum , we can construct the gsr fundamental function @xmath20 and thus the mode function solution ( [ gsrsol ] ) .",
    "this in turn enables us to explicitly correlate other higher order correlation functions with the power spectrum .",
    "to be more specific , we now compute the bispectrum and explicitly correlate it to the power spectrum . starting from the cubic order action  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , an immediate difficulty we face when we apply gsr is that with many time derivatives the formulae become highly non - trivial .",
    "this is because the full gsr solution @xmath14 is a perturbative series and the number of terms we should incorporate increases rapidly .",
    "thus , we first need to reduce the number of time derivatives to save our labour . for this , we make use of the linear equation of motion , @xmath25 \\dot{{\\cal r}}- \\frac{c_s^2}{a^2}\\delta{{\\cal r}}\\right\\ } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . denoting schematically the coefficient of @xmath28 inside the square brackets as @xmath29 , the term @xmath30 in the cubic action",
    "can be written with one time derivative on @xmath31 as @xmath32 \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 denotes schematically the coefficient of @xmath30 , and we have omitted the spatial gradient terms which are suppressed on large scales . thus we see that essentially we can reduce @xmath30 term to @xmath34 with a field redefinition which includes more terms multiplied by the linear equation @xmath35 .",
    "we can proceed similarly for the @xmath36 term , and we find , with @xmath37 denoting the coefficient schematically , @xmath38 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] explicitly writing out the coefficients , the cubic order action from the matter sector , which is less suppressed than that from the gravitational sector and thus more relevant for observations , is given by @xmath39 \\lambda \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{3.5 cm } \\left .",
    "+ c_sah\\tau \\left",
    "( 3s+\\frac{\\epsilon\\eta}{2 } - \\epsilon s - 6us \\right ) - \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{d}{d\\log\\tau } \\left ( \\frac{\\eta}{c_s^2 } \\right ) \\right ] \\frac{d}{d\\tau } \\left ( \\frac{{{\\cal r}}^3}{3 } \\right ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the `` source function '' @xmath44 for the bispectrum is obtained by multiplying the coefficient of @xmath45 by @xmath46 . in particular , if we are interested in the case where a heavy degree of freedom is responsible for a non - unity @xmath4",
    "@xcite , we find simply that @xmath47 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the bispectrum up to first order corrections is found to be  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath23 and @xmath13 are given by ( [ inverse1 ] ) and ( [ inverse2 ] ) respectively in terms of @xmath21 and its derivatives , @xmath49 and additional window functions are constructed from @xmath50 as @xmath51 in ( [ gsrbi ] ) , the implicit dependence of @xmath52 on @xmath4 does not matter practically , since we can make all the inner integrations with respect to @xmath53 from 0 to @xmath54 by incorporating appropriate step functions .",
    "then the information on the speed of sound is encoded in @xmath20 , and in turn in @xmath21 .",
    "before we proceed , we turn to the effective field theory point of view  @xcite . in that perspective , the effective action is specified by a set of mass scales @xmath55 , which are essentially the expansion parameters of the effective field theory and are in principle independent couplings . up to cubic order ,",
    "the action is completely specified by @xmath56 and @xmath57 . as can be read from ( [ s2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath4 is determined at second order , viz . by @xmath56 , but @xmath57 is to be specified independently  @xcite .",
    "this appears in ( [ gsrbi ] ) as the bispectrum source @xmath44 , which in general is independent from the power spectrum source @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that @xmath58 is related to @xmath59 with the precise form being dependent on specific models .",
    "for example , @xmath60 for dbi inflation  @xcite and @xmath61 when a single heavy degree of freedom is integrated out  @xcite .",
    "the source @xmath44 can be explicitly connected to @xmath21 for specific cases  @xcite .",
    "we now present two simple illustrative examples .",
    "we specifically choose examples in which features arise to exhibit the generality of our approach vis -  - vis e.g. effective field theory approaches .",
    "first we consider an inflation model  @xcite where the slope of the linear potential changes abruptly from @xmath62 to @xmath63 at @xmath64",
    ". the usual slow - roll condition is violated at @xmath65 since @xmath66 experiences a sharp change , which causes oscillatory features .",
    "if @xmath67 so that the approximate scale invariance of @xmath21 is maintained , we can write the bispectrum source as @xmath68 . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : examples ]",
    "we show the results with @xmath69 so that the slope becomes steeper with time .",
    "then the power spectrum is suppressed for @xmath70 , as shown in the plot . to estimate the shape and magnitude of the bispectrum",
    ", we may define a dimensionless shape function as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the observed amplitude of the power spectrum  @xcite . in the lower left panel",
    "shown are @xmath73 projected on equilateral ( @xmath74 , solid line ) , folded ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 , dot - dashed line ) and squeezed ( @xmath75 and @xmath77 , dashed line ) limits , and the difference of @xmath78 computed by direct calculations and by inverse formula , @xmath79 .",
    "likewise , in the right panel of figure  [ fig : examples ] we show the case where @xmath80 exhibits a top - hat change  @xcite from 1 to 1.1 for limited @xmath81-folds 0.15 .",
    "to conclude , we have presented a systematic approach for correlating the correlation functions of the primordial curvature perturbation produced during inflation .",
    "we have shown that in general , other than the source terms , any higher order correlation functions are characterized by the power spectrum , its spectral index and running .",
    "this approach should be useful in the search for higher order correlation functions of primordial perturbations .",
