    "numerical simulations of black holes have recently experienced a dramatic breakthrough ( see @xcite as well as numerous later publications ) .",
    "many of these simulations now adopt some variation of the bssn formulation @xcite together with moving - puncture coordinates @xcite to handle the black hole singularities ( see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "moving - puncture coordinates adopt the 1+log slicing condition for the lapse function @xcite and a gamma - driver condition for the shift vector @xcite .",
    "the properties of moving - puncture coordinates have been studied in detail for schwarzschild spacetimes @xcite . in particular , these studies show that dynamical evolutions of schwarzschild black holes with moving - puncture coordinates settle down to a slice that ends on a sphere of finite areal radius .",
    "when displayed in an embedding diagram ( see , e.g. , figure 2 in @xcite ) , these slices resemble a trumpet , which motivates the name  trumpet geometry \" .",
    "the properties of these slices , in particular the fact that they do not extend to the singularity but instead end at finite areal radius , explain why these slices are well suited for dynamical simulations .",
    "studying interactions of matter and black holes , which is important for many problems of astrophysical interest , requires relaxing the assumption of pure vacuum and including matter sources in the numerical simulations . while numerous simulations have already adopted moving - puncture coordinates in evolution calculations involving matter ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the properties of these coordinates in non - vacuum spacetimes are less well understood than in vacuum spacetimes .    in a recent study ,",
    "thierfelder @xcite analyzed the collapse of a spherically symmetric , unstable fluid star using two variations of moving - puncture coordinates ( see their equation ( 2 ) ) . in the version that is similar to the gamma - driver condition most commonly used in binary black hole simulations ( @xmath0 in their equation ( 2 ) ; see also @xcite ) , the grid - points are pulled out of the star at late times during the collapse ( see also @xcite as well as the discussion at the end of chapter 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "all matter is effectively removed from the computational grid , and the simulation settles down to a trumpet geometry that becomes indistinguishable from that of a vacuum black hole . during this process the stellar interior becomes poorly resolved ; this can make the code crash unless certain hydrodynamical values are prevented from taking unphysical values ( see @xcite for details ) . in an alternative version of the gamma - driver shift condition ( @xmath1 in their equation ( 2 ) ) , the grid points are not pulled out of the star . instead , the grid - points are  frozen \" at late times and remain in the stellar interior ; this approach leaves the matter well resolved even at late times .",
    "a classical , analytical solution describing the collapse of matter into a black hole is oppenheimer - snyder ( os ) collapse of a homogeneous dust sphere @xcite .",
    "this solution has served as a testbed for numerous numerical codes , and it has proven useful to transform this solution , originally derived in gaussian normal coordinates , into coordinate systems that are more commonly used in numerical simulations ( including maximal slicing @xcite , polar slicing @xcite and  observer - time \" coordinates @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study os collapse in moving - puncture coordinates as well , which we do below .",
    "moving - puncture coordinates form a rather complicated set of equations .",
    "it appears impossible to obtain a complete analytical solution to the os collapse problem in these coordinates .",
    "however , we can obtain some partial analytical results and we do so here to illuminate our numerical integrations .",
    "specifically , we find that at early times the matter density , lapse function , and mean curvature remain constant in space while varying in time .",
    "we also show that these functions remain spatially constant until a gauge mode has propagated from the stellar surface . finally , we derive a lower limit for the lapse function at the center of the dust cloud .",
    "os collapse poses another interesting question : can the lapse in moving - puncture coordinates collapse sufficiently fast for the slicing to avoid the black hole singularity , and to exhibit a transition to a trumpet geometry ? as demonstrated by @xcite ,",
    "this is the case for collapse of a fluid star with pressure . in the absence of pressure , however , as in os collapse , the matter collapses more rapidly , leaving the lapse less time to drop to zero and avoid the singularity . in this sense , os collapse poses a more stringent test than the collapse of a fluid star with pressure .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that , even for os collapse , moving - puncture coordinates do avoid the singularity and allow for a transition to a trumpet geometry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ os ]",
    "we review the os solution and introduce a transformation to general coordinates . in section [ early_times ]",
    "we specialize to the 1+log slicing condition .",
    "we show that the density , lapse , and mean curvature remain spatially constant at each point of the stellar interior until that point is reached by a gauge mode propagating from the stellar surface . in section [ late_times ] we present the full numerical solution .",
    "we use this solution to probe the late - time behavior of os collapse , demonstrating the transition to a trumpet geometry .",
    "we briefly summarize our results in section [ sum ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use geometrized units in which @xmath2 .",

    "we now impose the 1+log slicing condition @xmath48 here the mean curvature @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath49 we will also use the time evolution equation for @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the covariant derivative associated with the spatial metric @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath53 is the matter density as observed by a normal observer , and @xmath54 is the trace of the spatial stress , again as observed by a normal observer .",
    "we note that the slicing condition ( [ 1+log ] ) can also be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the normal vector on each slice of constant coordinate time @xmath4 ( which , in general , is different from @xmath57 ) , and where @xmath58 is the proper time as observed by such a normal observer .",
    "this shows that 1+log slicing is invariant under spatial coordinate transformations , i.e.  independent of the choice of the shift ( see also @xcite ) . in order to find the lapse @xmath59 , we may therefore choose whatever shift is convenient , and we will consider two different choices below .",
    "we also observe that the pair of equations formed by the 1+log slicing condition ( [ 1+log ] ) and the evolution equation for the mean curvature ( [ k_dot ] ) can be combined to form a wave equation for the lapse . for simplicity we may assume vanishing shift . taking a time derivative of equation ( [ 1+log ] ) and using the result to eliminate the term @xmath60 in ( [ k_dot ] ) we obtain an inhomogeneous wave equation of the form @xmath61 where the right hand side contains lower - order terms that do not affect the wave operator on the left - hand side .",
    "we first show that if @xmath59 , @xmath50 and @xmath16 are spatially constant in a region of a spatial slice , then they will remain spatially constant in the domain of dependence of this region .",
    "these quantities may then change in time , but not in space .",
    "this result can be verified directly from the equations ; it is easier , however , to see this from the properties of os collapse .    according to equation ( [ density ] ) , slices of constant @xmath16 in os collapse correspond to slices of constant proper time @xmath17 ( which is measured along the trajectories of dust particles ) .",
    "the region that we are considering therefore corresponds to a region of a slice of constant @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the normal on these slices is aligned with the four - velocity of the dust particles , @xmath62 , which implies @xmath63 . according to equation ( [ k_gn ] ) ,",
    "@xmath50 is also constant on such a slice .",
    "we now assume a more general , but still spatially constant , lapse . integrating forward to a new time slice of constant coordinate time @xmath64",
    ", the proper time as measured along the slice s normal ( and hence along the dust particle s trajectory ) will increase by @xmath65 . in a region where @xmath59 is spatially constant",
    ", the new slice will again correspond to a slice of constant @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , with @xmath50 constant in this region , equation ( [ 1+log_normal ] ) shows that the lapse will again be constant on the new slice .",
    "in particular , this argument applies to early times , assuming the integration starts with a constant initial lapse @xmath66 . on the other hand",
    ", this argument does not apply at the surface of the star . at the star s surface ,",
    "the density @xmath67 is discontinuous , and since this quantity appears on the right hand side of ( [ k_dot ] ) , the mean curvature will not remain spatially constant .",
    "we therefore expect that the surface will trigger a deviation that propagates into the star , satisfying the wave equation ( [ lapse_wave ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath67 , @xmath50 and @xmath59 will remain spatially constant at any location in the star only until this deviation has arrived ; i.e.  in the domain of dependence of the initial stellar interior .",
    "we show a numerical demonstration of this behavior in figure [ fig2 ] .    assuming a spatially constant lapse we can obtain its analytic value by choosing @xmath68 . equation ( [ 1+log ] ) then simplifies and can be integrated immediately to yield @xmath69 where the subscript 0 denotes initial values at @xmath19 . inserting the determinant ( [ det ] ) we find @xmath70 it is difficult to make further progress in general .",
    "if we assume , however , that the lapse has remained spatially constant , as it does at early times , then the above expression simplifies .",
    "while the lapse remains constant , slices of constant time @xmath4 will coincide with slices of constant @xmath17 , meaning that @xmath71 and that @xmath72 . for zero shift ,",
    "coordinate observers are comoving with normal observers ; this means that the new coordinates @xmath35 are comoving with the fluid , which , in turn , are described by fixed values of the original radial coordinate @xmath3 . for zero shift , and as long as the lapse remains constant , we therefore have @xmath73 , and the lapse ( [ lapse_general ] ) reduces to @xmath74 alternatively , this expression can be derived by observing that , on slices of constant @xmath17 , the mean curvature is given by ( [ k_gn ] ) , so that for vanishing shift equation ( [ 1+log ] ) can be integrated directly to yield ( [ lapse_const ] )",
    ".      we will now show that the expression on the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lapse_const ] ) is a lower limit for the lapse function . to begin , we choose the shift vector in such a way that @xmath75 at all times . in this case",
    "we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 , so that the lapse reduces to @xmath78 and the shift to @xmath79 regularity at the origin demands @xmath68 there , which implies @xmath71 at @xmath38 ( as long as @xmath80 ) .",
    "this means that slices of constant coordinate time @xmath4 must be tangent to slices of constant @xmath17 at the origin , as indicated in figure [ fig1 ] . inserting the lapse and shift , together with ( [ k ] ) , into the 1+log slicing condition ( [ 1+log ] ) , and evaluating the resulting expression at the origin @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 this is a complicated equation for @xmath17 , and it is again difficult to make progress , even after having restricted the analysis to the origin .",

    "red , green , blue and magenta lines correspond to @xmath89 0 , 14 , 24 and 34 , respectively.,width=576 ]    results for the lapse @xmath59 at early times have already been shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "all of these results have been obtained with the gauge condition ( [ gamma_driver ] ) , and demonstrate the existence of a region of decreasing radius around the origin in which these quantities remain spatially constant .",
    "we now turn to results for late times of the collapse . in this section",
    "we will focus on @xmath131 ; we will discuss more general results below .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show profiles of the lapse as a function of radius at different times @xmath4 , as obtained with the shift condition ( [ gamma_driver ] ) .",
    "we also include the analytical lapse for trumpet slices of schwarzschild in ",
    "stationary 1+log \" slicing , which satisfies the equation @xmath152 with @xmath153 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "evidently , the lapse as obtained from os collapse in moving - puncture coordinates asymptotes to that for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this is not surprising for the stellar exterior , of course , but one might have expected that an interior region remains in which the density remains different from zero , and in which the lapse differs from that of a vacuum spacetime . as discussed in @xcite , however , the shift condition ( [ gamma_driver ] ) pushes all grid points into the stellar exterior in a finite time , so that the stellar interior remains unresolved and removed from the grid .",
    "this effect is also visible in figure [ fig6 ] , where we show profiles of the density @xmath16 for different coordinate times @xmath4 . in the left panel",
    "we again show results for the shift condition ( [ gamma_driver ] ) . at late times , the density drops to zero everywhere , indicating that all grid points having been pushed out of the stellar interior . in the right panel",
    "we show the same results for the shift condition ( [ alt_shift ] ) . here , grid points are frozen at late times , and remain in the stellar interior , which is well - resolved even at late times .    in figure [ stdiagram ]",
    "we show spacetime diagrams , similar to those in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , to further illustrate the influence of the shift condition on the late - time trajectories of gridpoints . in each plot",
    ", the blue lines correspond to surfaces of constant areal radius , the green region marks the stellar interior , and the red line denotes the apparent horizon . in the left panel",
    "we show results for the shift condition ( [ gamma_driver ] ) , for which no gridpoints remain in the stellar interior at late times , while the right panel shows results for the shift condition ( [ alt_shift ] ) , for which the stellar interior remains well resolved even at late times .",
    "the apparent horizon first appears when the stellar surface passes through @xmath154 , as in gaussian - normal coordinates ( compare , e.g. , fig .  1.3 in @xcite ) .    in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we show the central density @xmath155 as a function of time , as obtained with the shift condition ( [ alt_shift ] ) .",
    "in the left panel we show the central density as a function of proper time , and compare with the analytical result ( [ density ] ) .",
    "we see that the numerical evolution terminates at the proper time @xmath108 ( see also the spacetime diagram in figure [ fig4 ] ) , when the lapse collapses to zero and prevents any further advance in proper time ( recall @xmath65 ) . in the right panel",
    "we show the central density as a function of coordinate time , which continues to advance even after the lapse has collapsed to zero .",
    "in this graph , the density levels off to the limiting value @xmath151 , corresponding to the value of the central density at proper time @xmath108 .    finally , we show profiles of the shift @xmath156 in figure [ fig8 ] . as before ,",
    "we show results obtained with the shift condition ( [ gamma_driver ] ) in the left panel .",
    "note that at late times , these lines terminate at a finite value of the areal radius @xmath87 , corresponding to the limiting surface of the trumpet solution . in the right panel , showing results obtained with ( [ alt_shift ] ) , the shift for small @xmath87 drops to zero at late times , indicating that the corresponding gridpoints are  frozen \" in the interior of the star .",
    "in the previous section we showed that for os collapse with an initial areal radius of @xmath131 , the 1+log slicing condition successfully halts the advance of the spatial slices before the singularity forms . in this section",
    "we consider other values of @xmath14 ; in particular we evaluate whether or not , for smaller initial radii , the singularity forms too quickly for the lapse to halt the evolution .",
    "we have investigated this question numerically .",
    "our simulations show that the 1+log condition has no difficulty handling the collapse of arbitrarily small dust spheres , which , perhaps , is not surprising .",
    "figure [ fig4a ] shows the initial conformal factor @xmath147 as a function of isotropic radius @xmath35 for different initial areal radii @xmath157 , as well as the conformal factor for `` wormhole '' schwarzschild initial data .",
    "as @xmath14 decreases and approaches the limit @xmath158 , the initial data approach that of a black hole . the black hole is the most stringent scenario , for which the lapse must collapse as quickly as possible to keep the slice from reaching the singularity .",
    "we also see this from the proper time ( [ tau_sing ] ) that elapses before the singularity is reached . for @xmath133",
    "we have @xmath159 , which is the same time required for a normal observer at the center of a kruskal diagram of a schwarzschild black hole to reach the singularity .",
    "numerous numerical simulations of the schwarzschild spacetime , evolving ",
    "wormhole \" initial data with moving - puncture coordinates , demonstrate that the lapse collapses sufficiently fast to avoid the singularity ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; apparently the same holds for os collapse for any value of @xmath14 .    for @xmath133 ,",
    "the initial ball of dust is just inside its own schwarzschild radius . in the spirit of black hole",
    " stuffing \" @xcite , we can evolve the data with or without the matter fields . omitting the matter terms in the black hole interior and evolving the initial data as if they were vacuum data leads to a violation of the constraints in the black hole interior",
    "; however , these constraint violations do not affect the black hole exterior , and disappear even in the interior after a short evolution of the data .",
    "we analyze os collapse , describing the collapse of a homogeneous dust sphere initially at rest to a black hole , in moving - puncture coordinates .",
    "these coordinates have proven particularly robust for handling vacuum black holes in numerical simulations and this has motivated our interest in exploring how they behave in the presence of matter sources .",
    "we obtain the complete solution for os collapse numerically and elucidate some of the key results analytically , especially for the early - time behavior .",
    "in particular , we show that if the initial lapse @xmath66 is chosen constant , then the lapse @xmath59 , the density @xmath67 and the mean curvature @xmath50 will remain spatially constant in a region around the center of the star that decreases in size , and that disappears at a critical time @xmath90 . in this region , which is marked as the shaded region in figure [ fig4 ] , the lapse is given by equation ( [ lapse_const ] ) .",
    "the region is limited by a gauge mode that originates at the surface of the star and travels inwards at a speed that exceeds the speed of light ( see equation ( [ v_prop ] ) ) .",
    "we identify @xmath90 with the time at which this characteristic , marked by the solid line in figure [ fig4 ] , reaches the stellar center . at the center of the star ,",
    "equation ( [ lapse_ll ] ) serves as a lower limit on the lapse ; the lapse agrees with this lower limit for times up to @xmath90 , but starts to deviate abruptly at that time .    with the gamma - driver shift condition ( [ gamma_driver ] ) , grid points are pulled out of the stellar interior at late times , so that the numerical grid covers only the exterior of the star .",
    "the numerical solution asymptotes to a trumpet slice of a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this confirms the findings of @xcite and demonstrates that , even in the absence of pressure , the lapse collapses sufficiently fast to avoid the forming singularity , and to allow the transition to a trumpet geometry .",
    "we also confirm that with the alternative shift condition ( [ alt_shift ] ) with @xmath1 the coordinate grid points remain in the stellar interior and the star is well - resolved even at late times .",
