    "qcd successfully describes the dynamics of quarks and gluons in the perturbative regime .",

    "large-@xmath0 qcd has played an important role on our understanding of qcd [ 13 ] . especially in two dimensions , that is , in the t hooft model , a bound - state equation is obtained .",

    "the fourier transformation of the bilocal auxiliary fields determines the parton momentum distribution function . from the effective lagrangian",

    "we briefly review qcd@xmath4 with the light - cone gauge . in section 3 , we derive the large-@xmath0 effective lagrangian , and we decompose the auxiliary fields into the vacuum expectation value and its fluctuation field .",
