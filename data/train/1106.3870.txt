    "phase transitions are sudden changes of the macroscopic behavior of a physical system composed by many interacting parts occurring while an external parameter is smoothly varied , generally the temperature , but e.g. in a quantum phase transition is the external magnetic field .",
    "the successful description of phase transitions starting from the properties of the microscopic interactions between the components of the system is one of the major achievements of equilibrium statistical mechanics .    from a statistical - mechanical point of view , in the canonical ensemble , a phase transition occurs at special values of the temperature @xmath1 called transition points , where thermodynamic quantities such as pressure , magnetization , or heat capacity , are non - analytic functions of @xmath1 .",
    "these points are the boundaries between different phases of the system .",
    "starting from the exact solution of the two - dimensional ising model @xcite by onsager @xcite , these singularities have been found in many other models , and later developments like the renormalization group theory @xcite have considerably deepened our knowledge of the properties of the transition points .",
    "but in spite to the success of equilibrium statistical mechanics the issue of the deep origin of a phase transition remains open , and this motivates further studies of phase transitions . in this paper",
    "we present a @xmath0-symmetric classical spin model showing a first order symmetry breaking phase transition which , in our knowledge , is one of the most elementary models capable to show such a phenomenon in the canonical treatment .",
    "we think that in it the general mechanism of entailing symmetry breaking phase transitions acts , and that it becomes manifest due to the extreme simplicity of the model .",
    "the model is derived from the `` hypercubic model '' introduced in @xcite by replacing the real variables with classical spin ones , and it can be consider as a drastic simplification of the mean - field ising model .    in more physically realistic models we think that the mechanism entailing phase transitions may be the same , but that it remains hidden due to the complexity of the models , also in that cases in which the canonical thermodynamic is analytically solvable . indeed ,",
    "even if the analytic solution is at disposal , we can find out whether a system undergoes to a phase transition or not only by analyzing the solution , but we do not know any general criterion capable to predict such a phenomenon founded only on the properties of the potential energy landscape .",
    "anyway we have to remark a limitation of the model we present , because being the potential writable as a function of the order parameter , a.i .",
    "the magnetization , the model has to be considered belonging to the class of infinite - range systems , which are not very realistic from the physical viewpoint .",
    "anyway , the mechanism entailing the phase transition may contain some features which may be in future generalized to the finite - range case .",
    "this is under study .",
    "returning to the potential , it is a double - well function of the magnetization @xmath2 .",
    "since the entropy @xmath3 is a concave function due to the geometry of configuration space , the phase transition emerges by the competition between the potential and the entropy in shaping the free energy @xmath4 , which can have one or two absolute minima with respect to the magnetization depending on the value of the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is less than the critical temperature , @xmath5 becomes a double - well function as well the potential and the symmetry is broken , while if @xmath1 is greater than the critical temperature , @xmath5 remains a convex function as well the entropic term @xmath6 and the symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "this picture of the free energy is exactly the one imagined by landau - ginzburg @xcite in order to describe phenomenologically classical continuous phase transitions , but it can apply also to the first order ones as for the model of this paper .",
    "section [ skeleton ] is devoted to the introduction of the new model and to its study in great details .",
    "further , section [ ising ] , and [ berlinkac ] are devoted to the ising @xcite and berlin - kac @xcite models in the mean - field version revisited in order to show the occurrence of their well known classic continuous phase transitions by the same mechanism of the model introduced here .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite a simple model with first order @xmath0-symmetry breaking phase transition has been introduced .",
    "it has been called  hypercubic model  because the interaction among the @xmath7 continuous degrees of freedom is by a double - well potential with a gap proportional to @xmath7 constructed by hypercubes of @xmath8 .    from the hypercubic model we derive a more essential model by replacing the @xmath9",
    "coordinate @xmath10 with the classical spin @xmath11 , the same of the ising model . in order to reproduce the double - well potential",
    "we define the potential in the following way @xmath12 in this way the potential has a gap proportional to @xmath7 which separates the two wells .",
    "the constant @xmath13 plays the role of the strength of the interaction , and it modulates the critical temperature of the phase transition .    from a physical viewpoint",
    "such a potential may be regarded as the tendency of the spins to be in the two states @xmath14 , @xmath15 by a completely delocalized interaction among the spins proportional to their number @xmath7 .",
    "this is similar to what happens in some quantum systems , where the non - locality of the wave function can produce particular kinds of interaction depending only on the number of particles and not on their distances .",
    "the thermodynamic can be solved in one shot , by using the decomposition formula    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the microcanonical density of states at fixed @xmath7 , so    @xmath18    in the limit of large @xmath7 only one between the two exponentials of the right hand side of the last equation survives , so @xmath19 can be approximated as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the critical temperature .",
    "@xmath22 separates two different analytic forms of @xmath23 .    in the thermodynamic limit the free energy ,",
    "the average potential , and the specific heat are respectively    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26     for @xmath27 .",
    "the smooth lines are for @xmath28 , and show the nonuniform convergence toward a discontinuous limit corresponding to a first order phase transition with @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.5% ]   for @xmath27 .",
    "the smooth lines are for @xmath28 , and show the nonuniform convergence toward a discontinuous limit corresponding to a first order phase transition with @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.5% ]   for @xmath27 .",
    "the smooth lines are for @xmath28 , and show the nonuniform convergence toward a discontinuous limit corresponding to a first order phase transition with @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.5% ]   for @xmath27 .",
    "the smooth lines are for @xmath28 , and show the nonuniform convergence toward a discontinuous limit corresponding to a first order phase transition with @xmath29.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.5% ]    we can also give the relative expressions for finite @xmath7    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    now consider the magnetization .",
    "as @xmath33 the average potential is @xmath34 , so that the only configurations accessible to the representative point are @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , at which the values of the magnetization per degree of freedom @xmath35 , and @xmath36 correspond , respectively . since in the thermodynamic limit the probability of overturning simultaneously all the spins is vanishing , the magnetization has to be fixed in one of the two possible values .    as @xmath37 the average potential is @xmath38 , so that the representative point can freely go around the whole lattice expect the sites @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the magnetization is vanishing because in the thermodynamic limit the most probable configuration is the one with half spins @xmath39 , and half spins @xmath40 .",
    "thus    @xmath41    summarizing , we are in front of the complete picture of a first order @xmath0-symmetry breaking phase transition , despite the dramatic simplicity of the model .",
    "it is worth noticing that the potential ( [ skel_v ] ) has to be considered as the effect of a completely delocalized interaction among the spins , thus it is infinite - range .",
    "we recall that the configuration space of the hypercubic model presented in @xcite is made by a hypercube @xmath42 centered in the origin of coordinates where the potential takes the value @xmath43 , except in two smaller hypercubes @xmath44 , and @xmath45 included in @xmath42 where the potential takes the value @xmath46 .",
    "the hypercubes @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are such to be the images one of the other under @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "the model shows a first order symmetry breaking with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the side of the hypercube @xmath42 , and @xmath49 is the side of the hypercubes @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "so , the class of the hypercubic models depends on two free parameters : @xmath50 , and the quotient @xmath51 . if @xmath48 is strictly greater than @xmath52 , some freedom to dispose @xmath44 , and @xmath45 into @xmath42 advances , but it does not affect the thermodynamic functions , but only the value of the magnetization .",
    "the class of the models introduced in this section depends on the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the mapping from this class and the hypercubic models one can be made by identifying the lattice sites @xmath14 , and @xmath15 with the centers of mass of the hypercubes @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "since the statistical weight of a single lattice site is @xmath39 and the weight of the whole lattice is @xmath54 , the same proportion has to hold between the volume of the hypercubes @xmath44 , or @xmath45 , and the hypercube @xmath42 , so that @xmath55 has to be assumed .",
    "finally , in order to complete the mapping we make the identification @xmath56 .    the critical temperature results @xmath57 , as it has to be , and the thermodynamic functions are the same .",
    "since the model of this section depends on one parameter only , it is in some extents more essential in what concern the mechanism giving rise to the phase transition with respect to the hypercubic model .",
    "further , due to the discreteness of configuration space , it is possible to evaluate the effect of an external magnetic field , as we will see in section [ skel_mf ] .      in section [ skeleton ]",
    "we have calculated the partition function by decomposing it in a sum on the values of the potential which are @xmath46 , @xmath58 , but we can also choose to decompose it in a sum on the values of the magnetization , which will begin an integral in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "in this way we can deduce the shape of the free energy with its minima as a function of the magnetization , and moreover we can evaluate the effect of an external magnetic field applied to the system .",
    "let @xmath60 be a positive integer which counts the number of spins @xmath61 in a configuration of the system , so @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath60 labels the subsets of configuration space @xmath63 at constant magnetization @xmath64 defined as    @xmath65    the configuration space is reconstructed by the disjointed union of all the @xmath64 s : @xmath66 . the relation which links @xmath60 to the corresponding magnetization @xmath67 is @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 .",
    "the potential can by written as a function of @xmath60    @xmath70    and so the partition function can be decomposed as a summation over all the values of @xmath60    @xmath71    where @xmath72 ( `` vol '' stand for `` volume '' , even though this word generally refers to continuous sets , but with a small abuse of language we use it also for discrete sets .",
    "a more appropriate word may be `` cardinality '' ) is the number of lattice sites belonging to @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath72 is nothing but the density of states at fixed magnetization , which is liked to the entropy density at fixed magnetization @xmath73 by the relation @xmath74 .",
    "it turns out that    @xmath75    where @xmath76 are the binomial coefficients .",
    "so    @xmath77    in order to search for the thermodynamic limit , we can use the stirling formula to approximate the factorials in the binomial coefficients for large @xmath7    @xmath78    recalling that @xmath79 , we can express @xmath19 in terms of the magnetization @xmath67 , and then make the substitution @xmath80 where @xmath2 is a continuous real variable belonging to the interval @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "this substitution is possible because as @xmath59 the values of @xmath67 becomes dense and equally spaced in the interval @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "thus    @xmath82    the potential , and the entropy densities as functions of @xmath2 remain defined respectively as follows    @xmath83    @xmath84    the free energy @xmath85 is plotted in figure [ skeleton_fm ] .     as @xmath33 ( left ) , and",
    "as @xmath37 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=22.5% ]   as @xmath33 ( left ) , and as @xmath37 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=22.5% ]    the central minimum of @xmath5 is @xmath86 which competes with the two other extreme minima @xmath87 in order to determine the absolute minima , and so giving rise to the critical temperature of the system @xmath21 .",
    "the magnetization is already given in ( [ skeleton_mt ] ) .",
    "_ the fact that the potential ( [ skel_v ] ) is a function of @xmath2 lets to separate the contribute of the boltzmann factor and the density of states at fixed @xmath2 in the calculation of the partition function . since the density of states increases as @xmath88 due to the dimension of configuration space which increases as @xmath7 , setting the jump proportional to @xmath7 is a necessary and sufficient condition in order to entail the phase transition . indeed ,",
    "if the gap increased faster than @xmath7 the potential would not be intensive , while if the gap increased more slowly than @xmath7 the phase transition would disappear .",
    "the fact that the partition function can be exactly solved allows us to discuss the exact localization of the fisher zeros @xcite , the zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane . because the analyticity of @xmath19 , the zeros have not to lie on the real axis , but if a singularity is present in @xmath89 in the limit @xmath59 , they have to converge to the real axis in correspondence of the critical temperature .",
    "the fisher zeros are the analog of the zeros of the grand canonical partition function in the complex fugacity plane introduced by yang and lee in @xcite .",
    "we introduce the inverse temperature @xmath90 and solve the equation    @xmath91    whose solutions are    @xmath92    as we expected , the limit @xmath59 of each solution is the inverse critical temperature    @xmath93      in this section we determine the effect of an external magnetic field applied to the system .",
    "the new potential has to take into account the magnetic interaction by the term    @xmath94    so the new potential is    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is given in .",
    "the new free energy is therefore    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is given in .",
    "@xmath99 is plotted in figure [ fig_fh ] .    in order to find out the magnetization we have to minimize @xmath99 with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "we start by solving the following equation    @xmath100    whose solution is    @xmath101    then we confront @xmath102 with @xmath103 if @xmath104 , or with @xmath105 if @xmath106 .",
    "this can be easily made by introducing the quantity    @xmath107    respectively if @xmath108 .",
    "the root gives a sort of pseudo - critical temperature @xmath109 which separates two different analytic forms of the magnetization    @xmath110    ) as @xmath104 ( left ) , and as @xmath106 ( right ) .",

    "we observe that the presence of the external field breaks the symmetry of the system , but does not eliminate the phase transition meant as the presence of a nonanalyticity in the thermodynamic function .",
    "this is not surprising , and it is due to the fact that the phase transition is of the first order , and not continuous .",
    "the solution of the classical mean - field ising model is by means of the mean - field theory and it is a paradigmatic example in literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we revisited it enlightening how it lets to separate the contribution of the potential from the entropy in the free energy at fixed magnetization , showing as they compete in order to entail the classical second order phase transition occurring in this model .",
    "the potential is as follows    @xmath115    where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and the factor @xmath118 is introduced in order to guarantee the intensivity of the potential per degree of freedom .",
    "following the same method already used to solve the model in section [ skeleton ] , we introduce the positive integer @xmath60 which labels the subsets of the configuration space @xmath63 at constant magnetization @xmath67 whose elements have @xmath60 positive spins .",
    "@xmath119 can be easily written as a function of @xmath60 because the interaction among the spins is  all with all ",
    "@xmath120    since @xmath60 is linked to the magnetization by the relation @xmath68 , the potential can be expressed as a function of @xmath67    @xmath121    then , as @xmath59 we can made the substitution @xmath122 where @xmath123 $ ] is a continuous real variable , getting finally    @xmath124    the entropy is the same of the model in section [ skeleton ] already found out in ( [ skel_sm ] ) .",
    "so the free energy results to be    @xmath125    @xmath5 is plotted in figure [ ising_plotfm ] .    in order to find out the spontaneous magnetization we have to differentiate @xmath5 with respect to @xmath2 and sets to zero",

    "ii , and because it is well known in literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this section we add another example of a mean - field model solvable in the same way applied in previous sections .",
    "it is the model introduced by berlin and kac @xcite , and also known as the _",
    "spherical model_. it approximates the feature of the ising model by substituting the discrete classical spin variables @xmath131 with the continuous real @xmath10 , and constrained them on a @xmath7-sphere of radius @xmath132 , where @xmath7 is the number od degrees of freedom .",
    "such an @xmath7-sphere contains the lattice sites of the ising model if @xmath116 .",
    "the potential is the same of the ising model    @xmath133    where the sum is extended up all the couples of variables because we consider only the ferromagnetic mean - field version , and so we also set @xmath134 .",

    "in this article we have introduced a classical spin model showing a first order @xmath0-symmetry breaking phase transition .",

    "the difference between the model here introduced and the mean - field ising model is the type of phase transition : first order in the former , continuous in the latter .",
    "this is due to the discontinuous and continuous behavior of @xmath151 in the former and in the latter model , respectively .",
    "the double - wellness of the potential opposes to the concavity of the entropy of configuration space in determining the shape of the free energy @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , the competition between these two shapes takes place giving rise to a double - well @xmath153 or a convex @xmath153 depending on the value of the temperature @xmath1 : if @xmath33 then the shape of the potential wins and so the symmetry is broken , conversely if @xmath37 then the shape of the entropy wins and so the symmetry remains unbroken @xcite .",
    "this analysis has been possible due to the fact that the potential can be written as a function of @xmath2 , more generally the order parameter . in this way",
    "the tendency to the symmetry breaking induced by the double - well potential and the tendency to leave unbroken the symmetry by the entropy of configuration space have been able to be separated .",
    "we think that this mechanism has good probabilities to be the general one acting whenever a symmetry breaking phase transition occurs , but we have to take into account that the potential of the model studied in this paper are infinite - range .",
    "this is not the most general case occurring in general physical systems , especially in classical physics",
    ". nevertheless , there may be the way to generalize the mechanism to finite - range systems .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the most elementary model that we know with a first order @xmath0-symmetry breaking phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is a classical spin model with potential energy assuming only two values , which despite its dramatic simplicity reproduces all the characteristic features of a first order symmetry breaking phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> its aim is not to reproduce anyway some physical systems , but to enlighten the mechanics at the deep origin of a phase transition of any system . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the model as elementary in this sense . indeed , it reveals in the most evident way how the boltzmann factor competes with the entropic factor in order to generate the phase transition by varying the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the paper ends revisiting the solutions of the ising model and the spherical model ( berlin - kac ) in the mean - field version which show the same picture of the model introduced in this paper , but extended to continuous phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> a limit of this analysis is that all the three models here considered satisfies the strong constraint of having the potential expressible as a function of the magnetization , thus they belong to the class of infinite - range systems . </S>",
    "<S> anyway , we hope that this study may be helpful in finding out the general sufficiency conditions under which a potential can entail a phase transition in a general physical system also in the finite - range case . </S>"
