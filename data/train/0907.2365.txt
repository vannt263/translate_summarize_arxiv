    "the unscreened , long - range coulomb interaction was argued @xcite to be responsible for a plenty of unusual physical properties , including the logarithmic velocity renormalization @xcite , the logarithmic specific heat correction @xcite , the presence of quantum critical point @xcite , and the marginal fermi liquid quasiparticle lifetime @xcite .",
    "when the unscreened coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong , the semimetal ground state of graphene may no longer be stable .",
    "there exists an interesting possibility that the massless dirac quasiparticles and quasiholes are bound into pairs through the attractive coulomb interaction between them . as a consequence ,",
    "the massless dirac fermions acquire a finite mass and the ground state of graphene becomes insulating .",
    "this semimetal - insulator transition is usually called excitonic instability in the literature @xcite .",
    "it can be identified as the non - perturbative phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking conventionally studied in the context of particle physics @xcite .",
    "both dyson - schwinger equation @xcite and lattice simulation approaches @xcite found that such excitonic instability occurs only when the fermion flavor is less than a critical value @xmath2 and the coulomb strength is larger than a critical value @xmath3 .",
    "if we fix the physical fermion flavor @xmath4 , then the semimetal - insulator transition happens at a single critical point @xmath3 .",
    "the effective coupling parameter of coulomb interaction can be defined as @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the dielectric constant and @xmath7 being the effective velocity . in the clean limit , the physical magnitude of this parameter is around 3 or 4 for graphene in vacuum . in the same limit , we found by solving gap equation to the leading order of @xmath8 expansion that the critical strength @xmath9 @xcite . using analogous gap equation approach ,",
    "the critical coupling is found to be @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively in ref .",

    "once a fermion mass gap is generated , the low - energy properties of graphene fundamentally change . below the energy scale set by the fermion gap",
    ", the density of states of fermions is substantially suppressed , which would produce important consequences .",
    "it is interesting to study some observable physical quantities those can serve as signatures for the existence of excitonic instability .",
    "the effects of dynamical fermion gap have been discussed by several authors @xcite . in this paper , we calculate the specific heat and susceptibility of dirac fermions and other low - energy excitations in both semimetal and excitonic insulator phases .",
    "these quantities can be compared with experimental results and hence may help to understand the physical consequence of excitonic instability .    in the semimetal phase ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is not strong enough to trigger excitonic pairing instability , but it is strong enough to produce unusual properties .",
    "as found by vafek @xcite , the long - range coulomb interaction gives rise to logarithmic @xmath14-dependence of fermion specific heat , which is clearly not behavior of normal fermi liquid . in this paper , we re - derive the same qualitative result by a different method .",
    "we also calculate the susceptibility of massless dirac fermions and show that it also exhibits logarithmic @xmath14-dependence due to long - range coulomb interaction .    in the insulator phase ,",
    "the fermion density of states is suppressed by the excitonic gap .",
    "intuitively , the specific heat and susceptibility of dirac fermions should drop significantly from their corresponding magnitudes in the semimetal phase .",
    "our explicit computations will show that this is true .",
    "however , the massive dirac fermions are not the true low - lying elementary excitations in the insulating state . at the low energy regime ,",
    "the only degree of freedom is the massless goldstone boson which originates from the dynamical breaking of continuous chiral symmetry .",
    "the goldstone bosons make dominant contribution to the total specific heat at low temperature , but make no contribution to the total susceptibility .    in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we set up the hamiltonian of the system and define the physical quantities in which we are interested .",
    "we calculate the free energy , specific heat and susceptibility in section [ sec : clean ] .",
    "we finally summarize the results and discuss some relevant problems in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of massless dirac fermions in single layer graphene is given by @xmath15 where the coulomb interaction potential @xcite is @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , it is convenient to define a dimensionless coulomb coupling as @xmath18 .",
    "usually , dirac fermion in two spatial dimensions is described by two - component spinor field whose @xmath19 representation can be formulated by pauli matrices @xmath20 .",
    "however , it is not possible to define a @xmath19 matrix that anticommutes with all these matrices .",

    "the total hamiltonian preserves a continuous u(2n ) chiral symmetry @xmath30 .",
    "the mass term generated by excitonic pairing will break this global chiral symmetry dynamically to subgroup @xmath31 .",
    "meanwhile , according to the goldstone theorem , there appear massless goldstone bosons due to the breaking of continuous chiral symmetry .",
    "these bosons are the only gapless excitations in the symmetry broken phase and hence play an important role in determining the low - energy behaviors of the system .",
    "although the physical fermion flavor is actually @xmath4 , in the following we consider a general @xmath32 in order to perform @xmath8 expansion . for convenience , we work in units where @xmath33 throughout the paper .",
    "the electronic structure of graphene is very special in that the @xmath34-conduction bands and @xmath35-valence bands touch at two inequivalent @xmath36 points .",
    "this is the reason why the low - energy fermionic excitations have a linear dispersion .",
    "when the strong , long - range coulomb interaction opens an excitonic gap at the dirac point , the chiral symmetry of total hamiltonian is broken , resembling the non - perturbative phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qed@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was first proposed in graphene by khveshchenko @xcite and has been extensively studied @xcite in the following years .",

    "they also argued that the massive phase exhibits much more interesting behavior than the massless one .",
    "the effect of fermion gap on quasiparticle lifetime and spectral function was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this kind of excitonic instability may also exist in other correlated electron systems than graphene .",
    "for instance , it was suggested by one of the authors that such instability can provide a qualitative understanding on the field - induced thermal metal - insulator transition observed in the vortex state of high temperature cuprate superconductor @xcite .    in this paper , we calculate the specific heat and susceptibility by including the effect of coulomb interaction in both the semimetal and insulator phases .",

    "technically , we will follow the procedures utilized in the paper of kaul and sachdev @xcite . in this framework , all propagators and correlation functions are written in the matsubara imaginary time formalism .    at finite temperature ,",
    "the fermion propagator is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fermion frequency .",
    "although generally the excitonic fermion gap should depend on momentum , energy , and temperature , we assume a constant mass gap @xmath40 throughout the paper to simplify calculations .    the bare coulomb interaction function is simply @xmath41 in an interacting electron gas , the collective excitations screen the bare coulomb interaction and convert @xmath42 to @xmath43 where the polarization function @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 } { k^2(q+k)^{2}},\\ ] ] with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "this implies that , within the @xmath8 expansion , the next - to - leading order contribution could be neglected since it is much less than the leading order contribution .",
    "it is reasonable to speculate that higher order corrections in @xmath8 expansion are also suppressed by the dynamical fermion mass . in the semimetal phase",
    ", there is no such suppressing effect , so higher order corrections might be important . as shown in the context , the analytical calculation of next - to - leading order correction is already very complicated , including higher order corrections will make analytical calculation intractable .",
