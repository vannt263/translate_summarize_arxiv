    "a combined @xmath21 grayscale image centered on the stellar overdensity ( upper left ) reveals no obvious object , however , by selecting only the objects classified by the sdss pipeline as blue stars ( @xmath22 ) , a flattened stellar overdensity is readily visible in the photometric data ( middle and bottom left panels ) .",
    "a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of all stars in the central region reveals a clear main sequence turn - off and sub - giant branch , as well as what appear to be a red clump and sparse horizontal and red giant branches ( right panels ) .",
    "the cmd bears some resemblance to those of intermediate - metallicity globular clusters , but the satellite s seemingly irregular and broken morphology with distinct blobs and sub - clumps leaves its precise nature open to question .",
    "it is not even clear that it is a single object .",
    "accordingly , we obtained deeper follow - up observations with the suprime - cam mosaic imager  @xcite on the subaru telescope  @xcite .",
    "data were gathered on 2006 may 26 ( ut ) , using two pointings to cover the stellar overdensity ( upper left panel of figure  [ fig : uma_disc ] ) . each pointing",
    "was observed in @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands ( for ease of calibration with sdss data ) in a 3-exposure dither to cover the gaps between ccds .",
    "each exposure was 240s , for 12 minutes of exposure time in each band .",
    "unfortunately , several exposures of the western pointing were affected by problems with vignetting and tracking , so that only single @xmath23 and @xmath24 exposures of this area were usable .",
    "the data were processed using a general purpose pipeline modified for subaru reductions .",
    "images were debiased and trimmed , and then flatfielded and gain - corrected to a common internal system using clipped median stacks of nightly twilight flats .",
    "aperture photometry from these processed images was then bootstrap calibrated onto the sdss photometric system .",
    "the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : uma_disc2 ] shows a deep cmd derived from our subaru imaging .",
    "a densely populated upper main sequence and sub - giant branch are now clearly discernible , though with only a truncated red giant branch and possible horizontal branch because of saturation in the subaru data brighter than @xmath25 .",
    "the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : uma_disc2 ] shows a background - subtracted hess diagram of the object . the solid gray line that wraps around the object s main sequence and sub - giant branch in the upper left panel",
    "is used to select members .",
    "the density contours derived from the spatial distribution of these stars are shown in the lower left panel .",
    "the central parts of the object break up into three distinct clumps .",
    "these are also visible in the density contours derived from the sdss data , using the same color - magnitude selection , giving additional confidence that they are not merely data artifacts .",
    "the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : uma_cmdscluster ] shows a composite cmd of the central parts of the object with the bright stars taken from sdss and the faint ones from subaru .",
    "the width in the upper main sequence far exceeds the observational errors and the expected range in foreground extinction ( @xmath26 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may be caused by a number of factors .",
    "first , there is nebulosity in the field of our @xmath23 band subaru images , suggesting that there may be patchy reddening unresolved on the scale of schlegel et al.s ( 1998 ) maps .",
    "second , the spread could be caused by depth along the line of sight , although the main sequence is nearly vertical near the turn - off and thus a distance spread alone would not reproduce its observed width .",
    "finally , it could be caused by a mix of stellar populations of different metallicity and age .",
    "this last hypothesis is illustrated in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : uma_cmdscluster ] by the overplotting of isochrones of different metallicities and ages from @xcite .",
    "the stellar population is not well - described by a single isochrone , but the data are consistent with a single distance , and an age / metallicity range . judging from the isochrones ,",
    "a reasonable conclusion is that the object is of intermediate metallicity and at least 10 gyrs old .",
    "a subaru @xmath23 band image of what appears to be a central cluster is shown in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : uma_cmdscluster ] .",
    "the image is dominated by turn - off and sub - giant stars ( lower right panel ) . even in the small area of the central cluster",
    ", the main sequence appears to be broader than that of a single population .",
    "given the breadth of the main sequence and turn - off , it is difficult to determine a precise distance to the object . from the overlaid isochrones , we estimate a distance modulus of @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath28 kpc . at that distance",
    ", the angular extent of the object ( @xmath29 ) translates to a size of @xmath1 pc . using the same method described in @xcite",
    ", we estimate its absolute magnitude as @xmath30 , a value consistent with the absence of a significant number of giant stars . based on its size ( which exceeds typical values for faint globular clusters ) , its broad cmd morphology ( which argues against a single stellar population ) , and its extremely low surface brightness",
    ", we conclude that this is most likely a hitherto unknown dsph galaxy .",
    "as it is the second milky way dsph satellite to be discovered in this constellation , we follow convention in naming it ursa major ii ( uma ii ) .",
    "at @xmath2 , uma ii would be the faintest dsph yet discovered .",
    "one might therefore wonder whether uma ii could instead be a large globular cluster with gross tidal distortions . in a globular cluster undergoing tidal disruption ,",
    "the transverse size of the tail does not increase appreciably  @xcite .",
    "thus the diameter of the globular cluster would have to be @xmath31 pc , larger than almost all known globulars .",
    "in addition , the cmd does not resemble that of a single stellar population , as in a typical globular cluster .",
    "if uma ii were a disrupted cluster , the progenitor would likely have had properties more extreme than the largest milky way globular , @xmath32 centauri , itself widely believed to be the nucleus of a dsph  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    yet ,",
    "in its physical properties uma ii does resemble willman  1  a peculiar object also found with sdss  which may be a tidally - disrupted globular cluster  @xcite .",
    "willman  1 s absolute magnitude and half - light radius , @xmath33 and @xmath34 pc  @xcite , are at least a factor of @xmath35 fainter and smaller than the corresponding quantities for uma ii , @xmath36 and @xmath37 pc or @xmath38 pc ( based on the minor axis or azimuthally averaged ) . in the @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 plane , uma ii would lie between willman  1 and the recently discovered low - luminosity milky way dsph satellites ursa major i , botes and canes venatici . with digital surveys like sdss",
    "we are thus probing a new regime of ultra - low surface brightness stellar structures , where  in the absence of kinematic data  the distinction between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies is no longer obvious .",
    "if the thickness of the main sequence is indicative of episodic or extended star formation , then uma ii may once have been much more massive and subsequently suffered disruption .",
    "the isophotes of uma ii are even more distorted and irregular than those of the ursa minor  @xcite or bootes dsphs  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the central cluster , there appear to be two density peaks at ( @xmath41 ) and at ( @xmath42 )",
    ". these may perhaps be just fragments of what was once a regular galaxy .",
    "if uma ii were unbound , the fragments would probably have been completely disrupted by now and would not be detected as a significant stellar overdensity .",
    "but is uma ii gravitationally bound ? we can estimate what mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) would be required for it to be bound using the criterion for tidal disruption of a cluster of particles in a circular orbit : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the enclosed masses of the milky way and uma ii , @xmath46 is the distance of uma ii from the center of the milky way , and @xmath47 is the radius of uma ii . assuming @xmath48 , @xmath49 kpc ( from a heliocentric distance of @xmath50 kpc ) , @xmath51 pc , and @xmath52 ( based on @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , uma ii would require m",
    "/ l @xmath55 to be marginally bound .",
    "the uncertainties in this estimate are substantial  just the approximations inherent in the formula could introduce errors of a factor of @xmath56  but it does suggest that , if uma ii is gravitationally bound , its m / l may be higher than that of a typical stellar population . in other words ,",
    "the existence of uma ii as a presumably long - lived , distinct object could imply a higher m / l than would be expected in a system without dark matter .",
    "uma ii is found in a busy area of sky , as shown in figure  [ fig : busy ] .",
    "uma ii lies on the great circle of the `` orphan stream '' , a @xmath57 stellar stream discovered in sdss data  @xcite .",
    "the distance to the orphan stream is @xmath0 kpc , comparable to uma ii . the great circle of the orphan stream includes a number of anomalous , young halo globular clusters , particularly palomar 1 and ruprecht 106 .",
    "uma ii also lies close to the association of hi high velocity clouds known as complex a  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "complex a has a distance bracket of 4.0 to 10.1 kpc  @xcite .",
    "although this is much closer than uma ii , nonetheless they may be associated if complex a lies on a different orbital wrap of a mutual progenitor  @xcite .",
    "uma ii could thus be a surviving fragment of a larger progenitor .",
    "we have identified a new companion to the milky way galaxy in the constellation ursa major . based on its size , structure and stellar population , we argue that it is a new dwarf spheroidal galaxy and name it uma ii .",
    "it has a distance of @xmath50 kpc and an absolute magnitude of @xmath2 .",
    "its color - magnitude diagram shows an upper main sequence , turn - off and sub - giant branch , as well as hints of red giant and horizontal branches .",
    "uma ii has a bright central concentration , together with two further clumps .",
    "the irregular nature of the object suggests that it may have undergone disruption .",
    "this is the fourth milky way dsph discovered by sdss in little over a year .",
    "together with the earlier discoveries of ursa major i , canes venatici and botes , this underscores how incomplete our current census actually is .",
    "as sdss covers only @xmath58 of the celestial sphere , crude scaling arguments would suggest that there are tens of missing milky way dsphs .",
    "if true , this would go some way toward resolving the missing satellite issue .",
    "funding for the sdss and sdss - ii has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the national aeronautics and space administration , the japanese monbukagakusho , the max planck society , and the higher education funding council for england.the sdss web site is http://www.sdss.org/.    the sdss is managed by the astrophysical research consortium for the participating institutions .",
