    "the search for alternative cosmologies is presently in vogue .",
    "the leitmotiv is the observational support for an accelerated universe provided by the type ia supernovae ( sne ) experiments at intermediate and high redshifts @xcite .",
    "such observations are consistently indicating that the bulk of energy in the universe is repulsive and appears like a quintessence component , that is , an unknown form of energy ( in addition to the ordinary dark matter ) , probably of primordial origin @xcite . in the current literature",
    "there are many candidates for this negative - pressure dark component , among them : ( i ) a vacuum decaying energy density , or a time varying @xmath0 @xcite , ( ii ) a time varying relic scalar field slowly rolling down its potential @xcite , ( iii ) the so - called  x - matter \" , an extra component simply characterized by an equation of state @xmath14 , where @xmath15 @xcite and ( iv ) models based on the framework of brane - induced gravity @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite ( henceforth paper i ) , we derived the basic expressions for kinematic tests in a quintessence scenario of the type ( i ) above , which has originally been termed deflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "the effective time dependent cosmological term is regarded as a second fluid component with an energy density , @xmath16 , which transfers energy continuously to the material component .",
    "such a scenario has an interesting cosmological history evolving in three stages .",
    "first , an unstable de sitter configuration is supported by the largest value of the decaying vacuum energy density .",
    "this nonsingular state evolves to a quasi - friedmann - roberton - walker ( frw ) vacuum - radiation phase and , subsequently , the universe approaches continuously the present vacuum - dust stage .",
    "the first stage harmonizes the scenario with the cosmological constant problem , while the transition to the second stage solves the horizon and other well - know problems in the same manner as in inflation .",
    "finally , the universe enters in the present accelerated vacuum - dust phase required by the sn ia observations .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that deflation can be described in terms of a scalar field coupled to the fluid component @xcite .",
    "such models are analytic examples of warm inflationary scenarios proposed by berera @xcite where particle production occurs during the evolution . as a consequence , the supercooling process , as well as the subsequent reheating are no more necessary . in this concern , it should be interesting to analyze the generation of the perturbation spectra by comparing the results with the ones recently obtained by taylor and berera for warm inflation @xcite . here",
    ", as there , one may expect a suppression of the tensor - to - scalar ratio perturbations , though a detailed study is necessary in order to have a more definitive conclusion . on the other hand ,",
    "the scalar field in this enlarged framework is also thermally coupled with dark matter , and as such , it can be used to avoid the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "specific examples of exact deflationary models and the underlying thermodynamics has been given by gunzig _",
    "@xcite , and some scalar field motivated descriptions were also investigated in detail by maartens _",
    "_ @xcite and zimdahl @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss more quantitatively how the observations put limits on the free parameters of the deflationary scenario .",
    "we focus our attention on constraints from the angular size of milliarcsecond compact radio sources , and the latest age estimates of globular clusters ( gcs ) , and for completeness we also consider shortly the case for old high redshift galaxies ( ohrgs ) .",
    "next section we set up the basic equations for these models . in section",
    "iii we derive the corresponding constraints for deflationary cosmologies from @xmath17 analysis .",
    "limits from gcs and ohrgs are discussed in section iv .",
    "the main results are summarized in the conclusion section .",
    "let us now consider a class of spacetimes described by the general frw line element ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19   , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are dimensionless comoving coordinates , @xmath23 is the scale factor , and @xmath24 depends on the curvature parameter ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "the later function is defined by one of the following forms : @xmath27 , @xmath20 , @xmath28 , respectively , for open , flat and closed universes .",
    "since the main interest here is related to kinematic tests for deflation , in what follows we consider only the einstein field equations ( efe ) for a nonvacuum pressureless component plus a cosmological @xmath0-term :    @xmath29    @xmath30    where an overdot means time derivative and @xmath31 is the dust energy density .",
    "the effective @xmath32 is a variable dynamic degree of freedom . in our context",
    ", it relaxes to the present value , @xmath33 , according to the deflationary ansatz @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the vacuum density , @xmath36 is the total energy density , @xmath37 is the hubble parameter , @xmath38 is the arbitrary time scale characterizing the deflationary period , and @xmath39 $ ] is a dimensionless parameter of order unity .",
    "deflationary universe models start their evolution with the largest value of the hubble parameter , @xmath40 , for which the phenomenological expression ( 4 ) reduces to @xmath41 so that we have inflation with no matter and radiation components ( @xmath42 ) . at late times",
    "( @xmath43 ) , we see that @xmath44 , as required by the recent observations . therefore , if the deflationary process begins at planck time one has @xmath45s , and since @xmath46s it thus follows that @xmath47 while the remaining terms are of order unity .",
    "such a conclusion does not change appreciably if the planck scale is replaced by the grand or even the electroweak unification scales in accordance to the standard model ( see paper i ) .",
    "this means that to a high degree of accuracy , the scale @xmath48 is unimportant during the vacuum - dust dominated phase so that for all practical purposes the vacuum energy density can be approximated by @xmath49 .",
    "an interesting feature of decaying @xmath0 models is that the temperature dependence on the redshift @xmath50 of the relic radiation , @xmath51 , can be different from the standard prediction , which is deduced assuming an adiabatic expansion . for deflationary universes , the temperature law at the vacuum / dust phase reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at @xmath54 .",
    "this new relation implies that for a given redshift @xmath50 , the temperature of the universe is slightly lower than in the standard photon - conserved scenario . actually",
    ", indirect measurements of @xmath51 at high redshifts @xcite may become one of the most powerful cosmological tests because it may exclude the presence of a cosmological constant or even of any kind of separately conserved quintessence @xcite .    0.1 in",
    "the angular size - redshift relation to a light source of proper size @xmath3 ( assumed free of evolutionary effects ) can be obtained by integrating the spatial part of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath55 and @xmath22 fixed .",
    "one finds @xmath56 in the above expression @xmath57 is the angular - size scale expressed in milliarcseconds ( mas ) @xmath58 where @xmath3 is measured in parsecs ( for compact radio - sources ) .",

    "the above equations show that the predicted value of @xmath17 is completely determined once the values of @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath1 are given .",
    "two points , however , should be stressed before discussing the resulting diagrams .",
    "first of all , the predicted values of @xmath10 and @xmath1 are strongly dependent on the adopted value of @xmath3 . in the absence of a statistical study describing the intrinsic length distribution of the sources ,",
    "we consider here the approach recently discussed by lima and alcaniz @xcite .",
    "more specifically , instead of assuming a given value for the mean projected linear size , we work on the interval @xmath4 pc , i.e. , @xmath64 pc for @xmath65 , or equivalently , @xmath66 mas . in addition , following kellermann @xcite , we also assume that compact radio sources are free of the evolutionary and selection effects that have bedevilled attempts to use extended double radio source in this context ( see , for example , @xcite ) , as they are deeply embedded in active galactic nuclei , and , therefore , their morphology and kinematics do not depend considerably on the changes of the intergalactic medium .",
    "moreover , these sources have typical ages of some tens of years , i.e. , it is reasonable to suppose that a stable population is established , characterized by parameters that do not change with the cosmic epoch @xcite .    0.1 in    in our analysis we consider the angular size data for milliarcsecond radio - sources recently compiled by gurvits _ et al .",
    "this data set , originally composed by 330 sources distributed over a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath67 ) , was reduced to 145 sources with spectral index @xmath68 and total luminosity @xmath69 w / hz in order to minimize any possible dependence of angular size on spectral index and/or linear size on luminosity .",
    "this new sample was distributed into 12 bins with 12 - 13 sources per bin . in order to determine the cosmological parameters @xmath10 and @xmath1",

    "1 we display the binned data of the median angular size plotted against redshift for @xmath75 and several values of @xmath1 . the curve for a static euclidean universe is also shown for comparison ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , euclidean models are strongly deprived by the observational data . in our statistical analysis",
    "presented below , it was implicitly assumed that possible selection effects ( including the resolution angular limit ) are completely under control .",
    "figure 2 shows contours of constant likelihood ( 95@xmath77 and 68@xmath77 ) in the plane @xmath78 for the interval @xmath79 pc .",
    "note that the allowed range for @xmath1 is reasonably large unless the characteristic length is also large ( @xmath80 pc ) . for @xmath81 pc",
    ", the best fit occurs for a closed model with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in the subsequent panels of the same figure",
    "similar analyzes are displayed for @xmath84 pc ( d = 1.6 mas ) , @xmath85 pc ( d = 1.8 mas ) and @xmath86 pc ( d = 2.0 mas ) .",
    "as physically expected , the limits are now more restrictive for the matter density contribution while larger values of @xmath1 are allowed .",
    "it happens because since @xmath87 , for the same data ( @xmath72 ) and larger @xmath3 we need larger @xmath88 and , therefore , smaller ( larger ) values of @xmath10 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "in particular , if we minimize @xmath9 for @xmath3 , @xmath10 , and @xmath1 , we obtain @xmath89 pc ( d = 1.54 mas ) , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 with @xmath92 and 9 degrees of freedom .",
    "such values are also in agreement to the ones recently found by vishwakarma @xcite .",
    "indeed , as explained in paper i , a subclass of the models investigated by him ( @xmath93 ) corresponds to the late stages of our deflationary scenario .",
    "we also remark that although not discussed here , it is possible to determine exactly the influence of the @xmath0-term in the critical redshift @xmath94 at which the angular size takes its minimal value .",
    "however , as shown elsewhere @xcite , the critical redshift can not discriminate between world models since different scenarios may provide the same @xmath94 values .",
    "the main results of this section are summarized in table 1 .    0.1 in",
    "let us now discuss the constraints on deflationary cosmologies related to the expanding age of the universe .",
    "as widely known , a lower bound for this quantity can be estimated in a variety of different ways .",
    "for instance , oswalt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , analyzing the cooling sequence of white dwarf stars found a lower age limit for the galactic disk of 9.5 gyr .",
    "later on , a value of 15.2 @xmath95 3.7 gyr was also determined using radioactive dating of thorium and europium abundances in stars @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "the recent age estimate of an extremely metal - poor star in the halo of our galaxy ( based on the detection of the 385.957 nm line of singly ionized @xmath96u ) indicated an age of 12.5 @xmath95 3 gyr @xcite .",
    "probably , the most important way of estimating a lower limit to the age of the universe is dating the oldest stars in gcs .",
    "such estimates have , however , oscillated considerably since the publication of the statistical parallax measures done by hipparcos .",
    "initially , some studies implied in a lower limit of 9.5 gyr at @xmath97 confidence level ( c.l . ) @xcite , making some authors argue immediately for the end of the age problem @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , subsequent studies @xcite using new statistical parallax measures and updating some stellar model parameters , found 13.2 gyr with a lower limit of 11 gyr at 95@xmath77 c.l .",
    ", as a corrected mean value for age estimates of gcs ( see also @xcite .",
    "this implies that the flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) model is ruled out for @xmath98 , thereby showing that the  age crisis \" is not dead at all since the most recent measurements of @xmath99 point consistently to @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "all these results are also in accordance with recent estimates based on rather different methods for which the ages of the oldest gcs in our galaxy fall on the interval 13.8 - 16.3 gyr @xcite .",
    "the general age - redshift relation for a deflationary universe is ( see paper i ) @xmath101^{1\\over 2}}.\\ ] ] as one may conclude , by fixing the @xmath102 from observations , the limits on the @xmath1 parameter may readily be obtained for some specified values of @xmath10 .",
    "note also that the age parameter depends only on the product of the two quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which are measured from completely different methods .",
    "here we consider @xmath105 gyr as a median value for the most recent estimates of globular clusters , and , following freedman @xcite , we assume @xmath106 . since these quantities ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) are independent , the two errors may be added in quadratures providing @xmath107 , a value very close to some determinations based on sn ia data @xcite . from this analysis",
    "we see that the einstein - de sitter case is off by @xmath108 2 standard deviations .    in fig .",
    "3a we show the dimensionless product @xmath102 as a function of @xmath1 for some values of the density parameter @xmath10 .",
    "horizontal dashed lines indicate @xmath109 of the age parameter for the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 considered here . as should be physically expected , the greater the contribution of the vacuum ( @xmath1 ) the larger the age predicted by the model . for @xmath110 , all models predict @xmath111 regardless of the value of @xmath10 .",
    "as explained in paper i , this critical case corresponds to an expanding universe with constant hubble flow ( @xmath112 ) also termed  coasting cosmology \" @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3b we show the plane @xmath113 for the fixed value of the product @xmath107 ( solid curve ) .",
    "horizontal lines correspond to the observed range @xmath114 @xcite , which is used to fix the limits on the @xmath1 parameter . for this interval",
    "we find @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "for comparison , we also have plotted the curve for an object ( lbds 53w069 ) with 4.0 gyr at @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the estimated age of this radio galaxy does not provide restrictive limits on the @xmath1 parameter , thereby showing that deflationary cosmologies are quite efficient to solve the variant of the age crisis at high-@xmath50 .",
    "these results are also in agreement with those found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the standard and @xmath118cdm models .",
    "we have investigated the observational constraints on deflationary cosmologies provided by the angular size data and age estimates of globular clusters . by considering a sample of 145 milliarcsecond radio - sources recently compiled by gurvits _",
    "@xcite we found that the best fit occurs for a closed model with @xmath11 , @xmath91 ( @xmath119 ) , and a characteristic length of @xmath89 pc ( d = 1.54 mas ) .",
    "as we have seen , angular size measurements from compact radio sources may provide an important test for world models driven by a dark energy component .",
    "we stress , however , that constraints from the angular size redshift relation should be taken with some caution because a statistical analysis describing the intrinsic length distribution of the sources is still lacking .",
    "this aspect should be specially investigated since the recent development of the observational techniques certainly will provide more accurate data of angular size in the near future .",
    "concerning the age constraints , by adopting @xmath120 gyr as a median value for the most recent age estimates of globular clusters and @xmath121 we have showed that deflationary models are very efficient to solve the  already \" classical age of the universe problem , as well as its variant related to old galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "in particular , regardless of the value of @xmath10 , for @xmath116 the class of models studied here provides total ages greater than 14 gyr .",

    "<S> observational constraints to a large class of decaying vacuum cosmologies are derived using the angular size data of compact radio - sources and the latest age estimates of globular clusters . for this class of deflationary @xmath0 models , the present value of the vacuum energy density is quantified by a positive @xmath1 parameter smaller than unity . in the case of milliarcsecond compact radio - sources , we find that the allowed intervals for @xmath1 and the matter density parameter @xmath2 are heavily dependent on the value of the mean projected linear size @xmath3 . for @xmath4 pc , </S>",
