    "reversible and irreversible aspects in addition to further developments on the ed model are presented in a forthcoming paper @xmath5 $ ] . given two probability distributions , how can one define a notion of `` distance '' between them ?",
    "the answer to this question is provided by ig .",
    "information geometry is riemannian geometry applied to probability theory .",
    "as it is shown in @xmath6 , @xmath7 $ ] , the notion of distance between dissimilar probability distributions is quantified by the fisher - rao information metric tensor .",
    "we consider a red model whose microstates span a @xmath8 space labelled by the variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we assume the only testable information pertaining to the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 consists of the expectation values @xmath13 and the variance @xmath14 .",
    "these three expected values define the @xmath15 space of macrostates of the system . our model may be extended to more elaborate systems where higher dimensions are considered . however , for the sake of clarity , we restrict our consideration to this relatively simple case .",
    "a measure of distinguishability among the states of the ed model is achieved by assigning a probability distribution @xmath16 to each macrostate @xmath17 .",
    "the process of assigning a probability distribution to each state provides @xmath18 with a metric structure . specifically , the fisher - rao information metric defined in @xmath19 is a measure of distinguishability among macrostates .",
    "it assigns an ig to the space of states .      consider a hypothetical physical system evolving over a two - dimensional space .",
    "the variables @xmath20 and @xmath12 label the @xmath8 space of microstates of the system .",
    "we assume that all information relevant to the dynamical evolution of the system is contained in the probability distributions .",
    "for this reason , no other information is required .",
    "each macrostate may be thought as a point of a three - dimensional statistical manifold with coordinates given by the numerical values of the expectations @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",

    "me methods allow us to associate a probability distribution @xmath30 to each point in the space of states @xmath31 .",
    "the distribution that best reflects the information contained in the prior distribution @xmath32 updated by the information @xmath33 is obtained by maximizing the relative entropy @xmath34where @xmath35 is the uniform prior probability distribution .",

    "in other words , we assumed that information about correlations between the microvariables need not to be tracked .",
    "this assumption leads to the simplified product rule @xmath45 .",
    "coupled constraints however , would lead to a generalized product rule in @xmath46 and to a metric tensor @xmath47 with non - trivial off - diagonal elements ( covariance terms ) .",
    "correlation terms may be fictitious .",
    "they may arise for instance from coordinate transformations . on the other hand",
    ", correlations may arise from external fields in which the system is immersed . in such situations , correlations between @xmath20  and @xmath48 effectively describe interaction between the microvariables and the external fields .",
    "such generalizations would require more delicate analysis .",
    "we can not determine the evolution of microstates of the system since the available information is insufficient .",
    "not only is the information available insufficient but we also do not know the equation of motion .",
    "in fact there is no standard `` equation of motion '' .",
    "instead we can ask : how close are the two total distributions with parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 ? once the states of the system have been defined , the next step concerns the problem of quantifying the notion of change from the state @xmath17 to the state @xmath51 . a convenient measure of change",
