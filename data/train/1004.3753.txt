    "* ) , and the cumulative outflows from young star clusters @xcite and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "flow collisions can be subject to turbulent motions , the growth of linear and non - linear instabilities in boundary layers , and in some cases a global instability of the shocked gas ( i.e. radiative overstability , * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of these effects leads to complex scenarios for which numerical hydrodynamics has proved to be a useful investigatory tool .",
    "however , in the discretization of the governing equations of hydrodynamics , additional terms are introduced which are purely numerical in origin . depending on the order of the scheme ,",
    "the appearance of these terms acts to disperse or dissipate the solution , and therefore terms such as `` numerical dispersion '' , `` numerical diffusion '' or `` artificial viscosity '' are often used to describe them .",
    "the undesirable effects of numerical diffusion are minimized as one uses higher order schemes , though all schemes are only first order accurate near discontinuites such as shocks ( where flow variables as well as the perpendicular velocity component , @xmath0 , are discontinuous ) and contact discontinuities ( where there is a density and/or temperature jump but @xmath0 is unchanged ) .",
    "contact discontinuities , and interfaces between different fluids , create special problems for multi - dimensional hydrodynamic codes . unlike shocks , which contain a self - steepening mechanism , contact discontinuities spread diffusively during a calculation , and continue to broaden as the calculation progresses ( see e.g.",
    "some schemes employ an algorithm known as a contact discontinuity steepener to limit this diffusion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , their use remains controversial , since the algorithm is based on empirical values with no physical or mathematical basis , and requires some care , since under certain circumstances it can produce incorrect results ( i.e. `` staircasing '' , blondin , private communication ) .",
    "purely numerical effects are most prevalent when there are large density and temperature contrasts .",
    "unfortunately , these frequently occur in practice , as when radiative cooling is effective cold dense regions of gas can form .",
    "such regions are also inherently unstable , and compressed interface layers may be fragmented resulting in cold dense clumps / filaments residing next to hot tenous gas .",
    "when modelling such phenomena , the numerical transfer of heat from hot to cold cells can change the behaviour of the shocked gas .",
    "in particular , hot cells on one side of the contact discontinuity can reduce the net cooling rate of denser gas in adjacent cells on the other side of the contact discontinuity , and vice - versa .",
    "a further concern comes when one derives synthetic emission from the simulation output .",
    "for instance , due to the @xmath1 dependence of _ thermal _ emission , artificial heating caused by numerical conduction can cause dramatic differences in the spectral hardness and the magnitude of the integrated luminosity .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the effects of numerical conduction and viscosity on the dynamics and observables from colliding flows as a function of the density and temperature constrast between the postshock gas . for the purposes of our investigation we have performed hydrodynamic simulations of colliding flows in plane - parallel and cylindrical geometries . in both scenarios the influence of efficient radiative cooling and powerful instabilities",

    "we show that the calculated x - ray emission from the postshock gas is strongly dependent on the parameters of the opposing flows .",

    "a customized unit has been implemented into the flash code for optically thin radiative cooling using the explicit method described in @xcite . an advected scalar variable",
    "is included in the hydrodynamics calculations to distinguish between the flows .      to calculate the intrinsic x - ray emission from the simulation we assume solar abundances and use emissivities for optically thin gas in collisional ionization equilibrium obtained from look - up tables calculated from the mekal plasma code containing 200",
    "logarithmically spaced energy bins in the range 0.1 - 10 kev , and 101 logarithmically spaced temperature bins in the range @xmath16k . the advected scalar is used to separate the x - ray emission contributions from each flow .",
    "we have performed two sets of simulations to examine the effect of numerical conduction on the gas dynamics and the derived x - ray characteristics of colliding flows .",
    "the first scenario is that of colliding plane - parallel flow and the second is of the wind - wind collision in a massive stellar binary system .    in many of the models presented in this work",
    "the postshock gas has a temperature which places it near a local minimum in the cooling function , @xmath17 , at a value of @xmath18 .",
    "this fact can be utilised to determine approximate values for the cooling time , @xmath19 , and the cooling length , @xmath20 , of postshock gas :    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath8 is the postshock gas temperature in k , @xmath23 is the gas velocity in units of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the gas number density in @xmath26 , and @xmath6 the gas density in g  @xmath27 .",

    "the geometry of the colliding flows allows one to define an escape time for postshock flow leaving the system , @xmath29 .",
    "the strength of cooling in these systems can then be characterised by a dimensionless cooling parameter which is the ratio of the cooling time to the postshock flow time @xcite ,    @xmath30    where @xmath23 is the gas velocity in units of @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the binary separation in units of @xmath33 cm , and @xmath34 is the stellar wind mass - loss rate in units of @xmath35 .",
    "values of @xmath36 are representative of adiabatic gas , whereas @xmath37 indicates that the postshock gas is radiative and will cool rapidly . in the following we use the subscripts 1 and 2 to indicate the cooling parameter for the postshock wind  1 and 2 material , respectively .    using the rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions we can estimate the postshock gas temperature , @xmath8 , and a corresponding energy for ( thermal ) x - ray emission from the postshock gas as ,    @xmath38    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      hydrodynamical codes typically allow the user to modify the magnitude of additional diffusion - like terms which act as artificial viscosity in the governing flow equations .",
    "intuitively , one would expect the addition of artificial viscosity to increase the level of heat conduction across a unit area of the interface between cold and hot gas .",
    "however , viscosity also suppresses instabilities , and thus reduces the total area for interactions . whether the total amount of numerical heat conduction increases or decreases with increasing artificial viscosity",
    "will depend on the relative strength of these effects .",
    "low numerical viscosity in model cwb - a results in the growth of instabilities and thus a turbulent wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) .",
    "the inclusion of additional numerical viscosity in model cwb - avisc surpresses the growth of such instabilities , and in comparison to model cwb - a the wcr is much smoother ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model_images ] ) .",
    "the volume occupied by shocked wind 2 material is significantly smaller in model cwb - avisc than in model cwb - a .",
    "there appears to be two reasons for this .",
    "the reduction in volume far downstream of the apex of the wcr is caused by the lack of secondary shocks in this region of the flow , which in model cwb - a result from the intrusion of dense clumps of gas from wind  1 into the shocked wind  2 gas . however , there is also a significant reduction in the width of postshock wind  2 gas at the apex of the wcr which is evidence for the enhanced numerical transport of heat out of the gas by the artificial viscosity .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray calculations for models cwb - a and cwb - avisc reveals that the latter is of lower luminosity and spectral hardness ( see table  [ tab : luminosities ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : model_spectra ] ) .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that in model cwb - a the higher level of interaction between postshock wind 1 and 2 gas ( i.e. slowly moving dense clumps being struck by higher speed , hot , rarefied flow ) involves collisions which heat wind 1 gas to soft x - ray emitting temperatures and also act to heat wind 2 gas , whilst in model cwb - avisc heat is conducted out of the hottest gas near the apex by the increased artificial viscosity .",
    "this point is highlighted by a comparison of the distribution of mass as a function of temperature for models cwb - a and cwb - avisc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : av_mass ] ) . for model cwb - avisc",
    "there is almost three orders of magnitude less mass at @xmath39k compared to model cwb - a .",
    "in addition , the distribution of wind 2 material in the range @xmath40k drops - off more rapidly for model cwb - avisc than for model cwb - a .",
    "these results confirm that i ) the increased surface area for interactions in model cwb - a compared to model cwb - avisc results in collisions which heat additional ( mainly downstream ) wind 2 material to @xmath41k through further shocks while also heating wind  1 material to @xmath42k through friction and enhanced heat conduction ( though the mass - weighted temperature is actually reduced - see below ) , and ii ) enhanced heat conduction near the apex of the wcr reduces the temperature of the wind  2 gas in model cwb - avisc .    in model cwb",
    "- a the instabilities help to re - heat both wind  1 and 2 gas as it flows downstream resulting in recurring spikes in the mass - weighted postshock gas temperature as one moves to larger distances from the shock apex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : av_temp ] ) .",
    "however , despite this additional heating , as the gas flows off the grid the _ mass - weighted _",
    "wind  2 temperature for model cwb - a is in fact lower than that of model cwb - avisc .",
    "this would suggest that although the volume of postshock gas in model cwb - avisc is smaller in size than that of model cwb - a , the enhanced mixing at the cd in model cwb - a produces a lower _ mass - weighted temperature _ than the smooth flow of model cwb - avisc .",
    "this does not , however , lead to a harder flow  2 spectrum from model cwb - avisc , because the hottest wind  2 gas in the models occurs closer to the apex of the wcr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model_spectra ] and table  [ tab : luminosities ] ) . at the apex of the wcr the temperature of postshock wind 2",
    "gas is lower in model cwb - avisc than in model cwb - a , consistent with the expected extra numerical conduction introduced by additional artificial viscosity , which ultimately modifies the gas temperature and pressure .    the wind  1 distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : av_temp ] provide further evidence for enhanced numerical conduction as the wind  1 temperature in model cwb - avisc is clearly higher than in model cwb - a .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the calculations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : av_temp ] a cut of @xmath43k was made , and thus the distributions shown are for mass _ above _ this limit - in model cwb - avisc all postshock wind  1 gas at @xmath44k has an average temperature of @xmath45k whereas in model cwb - a this value is @xmath46k . examining the location of gas at these mean temperatures we see that in model cwb - avisc it resides in a thin layer at the contact discontinuity whereas in model cwb - a the turbulent wcr causes this gas to outline wind - clump interactions as well as highlight the heavily distorted contact discontinuity ( see the wind  1 temperature plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_images ] ) .",
    "although there is more wind  1 gas at @xmath47k in model cwb - a as a result of vigorous mixing ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : av_mass ] ) , in model cwb - avisc heating at the cd via numerical conduction actually causes the _ mass - weighted temperatures _ to be higher , resulting in a slightly harder wind  1 spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model_spectra ] ) .",
    "focusing now on the inferred hard band ( 7 - 10 kev ) luminosity , we have performed a series of simulations with high artificial viscosity and with the wind  1 parameters fixed , but with different parameters for wind  2 , the results of which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr1 ] . at @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) the wind  1 and wind  2 data points from the low and high viscosity calculations correlate well .",
    "however , at @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) the wind  1 points with and without additional viscosity diverge considerably .",
    "this result implies that the effects of numerical conduction are somewhat ( @xmath52 ) to significantly ( @xmath53 ) reduced by the application of additional artificial viscosity when instabilities that otherwise would occur are strongly suppressed , thereby reducing the surface area between flows .",
    "however , the cost of this approach is an unrealistic description of the dynamics occuring in the wcr , which can effect the derived observational characteristics ( i.e. the spectral hardness of the wind 2 emission from wind 2 ) as a result of limiting the presence of smaller scale downstream shocks .",
    "c +   +    c +   +      to assess the effect of the simulation resolution on the dynamics of the wind - wind collision region and the resulting x - ray emission , calculations have been performed with model cwb - a parameters and with cell sizes in the range @xmath54 cm .    at lower resolution",
    "the coarser grid essentially acts like viscosity ; the wavelength of resolvable instabilities is larger and the timescale for the growth of the smallest resolvable instabilities is longer .",
    "this affects the formation of structure on smaller spatial scales as one tends towards lower resolution ( i.e. larger cell sizes ) .",
    "to the contrary , at higher resolution the formation of structure is enhanced and to illustrate this point we show a snapshot of the highest resolution simulation ( model cwb - a+ ; twice the resolution of model cwb - a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_images ] . the dense shell of cold , postshock primary wind fragments into more numerous clumps of smaller scale which as before pass into the supersonic stream of postshock wind  2 gas , forming bow shocks and tails . because of the smaller size of these clumps the timescale for their destruction is shorter .",
    "this may limit the ability of clumps to traverse completely out of the wcr , due to orbital motion , as shown by @xcite . despite the improved simulation resolution , wind  1 gas is still being heated to temperatures well in excess of those expected from the preshock wind velocity .    comparing the integrated 1 - 10 kev luminosities from models cwb -",
    "a and cwb - a+ reveals lower values for the latter simulation ( table  [ tab : luminosities ] ) .",
    "the explanation for this can be found in the spectrum for model cwb - a+ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model_spectra ] ) where we see that the comparative decrease in the integrated luminosities is due to a lower normalization in the wind  1 emission at all energies , and a reduction in soft ( @xmath55kev ) emission from wind  2 . to further examine this point",
    "we have performed a resolution test , the results of which are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : hr1_res ] .",
    "the general trend is for the artificial heating of wind  1 ( by numerical conduction ) to decrease as the resolution increases ( cell size decreases ) . therefore , the increased simulation resolution has the effect of reducing the net emission calculated from wind  1 , and hardening the spectrum from wind  2 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the degree of fragmentation and the size of the clumps is dependent on the adopted resolution .",
    "higher resolution simulations will create smaller clumps and vice - versa .",
    "in many ( if not most ) astrophysical situations , hydrodynamical codes can not simulate the large reynold s number flows that occur in reality .",
    "thus the instabilities are not as small as they should be .",
    "the increasing popularity of sub - grid turbulence models may alleviate this problem ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally we note that magnetic fields / pressure can limit the compression / density contrast of gas in the dense shell , and may set a minimum size of clumps , while also suppressing ablation and yielding longer - living clumps .",
    "the numerical conduction of heat between hot and cold cells is an undesirable side - effect of the approach used to solve the governing equations of fluid flow .",
    "it has implications for a wide range of phenomena , examples of which include :    * colliding flows : the collision of opposing super - sonic flows is a common occurance in scenarios ranging from the formation of molecular clouds @xcite , the interactions of stellar winds from ysos @xcite , and cwbs @xcite where the preshock winds may also be inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "thermal instability and the cooling of gas are of key importance to the early stages of star formation , and numerical heat conduction will have consequences for simulation results . *",
    "expanding bubbles : the expansion of a high pressure bubble which sweeps up colder surrounding material into a dense shell is relevant for wind - blown bubbles around massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and starburst regions @xcite .",
    "numerical conduction at the interface between the hotter gas in the interior of the bubble , snr , or hii region , and the surrounding cold dense shell , leads to the evaporation of material from the shell into the bubble , and will change the emission and dynamics of these objects . * flow - clump interactions :",

    "the x - ray spectra calculated from the colliding plane - parallel flow models presented in   [ subsec : slab_model ] show that large deviations can arise from numerical conduction .",
    "for example , emission from flow  2 in model slab - c is 100 times greater than that in model slab - e .",
    "numerical heat conduction is also seen in the cwb models .",
    "of course , in reality some physical mixing / diffusion may occur . in this work we have not considered thermal electron conduction which , due to the large temperature gradients present in the simulations , may be important .",
    "for instance , the transport of heat across the contact discontinuity by thermal electrons can `` evaporate '' cold dense postshock gas @xcite , affecting the flow dynamics and the derived x - ray emissivities .",
    "however , depending on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field the efficiency of thermal electron conduction may be significantly hindered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , to accurately account for the effect of _ thermal electron _ conduction requires the inclusion of the relevant electron transport physics and magnetic fields in the simulations . with this in mind , it is important also to understand the level at which numerical conduction acts at .",
    "the current investigation has focused on grid - based hydrodynamics ( gh ) , of which there are numerous codes available to the community @xcite .",
    "this choice is in part justified by the finding that gh is considerably better at handling strong shocks , contact discontinuities , and instabilities than sph @xcite , although recent developments to the sph scheme have improved its ability to model these phenomena ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we have presented hydrodynamic models of colliding hypersonic flows with the aim of examining the effects of numerical conduction on the simulation dynamics and the derived x - ray characteristics .",
    "the conduction of heat occurs across flow discontinuities due to diffusive terms introduced in the discretization of the governing flow equations .",
    "a key conclusion from this work is that the magnitude of the numerical heat conduction is strongly related to the density ( and temperature ) contrast between adjacent gas .",
