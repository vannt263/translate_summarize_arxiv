    "a one - parameter family of decreasing domains , @xmath1 , in @xmath2 solves the laplacian growth problem with sink at @xmath3 if the normal velocity , @xmath4 of the boundary @xmath5 is determined by a harmonic green s function , @xmath6 , of @xmath7 as follows .    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the fundamental solution of the laplace equation and @xmath10 determines the suction rate at @xmath11 .",
    "we can also consider @xmath12 for the case of a source @xmath11 where injection occurs , but this problem is stable ( approaching a sphere in the limit ) and is sometimes called the `` backward - time laplacian growth '' .    this is a _ nonlinear _ moving boundary problem , ubiquitous as an ideal model ( or at least , first approximation ) of many growth processes in nature and industry .",
    "we stress that we are considering here the ill - posed zero surface - tension case , where the interface can encounter a cusp .",
    "the zero surface - tension case has attracted wide and growing attention mainly for two reasons ( to be brief ) : ( i ) it has direct connections to many other areas such as classical potential theory , integrable systems , soliton theory , and random matrices ( ii ) it admits a miraculous complete set of explicit exact solutions in the two - dimensional case .",
    "if the domains @xmath7 are bounded , with @xmath10 problem ( [ lg ] ) actually produces a _ shrinking _ boundary . we get a growth process if @xmath7 contains infinity so @xmath13 then solves an _ exterior _ dirichlet problem .",
    "in such a situation , it is common to place the sink at infinity by prescribing asymptotics for @xmath14 so that the flux across neighborhoods of infinity is proportional to @xmath15 . in the two - dimensional case",
    "this can be realized in the laboratory using a _ hele - shaw cell_. two sheets of glass are placed close together with a viscous fluid ( `` oil '' ) filling the void between them",
    ". a small hole is drilled in the center of the top sheet and an inviscid fluid ( `` water '' ) is pumped in at a constant rate",
    ". then problem ( [ lg ] ) serves as an ideal model for the boundary of the growing bubble of water .",
    "the harmonic function @xmath6 , in this case , corresponds to the _ pressure _ in the oil domain . in other physical settings modeled by ( [ lg ] )",
    ", @xmath6 can be a probability , a concentration , an electrostatic field , or a temperature .",
    "because of the huge amount of literature , we are limited to citing an incomplete list of papers . for a list of over 500 references , see @xcite .",
    "we are particularly attracted to this problem by the lack of explicit examples in dimensions higher than two .",
    "the existence , uniqueness , and regularity theory are well - developed in arbitrary dimensions , and in the plane there is an abundance of explicit , exact solutions . in dimensions higher than two , the only examples are a shrinking sphere ( in the case when the `` oil domain '' @xmath7 is bounded ) or the exterior of a homothetically growing ellipsoid ( in the case @xmath7 is unbounded ) .",
    "the obvious explanation for this deficiency of explicit examples is a lack of conformal maps in higher dimensions ( liouville s theorem ) since exact solutions are usually described in terms of a time - dependent conformal map of the domain to the disk .",
    "however , exact solutions can be understood using a different tool from complex analysis , the schwarz function ( see @xcite and section 2 below ) .",
    "the following theorem relates to the work of s. richardson @xcite and was first stated in terms of the schwarz function by r. f. millar @xcite .",
    "also , the discussion given by s. howison @xcite seems to have played an important role in popularizing the use of the schwarz function in studies of laplacian growth .",
    "[ sf ] suppose a one - parameter family of domains @xmath7 has smoothly - changing analytic boundary with schwarz function @xmath16 .",
    "then it is a laplacian growth if and only if @xmath17    the schwarz function is only guaranteed to exist in a vicinity of a given analytic curve , and _ a priori _ the domain of analyticity for its time - derivative is not any better .",
    "thus , it is surprising that for a laplacian growth , @xmath18 coincides with a function analytic throughout @xmath7 except at the singularity prescribed at the `` sink '' .",
    "in other words , we can extract from equation ( [ dsp ] ) the following elegant description of solutions to problem ( [ lg ] ) : _ singularities in @xmath7 of the schwarz function of @xmath19 do not move except for one simple pole stationed at the sink @xmath11 which decreases in strength at the rate @xmath20 .",
    "_ since equation [ dsp ] is given in physical coordinates rather than introducing a uniformized `` mathematical plane '' , s. howison @xcite has called it an _ intrinsic _ description . in recent papers , it is typical to see a combination of the schwarz function and the conformal map used to derive solutions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will review some familiar examples in section 4 and understand them completely in terms of theorem [ sf ] .",
    "the schwarz function has been partially generalized by d. khavinson and h. s. shapiro to higher dimensions by defining a `` schwarz potential '' , a solution of a certain cauchy problem for the laplace equation @xcite . in section 2 , we will review the definition of the schwarz function and the schwarz potential before proving the @xmath21-dimensional version of theorem [ sf ] .",
    "we also give a further generalization to the elliptic growth problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is guided by theorem [ lgsp ] , which identifies , as the main obstacle , the problem of describing ( globally ) the singularities of the schwarz potential . in section 4",
    "we follow the observation made by l. karp that the schwarz potential of four - dimensional , axially - symmetric surfaces can be calculated exactly @xcite .",
    "we give some explicit examples and also describe some examples of elliptic growth . in section 5 ,",
    "we use @xmath0 techniques to understand the schwarz potential s singularity set for a nontrivial example in @xmath2 including the important case @xmath22 . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss the connection to quadrature domains and richardson s theorem .",
    "suppose @xmath23 is a non - singular , real - analytic curve in the plane .",
    "then the schwarz function @xmath24 is the function that is complex - analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath23 and coincides with @xmath25 on @xmath23 ( see @xcite for a full exposition ) .",
    "if @xmath23 is given algebraically as the zero set of a polynomial @xmath26 , we can obtain @xmath24 by making the complex - linear change of variables @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and then solving for @xmath25 in the equation @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , suppose @xmath23 is the curve given algebraically by the solution set of the equation @xmath30 ( `` c . neumann s",
    "oval '' ) .",
    "then changing variables we have @xmath31 .",
    "solving for @xmath25 gives @xmath32 .",
    "suppose @xmath23 is more generally a nonsingular , analytic _ hypersurface _ in @xmath2 , and consider the following cauchy problem posed in the vicinity of @xmath23 .",
    "the solution exists and is unique by the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem .",
    "@xmath33    the solution @xmath34 of the cauchy problem [ cp ] is called the schwarz potential of @xmath23 .",
    "* example : * let @xmath35 be a sphere of radius @xmath36 . when @xmath37 , it is easy to verify that @xmath38 solves the cauchy problem ( [ cp ] ) , and in higher dimensions the schwarz potential is @xmath39 .    in @xmath40 ,",
    "the schwarz function can be directly recovered from the schwarz potential .",
    "consider @xmath41 .",
    "the cauchy - riemann equations for @xmath42 follow from harmonicity of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 on @xmath23 implies @xmath45 on @xmath23 .",
    "this gives a partial generalization of the schwarz function .",
    "the reflection principle associated with the schwarz function does not generalize to higher dimensions by this or any other means , but the schwarz potential retains other desirable properties . in particular , it allows us to generalize theorem [ sf ] to higher dimensions .      the following theorem generalizes thereom [ sf ] .",
    "we consider a family of domains @xmath46 with analytic boundary that also has analytic time - dependence .",
    "such regularity assumption is natural for us since we are in pursuit of explicit , exact solutions .",
    "however , we should mention that analyticity of the boundary is a necessary condition for existence of a classical solution , and moreover for an analytic initial boundary there exists a unique solution remaining analytic with analytic time - dependence for at least some interval of time ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the schwarz potential of the boundary @xmath48 of @xmath7 .",
    "[ lgsp ] if @xmath7 and @xmath47 are as above then @xmath7 solves the laplacian growth problem ( [ lg ] ) if and only if @xmath49 where @xmath21 is the spatial dimension .",
    "in particular , singularities of the schwarz potential in the `` oil domain '' do not depend on time , except for one stationed at the source ( sink ) which does not move but simply changes strength .",
    "_ remark 1 : _ this relates the solution of a `` mathematically - posed '' cauchy problem to that of a `` physically - posed '' dirichlet problem .",
    "_ remark 2 : _ considering the relationship between the schwarz potential and schwarz function , in the case of @xmath37 , the theorem says that @xmath50 which is the content of theorem [ sf ] .",
    "_ remark 3 : _ this is closely related to the celebrated richardson s theorem @xcite .",
    "actually , the connection can be established through the role that the schwarz potential plays in the theory of quadrature domains ( see section [ sec : qd ] ) .",
    "here we are able to give a more elementary proof consisting of two applications of the chain rule .",
    "assume @xmath51 solves the laplacian growth problem .",
    "we will show that for each @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 solve the same cauchy problem .",
    "then by the uniqueness part of the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem , they are identical .",
    "first , we will show that @xmath55 .",
    "consider a point @xmath56 which is on @xmath48 at time @xmath52 .",
    "the chain rule gives @xmath57    on the other hand , by the first piece of cauchy data in ( [ cp ] ) , @xmath58 by the second piece of cauchy data , @xmath59 combining ( [ cauchy1 ] ) and ( [ cauchy2 ] ) with equation ( [ first ] ) gives @xmath60 we are done if we can show that @xmath61 .",
    "given some position , @xmath62 , let @xmath63 assign the value of time precisely when the boundary , @xmath64 , of the growing domain passes @xmath62 .",
    "then by the cauchy data defining the scwharz potential ( [ cp ] ) , @xmath65 .",
    "taking the partial with respect to @xmath66 of the @xmath67 equation gives @xmath68 .",
    "summing these @xmath69 equations together gives @xmath70 since @xmath48 is the level curve @xmath71 , @xmath72 is orthogonal to @xmath48 , and @xmath73 , where @xmath4 is the normal velocity of @xmath48 .",
    "recall , @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 .",
    "substitution into equation ( [ gradt ] ) gives @xmath76 .    by equation ( [ wdot ] ) , @xmath77 , which implies that @xmath78 and @xmath14 are parallel .",
    "so , @xmath79 .",
    "a natural generalization of the laplacian growth problem is to allow a non - constant `` filtration coefficient '' @xmath80 and `` porosity '' @xmath81 .",
    "then instead of laplace s equation the pressure satisfies @xmath82 and should have a singularity at the sink of the same type as the fundamental solution to this elliptic equation .",
    "moreover , the darcy s law determining the boundary velocity becomes @xmath83 . for details , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "physically , this models the problem in a non - homogeneous medium and also relates to the case of hele - shaw cells on curved surfaces ( in the absence of gravity ) studied in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we can formulate an equation similar to equation ( [ ds ] ) that relates the pressure function of an elliptic growth to the time - dependence of the solution to a certain cauchy problem .",

    "the first part of the argument is similar in showing that .",
    "@xmath92 consider a point @xmath56 which is on @xmath48 at time @xmath52 .",

    "multiply both sides by @xmath98 and take the divergence : @xmath99 which , by definition of @xmath87 and @xmath86 , simplifies to @xmath100 as in the proof of theorem [ lgsp ] , @xmath73 , where @xmath4 is the normal velocity of @xmath48 . except now @xmath101 .",
    "thus , @xmath102 .",
    "substitution into equation ( [ gradt2 ] ) gives @xmath103 .    by equation ( [ udot2 ] ) , @xmath104 , which implies that @xmath105 and @xmath14 are parallel .",
    "so , @xmath106 .",
    "let us discuss a special case of the above .",
    "suppose that the problem ( [ q ] ) has a solution @xmath86 that is entire .",
    "let @xmath107 denote @xmath98 , and suppose @xmath107 is also entire .",
    "for instance , @xmath108 and @xmath109 gives @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "when @xmath112 as in this case , the `` elliptic growth '' is just a laplacian growth with a variable - coefficient law governing the boundary velocity .",
    "the problem ( [ cpeg ] ) defining @xmath87 becomes a cauchy problem for laplace s equation with entire data .",
    "this is the realm of the schwarz potential conjecture formulated by khavinson and shapiro :    suppose @xmath87 solves the cauchy problem for laplace s equation posed on a nonsingular analytic surface @xmath23 with real - entire data .",
    "then the singularity set of @xmath87 is contained in the singularity set of the schwarz potential @xmath43 .",
    "the conjecture holds in the plane and has been shown to hold `` generically '' in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "if the conjecture is true , then for the case when @xmath110 , the singularities of @xmath87 are controlled throughout time by those of @xmath43 .",
    "combining this with theorems [ lgsp ] and [ egsp ] implies that , given a solution of the laplacian growth problem ( [ lg ] ) , the exact same evolution can be generated amid an elliptic growth law with @xmath110 by a pressure function having singularities at the same locations as those of @xmath43 .",
    "the singularities may have different time - dependence and be of a different type .",
    "for instance , consider the plane and the simplest laplacian growth of suction from the center of a circle so that at time @xmath52 , the schwarz function is @xmath113 ( a constant rate of suction ) .",
    "let us determine the pressure required to generate the same process when @xmath108 and @xmath114 . to solve for @xmath87",
    ", we notice that @xmath115 is analytic and coincides with @xmath116 on the shrinking circle . since @xmath117 on the boundary , we have @xmath118 .",
    "this is even true off the boundary since both sides are analytic .",
    "the singular terms are @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , in order to generate the same `` movie '' , the pressure must have a fundamental solution type singularity along with a weak `` multi - pole '' at the origin , both diminishing at non - constant rates .",
    "in this section we will understand some explicit solutions in terms of the theorems [ sf ] , [ lgsp ] , and [ egsp ] .",
    "first we review some familiar examples in the plane , where typically a time - dependent conformal map is introduced . instead , we work entirely with the schwarz function and check that theorem [ sf ] is satisfied .",
    "* example 1 : * consider the family of domains @xmath121 with boundary given by the curves @xmath122 with @xmath123 real .",
    "the schwarz function is given by @xmath124 which has a single - valued branch in the interior of the curve for appropriate parameter values @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the only singularities of the schwarz function interior to the curve are a simple pole and a pole of order two at the origin .",
    "given an initial domain from this family we can choose a one - parameter slice of domains so that the simple pole increases ( resp . decreases ) while the pole of order two does not change .",
    "this gives an exact solution to the laplacian growth problem with injection ( resp .",
    "suction ) taking place at the origin . in the case of injection ,",
    "the domain approaches a circle . in the case of suction , the domain develops a cusp in finite time .    instead of just one sink or source @xmath127 with rate @xmath15 , let us extend problem [ lg ] by allowing for multiple sinks and/or sources @xmath128 with suction / injection rates @xmath129 .",
    "this is the formulation of the problem which is often made , for instance , see the excellent exposition @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ lgsp ] carries through without changes so that the time - derivative of the schwarz potential still coincides with @xmath54 .",
    "the only difference is that now there can be multiple time - dependent point - singularities inside @xmath7 .",
    "* example 2 : * we first consider the family of curves mentioned in section 2.1 .",
    "the schwarz function of the boundary is @xmath130 which has two simple poles at @xmath131 each with residue @xmath132 . in order to satisfy the conditions imposed by theorem [ lgsp ] we choose @xmath133 constant .",
    "then we choose @xmath134 to be decreasing ( increasing ) to obtain suction ( injection ) at two sinks ( sources ) . in the case of suction , the oval forms an indentation at the top and bottom and becomes increasingly pinched as the boundary approaches two tangent circles centered at @xmath135 , the positions of the sinks ( see figure [ fig : neumann ] ) .",
    "for the next example , we consider the case of problem ( [ lg ] ) where the `` oil domain '' @xmath7 is unbounded with a sink at infinity .",
    "* example 3 : * we recall the schwarz function for an ellipse given by the solution set of the equation @xmath136 . changing variables we have @xmath137 . solving for @xmath25 gives @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath24 has a square root branch cut along the segment joining the foci @xmath139 , but we are only interested in the exterior of the ellipse , where @xmath24 is free of singularities .",
    "this already guarantees that any evolution of ellipses that has analytic time dependence can be generated by preparing the correct asymptotic pressure conditions to match @xmath140 which is only singular at infinity .",
    "in other words , we can use equation [ dsp ] to work backwards in specifying the pressure condition to generate the given flow .",
    "since there are no finite singularities , we only have to specify the conditions at infinity .",
    "a realistic case is if the asymptotic condition is steady and isotropic : @xmath141 for a constant @xmath69 independent of @xmath52 .",
    "take a homothetic growth with @xmath142 and @xmath143 from some initial ellipse with semi - axes @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "then @xmath144 , and we have @xmath145 , where @xmath146 .",
    "next , we consider axially - symmetric , four - dimensional domains .",
    "this turns out to be simpler than the more physically relevant @xmath148 , and we will see in the next subsection that it is is equivalent to certain cases of elliptic growth in two and three dimensions .",
    "lavi karp @xcite has given a procedure , including several explicit examples , for obtaining the singularities of the schwarz potential for a domain @xmath149 that is the rotation into @xmath147 of a domain in @xmath40 with schwarz function @xmath24 .",
    "we outline here this procedure for finding the schwarz potential @xmath150 .",
    "since @xmath43 solves a cauchy problem for axially symmetric data posed on an axially symmetric hypersurface , with , say @xmath151 as the axis of symmetry , it is a function of two variables .",
    "write @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "what makes @xmath147 convenient to work with is the fact that @xmath154 is a harmonic function of the variables @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "thus , finding @xmath157 is reduced to solving an algebraic cauchy problem in the plane , which can be done in terms of the schwarz function @xmath158 .",
    "the steps for writing this solution are outlined below .",
    "* step 1 : * write @xmath159 . + * step 2 : * find a primitive function @xmath160 for @xmath161 . + * step 3 : * write @xmath162 . then the schwarz potential for @xmath149 is @xmath163 .",
    "one of the examples carried through this procedure in @xcite is the family of `` limacons '' from example @xmath164 .",
    "the result is that the schwarz potential can be expanded about the origin as @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is harmonic and @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 .",
    "we can interpret one - parameter slices of this family as a laplacian growth if we further extend problem [ lg ] to allow for `` multi - poles '' ( see @xcite for a discussion of multi - pole sollutions in the plane ) .",
    "if we want a laplacian growth with just a simple sink then according to the dynamics - of - singularities imposed by theorem [ lgsp ] , we need to choose the time - dependence of @xmath125 and @xmath126 so that the only singularity whose coefficient changes is the fundamental - solution type singularity @xmath170 .",
    "thus , where @xmath171 , @xmath172 are constants , we need to have : @xmath173 unfortunately , solutions @xmath125 and @xmath126 of this system are locally constant so that @xmath174 must then be constant and the whole surface does not move at all .",
    "the other examples of axially symmetric domains considered in @xcite also require introducing multi - poles or even a continuum of singularities , otherwise the conditions imposed by simple sources / sinks leads to a similarly overdetermined system . roughly speaking",
    ", the difficulty is that @xmath161 from step 1 above generally has more singularities than @xmath24 .",
    "thus , if a class of domains in the plane has enough parameters to control the singularities and obtain a laplacian growth , then rotation into @xmath147 introduces more singularities which must be controlled with the same number of parameters .",
    "there are exceptions : we can describe some exact solutions involving a simple source and sink ( no multipoles ) .",
    "consider the hypersurfaces of revolution obtained by rotation from a family of curves whose schwarz functions have two simple poles at @xmath175 ( with not necessarily equal residues ) .",
    "this is a two - parameter family of surfaces ; as parameters , we can take the residues of the schwarz function of the profile curves .",
    "let @xmath149 denote the domain in the plane bounded by the profile curve .",
    "the schwarz function has the form @xmath176 where @xmath177 is analytic in @xmath149 . in what follows",
    ", we will suppress the dependence on @xmath178 and @xmath179 of higher - degree coefficients .",
    "following steps 1 through 3 above , we have @xmath180 @xmath181 where @xmath182 is analytic in @xmath149 .",
    "then for step 2 we need a primitive function for @xmath161 which is @xmath183 where @xmath184 is analytic in @xmath149 .",
    "then for step 3 we have @xmath185 .",
    "if we can vary @xmath178 and @xmath179 in a way that keeps @xmath171 and @xmath172 constant , then the time - derivative of the schwarz function will satisfy the dynamics - of - singularities condition .",
    "this seems at first to be another overdetermined problem , but actually @xmath171 and @xmath172 must be equal ! otherwise , the two branch cuts of @xmath186 and @xmath187 will not cancel eachother outside the interval @xmath188 $ ] , and the schwarz potential will become singular on the surface itself .",
    "this can not happen since the surface has no points ( in @xmath2 ) that are characteristic for the cauchy problem .",
    "therefore , since @xmath171 and @xmath172 are equal , we spend only one dimension of our parameter space controlling the `` non - physical '' segment of singularities .",
    "this leaves freedom for the `` physical '' singularities to move , at least locally , along a one - dimensional submanifold of parameters .",
    "figure [ r4 ] shows the evolution of the profile curve for a typical example that can be obtained in this way .",
    "we omit the cumbersome formulae for the time - dependence of coefficients in the algebraic description of such exact solutions .",
    "the two - parameter family of hypersurfaces from which they are selected can be described by the solution set of : @xmath189 @xmath190     with injection at one point and suction at another .",
    "the initial curve is plotted in bold . ]",
    "similarly , one can obtain examples where the schwarz function has three or more simple poles . again",
    "the suction / injection rates will have to occur in a prescribed way or else the time - derivative of the schwarz potential will have singular segments which are difficult to interpret physically .    _",
    "remark : _ the rigidity of the inter - dependence of injection / suction rates in the above example is made less severe by the fact that the initial and final domains only depend on the total quantities injected and removed at the source and sink respectively , and they are independent of the rates and order of work of the source and sink ( see @xcite : the proof extends word for word to higher dimensions ) . thus , injection and suction can happen in any manner , say one at a time , and we will lose the `` movie '' but retain the final domain .    in the next section we will be interested in examples that correspond to axially symmetric surfaces that do not intersect the axis of symmetry .",
    "for instance , to generate a torus , we can choose the profile curve to be a circle of radius @xmath191 and center @xmath192 , @xmath193 . the schwarz function is @xmath194 .",
    "step 1 gives @xmath195 .",
    "step 2 gives @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is analytic .",
    "step 3 gives @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is free of singularities .",
    "finally , the singular part of @xmath157 is @xmath200 .",
    "this calculation for the schwarz potential of the four - dimensional torus was carried out in @xcite and discussed in connection with a classical mean - value - property for polyharmonic functions .",
    "examples of axially - symmetric , four - dimensional laplacian growth also solve certain elliptic growth problems in two and three dimensions .",
    "the two - dimensional profile solves the planar elliptic growth problem where the filtration coefficient @xmath201 is constant , and the porosity @xmath202 .",
    "indeed , we can check that theorem [ egsp ] is satisfied .",
    "the schwarz potential @xmath157 , reduced to two variables , satisfies the equation @xmath203 .",
    "since @xmath204 , then @xmath205 solves the cauchy problem    @xmath206    with @xmath207 solving the poisson equation @xmath208 .",

    "<S> we give an elementary proof that the same holds in any number of dimensions for the schwarz potential , introduced by d. khavinson and h. s. shapiro @xcite ( 1989 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a generalization is also given for the so - called `` elliptic growth '' problem by defining a generalized schwarz potential .    </S>",
    "<S> new exact solutions are constructed , and we solve inverse problems of describing the driving singularities of a given flow . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , by example , how @xmath0-techniques can be used to locate the singularity set of the schwarz potential . </S>",
    "<S> one of our methods is to prolong available local extension theorems by constructing `` globalizing families '' . </S>",
    "<S> we make three conjectures in potential theory relating to our investigation . </S>"
