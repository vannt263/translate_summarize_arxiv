    "spin glasses are disordered , and partially frustrated magnetic systems with a critical ( freezing ) temperature @xmath0 , below which the spins are frozen in random orientations without a conventional order@xcite .",
    "diluted alloys of transition - metal impurities in a noble - metal matrix ( e.g. , _",
    "au_fe , _ ag_mn , and _",
    "cu_mn ) are typical examples , and are known as canonical spin - glasses ( csgs)@xcite .",
    "these systems have been the subject of intense research during the last five decades , and many of their fundamental characteristics are now well understood .",
    "however , some questions still lack a satisfactory answer .    a fundamental , and not yet fully solved problem is the dependence of @xmath0 on the composition of the alloy ; i.e. , how @xmath0 varies , as we change the concentrations ( @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) of magnetic , and non magnetic impurities .",
    "valuable experimental data have been collected by several researchers@xcite ; yet , the observed behaviour is only partially understood . a primary question is : can we derive a formula that describes the experiments coherently , in a quantitative manner ?",
    "this is , actually , a two - fold problem . in csgs ,",
    "the spins are coupled by means of the conduction electrons .",
    "the exact form of this interaction , as a function of the distance between the spins ( @xmath6 ) , is only known for the ideal case of two spins in an otherwise clean metal .",
    "there , it is given by the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida@xcite ( rkky ) formula @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the fermi wave - vector .",
    "randomly distributed , magnetic and non - magnetic impurities scatter the conduction electrons , and therefore , modify this @xmath9 dependence .",
    "thus , in order to describe @xmath10 one needs to solve two general problems : ( 1 ) the form of the effective couplings @xmath1 in metals with impurities , and ( 2 ) the functional form @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the effective interaction , in the presence of disorder , has been studied by many authors@xcite .",
    "analytical results have been obtained in some asymptotic limits , which can be employed with the assistance of interpolating forms .",
    "further advances , within analytical methods , seem quite challenging .",
    "the present work focuses on solving the second problem ; finding the functional dependence @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "perhaps the best known approximation to @xmath11 $ ] is @xmath12 , from the edwards - anderson model@xcite , and also derived by sherrington@xcite , neglecting the correlations between the orientation of the spins and the couplings .",
    "here on , i shall refer to this result as mff ( mean - field - formula ) ; similarly , the general term mean - field will be abbreviated as mf . this same dependence ( to within a multiplicative constant )",
    "was obtained by thouless , anderson , and palmer ( tap ) , following a rather different approach@xcite .",
    "they extracted @xmath0 from the eigenvalue distribution of the interaction matrix @xmath1 , corrected by a reaction field , under the assumption of gaussian fluctuations in the local fields .",
    "the mff possesses some desired features .",
    "it gives a finite @xmath0 in the limit of infinite range interactions ( clean limit ) , and , if the shortest distance between spins is taken as @xmath13 ( proportional to the typical distance ) , one obtains @xmath14 , in agreement with scaling arguments .",
    "however , there has been no conclusive evidence to show that the mff can also account for dirt - related effects , using physical parameters with realistic values .",
    "moreover , neither the absence of local correlations between the spins , nor the statistical independence of spins and couplings seems to be justified@xcite .",
    "the assumption of gaussian fluctuations in metallic spin - glasses is also debatable@xcite .",
    "a different phenomenological relation @xmath15 was proposed by shegelski and geldart ( sg)@xcite ( see next section ) , and with it they obtained an overall acceptable fit to the experiments , at moderate @xmath4 .",
    "they could also describe , in a semi - quantitative manner , the changes in @xmath0 caused by the addition of non - magnetic impurities .",
    "unfortunately , this formula predicts an asymptotic dependence @xmath16 , when @xmath17 , and an infinite @xmath0 in the clean limit ( in the absence of electron mean - free - path effects ) .    despite the continuous research in this field@xcite ,",
    "the theoretical and quantitative description of experiments remain as challenging as two decades before .",
    "simplified spin models exist that allow more exact solutions ; but these can not be generalized to realistic interactions .",
    "since the exact form of the electron - mediated ( rkky ) interaction is only known in some asymptotic limits , it is difficult to judge whether the discrepancies between experiments and theory are only due to the mf approximations , or also due to the chosen interpolations for @xmath1 . another reason to look for solutions beyond the mff is that fluctuations are very important at the critical point , and therefore , we may expect ( perhaps large ) deviations from the mf predictions .",
    "in fact , the relevant number of spatial dimensions in csgs is @xmath18 , which is rather close to the lower critical dimension ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the upper critical dimension ( where the standard mf - approximation becomes exact ) is @xmath20@xcite .    in this paper , an alternative equation for the freezing temperature in metallic spin - glasses",
    "is derived .",
    "first , it is obtained as a functional of the interaction matrix @xmath11 $ ] ( in section [ theo ] ) , where we also discuss its relation to previous approaches .",
    "@xmath11 $ ] is rewritten in terms of the distance dependence of the interaction and the spin - correlations , in sections [ shells ] and [ g ] .",
    "these are the main results of the present work .",
    "the rest of the paper ( sections [ calc ] , and [ exp ] ) is dedicated to the comparison with experiments .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ end ] .",
    "the system of interacting spins is represented by the classical hamiltonian @xmath22 the spins @xmath23s can be ising variables , or vectors of unit length ; the actual length can be included by rescaling the coupling constants .",
    "the @xmath1s are symmetrically distributed around zero , which follows from the sampling of the rkky interaction , according to randomly located spins , at low concentrations .    for @xmath24 just below @xmath0 ,",
    "the self - consistency mf - equations ( for a given spatial arrangement of the impurities ) are @xmath25    where @xmath26 , ( with the boltzmann constant set to @xmath27).when ( [ mf0 ] ) is multiplied by @xmath28 , and averaged over sites , it becomes    @xmath29    the lhs of ( [ mf1 ] ) can be identified as the edwards - anderson ( ea ) order parameter@xcite @xmath30 which is a global quantity , and acquires non vanishing values for @xmath31 . in order to obtain a useful self - consistency equation for @xmath32 , and therefore , a solution for @xmath0 , one needs to express the rhs of ( [ mf1 ] ) in terms of @xmath32 . following the symmetry in the distribution of couplings ,",
    "the average over pairs of sites with @xmath33 satisfy    @xmath34    @xmath35    and @xmath36 for all @xmath24 ; whereas @xmath37    for @xmath31 , and it is zero otherwise .",
    "that ( [ cor1 ] ) and ( [ cor2 ] ) are positive follows from the fact that the apparent randomness of the spin orientations is controlled by the distribution of couplings .",
    "the system minimizes the energy by orienting the spins ( in average ) according to the strongest couplings , as long as the frustration allows it . for symmetric distributions of couplings",
    "( with zero as a dominant mode ) , only about half of the system is frustrated@xcite .",
    "the averages ( [ cor1 ] ) and ( [ cor2 ] ) would be zero only for a fully frustrated system ( not having a finite temperature transition ) .",
    "taking this into account , and noticing that @xmath38 should grow , on average , as @xmath32 , sg proposed@xcite that @xmath39 can be estimated with @xmath40 , to within a constant factor of order one , which reflects the partial frustration .",
    "et al_@xcite pointed out that , for the rkky interaction ( where @xmath41 ) , this estimate diverges in the absence of a long distance cut - off .",
    "the origin of the divergence , in this otherwise - reasonable approach , has not been discussed up to date . as we will see immediately ,",
    "understanding this detail is the key for finding a formula for @xmath0 beyond the mff .",
    "thermal and spacial fluctuations are inherent to thermodynamic systems at @xmath42 , and they play an important role in the vicinity of critical points . for example , in a simple ferromagnetic system ( where all couplings have positive sign ) the probability that two spins point in the same direction decreases as we look at pairs of spins which are further apart . in other words , spin - correlations decay with the distance . if we wish to estimate the double sum in ( [ mf1 ] ) , we must take this into account .",
    "the direction of the spin is rather determined by its closest environment ( strongest couplings ) , and spins further apart have ( on average ) less influence .",
    "the probability of finding a pair of spins ( at sites @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) pointing according to the direct coupling @xmath1 decreases as the distance between the spins becomes larger ( because of the larger cloud of fluctuating spins that lies in between ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to propose a slightly different estimate for the double sum , by introducing the correlation matrix @xmath2 ; i.e. , @xmath45 the values of the matrix terms @xmath2 can not be calculated exactly .",
    "however , their average coarse grained behaviour as a function of the distance ( see later in section [ g ] ) , will be enough for arriving at an analytically amenable formula for @xmath0 .",
    "the factor that multiplies @xmath32 is strictly positive , and independent of the specific realization of the random site distribution . from ( [ mf1 ] ) and ( [ ds ] ) one obtains @xmath46 to within a numerical constant .",
    "the fall - off of the correlations ensures that @xmath47 .",
    "note that since @xmath48 diverges logarithmically , any power - law decay suffices to cancel this singularity .    at this point , we may regard ( [ tgex ] ) as a phenomenological solution to @xmath11 $ ] , as a correction to the sg approach .",
    "however , ( [ tgex ] ) can also be derived following a more fundamental route , by analysing the self - response of the spins on the high-@xmath24 side of the transition .",
    "presume that some spins acquire a non - vanishing , small thermal average .",
    "this perturbation of the paramagnetic state would change the local fields by @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 would affect the neighbouring spins , and these , their neighbours , and so on . according to the linear - response theory ,",
    "this far - reaching effect is given , at any point , in terms of the spin - spin correlations @xmath51 , as @xmath52 now , one should check whether non - vanishing @xmath53s can be maintained by the self - induced fields ; i.e. , whether the system of equations @xmath54 has non - trivial solutions . a non - zero solution , for a number of spins of order @xmath55 , would signal an instability in the paramagnetic phase in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one difficulty with this task is that the matrix @xmath56 ( whose elements decay with the distance ) has localized , and delocalized eigenvectors , whereas the occurrence of the phase transition is related to delocalized states@xcite ( the transition takes place when the mobility edge between delocalized and localized eigenvalues reaches the value of one ) . @xmath57 has the following properties .",
    "( 1 ) the off - diagonal terms have zero average and finite variance @xmath58 .",
    "this derives from the fact that ( for @xmath59 ) each of the correlation terms @xmath2 and the multiplying coupling @xmath60 , correspond to two different spin - pairs ; therefore they are statistically independent .",
    "( 2 ) the diagonal elements are positive , because they are proportional to the effective energy per site @xmath61 ( similar to ( [ cor1 ] ) ) . in thermal equilibrium , @xmath62 .",
    "then , @xmath57 can be written as an average scalar matrix ( @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the identity matrix ) , plus a fluctuation matrix ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66    to get the global information out of this system of equations , it is useful to introduce an ea type of parameter . multiplying ( [ lr ] ) by @xmath53 , and averaging over sites ,    @xmath67",
    "the idea behind this is that localized eigenstates , where only a finite number of spins have non - zero values , will have vanishing @xmath32 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "so , one can screen out those contributions .",
    "the double sum in ( [ ealr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath68 in terms of the eigenvalues ( @xmath69 ) of the rescaled matrix @xmath70 , which are symmetrically distributed around zero , and satisfy @xmath71 for any @xmath55@xcite .",
    "@xmath72 is the square of the projection of the @xmath55-spin vector @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) on the @xmath78-th eigenvector of @xmath79 .",
    "although the exact form of a delocalized eigenvector is unknown , it can be formally substituted in ( [ ealr ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath80 now , the limit @xmath81 is taken ; the second term in the rhs vanishes , and ( [ mfdloc ] ) becomes @xmath82 this gives us again ( [ tgex ] ) , as a condition for @xmath32 acquiring non - zero values ( this time with a known numerical prefactor ) .",
    "thus , provided @xmath83 is a signature of the ordered phase does indicate that a macroscopic number of spins has acquired a non - zero thermal average , which allows us to employ it as a signature of the transition .",
    "the chosen distribution of couplings excludes the possibility of any conventional order .",
    "] , @xmath0 is obtained from the equation @xmath84 this proves the correctness of the ansatz ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "the energy per spin is @xmath85 if @xmath2 is expanded to the lowest order perturbation in @xmath86 ( i.e. , @xmath87^{}_{ij}=\\delta^{}_{ij}-\\beta   j^{}_{ij}$]@xcite , and consequently , @xmath88 ) , ( [ main ] ) reduces to the tap result @xmath89 .",
    "this quantity , as well as @xmath90 , does not depend on the specific configuration@xcite .",
    "sometimes@xcite it is assumed that @xmath91 is also independent of the site @xmath43 , implying that @xmath92 . however , this is not exactly true .",
    "the spin - freezing occurs , as with any other magnetic transition , when the energy gained by ordering overcomes the loss of entropy .",
    "hence , it seems natural that @xmath0 scales with the interaction energy per spin .",
    "the correlations between the couplings and the relative orientation of the spins play a central role in the derivation of ( [ main ] ) . in the simple local - mf - approach ,",
    "the total energy per spin @xmath93 would be zero , if one assumes that the @xmath1s and the orientations of the spins are independent , which leaves no reason for the ordering .",
    "to get around this problem , sherrington@xcite iterated ( [ mf0 ] ) before performing a disorder average ( @xmath94^{}_{\\rm av}$ ] ) , and obtained an energy equivalent to @xmath95^{}_{\\rm av}\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\     & = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\beta\\sum^{}_{j}[j^{2}_{ij}]^{}_{\\rm av } q^2_{}<0\\;. \\label{ave2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equations ( [ ave1 ] ) and ( [ ave2 ] ) give two different values for the energy , but no transparent interpretation of the physics behind this . actually , @xmath96 is the trivial @xmath97 limit ( no correlations ) , and ( [ ave2 ] ) turns out to be the freezing contribution in ( [ ener ] ) after expanding @xmath2 to first order in @xmath86 .",
    "note that in this order of approximation @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , the mff can be rephrased as ( [ main ] ) , with @xmath99 replaced by its high-@xmath24 form , extrapolated down to @xmath0 ; i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "the resulting dependence of @xmath0 on the interaction range is quite different to the one given by ( [ main ] ) .",
    "the bare mf - approximation changes the properties of the matrix @xmath101 , by replacing it with @xmath102 .",
    "actually , @xmath2 , whose values ( and sign ) fluctuate form site to site , is replaced with a trivially self - averaging quantity ( the identity matrix ) . in such situations ,",
    "resorting to averages over different realizations of the disorder could be a choice in order to recover disorder - independent equations .",
    "however , there has not been a unique rule of how to perform this average@xcite , and it is not clear whether the essential features of the actual system are always preserved .",
    "in contrast to thermal averages , the configurational average does not represent a physical process .",
    "the physical system ( with quenched positional disorder ) does not mutate ; it remains in one configuration , yet showing sample - independent properties .",
    "since the free energy ( @xmath103 ) should not depend on the disorder , a suitable implementation of the formal average @xmath104^{}_{\\rm av}$ ] could provide us with more amenable equations that still represent the system correctly@xcite .",
    "however , much care must be taken when performing disorder averages of other physical quantities , or when changing the sequence in which different averages / sums are performed .",
    "the average over disorder does not necessarily make the physics more transparent .",
    "based on the reproducibility and the sharpness of the transition in metallic spin - glasses , it seems natural to think that there could be an analytical approach within which @xmath0 can be obtained from a single configuration@xcite . to this end",
    ", we would have to describe the desired properties in terms of global quantities ( either extensive variables , or their densities ) , so that the fluctuations of the local quantities are washed out by the mere definition of these global quantities .",
    "the present derivation of ( [ main ] ) constitutes an example of such an approach .",
    "in order to put ( [ main ] ) in a more amenable form , the sum over sites is divided into concentric shells of thickness @xmath105 , with @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 is the range of the interaction ( to be specified later ) .",
    "note that , on account of the oscillating sign of the couplings ( originating from the factor @xmath108 ) , every shell contains a good sample of the distribution .",
    "then @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the shortest distance cut - off ( to be specified later ) , and @xmath111 is the number of spins in the layer .",
    "the argument @xmath112 , indicates that the average over sites is constrained to pairs with @xmath113 . as half of the bonds",
    "are frustrated on average@xcite , @xmath114 .",
    "this correlated average is now required , whereas the information available ( see later ) concerns the properties of @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "there are , at least , three arguments supporting the replacement of @xmath117 , with @xmath118 .",
    "first , we should notice that smallest @xmath119s do not always correspond to smallest @xmath120s .",
    "take as an example any pair of spins for which @xmath121 . the coupling @xmath122 is zero , and @xmath2 is most probably different from zero due to indirect correlations .",
    "the opposite example is also possible : @xmath123 , and @xmath124 because of the frustration .",
    "second , one can easily show that @xmath125 becomes identical to @xmath126 , if one replaces @xmath127 with @xmath128 , where the @xmath129s , and @xmath130s are independent random variables taking values @xmath131 with equal probability .",
    "this modification preserves the most important characteristics of the distribution of @xmath127@xcite : ( i ) the random variables @xmath128 are weakly correlated and oscillate between @xmath132 and @xmath133 ; ( ii ) their probability distribution is symmetrical with respect to zero ; and ( iii ) the values around zero are twice as probable as the values close to the extremes . a third fact to consider",
    "is that the correlations between the decays of @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which result from the dimensionality of the space , are not affected as long as the radial integral is done on the product @xmath118 . following the above reasoning , we may expect that @xmath136 is a very good approximation to ( [ i1 ] ) .",
    "experiments and montecarlo simulations@xcite have agreed that the non - linear susceptibility @xmath138 diverges at @xmath0 , and that the spin - glass correlation @xmath139 has a critical falloff @xmath140 , for @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath142 is the typical spin distance .",
    "as the pair correlations @xmath2 are bounded ( i.e. , @xmath143 ) , the double inequality @xmath144 holds for any @xmath112 .",
    "this double inequality implies that @xmath145 also has an infinite range at @xmath146 , and that @xmath147 with @xmath148 whether @xmath149 is a constant ( a true critical exponent ) or @xmath112-dependent , is to be tested by means of montecarlo simulations . from a geometrical perspective , it seems quite reasonable that @xmath150 , to within a numerical factor of order ( and smaller than ) one .",
    "later this will be useful in order to get an analytical expression for @xmath0 .",
    "a finite cusp in the linear susceptibility at @xmath146 is another characteristic of spin glasses ; and it implies that the correlation function @xmath151 has a finite range . the long tail for @xmath145 does not contradict this observation .",
    "@xmath151 does not show a critical decay , because of the fluctuating sign for @xmath2 .",
    "the double sums @xmath152 and @xmath153 grow faster than the system size ( @xmath55 ) , whereas @xmath154 .",
    "a complete solution for @xmath0 , as a function of system parameters , requires an expression for the effective interaction , to be substituted in ( [ cc0 ] ) .",
    "we will shortly review the state of the art on this subject ; then , the interpolation model will be defined .",
    "detailed information can be found in the works of s - g@xcite .",
    "the strength of the effective interaction ( leaving out the oscillating factor ) can be written as @xmath156 where @xmath157 ( for @xmath158-transition metal impurities ) , @xmath159 is the length of the spins , @xmath160 is the fermi energy ( or temperature , remember that we took @xmath161 ) , and @xmath162 is the @xmath163-@xmath164 exchange coupling .",

    "when non - magnetic impurities are added , so that the total resistivity from both types of impurities satisfy @xmath178 , then @xmath179 .",
    "the physics behind this is that when electrons are scattered by non - magnetic impurities , they may not lose the spin - information , which can then be transferred to other spins .",
    "the effective range does not decrease as fast as @xmath180 .",
    "in general @xmath181 .    in the following , the interpolation forms    @xmath182^{1/2}_{}\\\\ \\lambda^{}_{+ } & = &   \\sqrt{\\lambda(\\lambda+\\lambda^{}_{sd})/2}\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    will be used , over the whole range of @xmath112 .",
    "the total mean free path of the electrons can be expressed in terms of the relative concentrations ( @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) of magnetic and non - magnetic impurities , and their respective scattering cross - sections ( @xmath183 , and @xmath184 ) as @xmath185 @xmath186 is the density of sites ( in the fcc lattice , with lattice constant @xmath187 ) .",
    "it will be useful to write the @xmath188s in terms of the resistivities ( @xmath189 , and @xmath190 ) .",

    "a simple analysis , writing @xmath193 in terms of the partial waves phase - shifts ( see @xcite ) , shows that @xmath196 .",
    "a rather special type of effect has been observed in experiments discussed by vier and schultz ( vs)@xcite , related to changes in the concentration ( @xmath197 ) of non - magnetic impurities with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "when @xmath197 is increased ( from zero ) , the interaction becomes more anisotropic ; this results in an initial increase for @xmath0 , which then saturates because of the additional scattering caused by these impurities .",
    "the quantitative description of these effects is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "a simple choice would be to cut off the interaction at an average shortest distance .",
    "however , this arbitrary choice would exclude the possibility of spins occupying nearer neighbours sites ; a situation that , although less probable , has a non - negligible contribution because of the power - law for @xmath199 . a more precise approach",

    "the black square corresponds to the point with only mn - impurities .",
    "if one also takes @xmath224 as a free parameter , one finds no significant changes ; neither in @xmath224 , nor in @xmath229 .",
    "equation ( [ final ] ) describes acceptably the decrease of @xmath0 with the addition of non - magnetic impurities . as indicated by sg @xcite ,",
    "the flattening tendency is a consequence of a slower reduction of the effective range in comparison with the total mean free path .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental points seem to have a tendency toward a total saturation , which is not indicated by the theory .",
    "vs found that their data are well described by the experimental formula @xmath276 with @xmath277 @xmath257 cm , @xmath278 k , and @xmath279 k. one can show that , because of the strong behaviour of the exponential function , the data could also be described by more complicate functions of @xmath231 in its argument . from the perspective of the present theory , using the mean - value theorem , the leading order of ( [ final ] ) in @xmath231 contains exponentials with sub - linear dependences on @xmath231 .",
    "however the non - zero asymptotic value @xmath280 remains unexplained .    to understand this",
    ", we should go back to a very fundamental problem , the mean free path of the electrons .",
    "most intentions of describing the rkky interaction , in the presence of disorder , have been carried out under the assumption that @xmath281 .",
    "also , the standard definition of mean free path is meaningful as long as its calculated value is reasonably larger than the average distance ( @xmath282 ) between the scatterers .",
    "in the high-@xmath231 regime presented in figure ( [ vsrep2 ] ) , values of @xmath283 , and @xmath284 are reached .",
    "when @xmath180 is reduced to values of the order of the distance between scatterers , deviations from the @xmath285 behaviour should be expected .",
    "thus , in order to account for the physics at very high-@xmath231 , we require a ( new ) theory of the rkky interaction beyond the weak scattering regime .",
    "larsen showed @xcite that the saturation of @xmath0 can be reproduced within the mff employing @xmath286^{-1/2}_{}\\label{kane}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath287 , and @xmath288 are material dependent phenomenological constants ) .",
    "certainly , such a functional form would also allow us a perfect fit with ( [ final ] ) , giving @xmath289^{-1/2 } _ { } } _ { } $ ] , to leading order in @xmath231 ( @xmath290 is a mean - value constant ) .",
    "however , although ( [ kane ] ) is qualitatively reasonable , it has only been derived @xcite from the theory of kaneyoshi @xcite , which relies on special assumptions about the energy dependence of the one - electron green function . up to date",
    ", it is not clear whether such a dependence is completely physical or not @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we have derived an equation for the determination of the freezing temperature ( @xmath0 ) in canonical spin - glasses , which gives a coherent description of its concentration dependence , and reproduces multiple experiments well .",
    "the analytical derivation was based on the statistical properties of the couplings and correlations , and did not require an average over disorder .",
    "the price to pay for including the correlations is having an unknown numerical prefactor , related to the specific shape of their distribution ; i.e. , the asymptotic form of the correlations is know analytically , @xmath291 , to within a proportionality constant",
    ". it would be interesting to test the present results with numerical simulations , where correlations can be computed exactly .",
    "since this power - law scaling takes part in the solution for @xmath0 , information about the critical exponent can be obtained from the comparison with experiments .",
    "the ising universality class is found to have the best fit to the data .",
    "this is plausible since the fixed point of the isotropic heisenberg model is unstable with respect to anisotropies in the coupling constants , and the long - ranged interaction in metals is known to have a certain degree of anisotropy .",
    "nevertheless , the sensitivity of the method , to changes in the critical exponent , depends on how one approximates the exponential tail of the interaction .",
    "performing more measurements of @xmath0 , and the electrical resistivity @xmath233 at low concentration of impurities could provide us with more conclusive evidence .",
    "finally , effects beyond the weak scattering regime ( not yet considered ) seem to be important in the quantitative description of the @xmath0 versus @xmath231 dependence , observed in experiments with very dirty samples .",
