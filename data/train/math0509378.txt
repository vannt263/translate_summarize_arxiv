    "the complex of @xmath3-trees @xmath5 is the abstract simplicial complex whose faces correspond to combinatorial types of rooted trees with @xmath6 labelled leaves and all outdegrees congruent to @xmath2 modulo @xmath3 ( and larger than @xmath3 ) .",

    "complexes of @xmath3-trees are a generalization of complexes of trees @xcite defined by hanlon in @xcite .",
    "the complexes @xmath5 are pure simplicial complexes of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "they were shown to be cohen - macaulay by hanlon in @xcite , and shellability was proven independently by trappmann and ziegler @xcite and wachs @xcite .    the symmetric group @xmath10 acts naturally on @xmath5 by permutation of the leaves .",
    "in fact , the complex @xmath5 was introduced by hanlon because of the relation of its top homology group to the @xmath11 homogeneous component of the free lie-@xmath3-algebra with @xmath12 odd generators , both as @xmath10-modules .",
    "lie-@xmath3-algebras are a generalization of lie algebras introduced by hanlon and wachs in @xcite . here , the poset @xmath13 of partitions of @xmath14 with block sizes congruent to @xmath2 modulo @xmath3 enters our picture .",
    "this poset was shown to be cohen - macaulay by bjrner @xcite , and was studied by calderbank , hanlon and robinson in @xcite from the point of view of representation theory . combining the results of @xcite and @xcite one finds that there is a @xmath10-module isomorphism between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , since both are isomorphic to the @xmath11 homogeneous piece of the free lie-@xmath3-algebra with @xmath12 odd generators .",
    "this situation leads to the very natural question of the geometric relationship between the two complexes .",
    "the case @xmath17 is interesting on its own right . the complex @xmath18 ( called _ complex of trees _ ) first appeared in @xcite , in the context of homotopy theory .",
    "its @xmath10-representation theory was studied by robinson and whitehouse @xcite , it figured in geometric group theory in work of vogtmann @xcite , and recently attracted interest again in the study of phylogenetic trees @xcite .",
    "in fact , the order complex of the partition lattice @xmath19 is pl - homeomorphic to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , @xmath20 is obtained from @xmath21 by a sequence of stellar subdivisions @xcite .",

    "in this note we answer this question positively . the direct approach via nested set complexes does not work : other than @xmath22 , @xmath13 is not a lattice , which is an essential condition for the applicability of the theory of nested sets . however , in our context we can introduce analogous concepts that allow us to reduce the problem to a situation that can be handled by the existing theory .    in section [ nsc ]",
    "we review the definition and some of the basic properties of nested set complexes . in section [ combsub ]",
    "we set up the topological framework for subdivisions of simplicial complexes and , with lemma [ lemma ] , state the key tool that will enable us to prove our result . in section [ terza ] the analogies with the classical framework of nested sets",
    "will be put to work , giving explicite subdivisions of each simplex of @xmath5 . by lemma [ lemma ]",
    "we will then be able to construct a subdivision of the whole complex .",
    "although our method is very much tailored to the specific situation of the partition posets , we have kept the notations and the arguments as close as possible to the original theory of nested sets , hoping that this may be a first step towards a generalization of the theory to non - semilattices .",
    "we recall the basic definitions and some useful facts about nested set complexes . for a more extensive account see @xcite .    [ building ]",
    "let @xmath23 be a meet - semilattice .",
    "a * building set * of @xmath23 is a subset @xmath24 such that for any @xmath25 there is an isomorphism @xmath26 \\rightarrow [ \\hat{0},x]\\ ] ] with @xmath27 for @xmath28 .    given a building set @xmath29 , the set @xmath30 is called the set of _ factors of @xmath31 in @xmath29_. we may sometimes drop the suffix and write only @xmath32 if no confusion can arise . + * remarks : *    * building sets can be defined as in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the * nested set complex * of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath29 , denoted @xmath39 , is the abstract simplicial complex of all nonempty @xmath29-nested sets ( with the apex removed , if @xmath23 has a maximal element ) .",

    "suppose that we have a good candidate for @xmath75 .",
    "the linear extension @xmath78 is continuous because it is linear -hence continuous- on every closed simplex .",

    "we rewrite the previous definition , and let @xmath5 denote the abstract simplicial complex of rooted trees on @xmath6 leaves with all outdegrees larger than @xmath2 and congruent to @xmath2 modulo @xmath3 .",
    "the face relations are such that @xmath7 is a face of @xmath8 if @xmath7 is obtained from @xmath8 by a contraction of a set of internal edges .      at this point",
