    "living organisms have used light to observe the properties of materials since the evolutionary development of complex eyes .",
    "however , ultrafast light - control of materials properties has only become feasible after the construction of high - powered lasers in the previous century , and this field has flourished because light - induced processes have the potential to lead to new devices and physical phenomena .",
    "many examples of light - induced phase transitions using near - visible sources have been observed , including discontinuous volume changes in polymer gels,@xcite quasiionic - to - quasineutral transition in organic molecular compounds,@xcite low - spin to high - spin transition in metal organic frameworks,@xcite insulator - to - metal transition in perovskite manganites,@xcite and , remarkably , a transition to a hidden metastable state in @xmath6-tas@xmath7.@xcite all of these examples involve transition to higher - temperature or metastable phases , and the quest to stabilize a phase with less symmetry or more order using light remains elusive .",
    "more recently , intense midinfrared pulses have been used to directly control the dynamical degrees of freedom of the crystal lattice .",
    "such mode - selective vibrational excitations have been used to induce insulator - to - metal transitions@xcite and melting of orbital@xcite and magnetic@xcite orders .",
    "midinfrared excitations have so far not caused transitions to more - ordered phases , although light - induced superconductivity has been claimed in several cuprate compounds and k@xmath4c@xmath8.@xcite however , these claims rely on interpreting the two - dimensional response function @xmath9 measured in the pump - probe experiments as the optical conductivity @xmath10 that is measured in time - domain spectroscopy .",
    "it is unclear whether such an interpretation is justified , especially at low frequencies , when the light - induced state is short - lived , as is the case in these experiments.@xcite in any case , a light - induced transition to a lower - symmetry phase is not observed in any of these experiments .",
    "nonetheless , midinfrared excitation should be an effective tool to drive materials to broken - symmetry phases because selective and coherent excitation of the low - energy structural degrees of freedom should cause minimal dissipation as heat .",
    "the mechanism for mode - selective light - control of materials was proposed by frst _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite this involves exciting an infrared - active phonon mode @xmath11 of a material using an intense light pulse which then causes the lattice to displace along a fully symmetric @xmath12 raman mode coordinate @xmath13 due to a nonlinear coupling @xmath14 between the two modes .",
    "a quantitative microscopic theory of this phenomenon was developed in ref .  , and",
    "calculations based on this theory in combination with a time - resolved x - ray diffraction experiment was used to resolve the midinfrared light  induced changes in the structure of yba@xmath7cu@xmath4o@xmath15.@xcite in addition to the historically discussed cubic order @xmath16 coupling,@xcite subedi _",
    "_  have shown that a sizeable quartic order @xmath17 coupling can occur and studied the dynamics due to such a coupling.@xcite they found that such a quartic coupling exhibits various distinct regimes of dynamics , including transient mode softening and dynamic stabilization in a rectified state .",
    "in contrast to the case of the cubic coupling , the displacement along the @xmath13 coordinate occurs only above a critical pump amplitude threshold for the quartic @xmath17 coupling . a more recent work has reproduced several aspects of the dynamics of this coupling.@xcite unlike the cubic @xmath18 coupling,@xcite the @xmath17 coupling can cause a rectification along a symmetry breaking mode,@xcite but such a light - induced symmetry breaking of a crystal structure has so far not been observed .",
    "it has recently been predicted that ferroelectric polarization can be switched using midinfrared pulses.@xcite in this paper , i extend that work to the paraelectric phase and show that ferroelectricity can also be induced in transition metal oxide paraelectrics .",
    "this relies on a quartic @xmath0 coupling and is a nonperturbative effect that occurs only above a critical pump amplitude . here",
    ", @xmath2 is a high - frequency infrared - active phonon mode that should be externally pumped and @xmath1 is the lowest frequency infrared - active mode that is transverse to the pumped mode .",
    "i find that the sign of the coupling constant @xmath3 is negative in several transition metal oxides , which causes the @xmath1 mode to soften as the @xmath2 mode is externally pumped .",
    "but other quartic order couplings @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 between @xmath2 and the lowest frequency mode @xmath22 that is longitudinal to the pumped mode are larger in magnitude . in the cubic materials , the couplings between @xmath22 and @xmath2 modes are such that the @xmath1 mode may not develop a light - induced dynamical instability . however , i find that the couplings in the longitudinal direction can be effectively reduced by applying strain so that a light - induced ferroelectric state is stabilized by rectification along the @xmath1 coordinate .",
    "i illustrate this theory for the representative case of ktao@xmath4 to show that light - induced ferroelectricity can be generated in the strained version of this material when a pump pulse with an electric field of @xmath2317 mv @xmath5 and pulse duration of 2 ps is used .",
    "interestingly , this value is noticeably smaller than what is expected for the critical pump amplitude due to a @xmath24 coupling.@xcite i find that this reduction is due to the presence of substantial sixth order @xmath25 and @xmath26 couplings .",
    "furthermore , i show that the light - induced rectification can be arbitrarily suppressed by pumping the highest frequency infrared - active mode @xmath2 that is longitudinal to @xmath22 with another weak pulse .",
    "such a control is necessary for applications in devices .",
    "in addition to ktao@xmath4 , i find similar nonlinear couplings in srto@xmath4 , and laalo@xmath4 , and this technique could be generally applied to many transition metal oxide paralectrics .",
    "the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors , nonlinear couplings between different normal mode coordinates , and the coupling between light and pumped infrared mode were all obtained from first principles using density functional calculations as implemented in the vasp software package .",

    "the calculations were done using the relaxed lattice parameters for the cubic structure . for the strained structure , the @xmath32 lattice parameter that minimized the total energy for the given strain was used .",
    "a very small energy convergence criteria of @xmath33 ev was used in the calculations to ensure high numerical accuracy . after relaxing the lattice parameters , i calculated the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors using the frozen phonon method as implemented in the phonopy software package.@xcite after the normal mode coordinates were identified , total energy calculations were performed as a function of the @xmath1 , @xmath22 , and @xmath2 coordinates for values ranging between @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36  with a step of 0.1 @xmath36  to obtain the energy surfaces @xmath37 .",

    "polynomials with anharmonicities up to twentieth order and nonlinearities up to eighth order were needed to ensure accurate fit to the calculated energy surfaces . since the polynomial fits the calculated energy surfaces almost exactly , there are no approximations in the calculations of the nonlinear couplings , beyond that for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the born effective charges were calculated using density functional perturbation theory,@xcite and a larger @xmath38 @xmath31-point grid was used in these calculations .",
    "the calculated born effective charges and phonon mode eigenvectors were used to calculate the mode effective charge @xmath39 that determines the strength of the coupling of light to the pumped phonon mode from first principles.@xcite the coupled equations of motion for the three coordinates were numerically solved using the lsode subroutine of the octave software package.@xcite      phase transitions can not occur at short timescales in nonequilibrium conditions , and any light - induced ferroelectricity will disappear once the external light source vanishes .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to establish an unequivocal protocol for identifying light - induced ferroelectricity .",
    "examining the intensity and phase of the second harmonic generation of the transmitted probe pulse is a convenient way to study ferroelectricity in pump - probe experiments,@xcite and it will be necessary to distinguish between light - induced ferroelectricity and a long  time - period excitation that both generate second harmonics if the probe pulse is shorter than the period of the low - frequency mode .",
    "for the purpose of this discussion , a light - induced ferroelectric state is deemed to have occurred both if the phase of the second harmonics does not change and the intensity of the second harmonics shows at least two peaks over the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) duration of the pump pulse .",
    "therefore , the pump pulse duration should in general be larger than the period of the equilibrium - condition lowest frequency mode to establish light - induced ferroelectricity .",
    "however , this is not a strict condition , and other well - defined criteria could also be specified .",
    "in particular , the lowest frequency oscillations could ( and indeed does ) occur with a larger frequency in the rectified state , and any method ( such as time resolved x - ray diffraction ) that can distinguish oscillations about a displaced position can establish light - induced ferroelectricity .",

    "the paraelectric phase of several @xmath43o@xmath4 perovskite oxides occurs in the cubic structure .",
    "so it is natural to ask if ferroelectricity can be induced in these cubic paraelectrics by a midinfrared excitation of their infrared - active phonon modes .",
    "these materials have five atoms per unit cell , and they thus have four triply degenerate optical phonon modes at the zone center .",
    "factor group analysis shows that three of these modes have the irreducible representation @xmath44 , and these are infrared active .",
    "the remaining one has the irreducible representation @xmath45 and is optically inactive .",
    "ferroelectricity is generally ascribed to a dynamical instability of an infrared - active transverse optic phonon mode . indeed , most ferroelectric materials show a characteristic softening of an infrared transverse optic mode as the transition temperature is approached.@xcite here i investigate if a similar softening and instability of the lowest frequency @xmath46 mode can be achieved by an intense laser - induced excitation of the highest frequency @xmath46 mode in the representative case of cubic ktao@xmath4 .",

    "both these terms give a subtractive contribution to the effective , light - induced frequency of the @xmath1 mode , which hastens its instability as a function of the pump intensity .      for light - induced ferroelectricity to be useful in applications , it is necessary to be able to control the light - induced phase at will in an all - optical setup . in this context",
    ", this means having the capability to switch off the rectification of the @xmath1 mode while the @xmath2 mode is being pumped .",
    "the quartic order odd @xmath136 and @xmath137 couplings in the longitudinal direction can be used to our advantage for this purpose . to investigate this possibility",
    ", i consider an experiment where an overlapping pulse polarized along @xmath40 comes at an arbitrary delay with respect to the rectification - causing pulse that pumps the @xmath2 mode .",
    "i study the resulting dynamics along the @xmath1 coordinate by solving the coupled equations of motion for the four coordinates ( @xmath138 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the equations of motions are obtained from the potential @xmath139 . for computational efficiency ,",
    "i do not consider the full potential @xmath140 spanned by the four coordinates .",

[",

    "note that excitation by only @xmath141 causes rectification of the @xmath1 mode during the fwhm of the pulse [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tetra - dyn](c ) ] .",
    "however , an overlapping excitation by another weak pulse @xmath142 immediately suppresses the light - induced rectification of the @xmath1 mode .",
    "even a weak longitudinal pump is efficient in halting the rectification because the quartic order odd couplings between @xmath1 and @xmath40 modes are much larger than the couplings in the transverse direction .",
    "in summary , i have shown that midinfrared pulses can be used to stabilize nonequilibrium ferroelectricity in strained ktao@xmath4 , which is paraelectric at equilibrium conditions .",
    "this phenomenon relies on a quartic @xmath0 coupling between the highest frequency infrared - active phonon mode @xmath2 and the lowest frequency infared - active mode @xmath1 that is transverse to @xmath2 .",
    "density functional calculations show that the coupling constant @xmath3 is negative , which causes the @xmath1 mode to soften when the @xmath2 mode is externally pumped .",
    "the rectification along the @xmath1 coordinate occurs only above a critical electric field of the pump pulse , demonstrating that this light - induced symmetry breaking is a unique nonperturbative effect .",
    "such a threshold behavior should be observed in experiments to corroborate the predictions made in this paper .",
    "additionally , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 couplings are large , and this makes the rectified regime more accessible .",
    "a first principles calculation of the coupling between light and the @xmath2 mode shows that ferroelectricity can be induced in strained ktao@xmath4 by a midinfrared pulse with a peak electric field of 17 mv @xmath5 and a duration of 2 ps .",
    "furthermore , large odd quartic couplings @xmath136 and @xmath137 between @xmath1 and the highest frequency infrared - active mode @xmath40 longitudinal to @xmath1 makes it possible to arbitrarily switch off the induced ferroelectricity by pumping the @xmath40 mode with another weak pulse .",
    "i find that similar nonlinear interactions exist in srtio@xmath4 and laalo@xmath4 , and this technique could be generally applied to other transition metal oxide paraelectrics .",
    "at a more basic level , i have shown that materials can exhibit various nonlinear interactions between different dynamical degrees of freedom that have hitherto been overlooked .",
    "these interactions enable us to induce and control broken - symmetry phases using light , whose oscillating electric and magnetic fields average to zero by definition . furthermore , i have demonstrated that the nonlinear interactions can be effectively modified by applying strain .",
    "this motivates experiments that combine the disparate fields of nonlinear optics and heterostructuring to achieve materials control in an interesting manner . in a broader perspective , these nonlinear interactions may also be present in other classes of systems , and they might allow us to influence the dynamics of these systems in an unusual way .",

    "only low order nonlinear couplings that are relatively large were discussed in the main text . however ,",
    "if only low order couplings and anharmonicities are considered , the fit to the calculated total - energy surfaces are not satisfactory .",
    "the dynamics of the coordinates with and without using the high order couplings also show large differences , especially at the nonlinear regime .",
