    "cataclysmic variable stars ( see warner 1995 ) give us an opportunity for studying accretion under a range of physical conditions .",
    "for example , the am her class shows an accretion stream interacting with a magnetic dipole that is stationary with respect to the stream . in the intermediate polars ( ips )",
    "the white dwarf is generally spinning much faster than the orbit , and the stream material usually circularises into an accretion disk before threading onto the field .",
    "however , there are signs that at least part of the stream often overflows the accretion disk and interacts directly with the magnetic field ( e.g.  hellier  1989 ) giving a more dynamic and poorly understood stream  field interaction . in at least one system ,",
    "v2400  oph , stream - fed accretion appears to dominate ( buckley  1995 ; hellier &  beardmore 2002 ) .",
    "ao  psc is an ip with a 3.59-hr orbit and an 805-s white - dwarf spin period whose optical and x - ray behavior have been well studied ( e.g.  hellier , cropper &  mason 1991 , hereafter h91 ; hellier  1996 ; taylor  1997 ; williams 2003 ) .",
    "we report here on uv spectroscopy of ao  psc which shows a new type of observational evidence for a stream  field interaction , namely rapidly varying absorption features in uv metal lines .",
    "on 2000 july 15 and 16 we obtained uv observations of ao psc with _ hst _ s stis spectrograph .",
    "the e140 m echelle grating gave 43 orders covering the wavelength range 11401710   , with a dispersion of 0.015    at the 1425-  central wavelength .",
    "the observations were made with the fuv - mama detector in time - tag mode , obtaining data trains lasting 20003000 s from each of eight _ hst _ orbits .",
    "we used the stsdas package inttag in iraf to bin the data train into 40-s exposures .",
    "this gave 474 echelle images which were then reduced to spectra using the stsdas spectral reduction package calstis .    the summed spectrum is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the lines are predominantly in emission , which is unusual among uv spectra of cvs where lines are often strongly in absorption ( e.g.hartley  2002a , b ) or showing p cyg profiles .",
    "we attribute this to the higher x - ray and euv irradiation in a magnetic system .",
    "strong , broad ly@xmath2 absorption can be attributed to the white dwarf , while its narrow emission core is geocoronal emission which is not completely subtracted during pipeline reduction .",
    "in addition the spectrum shows narrow interstellar absorption features which can be used to estimate the column towards ao psc ( e.g.  savage 1991 ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the 1528-  siii absorption line is 0.159   , which , using an oscillator strength of @xmath3 ( morton 1991 ) implies a value of @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "this suggests ( e.g.  gnacinski 2003 ) that @xmath6@xmath7@xmath5 and thus that 0.02 .",
    "the continuum and line fluxes , plus the motion of the lines , all show a prominent variation with the spin cycle ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , as expected in an intermediate polar .",
    "fourier analysis of these quantities ( not shown ) finds no beat - cycle periodicity or other periodicities shorter than the orbital cycle .",
    "the focus of this paper is the behavior over the orbital period .",
    "to reveal this we removed the spin - cycle pulsation by normalizing each spectrum to the continuum .",
    "this process removes most of the pulsation , but is not perfect , resulting in residual spin - cycle `` rippling '' .    the observations , broken up by _ hubble _ s low - earth orbit , consist of two `` visits '' , each with 4 sections of data @xmath80.2 orbital cycles long , separated by gaps of @xmath80.3 cycles .",
    "it so happens that these sections interleave to produce full coverage of ao  psc s orbit .",
    "we thus display the data against orbital phase as though they were taken in a continuous sequence ( though the caveat that they were not should be borne in mind ) .",
    "3 shows the region of spectra from 1230   to 1415  , which contains the weaker lines , and fig .  4 shows the strongest line , 4  ( the color scales are not the same in the two plots ) .",
    "the lines are purely in emission for half an orbital cycle , but the weaker lines are cut into by prominent absorption features for the other half .",
    "is in emission except for blue - shifted absorption around phase 0.73 . to allow the reader to judge the depth of the absorption we show in fig .  5 the data from six orbital phases as line profiles .",
    "the emission moves in velocity , being bluest at phase 0.6 .",
    "the absorption has the same overall velocity trend as the emission , being reddest at phase 0.1 , but has additional , rapid velocity variations .",
    "we should note that , with only 1.5 orbital cycles of data , we can not be certain from this data alone that the absorption repeats with the orbital cycle .",
    "however , the behavior is similar to that of the optical balmer and hei  lines , and of the x - ray continuum , which all show absorption dips occurring at these orbital phases ( h91 ) .    inspection of fig .",
    "2 ( for example near 1330  around orbital phase 0.8 , and near 1400  around orbital phase 0 ) suggests that the absorption also varies over the spin cycle , in that it is often more pronounced at the minima of the spin pulsation . however , this is hard to prove conclusively since it is a transient effect and , as can be deduced from fig .  2 ,",
    "all measures of the line are dominated by a spin - cycle variation .",
    "absorption features owing to winds are common in the uv lines of cataclysmic variables , and the feature seen at phase 0.73 in 4  looks like the classic p  cygni signature .",
    "however , we consider that there are reasons to develop a non - wind model for the absorption features in this star .",
    "\\(1 ) most models suggest that winds are driven from a boundary layer or inner disk . in an intermediate polar such as ao  psc",
    "there is no boundary layer or inner disk ( an 805-s rotator in equilibrium would have an inner disk disrupted out to @xmath82  m ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the absorption in the weaker lines does not give typical p  cygni profiles .",
    "instead the absorption is often in the line core , though there is a bias to the blue .",
    "\\(3 ) the absorption troughs have a lower velocity ( out to @xmath81000  in the weaker lines , 1300  in ) than usual in wind - formed p  cygni lines .",
    "for example 5000  is observed in bz  cam ( prinja  2000 ) , and maximum velocities are often comparable to the white - dwarf escape velocity .        1550 . ]",
    "\\(4 ) the features are generally narrower and show more pronounced variability than in wind - lined systems ( for example , compare with the data shown in prinja  2000 ; hartley  2002a , b , and witherick  2003 ; note that many of these papers display the data after subtracting the mean profile to enhance the variations , which we have not done here ) .",
    "there have been reports of narrow , rapidly varying wind - formed lines , which are attributed to clumps in an outflow ( e.g.hartley  2002a ) , but these are components of broader , deeper p  cygni troughs and thus are unlike those in ao  psc .",
    "it is also worth remarking that the absorption in ao  psc is markedly dependent on orbital phase , being absent for half the cycle .",
    "any deduction from this is unclear , however , since , while there is no particular reason to expect wind - formed lines to depend on orbital phase , and usually they do nt ( e.g.  bz cam ; prinja  2000 ) , there are systems where this is indeed seen ( e.g.  v592  cas ; prinja  2004 ) for reasons that are nt understood .",
    "the fact that the absorption features are so dependent on orbital phase is a strong indicator that they originate in the accretion stream .",
    "this is supported by the presence of x - ray absorption dips lasting for 0.2 in phase , which are coincident with absorption dips in the cores of the optical lines ( h91 ) .",
    "such dips are well known from x - ray binaries ( e.g.  white 1989 ) and are often seen in ips ( hellier , garlick &  mason 1993 ) ; they are attributed to obscuration by disk bulges created where the stream hits the disk .",
    "we thus outline an interpretation of the uv absorption features as originating in the stream .",
    "we note that h91 concluded that the motion of the optical lines was dominated by the stream ( rather than by disk motions ) .",
    "thus maximum redshift will occur when the stream is flowing away , near orbital phase 0.9 .",
    "this coincides with the optical and x - ray dips .    with this phasing",
    "the uv absorption features occur at phases 0.651.15 .",
    "we suggest that they arise from the fraction of the accretion stream that overflows the disk  stream impact . in the standard picture of an ip",
    "the magnetic field is squeezed in the orbital plane by the dense accretion disk .",
    "however , less dense material from stream - overflow will encounter field lines further out than the disk - disruption radius .",
    "the material would have to cross field lines to follow a ballistic trajectory , and so would experience a magnetic drag , as discussed in the diamagnetic blob model of wynn &  king ( 1995 ) .",
    "this interaction would explain why the absorption varies with the spin cycle .",
    "in the standard model for ao  psc s spin pulse , minimum flux occurs when the upper magnetic pole points towards us ( h91 ) .",
    "it will present a magnetic barrier to the inward flow of the stream lasting for approximately a quarter of a spin cycle , hence causing an accumulation of material until the dipole has turned , allowing the material to flow on .",
    "if so , this might explain why the absorption increases in the pulse minimum .",
    "can we also explain the rapid velocity shifts seen in fig .  3 , for example at phase 0.70 where the siiv line moves 1000  to the blue and then back redwards on a timescale much faster than the orbit , but comparable to the spin cycle ?",
    "well , a clue is that it occurs at the specific orbital phase when the stream ",
    "field interaction region is likely to be viewed in front of the white dwarf ( see fig .",
    "an `` accretion gating '' scenario in which the material is either pushed outward , or allowed to flow inward , as the magnetic pole sweeps across the region , would produce motion along the line of sight and hence the rapid changes in doppler shift seen .",
    "the restriction to one part of the orbit , and the sudden onset of the features at phase 0.7 , would then be explained if we only see the absorption features when this region is in front of the white dwarf , which acts as a uv backlight ,    we should also consider the tendancy of the absorption to be blueshifted in that while it is often close to the rest wavelength it is typically 100  bluer than the emission centroid .",
    "note that outside the corotation radius the field will be moving faster than the stream material , and will thus act as a propeller , tending to slow down the material s infall ( which would result in a relative blueshift for the half - orbit during which we see absorption , when the stream is on the near side of the white dwarf ) .",
    "also , both the field s kick and the initial impact with the disk could tend to push the material out of the plane , adding to the blueshift .",
    "given the propeller effect of the field , it is unclear whether the overflowing material ends up accreting , or whether it is slowed down , and perhaps pushed outwards to some extent , so that it ends up merging with the disk ( with an 805-s spin period , any propeller would not be powerful enough to expell material from the system , unlike that proposed for faster rotators such as the 33-s system ae  aqr ) .    if material does accrete while remaining confined in orbital phase it should produce an x - ray modulation at the beat frequency between the orbital and spin periods , since the accretion geometry changes on that cycle ( e.g.  hellier 1991 ; wynn &  king 1992 ) .",
    "beat - cycle modulations are not a usual feature of ao  psc s x - ray lightcurves , but they have been reported in _ exosat",
    "_ data ( hellier 1991 ) .",
    "this suggests that a small amount of the overflow might be accreting on some occassions , but the dominance of the spin pulse in the x - ray lightcurves indicates that most of the accretion flows through the disk .",
    "we have presented evidence that the accretion stream overflows the accretion disk in ao  psc , based on an interpretation of absorption features in the uv lines .",
    "the idea of an overflowing stream was originated as far back as lubow &  shu ( 1976 , see also lubow 1989 ) .",
    "it has since been adopted to explain observational features of several types of cv .",
    "for example , many ips show the x - ray beat periods that are characteristic of disk - overflow accretion ( e.g.  hellier 1991 ; beardmore  1998 ) .",
    "fo  aqr not only shows intermittent beat periods  suggesting that overflow is a variable phenomena  but also optical absorption features from the overflowing stream ( hellier  1990 ) that are similar to the uv features reported here in ao  psc .",
    "further , in many non - magnetic systems , eclipse profiles reveal evidence of a bright stream overflowing the disk ( e.g.  baptista  1998 ) . however , stream overflow has been most widely discussed over its role in the sw  sex phenomenon , a set of observational characteristics given a name by thorstensen ( 1991 ) .",
    "early on , shafter , hessman &  zhang ( 1988 ) proposed that overflow was occurring in one of these stars , while hellier & robinson ( 1994 ) proposed that overflow was the cause of the main sw  sex characteristics , namely `` phase 0.5 '' absorption features from the stream as it flowed over the disk , and high - velocity line wings from the re - impact of the stream with the disk .",
    "knigge  ( 2004 ) have shown that phase-0.5 absorption also occurs in the uv lines of at least one sw  sex star , while hynes  ( 2001 ) found similar sw  sex characteristics in an lmxb , suggesting that overflow can also occur in disks around neutron stars .",
    "we can thus compare ao  psc to sw  sex stars and conclude that stream overflow is likely occurring in both .",
    "indeed , it is becoming clear that overflow is widespread in many types of cataclysmic variables , which means that `` sw sex star '' becomes less a well - defined class of star and more a set of observational characteristics resulting ( 1 ) from overflow , ( 2 ) from high accretion rate ( which appears to be a feature of classic sw  sex stars ) , and ( 3 ) from being viewed at high inclination ( see , e.g. , knigge  2000 ) .    if , however , the uv absorption features seen in ao  psc have a similar origin to the `` phase 0.5 '' absorption characteristic of sw  sex stars , why do they have virtually the opposite phasing , being seen at phases 0.651.25 in ao  psc , but at pases 0.20.6 in sw  sex stars ?",
    "our explanation is as follows .",
    "the conventional sw  sex stars are high - inclination eclipsing systems in which the white dwarf is usually hidden by the optically dim wall of a flared disk .",
    "we thus see bright disk surface only beyond the white dwarf . in the model developed in hellier ( 1996 ; 1998 )",
    "the optical absorption features result when the overflowing stream obscures the optically bright disk surface , which is only during phases 0.20.6 .",
    "now , ao  psc is a lower - inclination , non - eclipsing system where any disk flare will have a lesser effect .",
    "further , the uv absorption features require a uv backlight , which can only be provided by regions near the white dwarf , and not by the cooler outer disk .",
    "these difference could explain the marked change in when absporption is visible in ao  psc , even though its origin is similar to that in sw  sex stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that , in ao  psc , sw  sex characteristics are occurring in a system which is undoubtably magnetic .",
    "this is important , first , in that it enables us to observe the interaction of the overflow with the field of the white dwarf , which results in rapid variability as the stream appears to waggle about under the influence of the spinning dipole .",
    "second , it bears on the suggestion by rodriguez - gil  ( 2001 , see also patterson  2002 ) that all sw  sex stars are magnetic , and that the magnetism is fundamentally liked to sw  sex behavior .",
    "if sw  sex characteristics are largely a consequence of stream overflow , then this can indeed occur in a magnetic system , but is unlikely to be caused by the magnetism .",
    "thus , sw  sex characteristics would be merely coincidental to ao  psc s magnetism .",
    "this would concur with the fact that many sw  sex stars are not strong x - ray sources , let alone showing the x - ray pulsations that are prominent in ao  psc , and are thus unlikely to have fields strong enough to control the accretion flow .",
    "the work presented in this paper is based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained by the space telescope science institute which is operated by aura inc under nasa contract no .",
    "5 - 26555 .",
    "we thank a referee for prompting clarifications and improvements of this work , and bill welsh for advice and assistance ."
