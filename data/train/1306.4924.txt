    "massive ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) protoplanetary discs are expected to cool rapidly enough to fragment beyond tens to a hundred au , depending on parameters of the problem @xcite .",
    "the exact fate of these clumps is however not well known because of the physical and numerical uncertainties of the calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and because of a huge parameter space ( e.g. , disc opacity , dust physics more generally , angular momentum of the incoming material , mass deposition rate into the disc , external illumination , etc . ) .    a subset of authors , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite find repeated clump formation followed by inward clump migration and tidal destruction in the inner disc .",
    "this process inspired a new `` tidal downsizing '' scenario for planet formation @xcite that can _ potentially _ explain formation of all types of planets , although much work is to be done to rigorously test and develop this model further .    two further publications , @xcite and @xcite presented simulations of marginally stable self - gravitating discs with a single planet inserted into the disc and treated as a point mass ( which disallows further gas accretion onto the planet ) , and found that the planets did migrate inward on the time scale of just a few orbits",
    ".    on the other hand , a number of other authors did not find such a strong clump migration .",
    "for example , disc simulations by @xcite show formation of many more brown dwarfs than planet - mass objects , and these do not appear to migrate inward in the discs that much .",
    "note that earlier @xmath6-prescription cooling simulations , such as @xcite , can not be useful here because these simulations typically stall due to increasingly small timesteps needed to integrate dense clump evolution when one or more clumps are formed .",
    "finally , a recent study by @xcite find that the outcome of clump formation is not a single outcome process , with 6 of their 13 clumps migrating in and crossing the inner boundary , 4 migrating and being tidally destroyed before reaching the inner boundary , and 3 becoming brown dwarfs and stalling their migration in the outer disc as they open deep gaps .",
    "@xcite suggested that it is a competition between clump migration and accretion onto the clump that appears to decide which of these outcomes takes place .",
    "in this paper we point out yet another physical complication than will have to be modelled robustly enough before the community arrives at a firm conclusion about the non - linear outcome of the gravitational disc instability .",
    "in particular , all of the gravitationally unstable disc simulations performed so far employed a prescription of some kind to approximate radiative transfer out of the disc .",
    "none of these looked into how the energy release within the gas clump ( protoplanet ) may affect the surrounding gas in the disc . to see that this `` preheating '' effect may be significant , consider the accretion luminosity of the _ whole _ protostellar disc at the unstable region , @xmath7  au : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the protostar , and @xmath10 is the accretion rate in the disc .",
    "now protoplanetary clumps of a few to 10 @xmath1 can be as bright as this or even brighter at birth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this luminosity is therefore bound to significantly heat up the gas near the clump s location .",
    "we present in  [ sec : analytical ] `` radiative zero atmosphere '' analytical arguments , familiar from the physically similar situation encountered during the growth of giant planets in the ca scenario @xcite .",
    "these arguments show that the contraction luminosity of the young protoplanet supports a hot atmosphere around the protoplanet , preventing further accretion of gas onto it .",
    "just as in ca theory , we show that there should exist a critical protoplanet mass , @xmath11 , above which the radiative atmosphere solution is unstable to self - gravity and should collapse onto the protoplanet .",
    "the implications of this argument are that previous numerical simulations that neglected radiative feedback from the protoplanets may have over - estimated the accretion rate of gas onto the clumps , thus over - produced low mass stellar companions and brown dwarfs , and under - produced lower mass objects  planets .",
    "we run numerical simulations with and without protoplanetary feedback to investigate these ideas more quantitatively .",
    "we set up a disc in a marginally gravitationally stable regime and then insert a density enhancement of a specified total mass inside of a spiral arm .",
    "we confirm the @xcite findings that the fragments stall when they accrete a significant amount of gas from the disc .",
    "specifically , without protoplanetary feedback , only protoplanets with initial mass @xmath12 migrated inward faster than they accreted gas .",
    "these planets migrated inward sufficiently fast to be tidally disrupted .",
    "however protoplanets with masses @xmath13 larger than that gained too much mass too quickly and stalled , becoming proto brown dwarfs or low mass stellar companions rather than planets .",
    "simulations which take the protoplanetary feedback into account via a prescription ( see  [ sec : rad_heat ] ) show that gas accretion is indeed significantly slowed down , so that clumps with an initial mass of as much as @xmath4 migrate rapidly and are tidally disrupted .",
    "we conclude that the non - linear outcome of clump formation in the outer self - gravitating disc strongly depends on the temperature structure near the protoplanet .",
    "future work must include the preheating effects in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "first of all , we make a note on terminology : it is not exactly clear when one should call a self - gravitating gas clump `` a planet '' .",
    "one may choose to consider hydrogen molecules dissociation and formation of a very dense `` second core '' as a sign post of planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , such a planet may accrete more mass from the disc , becoming a brown dwarf or even a low mass star , or , on the contrary , migrate very close to the parent star and be unbound by tides at separations of @xmath14  au @xcite .",
    "this may leave just a solid core behind or nothing at all , if the `` planet '' was already too hot for dust sedimentation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we can not trace all these possible outcomes , so we simply define a planet as any `` obvious '' dense self - gravitating gas condensation .",
    "therefore , a `` gas clump '' and a `` planet '' are sinonimous here .",
    "before we begin our numerical investigation , we appeal to the following parallel : accretion of the gaseous envelope on the top of a solid core immersed in a protoplanetary disc in the context of the ca model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is well known that at a given core luminosity , @xmath15 , there exists a critical core mass , @xmath11 . cores with mass less than @xmath16 are surrounded by a gaseous hydrostatic atmosphere .",
    "atmospheres of cores with mass larger than @xmath17 are too massive ( comparable in mass to @xmath16 ) for a hydrostatic solution to apply ; they `` collapse '' onto the solid core .",
    "this sets off an accretion phase onto the solid core and eventually results in formation of a giant planet .",
    "the situation we are concerned about is actually analogous to this classical result from the ca theory , except that the role of the dense core is played by the dense  mainly gaseous  protoplanet .",
    "the luminosity of the protoplanet here is not due to accretion of planetesimals but is rather due to contraction of the protoplanet .",
    "we follow the analytical argument first presented by @xcite and solve for the structure of a `` radiative zero atmosphere '' around a point mass planet of mass @xmath13 and luminosity @xmath18 . since no energy is released in the atmosphere , the luminosity is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the gas density and temperature distance @xmath22 away from the protoplanet s centre . further , writing the standard equation of hydrostatic balance for the atmosphere , we find ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the temperature , @xmath23 , and density , @xmath24 , profiles in the atmosphere : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the rosseland mean opacity and @xmath28 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "this solution is approximately valid for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the planet s radius , and as long as the envelope s mass , @xmath31 , is negligibly small compared with @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the hill s radius of the planet located a distance @xmath33 from the parent star of mass @xmath34 .",
    "the envelope s mass is given by @xmath35    we observe from equation [ menv ] that at a constant @xmath18 the envelope s mass is increasing as @xmath36 ; therefore , there will be a maximum @xmath13 at which the envelope s mass becomes comparable to @xmath13 .",
    "as in ca , the envelope in this case should contract rapidly due to its own self - gravity .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath37 marks the critical planet s mass above which a rapid accretion of additional mass from the surrounding disc sets in .",
    "protoplanets are very bright at formation , up to @xmath38 @xcite , and are extended , thus not much smaller than @xmath39 . scaling the result to this fiducial value of @xmath18 , and setting @xmath40 , we obtain @xmath41    this derivation of the critical mass is rather approximate , as many additional effects are important in real protoplanetary discs . for example , ( a ) the protoplanet s luminosity decreases with time , ( b ) it is also a function of the planet s mass itself ; ( c ) the envelope s contraction luminosity may not be neglected if its contraction becomes sufficiently fast ; ( d ) the tidal field of the star contributes at @xmath42 to loosen the envelope ; ( e ) the envelope eventually may become optically thin , so that the temperature profile at large @xmath22 would be shallower ; ( f ) the envelope s temperature and density can not fall below those of the surrounding disc at large radii .",
    "some of these effects act to increase @xmath17 , others to decrease its value .",
    "we could try to include some of these effects in our analytical model here , but unfortunately this is not worthwhile : the 1d approach can not be very accurate in the given situation as the flow of gas around the planet is distinctly a 3d pattern .",
    "therefore , we move on to 3d simulations in the next sections . in the next section",
    "we describe a procedure with which we hope to capture the essence of the radiative preheating effect in our planet - disc simulations .",
    "our numerical approach follows that described in @xcite except for a different cooling function and initial conditions .",
    "@xcite used a cooling time prescription that was a function of gas density only , smoothly joining the low and the high gas density regimes .",
    "this treatment is best for the gas within the protoplanet itself , as it follows the semi - analytic model of molecular clump cooling due to dust opacity by @xcite .",
    "the relatively low density regime , as appropriate for the ambient disc rather than the clump , was modelled with a simple assumption of a constant cooling time of 100 years .",
    "this simple approach yielded the appropriate radial range for disc fragmentation as obtained both analytically and numerically , e.g. , @xmath43 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here our focus is the material of the disc close to the planet s location .",
    "therefore we employ a more detailed although still approximate approach to radiative cooling , following a number of authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we write the energy loss rate per unit time per unit volume as @xmath44 where @xmath45 k is the background temperature set by external irradiation , @xmath46 is the optical depth estimate , given by @xmath47 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the lengthscale @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , and varies from a few au to tens of au for the range of densities found in the simulation .",
    "the opacity law is @xmath51k ) , as in the analytical model of @xcite .    as is well known , `` first cores '' hotter than @xmath52  k can not exist , since hydrogen molecules start to dissociate @xcite .",
    "this process presents a very large internal energy sink , so that the clump behaves nearly isothermally at @xmath53  k , which invariably leads to the second collapse during which the first core contract to much higher densities and becomes the `` second core '' . to mimic this behaviour , we impose a maximum temperature for our gas , @xmath54  k , and introduce a sink particle inside the clump when the density of the clump exceeds @xmath55 g  @xmath56 .",
    "the sink radius is 5  au .",
    "we do not include the dust component in the present numerical simulations , in contrast to @xcite .      in our exploratory model",
    "we make a number of simplifying assumptions and approximations .",
    "firstly , the planet s luminosity is given by @xmath57 this is based on the analytical model of @xcite at @xmath58 .",
    "we note that the contraction luminosity of a planet actually decreases with time , but in our simulations the planet s mass may be evolving ( usually increasing ) , and therefore it is not clear what to take for @xmath58 .",
    "this should not lead to significant uncertainties in the results , however , because the planet s luminosity at a constant @xmath13 decreases only by a factor of a few over the duration of our simulations .    with this in mind",
    ", we calculate the radiative gas temperature , @xmath59 , a distance @xmath22 away from the centre of the clump assuming the radiative equilibrium for the gas around the clump .",
    "we view @xmath59 as the _ minimum _ gas temperature at this location , arguing that any additional heating processes not taken into account in this analytical treatment would result in a higher temperature . for example",
    ", local contraction luminosity ( e.g. , `` @xmath60 '' work due to planet s envelope contraction ) and shocks could increase gas temperature above @xmath59 .",
    "operationally , we calculate the gas temperature , @xmath21 , at locations of sph particles , solving the energy equation that includes compressional heating and shocks minus the cooling rate given by equation [ lambda ] . if @xmath21 falls below @xmath59 we set @xmath61 .",
    "when calculating @xmath59 , we consider three different regions in order of their distance @xmath22 from the clump s centre : ( 1 ) inside the clump , @xmath62 ; ( 2 ) outside the clump but within one disc scaleheight , @xmath63 , e.g. , @xmath64 ; and finally , ( 3 ) @xmath65 .",
    "as gas density in the disc is largest in the disc midplane , decreasing in directions perpendicular to it , most of the clump `` atmosphere '' mass is located near the midplane of the disc .",
    "therefore we now search for an approximate temperature structure near the clump only along the midplane of the disc .",
    "the energy balance in the disc geometry dictates that the radiative flux out of the optically thick disc in the direction perpendicular to the midplane , @xmath66 is equal to the column - integrated heating rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath46 is the optical depth estimated as described in section ",
    "[ sec : overall ] .",
    "since we are only setting here the minimum temperature of the gas due to the radiative preheating from the protoplanet , our radiative preheating energy balance requires that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the radiative flux from the planet . in the region",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 , which yields @xmath71^{1/4}\\ ; , \\label{trad1}\\ ] ] where we replaced @xmath46 with @xmath72 to account for the optically thin limit in case @xmath73 .",
    "while equation [ trad1 ] appear to be different from the radiative zero solution ( equation [ trad ] ) for a spherical geometry , we shall see in section [ sec : atmosphere ] that the two profiles are actually quite similar in practice .    at distances",
    "@xmath74 from the planet we need to take additional consideration of the `` leakage '' of the radiative flux from the disc in the vertical direction .",
    "an approximate solution formally correct in the limit @xmath75 and a constant disc density ( as a function of @xmath22 ) yields that the radiation flux density at @xmath76 is reduced by the factor @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "thus we write for @xmath65 @xmath78^{1/4}\\ ; , \\label{trad2}\\ ] ] which then makes @xmath59 continuous at @xmath79 .",
    "finally , inside the planet itself , @xmath18 can not be considered constant : the radiative flux is exactly zero at @xmath80 as @xmath81 at the centre of the clump .",
    "therefore we set @xmath82 for @xmath83 and then use this value of @xmath18 in equation [ trad1 ] . in practice",
    "this latter prescription makes the radiative `` preheating '' within the planet completely negligible , as of course should be the case .",
    "we also set @xmath84  au for simplicity when we calculate the clump mass `` on the fly '' during simulations .",
    "numerically , we find the densest part of the protoplanet , define that location as the planet s centre , and then calculate the current mass of the protoplanet , @xmath85 , as the mass within the fixed radius @xmath30 .",
    "we found that our planets  that is dense gas clumps resulting from gravitational collapse of the initial perturbations introduced at @xmath58  are always smaller than a few to 5 au , and therefore we fixed @xmath86  au .",
    "this approach is conservative : if anything , it underestimates the importance of preheating when the planet contracts to smaller sizes .",
    "finally , we also fix @xmath87 au when we calculate @xmath59 in equation [ trad2 ] .",
    "the initial mass of the star is set to @xmath88 in all the simulations .",
    "the star is allowed to grow by accretion of gas from the protoplanetary disc if the gas crosses the accretion radius of @xmath89  au .",
    "we are interested in a marginally gravitationally _",
    "stable _ protoplanetary disc that may self - regulate its mass by the episodic creation of gas clumps that migrate inward quickly @xcite . at the same time we would like to avoid non - linear clump - clump interactions ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as much as possible , concentrating on one clump at a time .",
    "therefore , we first of all find a self - gravitating disc configuration that is on the verge of fragmenting . in particular , we set a grid of simulations with discs initially extending from 20 to 200 au , with the radial profile @xmath90 , and the initial disc masses , @xmath91 , in the range from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "the disc material is initially set on circular orbits around the protostar .",
    "we then follow the disc evolution for @xmath94 orbits at the outer disc edge .",
    "we found that the disc with the initial mass of @xmath95 does not fragment , although shows 2 strong spiral arms .",
    "we note that the spiral density waves in this rather high mass disc transfer angular momentum quickly , as expected @xcite , so that the disc becomes less unstable as time progresses .",
    "therefore we are confident that the disc in this simulation would not fragment even if we continued the simulation for an infinitely long time . on the other hand , the disc with an initial mass of @xmath96 fragmented on a number of clumps , with a complicated behaviour reminiscent of that found in @xcite .",
    "we thus select the disc with @xmath97 at time @xmath98 years as our starting initial condition . a density perturbation",
    "is then inserted in the disc in a very simple way , e.g. , by increasing the gas density in a selected region by a factor of 4 . in practice",
    "this is done by adding new sph particles in the region .",
    "these new particles copy the density , temperature and velocity fields of the existing sph particles in the region ; the coordinates of the new sph particles are shifted by a small distance , @xmath99 , from their `` parent '' particles in random directions . here",
    "@xmath100 is the sph smoothing length of the parent particle .",
    "our results are essentially independent of the exact procedure in which the perturbation is inserted since we allow the region to contract and relax somewhat before radiative preheating is turned on ( see below ) .",
    "the location of the perturbation is set to be at the radial distance of 75 au from the parent star ( which is close to the radial location of the minimum in the toomre s q - parameter ) at the densest part of the spiral arms .",
    "the surface density of the initial disc with perturbation of mass @xmath101 is shown in figure [ fig : disc0 ] .    with this identical approach and numerical scheme",
    "we run a set of simulations with and without planet feedback on its surroundings and the initial perturbation mass varying between @xmath102 and @xmath103 is increments of factor of two .",
    "the corresponding runs are labelled mx or mxf , where x is the mass of the initial perturbation in jupiter masses .    in the runs with feedback",
    ", the feedback is `` turned on '' after half a rotation .",
    "this measure is taken to allow the initial perturbation to actually contract gravitationally into a well defined self - bound clump before any feedback is produced .",
    "figure [ fig : rvsm ] presents the planet - star separation , @xmath33 , of the simulated planets versus their mass .",
    "the initial masses of the planets are @xmath102 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and @xmath103 for the red , blue , green , violet , cyan and black curves , respectively . as explained at the end of section [ sec : rad_heat ] , to avoid ambiguities as to what is a planet , we measure the planet s mass as that within a fixed radius of @xmath104  au for this figure .",
    "we find that at later times all the planets contract sufficiently to be within @xmath105  au .",
    "for the lowest mass perturbations , this procedure slightly over - estimates the initial planetary mass somewhat , whereas for the highest mass perturbation the planetary mass is underestimated ( which is why the initial masses of planets in the figure may appear slightly different from the values quoted above ) .",
    "however , this convention affects only the first @xmath106 half a rotation of the planets around their parent stars in the simulations and has a very minor effect on the final results .",
    "the end of the simulation here is defined either when the protoplanet is completely destroyed by tidal torques , or gains a sufficient amount of mass to become the `` second core '' @xcite , which in these simulations is always of a brown dwarf mass .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rvsm ] , results for runs with feedback are shown by solid curves , whereas those without feedback are dotted .",
    "same colours are used for runs with the same initial perturbation mass .",
    "a planet growing in mass at a constant separation would trace a horizontal track , while a planet migrating radially at a constant mass would be on a vertical line .",
    "initially , dotted and dashed curves coincide , so that planets migrate inward and gain mass from their surroundings .",
    "this is simply because the radiative feedback is switched on with a delay of half the initial period to allow the clump to contract sufficiently .",
    "there is then a bifurcation in trajectories of the planets once the feedback switches on .",
    "planets with feedback ( solid curves ) accrete gas at smaller rates than their counterparts without feedback , as expected .",
    "relatively low mass protoplanets , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 migrate inward more rapidly than they contract independently of whether the feedback is on or off . however , for higher mass protoplanets , starting with @xmath109 ( runs m4 and m4f ) , where the protoplanets end up in the figure depend drastically on the feedback .",
    "the @xmath110 planet without feedback accretes mass very rapidly and becomes a brown - dwarf mass object with mass of @xmath111 , having migrated to @xmath112  au . in contrast , the @xmath110 planet with feedback grows in mass much slower , reaching the maximum mass of only @xmath4 . at this point",
    "the planet is already at @xmath113 au , where tidal torques from the star start to unbind it .",
    "eventually the planet migrates to @xmath114  au and gets totally unbound .",
    "similarly , the @xmath115 with feedback grows to @xmath116 ; but , having migrated too closely in , gets unbound at @xmath117  au .",
    "the same case without feedback becomes as massive as @xmath118 , at which point it collapses into the second configuration .",
    "this proto-planet  migrates very little , ending up close to where it started at the end of the simulation , and actually evolving to @xmath119 ( see  [ sec : m8 ] .",
    "finally , the heaviest perturbation runs considered here , @xmath120 , end up as sink particles , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , for the feedback and no feedback runs , respectively . in both of these cases the sink continues to grow in mass .",
    "however , even in this case ( m16f ) , the feedback has apparently played a role in the evolution of the protoplanet .",
    "the final separation of the sink particle from the parent star is smaller in run m16f than it is in m16 .",
    "to summarise , all of the runs presented here , with or without feedback , yielded one of the two possible outcomes : ( a ) an inward migration of lower mass clumps , followed by their tidal disruption at the inner disc , or ( b ) rapid accretion of gas onto the more massive protoplanets from the disc , followed by collapse to the second core ( proto brown dwarf ) .",
    "we shall see later on that the sink particles introduced continue to grow rapidly .",
    "the end result of ( b ) is thus formation of a low mass secondary star in orbit around the primary .",
    "the role of radiative preheating from the protoplanet is to only shift the dividing mass of the planet at which the transition from evolutionary path ( a ) to that of ( b ) takes place .",
    "in this section we contrast the @xmath123 simulation without feedback ( m8 ) with the same @xmath2 run but with feedback ( m8f ) .",
    "these particular simulations exemplify the effects of the radiative feedback from protoplanets on its surroundings in the most clear way .",
    "the top panel in figure [ fig : vst ] shows the time evolution of the protoplanetary mass , whereas the bottom panel of the figure shows the planet - star separation versus time .",
    "the solid and dotted curves correspond to simulations with feedback and without , respectively .",
    "the dotted curve has a discontinuity in it to emphasise the `` phase transition '' that occurs in the evolution of simulation m8 . before time",
    "@xmath124  yrs , the clump is molecular , e.g. , it is the first core in the usual terminology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas after that time molecular hydrogen in the clump dissociates , so that the clump collapses to much higher densities and becomes the second core .",
    "the latter phase of the evolution is shown with the red color .",
    "we can not continue to resolve such high densities due to numerical limitations .",
    "a sink particle with sink radius of 5  au is introduced at that point .",
    "the sink continues to accrete gas from the disc . note that its accretion rate is not steady .",
    "there is a particularly rapid accretion episode at @xmath125  yrs , when the secondary sink disrupts and then accretes a gas clump that migrated from the outer disc .",
    "the latter clump was not introduced in the disc artificially ; instead it formed during the simulation due to the perturbations of the `` original '' protoplanet we inserted .",
    "more on this below in this section .",
    "in contrast , in simulation m8f , the mass of the protoplanet varies by about a factor of two while it spirals in on the timescale of about @xmath126 years .",
    "the simulation ends with the planet destroyed by tidal forces at @xmath127  au .",
    "figure [ fig : disc_vs_clump ] presents the same simulations but focuses on the interaction between the planet and the disc . in figure",

    "the top most panel in the figure show the gas column density at time @xmath128 2000  yrs for the simulations . in both cases the gas clumps at the top right corner , and further gas concentrations on the way to contracting into clumps at @xmath129 au ,",
    "are not the ones we are interested in . as explained in section [ sec : init ] , we avoided as much as possible formation of these additional clumps by using the initial condition with a marginally stable disc .",
    "we emphasise that no clumps develop in the control simulation that we used to initialise the disc ( cf .",
    "[ sec : init ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is clear that these `` uninteresting '' clumps were spawned by gravitational disc instability _ amplified _ by the introduction of the clump that we do study here .",
    "we do not introduce feedback inside and around the second generation clumps as we are not interested in those .",
    "the first generation clumps are located in the inner disc in both cases . in the case without feedback ,",
    "the clump stalls close to its initial location , at @xmath130 au . in the simulation with feedback , on the other hand , the clump is at @xmath131 au at that time ( these results are in accord with figure [ fig : vst ] , of course ) .",
    "the middle and the bottom row of panels in figure [ fig : disc_vs_clump ] show the total gas mass in radial annuli ( for information , the bin size is proportional to radius @xmath132 ) in the simulation m8 and m8f ( left and right , respectively ) .",
    "the protoplanet is identifiable as a strong maximum inside 100 au ; additional maxima outside this region are the secondary clumps that we do not study here .",
    "the effects of the protoplanet in run m8f on its surrounding disc are barely discernable , whereas in the no - feedback case m8 the protoplanet strongly alters the disc structure .",
    "namely , in the latter case the protoplanet almost succeeds in carving out a gap around its radial position .",
    "the deficit of gas near the planet s location in simulation m8 is visible in the top ( left ) panel of the figure , and is further quantified in the middle and the bottom left panels .",
    "there is a deep depression in the disc mass on both sides of the planet .",
    "it is clear that this protoplanet settles into the type ii migration regime , and this must be the main reason why the planet s migration rate is much slower than that for the other simulation .    in the simulation with feedback ,",
    "on the other hand , the protoplanet s mass stays low enough to not open the gap in the disc .",
    "indeed , the panels in the right column of figure [ fig : disc_vs_clump ] show that there is not even a depression in the radial profile of the disc mass . as argued by @xcite , when no gap is opened , protoplanets are expected to migrate inward very rapidly , i.e. , nearly dynamically . in our simulation",
    "this situation persists until the planet arrives near the inner edge of the disc .",
    "note that the planet s orbit is then not exactly circular and the eccentricity increases with time ( cf .",
    "the bottom panel in figure [ fig : vst ] ) .",
    "the main driver of these differences in the planet - disc interaction is the mass of the protoplanet , whose evolution is strongly influenced by the radiative feedback ( preheating ) from the clump , as we now show .",
    "we now consider the behaviour of the material near the protoplanet in simulations m8 and m8f . as explained previously , these two cases differ significantly at late times , when both the radial position and the mass of the protoplanets diverge ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig : vst ] ) . for a meaningful quantitative comparison",
    "we therefore contrast the clumps soon after the feedback is turned on , just as their evolution starts to take different paths , at time @xmath133  years ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : vst ] ) .",
    "both the mass and the radial position of the clumps are approximately the same at that time .",
    "figure [ fig : clump_structure ] shows temperature , density and radial velocity of gas particles as a function of distance , @xmath22 , from the protoplanet s centre ( defined as its densest point ) .",
    "red and black dots and curves correspond to simulation m8f and m8 , respectively . in the top panels",
    "dots show temperature ( left ) and density ( right panel ) at the location of individual sph particles .",
    "the left top panel shows that the density in the atmosphere of the protoplanet without feedback is @xmath134 times higher than in simulation m8f .",
    "the curves in the right panel of figure [ fig : clump_structure ] show the radiative zero solution temperature , @xmath59 , defined by equation [ trad ] . here",
    "@xmath135 is the minimum of the enclosed mass within radius @xmath22 and @xmath4 .",
    "these curves play no role in the actual simulation , but are presented here to make a comparison with the radiative zero solution .",
    "there is a significant dispersion in sph particles temperature at the same distance from the planet s centre , which is to be expected given that the geometry ceases to be quasi - spherical and becomes disc - like farther away from the planet .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the gas around the planet at @xmath136  au is significantly colder than @xmath59 for the simulation without feedback ( m8 ) . at the same time",
    ", gas may be significantly hotter at the same location for simulation m8f , with the mean value of @xmath21 following @xmath59 approximately .",
    "the importance of this difference in the temperature profile near the planet is best appreciated in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : clump_structure ] , where we show the mean radial velocity ( defined with respect to the planet s centre , of course ) of sph particles for the two simulations .",
    "the simulation without feedback ( black curve ) has a significant negative radial velocity , indicating infall , e.g. , accretion .",
    "the maximum infall velocity is nearly 0.4 km  s@xmath137 at @xmath94  au , which is slightly above the isothermal sound speed for molecular gas at temperature of 30 k , @xmath138 km  s@xmath137 ( cf .",
    "the black dots at this distance in the top right panel ) .",
    "this shows that gas is contracting quite rapidly onto the protoplanet in simulation m8 , fuelling its rapid growth in mass .",
    "in contrast , in simulation with radiative preheating ( m8f , red curve ) , the maximum infall velocity , reached at @xmath139  au , is a fraction of the gas sound speed , and becomes several times smaller than that closer in .",
    "gas accretion is thus strongly hindered due to larger pressure gradient around the clump , which in itself is due to radiative preheating of the material near planet .",
    "this protoplanet is thus surrounded by a quasi - static atmosphere , as expected based on our approximate analytical theory .",
    "these differences only get amplified at later times , as figure [ fig : clump_structure2 ] shows , where we show exactly same quantities but at time @xmath140  yrs .",
    "the m8f clump actually starts to loose mass rather than gain it ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vst ] ) , as is seen from a positive radial velocity in the bottom panel .",
    "this is in stark contrast to simulation m8 ( no feedback ) , where the inward gas velocity reaches almost 1 km  sec@xmath137 .",
    "in this paper we studied the evolution of a self - gravitating gas clump in a marginally gravitationally stable disc .",
    "we found that below a certain critical clump mass , @xmath16 , gas clumps migrate inward and get tidally disrupted quickly . above this mass the clumps accrete gas from the disc rapidly , eventually becoming as massive as several tens of jupiter masses . at such a high mass the gas clumps collapse into the second core configuration due to hydrogen molecules dissociation @xcite .",
    "these clumps become too massive for the disc to be transported inward rapidly .",
    "therefore they stall and continue to grow by accretion , becoming massive brown dwarfs or low mass companions to the host star .",
    "we also studied how this behaviour changes if the radiative output of the protoplanet due to its contraction luminosity is taken into account .",
    "we found that the qualitative behaviour of the simulations did not change , except the value of @xmath16 increases .",
    "in particular , in the simulations without radiative preheating from the planet , we obtained @xmath16 between 2 and 4 @xmath1 , whereas with preheating @xmath141 rises to between @xmath4 and @xmath142 .",
    "this result is consistent with the approximate analytical argument , presented in ",
    "[ sec : analytical ] , similar in spirit to the well known core accretion result @xcite .",
    "this argument shows that radiative preheating from the clump may be sufficiently important to arrest gas accretion for clumps smaller than @xmath143 ( see equation [ mcrit ] ) .",
    "having said this , we note that for clumps less massive than @xmath144 , inward migration appears so rapid that the outcome is similar whether the pre - heating is included or not : the clump is tidally disrupted at a few tens of au .",
    "the qualitative behaviour found in this paper  migration and tidal disruption of low mass clumps , but migration stalling and rapid gas accretion commencing for high mass clumps  is likely to be general for marginally stable discs .",
    "we are however certain that the critical mass @xmath16 itself is likely to depend on the disc opacity , mass , radial location of where the gas clump is born , and the surrounding temperature of the disc .",
    "for example , higher disc temperatures may render radiative preheating from the clump ineffective in supporting the radiative atmosphere .",
    "a fuller investigation of the parameter space is planned in the near future .    despite the fact that our study only covers a small fraction of the available parameter space , we believe that the sensitivity of the final fate of the clump to its initial mass ( and other parameters in the problem , as discussed above ) , and such detail as radiative preheating of gas near the clump , is an important result to note .",
    "we believe this sensitivity may be the reason why different groups of numerical simulators obtain widely differing results , with some finding that massive self - gravitating discs around young stars mainly fragment onto brown dwarfs and low mass stars @xcite , whereas others find that young gaseous clumps mainly migrate and get tidally disrupted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , see also @xcite . in our opinion",
    ", it is possible that relatively small differences in the numerical techniques and/or regions of the parameter space studied may be sufficient to lead to divergent results obtained in those previous studies .",
