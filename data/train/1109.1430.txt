    "the increase of @xmath90 with @xmath24 and the field independent @xmath52 imply that @xmath91 decreases with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with the high - field nmr result.@xcite the small high - field value of @xmath51 reported in ref .",
    ", in combination with the saturating @xmath82 and the field dependence of @xmath92 observed here , suggests that @xmath5 continues to increase at higher fields .",
    "note that the anisotropy of @xmath93 ( ref .  ) observed in very high fields by upper critical field measurements can not be directly compared with the magnetic penetration depth anisotropy @xmath5 investigated here , because in general @xmath94.@xcite + a field dependent @xmath5 might be associated with a complex band structure , since in the case of multiple superconducting gaps originating from different bands the superconducting screening currents , related to @xmath51 and @xmath95 , may give rise to an unusual behavior of @xmath5 .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in mgb@xmath2 , where the two - gap excitation spectrum yields a strongly field dependent anisotropy.@xcite in mgb@xmath2 , as the field increases , the gap from the 3d @xmath96-band is closed , so the main part of the superconducting fluid density comes from the 2d @xmath97-band .",
    "the 2d character of the remaining band implies a larger anisotropy .",
    "+ band structure calculations@xcite in @xmath14fe@xmath1se@xmath2  yield multiple bands , with four 2d sheets on the sides of the brillouin zone and one cylindrical sheet at the center .",
    "depending on doping , this cylinder can be split into two 3d cones in k@xmath20fe@xmath2se@xmath2,@xcite which are completely detached ( 3d ) in the calculation of ref .  ,",
    "although when the authors use experimental lattice parameters these cones are replaced by a cylinder ( 2d ) . according to ref .  , the center band is a cylinder . in csfe@xmath2se@xmath2 and cs@xmath20fe@xmath2se@xmath2",
    ", this band consists in two almost detached cones.@xcite in tl@xmath98rb@xmath99fe@xmath100se@xmath2,@xcite two gaps of different amplitudes were observed on the side and center bands , but the candidate for a 3d inner band was to small for a gap to be observed .",
    "it is therefore not yet clear whether for rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  with the doping used in this work a 3d band is present .",
    "clearly , more material specific work is needed in order to clarify the interplay between multiband superconductivity and the anisotropy of rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 . however , if a 2d-3d band scenario is the origin of the field dependence of the anisotropy of rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 , it must be temperature dependent as well,@xcite which is not the case according to fig .",
    "[ gamma_t]d .",
    "+ the temperature independent @xmath5 suggests that the origin of its field dependence is not related to the superconducting gap energy , which is strongly temperature dependent in the examined temperature range .",
    "however , there is one energy scale which is almost temperature independent in the superconducting state : the nel temperature @xmath19  k.@xcite a superconductor coexisting with an antiferromagnetic phase is expected to behave in a peculiar way , although the temperature range studied here is far too low to excite any change in this strongly coupled antiferromagnet .",
    "however , magnetic field modifications can lead to changes in the domain structure , and therefore changes of coupling between superconducting areas .",
    "this could result in variations of the `` averaged '' effective anisotropy . as was shown for various iron - based superconductors , the lattice parameters , in particular the pnictogen height in the iron - pnictides ,",
    "are directly related to superconductivity.@xcite importantly , such scaling also works for the iron - selenide layer.@xcite it is also possible that magnetostrictive effects , which are expected to increase with magnetic field , may influence the lattice parameters and by that the anisotropy of the system .",
    "in such a case the strong curvature of @xmath68(@xmath54 ) in the vicinity of @xmath16 often observed in pnictides / chalcogenides may be explained by the change of @xmath16 with @xmath24 caused by the change of pnictogen height .",
    "in summary , we present an investigation of the magnetic properties of rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 revealing a strong field dependence of @xmath5 ranging from @xmath101 to @xmath102 . this behavior stands out among other iron - based superconductors , consistent with the singular coexistence of magnetic ordering and superconductivity . in accordance with lower critical field measurements ,",
    "our data suggest that in very low fields @xmath89 . at 1.4  t",
    "the effective magnetic penetration depth is @xmath103 m .",
    "the vortex phase in rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  is best described by an isotropic three dimensional state in low fields which becomes strongly anisotropic with increasing field . in this respect",
    "the novel iron - selenide rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  could be a potential candidate for magnetic - field tuned applications of superconductivity .",
