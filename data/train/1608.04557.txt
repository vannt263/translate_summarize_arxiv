    "there have been long - time efforts for about 150 years to resolve the paradox of maxwell s demon  @xcite .",

    "szilard opened the era of information thermodynamics by considering a tractable prototype , later called the szilard engine , of maxwell s demon  @xcite which has been studied extensively up to date .",
    "the paradox was claimed that the sole effect after the completion of the szilard engine for one cycle is entropy loss in heat reservoir , ( work extraction in the absence of a cooler reservoir ) , which seemingly violates the thermodynamic second law . through many efforts resolving the paradox , common",
    "perspective is that the demon should be treated as a physical memory device to measure the state of a target system and information gain / use can be defined as having the same footing as entropy , which were supported by information theory developed independently in computer science  @xcite .    the whole information process controlled by maxwell",
    "s demon can be divided into the measurement process with information gain and the post - measurement process with information use . for a bit - information process within a memory device , as proposed by landauer  @xcite",
    ", one can imagine a particle moving in a double - well potential inside a memory chip .",
    "empty memory state before measurement corresponds to localization in one well .",
    "memory state is changed by time - varying potential that is initially perturbed by a target state of system and is set to return to the original double - well . during this process , memory state goes to a local equilibrium in either well which is read as a measurement outcome .",
    "as in real situations , measurement time is so short that system state remains unchanged during measurement . in post - measurement , the obtained measurement outcome turns into a protocol via feedback which influences the subsequent dynamics of the system .",
    "the first candidate of information content in measurement - feedback process was the change in shannon entropy  @xcite of memory device .",
    "however , it can not deal with post - measurement process because memory state remains frozen in a local equilibrium or may be erased for the purpose of another measurement without changing the system dynamics . by using the landauer principle ,",
    "it was often claimed that heat loss in reservoir can be compensated by sufficient heat dissipation produced in the course of the erasure of memory  @xcite .",
    "however , erasure is not necessarily simultaneous with post - measurement .",
    "indeed , the two processes are independent .",
    "a satisfactory thermodynamic theory integrating measurement and post - measurement has recently been developed since late 2000s  @xcite .",
    "the so - called information thermodynamics exploits the information science  @xcite and the modern nonequilibrium principle of the fluctuation theorem  @xcite .",
    "the central notion is that system and memory be regarded as a composite one with correlation leading to an entropic contribution , called mutual information .",
    "the role of mutual information has been confirmed in feedback experiments  @xcite . beyond resolving the paradox of maxwell s demon ,",
    "there have been many studies on feedback processes in diverse perspectives such as repeated feedback  @xcite , optimal protocol change for maximum extraction of work in feedback processes  @xcite , cold damping  @xcite , time - delayed feedback  @xcite , information flow  @xcite , and information engine  @xcite .    in this study",

    "<S> we investigate thermodynamics of feedback processes driven by measurement . </S>",
    "<S> regarding system and memory device as a composite system , mutual information as a measure of correlation between the two constituents contributes to the entropy of the composite system , which makes the generalized total entropy of the joint system and reservoir satisfy the second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the thermodynamics of the szilard engine for an intermediate period before the completion of cycle . </S>",
    "<S> we show the second law to hold resolving the paradox of maxwell s demon independent of the period taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate a feedback process to confine a particle excessively within a trap , which is operated by repetitions of feedback in a finite time interval . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the stability condition for multi - step feedback and find the condition for confinement below thermal fluctuation in the absence of feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the results are found to depend on interval between feedback steps and intensity of feedback protocol , which are expected to be important parameters in real experiments . </S>"
