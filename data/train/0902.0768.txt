    "starting from the exact keldysh - kadanoff / baym equations for the correlation functions we neglected certain matrix elements in the basis representation and obtained a scheme which is expected to be efficient for application to atoms .",
    "the idea is to restrict the computationally costly evaluation of the correlation self - energy to a subset of the single - particle basis .",
    "thereby only the lowest lying bound states are treated fully correlated , while the continuum is approximated by hartree - fock and ideal basis functions .",
    "we have performed the first tests on the 1d - beryllium model atom which provide a framework for further investigations .",
    "further optimization of the basis subdivision towards improved convergence and application to nonequilibrium photoionizaiton dynamics will be presented in a forthcoming work .",
