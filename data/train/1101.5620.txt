    "wasp-17b is a transiting , 0.49-jupiter - mass planet in a 3.74-day orbit around a metal - poor , 1.3-solar - mass f6v star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a10 ) .",
    "data presented in a10 , confirmed by and @xcite , indicated that wasp-17b is in a retrograde orbit around its host star , the first such orbit to be found .",
    "wasp-17b probably formed beyond the ice line in a near - circular , coplanar orbit , as predicted by the canonical model of star and planet formation .",
    "it may have subsequently acquired an eccentric , highly inclined orbit via planet - planet scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the kozai mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "tidal friction may then have shortened and circularised the long , eccentric orbit , with the energy being dissipated within the planet as heat ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the planet is low - mass and the star is hot (  = @xmath4k , t10 ) and fast - rotating (  = 9.8 , t10 ) , the radial velocity ( rv ) measurements are relatively low signal - to - noise , and so the eccentricity of the planet s orbit was poorly constrained ( e = 00.24 ) in the discovery paper ( a10 ) .",
    "this translated into uncertainties in the stellar radius (= 1.21.6 ) and thus in the planetary radius (  = 1.52.0 ) , meaning the planet is larger than predicted by the standard cooling theory of irradiated gas giant planets by 0.20.7  @xcite .    using a coupled radius - orbit evolutionary model , @xcite demonstrated that planets can be inflated to radii of 2  and beyond during a transient phase of heating that accompanies the tidal circularisation of a short ( @xmath5 au ) , highly eccentric ( @xmath6 ) orbit .",
    "such a large radius persists for only a few tens of myr , suggesting that we are unlikely to observe any one system during this brief stage .",
    "however , only 34 of the @xmath7100 known planets are extremely bloated and the transit technique does preferentially find large planets",
    ".    argued that the tidal heating rate is underestimated for even moderately eccentric orbits in studies such as that of @xcite .",
    "if true , then a large fraction of energy tidally dissipated within the planet would have been radiated away by the age typical of the most bloated planets ( a few gyr ) and so could not have played a significant role in their observed bloating .",
    "@xcite admit that their equations are not applicable at large eccentricity , but counter that neither are those that use .",
    "they state that the current uncertainty in tidal theory means that no approach can be considered correct .    in a10 ,",
    "the derived radius of wasp-17b is largest ( 2.0 ) when a circular orbit is imposed , smaller ( 1.7 ) when eccentricity is a free parameter ( @xmath8 ) , and smaller again ( 1.5 ) when a main - sequence prior is imposed on the star and eccentricity is let free ( @xmath9 ) . @xcite and @xcite each note that , compared to planets that did not undergo tidal heating , tidally inflated planets are still signicantly larger gyr after their orbits have circularised and tidal heating has ceased . in each study",
    "though , the orbits are still significantly non - circular ( @xmath10 ) when the planets are largest .",
    "hence , if the orbit of wasp-17b were found to be near - circular ( which would mean that  @xmath11 2 ) then it would seem unlikely that the planet could have been inflated by a single episode of tidal inflation .",
    "another possibility is an ongoing tidal heating scenario , as explored by @xcite , in which the orbit of wasp-17b would be kept non - circular by the continuing interaction with an as - yet undiscovered third body .    in order to better constrain the stellar and planetary radii , the system age , and the potential transient and ongoing tidal heating rates ,",
    "an improved determination of orbital eccentricity is required .",
    "further high - precision rv measurements were obtained and presented in t10 . these allowed eccentricity",
    "to be better constrained to @xmath12 .",
    "the best prospect of improving this situation further lay with the measurement of an occultation ( as the planet passes behind the star ) , which would constrain , where @xmath13 is the argument of periastron .",
    "in addition , by observing occultations from the ground and from space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are able to perform photometry and emission spectroscopy of exoplanets which are spatially unresolved from their host stars .",
    "this allows us to determine planet albedos and the rates at which energy is redistributed from the day side to the night side of the planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to infer the temperature structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and chemical composition of planet atmospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we present here observations of two occultations of wasp-17b , each of which was measured at both 4.5 and 8 .",
    "we combine these new data with existing data in a simultaneous analysis to show that wasp-17b is the largest (  = 2.0 ) and least - dense (  = 0.06 ) planet known , and is in a slightly eccentric orbit around a 23 gyr - old , f - type star .",
    "exoplanet occultation photometry is at the limit of _ spitzer _ systematics and reliable conclusions concerning atmospheres and orbits depend on a careful analysis of the data .",
    "we thus present a detailed description of our method .",
    "we observed two occultations of the planet wasp-17b by its @xmath14 host star with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite during 2009 april 24 and 2009 may 1 . on each date we measured the wasp-17 system with the infrared array camera ( irac , * ?",
    "* ) in full array mode ( @xmath15pixels , 1.2  arcsec / pixel ) simultaneously in channel 2 ( 4.5 ) and channel 4 ( 8 ) for a duration of 8.4  hr . we used an effective integration time of 10.4  s , resulting in 2319  images per channel per occultation . to reduce the time - dependent sensitivity of the 8  channel ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we exposed the array to a bright , diffuse source ( m42 ) for 214 frames immediately prior to each occultation observation .",
    "we used the images calibrated by the standard _",
    "pipeline ( version s18.7.0 ) and delivered to the community as basic calibrated data ( bcd ) .",
    "we added back to each image the estimated brightness of the zodiacal light in the sky dark @xcite so photometric uncertainties and the optimal aperture radii are correctly determined . for each image , we converted flux from mjy  sr@xmath16 to electrons and then used iraf to perform aperture photometry for wasp-17 , using circular apertures with a range of radii ( 16  pixels ) .",
    "the apertures were centred by fitting a gaussian profile on the target .",
    "the sky background was measured in an annulus extending from 8 to 12 pixels from the aperture centre , and was subtracted from the flux measured within the on - source apertures .",
    "we estimated the photometric uncertainty as the quadrature addition of the uncertainty in the sky background in the on - source aperture , the read - out noise , and the poisson noise of the total background - subtracted counts within the on - source aperture .",
    "we calculated the mid - exposure times in the hjd ( utc ) time system from the mhjd_obs header values , which are the start times of the dces ( data collection events ) , by adding half the integration time ( framtime ) values .",
    "we found ( see section 3 ) that for wasp-17 the highest signal - to - noise is obtained when using an aperture radius of 2.9 pixels for the 4.5  data , and a radius of 1.6 pixels for the 8  data .",
    "the data are displayed raw and binned in the first and second panels , respectively , of figure  [ fig : spitz ] .",
    "we rejected any flux measurement that was discrepant with the median of its 20 neighbours ( a window width of 4.4 min ) by more than four times its theoretical error bar .",
    "we also performed a rejection on target position . for each image and for the _",
    "x _ and _ y _ detector coordinates separately , we computed the difference between the fitted target position and the median of its 20 neighbours . for each dataset",
    ", we then calculated the standard deviation @xmath1 of these _ median differences _ and rejected any points discrepant by more than 4 @xmath1 .",
    "the numbers of points rejected on flux and target position for each dataset are given in table  [ tab : rej ] .",
    "according to the irac handbook , each irac array receives approximately 1.5 solar - proton and cosmic - ray hits per second , with @xmath72 pixels affected in channel 2 , and @xmath76 pixels per hit affected in channel 4 , while the cosmic ray flux varies randomly by up to a factor of a few over time - scales of minutes .",
    "thus the probability per exposure that pixels within the stellar aperture will be affected by a cosmic ray hit is 1.5 per cent for channel 2 and 1.3 per cent for channel 4 , which is in good agreement with the small portion of frames that we rejected .",

    "[ fig : detpos ] we present the detector positions of wasp-17 both during and outside of occultation . on 2009",
    "apr 24 , the star occupied the same region of the detector during the occultation as when outside of occultation .",
    "however , on 2009 may 1 , the star occupied different regions of the detector during occultation than when outside of occultation , though there was some overlap .",
    "the reason for this can be seen in the top - right panel of figure  [ fig : eclpos ] , which shows that the star moved steadily in the @xmath21-direction .",
    "this was in addition to the motion due to the nodding of the spacecraft , which resulted in some overlap between the in - occultation and out - of - occultation detector positions .",
    "as we decorrelate the light curves with detector position , the data from 2009 apr 24 , with the greater detector position overlap , are thought to be more reliable .",
    "however , the data from the two occultations detrend similarly well , and we find no reason to disregard the latter dataset .    , @xmath22 ) = ( 24,25 ) , and the 8  relative to ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) = ( 25,23 ) .",
    "note that , though the axes ranges are the same between the two plots , each abscissa covers only 60 per cent the range of each ordinate .",
    "[ fig : detpos],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this indicates that , though we had requested the same detector positions for the target for each observation run , small differences in the pointing and motion of _ spitzer _ can result in markedly different systematics .",
    "we investigated using the fitted psf positions from the higher signal - to - noise 4.5  data in the aperture photometry and positional decorrelation of the 8  data . to account for the offset between the two detectors we fit the differences in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions and translated the coordinates by those amounts .",
    "the 8  occultation depths , both when incorporating one of the two datasets or both of them , were very similar to those obtained when fitting the stellar psf position in the 8  data , and there was no significant reduction in the residual scatter about the best - fitting models .",
    "hence , we proceeded as before .    _",
    "s pointing oscillates around the nominal position , with an amplitude of @xmath70.1 pixels over a period of @xmath71 hour .",
    "we also see higher frequency jitter , with periods of 12 minutes ( the cadence of our data is 12 seconds ) , in the position of wasp-17 . some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) chose to smooth the measured target positions prior to light curve detrending .",
    "however , we found that detrending with the unsmoothed positions resulted in a reduced bic ( @xmath23bic = @xmath24 ) , and in smaller residual rms values : 5.3 and 8.8 per cent lower for the two 4.5  datasets , and 0.6 and 1.4 per cent lower for the two 8  datasets .    to ascertain whether the observed short - period jitter was due to measurement error , we measured the position of a second star in the field for the two 4.5  datasets .",
    "for both wasp-17 and the second star we subtracted their gaussian - smoothed ( @xmath25 s ) positions to remove the longer - period oscillations .",
    "we then fitted gaussians to the distributions of the detector @xmath21 and @xmath22 coordinates of both stars and of their relative separations .",
    "if the measured positions of wasp-17 and the second star are uncorrelated , then the variance of the distribution of relative separations would be the sum of the variances of the distributions of each star s positions .",
    "however , we found that the distribution of separation in the @xmath21-direction had a variance smaller than that by a factor nine for the first dataset and by a factor two for the second dataset .",
    "for the @xmath22-coordinate , the factors were 25 and 6 for the two datasets .",
    "thus , the short - period jitter is real and the light curves should be detrended with unsmoothed target positions .      as a check of the choice of aperture radius ( 2.9 pixels ) for the 4.5   data , we input the 4.5  light curves obtained with each aperture radius into a simultaneous mcmc analysis that incorporated all but the 8  data .",
    "these analyses produced consistent 4.5  occultation depths ( figure [ fig : rms - depth ] , upper panel ) , indicating that the 4.5  result is relatively insensitive to the choice of aperture radius .",
    "as a check of the choice of aperture radius ( 1.6 pixels ) for the 8   data , we input each 8  light curve into a simultaneous mcmc analysis that incorporated all other data . when decorrelating with detector position ( figure [ fig : rms - depth ] , middle panel ) , the fitted 8  occultation depth varies weakly with aperture radius . beyond an aperture radius of 3.5 pixels ( by which point the flux due to",
    "the sky background is 3 times that of the target within the target aperture ) , a deeper occultation is measured . without decorrelating with detector position ( figure [ fig : rms - depth ] , lower panel ) ,",
    "the fitted 8  occultation depth is a strong function of aperture radius .    as the conclusions drawn from _ spitzer _",
    "occultation observations depend on accurately measured occultation depths , we advise others to check for a correlation between flux and detector position in their 5.8  and 8  datasets , and for a dependence of occultation depth on aperture radius . for example , from figure  1 of @xcite it appears that similar patterns of saw - tooth systematics are present in both the 4.5 and 8  light curve , though they only decorrelate the former light curve with detector position . if a dependence of measured flux on detector position was introduced during aperture photometry then the measured 8  occultation depth could be erroneous .    ]      to verify the 8  occultation depths and to investigate the source of the dependence of the measured 8  flux on detector position , we obtained 8  light curves by performing deconvolution photometry with decphot .",
    "this method was first described by @xcite and has been optimized for _ spitzer _ data by lanotte et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "it is based on the image - deconvolution method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , which respects the sampling theorem of @xcite , in contrast with traditional deconvolution methods . in a first step ,",
    "25 random bcd images taken on 2009 april 24 were used to determine a partial psf .",
    "this was then used to deconvolve the whole set of images and to determine optimally the position and flux of wasp-17 .",
    "the decphot light curves do not exhibit a position - dependent modulation of the flux ( figure  [ fig : spitz - ch4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the saw - tooth modulation seen in the light curves obtained from aperture photometry ( figure  [ fig : spitz - ch4 ] ) is likely due to a pixellation effect rather than an intra - pixel inhomogeneity in irac s 8  detector response . during aperture photometry of the 8  data , an aperture radius of only 1.6 pixels",
    "the calculation of a circular aperture is non - trivial and the majority of photometry routines make a polygonal approximation , which tends to be less accurate for smaller radii . aside from that the calculation of how much flux should be attributed to partial pixels is another potential source of error .",
    "a better result is obtained if a psf is used , rather than if uniform illumination is assumed , but even that is not perfect .",
    "partial deconvolution is a photometric method that is optimal in a least - squares sense , i.e. the background contribution is minimized because each pixel is properly weighted . as this is not the case for aperture photometry , and",
    "as the background at 8  is bright relative to the target , we had to use a small aperture to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of our measurements , leading to pixelisation effects that translated into a correlation of the measured flux with detector position .",
    "we performed a combined mcmc analysis incorporating the decphot 8   light curves , which were detrended with equation  [ eqn : ch4 ] .",
    "the raw and detrended data are shown with the best - fitting trend and occultation models in figure  [ fig : spitz - ch4 ] .",
    "we found consistent 8  occultation depths when incorporating only one dataset or both datasets in our analysis ( table  [ tab : decphot - depths ] ) .",
    "the residuals of the decphot light curves exhibit a slightly smaller scatter than the aperture photometry light curves do ( figure  [ fig : spitz - ch4 ] ; table  [ tab : decphot - depths ] ) . these decphot depths and associated uncertainties",
    "are in close agreement with those derived using the light curves obtained from simple aperture photometry ( table  [ tab : decphot - depths ] ) .",
    "this is also the case for ,  and the time of mid - occultation ( table  [ tab : ecc ] ) .",
    "thus our method of obtaining 8  light curves by simple aperture photometry and detrending them with detector position is verified , and it is these light curves that we use in the simultaneous analysis from which we calculated our system parameter values .      in our simultaneous mcmc analysis we partitioned the wasp photometry according to observation season and camera into five datasets , so that each dataset could thus be normalised independently , as was done in a10 . as in t10 , we partitioned the rv data into four datasets : coralie data sampling the full orbit ( @xmath26 ) ; harps data sampling the full orbit ( @xmath27 ) ; a spectroscopic transit and a week of adjoining data as measured by coralie ( @xmath28 ) ; a spectroscopic transit and two rvs from the following day as measured by harps ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "both an instrumental offset and a specific stellar activity level have the potential to affect the measured rv of a star .",
    "the spectroscopic transits comprise a large number of rvs taken in quick succession , whereas the data sampling the full orbit were taken over a long time span and are thus expected to sample a range of stellar activity level that should average to a mean value of zero ( t10 ) .",
    "thus , by partioning the rv data , we allow each dataset to have its own centre - of - mass velocity @xmath30 , thus avoiding the risk of obtaining spurious values for the planet s mass and orbital eccentricity .      we scaled the photometric error bars so as to obtain a reduced @xmath31 of unity , applying one scale factor per dataset .",
    "the aim was to properly weight each dataset in the simultaneous mcmc analysis and to obtain realistic uncertainties .",
    "for the five sets of wasp photometry the scale factors were in the range 0.870.96 .",
    "the error bars of the euler photometry were multiplied by 1.33 .",
    "the scale factors for the occultation photometry were in the range 1.041.09 .",
    "importantly , the error bars of the occultation photometry were not scaled when deciding which trend models or aperture radii to use .",
    "we assessed the presence of correlated noise in the _ spitzer _ and euler data by plotting the rms of their binned residuals ( figure  [ fig : resids ] ) . though there is no",
    "correlated noise evident in the _ spitzer _ data , it is present at a small level in the euler data over time - scales of 880 minutes . due to the similarity with the time - scales of the fitted features in the transit",
    "( ingress takes 36 minutes , as does egress , and the transit duration is 264 minutes ) , the values of some fitted parameters may be affected to a small degree .    for the same reasons as with the photometry",
    ", we added a jitter term in quadrature to the formal radial velocity errors , as might arise from stellar activity .",
    "we used an initial mcmc run to determine the level of jitter required for each dataset to obtain a reduced @xmath31 of unity .",
    "we found that the harps orbital data ( @xmath27 ) required a jitter of 3  and the harps spectroscopic transit data ( @xmath29 ) required a jitter of 20 .",
    "it was not necessary to add any jitter to either of the two coralie datasets .    ) and the existing euler photometry ( lower panel ) .",
    "the solid black lines , which are the rms of the unbinned data scaled by the square root of the number of points in each bin , show the white - noise expectation .",
    "the ranges of bin widths ( 1250 minutes for _ spitzer _ and 2.5180 minutes for euler ) are appropriate for the datasets cadences and durations .",
    "[ fig : resids],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the euler photometry and the coralie rvs are in the bjd ( utc ) time system .",
    "the wasp and _ spitzer _ photometry are in the hjd ( utc ) time system .",
    "the difference between bjd and hjd is less than 4  s and so is negligible for our purposes .",
    "although leap second adjustments are made to the utc system to keep it close to mean solar time , meaning one should really use terrestrial time , our observations span a short baseline ( 20062008 ) , during which there were no leap second adjustments .",
    "the occultation of wasp-17b occurs farther away from us than its transit does , so we made a first order correction for the light travel time .",
    "we calculated the light travel time between the beginning of occultation ingress and the beginning of transit ingress to be 50.4 s. we subtracted this from the mid - exposure times of the _ spitzer _ occultation photometry . as we measure the time of mid - occultation to a precision of @xmath32 s , the impact of this correction was small .",

    "@xcite and @xcite used a coupled radius - orbit evolutionary model to show that planet radii can be inflated to 2  and beyond during a transient phase of heating caused by tidal circularisation of a short ( @xmath5 ) , highly eccentric ( @xmath6 ) orbit .",
    "though , as was noted in both studies , planets can persist in an inflated state for gyr beyond the circularisation of their orbit and the cessation of tidal heating , they do cool and contract significantly prior to full circularisation . in each study the orbits are still significantly non - circular ( @xmath10 ) when the planets are largest .",
    "thus , under the transient heating scenario , the very largest planets are expected to have a non - zero eccentricity . though we do measure a non - zero eccentricity for wasp-17b , it is small , and the stringent upper limit that we place on @xmath60 is inconsistent with current models of one transient phase of tidal heating .",
    "other than transient heating , ongoing tidal heating may occur if the orbit of a planet were kept non - circular by the continuing interaction with a third body @xcite",

    "the atmospheric opacities of wasp-17b may be enchaned if , for example , the strong optical and uv irradiation of the planet by its host star produces thick hazes , absorbing clouds and non - equilibrium chemical species ( e.g. tholins or polyacetylenes ) .",
    "the bloated planets are all very strongly irradiated by their host stars , and a small fraction of stellar insolation energy would be sufficient to account for the observed degrees of bloating . suggested that the kinetic energy of strong winds , induced in the atmosphere of a short - period planet by the large day - night temperature contrasts that result from tidal locking , may be transported downward and deposited as thermal energy in the deep interior .",

    "however , @xcite suggest that , for a planet with the insolation level of wasp-17b , it is unlikely that a temperature inversion could be caused by the presence of tio and vo in the upper atmosphere .",
    "they find that a cold trap exists between the hot convection zone and the hot upper atmosphere on the irradiated day side , in which titanium is likely to form condensates that settle more strongly than does gasesous tio . therefore , unless there is extremely vigorous macroscopic mixing and the condensed ti is lofted back in to the upper atmosphere then it is unlikely that tio can explain the observed temperature inversions .",
    "not only does vo have the same ` cold trap ' issue , but it also has a lower opacity than tio and is an order of magnitude less abundant .",
    "@xcite suggest that planets orbiting chromospherically active stars do not have temperature inversions , and planets orbiting quieter stars do have inversions .",

    "the upper limit placed on the lithium abundance (  @xmath164 ) in a10 is consistent with this .",

    "the stringent upper limit we have placed on eccentricity suggests that a transient phase of tidal heating alone could not have inflated the planet to its measured radius . nor could ongoing tidal heating involving a third body , unless the planetary tidal quality factor is smaller than the best theoretical and empirical determinations .",
    "we find no evidence in the radial velocity measurements for a third body in the system , the presence of which would be necessary to excite the eccentricity of wasp-17b for tidal heating to be ongoing , and may have been necessary to misalign the planet s orbital axis with the spin axis of the star .",
