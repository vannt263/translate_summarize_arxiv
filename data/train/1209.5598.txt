    "relational data mining approaches @xcite look for patterns that involve multiple tables in the database .",
    "important issues include relational association rule discovery ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , relational decision trees ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and relational distance - based learning ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these issues are undoubtedly more general and more challenging than their counterparts on a single data table .",
    "therefore they become popular in recent years .",
    "people have proposed various types of relational association rules for different applications .",
    "for example , dehaspe et al .",
    "@xcite chained binary relations to produce ternary relations , quaternary relations , etc , and then constructed rules from new relations .",
    "jensen et al .",
    "@xcite joined a number of primary tables through the central relationship table , and then constructed rules from the new table .",
    "goethals et al .",
    "@xcite constructed rules from two queries , where one asks for a set of tuples satisfying a certain condition , and the other asks for those tuples satisfying a more specific condition .",
    "kavurucu et al .",
    "@xcite employed relational association rule mining techniques to build a predicative concept learning inductive logic programming ( ilp ) system .",
    "goethals et al .",
    "@xcite also constructed rules from frequent itemsets across entities and binary relations , with a key specified such that the occurrences of itemsets are counted in one entity table .",
    "these rules are usually evaluated through two measures , namely _ support _ and _ confidence _ , which are well defined for association rules @xcite in a single data table .",
    "unfortunately , these two measures may not be enough to describe the strength of a relational association rule .",
    "for example , according to @xcite we may obtain a rule ",
    "75% female professors teach courses with 10 credits , among 30% of all courses . \" in fact , a professor may teach only one course with 10 credits , or she may teach all courses with 10 credits . neither measure distinguishes this kind of difference .    in this paper , we introduce granular association rules with four measures to reveal connections between granules in two universes .",
    "the term  granular \" comes from granular computing @xcite , which is an emerging conceptual and computing paradigm of information processing @xcite .",
    "let us consider a many - to - many entity - relationship system with two entities ` customer ` and ` product ` connected by a relation ` buys ` .",
    " men , \"  young men , \" and  chinese women \" are granules of customers .  alcohol , \"  france alcohol , \" and  white stuff \" are granules of products . examples of granular association rules include  men like alcohol , \"  young men like france alcohol , \" and  chinese women like white stuff . \" from the viewpoint of granular computing , these rules are partial ordered .",
    "the first rule is _ coarser _ than the second one , because  men \" is coarser than  young men , \" and  alcohol \" is coarser than  france alcohol . \"",
    "the third rule is neither finer nor coarser than the second one .",
    "granular association rules are useful in both data mining applications and the granular computing theory .",
    "first , granular association rules can be employed to build recommender systems @xcite . unlike existing collaborative recommendation @xcite or collaborative filtering @xcite approaches which consider a customer s shopping history , granular association rules recommend products according to her basic information such as gender , age , etc .",
    "hence they are especially useful in dealing with the _ cold start _ problem @xcite , where the customer or the product has just entered the system .",
    "second , most existing works of granular computing focus on one universe",
    ". only a few works of granular computing discusses two universes ( see .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) , let alone respective applications . consequently , granular association rules might be a new research trend of granular computing theory and application .",
    "we propose four measures to evaluate the quality of a granular association rule .",
    "an example of such a rule might be ",
    "40% men like at least 30% kinds of alcohol ; 45% customers are men and 6% products are alcohol . \" here 45% , 6% , 40% , and 30% are the _ source coverage _ , the _ target coverage _ , the _ source confidence _ , and the _ target confidence _ , respectively .",
    "the _ support _ measure , which is well defined for other association rules , is redundant since it is equal to the product of the source coverage and the source confidence . with these four measures ,",
    "the strength of the rule is well defined .",
    "this is one reason why the new type of rules are semantically richer than most of existing ones .",
    "the reason lies in that the new type is more specific than some existing ones which span across more than two universes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or even the whole database ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in some cases the source confidence and/or the target confidence might be 100% , resulting in three subtypes with some properties . when the source confidence is 100% , the rule",
    "is called a right - hand side partial match one . when the target confidence is 100% , the rule",
    "is called a left - hand side partial match one .",
    "when both measures are 100% , the rule is called a complete match one . in correspondence with these terms , when neither measure is 100% , the rule is called a partial match one .",
    "we may also view partial match rules as a general case without requirements on the source confidence and the target confidence .",
    "our objective is to mine all granular association rules satisfying thresholds of four measures .",
    "we design a sandwich rule mining algorithm for this purpose . with this algorithm ,",
    "candidate granules are generated in each universe according to the source coverage and target coverage thresholds using existing algorithms such as apriori @xcite or fp - growth @xcite .",
    "then candidate rules are generated and checked .",
    "rules meeting the source confidence and the target confidence thresholds are output .",
    "the rule checking approach for partial match rules is inefficient for other subtypes .",
    "therefore we design different rule checking approaches for three subtypes to fully take advantage of their characteristics .",
    "we also design two more algorithms to mine complete matching rules .",
    "they are called the forward algorithm and the backward algorithm , respectively . lower approximation , which is a key concept in rough sets @xcite , is employed to analyze both algorithms . hence granular association rule mining can be viewed as a new application of rough sets .",
    "experiments are undertaken on the movielens @xcite data set assembled by the grouplens project @xcite and the course selection data from zhangzhou normal university .",
    "some interesting rules are obtained through setting reasonable thresholds of four measures .",
    "the tradeoff between the source confidence and the target confidence of a rule is illustrated .",
    "the efficiencies of different approaches are compared through different settings on four thresholds . for the sandwich algorithm ,",
    "rule checking approaches designed for three subtypes are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude faster than the one for the general case .",
    "moreover , a forward algorithm and a backward algorithm , which are valid for complete matching , can enhance the performance further .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : related - works ] reviews three types of classical association rules and four types of relational association rules .",
    "section [ section : granular - rules ] defines the data model for granular association rules and three subtypes of rules .",
    "then section [ section : algorithms ] defines the problem and presents a sandwich algorithm for the problem . a forward algorithm and a backward algorithm are also designed to mine complete match rules .",
    "experiments on the course selection data are discussed in section [ section : experiments ] .",
    "finally , section [ section : conclusion ] presents the concluding remarks and further research directions .",
    "in this section , we review popular association rule mining problems and respective approaches",
    ". we will begin with association rules in a single data table , and then proceed to association rules involving multiple tables .",
    "association rules on a _ single _ data table have been well - studied . these are boolean association rules , quantitative association rules , and multi - level association rules .",
    "the concept of association rule was first introduced in @xcite to mine transaction data of a supermarket .",
    "this concept was renamed as _ boolean association rule _",
    "@xcite to distinguish with other types of association rules .",
    "the transaction data , also called the basket data , store items purchased on a per - transaction basis .",
    "an example of such rule is ",
    "30% of transactions that contain beer also contain diapers ; 2% of all transactions contain both of these items . \" here 30% and 2% are the _ confidence _ and the _ support _ , respectively of the rule .    from the set point of view",
    ", boolean association rules reveal the connection between two disjoint subsets of the same universe .",
    "let the number of transactions be @xmath0 and the number of items be @xmath1 , the basket data can be stored in an information table with @xmath0 rows and @xmath1 columns .",
    "each datum in the data table is boolean to specify whether or not an item is included in the respective transaction .",
    "this is why the rules are called boolean association rules .",
    "the apriori @xcite algorithm is based on the apriori property @xcite .",
    "it can mine all boolean association rules efficiently given the threshold of support and confidence .",
    "the fp - growth @xcite algorithm avoids candidate generation and therefore save computation time further .",
    "quantitative association rule @xcite was introduced to cope with data tables with quantitative attribute values . from the data type point of view , it is a generalization of the boolean association rule .",
    "it reveals the relationships among attribute values of an object . a well known application is mining information of people .",
    "an example of such rule is ",
    "10% of married people between age 50 and 60 have at least 2 cars ; 3% of all people queried satisfy this rule \" @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of boolean association rules , here 10% is called the _ confidence _ of the rule , and 3% is the _ support _ of the rule .    since the apriori property still holds in the new context , the apriori algorithm can be designed accordingly @xcite .",
    "one can also follow the idea of fp - growth to design a more efficient algorithm .",
    "multi - level association rules @xcite reside at multiple concept levels to discover more specific and concrete knowledge from data .",
    "in addition to the transaction data , it requires a description table to indicate different levels .",
    "suppose that category , content and brand represent the first , the second , and the third level concept respectively of a food .",
    "two examples of such rules are  75% of people buy wheat bread if they buy 2% milk , \" and  82% of people buy bread if they buy 2% milk .",
    "\" however , the rule  60% of people buy products made of wheat if they buy 2% milk \" is invalid since  products made of wheat \" does not indicate the category .      in recent years , multi - relational data mining ( mrdm ) @xcite , also called relational data mining ( rdm ) , has been proposed to look for patterns that involve multiple tables .",
    "accordingly , the concept of association rule has been extended with this regard to form relational association rules .",
    "there are various extensions , and we will discuss more popular ones .",
    "dehaspe et al .",
    "@xcite , deroski et al .",
    "@xcite , and afrati et al .",
    "@xcite considered the case where binary relations can be chained to produce ternary relations , quaternary relations , etc .",
    "suppose there are two binary relations , namely the parent - child relation and child - pet relation .",
    "a parent - child - pet relation can be produced using a sql query on the database .",
    "an example of such rule is  if a person has a child , then this child has a pet with a probability of 30% ; 20% of all people satisfy this rule . \" here 30% is called the _ confidence _ of the rule , and 20% is the _ support _ of the rule .",
    "we will call this type of rules _ extended boolean association rules _ since they can be viewed a direct extension of boolean association rules on a single table . the information carried by such rules",
    "is quite limited .",
    "they can not indicate the number of children a person has , or the number of pets a child has .",
    "nor can they specify other information , such as the age , of a parent or a child .    dehaspe et al .",
    "@xcite designed a general purpose inductive logic programming algorithm called warmr to mine this type of rules .",
    "afrati et al .",
    "@xcite also tried to attack this problem using integer programming and graph approaches .",
    "jensen et al .",
    "@xcite considered the case of decentralize tables . in this case",
    "the database contains @xmath0 primary tables ( i.e. , tables with one primary key ) , and one central relationship table ( i.e. , a table with @xmath0 foreign keys ) .",
    "an example of such rule is  if the atm type is drive , then the age of the customer is between 20 and 29 .",
    "\" the computation of the confidence and support measures is the same as the table joined from all @xmath2 tables .",
    "we will call this type of rules _ decentralized association rules_. in fact , if @xmath3 , the database represents a many - to - many relation , which is quite typical",
    ". however , in real applications a central relationship table seldom exists for @xmath4",
    ". therefore these rules are valid for very special databases , or parts of a database .",
    "goethals et al .",
    "@xcite considered mining association rules in arbitrary relational databases .",
    "this approach looks for pairs of sql queries @xmath5 and @xmath6 , such that  @xmath5 asks for a set of tuples satisfying a certain condition and @xmath6 asks for those tuples satisfying a more specific condition \" @xcite . when the number of tuples matching @xmath6 is close to that of @xmath5 , a rule is created .",
    "an example of such rule is  actors starring in ` drama ' movies typically ( with a probability of 90% ) also star in a ` comedy ' movie . \"",
    "we will call this type of rules _ simple conjunctive association rules_. the conjunction here is much more flexible than the case of extended boolean association rules .",
    "in fact , any kind of sql query is supported .",
    "goethals et al .",
    "@xcite designed the conqueror algorithm to mine this type of rules .",
    "goethals et al .",
    "@xcite also considered a more specific type of association rules .",
    "the frequency of a rule is not counted as the number of occurrences in the join of tables .",
    "let the database consist tables ` professor ` , ` course ` and ` student ` .",
    "for one particular kind of courses , the number of professors who teach them and the number of students who study them are counted separately .",
    "an example of such rule is ",
    "75% professors named jan teaches courses with 10 credits , among 30% of all courses . \" here 75% is the _ confidence _ and 30% is the _ relative support_.    we will call this type of rules _ separated counting association rules_. unfortunately , the counting mechanism is limited .",
    "for example , a professor may teach only one course with 10 credits , or she may teach all courses with 10 credits",
    ". this type of rules does not contain such information .",
    "unfortunately , there are at least two drawbacks of existing relational association rule mining works .",
    "first , the general relational association rule mining problem usually involves the join operation of multiple data tables @xcite . when the sizes of these data tables are large , it is simply impossible to join more than two tables .",
    "second , as the association rule becomes more complex in the context of rdm , the support and confidence measures are not enough to evaluate the strength of the rule .",
    "in this section , we will introduce granular association rules to address the drawbacks of existing types mentioned in the last section .",
    "we will first discuss the data model for the new type .",
    "then we present three subtypes of rules and one general case corresponding to four different explanations of granular association rules . at the same time , a number of measures are proposed to evaluate the quality of these rules .",
    "a comprehensive comparison with existing types will be made at the end of the section .",
    "first we revisit the definitions of information systems binary relations . at the same time",
    "we discuss granules in information systems .",

    "one important reason is that rule checking terminates once certain conditions are met , therefore introducing much uncertainty to the run time .",
    "consequently , the time complexities are for reference only , and the run time depends more on the characteristics of data",
    ". this might be a common phenomenon for data mining algorithms .",
    "it is very interesting to observe for the movielens dataset , the sandwich algorithm performs best .",
    "there are at least two reasons .",
    "first , due to threshold settings and data sizes , the movielens dataset generally requires not too many operations .",
    "second , the the sandwich algorithm has a simpler mechanism than the other two . to sum up",
    ", the backward algorithm is more scalable .",
    "however for small datasets and large thresholds , the sandwich is more efficient .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed granular association rules to reveal many - to - many relationships in relational databases .",
    "they have wide applications such as collaborative recommendation @xcite and collaborative filtering @xcite .",
    "four measures have been defined to evaluate the quality of these rules .",
    "therefore the new type of rules is semantically richer than existing ones .",
    "we also proposed three algorithms for association rule mining , and compared algorithm efficiency through experimentation .",
    "the following research topics deserve further investigation :    1 .",
    "different types of data for object description . in this work we considered only symbolic data for describing objects .",
    "it is necessary to consider numeric data , heterogenous data @xcite , interval valued @xcite data and data with missing values @xcite .",
    "there are some neighborhood systems concerning distance @xcite or error ranges @xcite to formalize these data .",
    "respective approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) can be also employed for these issues .",
    "moreover , there might be test cost while obtaining data @xcite .",
    "hence we should also consider cost data in certain applications .",
    "2 .   different granular association rule mining problems . in the problem definition of this paper ,",
    "four thresholds are needed as the input .",
    "we may provide other means of parameter setting for non - expert users .",
    "for example , we may mine top-@xmath82 interesting rules where @xmath82 is easy to specify .",
    "we may need to remove redundant rules @xcite and common sense rules to avoid pattern explosion @xcite .",
    "efficient algorithms to these problems . as discussed in section [ section : algorithms ] , the time complexities of proposed algorithms are rather high . for datasets with hundreds of thousands of objects , these algorithms may take too much time .",
    "therefore we need to improve the speed of the algorithms dramatically through taking fully advantage of the apriori property indicated in section [ section : algorithms ] .",
    "rough sets approach to association rule mining @xcite may be also employed for this purpose . moreover , since our algorithms are essentially exhaustive ones , it may be even necessary to design heuristic algorithms for large datasets .",
    "consequently , we may design heuristic algorithms @xcite to these problems .",
    "theoretical foundations of these problems and algorithms .",
    "the forward and the backward algorithms make use of granule approximation from the viewpoint of rough sets @xcite , especially the one for two universes @xcite .",
    "these two algorithms consider only complete matching rules ; therefore the classical rough set model is employed . for the general case and two other subtypes",
    ", we may need variable precision rough sets @xcite or decision theoretical rough sets @xcite .",
    "there are at least two types of coverings induced by binary relations in this scenario .",
    "the first type of coverings is induced by binary relations .",
    "given an element in one universe , the binary relation always induces a subset in other . in this way , from all elements in one universe , a cover of the other universe is induced .",
    "the second type of coverings is induced by granular association rules .",
    "either side of a rule corresponds to a granule , which describes a covering block .",
    "covering - based rough sets @xcite are a natural approach for these issues .",
    "extension to more than two universes . from the viewpoints of both theory and application ,",
    "it is very important to generalize the approach to more than two universes .",
    "let us consider three universes ` customer ` , ` product ` , and ` supplier ` , and two binary relations ` buys ` and ` supplied - by ` .",
    "we may chain @xmath92 granular association rules from @xmath92 mmers into one .",
    "for example , we may have the following association rule ",
    "40% men like at least 30% kinds of alcohol , 25% alcohol are supplied by at least 35% china wine factories . \" in this way , mining granular association rules from @xmath0 universes is decomposed into @xmath92 subtasks .",
    "we may also multiply the boolean relation matrices to produce a direct relation between the first and the @xmath0-th universe .",
    "for example , we may multiply ` buys ` and ` supplied - by ` , and produce a direct relation between ` customer ` and ` supplier ` . in this way , mining a granular association rule from @xmath0 universes is converted into the problem of the paper . more complex approaches may produce more flexible rules .",
    "bipartite graph .",
    "the relation @xmath39 corresponds with a bipartite graph . with the extension from @xmath39 to the mmer @xmath93",
    ", the nodes of graphs are represented through blocks .",
    "therefore new concepts should be introduced and new characteristics should be analyzed .    to sum up , granular association rule mining is a challenging problem due to pattern explosion @xcite .",
    "it may benefit from rough sets , especially variable precision rough sets @xcite and covering - based rough sets @xcite .",
    "therefore this work has opened a new research trend concerning granular computing , association rule mining , and rough sets .",
