    "@xcite ) , which still is submitted to big uncertainties , especially at high redshift . in particular",
    ", it is possible that the optically derived star formation rate is under - estimated , due to dust obscuration , and that only infrared / submm surveys could give the correct information ( guiderdoni et al .",

    "this review focus on the dust and molecular content of galaxies , as a way to trace the evolution of star formation , and to detect the location of starbursts as a function of redshift .",
    "first the present state of knowledge is detailed , concerning co emission lines as well as dust continuum , and their interpretation is discussed ( respective role of starburst and agn for instance ) .",
    "then perspectives are drawn concerning the future surveys that will be conducted with the next generation of millimeter instruments .",

    "1992 ) , has opened a new way of research to tackle the star formation history of the universe .",
    "although the object turned out to be highly gravitationally amplified , it revealed however that galaxies at this epoch could have large amounts of molecular gas , excited by an important starburst , and sufficiently metal - enriched to emit detectable co emission lines . the latter bring fundamental information about the cold gas component in high - z objects and therefore about the physical conditions of the formation of galaxies and the first generations of stars . at high enough redshifts ,",
    "most of the galaxy mass could be molecular .",
    "the main problem to detect this molecular component could be its low metallicity , but theoretical calculations have shown that in a violent starburst , the metallicity could reach solar values very quickly ( elbaz et al . 1992 ) .",
    "after the first discovery , many searches for other candidates took place , but they were harder than expected , and only a few , often gravitationally amplified , objects have been detected : the lensed cloverleaf quasar h 1413 + 117 at @xmath2 ( barvainis et al . 1994 ) , the lensed radiogalaxy mg0414 + 0534 at @xmath3 ( barvainis et al .",

    "if the non - amplification is confirmed , these objects would contain the largest molecular contents known ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 with a standard co / h@xmath12 conversion ratio , and even more if the metallicity is low ) .",
    "the derived molecular masses are so high that h@xmath12 would constitute between 30 to 80% of the total dynamical mass ( according to the unknown inclination ) , if the standard co / h@xmath12 conversion ratio was adopted .",
    "the application of this conversion ratio is however doubtful , and it is possible that the involved h@xmath12 masses are 3 - 4 times lower ( solomon et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the co line detections at high @xmath13 up to now are summarized in table [ codata ] , and the molecular masses as a function of redshift are displayed in fig .",
    "it is clear from this figure that our present sensitivity prevents detection of co lines above a redshift of 0.4 , unless the objects are lensed ; but this will rapidly change with the new millimeter instruments planned over the world ( the green - bank-100 m of nrao , the lmt-50 m of umass - inaoe , the alma ( europe / usa ) and the lmsa ( japan ) interferometers ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to predict with simple models the detection capabilities , as a function of redshift , metallicity or physical conditions in the high - z objects . in particular",

    "1992 , 1993 , 1998 [ tababs ]    the utility of molecular absorption lines comes from the high sensitivity . due to the small extent of the background continuum source ,",

    "molecular absorption lines are as easy to detect at z@xmath691 as at z@xmath695 , provided the continuum sources exist . then , direct opacity are measured , and it is almost as easy to detect many high dipole molecules , ( hco@xmath70 or hcn ) as co.    about 15 different molecules have been detected in absorption at high redshifts , in a total of 30 different transitions .",
    "this allows a detailed chemical study and comparison with local clouds . within the large dispersion in column densities , and in molecular cloud properties",
    ", the high redshift systems do not appear to be different from local ones , suggesting that the conditions for star formation are the same up to z@xmath71 as at the present .",
    "a systematic survey for absorption lines has also been undertaken in front of about a hundred continuum sources candidates , selected from flat  spectrum continuum sources .",
    "the continuum needs to be at least 0.2 jy to allow detection of intervening molecular gas .",
    "the redshift of the absorbing candidate is known , either from previously detected hi absorption , or from optical lines emission . when the continuum source is strong enough ,",
    "at least 1 jy , and no redshift is known , it is possible to search for absorption lines by scanning in frequency ( cf .",
    "wiklind & combes @xcite ) .",
    "this last method is the most promising with the new generation millimeter instruments , that will gain an order of magnitude in sensitivity . indeed ,",
    "the best candidates are the most obscured ones , where no redshift is available .",
    "a lot more absorption systems could be found with the future instruments , at faint continuum flux , since the number counts of quasars are a non - linear function of flux and the local luminosity function is steep ( see peacock @xcite ) .",
    "however , the flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars distribution is decreasing sharply at @xmath71 ( shaver et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and this is not likely due to obscuration , since they are radio - selected quasars .",
    "if quasars are associated to galaxy formation and interactions , this tends to show that the decrease of star - formation rate beyond @xmath72 is real and not an extinction effect .",
    "the relative absence of strong continuum radio sources at high redshift will not help the tracing of protogalaxies through absorption techniques .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies over the radio , mm and fir domains has a characteristic maximum around 60 - 100 @xmath73 m due to dust heated by newly born stars , and the interstellar radiation field ( see fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "this maximum depends on the dust temperature , and the curve is that of a grey - body , where the optical thickness can be modelled by a power - law in frequency , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , according to the nature of dust . in the rayleigh - jeans domain ( frequencies lower than the maximum )",
    ", the flux increases almost as @xmath76 , and this creates what is called a negative k - correction , i.e. it begins to be more easy to detect objects at high redshift than low redshift , at a given frequency , and sky surveys could be dominated by remote objects ( see e.g. blain & longair @xcite ) .",
    "the source counts could be inverted in favor of high - redshift objects , if they exist in equal numbers ( not depopulated by strong evolution effects ) .",
    "the millimeter domain becomes then a privileged tool to tackle galaxy formation .    in fig .",
    "[ sed ] , we see that at low frequency ( lower than 100 ghz , or 3 mm in wavelength ) , the radio spectrum is due to synchrotron processes .",
    "there is a marked flux minimum that can be used as a redshift indicator ( e.g. carilli & yun @xcite ; blain @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , there is a well - known tight correlation between the synchrotron radio power and the far - infrared emission in star - forming galaxies ( condon @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation is thought to arise because both fir and non - thermal radio emission are both directly proportionnal to recent star - formation ( the fir being a good measure of massive stars luminosity , and the radio of the rate of supernovae ) .",
    "however , the z - indicator is somewhat ambiguous , since there is a degeneracy between increasing the redshift or decreasing the dust temperature .",
    "the bulk of the high redshift galaxies presently known have been discovered in optical .",
    "but these surveys could have missed dust - enshrouded starbursts , since we now know that dust and high metallicity occur very early in the universe ( cf . the previous sections ) .",
    "submm and fir deep surveys are then the best strategy to detect starbursting proto - galaxies , and many such works have been undertaken , either with sensitive array - bolometers on single dishes ( iram-30 m , scuba on jcmt , ... ) mm - interferometers , or with isophot and isocam on board of iso satellite .",

    "the amplification is in average a factor 2 .",
    "this has the combined advantage to increase the sensitivity , and to reduce the source confusion , since there should be little contamination from cluster galaxies ( blain @xcite ) .",
    "a large number of sources were found , all at large redshifts ( @xmath77 ) , extrapolated to 2000 sources per square degree ( above 4mjy ) , revealing a large positive evolution with redshift , i.e. an increase of starbursting galaxies .",
    "searches toward the hubble deep field - north ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) , and towards the lockman hole and ssa13 ( barger et al .",
    "@xcite ) , have also found a few sources , allowing to derive a similar density of sources : 800 per square degree , above 3 mjy at 850 @xmath73 m .",
    "this already can account for 50% of the cosmic infra - red background ( cirb ) , that has been estimated by puget et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from cobe data .",
    "the photometric redshifts of these sources range between 1 and 3 .",
    "their identification with optical objects might be uncertain ( richards @xcite ) .",
    "however , hughes et al . (",
    "1998 ) claim that the star formation rate derived from the far - infrared might be in some cases 10 times higher than derived from the optical , due to the high extinction .",
    "eales et al .",
    "( 1999 ) surveyed some of the cfrs fields at 850@xmath73 m with scuba and found also that the sources can account for a significant fraction of the cirb background ( @xmath7 30% ) .",
    "their interpretation in terms of the star formation history is however slightly different , in that they do not exclude that the submm luminosity density could evolve in the same way as the uv one .",
    "deep galaxy surveys at 7 and 15@xmath73 m with isocam also see an evolution with redshift of star - forming galaxies : heavily extincted starbursts represent less than 1% of all galaxies , but 18% of the star formation rate out to @xmath78 ( flores et al .",
    "1999 ) .    now that a few dozens of submm sources have been catalogued ( barger et al .",
    "@xcite , smail et al .",
    "1999 ) , the count rates are confirmed , i.e. @xmath7 1000 source per square degree , above 3 mjy , at 850 @xmath73 m , and even 8000 above 1 mjy , from the gravitationally amplified cluster fields ( blain et al .",
    "the cumulative count rate can be fitted by a power - law , above 2 mjy , with a slope of -2.2 .",
    "the main difficulty appears to be the identification of the submm sources with optical or radio counterparts : the spatial resolution of the submm surveys are several arcsecs , with sometimes systematic uncertainties , and some of the previous claimed identifications have been reconsidered ( e.g. barger et al .",
    "@xcite , downes et al .",
    "@xcite ) . follow - up in the radio ( co lines ) or near - infrared , or optical to find redshifts , are much slower than the surveys themselves .",

    "@xcite had identified extremely red objects that are conspicuous only in the near - infrared , and have r - k colors larger than 5 .",
    "the ero class could include several categories of objects : essentially old stellar populations at high redshift , or high-@xmath13 dust - reddened starbursts ( hu & ridgway @xcite ; cowie et al .",
    "maybe 10% of the submm sources could be eros ( smail et al .",
    "a proto - typical ero at @xmath13=1.44 ( dey et al .",
    "@xcite ) has been detected in submm continuum ( cimatti et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and has been found to be an ultraluminous starburst shrouded by dust , with a star formation rate of 200 - 500 m@xmath11 per yr .",
    "the surface density of such eros at k @xmath48 20 and color r - k @xmath62 6 is about 500 per square degree , and for r - k @xmath62 7 , about 50 per square degree ( which is comparable to the number of qso with b @xmath48 21.5 , andreani et al .",
    "@xcite ) . at least for the few objects known",
    ", the agn can not be the source of the huge luminosity , given the fir / radio ratio .      for a long time ,",
    "the highest redshift objects known were quasars , although now , with higher sensitivities , the situation is reversed ( e.g. hu et al .",
    "surveys have therefore been done in the millimeter continuum and lines for high - z quasars ( mcmahon et al .",
    "@xcite ; isaak et al .",
    "@xcite ; omont et al .",
    "@xcite ; guilloteau et al .",
    "results have shown that the far - infrared luminosities of many of them are due to dust heated by a starburst , although the agn activity is simultaneously present .",
    "but since the manifestations of the two nuclear activities ( starburst or agn ) are in many cases similar , and are most of the time associated , it has become a controversial question to disentangle the two interpretations .",
    "ultra - luminous starbursts take place over the few central 100pc ( solomon et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and even pure agn activities can be mimicked by radio supernovae ( boyle & terlevich @xcite ) .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "@xcite from iso mid - infrared diagrams concluded that the ultra - luminous galaxies are powered at 30% from agn and 70% from star formation ; a similar conclusion is suggested by cooray & haiman @xcite for submm catalogued sources .",
    "mcmahon et al .",
    "@xcite however suggest that a much more significant fraction of submm sources , between 15 to 100% , could be agn - powered .",
    "note that distinction criteria are hard to find ( cf .",
    "stein @xcite ) , and even symbiotic starburst - black hole models are likely ( williams et al .",
    "@xcite ) . discriminating between the two possibilities can have important consequences on the star formation history of the universe .",
    "one of the breakthrough due to recent progress on faint galaxies has been the inventory of the amount of star formation at every epoch ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "the comoving star formation rate is increasing like @xmath80 from @xmath81 to @xmath78 , and then decreases again to the same present value down to @xmath82 . but",
    "this relies on the optical studies , i.e. on the uv - determined star forming rates in the rest - frame .",
    "if early starbursts are dusty , this decrease could be changed into a plateau ( guiderdoni et al .",
    "@xcite ; blain et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since the agn - starbursts nature of the submm sources is still an open question , trentham et al . @xcite",
    "consider two extreme possibilities : either the submm faint galaxies are all dusty starbursts , but even then , they do not dominate the star formation rate in the madau plot at any redshift ; or they are dusty agn , and again they can not represent more than a few percents of the present density of dark objects , as inferred by magorrian et al . @xcite .",
    "if progenitors of quasars or protogalaxies form at high redshifts ( larger than 10 ) , then the millimeter domain is the best place to detect them ( loeb @xcite ; braine @xcite ) .",
    "both continuum and line emission could be detected , provided enough sensitivity , with about 10 times more collecting surface as present ones ( either with a single dish , as the gbt-100 m of nrao , or with the alma interferometer ) .",
    "as was clear in the previous sections , the detection of the submm continuum emission from actively star - forming objects at high redshifts is much easier than the co line detection .",
    "the line emission does not have such a negative k - correction , since in the low frequency domain , the flux of the successive lines increases roughly as @xmath83 ( optically thick domain ) , instead of @xmath84 for the continuum .",
    "nevertheless the line emission is essential to study the nature of the object ( the agn - starburst connection for instance ) , and deduce more physics ( kinematics , abundances , excitation , etc .. ) . given the gas and dust temperatures , the maximum flux is always reached at much lower frequencies than in the continuum , since the lines always reflect the energy difference between two levels ; this is an advantage , given the largest atmospheric opacity at high frequencies .",
    "the best tracer of molecular gas at large - scale is the co molecule , the most abundant after h@xmath12 .",
    "all other molecules will give weaker signals .",
    "the fine - structure cii line at 158 @xmath73 m , formed in pdr at the border of molecular clouds , is also thought to be a useful tool for proto - galaxies or proto - quasars ( loeb @xcite ) , but it has revealed disapointing in starbursts , or compact objects , due to optical thickness or inefficiency of gas heating ( e.g. malhotra et al .",
    "@xcite ) : the l@xmath85/l@xmath86 ratio decreases as l@xmath86/l@xmath87 increases .    to model high - redshift starburst objects ,",
    "let us extrapolate the properties of more local ones : the active region is generally confined to a compact nuclear disk , sub - kpc in size ( scoville et al .",
    "@xcite , solomon et al .",
    "the gas is much denser here than in average over a normal galaxy , of the order of 10@xmath88 @xmath89 , with clumps at least of 10@xmath90 @xmath89 to explain the data on high density tracers ( hcn , cs .. ) ; large gas masses can pile up in the center , due to torques exerted in galaxy interactions and mergers ( e.g. barnes & hernquist @xcite ) .",
    "to schematize , the ism maybe modelled by two density and temperature components , at 30 and 90k ( cf . combes et al .",
    "the total molecular mass considered will be @xmath91 m@xmath11 and the average column density n(h@xmath12 ) of 10@xmath20 @xmath21 , typical of the orion cloud center .",
    "going towards high redshift ( @xmath92 ) , the temperature of the cosmic background t@xmath93 becomes of the same order as the interstellar dust temperature , and the excitation of the gas by the background radiation competes with that of gas collisions .",
    "it might then appear easier to detect the lines ( silk & spaans @xcite ) , but this is not the case when every effect is taken into account .",
    "to have an idea of the increase of the dust temperature with @xmath13 , the simplest assumption is to consider the same heating power due to the starburst . at a stationary state , the dust must then radiate the same energy in the far - infrared that it receives from the stars , and this is proportional to the quantity @xmath94 , if the dust is optically thin , and its opacity varies in @xmath95 , with @xmath96 = 2 . keeping this quantity",
    "constant means that the energy re - radiated by the dust , proportional to @xmath97 , is always equal to the energy it received from the cosmic background , proportional to @xmath98 , plus the constant energy flux coming from the stars .",
    "since @xmath96 can also be equal to 1 or 1.5 , or the dust be optically thick , we have also considered the possibility of keeping @xmath99 constant ; this does not change fundamentally the results .",

    "[ cohz_39 ] .",
    "when comparing these predictions with the present instrumental sensitivities , it appears that the continuum is detectable at any redshift already , for an ultra - luminous source , while the line emission has to await the order of magnitude increase that will be provided by the next generation in the mm and sub - mm domains .",
    "the recent reported detections ( cf .",
    "table [ codata ] ) have been possible because of gravitational lens magnifications ( or maybe for 1 - 2 cases , an exceptional object ) .",

    "blain & longair @xcite ) .",
    "this gives the number of mergers at each epoch , but the efficiency of mergers in terms of star - formation must also vary considerably with redshift , with a peak at @xmath111 , to agree with the observations ( such as in fig .",
    "[ scount ] ) .",
    "also , the integration over all redshifts of the flux of all sources should agree with the cosmic infrared background detected by cobe ( fig .",
    "[ scount ] ) .",
    "these contribute to reduce the number of free parameters of the modelling .",
    "to fit the source counts , however , another parameter must be introduced which measures the rate of energy released in a merger ( or the life - time of the event ) : this rate must increase strongly with redshift ( cf .",
    "blain et al .",
    "once the counts are made compatible with the submm observations , the model indicates what must be the contributions of the various redshift classes to the present counts ( cf .",

    "it is interesting to note that the intermediate redshifts dominate the counts ( @xmath112 ) , if we allow the star formation to begin before @xmath113 . at higher dust temperature ,",
    "the counts are dominated by the highest redshifts ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "but these contributions depend strongly on the adopted shape of the star - forming efficiency versus @xmath13",
    ". observations of these counts and their redshift distribution will therefore bring a lot of insight in the physiscs of early protogalaxies .",
    "it is possible to derive also the source counts for the co line emission . the spectral energy distribution is now obtained with a comb - like function , representing the rotational ladder , convolved with a planck distribution of temperature equal to the dust temperature , assuming the lines optically thick .",
    "the frequency filling factor is then proportional to the rotational number , and therefore to the redshift , for a given observed frequency .",

    "if there were as many ultra - luminous starbursts at @xmath116 than at @xmath117 , the present sub - mm continuum surveys should have detected them ( there might still be identification problems , however ) . a good way to identify them",
    "is to search for molecular lines , but the present instruments are not yet sensitive enough , when they are not helped by gravitational lenses . with more than an order of magnitude sensitivity that will be available in the next decade , it will become possible to detect normal star - forming galaxies at high redshift , and even protogalaxies at @xmath118 .",
