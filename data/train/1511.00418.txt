    "random access protocols based on slotted aloha  @xcite are widely used in wireless communication systems in order to support uncoordinated transmissions from a large number of users .",
    "these protocols offer low latency in scenarios in which each user is only intermittently transmitting . in slotted aloha , time is divided into slots and users select a single slot at random for transmission .",
    "if two packets are transmitted in the same slot , the respective receiver observes a _ collision _ and the colliding packets are considered lost , which significantly limits the efficiency of slotted aloha .     in  @xcite",
    ", it was suggested to repeat packets twice in randomly selected slots , thus slightly increasing the probability of a successful transmission . in  @xcite , it was further suggested to utilize , as explained in the following .",
    "the system operates in _ frames _ , where each frame is a periodically occurring structure that consists of a predefined number of slots .",
    "all users are assumed to be frame - synchronized .",
    "each user transmits multiple copies ( two or three ) of its packet in a single frame , each copy in a different slot .",
    "each copy of a packet contains pointers to all other copies of a packet .",
    "once one copy is successfully received , the positions of the other copies are obtained and their interference in the respective slots is subtracted . exploiting in  @xcite provides significant performance improvement with respect to slotted aloha . is also used in many other applications , e.g. , @xcite to combat the hidden terminal problem in wireless networks , or in  @xcite , where it is combined with network coding .     in  @xcite",
    ", it was proposed to use different repetition factors for different users . to that end , users choose their repetition factor by drawing a random number according to a predefined distribution .",
    "it was recognized in  @xcite that for the described protocol is similar to decoding of graph - based codes over the binary erasure channel .",
    "hence , the theory of codes on graphs can be used to design good distributions . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that using the so - called soliton distribution allows transmitting one packet in each slot when the frame length goes to infinity , which can be seen as the `` capacity '' of the protocol in  @xcite .",
    "coding over packets was used in  @xcite in the protocol termed in order to achieve high efficiency under transmit energy constraints .",
    "a protocol without a fixed frame structure was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the protocols in  @xcite are designed for unicast transmission , i.e. , when several users transmit to a common receiver ( several receivers are possible in  @xcite ) .     in this paper",
    ", we consider a scenario where users exchange messages between each other , which is referred to as an _ all - to - all broadcast scenario_. this is a standard scenario used as a context for distributed consensus algorithms  @xcite .",
    "however , we chiefly draw our motivation from the emerging wireless scenario of , in which cars exchange safety messages .",
    "we propose a novel protocol based on , which we call .",
    "in particular , each user is equipped with a half - duplex transceiver , so that a user can not receive packets in the slots it uses for transmission .",
    "the half - duplex mode gives rise to a property : the more the user repeats its packet , the higher the chance for this packet to be decoded by other users , but the lower the number of available slots to receive in and , hence , the lower the chance to decode packets of others .",
    "the proposed protocol provides a reliable access for a large number of devices under strict latency constraints , thus satisfying the needs of and other applications of future communications systems  @xcite . since",
    "low latency is crucial in such applications , we analyze the performance of b - csa in the finite frame length regime , which causes the appearance of an in the performance of b - csa .",
    "the is due to stopping sets , which are harmful graph structures  @xcite that prevent iterative decoding . stopping sets",
    "are extensively analyzed for graph - based codes . in particular , stopping sets for a specific graph are well studied in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "csa , on the other hand , is represented by a random graph and can be seen as a code ensemble . stopping sets for code ensembles",
    "were analyzed in  @xcite , however , the obtained results are intractable for code lengths of interest and irregular codes .",
    "a similar approach to  @xcite was applied to   in  @xcite , where quite loose bounds were obtained .    in",
    "@xcite we proposed a low complexity approximation for csa at low - to - moderate channel load based on the heuristically determined `` dominant '' stopping sets , which is very accurate in the region . here , we extend the analysis in  @xcite and propose a systematic way of determining dominant stopping sets together with their probabilities .",
    "the proposed analysis is able to capture the feature of b - csa .",
    "the analytical approximation shows good agreement with the simulation results for low - to - moderate channel loads and can be used to optimize the parameters of b - csa .",
    "finally , we compare the performance of b - csa with that of , currently adopted as the mac protocol for over the .",
    "the use of the pec is justified in that it provides a simplified model of the fading channel@xcite , which allows for a tractable analysis .",
    "moreover , as we show in the paper , the all - to - all broadcast communication with half - duplex operation can be modeled as a .",
    "more accurate channel models were considered in  @xcite , however , they do not allow for a system optimization due to computational complexity .",
    "our analysis shows that significantly outperforms for channel loads of interest and that it is more robust to channel erasures due to the inherent time diversity .",
    "the contributions are summarized in the following .",
    "( a ) all - to - all broadcast is proposed ; ( b ) the analysis of csa over the in  @xcite is extended to the all - to - all broadcast scenario ; ( c ) a more accurate analysis of the performance of compared to  @xcite is presented , which includes a rigorous analysis of the probability of stopping sets and a systematic search of dominant stopping sets ; ( d ) an analytical treatment of the property for large frame lengths is presented ; ( e ) a comparison of b - csa with csma for over the pec is carried out .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath0 users , which exchange messages between each other using half - duplex transceivers .",
    "we assume that time is divided into frames , users are frame synchronized , and each user transmits one packet per frame .",
    "frames are divided into @xmath1 slots , each slot matching the packet length .",
    "the transmission phase of the protocol is identical to that of unicast  @xcite , and is briefly described in the following .",
    "every user draws a random number @xmath2 based on a predefined probability distribution , maps its message to a phy packet , and then repeats it @xmath2 times in randomly and uniformly selected slots within one frame , as shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model](a ) .",
    "such a user is called a degree-@xmath2 user .",
    "every packet contains pointers to its copies , so that , once a packet is successfully decoded , full information about the location of the copies is available .",
    "the main difference of the proposed protocol compared to unicast is that every user is also a receiver .",
    "whenever a user does not transmit , it buffers the received signal . without loss of generality , we focus on the performance of a single user , denoted by @xmath3 , also referred to as the receiver .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the set of the other @xmath5 users , termed _",
    "neighbors _ of user @xmath3 .",
    "since the frames are independent , it is sufficient to analyze the system within one frame . the received signal buffered by user @xmath3 in slot @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a packet of the @xmath9-th user in @xmath4 , @xmath10 is the channel coefficient between user @xmath9 and the receiver , and @xmath11 is the set of user @xmath3 s neighbors that transmit in the @xmath6-th slot .",
    "the @xmath6-th slot is called a _ singleton _",
    "slot if it contains only one packet .",
    "if it contains packets from more that one user , we say that a collision occurs in the @xmath6-th slot .",
    "decoding proceeds as follows .",
    "first , user @xmath3 decodes the packets in singleton slots and obtains the location of their copies .",
    "we assume decoding is possible if the corresponding channel coefficient satisfies @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a threshold that depends on the physical layer implementation .",
    "if @xmath14 , we assume that the packet is erased , i.e. , it can not be decoded and does not cause any interference .",
    "the channel coefficients are assumed to be independent across users and slots and identically distributed such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 is the probability of a packet erasure .",
    "we refer to such a channel as a .",
    "using data - aided methods  @xcite , the channel coefficients corresponding to the copies are then estimated .",
    "after subtracting the interference caused by the identified copies , decoding proceeds until no further singleton slots are found .",
    "we assume perfect interference cancellation , which is justified by physical layer simulation results in  @xcite .",
    "we remark that decoding is always performed in singleton slots , such that the code rates of different users do not have to satisfy the rate constraint for joint decoding  @xcite .",
    "the system can be represented by a bipartite graph and can be analyzed using the theory of codes on graphs  @xcite . in the graph",
    ", each user corresponds to a and represents a repetition code , whereas slots correspond to and can be seen as single parity - check codes . in the following ,",
    "the terms `` users '' and `` '' are used interchangeably .",
    "a bipartite graph is defined by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 represent the sets of , , and edges connecting them , respectively .",
    "the number of edges connected to a node is called the node degree .",
    "an important parameter in the graph is the vn degree distribution  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the probability of a vn to have a degree @xmath2 ( i.e. , the probability that the user transmits @xmath2 copies of its packet ) and @xmath24 is the maximum degree .",
    "we define a vector representation of   as @xmath25 $ ] . to avoid some technical problems in the following .",
    "this condition is always satisfied for all distributions of practical interest . ]",
    "furthermore , we define the graph profile as the vector @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the number of degree-@xmath2 in @xmath28 . the total number of vns in @xmath28 is denoted by @xmath29 and the total number of cns is denoted by @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in this paper , we focus on the broadcast , defined as the probability that a user in @xmath33 is not resolved by the receiver .",
    "since all users are independent , the plr can be calculated as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average number of users that are not successfully decoded by user @xmath3 , termed _ unresolved users_. note that the plr gives the probability that a packet of a user is not successfully received within a frame and does not refer to the copies sent by the user .",
    "we define the channel load as the ratio of contending users and the number of slots , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that , in the unicast scenario , the channel load is calculated as @xmath37 , since the receiver is not contending .",
    "for transmission over a pec , we showed in  @xcite that the performance of unicast can be accurately approximated based on an _ _ observed by the receiver .",
    "the fact that users in can not receive in the slots they use for transmission can also be modeled as packet erasures .",

    "the graph @xmath28 is what a base station in unicast would observe after the pec .",
    "however , only part of this graph is available to user  @xmath3 due to the half - duplex operation . assuming that user  @xmath3 selects degree @xmath46",
    ", we denote its available subgraph by @xmath47 and call it a _ broadcast induced graph_. @xmath47 can be obtained from @xmath28 by removing the @xmath46 cns corresponding to the slots where user @xmath3 transmits and their adjacent edges .",

    "<S> double unequal error protection ( duep ) _ phenomenon : the more a user repeats its packet , the higher the probability that this packet is decoded by other users , but the lower the probability for this user to decode packets from others . we analyze the performance of b - csa over the packet erasure channel for a finite frame length . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we provide a general analysis of stopping sets for b - csa and derive an analytical approximation of the performance in the region , which captures the duep feature of b - csa . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results reveal that the proposed approximation predicts very well the performance of b - csa in the region . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the application of b - csa to vehicular communications and compare its performance with that of carrier sense multiple access ( csma ) , the current mac protocol in vehicular networks . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that b - csa is able to support a much larger number of users than csma with the same reliability . </S>"
