    "this paper deals with soliton - like traveling wave ( tw ) solutions to some nonlinear evolutionary pdes . the tw solutions play an important role in mathematical physics .",
    "they appear in the models of various transport phenomena , including the shallow water equation @xcite , the lithosphere model @xcite , the nerve axon model @xcite , models of combustion theory @xcite , mathematical biology @xcite , and active dissipative media models @xcite ( for further examples see @xcite and references therein ) . among the great variety of nonlinear wave solutions , perhaps the most important are _ solitons _ , supported , in particular , by the celebrated korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equation . after the the discovery of integrability of the kdv equation in the second half of the xx - th century , the study of solitons attracted attention of a great many authors , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the unusual features of soliton solutions , in particular their particle - like collisions and the existence of a broad set of smooth cauchy data asymptotically turning into a finite number of solitons in the course of time evolution , have usually been attributed to the complete integrability of the kdv equation , and certain attendant properties , such as the infinite symmetry and existence of an infinite number of local conservation laws @xcite . later on it",
    "was observed that solutions to the equations which are not completely integrable manifest features similar to those demonstrated by  true",
    " solitons .",
    "a prominent example of this is provided by the so - called _ compactons _ , supported by the equations of the @xmath3 family , introduced by j. hyman and ph .",
    "rosenau in 1993 @xcite .",
    "the non - integrability of a generic member of the class of hyman ",
    "rosenau @xmath3 equations stems _",
    "inter alia _ from the fact that only a finite number of higher symmetries is known and only four local conservation laws have been obtained to date @xcite ( it was rigorously proved recently that the @xmath3 equations for @xmath4 and @xmath5 have just four conservation laws and no higher symmetries @xcite ) . the family of non - integrable evolutionary equations possessing stable localized solutions with soliton features is not exhausted by the generic @xmath3 equations . other non - integrable models with similar features of soliton - like solutions are presented in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to demonstrate the existence of stable soliton - like tw solutions in a hydrodynamic - type model taking into account the effects of spatial nonlocality .",
    "the study of higher symmetries and local conservation laws admitted by the system under study reveals its non - integrability for generic values of parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the solitary waves supported by this system restore their shapes after the mutual collisions .",
    "furthermore , a proper choice of the cauchy data leads to the creation of a chain of solitary waves moving with distinct velocities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce our basic system of pdes and study its higher symmetries and local conservation laws . using these results ,",
    "we establish non - integrability of this system for generic values of parameters . in section 3",
    "we give a geometric insight into the structure of the phase space of the dynamic system obtained through the symmetry - based reduction of the initial system , and formulate the conditions which guarantee that the reduced system possesses a one - parameter family of homoclinic solutions corresponding to the solitary wave regimes . in section 4",
    "we study the perturbed solitary wave solutions and estimate the essential spectrum of the linearized problem . in section 5",
    "we perform a numerical study of stability for the solitary waves of rarefaction ( dark solitons ) using the evans function and investigate some peculiarities of the solitary waves , such as the dependence of their maximal depth and the effective width on the wave velocity , evolution of the initial non - solitonic perturbation and the behavior of waves in the course of their collisions .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss the results obtained and give an outline of further research .",
    "it is well known that the features of tw depend in essence on dispersive and nonlinear properties of physical media @xcite .",
    "let us stress that in many cases nonlocal effects caused by internal structure of the media can also play significant role in formation and evolution of wave patterns .",
    "the presence of internal structure causes various effects such as the fragmentation of smooth initial perturbations and intensification of shock fronts in the models of heterogeneous media @xcite , soliton and compacton features of the block media models @xcite , and many others .",
    "unfortunately , there exists no universal model describing structured media in a sufficiently wide range of the values of parameters .",
    "below we introduce a model system taking into account the nonlocal effects related to the presence of internal structure ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "this model applies when the ratio of the characteristic size @xmath6 of elements of the structure to the characteristic wavelength @xmath7 of the wave pack is much smaller than unity and therefore the continual approach is still valid but the said ratio is not small enough to ignore the presence of internal structure .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite , the balance equations for mass and momentum of media with internal structure in the long - wave approximation still retain their classical form , which in the one - dimensional case reads @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the mass velocity , @xmath10 is the pressure , @xmath11 is the density , t is the time , @xmath12 is the mass ( lagrangian ) coordinate related to the conventional spatial coordinate @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath12 denote partial derivatives with respect to indicated variables .",
    "thus , the entire information about the presence of structure in this approximation is contained in a dynamical equation of state ( des ) which should be incorporated into the system ( [ eq : balanceq ] ) in order to make it closed . in general ,",
    "des for structured media manifesting the nonlocal features takes the form of an integral equation @xcite relating the generalized thermodynamical flow @xmath16 and the generalized thermodynamical force @xmath17 causing this flow : @xmath18\\,dt'.\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is the kernel of nonlocality .",
    "the function @xmath20 can be calculated by solving the dynamical problem of structure elements interaction ; however , such calculations are extremely difficult .",
    "therefore , in practice one uses , as a rule , some model kernel describing well enough the main properties of the nonlocal effects and , in particular , the fact that these effects vanish rapidly as @xmath21 and @xmath22 grow .",
    "this property could be used for passing from the integral equation ( [ eq : intgen ] ) to a purely differential equation .",
    "one of the simplest equations of state taking into account the effects of spatial nonlocality takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 $ ] is the kernel accounting for a purely spatial nonlocality .",
    "this model is attributed in @xcite to the situation when the density of a medium changes abruptly from point to point , as this is the case with an elastic body containing the microcracks or low density solid inclusions .",
    "using the fact that the function @xmath25}$ ] extremely quickly approaches zero as @xmath22 grows , one can replace the function @xmath26 by several terms of its power series expansion , @xmath27_{x}\\frac{x'-x}{1!}+ [ \\rho^{n}(t,\\,x)]_{xx}\\frac{\\left(x'-x\\right)^2}{2!}+o(|x - x'|^{3}),\\ ] ] obtaining in this way the following approximate flow - force relation : @xmath28_{xx}.\\ ] ] here @xmath29 so both of the coefficients are positive . choosing the kernel in the form @xmath30\\,\\exp\\left[-{(x - x')^2}/{l^2}\\right]\\ ] ] and following the procedure outlined above , we obtain the dynamical equation of state @xmath31_{xx}l^3\\,\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{4}+\\frac{3}{8}\\alpha \\,l^2 \\right)\\right\\}=\\ ] ] @xmath32_{xx}.\\ ] ] for @xmath33 @xmath34 remains positive while @xmath35 becomes negative .",
    "note that a well - established linear strain - stress dependence corresponding to the above situation is presented in @xcite .",
    "nonlinear strain - stress relationship of this type can be used for the description of wave movements in the pre - stressed structured medium @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider the model system @xmath36=0 , \\\\\\\\ \\rho_{t}+\\rho^{2}u_{x}=0,\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "let us turn to the study of integrability properties of ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) .",
    "we shall use the integrability test based on existence of higher symmetries , see e.g. @xcite for details , because it allows to detect both integrability via the inverse scatttering transform and linearizability through a suitably chosen transformation and , unlike , say , the search for a lax representation , verifying the existence of higher symmetries is an algorithmic procedure .",
    "first of all , note that for @xmath39 the change of variables @xmath40 , @xmath41 linearizes this system into @xmath42 so for @xmath39 the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) is integrable ( more precisely , in this case it is @xmath43-integrable , i.e. , linearizable ) .",
    "now turn to the case @xmath44 and perform the following change of variables : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "it converts our system into the following @xmath48    the matrix at the second derivatives in ( [ vladimirov : mainspat2 ] ) has the form @xmath49 with two distinct eigenvalues @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .    then a necessary condition for ( [ vladimirov : mainspat2 ] ) to admit local higher , also known as generalized @xcite , symmetries ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein for details ) of order",
    "greater than two is ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that the quantity @xmath52 is a ( local ) conserved density for ( [ vladimirov : mainspat2 ] ) , i.e. , there exists a @xmath53 depending on @xmath54 and a finite number of @xmath12-derivatives of @xmath55 and @xmath56 such that @xmath57 by virtue of ( [ vladimirov : mainspat2 ] ) .",
    "however , it is readily checked that @xmath52 is a conserved density for ( [ vladimirov : mainspat2 ] ) only if @xmath39 or @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath59 the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat2 ] ) has local higher symmetries of order at most two .",
    "these are easily seen to have been exhausted by the lie point symmetries ( more precisely , by symmetries equivalent to the lie point ones ) .",
    "going back to ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) and making use of the transformation properties of higher symmetries , see e.g. @xcite , we conclude that ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) has no symmetries of order greater than three .",
    "the computation of symmetries of order not greater than three shows that for @xmath59 the only local higher symmetries of ( [ vladimirov : mainspat2 ] ) are ( equivalent to ) the lie point ones : @xmath60 thus , for @xmath59 the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) is _ non - integrable _ , at least in the sense of absence of genuinely higher symmetries , which is a strong indicator of non - integrability in any other sense as well , cf .",
    "the lie point symmetries ( [ symm ] ) have a clear physical interpretation : the first three are translations w.r.t .",
    "independent variables and the dependent variable @xmath9 while the last one is the scaling symmetry .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , this scaling symmetry does not involve @xmath12 .    for the generic values of parameters these are the only ( be it lie point or higher ) symmetries admitted by the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) .",
    "however , for special values of parameters additional symmetries may emerge .    for instance ,",
    "if we concentrate on the physically relevant case of @xmath61 , we easily find that for @xmath58 there appears an additional nonlocal symmetry .",
    "namely , consider the extended ( also known as potential , see e.g. @xcite for details ) system which consists of ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) and the equations for the potential @xmath62 of the conservation law given by the second equation of ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) , that is , @xmath63 the said extended system for @xmath58 possesses the following additional symmetry : @xmath64 in spite of the presence of this additional nonlocal symmetry it is rather unlikely that the case of @xmath58 is integrable but the definitive settling of this issue requires further research",
    ".    recall now that a _ local conservation law _ for the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) is a relation of the form @xmath65 vanishing modulo ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) and its differential consequences , where @xmath66 depend on @xmath67 and a finite number of @xmath12-derivatives of @xmath9 and @xmath11 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the total derivative w.r.t .  the temporal and spatial variables , respectively , cf .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the local conservation laws associated with ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) read as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and no further conserved quantities with local densities for the generic values of parameters in ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) seem to exist .",
    "we intend to address this issue in more detail in the future work .",
    "note that if @xmath72 , then some of the above @xmath73 and @xmath74 become complex , and it is convenient to use a slightly different basis of conservation laws instead of ( [ dens1 ] ) , namely @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "it is immediate that for @xmath72 the conservation laws with the densities and fluxes ( [ dens1a ] ) are real functions .",
    "we are going to analyze a set of traveling wave ( tw ) solutions having the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the velocity of tw . inserting the ansatz ( [ vladimirov : twsol ] ) into the second equation of the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) we immediately get the quadrature @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the integration constant . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "such a choice leads to the following asymptotic behavior:@xmath83    inserting the ansatz ( [ vladimirov : twsol ] ) into the first equation of the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) , and using the equation ( [ vladimirov : firstint ] ) , we obtain , after one integration , the following ode : @xmath84^{2}\\right]=e,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is a constant of integration , defined by the conditions on @xmath86 .",

    "they are determined by solutions of the algebraic equation @xmath89 as can be easily seen , one of the roots of equation ( [ vladimirov : cp_spat ] ) coincides with @xmath90 .",
    "location of the second real positive root , @xmath91 , depends on relations between the parameters .",
    "it is placed to the right from @xmath92 if @xmath93 satisfies inequality @xmath94 and to the left of it if the @xmath95 .",
    "it can also be shown that for @xmath96 being natural number or zero the polynomial @xmath97 has the representation @xmath98 where @xmath99 note that @xmath100 is positive , when @xmath101 .",
    "analysis of system s ( [ vladimirov : ds1 ] ) linearization matrix @xmath102 , \\qquad i=1,2 , \\qquad j\\ne i\\ ] ] shows , that the stationary points @xmath103 is a saddle , while the point @xmath104 is a center if either @xmath105 and @xmath106 , or @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "in both of these cases the system ( [ vladimirov : ds1 ] ) has only such stationary points , which are characteristic to the hamiltonian systems .",
    "it suggests that , by a proper choice of the integrating factor , ( [ vladimirov : ds1 ] ) can be rewritten in the hamiltonian form .",
    "in fact , introducing the new independent variable @xmath109 we get : @xmath110 with @xmath111    the existence of the hamiltonian function implies that the stationary point @xmath112 keeps to be surrounded by the one - parameter family of periodic trajectories after the nonlinear terms are added .",
    "now we are interested on whether or not this set is bounded or unbounded . in the first case",
    "its natural limit is a homoclinic trajectory bi - asymptotic to the saddle @xmath113 .",
    "the homoclinic trajectory , in turn , corresponds to the solitary wave solution of the source system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) .    to answer the above question",
    ", we analyze the hamiltonian function ( [ vladimirov : hfun1 ] ) which remains constant on the trajectories of the dynamical system .",

    "the function @xmath126 is a growing function when @xmath127 is small , but since the coefficient of the highest power of @xmath128 in the function @xmath121 is negative , then for greater @xmath128 it becomes a decreasing function , intersecting the horizontal axis @xmath88 at least once .",
    "the coordinate of the first intersection is denoted as @xmath129 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath130 , and @xmath131 furthermore , the function @xmath132 is positive when @xmath133 and negative when @xmath134 .",
    "let us consider the expression @xmath135 if @xmath136 , then this expression tends to @xmath137 as @xmath138 , otherwise it tends to @xmath86 .",
    "but the last option is impossible since it contradicts the assertion that @xmath129 is the point of the first intersection of @xmath121 with the horizontal axis .",
    "form this we conclude that @xmath139 and the curves @xmath140 form a homoclinic loop .",
    "now let us assume that the conditions ( [ sless ] ) take place .",
    "obviously we are interested in the behavior of the left upper branch of the separatrice @xmath141 in this case . as it follows from ( [ eq : forq ] ) , @xmath142 thus @xmath121 , which initially grows with the growth of @xmath143 , should intersect the horizontal axis in some point @xmath144 such that @xmath145 the analysis of the formula ( [ ypr ] ) suggests that if @xmath146 then @xmath147 tends to @xmath86 as @xmath128 tends to @xmath148 and to @xmath137 if @xmath149 .",

    "the result obtained can be formulated in the following :    let us assume that @xmath151 is a natural number or zero .",

    "below we give the typical phase portraits of the system ( [ vladimirov : ds1 ] ) .",
    "to be specific , the plots were made for @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",

    "it occurs to be possible to choose parameters of  free  solitary waves in such a way that , being shifted on a proper distance , they coincide with the solitary waves of rarefaction formed in numerical solutions of the above cauchy s problem , fig .",

    "in the present paper we have performed an analysis of a hydrodynamic - type system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) . in general position",
    "the system happens to admit only four symmetry generators and seven local conservation laws .",
    "the results of the symmetry analysis , as well as the study of soliton dynamics suggest that the complete integrability of the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) is highly unlikely , at least for the generic values of parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the system is shown to possess a one - parameter family of stable solitary wave solutions manifesting some features of `` true '' solitons .",
    "let us stress that existence of a one - parameter family of solitary wave solutions is connected with the employment of the dynamic equation of state ( [ eq : tspat ] ) , taking account of the effects of pure spatial non - locality .",
    "the presence of one - parametric families of localized tw solutions is rather not inherent to another known hydrodynamic - type non - local models @xcite , accounting for temporal @xcite or spatio - temporal @xcite non - localities .",
    "note that throughout the text we do not use the analytical description of the solitary wave solutions .",
    "their existence is proved on the basis of the qualitative study of the associated dynamical system .",
    "such study is more relevant and informative than the attempts to find an analytic description for solitary waves , for they are rarely expressed in terms of elementary ( or even special ) functions .",
    "moreover , applying the qualitative methods enables one to cover the whole set of invariant solutions belonging to the given family .    the main goal of this work is the study of spectral stability for solitary waves and the dynamical features thereof .",
    "a stable evolution of the solitary waves of compression corresponding to the case of @xmath105 is virtually impossible because the intersection of @xmath53 with @xmath211 is nonempty .    in the case of",
    "@xmath107 the spectrum of linearized problem happens to lie in the set @xmath325 .",
    "this conclusion is made on the basis of the analytic investigation of the continuous spectrum and numerical study of the evans function performed for the selected values of parameters and covering a sufficiently large domain of the half - plane @xmath211 .",
    "these results are further backed by the estimate of the evans function made for large @xmath232 lying in the positive half - space .",
    "a remarkable and somewhat unexpected result obtained in the numerical experiments is the elastic dynamics of interaction of solitary wave solutions .",
    "let us stress that a mere possibility to perform such experiments is rare , for the soliton - like tw solutions supported by non - integrable evolutionary equations occur , as a rule , for specific values of parameters , including the magnitude and direction of the velocity .",
    "the numerical studies reveal some peculiarities of the solitary waves of rarefaction , in particular , an anomalous dependence of the depth and the effective width upon the wave pack velocity .",
    "these features are well understood on the basis of qualitative analysis .",
    "the decrease of the depth of the solitary wave with the increase of the velocity is related to the properties of solutions to the algebraic equation ( [ vladimirov : cp_spat ] ) determining the horizontal coordinate of the stationary point @xmath112 .",
    "thus , when the velocity @xmath78 obeying the inequalities ( [ gammin ] ) increases , the point @xmath91 in which the straight line @xmath326 intersects the curve @xmath327 moves towards @xmath92 .",
    "hence , the maximal depth of the solitary wave , which is proportional to @xmath328 , decreases .",
    "the simultaneous increase of the effective width of the solitary wave is related to the fact that all the points of the corresponding homoclinic trajectory lie in a vicinity of the stationary points , hence the phase velocity is small in every point of the homoclinic loop and tends to zero as @xmath78 approaches @xmath329 from below .    when @xmath78 approaches @xmath330 from above , a different effect is observed .",
    "since the homoclinic loop is locked from the left by the vertical axis , it attains the shape of an equilateral triangle , symmetric w.r.t . the horizontal axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ris1 ]  b ) .",
    "its base approaches the vertical axis , as the parameter @xmath78 decreases , thus resulting in an unlimited growth of the phase velocity in the region corresponding to the bottom of the solitary wave of rarefaction .",
    "this , in turn , causes the creation of an abruptly narrowing solitary wave .",
    "in fact , the solitary wave solution turns into a spike as @xmath78 approaches the left critical value , which is clearly seen in numerical experiments .    as a final remark ,",
    "note that , in addition to obtaining the rigorous results concerning the spectral stability of the tw solution , the list of open problems for the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) includes the issue of more general stability and attractive features @xcite , the study of interaction of the waves for the wide range of values of parameters , and special treatment of the distinguished special case @xmath58 , for which the system ( [ vladimirov : mainspat ] ) possesses a nonlocal symmetry .",
    "following a common practice @xcite , we shall calculate the evans function for a system of odes with constant coefficients approximating the linearized system ( [ dyn_syst ] ) .",
    "let us employ a trigonometric representation @xmath331 for @xmath7 , assuming that @xmath332 , and @xmath333 . applying the scaling transformation @xmath334 and passing to the new independent variable @xmath335",
    ", we obtain for @xmath332 an approximate system @xmath336 where @xmath337    the matrix @xmath338 has four distinct eigenvalues @xmath339 where @xmath340 , @xmath341 thus , in the generic case two eigenvectors belong to the unstable invariant manifold , and two other to the stable one .",
    "so the evans function for the asymptotic problem is proportional to @xmath342.\\ ] ] upon performing straightforward but tedious calculations we finally obtain that @xmath343 further analysis shows that under the above restrictions this number never vanishes , which indicates that the evans function is nonzero for large @xmath7 with positive real part .",
    "consider the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath239 corresponding to the small values of @xmath7 . the characteristic equation @xmath344=0 $ ] can be written as follows : @xmath345 where @xmath346 , @xmath347 , @xmath348 . in order to analyze the behavior of the eigenvalues for small @xmath349 , we represent the solutions of ( [ char ] ) in the form of series @xmath350 in the zero - order approximation we obtain the equation @xmath351 this equation has a solution @xmath352 of multiplicity 2 , and a pair of nonzero solutions @xmath353 . for @xmath354 or @xmath355 the quantities @xmath356 are real and have different signs . for @xmath357 or @xmath358 , they are purely imaginary .",
    "the asymptotic series corresponding to nonzero @xmath356 has the form : @xmath359 for @xmath356 the expansion is different : @xmath360 where @xmath361 , @xmath362 .    when @xmath363 and @xmath364 , then the real roots are shifted to the right , while the zero roots give rise to a pair of real roots having different signs .",
    "hence , the system ( [ dyn_syst ] ) has a two - dimensional unstable invariant manifold .",
    "when @xmath365 a pair of positive roots is created from zero ones , while the pair of a pure imaginary roots gain negative real part .",
