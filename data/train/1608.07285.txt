    "since the turn of the century , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with its thousands of deg@xmath17 of sky coverage , has demonstrated the utility of modern ccd - based large - scale imaging campaigns . as a result",
    ", a new generation of wide - field imaging cameras has enabled relatively small research groups to conduct intermediate - scale surveys capable of deeply imaging areas of sky ranging from dozens to 100s of deg@xmath17 that were previously accessible to much larger consortia of researchers .",
    "these imagers are particularly useful to conduct deep studies of nearby galaxy groups and clusters , which are rapidly revealing the never before accessible faint properties of these systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    among the most well - known such structures in the nearby universe is the centaurus a group , which is dominated by the giant galaxy ngc5128  at a distance of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the group is mostly comprised of at least 40 known dwarf galaxies @xcite , which with the new wide - field cameras coming online has been recently attracting a new wave of attention .",
    "one recent example is the pisces survey @xcite , which images @xmath19 around ngc5128  in the optical @xmath20- and @xmath21-bands using the optical megacam imager at the 6.5-m magellan ii clay telescope @xcite .",
    "this survey has recently revealed nine new low - surface brightness ( @xmath22 ) dwarf galaxies within @xmath23kpc of ngc5128 .",
    "a yet more ambitious program uses the _ dark energy camera _ ( decam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to cover @xmath24 encompassing ngc5128 , and the nearby m83 complex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mjb15/16 ) .",
    "this project has potentially more than doubled the known population of dwarf galaxies around the two giants , identifying at least 57 new candidates as faint as @xmath25 .",
    "while these candidates await confirmation via spectroscopy and/or resolved stellar population studies , the utility of wide - field imagers like decam in revealing the secrets of these iconic neighbours is clear .    in this contribution",
    "we present a new imaging campaign of @xmath26 centred on ngc5128  using decam at the 4-m baade telescope at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) in chile .",
    "our program , _ the survey of centaurus a s baryonic structures _ ( scabs ) is complementary to the other two recent large - scale projects . among the most powerful features of the pisces campaign",
    "is the ability to conduct resolved stellar population studies , combined with depth that samples the red giant branch at the distance of ngc5128 . on the other hand , while the mjb15/16 program reaches similar depths as pisces , they do not benefit from their resolution capabilities , but probe an area @xmath27 greater . noting the strengths and shortcomings of these two surveys , scabs addresses complementary science goals by homogeneously imaging ngc5128  to @xmath28 the galactocentric radius ( out to @xmath29 ) compared to pisces , which has so - far been focussed mainly on the ne quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "more importantly , while we only sample a fraction of the area covered by mjb15/16 , we do so in the five optical @xmath12 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 filters , providing significant spectral energy distribution ( sed ) leverage and opening the door to a suite of ancillary science goals not possible with @xmath20- and @xmath21-band imaging alone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . ",
    "[ sec : obs ] gives an overview of the scabs observations , including a brief description of decam s capabilities .",
    " [ sec : reduction ] focusses on the data reduction , image processing , and photometric measurements carried out on the inner @xmath1 region of scabs upon which this work is based .",
    "we also describe artificial star experiments which were used to asses the photometric quality and depth of our observations . ",
    "[ sec : disc ] describes the public release of our five - band source catalogues , and presents several science cases and applications for the scabs data . throughout this work",
    "we adopt a distance modulus for ngc5128  of @xmath30 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14-band scabs data were taken during the nights of 2014 april 45 ( cntacid : 2014a-0610 ; pi : matthew taylor ) , and 2014 august 2527 ( cntacid : 2014b-0609 ; pi : roberto muoz ) using decam mounted at the prime focus on the 4 m victor blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .",
    "decam is a wide field imager equipped with the optical _ u , g , r , i , z _ and y filters .",
    "working at a focal ratio of @xmath31 , it is comprised by 62 2048@xmath324096pixel , two - amplifier imaging ccds , each separated by 201 and 153pix ( @xmath3353 and 40@xmath34 ) gaps along the long and short edges respectively , giving a spatial coverage of @xmath35 .",
    "one chip ( n30 ) shows poor charge transfer efficiency rendering it scientifically useless , and since 30 november 2013 chip s30 stopped working .",
    "additionally the southern half of s7 malfunctions , and thus decam is effectively comprised of 59.5 ccds with a total of @xmath36mpix at pixel scales between 0.2626@xmath34/pix at the edge of the field - of - view , to 0.2637@xmath34/pix at the centre .",
    "luckily , the positions of the bad chips make it easy to recover the full spatial extent of decam in image mosaics that employ an appropriate dithering pattern . for more details on the decam technical specifications we refer the reader to the online documentation .",
    "scabs uses the large field - of - view of decam to image ngc5128  out to its approximate virial radius of @xmath37 , shown in fig.[fig : dither ] as the red - dashed ellipse .",
    "a five - point dithering strategy per pointing covers the decam chip gaps , and results in the flower - like mosaic of decam footprints shown by the blue shading in fig.[fig : dither ] . to account for the missing n30 and s30 chips , each pointing overlaps the northern- and southern - most ccd rows , and",
    "is shifted either e or w by a single chip width , which gives rise to the slightly denser zig - zag regions shown by the darker n  s blue bands on fig.[fig : dither ] .",
    "the first night of the 2014a-0610 program focussed on the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath12 filters , split into @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 exposures , respectively .",
    "the second night was used to finish the @xmath12-band exposures ( tiles1323 ; see fig.[fig : dither ] ) and to conduct the short @xmath41 and @xmath38 @xmath21- and @xmath20-band scabs imaging .",
    "these exposure times were selected in order to reach targeted apparent point - source magnitudes of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , corresponding to @xmath47 past the gclf turnover magnitude , assuming a dispersion of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "thus , at these depths up to 99% of gcs should be detectable in all filters ; however , a detailed assessment of the scabs image quality and limiting magnitudes is deferred to ",
    "[ sec : comptest ] .    due to intermittent thin clouds combined with a telescope malfunction ,",
    "nearly the whole of the latter half of the second night of the 2014a-0610 program was lost . for this reason ,",
    "the @xmath20- and @xmath21-band observations , as well as a single dither position of the @xmath12-band for tiles 1323 were not conducted until the 2014b-0609 run .",
    "these data are still undergoing reduction before combination with the previous data can be made and thus are not considered further here .",
    "table  [ tbl : obs ] gives a summary of the data collected , reduced , and analyzed in this work .",
    "the observing conditions varied over the course of the two nights with light cirrus giving way to clear and stable conditions during the first night , with a similar trend during the first half of the second followed by deteriorating conditions in the latter half . seeing as reported by the ctio dimm averaged @xmath49 with a dispersion of @xmath50 during the first night , while the second night had poorer conditions with mean dimm seeing of @xmath51 .",
    "the first half of the second night was also less stable , with a dispersion of @xmath52 , largely due to a short - term spike in the seeing that particularly affected the photometric calibration of the @xmath21-band images ( see  [ sec : photcalib ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the value of these data covers myriad potential lines of investigation . for example , the 90 percent completeness depths of these data are sufficient to detect @xmath53 percent of globular clusters ( gcs ) in the region , assuming a gc luminosity function peak at @xmath54mag ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and dispersion of @xmath55mag @xcite . reaching out to @xmath56kpc from ngc5128 ,",
    "the suite of colour indices are sufficient to distinguish most gcs from both foreground stellar sources , and point - like background sources that morphologically masquerade as gcs .",
    "moreover , the extent of scabs reaches into the extreme halo of ngc5128  and thus should begin to probe gcs associated with the intra - group medium of centaurus a , including any dwarfs in the region .",
    "altogether , the potential for these data to identify the vast majority of gcs associated with ngc5128  represents a powerful method of constraining its mass assembly history through cosmic time .",
    "the serendipitous location of ngc5128  at relatively low galactic latitude ( @xmath57 ) makes this dataset valuable for more than strictly extragalactic investigation .",
    "the wide - field coverage of decam , with pointings mildly off of the galactic plane makes the removal of foreground stars challenging for background science , but the sampling of the full optical sed eases this task and thus can provide a rich list of foreground star photometry .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 of coverage samples foreground stars through the thin and thick galactic disks , and out into the halo toward ngc5128 , potentially providing a rich catalogue of foreground stars with ten permutations of optical colour indices . by comparison to state - of - the - art stellar atmospheric models , rich ancillary science including studies of the ages and metallicities of the various populations of galactic foreground stars are possible .",
    "the doubling of the local group dwarf galaxy population in the past decade ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , little is known about dwarf galaxy populations beyond the local group . to this end",
    ", rich populations of dwarf galaxies are being discovered in nearby galaxy clusters like virgo and fornax @xcite and ngc5128  itself @xcite which provide direct observational tests of the bottom - up hierarchical formation of their hosts as favoured by @xmath58cold dark matter cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations , in conjunction with the identification of the group s extended gc system , will then be of excellent utility in placing new constraints on the assembly history of this iconic galaxy and its group environment , which is the natural extension of the ongoing detailed local volume studies , such as sdss , panstarrs , pandas , and the _ dark energy survey _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while the depth is not sufficient to probe the high - redshift ( @xmath59 ) universe , the optical luminosity function ( lf ) of intermediate redshift galaxies is sensitive to the star formation / morphological properties of the underlying galaxy population",
    "meanwhile , similarly deep near - infrared ( nir ) observations have already been conducted and will extend the sed coverage yet further . together with the optical data discussed here these data will probe the mass function ( mf ) of background cluster galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the evolution of the mf is directly predicted from hierarchical galaxy formation models that incorporate theoretical seds ( e.g.  galform * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the full nuv - nir lfs represent an excellent test for model predictions such as these .",
    "altogether the depth of the scabs data provide an excellent opportunity to derive galaxy parameters for a rich sample of galaxies out to @xmath60 .",
    "this paper presents new optical ( @xmath0 ) observations of the central @xmath1 ( @xmath61 ) region of the centaurus a galaxy group centred on ngc5182 , as part of the _ survey of centaurus a s baryonic structures ( scabs)_. the observations have a raw data reduction conducted by the _ ctio - decam community pipeline _",

    "artificial star experiments are conducted to derive 50 and 90 percent point - source completeness estimates , finding 90 percent completeness magnitudes of at least @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11ab mag in the @xmath12- , @xmath20- , @xmath21- , @xmath13- , and @xmath14-bands , respectively , with very stable photometric sensitivity across the field .",
    "we release our source catalogues for public use , which can be used to , as non - exhaustive examples , probe the compact stellar systems ( ucds and gcs ) of the centaurus a galaxy group in the context of their stellar population parameters and ngc5128 s mass assembly history , study the background universe out to @xmath62 , and probe the properties of the distinct populations of galactic foreground stars in the direction of ngc5128 .",
    "we look forward to releasing future source catalogues including the central @xmath63 around centaurus a , as well as finishing a detailed background subtraction that will yield multi - band photometry of ngc5128 s rich dwarf galaxy population , both old and new .",
