    "for instance , @xcite considered the effects of turbulence on microscopic resistivity , @xcite proposed that the current diffusivity should be modified to include the diffusion of electrons across the large scale magnetic field due to the small scale field line stochasticity .",
    "the consequent modifications to the ohmic resistivity have only a marginal effect on the sweet - parker reconnection speeds .",
    "@xcite studied 2d magnetic reconnection in the presence of external turbulence both theoretically and numerically .",
    "they pointed out various turbulence mechanisms that would enhance reconnection rates , including multiple x - points as reconnection sites .",
    "however , this work did not include the effect of magnetic field wandering , which is at the core of the lv99 .",

    "[ fig : lv99model],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we begin by offering a brief summary of the differences between the sweet - parker model of the laminar reconnection @xcite and the lazarian - vishniac model which accounts for the effects of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the latter can be seen as a generalization of the sweet - parker model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lv99model ] ) in the sense that the two regions of differing magnetic directions are pressed up against one another over a broad contact region .",
    "this is a generic configuration , which should arise naturally whenever a magnetic field has a non - trivial configuration , whose energy could be lowered through reconnection",
    ". the outflow of plasma and reconnected flux will fluctuate as the turbulence evolves and the field line connections change , but the long term average will reflect the turbulent diffusion of the field lines . consequently , the essential difference between the sweet - parker model and the lv99 model is that the former the outflow is limited by microphysical ohmic diffusivity , while in the lv99 model the large - scale magnetic field wandering determines the thickness of outflow . for extremely weak turbulence , when the range of magnetic field wandering becomes smaller than the width of the sweet - parker layer @xmath14 , the two models are indistinguishable . by weak turbulence ,",
    "following lv99 , we understand a regime where the correlation length is much greater than the distance by which individual field lines deviate from a straight line .",
    "lv99 considered a large scale , well - ordered magnetic field , of the kind that is normally used as a starting point for discussions of reconnection . in the presence of turbulence",
    "the field has some small scale ` wandering ' .",
    "lv99 suggested that the presence of a random magnetic field component leads to fast reconnection .",
    "there are three phenomena mainly responsible for this :    * only a small fraction of any magnetic field line is subject to direct ohmic annihilation , therefore the fraction of magnetic energy that goes directly into heating the fluid drops down to zero as the fluid resistivity vanishes , * the presence of turbulence enables many magnetic field lines to enter the reconnection zone simultaneously , * turbulence broadens the width of the ejection thickness allowing for more efficient removal of the reconnected flux .    with the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth gs95 ) model of turbulence , lv99 obtained : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy injection scale and velocity .",
    "this expression assumes that energy is injected isotropically at the scale @xmath16 smaller than the length of current sheet @xmath10 , which for subalfvnic turbulence leads to the generation of weakly interacting waves at that scale .",
    "the waves transfer energy to modes with larger values of @xmath18 until strong turbulence sets in .",
    "it is important to note that the strongly turbulent eddies have a characteristic velocity of @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "the reconnection speed is the large eddy strong turbulent velocity times factors which depend on whether the current sheet is smaller or larger than the large eddies ( whose length is approximately the injection scale ) . in this sense",
    "the reconnection speed should be fairly insensitive to the exact mechanism for turbulent power injection .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is test whether or not this is true for a simple modification of the driving mechanism used in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note three features of equation  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "first , and most important , it is independent of resistivity .",
    "this is , by definition , fast reconnection .",
    "second , we usually expect reconnection to be close to the turbulent eddy speed , the geometric ratios that enter the expression , i.e. the injection scale @xmath16 divided by the length of the reconnection layer @xmath10 , are typically of order unity .",
    "reconnection will occur on dynamical time scales .",
    "finally , we note that in particular situations when turbulence is extremely weak the reconnection speed can be much slower than the alfvn speed .",
    "more recently , equation  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) was derived using the ideas based on the well - known concept of richardson diffusion @xcite . from the theoretical perspective",
    "this new derivation avoids rather complex considerations of the cascade of reconnection events that were presented in lv99 to justify the model .",
    "@xcite also shows that lv99 model is closely connected to the recently developed idea of `` spontaneous stochasticity '' of magnetic fields in turbulent fluids .    in general",
    ", the situation in reconnection community now is very different from that a decade ago .",
    "currently , possibilities of fast reconnection in mhd regime due to instabilities of the reconnection layers are widely discussed @xcite .",
    "these ideas can be traced back to the work of @xcite .",
    "the instabilities , like tearing instability , open up the reconnection layer enabling a wide outflow .",
    "we expect such an outflow to become turbulent for most of astrophysical conditions . in this case , the process can be important for initiating reconnection in the particular situation when the level of preexisting turbulence is initially low to initiate sufficiently fast reconnection .",
    "we feel that exploring the ways of initiation of turbulent reconnection is very synergistic to the lv99 ideas , but in the current paper we focus on the case of preexisting turbulence of sufficient level .",
    "this is the primary domain for which lv99 provides predictions .",
    "given the limited dynamical range of numerical simulations , we can only inject power on scales less than than @xmath10 .",
    "the most convenient numerical parameter is not @xmath17 , but the energy injection power @xmath20 .",
    "the power in the turbulent cascade is @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "the amount of energy injected during one alfvn time unit @xmath23 , which is constant in our models , is @xmath24 .",
    "therefore @xmath25 . substituting @xmath26 in equation  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) results in @xmath27 which is the prediction we will test here . in what follows",
    "we refer to the injection power and scale using @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we use a high - order shock - capturing godunov - type scheme based on the monotonicity preserving ( mp ) spatial reconstruction ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we used a multi - state harten - lax - van leer ( hlld , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) approximate riemann solver for solving the isothermal mhd equations .",
    "the hlld riemann solver takes into account magnetic fields , and can follow alfvn waves with minimal numerical dissipation .",
    "this is particularly important here , because our simulations are in the quasi - incompressible regime , where most of energy is transported by alfvn waves .",
    "the @xmath38 is maintained by solving the induction equation ( eq .  [ eq : induction ] ) using the field interpolated constrained transport ( ct ) scheme based on a staggered mesh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "our reconnection simulation setup is illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup_planes ] , which is a 2d cut through the problem setup , indicating the location of the diffusion region .",
    "the top and bottom of the computational domain contain equal and opposite field components in the @xmath39 direction , as well as a shared component @xmath40 ( see the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : setup_planes ] ) .",
    "magnetic field lines enter through the top and bottom and are bent by the inflow @xmath41 as they move into the diffusion region .",
    "the diffusion region has a length @xmath42 in the @xmath39 direction and a thickness @xmath43 in the @xmath44 direction ( see the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : setup_planes ] ) .",
    "the box is periodic in the @xmath45 direction and the diffusion region extends through the entire domain .",
    "the projection of the magnetic topology on the xz plane shows that the lines in the upper region ( solid lines in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_planes ] ) and in the lower region ( dashed lines ) create an angle @xmath46 determined by the strength of the shared component @xmath47 .",
    "once the incoming magnetic lines enter the diffusion region , they are reconnected and the product of this process is ejected along x direction with a speed @xmath48 ( the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_planes ] ) .",
    "we begin with a harris current sheet of the form @xmath49 initialized using the magnetic vector potential @xmath50,and a uniform guide field @xmath51 .",
    "the initial setup is completed by setting the density profile from the condition of the uniform total ( thermal plus magnetic ) pressure @xmath52 and setting the initial velocity to zero .    magnetic reconnection is initiated by a small perturbation of the vector potential @xmath53 to the initial configuration of @xmath54 whose strength is given by the coefficient @xmath55 .",
    "in all our simulations the strength of the magnetic field is expressed in terms of the alfvn velocity defined by the antiparallel component of the unperturbed magnetic field .",
    "similarly the density is expressed in terms of the unperturbed density @xmath56 and velocities are expressed as fractions of the fiducial alfvn speed .",
    "the length of the box in the @xmath39 direction defines the unit of distance and time is measured in units of @xmath57 . in the new set of models we set the initial strength of the antiparallel magnetic field component @xmath58 and the guide field @xmath59 .",
    "we performed modeling for two resistivity coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 which are expressed in the dimensionless units .",
    "the initial perturbation is set to @xmath62 . in order to avoid the complications of strong compressibility we have set the sound speed to 4.0 .",
    "our computational box has a grid of 256x512x256 or for higher resolution runs , 512x1024x512 . in dimensionless",
    "units its size is @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we double the size in the @xmath44 direction to keep the driven turbulence away from the inflow boundary .",
    "there is no physical reason to do this , but driving turbulence near the inflow boundary produces numerical instabilities .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we use three different types of boundary conditions , depending on the direction of the boundary : outflow boundary conditions along the @xmath39 direction , inflow boundary conditions along the @xmath44 direction and ( sometimes ) periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath45 direction .",
    "the open boundary conditions are the same as those used in our previous modeling .",
    "we refer to @xcite for their detailed description .",
    "briefly , we use simple `` zero - gradient '' boundary conditions , setting the normal derivatives of the fluid variables ( density and momentum ) to zero . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    "this allows waves to leave the box without significant boundary reflections . in turbulence simulations",
    "this can lead to a slight drift in the fluid density .",
    "there is no requirement that the boundary density is constant , and inflows and outflows can cause a small net gain or loss from the system .",
    "fortunately , changes in the total mass are small and only fluctuate around the initial value @xcite .",
    "they do not influence our results significantly .    in order to incorporate the magnetic field into the open boundary conditions",
    ", we set the transverse components of the vector potential @xmath31 using first order extrapolation .",
    "the normal derivative of the normal component is set to zero . in this way the normal derivatives of the transverse components of the magnetic field are zero , while the normal component of magnetic field is calculated from the zero - divergence condition @xmath65 .",
    "this approach avoids the generation of nonzero magnetic divergence at the boundary .",
    "however , it has the drawback that it creates a small jump in the momentum flux across the boundary resulting from the presence of non - zero terms @xmath66 at the x outflow boundary and @xmath67 at the y inflow boundary .",
    "we have evaluated the velocity increment these terms produce at each time step . in models with the strongest turbulence these terms were of order of @xmath68 and @xmath69 at the x and y boundaries , respectively . in the presence of strong outflows and inflows , generally of order unity , they are clearly negligible .    simulations with explicit resistivity run into problems at the boundaries . in order to avoid a non - continuous resistive term and difficulties with the treatment of the current density @xmath70",
    "we have introduced a zone of decaying resistivity near the boundary . in a thin layer near the boundary ,",
    "the value of resistivity @xmath71 decays down to a very small value chosen to be close to the numerical resistivity @xmath72 of our code . in our models",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath73 .",
    "none of this has an effect on the reconnection speeds .",
    "the validation of this method was presented in @xcite .      in our previous work we drove turbulence using a method described by @xcite , in which the driving term was implemented in the spectral space with discrete fourier components concentrated around a wave vector @xmath74 corresponding to the injection scale @xmath75 .",
    "we perturbed a number @xmath76 of discrete fourier components of velocity in a shell extending from @xmath77 to @xmath78 with a gaussian profile of the half width @xmath79 and the peak amplitude @xmath80 at the injection scale .",
    "the amplitude of driving is solely determined by its power @xmath1 , the number of driven fourier components and the time step of driving @xmath81 .",
    "the randomness in time makes the force neutral in the sense that it does not directly correlate with any of the time scales of the turbulent flow , and it also determines the power input solely by the force - force correlation .    on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : momentum ] ) ,",
    "the forcing is represented by a function @xmath82 , where @xmath29 is local density and @xmath83 is random acceleration calculated using the method described above . in a similar way we can drive turbulence in the vector potential or magnetic field , which is represented by term @xmath37 on the right hand side of the induction equation ( eq .  [ eq : induction ] ) .    in the new method of turbulence driving we",
    "add individual eddies with random locations of their centers and random orientations , either to velocity or magnetic field , at random moments in time .",
    "this guarantees the randomness of new forcing .",
    "each eddy is calculated from a kernel function described by a directional vector @xmath84 ( with amplitude @xmath85 ) multiplied by a gaussian function @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the location of the eddy center , and @xmath43 is the eddy width .",
    "an actual eddy is generated from such a kernel function by taking its curl , i.e. @xmath88 or @xmath89 in the case of injection in velocity or magnetic field , respectively .",
    "for example , if we assume that we inject one eddy in the magnetic field at @xmath90 , and that the perturbing vector potential fluctuation has only the nonzero component , i.e. @xmath91 , the contribution to magnetic field is expressed by @xmath92 \\left ( x , y , z \\right ) = \\frac{|{\\textbf{\\em a}}|}{\\delta^2 } \\exp\\left ( - \\frac{|{\\textbf{\\em r}}|^2}{2 \\delta^2 } \\right )   \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }    - y \\\\      x \\\\      0   \\end{array }   \\right ] dt \\ .\\ ] ] this function describes an eddy injected in the xy plane with the maximum amplitude @xmath93 at the distance @xmath94 and injection scale @xmath95 .",
    "we know the energy injected by one eddy , which is latexmath:[$\\delta e_{eddy } = \\pi^{3/2 }    amplitude @xmath85 from the injection power @xmath1 and the injection rate @xmath97 , which is the number of eddies injected in a time unit , @xmath98 these estimates are done for the 3d case . in the 2d case",
    "the eddy energy is @xmath99 , and therefore the eddy amplitude can be determined from @xmath100 .    in the new method",
    "there is no direct treatment of the velocity - force correlation , therefore there is no guarantee that this correlation is zero and the injected power is completely determined by the force - force correlation .",
    "a reasonable solution to this problem would be to control the amount of injected energy and modify the amplitude of injected eddies or the injection rate at each time step in order to compensate the differences in the energy injected in the domain .",
    "the performed tests show , however , that although the velocity - force correlation is not zero , it is in fact fluctuating in time with a small amplitude , and giving in result a zero net contribution .",
    "the new method drives turbulence directly in the real space , in contrast to the previous one , therefore it can be applied locally .",
    "we drive turbulence in a subvolume of the domain .",
    "the size of the subvolume is determined by two scales , the radius @xmath101 on the xz plane around the center of the domain and the height @xmath102 describing the thickness of the driving region from the midplane . in this way",
    "we avoid driving turbulence at the boundary and reduce the influence of driving on the inflow or outflow .",
    "all models are evolved without turbulence for several dynamical times in order to allow the system to achieve stationary laminar reconnection .",
    "then , at a given time @xmath103 we start driving turbulence by increasing its amplitude to the desired level , until @xmath104 . in this way we let the system to adjust to a new state . from time",
    "@xmath104 the turbulence is driven with the full power @xmath1 .      in the next sections we measure the reconnection rate using the new method of reconnection rate measure introduced in @xcite and described by a formula @xmath105\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the strength of reconnecting magnetic component",
    ", @xmath107 is the electric field , @xmath108 is area element of an xz plane across which we perform integration , @xmath109 is the line element separating two regions of the yz plane defined by the sign of @xmath106 , @xmath110 is the asymptotic absolute value of @xmath106 , and @xmath111 is the width of the box .",
    "this method of the reconnection rate measure was derived from the magnetic flux conservation @xmath112 and takes into account all processes contributing to the change of magnetic flux .",
    "the electric field @xmath113 can be further divided into an advection term @xmath114 , a shear term @xmath115 , and a resistive term @xmath116 . with this in mind",
    "the line integral can be rewritten as @xmath117    this new reconnection measure contains the time derivative of the absolute value of @xmath106 , and a number of boundary terms , such as advection of @xmath106 across the boundary and the boundary integral of the resistive term @xmath118 .",
    "the additional terms include all processes contributing the time change of @xmath119 .",

    "when the system adjusts to a new state , both measures coincide and even though they fluctuate , they reach a stationary state characterized by faster reconnection",
    ". both types of turbulence bring the reconnection rate to similar level .",
    "somewhat higher reconnection rate in the model with new driving could be attributed to the fact that this model was calculated using the 5th order spatial reconstruction and the 3rd order integration in time , in contrast to the old model where we used the second order methods .",
    "lower order , especially in the spatial interpolation , introduces additional numerical diffusion decreasing the amplitudes of turbulent fluctuations at scales comparable to the current sheet scale .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rate ] we also show the way of measuring the reconnection rates , in the sweet - parker and lv99 stages , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively . because the reconnection rates fluctuate in the presence of turbulence we also measure their time variance @xmath139 using the standard deviation .",
    "in addition to the time variance of @xmath0 , we measure their errors by splitting the averaging region into two subregions and after averaging the rates @xmath141 and @xmath142 over each subregion ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rate ] ) , we take the absolute value of their difference @xmath143 .",
    "this difference corresponds to the error of @xmath0 , i.e. it is different from zero if the rate is not constant in time . in all further analysis and presented plots we use values estimated in this way .",
    "these measures correspond exactly to those presented in @xcite .      in this section",
    "we compare field topologies in two example models run with the same set of parameters , but with different types of driving .",
    "both models have been simulated with the uniform resistivity @xmath134 and the resolution 256x512x256 .",
    "we injected turbulence with power @xmath144 at the injection scale @xmath145 .",
    "the only difference between models is the way we injected turbulence . in the old model we inject velocity fluctuations with random phases in fourier space , and then transform them to real space and shape by a window in order to limit the injection to the specified region near the current sheet . in the new model , we inject magnetic loops with random locations and random orientations in the 3d volume near the current sheet .",
    "the way of injecting turbulence is essentially different in both cases .                 in figure",
    "[ fig : top_turb ] we show examples of xy - cuts ( upper row ) and xz - cuts ( lower row ) through the box for the model with old driving . in the left and middle columns we show topologies of the velocity and magnetic field , respectively , with the intensities corresponding to the amplitude of components parallel to the plotted plane . in the right column we show the absolute value of current density with overplotted magnetic vectors .",
    "velocity has a very complex and mixed structure near the midplane due to constant injection of fluctuations in this region ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : top_turb ] ) .",
    "the majority of the velocity fluctuations is perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "this is because we are in the nearly incompressible regime of turbulence ( large plasma @xmath146 ) and most of the fluctuations propagate as alfvn waves along the mean magnetic field .",
    "slow and fast waves , whose strengths are significantly reduced , are allowed to propagate in directions perpendicular to the mean field as well . as a result , a big fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy leaves the box along magnetic lines .",
    "we observe , however , an efficient bending of magnetic lines at the midplane where the field is weaker ( see the upper middle plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : top_turb ] ) .",
    "this is not result of a driving , but result of reconnection .",
    "in general the interface between positively and negatively directed magnetic lines is much more complex than in the case of sweet - parker reconnection .",
    "this complexity favors creation of enhanced current density regions , where the local reconnection works faster ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : top_turb ] ) .",
    "since we observe multiple reconnection events happening at the same time , the global reconnection rate should be significantly enhanced .                 in figure",
    "[ fig : top_new ] we show similar examples of xy - cuts ( upper row ) and xz - cuts ( lower row ) through the box but for a model with the new way of driving turbulence . here , a big number of individual eddies is injected in the magnetic field with random locations and random orientations in domain . comparing to plots in figure  [ fig : top_turb ]",
    "we see differences but also some clear similarities . among the similarities ,",
    "we note a highly turbulent region near the current sheet seen in all xy - cuts , with the current sheet itself strongly deformed and fragmented into many small scale current sheets ( the right column of figures  [ fig : top_turb ] and [ fig : top_new ] ) .",
    "we see also some small increase of magnetic field strength near the current sheet ( middle top panels ) resulting from working turbulence in the injection region . among the differences we can list somewhat different distributions of the fragmented current sheets in the new model with clear enhancements in the locations where the magnetic eddies are injected at that moment .",
    "these enhancements are clearly seen in the magnetic topology and current density plots ( middle and right columns ) . in order to decrease those strong disturbances of the magnetic lines",
    ", we shall reproduce the same model with higher injection rate and reduced amplitudes of individual eddies .",
    "another difference is the strength of current density @xmath70 . in the model with old",
    "driving we see more volume in which @xmath147 reaches high magnitude and its structure is elongated with the local field . in the model with new driving , the current density with high strength seems to be less correlated with the local field , probably due to the presence of newly injected eddies . in the intermediate strengths , the structure of @xmath147 seems",
    "to be better correlated with the local field .",
    "we see from this comparison that models with different driving of turbulence demonstrate different topologies of the fields . in the next sections we show , that the averaged reconnection rates do not change significantly , confirming that the way we inject turbulence is of less importance and only its strength and injection scale have influence on @xmath0 .       on @xmath1 updated by symbols from new models .",

    "this is in agreement with the lv99 prediction , that the reconnection rate does not depend on the type of turbulence .",

    "in this subsection we aim to study the injection scale dependence . for this purpose we performed several models with the new way of driving turbulence , as well , in order to verify if they confirm the dependence of the reconnection speed @xmath0 on the scale @xmath2 at which we inject turbulence .",

    "this is due to reduced numerical dissipation of velocity , since in the new models we used higher order methods .",

    "[ fig : sca_dep ] ]    figure  [ fig : sca_dep ] shows a bit weaker scaling with the injection scale than that predicted by lv99 model , i.e. @xmath158 .",
    "we see several possible sources for the discrepancy . for instance , the existence of a turbulent inverse cascade can modify the effective @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , reconnection can also modify the characteristics of turbulence , such as the power spectrum and anisotropy .",

    "we performed additional studies of the reconnection rate dependence on viscosity .",
    "the dissipation scale of turbulent cascade is related to the magnitude of viscosity .",

    "the lv99 model was introduced for both collisional and collisionless media and it claimed that the microphysics of collisionless reconnection events does not change the resulting reconnection rates .",
    "this point was subjected to further scrutiny in @xcite who provided a thorough investigation of the problem and concluded that for most of astrophysical collisionless plasmas the lv99 model should be applicable , provided that plasma is turbulent . with turbulence being ubiquitous in astrophysical conditions , this hardly constraints the applicability of the lv99 model .",
    "the lv99 model of reconnection is applicable to the collisional medium , such as the ism , which is both turbulent and magnetized , and where the hall - mhd reconnection does not work @xcite .",
    "for instance , for hall - mhd reconnection to be applicable , it is required that the sweet - parker current sheet @xmath161 width is smaller than the ion inertial length @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the `` reconnection criterion for media to be collisionless '' is @xmath163 , which presents a much severe constraint on the possible rate of collisions . as a result magnetic reconnection happens to be mediated by the hall - mhd only if the extend of the contact region @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lv99model ] ) does not exceed @xmath164  cm .",
    "magnetic fields in the ism should interact over much larger scales .",
    "the lv99 model works in astrophysical environments to which the hall - mhd reconnection is applicable , as well , like solar corona , interplanetary medium , if the level of turbulence is high enough .",
    "the reconnection on microscales can happen fast , i.e. in the hall - mhd fashion .",
    "this may not change , however , the global reconnection rate .",
    "the lv99 model shows that even with relatively slow sweet - parker reconnection at microscales the global reconnection is limited not by ohmic resistivity , but by the rate of magnetic field wondering .",
    "we believe that the hall - mhd _ local _ reconnection of magnetic fields is taking place in the interplanetary medium , which is being tested by local _ in - situ _ measurements , while the _ global _ reconnection rates are determined by magnetic field wandering as prescribed in lv99 .      in the absence of quantitative model to be tested , simulations aimed at studying reconnection speed have been done in 2d , both for collisional and collisionless regimes .",
    "this allowed to achieve higher resolutions ( compared to those contemporary available in 3d ) but substantially constrained magnetic field dynamics .",
    "for instance , the closest study to ours was done by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the authors studied 2d magnetic reconnection in the presence of external turbulence .",
    "an enhancement of the reconnection rate was reported , but the numerical setup precluded the calculation of a long term average reconnection rate .",
    "a more recent study along the approach in @xcite is one in @xcite , where the effects of small scale turbulence on 2d reconnection were studied and no significant effects of turbulence on reconnection were reported for the setup chosen by the authors .",
    "later , @xcite redone the modeling of 2d turbulent reconnection following @xcite with much higher resolutions .",
    "they used an advanced technique to detect precisely all x - points in the domain and then performed statistical studies confirming the sweet - parker relation for the reconnection rate as a function of x - point geometry .",
    "the development of different techniques to study magnetic reconnection is very important . even though their modeling was limited to one type of highly superalfvnic decaying turbulence ( the initial uniform magnetic field was zero ) , they reported reconnection rates with normalized values @xmath165 and confirmed the importance of turbulence for modifying the character of magnetic reconnection and specifies heating and transport as the effect of particular significance , as well as formation of petschek - type `` x - points '' in 2d turbulence . due to",
    "the lack of large scale magnetic field configuration , their model represents a specific case , far from generic situation observed in the astrophysical objects where the mean and turbulent components of magnetic fields have comparable strengths .",
    "therefore , these studies can not predict the global reconnection rate , as well .",
    "moreover , @xcite interpreted successful numerical confirmation of the lv99 model as a result of strong turbulence , although @xcite addressed this problem carefully showing that the amplitudes of velocity fluctuations , both injected and obtained from spectra of developed and stationary turbulence , are fractions of alfvn speed .",
    "the fact that our study is in 3d is essential , as the lv99 model is intrinsically three dimensional .",
    "the general picture is of tangled field lines with reconnection taking place via a series of `` y - points '' or modified sweet - parker sheets distributed in some fractal way throughout the turbulence .",
    "a large scale sweet - parker sheet will be replaced by a more fractured surface , but the current sheets will occupy a vanishingly small fraction of the total volume and the field reversal will remain relatively well localized .",
    "the model predicts that the reconnection speed would be approximately equal to the strong turbulent velocity with a modest dependence on the ratio of the eddy length to the current sheet length .",
    "there should be no dependence on resistivity .",
    "the major results contained in our figures showing the dependence of the reconnection speed on resistivity , input power and input scale agree with the quantitative predictions of the lv99 model .",
    "we are not aware of any competing models to compare our simulations with .    the major differences from the present study stem from the fact that we test a 3d model of reconnection , as the lv99 depends on effects , like field wandering , that happen only in 3d .",
    "in order to show how different 2d and 3d worlds are , we performed similar studies to those presented in @xcite , but limiting the domain to two dimensions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that 2d magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence depends on the ohmic resistivity , therefore , it is not fast . also , the dependencies on the turbulent power and injection scales were significantly weaker than in the lv99 .",
    "this dependence of 2d reconnection rate on ohmic resistivity in the presence of turbulence , although weaker than the sweet - parker relation @xmath166 , has been independently confirmed by @xcite studies , performed with very different approach .",
    "these differences call for deliberation with simple extension of conclusions coming from the 2d modeling to natural for magnetic field fully three dimensional world .",
    "reconnection is one of the most fundamental processes involving magnetic fields in conducting fluids or plasmas .",
    "therefore , the identification of a robust process responsible for reconnection has many astrophysically important consequences .",
    "below we list a few selected implications of the successful validation of the lv99 model .",
    "numerical studies on fermi acceleration in turbulent reconnection have a long history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the sweet - parker model",
    ", it has been shown that particles can accelerate due to the induced electric field in the reconnection zone @xcite .",
    "this @xmath167 acceleration process , however , is constrained by the narrow thickness of the acceleration zone which has to be larger than the particle larmor radius and by the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of this process is rather limited . besides",
    ", it also does not predict a power - law spectrum , as generally observed for cosmic rays .",
    "observations have always been suggestive that magnetic reconnection can happen at a high speed in some circumstances , in spite of the theoretical difficulties in explaining it .",
    "for instance , the phenomenon of solar flares suggests that magnetic reconnection should be first slow in order to ensure the accumulation of magnetic flux and then suddenly become fast in order to explain the observed fast release of energy .",
    "the lv99 model can naturally explain this and other observational manifestations of magnetic reconnection .",
    "consider a particle entrained on a reconnected magnetic field line ( see fig.[fig : lv99model ] ) .",
    "this particle may bounce back and forth between magnetic mirrors formed by oppositely directed magnetic fluxes moving towards each other with the velocity @xmath0 .",
    "each bounce will increase the energy of a particle in a way consistent with the requirements of the first - order fermi process @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the second - order fermi acceleration that is frequently discussed in terms of accelerating particles by turbulence generated by reconnection @xcite .",
    "the numerical studies of the particle acceleration supporting these ideas have been already started @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of this acceleration mechanism is that it is also potentially testable observationally , since the resulting spectrum of accelerated particles is different from that arising from a shock .",
    "@xcite used this mechanism of particle acceleration to explain the synchrotron power - law spectrum arising from the flares of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "further applications can be found in the solar physics .",
    "following @xcite we note that solar flares inspired much of the earlier research on reconnection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the plasma involved is substantially rarefied , the restrictive conditions for the collisionless reconnection are satisfied in this particular environment .",
    "@xcite stated that bistable hall reconnection can be important in this case .",
    "stochastic reconnection provides an alternative explanation .",
    "indeed , an important prediction of the lv99 model is related to the _ reconnection instability _ that arises in the situation when the initial structure of the flux prior to reconnection is laminar .",
    "reconnection at the sweet - parker rate is negligible .",
    "this allows magnetic flux to accumulate .",
    "however , when the degree of stochasticity exceeds a threshold value , the reconnection itself should excite more turbulence , creating a positive feedback resulting in a flare ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the instability is a generic property of laminar field reconnection in both collisionless and collisional environments . referring to the sun",
    ", one may speculate that the difference between gradual and eruptive flares arises from the original state of magnetic field prior to the flare , at least in some specific situations . in the case",
    "when the magnetic field is sufficiently turbulent the accumulation of magnetic flux does not happen and the flare is gradual .",
    "similarly , the observed spatial spread of energy release during solar flares may be due to the spread of the region of turbulent fields once reconnection is initiated at one place .",
    "recent observations demonstrate that gradual flares occur rather in regions with large scale and weak magnetic fields for which alfvn times are large @xcite . in light of that",
    ", the difference in alfvn times may explain different time scales in gradual and impulsive flares .",
    "further research is necessary for establishing the role of turbulence in changing the time scale of flare evolution",
    ".    the lv99 model can find its application in the removal of magnetic flux from the star formation regions .",
    "@xcite showed that magnetic field is removed from the star forming core cluster faster than it is allowed by the standard ambipolar diffusion scenario @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a mechanism using efficient reconnection through `` hyper - resistivity '' .",
    "@xcite performed numerical studies of such a concept , replacing the `` hyper - resistivity '' with efficient stochastic reconnection .",
    "they reported removal of strong anticorrelations of magnetic field through `` reconnection diffusion '' , which can mimic the effect of enhanced ohmic resistivity .",
    "lv99 showed that fast reconnection of stochastic magnetic field makes the models of strong mhd turbulence self - consistent , because the critical balance in the gs95 model requires the existence of eddy - type motions perpendicular to the magnetic field . in the absence of reconnection",
    "this would result in unresolved knots that should drain energy from the cascade .",
    "the estimates in lv99 showed that the rates of reconnection predicted by the model are sufficient to resolve magnetic knots within one period .",
    "the lv99 model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of weakly stochastic magnetic fields was proposed by @xcite in @xcite . however , due to a few objective factors it met less enthusiasm in the community than , for example , the x - point collisionless reconnection .",
    "we believe that there were three major factors responsible for this .    1 .",
    "the collisionless x - point reconnection was initiated and supported by numerical simulations , while lv99 was a theory .",
    "its numerical testing became possible only recently .",
    "the reconnection subject had a history of failed theories and models , which without direct numerical support were taken with a grain of salt .",
    "the acceptance of the idea of astrophysical fluids generically being in turbulent state had much less observational support at that time compared to the present day .",
    "by now we have much more evidence which allows to claim that models not taking the pre - existent turbulence has little relevance to astrophysics .",
    "the analytical solutions of lv99 were based on the use of gs95 model of turbulence .",
    "the gs95 model of turbulence , in fact , was extended lv99 by introducing the concept of local reference frame for turbulent eddies and by extending the gs95 scalings to the subalfvnic case .",
    "the gs95 theory was far from being generally accepted at the time of the lv99 publishing .",
    "the situation has changed substantially by now .",

    "finally , the situation has changed with the numerical testing of the lv99 model .",
    "the 3d mhd simulations in @xcite supported the predictions in the lv99 paper and our present work goes further with testing this model , by including different types of energy injection .",
    "it is worth noting also , that there is some implicit observational evidence in the favor of the lv99 model , like observations of the thick reconnection current outflow regions observed in the solar flares @xcite .",
    "@xcite , explaining quasi - periodic pulsations in observed flaring energy releases at an active region above the sunspot , proposed that the wave packets arising from the sunspots can trigger such pulsations .",

    "we found that :    * we observe similar changes of the topology of the magnetic field near the interface of oppositely directed magnetic field lines in models with two different turbulence injection mechanisms .",
    "these changes include the fragmentation of the current sheet , favoring multiple simultaneous reconnection events , as well as a substantial increase in the thickness of the outflow of reconnected magnetic flux and matter . *",
    "the relation between the reconnection rate @xmath0 and turbulent power @xmath1 remains unchanged under two different mechanisms of energy injection and is confirmed by new models to be @xmath168 , in agreement with the lv99 prediction .",

    "<S> we study a model of fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of weak turbulence proposed by @xcite using three - dimensional direct numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the model has been already successfully tested in @xcite confirming the dependencies of the reconnection speed @xmath0 on the turbulence injection power @xmath1 and the injection scale @xmath2 expressed by a constraint @xmath3 and no observed dependency on ohmic resistivity . in @xcite , in order to drive turbulence , we injected velocity fluctuations in fourier space with frequencies concentrated around @xmath4 , as described in alvelius ( 1999 ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend our previous studies by comparing fast magnetic reconnection under different mechanisms of turbulence injection by introducing a new way of turbulence driving . </S>",
    "<S> the new method injects velocity or magnetic eddies with a specified amplitude and scale in random locations directly in real space . </S>",
    "<S> we provide exact relations between the eddy parameters and turbulent power and injection scale . </S>",
    "<S> we performed simulations with new forcing in order to study turbulent power and injection scale dependencies . </S>",
    "<S> the results show no discrepancy between models with two different methods of turbulence driving exposing the same scalings in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the lazarian & vishniac ( 1999 ) predictions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we performed a series of models with varying viscosity @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> although lazarian & vishniac ( 1999 ) do not provide any prediction for this dependence , we report a weak relation between the reconnection speed with viscosity , @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields are observed in many astrophysical objects and usually play an important or even crucial role in their dynamics ( see * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * e.g. ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are a key ingredient of astrophysical processes such as magneto - rotational instability , magnetic dynamo , transport and acceleration of cosmic rays , accretion disks , turbulence , solar phenomena , gamma ray bursts , etc . @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields are solenoidal and evolve only through changes in the curl of the electric field . in the limit of zero resistivity </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the field lines is a constant of motion and the magnetic flux threading any fluid element is constant . </S>",
    "<S> generating large scale magnetic fields requires some kind of battery effect , like the biermann battery @xcite and generating strong large scale magnetic fields requires a dynamo ( see * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * for example ) . in the limit of very small resistivity , which is typical for astrophysical objects , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic flux is `` frozen in '' and magnetic field lines will resist passing through one another or changing their topology @xcite . due to the presence of plasma motions , in particular turbulence , this would result in a very complex tangle of field lines in real objects , with negligible large scale magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> however , observations indicate that the mean and turbulent components of magnetic fields in many astrophysical objects are of similar strengths ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the existence of a process which can violate the frozen - in condition on dynamical time scales , i.e. fast magnetic field reconnection .    </S>",
    "<S> the first analytic model for magnetic reconnection was proposed independently by @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sweet - parker reconnection has the virtue that it relies on a robust and straightforward geometry . </S>",
    "<S> two regions with uniform magnetic fields are separated by thin current sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the speed of reconnection is given roughly by the resistivity divided by the sheet thickness . </S>",
    "<S> however , the plasma in the current sheet is constrained to move along the local field lines , and is ejected from the edge of the current sheet at the alfvn speed , @xmath7 . since the width of the current sheet limits the flux of expelled plasma , the overall reconnection speed is reduced from the alfvn speed by the square root of the lundquist number , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the resistivity and @xmath10 is the length of the current sheet . in most astrophysical contexts </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 is very large and the sweet - parker reconnection speed , @xmath12 , is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> fast reconnection requires that the dependence on @xmath9 be erased . </S>",
    "<S> given the simplicity of the sweet - parker setup , this requires that the simple geometry of the current sheet must be broken .    </S>",
    "<S> the realization that sweet - parker reconnection is inadequate to explain magnetic reconnection in an astrophysical context was immediately apparent , and gave rise to decades of research on models of fast reconnection ( see * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * for reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first proposal was to replace the current sheet with an x - point configuration , so that the `` sheet '' thickness and length are comparable . this is the basis for petschek s model of fast reconnection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a dynamically self - consistent x - point requires that the outflow prevent a general collapse into a narrow current sheet . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise we would expect that the same bulk forces that brought the magnetic field lines together would lead to sweet - parker reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed that slow - mode shocks on either side of the x - point would serve this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , those shocks are responsible for converting most of the magnetic energy into the heat and kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the x - point in this model has an overall size which depends on resistivity , but since the magnetic field decrease logarithmically when approaching the current sheet ( due to the assumption of the current - free magnetic field in the inflow region ) , the resulting reconnection speed is some fraction of @xmath7 . numerical simulations with uniform resistivity @xcite have showed that in the mhd limit the shocks fade away and the contact region expands into a sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the only way to make the petschek configuration stable is by introducing the local nonuniform resistivity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this leaves the possibility that x - point reconnection is stable when the plasma is collisionless . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations @xcite have been encouraging . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are several important issues that remain unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is not clear that this kind of fast reconnection persists on scales greater than the ion inertial scale ( see * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> several numerical studies @xcite have found large scale reconnection speeds which depend on resistivity , i.e. are not fast . </S>",
    "<S> second , in many circumstances the magnetic field geometry does not allow the formation of x - point reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a saddle - shaped current sheet can not be spontaneously replaced by an x - point . </S>",
    "<S> the energy required to do so is comparable to the magnetic energy liberated by reconnection , and must be available beforehand . finally , the requirement that reconnection occur in a collision less plasma restricts this model to a small fraction of astrophysical applications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , while reconnection in stellar coronae might be described in this way , stellar chromospheres are not . </S>",
    "<S> more generally @xcite estimated that the scale of the reconnection sheet should not exceed about 40 times the electron mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is not satisfied in many environments which one might naively consider to be collisionless , among them the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion that stellar interiors and atmospheres , accretion disks , and the interstellar medium in general does not allow fast reconnection is drastic and unpalatable .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to the x - point geometry is to consider magnetic fields that are chaotic , even if only weakly so . requiring the plasma to flow along the local magnetic field implies a powerful constraint on reconnection only if the field lines themselves are laminar . </S>",
    "<S> ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * hereinafter lv99 ) proposed a model for fast reconnection which depends on the presence of turbulence , and its production of weakly stochastic field lines ( also briefly described in section  [ sec : lv99model ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence is a natural consequence of convection in stars and of the magnetorotational instability in accretion disks ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is now generally accepted that the `` big power law in the sky '' indicates the presence of turbulence on scales from tens of parsecs to thousands of kilometers @xcite . among other sources , </S>",
    "<S> evidence for this comes from studies of atomic hydrogen spectra in molecular clouds and galaxies ( see * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> lv99 s model uses the properties of turbulence to predict broad outflows from extended current sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusivity of magnetic field line trajectories in a turbulent plasma implies that flows can follow local magnetic field lines without being confined to the current sheet . </S>",
    "<S> when the turbulent diffusivity is less than the ohmic resistivity , this model reduces to the sweet - parker reconnection model .    </S>",
