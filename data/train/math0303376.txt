    "a young diagram is a graphic representation of a partition @xmath0 of an integer @xmath1 .",
    "continual _ young diagram is the continous analogue of this , namely a positive increasing function @xmath2 defined on some interval @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "greene , nijenhuis and wilf ( 1979 , 1984 ) introduced two random walks on young diagrams called the _",
    "hook walks_. these random walks continue until reaching some terminal point on the boundary of the diagram . by analyzing the probability distributions of these terminal points , they reproved two important formulas in the combinatorics of young diagrams .",
    "kerov ( 1993 ) generalized one of the walks to continual young diagrams .",
    "this random walk converges to a limiting point on the boundary of the diagram , and kerov conjectured a formula for the density of this limiting point , in the case where this random variable is in fact absolutely continuous .    in this paper",
    ", we give a unified treatment of both random walks .",
    "we prove kerov s formula under fairly mild assumptions on the smoothness of the diagram , and present a new explicit formula for the density of the limiting point of the second hook walk .",
    "the fact that these expressions are probability densities , and thus integrate to @xmath4 , leads to some surprising integration relations ; two examples are : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8\\bigg\\}dx\\ ] ] which holds for any positive , increasing , smooth function @xmath2 on @xmath9 $ ] that satisfies @xmath10 , and having first derivative bounded away from @xmath11 and infinity and second derivative bounded ; and @xmath12 @xmath13}\\right.dx , \\ ] ] which holds for any smooth function @xmath14 on @xmath15 $ ] which is bounded between @xmath16 and @xmath17 for some @xmath18 .",
    "we also solve the inverse problem : that of finding the shape of the diagram , when given the probability density of the limiting point of the random walk . two inverse formulas are given , one for each of the two walks .",
    "for the walk that was treated by kerov , the correspondence between the shape of the diagram and the probability density of the limiting point of the walk is closely related to the so - called markov transform ( see kerov ( 1998 ) ) . in this case , our explicit formulas enable the direct calculation of the markov transform and its inverse .",
    "the markov transform has found several applications , notably to dirichlet priors in statistics , so the inverse formula may well be applicable to that problem , a possibility that diaconis and kemperman ( 1996 ) seem to hint at in their very readable review of the subject .",
    "we remark that the importance of the continual hook walk is best understood in connection with the asymptotic theory of plancherel measure on the symmetric group .",
    "kerov ( 1999 ) showed that the probability density of the limiting point of the walk ( the so - called transition measure - see section 2 below ) governs the dynamical system of the evolution of a random ( plancherel - distributed ) young diagram , and used this to illuminate the beautiful vershik - kerov / logan - shepp limit shape theorem for irreducible representations of the symmetric group .",
    "the transition measure has also appeared in recent work of ivanov and olshanski ( 2001 ) , where it was shown that the transition measure of a random plancherel - distributed young diagram converges to the semicircle distribution , and that the deviation from the semicircle distribution satisfies a central limit theorem .",
    "the form of the limiting gaussian process in this central limit theorem exhibits a surprising resemblance to empirical eigenvalue distribution deviations appearing in the gue random matrix model , a phenomenon that is not yet fully understood .    in section 2",
    "we give the required definitions and terminology of continual young diagrams and the hook walks .",
    "we concentrate on `` rotated '' young diagrams , so that instead of increasing functions we shall be dealing with 1-lipschitz functions . however , because of the esthetic appeal in working with increasing functions , we translate some of the formulas for those functions . in section 3",
    "we present the main results , namely the formulas for the densities of the terminating point of the hook walks , together with the associated integration relations , and the inversion formulas .",
    "we also include a simple asymptotic result on the location of the roots of the polynomial @xmath19 , which in a sense inspires the computation for the inverse formulas .",
    "in section 4 we review some of the elementary properties of the hook walks . the approach using moments is emphasized and some of the results there may be of independent interest , although the main goal is to prepare for the proofs of the main results , which are given in sections 5 and 6 .",
