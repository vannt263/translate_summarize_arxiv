    "large - scale jets of kpc - mpc size have been observed in radio images of radio - loud agn almost since their discovery , but only more recently has high - resolution imaging with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory shown that the knots in many of these large - scale jets often produce significant high - energy radiation . since the first ( serendipitous ) _ chandra _ detection of a large - scale x - ray jet in pks 0637 - 752 @xcite , several dozen have been discovered ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , spanning a range from typically lower radio power fanaroff and riley ( fr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) type i to more powerful fr ii type radio galaxies .    with high - resolution multi - band imaging , we are now able to build reliable spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the large - scale jet ( lsj ) emission , separate from the blazar core . in many cases ,",
    "the spectra of the knots appears consistent with a single synchrotron origin from radio to x - rays , as seen in m87 @xcite , b2 0331 + 39 @xcite , and 3c 31 @xcite , and several others , all notably fr i sources .",
    "however , in several of the more powerful ( typically fr ii ) sources , the x - ray spectrum in the knots is clearly much harder and/or higher than would be consistent with the radio - optical synchrotron spectrum , as first observed by @xcite and @xcite for pks 0637 - 752 .        [",
    "fig : lc ]    based on that finding , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the x - rays could be due to ic / cmb photons by relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the ic / cmb model has since been applied to other jets with x - rays inconsistent with their radio - optical synchrotron spectra , including the well - studied source 3c 273 @xcite , and many more fr ii x - ray jets subsequently discovered ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; see also the ` two - zone ' ic / cmb model for pks 1127 - 145 of @xcite ) . generally , the ic / cmb model requires that the jet remain highly relativistic out to the location of the x - ray knots ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath3 ) , point close to our line of sight , and have an electron energy distribution ( eed ) extending down to energies @xmath4 mev , significantly lower than the @xmath4 gev electron energies traced by ghz synchrotron radio emission . to produce the observed x - ray flux ,",
    "ic / cmb requires high , sometimes super - eddington jet kinetic power @xcite , due to the low radiative efficiency of these electrons .",
    "also , the small angle to the line of sight in several cases requires mpc - scale de - projected jet lengths , as long as the longest radio galaxies observed @xcite .",
    "deep hst imaging photometry of the knots in pks 1136 - 135 also reveals ` improbability ' issues with the ic / cmb model , with the observed optical polarization exceeding 30% ; applying the ic / cmb model requires a significantly super - eddington jet longer than a mpc , forming a @xmath5 angle to the line of sight and having a doppler beaming factor @xmath620 @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the x - rays in powerful sources is synchrotron emission from an additional electron energy distribution ( eed ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the synchrotron emission mechanism is far more efficient than ic / cmb , it does not require the high lorentz factors , extreme jet lengths or near - eddington jet powers , as the ic / cmb model does in several cases @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear what physical mechanism might produce this second eed , and in some cases the observed sed requires the high - energy particle population to have a difficult - to - explain low - energy cutoff at @xmath7 tev energies , where fast cooling is unavoidable @xcite .",
    "one of the best - studied lsjs is seen in the powerful nearby ( z=0.158 ) quasar 3c 273 .",
    "imaging in all bands reveals similar features , with a knotty jet beginning about 12 from the blazar core and extending a further 12 downstream .",
    "extensive observations with hst , _ spitzer _ , and _ chandra _ have revealed that the knots are characterized by two spectral components , one with a cutoff above 5@xmath810@xmath9 hz and a high - energy one connecting the optical - uv and x - ray data @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter g06 ) , showed that while the radio to x - ray sed of this source alone can not discriminate between the ic / cmb and synchrotron models , _ gamma - ray _ observations , specifically with _ fermi _ , may be able to do so .",
    "as discussed in g06 , if the x - rays from the 3c 273 jet are due to ic / cmb , a hard , steady spectrum is also expected in the gamma - rays by extension ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if _ fermi _ detects this emission ( or puts limits on it ) at a level significantly below what is expected by extrapolation from the x - rays , the ic / cmb model for the x - rays will be ruled out .",
    "the competing ic / cmb and synchrotron models imply radically different views of the lsj power , bulk lorentz factor , and the efficiency of particle acceleration , resulting in very different impacts on the host galaxy and surrounding environment .",
    "the persistently open question of the nature of the x - rays is critical not only for understanding jet physics but also for our understanding of agn activity as a feedback mechanism in galaxy formation , yet until now no conclusive evidence has arisen to eliminate either model .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the gamma - rays of 3c 273 for evidence of the expected hard , flat spectrum from ic / cmb which has been suggested as the source of the x - rays in this and other powerful lsjs . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we discuss the method of the _ fermi _ data analysis and our finding that no ic / cmb emission has been detected . in section  [ sec : results ] we discuss the resulting upper limit on the ic / cmb emission along with constraints on the doppler beaming factor . in section  [ sec : bulkgamma ] we derive a limit for the bulk lorentz factor based on our _ fermi _ result .",
    "we first computed the lightcurve of 3c 273 using bins of equal good time interval ( gti ) time , totaling 648000 seconds ( 7.5 days ) per bin , corresponding to a range of 15 - 23 days in real time . using the standard pipeline tools ( version v9r27p1 ) and the latest instrument response function ( p7source_v6 ) , the flux of 3c 273 was calculated using ( unbinned ) maximum likelihood with the gtlike tool .",
    "we used a region of interest ( roi ) of 7 degrees ; all sources ( 29 ) listed in the two - year catalog ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within 15 degrees of the position of 3c 273 were included in the initial model . in some bins ,",
    "known sources which were undetected were removed in order to gain convergence .",
    "3c 273 was modeled as a simple powerlaw with spectral index and normalization free . when the test statistic ( ts , roughly equivalent to significance squared ) for 3c 273 was @xmath1010 , we used the fermi upperlimit tool which uses the profile likelihood method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , freezing the other source parameters to generate upper limits .",
    "the lightcurve of 3c 273 from 4 august 2008 to 11 march 2013 ( _ fermi _ mission elapsed time ( met ) 239557417 to 384684952 seconds ) is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] , with total flux versus the central met of the corresponding bin in the upper panel , and test statistic versus the latter in the lower panel .",
    "previous calculations ( g06 ) have shown that it may be possible to detect the hard , steady component from ic / cmb by the lsj when the competing blazar emission is at a minimum",
    ". however , the analysis is complicated by the fact that _ fermi _ lacks the spatial resolution to resolve the lsj separately from the blazar core , as the _ fermi _ angular resolution ranges from 3.5@xmath11 at 100 mev down to @xmath12 above 10 gev , at which point it is still an order of magnitude larger than the scale of the lsj . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : lc ] , the core appears to dominate the emission , with significant short - term variability with timescales on the order of the bin widths .    in order to gain the increased sensitivity of a longer integration time on the source",
    "while avoiding times where the blazar may come ` up ' during an otherwise quiescent period , we used a progressive binning approach , in which the lightcurve bins were ordered by total flux .",
    "beginning with the bin with lowest flux , we then added the next - highest bin ( not necessarily contiguous ) in succession and re - ran the likelihood analysis for the combined timeframe at each addition .",
    "the sed was divided into the five ` standard ' energy ranges used in the 2fgl : 100 - 300 mev , 300 mev-1 gev , 1 - 3 gev , 3 - 10 gev , and 10 - 100 gev . as above , when a given energy bin found ts@xmath1010 , an upper limit was calculated .",
    "overall , the flux calculations behaved as expected : initially all bands were upper limits , which became progressively lower as more time bins were used , up to the point where the blazar was detected , when the flux values began increasing in the lower - energy bins ( see figure  [ fig : lc]c ) .",
    "the two highest energy bins ( 3 - 10 gev and 10 - 100 gev ) gave only upper limit fluxes during the entire analysis , reaching a minimum after the 25 lowest bins were analyzed together .",
    "the inclusion of bins after the 25th lowest only increased fluxes ( or upper limits ) in all energy bands .",
    "therefore we report the 95% , 99% and 99.9% upper limits on the fluxes in the 3 - 10 and 10 - 100 gev bands in table  [ table : fermi ] using these 25 bins , in addition to the detected total fluxes in the first three bins .",
    "we note that the background at energies @xmath13 3 gev from nearby sources is very low as the nearest source ( pks 1217 + 02 ) is at a distance of almost 5 times the 95% containment radius at this energy ( @xmath70.5@xmath11 ) .",

    "the final 5-band sed points are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "it is clear that the first three bins are a representation of the low - level blazar sed , which is apparently peaking before the _ fermi _ band and rapidly falling off in the high - energy range .",
    "the two upper limits shown are thus upper limits for both the blazar emission and the expected hard , steady component from ic / cmb , with the 3 - 10 gev limit being the most constraining .",
    "in the ic / cmb model , the gev emission is predetermined by the requirement that ic / cmb emission gives the observed x - ray flux . consider the synchrotron sed of knot a ( figure [ knota ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron emitting electrons will unavoidably produce an ic / cmb component ( g06 ) identical to the synchrotron one but with a shift in peak frequency @xmath18 and a shift in peak luminosity @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the peak ec and synchrotron frequencies , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the peak ec and synchrotron luminosities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath26 g , @xmath27 is the magnetic field in gauss , @xmath28 hz and @xmath29 erg @xmath30 are the cmb peak frequency and energy density at @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the doppler factor , and the last part of each equation holds for equipartition conditions ( @xmath33 g ; * ? ? ? * ) .    , and @xmath1 upper limits described in  [ sec : methods ] and table [ table : fermi ] .",

    ".      radio polarization maps @xcite show that the jet magnetic field runs roughly parallel to the jet from knot a all the way to knot d1 . beyond knot d1",
    "the magnetic field turns abruptly to become orthogonal to the jet axis , as one would expect from a shock that decelerates the flow , and compresses the plasma .",
    "the polarization is suggestive of a jet that does not decelerate substantially from knot a to knot d1 , but decelerates efficiently past knot d1 .",
    "it is thus plausible that the flow from knot a to d1 is characterized by a single doppler factor , and that the magnetic field does not vary significantly , as suggested by the fact that the equipartition magnetic field of all knots is the same within a factor @xmath102 @xcite .    , and a hess upper limit @xcite .",
