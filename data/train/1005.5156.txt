    "the answer turns out to be equivalent to improved intersection numbers introduced by givental in @xcite ( in spite of this , there are obvious philosophical differences between the two approaches ; givental s definition of @xmath25-intersection numbers uses the entire milnor fibration , rather than just a fibre , and is also highly unsymmetric ) .    for the next example , we need a slight variation of the previous discussion .",
    "suppose that we have a lefschetz fibration @xmath529 whose base is a once - punctured plane ( say @xmath606 , with symplectic form @xmath607 ) .",
    "there are now outer monodromies around both @xmath608 and @xmath609 , and we assume that the first of these is trivial . otherwise , the assumptions are analogous to those in definition [ def : lefschetz ] . on the base",
    "choose the function @xmath610 , where the constants are @xmath611 and a small @xmath547 . use this and a function @xmath534 on the fibre to define @xmath550 as in .",
    "then , an argument similar to the proof of lemma [ th : lefschetz - sequence ] applies , which we will now sketch briefly .",
    "critical points of type ( i ) form a copy of @xmath612 , and have action value @xmath154 .",
    "there is an @xmath121 of critical points of type ( ii ) for each one - periodic point of the flow of @xmath534 , with negative action value .",
    "finally , critical points of type ( iii ) again come from the singularities of the lefschetz fibration , and have positive actions . in the analogue of",
    ", we have @xmath613 .",
    "define @xmath575 to be supported in a small neighbourhood of @xmath614 and invariant under @xmath568 .",
    "then , the argument concerning applies as before , allowing us to determine the subcomplex consisting of generators of type ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the outcome is a long exact sequence analogous to , of the form @xmath615 \\longrightarrow { \\mathit{hf}}^*(h_m )",
    "\\longrightarrow { \\mathit{hf}}^*(h_f ) \\otimes h^*(s^1;{\\mathbb{k } } ) \\rightarrow \\cdots\\ ] ] ( for another occurrence of the same geometric situation , see ( * ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) ) . by the same kind of argument , the bv operator on the last term is @xmath616 \\otimes \\mathrm{id}$ ] .",
    "this leads to the same consequence as in proposition [ th : lefschetz ] .",
    "consider what one might call the three - dimensional `` affine @xmath617 type milnor fibre '' , namely @xmath618 with the trivialization of its canonical bundle given by @xmath619 .",
    "the geometry is similar to the @xmath591 case of example [ th : an ] , except that lagrangian spheres @xmath620 are now associated to paths @xmath98 in @xmath621 with endpoints @xmath622 .",
    "take the two spheres @xmath372 associated to arcs in the lower and upper half - planes , respectively .",
    "for an appropriate choice of gradings , @xmath623 we know from the generalization of proposition [ th : lefschetz ] mentioned above that @xmath3 admits a solution of .",
    "in fact , again taking @xmath624 for simplicity , it admits an infinite family of such solutions , of the form @xmath625 , where @xmath626 is the image in @xmath70 of the generator of @xmath627 . passing from @xmath459 to",
    "@xmath625 changes the action of @xmath600 on @xmath628 by some @xmath132 , and that on @xmath629 by @xmath630 .",
    "hence , by a suitable choice of dilation @xmath22 and of the @xmath22-equivariant structure , one can achieve that @xmath48 acts as @xmath603 on @xmath631 .",
    "the same will then be true for the other groups @xmath632 as well .",
    "in the examples above , we have paid particular attention to the case when the action of @xmath48 is proportional to the grading .",
    "this is motivated by the following purely algebraic observation .",
    "let @xmath633 be an @xmath69-algebra over a field @xmath74 of characteristic zero , and @xmath634 its cohomology algebra .",
    "there are canonical maps between hochschild cohomology groups , @xmath635 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath636 is the center of @xmath637 , which is itself graded , and similarly for @xmath638 .",
    "suppose that there is a @xmath639 such that @xmath640 , and @xmath641 agrees with the euler derivation ( the one that multiplies the degree @xmath642 part of @xmath637 by @xmath642 ) up to inner derivations .",
    "one can prove that if this is the case , then @xmath633 is formal ( quasi - isomorphic to its cohomology ) . via the abstract approach outlined in remark [ th :",
    "theory ] , this has potential applications to fukaya categories .",
    "as mentioned briefly in section [ sec : tqft ] , we want an @xmath69-algebra with vanishing compositions of order @xmath643 to be exactly the same as a differential graded algebra ( with the standard koszul signs ) .",
    "the sign conventions therefore follow @xcite while differing from @xcite . explicitly ,",
    "if @xmath644 is an @xmath69-structure in our sense , translation into an @xmath69-structure @xmath645 in the sense of @xcite is achieved by setting @xmath646 in floer theory , signs appear through gluing formulae for determinant lines of ( real ) elliptic operators . in particular , koszul signs are natural from that point of view , since the determinant line should be understood as an object whose ( formal ) parity is given by the index of the elliptic operator .",
    "there is an additional source of signs , namely the orientations of various moduli spaces of riemann surfaces .",
    "our convention for @xmath69-structures arises from certain choices of orientations of the stasheff polyhedra @xmath647 , whereas the convention from @xcite is obtained by making an additional ad hoc sign change ; one can see this by comparing with ( * ? ? ? * equation ( 12.24 ) ) .",
    "the same principle applies to other constructions in the paper .",
    "for instance , consider the first three terms on the right hand side of , which are all of the same overall form .",
    "for the one - dimensional stasheff moduli space @xmath648 underlying @xmath649 , we choose an orientation by varying the marked point corresponding to @xmath650 along the boundary of the disc ( with its natural orientation ) , while keeping the other three marked points fixed .",
    "similarly , for the two - dimensional moduli space @xmath651 underlying @xmath652 , we vary the interior marked point corresponding to @xmath22 over the disc ( with its natural orientation ) , while keeping the boundary marked points fixed .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : hex ] , the compactification @xmath653 has three boundary strata which are naturally identified with copies of @xmath648 .",
    "figure [ fig : halfplane ] shows the riemann surfaces described by points in @xmath651 close to each of these boundary strata ( for reasons which will become clear presently , it is convenient to draw these surfaces as punctured upper half planes rather than discs ; the marked point at `` @xmath654 '' corresponds to the output of the operation ) .",
    "deforming the surface towards the boundary stratum corresponds to moving the interior marked point downwards ; deforming it parallel to the boundary stratum ( in the direction given by the orientation of @xmath648 ) corresponds to moving the rightmost boundary marked point to the right .",
    "one observes that the resulting local coordinates are compatible with the orientation we have chosen for @xmath651 in the first and third case , and opposite in the second case ; this explains the degree - independent part of the signs with which these terms appear in .",
    "figure [ fig : halfplane2 ] indicates the parallel argument for the other three terms on the right hand side of .",
    "formulae involving dehn twists , such as , can be analyzed in the same way ( that particular one is actually built from the same underlying moduli space @xmath651 ) .",
