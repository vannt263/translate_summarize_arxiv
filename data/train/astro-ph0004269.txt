    "a galactic microlensing event occurs when a massive , compact object ( the lens ) passes near to our line - of - sight to a more distant star ( the source ) .",
    "if the lens , observer , and source are perfectly aligned , then the lens images the source into a ring , called the einstein ring , which has angular radius of and @xmath0 , typical distances to the lens and source for microlensing events toward the bulge . ]",
    "@xmath1^{1/2 } \\sim 480 \\ , \\mu{\\rm as } \\left({m \\over m_{\\odot}}\\right)^{1/2 } , \\label{eqn : thetae}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the mass of the lens , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the lens - source , observer - source , and observer - lens distances , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a physical distance at the lens plane of @xmath6    if the lens is not perfectly aligned with the line - of - sight , then the lens splits the source into two images .",
    "the separation of these images is @xmath7 and hence unresolvable .",
    "however , the source is also magnified by the lens , by an amount that depends on the angular separation between the lens and source in units of @xmath8 . since the lens , observer , and source are all in relative motion , this magnification is a function of time : a ` microlensing event . '",
    "the time scale for such an event is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the relative lens - source proper motion .",
    "if the primary lens has a planetary companion , and the position of this companion happens to be in the path of one of the two images created during the primary event , then the planet will perturb the light from this image , creating a deviation from the primary light curve ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the duration of this perturbation is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass ratio between the planet and primary .",
    "hence , for a jupiter / sun mass ratio ( @xmath13 ) , the perturbation time scale is @xmath14 .",
    "these short - duration deviations are the signatures of planets orbiting the primary lenses .",
    "note that since the perturbation time scale is considerably less than @xmath15 , the majority of the light curve will be indistinguishable from a single lens .",
    "three parameters determine the magnitude of the perturbation , and hence define the observables .",
    "these are mass ratio @xmath12 , the instantaneous angular separation @xmath16 between the planet and primary in units of @xmath17 , and the angle @xmath18 between the projected planet / star axis and the path of the source . as @xmath12 decreases , the perturbation time scale decreases , although the magnitude of the deviation does not necessarily decrease .",
    "thus very small mass ratio planets ( @xmath19 ) can be detected using microlensing , although the detection probability is small .",
    "the lower limit to the detectable @xmath12 is set practically by the sampling of the primary event , and ultimately by the finite size of the source stars ( bennett & rhie 1996 ) .",
    "a microlensing event is generally alerted only if the minimum angular impact parameter in units of @xmath8 satisfies @xmath20 , which corresponds to image positions between @xmath21 .",
    "since the planet must be near one of these images to create a perturbation , microlensing is most sensitive to planets with separations @xmath22 , the ` lensing zone . '",
    "the angle @xmath18 , which is of no physical interest , is uniformly distributed .",
    "only certain values of @xmath18 will create detectable deviations .",
    "thus integration over @xmath18 defines a geometric detection probability .",
    "6.0 cm    microlensing as a method to detect extrasolar planets was first suggested by mao & ( 1991 ) , and was expanded upon by gould & loeb ( 1992 ) who demonstrated that if all lenses had a jupiter analog , than @xmath23 of all light curves should exhibit @xmath24 deviations . since these two seminal papers , many authors have explored the use of microlensing to detect planets .",
    "it is not our intention to provide a comprehensive review of this field .",
    "however , of particular relevance is the paper by griest & safizadeh ( 1998 , gs98 ) who demonstrated that , for high - magnification events ( those with maximum magnification @xmath25 ) , the detection probability for planets in the lensing zone is @xmath26 .",
    "thus high - magnification events are an extremely efficient means of detecting extrasolar planets .",
    "the results of gs98 also imply that multiple planets in the lensing zone should betray their presence in high - magnification events ( gaudi , naber & sackett 1998 ) .",
    "7.5 cm    the basic requirements to detect planets with microlensing are good temporal sampling and photometric precision .",
    "since the optical depth to microlensing is low , @xmath27 , the survey teams that discover microlensing events toward the galactic bulge must monitor of order one million stars on a nightly basis in order to detect any events .",
    "therefore , they generally have insufficient sampling to detect the short - duration perturbations to the primary light curve ( see , e.g. , figure 2 ) . however , these survey teams ( ogle , udalski et  al .  1994 ; macho , alcock et  al .  1996 ; eros ; glicenstein et  al . , these proceedings ) issue alerts ,",
    "notification of ongoing events .",
    "this allows follow - up collaborations ( gman , alcock et  al .",
    "1997 ; planet , albrow et  al.1998 ; mps , rhie et  al .",
    "1999 ; moa , yock , these proceedings ) to monitor these events frequently with high - quality photometry to search for planetary deviations .",
    "in particular , the planet collaboration has access to four telescopes located in chile , south africa , western australia , and tasmania , and can monitor events nearly round - the - clock , weather permitting .",
    "figure 2 shows planet photometry of an event alerted by the ogle collaboration , 14 .",
    "this was a high - magnification event ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 , making it an excellent candidate to search for planetary deviations .",
    "planet obtained a total of 600 data points for this event : 461 @xmath30-band and 139 @xmath31-band .",
    "the median sampling interval is about 1 hour , or @xmath32 , with very few gaps greater than 1 day .",
    "the @xmath33 scatter in @xmath30 over the peak of the event ( where the sensitivity to planets is the highest ) is @xmath34 .",
    "the dense sampling and excellent photometry means that our efficiency to detect massive companions should be quite high .",
    "in fact , examination of the residuals from a single lens model ( fig .",
    "2 ) reveal no obvious deviations of any kind .    to be more quantitative ,",
    "we simultaneously search for binary - lens fits and calculate the detection efficiency @xmath35 of 14 as a function of separation and mass ratio using a method proposed by gaudi & sackett ( 2000 ) . for details on the implementation for this event , see albrow et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we find no binary - lens models in the parameter ranges @xmath36 and @xmath37 that provide significantly ( @xmath38 ) better fits to the 14 dataset .",
    "we therefore conclude that the light curve of 14 is consistent with a single lens .    in figure 4",
    "we show the detection efficiency @xmath39 of our 14 dataset to companions as a function of the mass @xmath40 and orbital radius @xmath41 of the companion .",
    "parameter combinations shaded in black are excluded at the 95% significance level .",
    "stellar companions to the primary lens of 14 with separations between @xmath42 and @xmath43 are excluded .",
    "companions with mass @xmath44 are excluded between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "although we can not exclude a jupiter - mass companion at any separation , we had a @xmath47 chance of detecting such a companion at @xmath48 .",
    "the detection efficiency for 14 is @xmath49 at @xmath50 for all companion masses @xmath51 .",
    "we find that we had a @xmath52 chance of detecting a companion with the mass and separation of jupiter ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , and a @xmath55 chance of detecting a companion with the mass and separation of saturn ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) in the light curve of 14 .",
    "thus , although jupiter analogs can not be ruled out in 14 , the detection efficiencies are high enough that non - detections in several events with similar quality will be sufficient to place meaningful constraints on their abundance .",
    "how do the 14 efficiencies compare to planet detection via other methods ? in figure  4 we show the radial velocity detection limit on @xmath58 for a solar mass primary as a function of the semi - major axis for a velocity amplitude of @xmath59 , which is the limit found for the majority of the stars in the lick planet search ( cumming , marcy & butler 1999 ) .",
    "although we show this limit for the full range of @xmath41 , in reality the detection sensitivity extends only to @xmath60 due to the finite duration of radial - velocity planet searches and the fact that one needs to observe a significant fraction of an orbital period .",
    "in addition , we plot in figure  4 the @xmath61 and @xmath41 for planetary candidates detected in the lick survey .",
    "radial velocity searches clearly probe a different region of parameter space than microlensing , in particular , smaller separations .",
    "note , however , that our 14 data set gives us a @xmath62 chance of detecting analogs to two of these extrasolar planets : the third companion to upsilon and and the companion to 14 her .",
    "although the efficiency is low , we do have sensitivity to planets with masses as small as @xmath63 , considerably smaller than can be detected via radial velocity methods . for comparison",
    ", we also show in figure  10 the astrometric detection limit on @xmath40 for a @xmath64 primary at @xmath65 , for an astrometric accuracy of @xmath66 . for an astrometric campaign of @xmath67 years",
    ", this limit extends to @xmath68 .",
    "such an astrometric campaign ( @xmath69 years ) , would be sensitive to companions similar to those excluded in our analysis of 14 .",
    "the proposed space interferometry mission ( sim ) promises @xmath70 astrometric accuracy , which would permit the detection of considerably smaller mass companions",
    ".    9.0 cm",
    "clearly one can not make any statements about the population of the extrasolar planets as a whole based on one event .",
    "fortunately , planet has monitored , over the last five years , more than 100 events , a subset of which have temporal sampling and photometric accuracy similar to that of 14 . here",
    "we present a preliminary analysis of these events .",
    "we select 23 high - quality light curves from the 1998 - 1999 planet seasons and analyze these in the same manner as 14 ( albrow et  al .",
    "2000 ) . included in this sample",
    "are 5 high - magnification ( @xmath25 ) events : 14 , macho-1998-bul-35 , ogle-1999-blg-5 , ogle-1999-bul-35 and ogle-1999-bul-36 .",
    "we find that all 23 events are consistent with a single lens to within our detection threshold .",
    "using this null result , along with the detection efficiency @xmath71 for each event @xmath72 , we find a statistical upper limit to the fraction of these lenses that have a companion of a given separation and mass ratio .",
    "if the fraction of lenses with a companion as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath12 is @xmath73 , then probability that @xmath74 events with individual efficiencies @xmath71 would give a null result ( no detections ) is , @xmath75.\\ ] ] the 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "upper limit to @xmath73 is found by setting @xmath76 .    in figure 4",
    "we show the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits to @xmath73 for separations @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we convert these to limits on the fraction of lenses with companions of a given mass and physical separation by assuming that all the primaries have mass @xmath80 and distance @xmath81 .",
    "we find that @xmath82 of these lenses have jupiter mass planets with separations of 1.5 - 3 au .",
    "similarly , @xmath82 have planets of mass @xmath83 with separations of 1 - 4 au .",
    "although we can not place an interesting limit on jupiter analogs , we do find that @xmath84 of lenses have @xmath85 planets at the separation of jupiter ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "microlensing offers a unique and complementary method of detecting extrasolar planets .",
    "although many light curves have been monitored in the hopes of detecting the short - duration signature of planetary companions to the primary lenses , no convincing planetary detections have yet been made , despite the fact that data of sufficient quality are being acquired to detect such companions .",
    "these null results indicate that jupiter - mass companions with separations in the ` lensing zone , ' @xmath87 , occur is less than 1/3 of systems .",
    "the potential for this field is enormous .",
    "current microlensing searches for planets will continue to monitor events alerted toward the bulge , and either push these limits down to levels probed by radial velocity surveys ( @xmath55 ) , or finally detect planets , and measure the frequency of companions at separations more relevant to our solar system .",
    "next generation microlensing planet searches have the promise of obtaining a robust statistical estimate of the fraction of stars with planets of mass as low as that of the earth .",
    "we thank the macho , ogle and eros collaborations for providing real - time alerts .",
