    "<S> we study the potential to observe the charged higgs ; and it is found that the significance for discovering the charged higgs through @xmath15 is much lower than that through @xmath16 . with the luminosity of 100 fb@xmath17 at @xmath18 tev , the significance of the signal @xmath19 can reach around @xmath20 for @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) is one of minimal extensions of the standard model ( sm ) in the supersymmetric ( susy ) and non - susy frameworks . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar bosons in the model are two cp - even scalars @xmath22 , one cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath23 , and two charged higgs particles @xmath24 . to avoid the flavor - changing neutral currents at the tree level , a discrete symmetry is usually imposed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , according to the couplings to the fermions in the yukawa sector , several types non - susy thdm are classified in the literature  @xcite ; therefore , different types thdm may have different constraints on their masses and couplings .    with the discovery of a new scalar at the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , the mass of the sm - like higgs @xmath25 is determined to be @xmath26 gev . without fine - tuning the parameters in the scalar potential , the @xmath27 mass - square matrix ( @xmath28 ) elements of the cp - even scalars </S>",
    "<S> are expected to have the same order of magnitude . due to the sizable off - diagonal entries of @xmath28 , </S>",
    "<S> the mass splitting between the two cp - even higgs bosons can be up to a few hundred gev . for instance , if the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of @xmath28 are @xmath29 gev@xmath30 and @xmath31 gev@xmath30 , respectively , the masses of cp - even bosons are 126 gev and 583 gev .    among the classifications of the model , only type ii thdm has the same yukawa couplings as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is of importance that the charged higgs mass of this model has been bounded to be @xmath32 gev at @xmath33 confidence level ( cl )  @xcite by the precision measurement of @xmath34  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the constraint is insensitive to the parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of higgs doublet which couples to up(down)-type quarks . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the charged higgs in type ii thdm can not be a light particle , unless the model is further extended .    </S>",
    "<S> one of unsolved puzzles in particle physics is the origin of neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> if we regard that the neutrino masses arise from the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , like that in the sm and thdm , the minimal extension of the thdm is to add an @xmath37 higgs triplet @xmath38  @xcite . besides the new scalar bosons , </S>",
    "<S> doubly charged higgses @xmath39 and neutral scalars @xmath40 , a pair of new charged scalar bosons @xmath41 exist in such model . due to </S>",
    "<S> the strict constraint from the precision measurement of the electroweak @xmath42-parameter  @xcite , the vev of @xmath38 ( @xmath43 ) is limited to be @xmath44 gev . </S>",
    "<S> that is , before electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , the triplet scalar bosons are degenerate massive particles . </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily seen that if only one higgs doublet and one higgs triplet involve in a model , e.g. the so - called type ii seesaw model  @xcite , the mass splittings among the higgs triplet components are suppressed by @xmath45 , where the @xmath46 is the typical mass of higgs triplet . by assuming that @xmath47 are 100% decaying into leptons , the experimental lower bound on the @xmath46 currently is around 400 gev  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some interesting characteristics in the two - higgs - doublet ( thd ) type ii seesaw model are found  @xcite : ( i ) the mass splittings among the triplet components can be of the @xmath48 ; ( ii ) the doubly charged higgses @xmath47 have a complete new dominant decay pattern , e.g. , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are the lightest singly charged higgs ; ( iii ) the @xmath50 can be as light as @xmath1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics ascribe to the new interactions in the scalar potential , and we summarize them as  @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the higgs doublets , @xmath53 is the second pauli matrix , and @xmath54 are the mass dimension - one parameters and can be of the order of electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the vev of @xmath38 then can be simplified as : @xmath55 where the detailed expression can be found in  @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the small @xmath43 can be achieved by taking proper values of @xmath54 . according to the results of @xmath56 , </S>",
    "<S> the off - diagonal singly charged higgs mass - square matrix can be compatible to @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; and following the earlier discussions on the case of two cp - even bosons , one indeed can obtain the light charged higgs with a mass of 100 gev , even @xmath59 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the only price that we need to pay is to introduce a mixing effect between @xmath60 and @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> direct searches for a light charged higgs were performed at the lhc with @xmath617 tev  @xcite and 8 tev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although significant events above backgrounds have not yet found , the search of a light charged higgs still continues and is an interesting issue at the lhc  @xcite . based on the characters of thd type ii seesaw model , in this work we study the possible signatures of the light charged higgs at the lhc . since the triplet charged higgses @xmath41 can couple to @xmath62 at the tree level , the decays @xmath15 are sizable when @xmath63 ; therefore , we separate the light charged higgs mass to two ranges ( i ) @xmath64 and ( ii ) @xmath10 , where the light charged higgs predominantly decays to @xmath11 , @xmath65 , @xmath9 , and @xmath66 in the former range , while it decays to @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and @xmath66 in the latter range . since we do not have any information about the mass of pseudoscalar boson ( @xmath67 ) , we omit the discussions for the decays @xmath68 by assuming @xmath69 in the study range of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is supported by the recent cms measurement , where the mass @xmath70 in the range @xmath71 gev at small @xmath3 has been excluded  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decays @xmath72 could be interesting processes to probe the charged higgs , however , the vertices are suppressed by @xmath73 , which has been strictly limited by the current higgs data  @xcite . although it is not necessary , for simplicity we adopt @xmath74 in this analysis .    in order to study the light charged higgs production and decays , in the following we briefly introduce the relevant mixing and couplings . as discussed earlier , the singly charged higgses @xmath60 and @xmath41 can mix together due to the interactions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : vphidelta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize the physical charged higgs states as : @xmath75 where @xmath76 are identified as the lighter ( heavier ) charged higgses . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the yukawa couplings of @xmath50 to the sm quarks are given by : @xmath77 d h^+   + h.c.\\ , , \\label{eq : qyu } % % % & + \\sqrt{2 } \\bar \\nu_l v_{\\rm pmns } \\left [ -\\frac{\\tan\\beta}{v } { \\bf m_\\ell }    \\right ] \\ell_r h^+ + h.c.\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have suppressed the flvaor indices , @xmath78 stands for the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , and @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily obtain the lepton yukawa couplings if the quark masses and ckm matrix are replaced by the lepton masses and pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the radiative @xmath0 decays via the charged higgs can be suppressed by @xmath80 in the decay amplitude ; the constraint on the light charged higgs then is relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> we write the feynman rules for the gauge interactions to be @xmath81 where we have used the basis of @xmath60 and @xmath41 instead of @xmath50 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 can be @xmath60 and @xmath41 , @xmath84 denote the momenta of charged particles , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the @xmath88 coupling is suppressed by @xmath89 , however , when @xmath90 , its magnitude is compatible to @xmath91 the coupling of @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the mass range ( i ) , the relative branching ratios ( brs ) for @xmath15 and @xmath93 are sensitive to the @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> after introducing relevant couplings , we then study the partial decay rates of the charged higgs for those channels which are kinematically allowed . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in the mass range ( i ) the partial decay rate indeed is dominated by the three - body decay @xmath94 , and its expression is written as : @xmath95 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times \\left [ 2p_t\\cdot p_{b2 } + \\frac{1}{m^2_w } \\left ( ( q^2 -m^2_b)^2 -m^4_w\\right ) \\right ] d_3(ps)\\ , , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the inner products of the particle momenta , and @xmath98 denotes the phase space factor of the three - body decay ; in sum , they are given by : @xmath99 as for the dominant two - body decays , they are formulated as : @xmath100\\ , , % % \\left [ 3 + \\frac{m^4_{h^\\pm}}{4m^2_w m^2_z}\\lambda(r_z , r_w ) \\right]\\ , , % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have dropped the light fermion masses , @xmath101 is used , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> besides the @xmath9 and @xmath66 modes , in the mass range ( ii ) one of vector bosons in the vector - boson pair channels becomes off - shell . </S>",
    "<S> although the contributions of the off - shell channels are small , we still express their partial decay rates as : @xmath106\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , since @xmath109 dictates the single charged higgs production cross section , in order to produce the @xmath50 bosons with sizable cross sections , the values of @xmath109 can not be too small . in order to understand the situation with large @xmath120 , we present the results with @xmath121 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the numerical analysis is done at the center of mass energy of @xmath18 tev . </S>",
