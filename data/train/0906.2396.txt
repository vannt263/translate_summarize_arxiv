    "the gauge / gravity duality , that relates strongly interacting gauge theories to theories of gravity in higher dimensions , has opened a new window to study many different strongly interacting systems .",
    "the applicability of this approach is very vast ranging from particle physics to plasma and nuclear physics . in ref .",
    "@xcite a model for a dual description of a superconductor was proposed .",
    "the model showed to have a critical temperature @xmath0 under which the system goes into a superconducting phase .",
    "the properties of this phase have been thoroughly studied @xcite , showing a resemblance with those of a type ii superconductor . in spite of this ,",
    "abrikosov vortices , known to happen in type ii superconductors , have not yet been obtained .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show that in this type of gravity duals vortex solutions indeed exist and can be energetically favorable in the presence of external magnetic fields . due to the nonlinear nature of these configurations",
    ", we will have to rely on numerical methods . among other physical properties",
    ", we will calculate the free energy and the range of the magnetic field @xmath1 at which the superconductor is at the intermediate phase ( shubnikov phase ) characterized by vortex configurations .",
    "further aspects of these solutions will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the physical system to study is a conformal strongly coupled superconductor in 3d at finite temperature and charge density .",
    "its gravitational dual theory @xcite is an asymptotically ads - schwarzschild space - time in 4d .",
    "the gravitational degrees of freedom are coupled to an u(1 ) gauge field @xmath2 and a complex scalar @xmath3 .",
    "the action that summarizes the above model is given by & & s = d^4x \\{(r+)- } , + & & = 14f^2+|d_|^2+||^2 .",
    "[ action ] @xmath4 is the 4d gravitational newton constant , the cosmological constant @xmath5 defines the asymptotic ads radius @xmath6 via the relation @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we use the convention where the metric @xmath9 has signature @xmath10 , with coordinates @xmath11 where @xmath12 is time , @xmath13 is the holographic direction such that the ads - boundary occurs at @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are polar coordinates parameterizing the remaining 2d plane . for the scalar mass @xmath16 we will focus on two possible values : @xmath17 .",
    "other values are expected to give similar behaviors @xcite .",
    "we will work in the so - called probe approximation , where the gravity sector is effectively decoupled from the matter sector and therefore , there is no back - reaction on the background metric due to @xmath18 .",
    "this regime is achieved in the limit of large @xmath19 , when compared to the gravitational strength . in this limit",
    "we can , without loss of generality , fix @xmath20 . in our conventions ,",
    "the background ads - schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) metric is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",

    "therefore , the holographic coordinate runs from the ads - boundary at @xmath14 to the bh horizon at @xmath25 .",
    "notice that we work with a planar bh with energy per unit area @xmath26 .",
    "then , the ads / cft duality tells us that the above are precisely the temperature and energy density of the dual superconductor .",
    "the gauge field has the usual ads - boundary behavior a_a_+j_z , where @xmath27 corresponds to the potentials on the dual cft , while @xmath28 plays the role of the conjugated currents .",
    "we will consider the case in which the charge density @xmath29 is fixed constant .",
    "the other potentials @xmath30 are related to turning on either electromagnetic fields or sample velocities in the dual cft , depending on the interpretation we give to the ads / cft duality .",
    "the first interpretation is what we will use in this article , while the second one is relevant for superfluids @xcite .",
    "similarly , the scalar field has the following ads - boundary behavior || az^3-+bz^ , [ psiads ] where @xmath31 ( for @xmath17 ) corresponds to the dimension of the dual operator @xmath32 responsible for the u(1 ) breaking , and @xmath33 determines the vacuum expectation value of this operator .",
    "the value of @xmath34 corresponds to an explicit breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry and will then be turned to zero .",
    "there is the possibility to have @xmath35 and @xmath36 corresponding to have a dual cft operator of dimension one @xcite . ]",
    "having fixed @xmath16 , the only parameters of the model are the scales @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that for @xmath39 the system undergoes a phase transition at t_c & & 0.12   for  m^2=-2 , + t_c & & 0.09   for  m^2=0 , where the two phases are related to a charged bh and a charged bh with a non - trivial scalar hair . at @xmath40 ,",
    "the system is at the hairy phase corresponding to a superconducting phase . in refs .",
    "@xcite the model was also studied in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath41 using a dyonic bh with a probe scalar field .",
    "the result was a bounded superconducting region or drop , that squeezes to zero size as we increase @xmath41 .",

    "if this is the case , abrikosov vortex configurations should be present in this model .",
    "we stress that , as is usual in this approach , we are treating the electromagnetic field of the 3d dual theory as a nondynamical background .",
    "this corresponds to take the 3d electric charge @xmath42 , while keeping constant @xmath41 and @xmath29 .",
    "we use the ansatz given by @xmath43 with all other fields set to zero .",
    "this ansatz preserves global u(1 ) transformations when combined with a rotation in the 2d plane .",
    "the fields @xmath44 can be consistently set to zero since our ansatz fulfills @xmath45=\\partial_z arg[\\psi]=0 $ ] .",
