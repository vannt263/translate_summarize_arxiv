    "numerous astronomical observations have led to the conclusion that the majority of the matter in our universe is invisible , exotic , and nonrelativistic dark matter @xcite . however , it is still unknown what the dark matter is . weakly interacting massive particles  ( wimps )",
    "are one of the most attractive dark matter particle candidates @xcite .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) hypothesized in theories beyond the standard model of particle physics is a suitable candidate for a dark matter wimp .",
    "there have been numerous experiments that directly search for wimps in our galaxy by looking for nuclear recoils that are produced by wimp ",
    "nucleus scattering  @xcite .    to date",
    ", no other experiments , except for the dama experiment  @xcite , have found an annual modulation signal interpreted as wimp interactions with a significance of 9.2@xmath2 .",
    "however , this finding has spurred a continuing debate since the wimp  nucleon cross sections inferred from the dama modulation are in conflict with limits from other experiments that directly measure the nuclear recoil signals , such as xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite , and supercdms  @xcite .",
    "the korea invisible mass search ( kims ) is an experiment that aims at searching for dark matter at an underground laboratory located in yangyang , south korea ( y2l ) .",
    "we are performing a high - sensitivity search for wimp interactions in an array of nai(tl ) crystals in an attempt to reproduce the dama / libra s observation of an annual modulation signal  @xcite .",
    "there are several groups , such as dm - ice  @xcite , anais  @xcite , and sabre  @xcite , developing ultra - low - background nai(tl ) crystals with the goal of reproducing the dama / libra results and currently , kims and dm - ice have agreed to operate a single experiment , cosine , at y2l using nai(tl ) crystals and a total mass of 106  kg is being used in the first - stage experiment , cosine-100 . as part of this program",
    "we have developed ultra - low - background nai(tl ) crystals and studied their properties in a variety of test setups with the ultimate goal of achieving purity levels that are comparable to or better than those of the dama / libra crystals .",
    "even though current background levels achieved by the research and development are higher than those of dama / libra , it is crucial to have a quantitative understanding of the backgrounds .    for further understanding of the backgrounds , we have performed monte carlo simulations based on geant4 and compared their results with measured data ( see sect .  [ comparison - data ]",
    ") . to build concrete background models , we studied background simulations of internal radioactive contaminants , such as natural radioisotopes inside nai(tl ) , cosmogenic radionuclei , and surface contaminations in nai(tl ) crystal ( see sect .",
    "[ cosmogenic - isotopes ] and  [ nai - surface ] ) , and external background sources from the exterior of crystals ( see sect .  [ external - background ] ) .",
    "we quantified their contributions by treating them as floating and/or constrained parameters in the data fitting ( see sect .",
    "[ fit ] ) .",
    "in addition , our evaluation of background prospects , based on this study , is described in section  [ conclusion ] .",

    "we have studied nai(tl ) crystal backgrounds based on monte carlo simulation using the geant4 toolkit .",
    "the studies show that all the simulated background spectra , normalized by measured activities and fitted fractions , describe the data well not only for single - hit events but also for multiple - hit events . according to the comparison between the monte carlo simulation and the data in the low - energy spectra",
    ", the background is found to be dominated by @xmath0pb , mainly surface @xmath0pb , which is due to @xmath3rn exposure during crystal growing and/or handling procedures , and @xmath1k within the nai(tl ) crystal , the background level of which is consistent with anais s expectation evaluated by assuming the activities of their characterized nai(tl ) crystals  @xcite .",
    "external background contributions are expected to be tagged by an active veto detector with a liquid scintillator ( ls ) surrounding crystals in the new detector design .",
    "we already observed such a reduction , @xmath4 in the 6 to 20-kev energy region , with a prototype active veto system using an ls  @xcite .",
    "an ls veto detector can also reduce the contribution of the internal @xmath1k background , by tagging 3-kev x - ray events with required conditions for the ls veto signal , by a factor of 2 with the optimized thickness of the ls in the new detector design  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we are studying the suppression of the @xmath0pb crystal - surface background to achieve a background level as low as bulk @xmath0pb , which contributes 0.04  dru in the 2 to 6-kev energy region .",
    "moreover , improving the purity of nai(tl ) crystals with small concentrations of @xmath0pb , @xmath560  @xmath6bq / kg , is possible , as reported in reference to kamland - pico  @xcite .    as a result",
    ", we are expecting that we can reach a background level of @xmath7  dru in the 2 to 6-kev energy region .",
