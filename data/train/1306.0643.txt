    "the existence of gaseous x - ray coronae around massive galaxies was first predicted by @xcite . following this work , galaxy formation simulations aimed to characterize such coronae @xcite .",
    "the continous advances in the implemented physics and applied methodology in the simulations led to major revisions in the predicted properties of the coronae .",
    "given the fundamental nature of these coronae and the disagreement between models , the observational characterization of luminous x - ray coronae offers a unique insight to probe the physical processes that influence galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "although hot gaseous coronae are ubiquitous for massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these coronae can not be used to probe structure formation models . on the one hand",
    ", the observed coronae around early - type galaxies may not originate from the accretion of primordial gas , but from the merger process and the corresponding starburst .",
    "on the other hand , massive early - type galaxies tend to lie in rich environments , and hence the coronal x - ray gas generally can not be distinguished from the larger - scale emission associated with the group / cluster .",
    "thus , galaxy formation models can be best tested by exploring hot x - ray coronae around massive spiral galaxies .",
    "the hunt for luminous x - ray coronae _ beyond _ the optical radii of massive spiral galaxies began with _",
    "rosat _ and continued with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , early studies failed to detect hot coronae around normal ( undisturbed and low star formation rate ) spirals , and only upper limits could be derived .",
    "recently , @xcite detected a luminous x - ray corona around ngc1961 , and @xcite found a hot corona around ugc12591 .",
    "they measured the spectrum of the integrated emission within 40 kpc for ngc1961 and 24 kpc for ugc12591 . while the resulting spectra were dominated by the x - ray emission associated with the galaxies , the integrated temperatures ( @xmath9 kev and @xmath10 kev ) were consistent with the expectations for a hot corona .",
    "in @xcite we derived the coronal temperatures and metallicities of ngc1961 and ngc6753 beyond their optical radii , specifically in the @xmath11 kpc and @xmath12 kpc range . in these regions ,",
    "the gas temperatures are @xmath13 kev for ngc1961 and @xmath14 kev for ngc6753 , which are independent of the x - ray emission associated with the stellar body of the galaxies .    at present only three non - starburst spiral galaxies",
    "are detected with luminous x - ray coronae .",
    "given the fundamental importance and the extreme rarity of these coronae , it is essential to identify other systems and explore the variations in coronal properties as a function of the host galaxy properties .",
    "characterizing the coronae in a broad sample of galaxies will place stringent constraints on galaxy formation models .",
    "= 5.8 cm = 5.8 cm = 5.8 cm    in this paper , we explore the extended x - ray emission associated with ngc266 , using _",
    "rosat _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observations .",
    "ngc266 is a massive spiral galaxy ( sb(rs)ab ) with a very modest star - formation rate ( @xmath15 ) , hence its coronal x - ray emission is not dominated by starburst driven winds ( sect . [ sec : ir ] ) .",
    "ngc266 is the dominant member of a poor group with six additional low - mass galaxies .",
    "the galaxy hosts a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) @xcite . for its distance",
    "we adopt @xmath16 mpc ( @xmath17 kpc ) .",
    "the galactic column density towards ngc266 is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "based on the stellar mass of the galaxy and using the results of galaxy formation simulations , the estimated virial mass of ngc266 is @xmath19 , hence its virial radius is @xmath20 kpc .",
    "_ rosat _ observed ngc266 in a pointed pspc observation on january 3 1992 for 23.4 ks .",
    "the data analysis was performed with standard ftools packages . throughout the analysis",
    ", we used the @xmath21 kev data , which offers substantial collecting area , but low instrumental background level .",
    "indeed , the bulk of the _ rosat _ background lies in the @xmath22 kev band , hence excluding this energy range significantly increases the signal - to - noise ratio for spectra that are not particularly soft .",
    "we emphasize that at energies @xmath23@xmath24 kev , no significant emission is expected from the hot x - ray gas due to the combined effects of the low effective area of _ rosat _ and the rather high galactic column density .    to study the diffuse emission , we identified and excluded bright point sources .",
    "the size of the point source regions were selected to excise @xmath25@xmath26 of the counts . to account for the x - ray emission associated with the llagn",
    ", we constructed the _ rosat _ pspc point spread function ( psf ) distribution using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the applied psf reconstruction is the convolution of five components , whose origin and importance is discussed in @xcite .",
    "according to the in - flight parametrization of the psf , the analytic psf distributions offer a robust description of bright point sources at all off - axis radii for energies @xmath27@xmath28 kev @xcite .    to precisely account for all ( instrumental and sky ) background components ,",
    "preferably local background regions should be used .",
    "therefore , we employed a circular annulus with @xmath29 radii around ngc266 . within this region",
    "no diffuse emission is detected from the galaxy , and the x - ray emission does not show significant radial variations , making this region suitable to calculate the background level . finally , we mention that the vignetting effects were also corrected using the exposure map provided for the specific observation .      ngc266 was observed by _",
    "chandra _ on june 1 2001 ( obs i d : 1610 ) for 2.0 ks by acis - s using a @xmath30 subarray configuration with the primary goal to study the llagn @xcite . due to the small image",
    "are , these data can not be used to explore the extended x - ray emitting components of the galaxy .",
    "we analyzed the data with standard ciao software package tools ( ciao version 4.5 ; caldb version 4.5.5.1 ) .",
    "the data was reprocessed with the _ chandra_repro _ task . to identify bright point sources",
    ", we ran the _ wavdetect _ tool .",
    "the source detection sensitivity of the observation is rather high , @xmath0@xmath31 , hence only one point source is resolved at the center of ngc266 , which is the llagn .",
    "= 8.7 cm = 8.7 cm      we used the k - band images of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) to trace the stellar light @xcite . since the 2mass k - band images of ngc266 are not background subtracted , we used nearby regions away from the galaxy to estimate the background level .",
    "bright foreground stars were visually identified and removed .",
    "we derive the total stellar mass of ngc266 from its k - band luminosity . to derive the k - band luminosity , we rely on the apparent 2mass k - band magnitude of the galaxy ( @xmath32 mag ) and use the absolute k - band magnitude of the sun ( @xmath33 mag ) .",
    "the k - band luminosity of ngc266 is @xmath34 .",
    "we convert this value to stellar mass using the k - band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath35 , which we compute from the results of galaxy evolution modeling @xcite and the @xmath36 color index .",
    "hence , the stellar mass of ngc266 is @xmath37 .",
    "the star - formation rate ( sfr ) of ngc266 is computed from the total infrared luminosity employing the @xcite relation . to derive the far - infrared fluxes",
    ", we follow the methodology of @xcite and rely on the @xmath38 m and @xmath39 m fluxes obtained by the _ infrared astronomical satellite_. from the far - infrared luminosity ( @xmath40 ) , we derive the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath41 ) using the conversion of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "hence , the sfr of ngc266 is @xmath43 , which is a rather low value given the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "in figure [ fig : images ] we depict an @xmath44 ( @xmath45 kpc ) region of ngc266 in near - infrared , optical , and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the 2mass k - band image traces the old stellar population , hence this image highlights the bulge of the galaxy . in the b - band optical image , taken from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) ,",
    "the spiral arms are prominent .",
    "the image also shows that ngc266 is seen approximately face - on .",
    "both the 2mass and dss images indicate the relaxed and undisturbed nature of the galaxy .",
    "the right panel shows the @xmath21 kev _ rosat _ image smoothed with a @xmath46 gaussian kernel .",
    "the x - ray image exhibits a bright central region and shows the presence of large - scale extended emission .",
    "this emission is more extended than the stellar light , which hints at the presence of a hot x - ray corona surrounding the galaxy .",
    "however , ngc266 hosts an llagn at its nucleus , whose emission could contribute to the observed diffuse emission due to the broad point spread function ( psf ) of _ rosat_. to assess the importance of the llagn in the extended emission , we quantitively investigate the x - ray and k - band surface brightness distribution of ngc266 .",

    "[ tab : values ]      to study the x - ray emission associated with ngc266 , we construct a surface brightness profile from the @xmath21 kev band _ rosat _ image .",
    "the profile is extracted from circular annuli centered on the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : profile ] shows the surface brightness profile , which reveals that the diffuse emission extends to at least @xmath48 ( @xmath49 kpc ) .",
    "note that the associated with the llagn is not excluded . to estimate the contribution of the llagn",
    ", we extract the _ rosat _ psf at @xmath50 kev and at @xmath51 off - axis , the approximate location of ngc266 .",
    "the particular energy choice does not influence our conclusions , since the _ rosat _ psf is only weakly dependent on the energy @xcite . according to the psf distribution",
    ", @xmath0@xmath26 of the source counts from the llagn should be within @xmath52 radius . to estimate the luminosity of the llagn , we use two approaches .",
    "first , we use the _ chandra _ data to derive the expected number of counts detected by _",
    "rosat_. with the @xmath53 ks _ chandra _ exposure we detect @xmath54 net counts in the @xmath55 kev band , which corresponds to @xmath56 _ rosat _ counts in the @xmath21 kev band , if we adopt a power law spectrum with slope of @xmath57 and galactic column density .",
    "this method assumes that the luminosity of the llagn did not vary between the two observations .",
    "however , the x - ray source could have been more luminous at the epoch of the _ rosat _ observation .",
    "hence as a second approach , we assume that all detected _ rosat _ counts within the central @xmath58 are associated with the llagn . under this extreme condition ,",
    "the point source was @xmath0@xmath59 times brighter , implying that @xmath60 _ rosat _ counts are associated with it . convolving the number of estimated source counts with the psf distribution , we show the estimated contribution of the llagn to the diffuse emission with shaded area in figure [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the profile demonstrates that beyond @xmath0@xmath61 ( @xmath0@xmath62 kpc ) , the contribution of the llagn does not play a major role .",
    "specifically , in the @xmath63 ( @xmath0@xmath64 kpc ) region no more than @xmath0@xmath65 of the detected counts are associated with the bright nuclear source .",
    "thus , the large - scale extended emission around ngc266 can not be explained by the llagn .",
    "moreover , the left panel of figure [ fig : profile ] demonstrates that the extended emission and the psf exhibit markedly different distributions , implying that the extended emission can not be merely attributed to the population of unresolved point sources associated with ngc266 .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : profile ] , we show the actual surface brightness profile of the diffuse x - ray emission . from this profile",
    "we subtracted the counts associated with the llagn , assuming that its luminosity did not change between the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations . to trace the stellar light",
    ", we extract the radial profile of the 2mass k - band image using the same annuli as for the x - ray profile .",
    "the k - band profile is normalized to match the level of x - ray emission in the innermost bin .",
    "as suggested by the images ( figure [ fig : images ] ) , the surface brightness profile demonstrates that the x - ray light associated with ngc266 extends well beyond the stellar light .",
    "while @xmath0@xmath66 of the k - band emission is confined to within @xmath61 ( @xmath0@xmath62 kpc ) , the diffuse x - ray emission extends to at least @xmath48 ( @xmath0@xmath1 kpc ) , implying that it is not associated with the x - ray emitting components of the stellar body .",
    "the radial distribution of the diffuse emission around ngc266 is similar to those obtained in the two other well - studied x - ray coronae in massive spirals @xcite . to further study the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission",
    ", we divided ngc266 into three azimuthal sectors with opening angles of @xmath67 .",
    "the azimuthal profiles in the different sectors agree with each other within statistical uncertainties , indicating that the extended emission has a fairly uniform distribution .",
    "however , due to the low number of source counts in the outer regions , followup observations are required to map the spatial distribution of the emission in detail .      to unveil the nature of the diffuse emission beyond the optical extent of ngc266 , it would be desirable to study its x - ray spectrum",
    ". however , in the @xmath63 region , _ rosat _ only detects @xmath0@xmath68 net counts , which are not sufficient for spectral analysis .",
    "therefore , we derive x - ray hardness ratios that could differentiate between the two potential origins of the emission : ( i ) hot gaseous x - ray corona in the dark matter halo of ngc266 , or ( ii ) a multitude of unresolved point sources , presumably originating from ( background ) agn . defining the hardness ratio ( @xmath69 )",
    "as the ratio of net counts @xmath70 , we expect very different hrs in the two scenarios . assuming a thermal spectrum with @xmath71 kev , a metallicity of @xmath72 solar , and galactic column density",
    ", we expect @xmath73 .",
    "note that such a spectrum was observed for the x - ray coronae of ngc1961 and ngc6753 @xcite .",
    "if ( background ) agn dominate , whose spectrum can be described with a power law model with slope of @xmath57 and galactic column density , we expect @xmath74 .    within the central @xmath52 region ,",
    "we obtain @xmath75 , which is in good agreement with a hard power law spectrum . indeed , the central region is dominated by the llagn , while the population of unresolved lmxb and hmxbs also plays a role .",
    "their spectra can be described with similar power law models . in the @xmath63 region , where the contribution of stellar light and the llagn is negligible , we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "this indicates that the emission most likely originates from a soft x - ray emitting component , and this value is consistent with a hot gaseous emission with a temperature less than @xmath77 kev .",
    "however , given the large statistical uncertainties , the contribution of a harder component , for example a population of unresolved cosmic x - ray background sources , can not be excluded .",
    "nevertheless , the x - ray hardness ratios indicate that the bulk of the diffuse emission beyond the stellar body of ngc266 is consistent with that from a gaseous x - ray corona .      measuring the properties of the hot x - ray gas in the dark matter halos of massive spirals",
    "can place major constraints on galaxy formation models , hence on the physical processes that influence galaxy evolution .",
    "to facilitate these efforts , we also derive the gas parameters for ngc266 .",
    "since accurate x - ray determinations of the temperature and metallicity are not feasible , we adopt gas parameters , which were measured for the hot x - ray coronae around ngc1961 and ngc6753 @xcite .",
    "namely , we assume a gas temperature of @xmath71 kev and a metallicity of @xmath72 solar .    we compute the gas parameters in the @xmath5 region , which corresponds to an annulus from @xmath78 ( @xmath0@xmath79 kpc ) . within this region",
    "we detect @xmath80 net counts after accounting for the emission associated with the llagn . in this computation we assumed that the luminosity of the llagn did not change between the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations . assuming the above - described thermal spectrum , the detected counts correspond to an absorbed @xmath81 kev luminosity of @xmath82 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the gas in the @xmath5 region is @xmath83 . using the volume from which the source flux is extracted and assuming that the emission can be described with a thermal plasma emission model ( apec in xspec )",
    ", we estimate that the mean electron density of the gas is @xmath84 . assuming a volume filling factor of unity and a constant gas density",
    ", the total gas mass is @xmath85 .",
    "the cooling time of the gas is estimated from @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the cooling function , and we obtain @xmath88 gyrs .",
    "these values are listed in table [ tab : values ] , where we also include the gas parameters derived for ngc1961 and ngc6753 .",
    "the comparison reveals that the gas parameters are similar in all three galaxies .",
    "following @xcite we investigate if starburst driven winds could be responsible for the observed extended emission around ngc266 . according to theoretical considerations , extraplanar x - ray emission driven by starburst winds",
    "is expected if the area specific supernova ( sn ) rate is @xmath25@xmath89 @xcite .",
    "we derive the sn rate from the total far - infrared luminosity @xmath90 @xcite , and obtain @xmath91 .",
    "based on this value and the size of the @xmath92 major axis diameter , the area specific sn rate of ngc266 is @xmath0@xmath93 , which falls short of the critical value . thus , ngc266 is unlikely to drive starburst winds at the present epoch .",
    "the detection of a luminous x - ray corona around ngc266 raises the question if other coronae could be detected based on archival _ rosat _ data . in principle ,",
    "further detections are feasible with _ rosat _ , provided that sufficiently deep pointed observations are available . however , in the local universe ( @xmath3@xmath94 mpc ) most massive normal spiral galaxies were only observed with the _ rosat _ all sky survey or with short pointed pspc observations , which data are not suitable for detailed analysis . therefore , to extend the sample of massive spirals with luminous coronae ,",
    "observations with present - day x - ray telescopes are indispensable .    while the present data demonstrate the presence of an extended x - ray emitting component around ngc266 , a moderately deep _",
    "observation could achieve the following goals : ( i ) conclusively determine the nature of the extended emission ; ( ii ) assess the x - ray luminosity of the llagn ; ( iii ) measure the gas temperature and metallicity , and hence derive accurate gas parameters ; ( iv ) build a precise radial profile , and hence estimate the total confined gas mass , and compute the baryon budget of the galaxy .",
    "ngc266 is the fourth spiral galaxy with a luminous x - ray corona detected beyond its optical radius .",
    "although the increasing number of detections is encouraging , the present sample does not yet allow us to draw general conclusions about the properties of x - ray coronae .",
    "the detected galaxies have a narrow range of stellar masses .",
    "therefore , it is essential to characterize the presently detected coronae in more detail and to explore further  preferably lower mass  galaxies . at present ,",
    "galaxy formation simulations are fairly mature , incorporating supernova and agn feedback , setting the stage to confront the observations with realistic simulations . such comparisons offer a unique possibility to constrain the physical processes , in particular the feedback effects , that play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies from high redshifts to the present - day universe .",
