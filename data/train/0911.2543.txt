    "chiral symmetry together with its spontaneous breaking is one of the key ingredients in the low - energy hadron or nuclear physics . due to its spontaneous",
    "breaking , up and down quarks , whose current masses are of the order of a few mev , acquire the large constituent masses of a few hundreds mev , and are consequently responsible for about 99% of mass of the nucleon and hence that of our world .",
    "one would thus consider that chiral condensate @xmath7 , the order parameter of the chiral phase transition , plays an essential role in the hadron - mass genesis in the light quark sector . on the other hand ,",
    "chiral symmetry gets restored in systems where hard external energy scales such as high - momentum transfer , temperature(@xmath8 ) , baryon density and so on exist , owing to the asymptotic freedom of qcd .",
    "then , several questions may arise : are all hadronic modes massless in such systems ? can hadrons be massive even without non - vanishing chiral condensate ?",
    "an interesting possibility was suggested some years ago by detar and kunihiro  @xcite , who showed that nucleons can be _ massive even without the help of chiral condensate _",
    "due to the possible _ chirally invariant mass terms _ , which give _ degenerated _ finite masses to the members in the chiral multiplet ( a nucleon and its parity partner ) even when chiral condensate is set to zero : in order to demonstrate this possibility for a finite-@xmath8 case , they introduced a linear sigma model which has a nontrivial chiral structure in the baryon sector and a mass - generation mechanism essentially different from that by the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "interestingly enough , their chiral doublet model has recently become a source of debate as a possible scenario of _ observed parity doubling in excited baryons _",
    "@xcite , although their original work @xcite was intended for an application to finite-@xmath8 systems .",
    "it is thus an intriguing problem to clarify the chiral structure of excited baryons in the light quark sector beyond model considerations .",
    "one of the key observables which are sensitive to the chiral structure of the baryon sector is axial charges  @xcite .",
    "the axial charge of a nucleon @xmath9 is encoded in the three - point function @xmath10 u.\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 is the isovector axial current .",
    "the axial charge @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 with the vanishing transferred momentum @xmath14 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the axial charge @xmath15 of @xmath16 is 1.26 .",
    "though the axial charges in the chiral broken phase can be freely adjusted with higher - dimensional possible terms and can not be the crucial clues for the chiral structure  @xcite , they would reflect the internal structure of baryons and would play an important role in the clarification of the low - energy hadron dynamics .    in this paper , we show the first unquenched lattice qcd study  @xcite of the axial charges @xmath0 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , two lowest nucleon resonances in the negative parity channel .",
    "we employ @xmath17 lattice with two flavors of dynamical quarks , generated by cp - pacs collaboration  @xcite with the renormalization - group improved gauge action and the mean - field improved clover quark action .",
    "we choose the gauge configurations at @xmath18 with the clover coefficient @xmath19 , whose lattice spacing @xmath20 is determined as 0.1555(17 ) fm .",
    "we perform measurements with 590 , 680 , and 680 gauge configurations with three different hopping parameters for sea and valence quarks , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which correspond to quark masses of @xmath23 150 , 100 , 65 mev and the related @xmath24-@xmath25 mass ratios are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "statistical errors are estimated by the jackknife method with the bin size of 10 configurations .",
    "our main concern is the axial charges of the negative - parity nucleon resonances @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath29channel .",
    "we then have to construct an optimal operator which dominantly couples to @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "we employ the following two independent nucleon fields , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in order to construct @xmath32 correlation matrices and to separate signals of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are dirac spinors for u- and d- quark , respectively , and @xmath35 denote the color indices . even after the successful signal separations , there still remain several signal contaminations : signal contaminations by _ scattering states _ and _ wraparound effects_.    due to the unquenched gauge configurations , the negative parity nucleon states could decay to @xmath24 and n , and their scattering states could inevitably get into the spectrum .",
    "the sum of the pion mass @xmath36 and the nucleon mass @xmath37 is however in our setups heavier than the masses of the lowest two states ( would - be @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in the negative parity channel .",
    "we then do not suffer from any scattering - state signals .",
    "the other possible contamination is wraparound effects  @xcite .",
    "since we perform unquenched calculations , the excited nucleon @xmath38 can decay into @xmath9 and @xmath24 , and even when we have no scattering state @xmath39 , we could have another type of `` scattering states '' .",
    "the baryonic correlator @xmath40 can still accommodate , for example , the following term .",
    "@xmath41 here , @xmath42 denotes the temporal extent of a lattice .",
    "such a term is quite problematic and mimic a fake plateau at @xmath43 in the effective mass plot because it behaves as @xmath44 . in order to eliminate such contributions",
    ", we impose the dirichlet condition on the temporal boundary for valence quarks , which prevents valence quarks from going over the boundary .",
    "( wraparound effects can be found even in quenched calculations  @xcite . )",
    "we employ zero - momentum - projected point - type operators for the sinks , and employ wall - type operators in the coulomb gauge for the sources .",
    "after we diagonalize the @xmath32 correlation matrices , we can construct optimized operators for n(1535 ) and n(1650 ) states .",
    "once we construct optimized operators , we can easily compute the ( non - renormalized ) vector and axial charges @xmath45}}$ ] for the positive- and negative - parity nucleons via three - point functions with the so - called sequential - source method  @xcite . in practice ,",

    "we first take a stock of the axial charge @xmath60 of the ground - state positive - parity nucleon , which is well known and can be the references . the axial charge @xmath60 of the positive parity nucleon is shown in fig .  [ axialvectorc ] as open squares .",
    "the axial charge of the positive parity nucleon shows little quark - mass dependence , and they lie around the experimental value 1.26 .",
    "we finally show the axial charges of the negative - parity nucleon resonances in fig .",
    "[ axialvectorc ] .",
    "one finds at a glance that the axial charge @xmath61 of @xmath1 takes quite small value , as @xmath62 and that even the sign is quark - mass dependent . while the wavy behavior might come from the sensitiveness of @xmath61 to quark masses",
    ", this behavior may indicate that @xmath61 is rather consistent with zero .",
    "these small values are not the consequence of the cancellation between u- and d - quark contributions .",
    "the u- and d - quark contributions to @xmath61 are in fact individually small  @xcite . on the other hand , the axial charge @xmath63 of @xmath2 is found to be about 0.55 , which has almost no quark - mass dependence .",
    "the striking feature is that these axial charges , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , are consistent with naive nonrelativistic quark model calculations  @xcite , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "such values are obtained if we assume that the wave functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath68 and @xmath69 neglecting the possible state mixing .",
    "( here , @xmath70 denotes the orbital angular momentum and @xmath71 the total spin . )    in the chiral doublet model  @xcite , the small @xmath0 is realized when the system is decoupled from the chiral condensate @xmath7 .",
    "the small @xmath61 of @xmath1 then does not contradict with the possible and attempting scenario , the _ chiral restoration scenario in excited hadrons _",
    "@xcite . if this scenario is the case , the origin of mass of @xmath1 ( or excited nucleons ) is essentially different from that of the positive - parity ground - state nucleon @xmath16 , which mainly arises from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the non - vanishing axial charge of @xmath2 unfortunately gives rise to doubts about the scenario .",
    "we have performed the first lattice qcd study of the axial charges @xmath0 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with two flavors of dynamical quarks employing the renormalization - group improved gauge action at @xmath3=1.95 and the mean - field improved clover quark action with the hopping parameters , @xmath4=0.1375 , 0.1390 and 0.1400 .",
    "we have found the small axial charge @xmath61 of @xmath1 , whose absolute value seems less than 0.2 and which is almost independent of quark mass , whereas the axial charge @xmath63 of @xmath2 is found to be about 0.55 .",
    "these values are consistent with naive nonrelativistic quark model predictions , and could not be the favorable evidences for the chiral restoration scenario in ( low - lying ) excited hadrons .",
    "further investigations on the axial charges of @xmath1 or other excited baryons will cast light on the chiral structure of the low - energy hadron dynamics and on where hadronic masses come from .",
    "all the numerical calculations were performed on nec sx-8r at rcnp and cmc , osaka university , on sx-8 at yitp , kyoto university , and on bluegene at kek .",
