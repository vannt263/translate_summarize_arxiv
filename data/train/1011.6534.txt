    "in this talk , i will discuss the npdfs which are obtained through genuinely global analyses , which are based on the dglap evolution @xcite and where one uses various types of nuclear hard process data in extracting the npdfs .",
    "such analyses are a test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and collinear factorization , schematically expressed as @xmath5 where the factorization / renormalization scales are sufficiently large , @xmath6 , and the pdfs @xmath7 are universal and transferable from one hard process to another .",
    "traditionally , both for the free and bound proton pdfs , the global dglap analysis procedure has been as follows : one starts with the non - perturbative input , an initial assumption , for the pdfs @xmath8 , which are expressed in terms of a set of fit parameters @xmath9 and where the initial scale @xmath10 typically is of the order of 1 gev .",
    "qcd sum rules are imposed at this stage .",
    "the pdfs at larger scales , @xmath11 , are obtained through the standard pqcd dglap evolution to the required order ( lo , nlo , ... ) . after this , one compares the various hard - process cross sections , which are computed using the set @xmath12 , with existing data .",
    "the best set of pdfs is determined through iteration in the @xmath13-parameter space , by finding the set @xmath9 which minimizes the @xmath14 of the fit .",
    "after this , one has to perform a rather non - trivial error analysis to determine the non - correlated `` error pdf sets '' which allow one to study the propagation of the npdf - uncertainties into hard cross sections .",
    "thus , the outcome of such global analysis is the best pdf set @xmath15 , supplemented with a number of error sets .    here i will not be addressing the qcd origin of the nuclear effects in pdfs  for discussion on this important question see e.g. refs .",
    "i will focus on the linear dglap evolution only , studies of other evolution equations ( bfkl , bk , ... ) , saturation or nonlinear effects @xcite will not be addressed here either . as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) , power corrections ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) will be ignored also .",
    "the global analyses of pdfs and npdfs are quite challenging , since in general the data lie in correlated regions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and since there are statistical , systematic and also additional normalization errors to deal with but no unique way of propagating these uncertainties into the pdfs .",
    "as the parameter space is 1530 dimensional , _ very _ fast dglap and cross - section solvers are needed especially in the nlo ( for technical details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the global dglap analyses have resulted in excellent fits for collinearly factorized free proton pdfs : sets like ct10 @xcite , mstw @xcite , and ( from neural networks ) nnpdf2.0 @xcite are nowadays available . the global analysis of npdfs , however , is even more challenging than that of the free proton pdfs , since in addition to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 dependence one needs to consider also the @xmath18 dependence of the pdfs .",
    "there also is a smaller amount of data from fewer types of processes available as constraints , and the kinematical coverage of the nuclear hard - process data is more limited than in the free proton pdf case .",
    "genuinely global analyses of npdfs have been performed now over a decade .",
    "the pioneering lo analysis , where the @xmath14 minimization was made by eye , resulted in the npdf set eks98 @xcite , which still is valid and useful .",
    "the first error estimates on npdfs were provided for the lo sets hkm @xcite and hkn04 @xcite .",
    "the first nlo npdfs were given in the nds set @xcite and the first error estimates in the nlo case in the hkn07 set @xcite .",
    "the latest progress was made in the eps09 analysis @xcite which includes rhic data and now for the first time provides , in addition to the best nlo fit , 30 concrete npdf error sets ( for each @xmath18 ) . with eps09 , which currently represent the state - of - the - art nlo npdfs , one has reached the same degree of technical rigor in the global analysis for npdfs as achieved already some time ago in the free proton case .",
    "let me next describe the main features in the eps09 analysis framework , for details , see the ref .",
    "we define the bound proton pdfs relative to the free proton ones , taking the set cteq6.1 m @xcite as our baseline : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the parton flavour . choosing cteq6.1",
    "m means that we work in the @xmath21 and zero - mass variable flavor - number schemes .",
    "isospin symmetry is assumed , so that the average @xmath22-quark distribution in a nucleus @xmath18 becomes @xmath23 , and similarly for the @xmath24-quark and @xmath25 antiquarks .    as illustrated in fig .  1 ( left ) , one has to deal with the following @xmath16- , @xmath17- and @xmath18-dependent nuclear effects in the npdfs : the `` shadowing '' depletion observed in the dis structure function ratios @xmath26 at @xmath27 , the `` antishadowing '' excess around @xmath28 , the `` emc - effect '' depletion at @xmath29 and the `` fermi motion '' excess towards @xmath30 and beyond",
    ". these effects are in the npdfs at our ( cteq6.1 m s ) initial scale @xmath31  gev@xmath32 . in the lack of sufficient data constraints , we are forced to start with only three different modification ratios : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for gluons , valence quarks and sea quarks , correspondingly .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence is embedded in the @xmath18 dependence of the parameters , such as the one controlling the antishadowing : @xmath36 , with carbon as the reference nucleus .",
    "the small nuclear effects in deuterium are neglected .    in the eps09 analysis",
    ", we have altogether 929 data points from 32 different data sets at our disposal . three types of data are used : deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering ( dis ) , drell - yan ( dy ) dimuon production in p+@xmath18 collisions from fnal , and most lately  and included so far only in eps08 ( lo ) @xcite and in eps09 ( nlo , lo ) @xcite  also neutral - pion production at mid - rapidity in @xmath24+au collisions from bnl - rhic . note that unlike in eps08 , we do not utilize the brahms forward - rapidity hadron data from d+au in the eps09 analysis .    the goodness measure @xmath14 , which is minimized as described in sec .",

    "this standard weighting procedure does not cause a bias as long as no significant tension between different data sets arises .",
    "the multiplier @xmath40 , which minimizes the @xmath41 for a data set @xmath42 at every round of iteration ( needed only for the rhic data now ) , is an output of the analysis , giving the best estimate of the overall normalization which is still consistent with the error @xmath43 provided by the experiment .     and the role of certain fit parameters . *",

    "is determined , we perform an error analysis using the hessian method . first , to find those linear combinations of @xmath13 which are uncorrelated , we diagonalize the hessian matrix * h * , whose elements are the second derivatives of @xmath14 at @xmath50 . then , denoting by @xmath45 the suitably normalized parameter eigendirections , we can expand the @xmath14 as follows : @xmath51 after this , the error propagation becomes more straightforward and we can obtain the error for a physical npdf - dependent quantity @xmath52 through the variations of the uncorrelated parameters @xmath45 as ( for details , see @xcite ) , @xmath53 where we have taken the same increase , @xmath54 , in each eigendirection @xmath20 of * h*. figure [ fig : chi2 ] ( right ) shows that the quadratic approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadraticapprox ] ) above is working well sufficiently near the @xmath14 minimum .",
    "no unique procedure , however , exists for obtaining @xmath55 .",
    "we use the `` 90% confidence criterion '' originally developed by cteq @xcite , and explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "the idea , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] ( bottom ) , is as follows : the @xmath14 minimum for each data set of @xmath39 data points is first determined separately for each eigendirection @xmath20 .",
    "then , we let the parameter @xmath45 grow(decrease ) from the extremum location up(down ) to the point that the @xmath14 of this data sets reaches the value below which the @xmath14 should reside within a 90% probability , if an @xmath39-dimensional gaussian probability distribution for the @xmath14 is assumed . repeating this procedure for all the data sets , and in the end taking the stringest of",
    "all the obtained upper / lower limits , @xmath56 for each data set , and averaging over all eigendirections @xmath20 , we arrive at @xmath57 whether @xmath58 above reproduces the average size of the actual error bars in the data , needs of course be checked a posteriori . from fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] ( right ) , however , we see that for this choice of @xmath59 , the quadratic approximation is still fine .",
    "thus , the eps09 npdf package contains the central set ( best fit ) @xmath60 and 15 + 15 error sets @xmath61 , which are obtained by changing the fit parameters along the plus and minus directions of @xmath45 so that the global @xmath14 grows by 50 .",
    "since the error sets @xmath61 may shift a physical quantity @xmath52 which the user wishes to study , into the same direction , we recommend the following prescription @xcite for computing the upper and lower limits of @xmath52 : @xmath62 ^ 2,\\nonumber\\\\   ( \\delta x^-)^2   & \\approx & \\sum_i \\left [ \\max\\left\\ { x(s^0)-x(s^+_i ) , x(s^0)-x(s^-_i),0 \\right\\ } \\right]^2 .",

    "further tests of factorization and npdfs will be provided e.g. by rhic data for direct photons in d+au , and both rhic and lhc data in au+au collisions .",
    "the corresponding pqcd cross sections have been discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also eps09nlo - related direct photon studies both for rhic and lhc have been launched @xcite . to constrain the nuclear quark distributions better ,",

    "further tests of factorization will also be given by heavy - quark production and forward - rapidity pion data in d+au collisions at rhic . to properly test the applicability of factorization at the available highest energies as well  and to get the most reliable comparison baselines for the nuclear hard processes",

    "finally , regarding a longer - term outlook for the global analyses , in order to obtain a minimal number of uncorrelated error sets simultaneously for the free - proton pdfs and for the npdfs , one should eventually combine the global analyses for the free and bound proton pdfs into one single master analysis .",
