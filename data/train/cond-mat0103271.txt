    "[ fig2]b we need in addition the @xmath105 and @xmath59patterns displayed in figs .",

    "[ fig2]b[fig2]d one can easily see that inside a domain we have @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , the well  known two types of antiphase boundaries @xcite are recovered .",
    "for example , boundaries where @xmath99 and @xmath59 simultaneously change sign in the @xmath31direction are the `` low  energy '' ( type1 ) domain walls and in fact cost no energy in our nearest  neighbor model .",
    "these walls are almost completely flat and turn out to be rather stable . on the other hand , boundaries where @xmath99 and @xmath59 simultaneously change sign in the @xmath30direction are `` high  energy '' ( type2 ) walls where curvature  driven coarsening is much more effective than for type1 walls .",

    "let us close this section by a brief remark on the distribution of vacancies in our system with free surfaces .",
    "first of all , vacancies tend to enrich in the outermost layers .",
    "for example at @xmath119 we find a surface vacancy concentration of about @xmath120 , much larger than the overall concentration .",
    "the fact that vacancies are expelled from the bulk suggests that in fact we are dealing with a model for a stable solid which , when regarding the complete ternary ( @xmath21)system , would be phase  separated from the `` vacuum '' ( vacancy  rich ) phase .",
    "furthermore , when analyzing the above  mentioned layered structure along the @xmath32axis caused by surface segregation , we find that vacancies deplete in the @xmath22layers and enrich in the @xmath15layers .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath71 repulsive energy in @xmath22layers becomes minimized when vacancies avoid @xmath16sites .",
    "the resulting oscillations in the vacancy ",
    "density along the @xmath32axis have an amplitude of about @xmath121 percent relative to the average vacancy density .",
    "now we turn to the question of how order evolves in a system with free surfaces .",
    "quench conditions are chosen as in section 3 with final temperatures below @xmath9 but in the vicinity of @xmath26 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "first , within few mc  steps @xmath16atoms enrich in the surface layer to a concentration of about @xmath73 and deplete in the adjacent layer , thereby establishing local equilibrium as enforced by the surface field @xmath86 .",
    "this implies @xmath123 to about @xmath124 at @xmath125 in the temperature interval considered .",
    "this process in turn induces moves of @xmath16atoms from even to odd layers within an increasing depth from the surface , thus forming a @xmath59front which penetrates into the bulk . as an example",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the @xmath59distribution in a section parallel to the ( @xmath126)plane at @xmath127 for three different times after the quench .",
    "the patterns clearly demonstrate a systematic progression of an ordered state with fixed ( positive ) sign of @xmath59 . taking averages over sheets parallel to the surface",
    ", we obtain profiles @xmath128 which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    at @xmath129 a plateau region for smaller",
    "@xmath32 has evolved with @xmath59values in the vicinity of the equilibrium order parameter @xmath130 at that temperature , before the profile decays to zero for larger @xmath32 .",
    "evidently , the thickness of the interface between the partially ordered state and the bulk ( not penetrated by the @xmath59front ) increases with time , an effect expected to arise both from growing intrinsic capillary wave fluctuations @xcite and from bulk fluctuations in all three order parameter components with the character as in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , to be `` incorporated '' into the front during propagation .",
    "+    the profiles @xmath128 allow us to define a time ",
    "dependent penetration depth @xmath131 by setting @xmath132 .",
    "plots of @xmath131 for a series of final temperatures @xmath23 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a for a system large enough in the @xmath32direction ( @xmath133 ) to avoid the @xmath59fronts induced by both surfaces to overlap .",
    "( in fact , data in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] contain an average over those two fronts . ) as expected , after a quench not passing the phase boundary @xmath131 rapidly saturates .",
    "for example , at @xmath134 the final penetration depth is about 6 atomic layers , which is of the order of the bulk correlation length @xmath135 in the disordered phase at that temperature . on the other hand , when @xmath24 , we see that after a short transient @xmath131 grows more or less linearly with time within an extended time interval .",
    "this allows us to introduce a penetration velocity @xmath136 which increases upon lowering the temperature .",
    "for example , at @xmath137 we find that @xmath131 grows linearly up to at least @xmath138 mcs , where it reaches about @xmath139 atomic layers , see also fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in determining @xmath136 ,",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , care has to be taken with respect to the lateral size @xmath140 of the system . for small @xmath140",
    "the system is likely to develop single ( closed ) domains in the lateral direction within the front region .",
    "increased order of this type will speed up the penetration process .",
    "this @xmath140dependence of @xmath141 is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b for @xmath137 .",
    "data up to @xmath129 mcs , however , seem to converge sufficiently at our largest @xmath142 . moreover , using again @xmath143 , we have also tested the influence of the vacancy concentration on @xmath141 . at @xmath137 ,",
    "results with @xmath144 ( @xmath145 vacancies ) are indistinguishable from those shown in the figure .",
    "hence the vacancy system appears to be in the dilute limit also with respect to growth processes of this type .",
    "note that for @xmath4 the experimental vacancy concentration at @xmath9 is even lower.@xcite    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , when temperature is decreased from @xmath9 , the velocity @xmath146 first increases with upward curvature , but decelerates when @xmath147 .",
    "sufficiently below @xmath26 , linear growth can no longer be identified and @xmath136 becomes undefined , see the case @xmath148 in fig .",
    "some estimates based on mean  field arguments concerning the order of magnitude of @xmath136 are presented in the appendix .",
    "when temperature falls near or below @xmath149 , a new regime of slower growth beyond some crossover time @xmath25 becomes detectable within the time window of fig .",
    "@xmath25 decreases with temperature , so that the regime of linear growth shrinks .",
    "notice in addition the non  monotonous behavior of @xmath131 as a function of temperature for fixed observation time @xmath150 . as indicated",
    "already , the strong shrinkage of the linear regime , where @xmath25 tends to merge with the short time transient , occurs at temperatures slightly below but very near the spinodal temperature @xmath151 discussed in section 3 on the basis of static considerations . regarding these surface phenomena",
    "we conclude that the spinodal temperature as estimated via the static segregation profiles separates two distinct dynamical regimes , roughly characterized by the presence or the absence of surface  induced linear ( constant velocity ) growth in an intermediate time domain .",
    "the slowing down of the front motion beyond the linear regime , i.e. for @xmath152 , clearly originates from its competition with nearly saturated domains that have already nucleated in the bulk . crudely speaking ,",
    "@xmath25 will be determined by the interplay of two dynamic quantities , the penetration velocity @xmath136 and the nucleation rate of ordered domains . moreover ,",
    "unstable growth of bulk domains at temperatures @xmath2 totally suppresses the linear regime .",
    "to investigate this situation more closely , we carried out even longer runs up to @xmath153 for the case @xmath148 .",
    "results at that temperature for @xmath131 in a log  log representation are shown in fig .",
    "the data in the range @xmath154 mcs appear to follow a power ",
    "law @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "the appearance of such small growth exponent is confirmed by additional simulations at a temperature @xmath157 considerably below @xmath26 , also shown in fig .",
    "these data indicate in addition that the onset of this type of power law is moved to earlier times when temperature is lowered .",
    "conversely , data for @xmath104 display a crossover to a slow temporal growth compatible with @xmath158 at a larger crossover time , indicated as @xmath25 in fig .",
    "since the penetration depth up to @xmath153 stays significantly smaller than the system size ( in this case @xmath159 ) , we expect that finite size effects do not play an essential role in estimating that exponent @xmath34 .",
    "preliminary results for the structure factor of a bulk system seem to confirm that value of @xmath34 , although no definitive conclusions concerning the asymptotic long  time behavior can be drawn from these studies so far .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to compare our findings in fig .",
    "[ fig6]c with recent work by castn and lindgrd.@xcite these authors studied coarsening processes in a @xmath160dimensional system involving both curved and flat ( zero curvature ) domain walls .",
    "the latter were essentially immobile and could be removed only by the progression of an intervening curved wall .",
    "such a situation basically is encountered also in the present model , where type1 antiphase boundaries turn out to be essentially immobile .",
    "this stability of flat walls induces an overall growth exponent which is smaller than the classical lifschitz ",
    "cahn exponent @xmath107.@xcite castn in fact gave arguments in favor of an exponent @xmath161 .",
    "a similar conclusion with respect to @xmath34 was reached by deymier et al.@xcite from studies of a different model with two types of contacts between domains .",
    "next we study lateral ordering within layers parallel to the ( @xmath103)plane at a depth @xmath32 from the surface .",
    "this process proceeds in different ways depending on whether @xmath162 or @xmath163 .",
    "when analyzing the layer @xmath164 midway between the two surfaces , representative for the latter case , we recover the characteristics of bulk ordering as described briefly in section 3 , see also fig .",
    "our main objective , however , is the near  surface region @xmath162 and consequences of the surface  induced segregation wave . as emphasized before,@xcite for @xmath162 the sign of @xmath59 is essentially fixed to @xmath165 so that only two types of domains can appear : @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "these correspond to the two ways @xmath16atoms can form a @xmath168superstructure on the square lattice building an odd ( @xmath22type ) layer .",
    "walls between those domains encountered when going in the lateral direction are exclusively of type 2 , whereas type1 walls are parallel to the surface .",

    "a second important conclusion confirmed by our simulations is the existence of an anisotropic domain structure in the near  surface region @xmath162 .",
    "only two types of domains and , for @xmath32 fixed , only high  energy domain walls appear , as opposed to the well  known domain structure in the bulk with @xmath8 types of domains and both high and low ",
    "energy walls in either direction . since in @xmath4 @xmath131 can become larger than @xmath183@xcite or about @xmath184 atomic layers ( in our simulations more than @xmath139 atomic layers ) this should offer the possibility to grow films of mesoscopic thickness with an anisotropic domain structure not realized in the bulk . an interesting question for future work concerns films with odd and even numbers of atomic layers and overlapping @xmath59fronts induced by both surfaces .",
    "moreover , our present studies exemplify different ordering scenarios that may emerge more generally in systems whose bulk structure requires a multicomponent order parameter , and where the surface favors some kind of partial ordering .",
    "concerning domain growth in our model , we have to distinguish between perpendicular and lateral growth modes , between a near  surface partially ordered region ( @xmath162 ) and the bulk region ( @xmath163 ) , and between quench temperatures @xmath23 above and below the spinodal temperature @xmath26 .",
    "at least three distinct coarsening schemes at intermediate or long times were observed . if @xmath24 , perpendicular order initially grows linearly with @xmath150 such that @xmath185 for @xmath186 , while for @xmath152 our data indicate a temporal regime where @xmath187 . on the other hand , for @xmath2 the regime of linear perpendicular growth",
    "is suppressed .",
    "analysis of the typical domain structure in the lateral direction shows that in the region @xmath162 it is isotropic and coarsens according to @xmath188 at long times ( @xmath189 ) while for @xmath163 one recovers bulk behavior .    besides some open questions addressed already above we like to point out that non - stoichiometric alloys should in principle display even more rich and interesting behaviors , in particular in cases where ordering and phase separation occur simultaneously.@xcite",
    "the authors are indebted to h. reichert for several discussions concerning the experimental situation and to p. maass for helpful comments . a useful conversation with m. maret ,",
    "m. albrecht and g. schatz about surface segregation effects in the fcc alloy @xmath190 is also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this work was supported in part by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , sfb 513 .",
    "we attempt here to give some qualitative estimates concerning the magnitude of the penetration velocity @xmath136 , see section 4 , from simplified mean  field considerations .",
    "our starting point are time ",
    "dependent ginzburg ",
    "landau equations , based on the free energy density @xmath191 as given by lai @xcite for the @xmath4 structure , @xmath192 with @xmath193 . the ordering temperature @xmath9 is determined by @xmath194 and the order parameter at @xmath9 has the magnitude @xmath195 with @xmath196 .",
    "regarding the penetration of the segregation wave as a one  dimensional process along the @xmath32axis ( perpendicular to the surface ) , we assume an equation of motion for @xmath128 of the form @xmath197 with a kinetic coefficient @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "two limiting cases concerning the coupling of @xmath59 with @xmath99 and @xmath105 can be considered such that ( [ pt ] ) becomes a closed equation for @xmath59 only .",
    "thereby it turns out that the simulated velocity falls between these two limits .",
    "first , if the parameters are such that the evolution of lateral order , expressed by @xmath99 and @xmath105 , considerably lags behind the progression of the @xmath59front , one may set in ( [ pt ] ) @xmath200 . in this case , the form ( [ f ] ) of the free energy density allows a nontrivial solution for a propagating front only at temperatures @xmath201 , with a velocity of propagation @xmath202.@xcite correspondingly , we obtain @xmath203 for @xmath204 , contrary to fig .",
    "however , simulations of our nearest  neighbor interaction model indicate that lateral order at least on small length scales evolves almost simultaneously with the front motion in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this suggests to consider a second , in fact opposite limit , namely that @xmath99 and @xmath105 instantaneously relax towards the `` local equilibrium condition '' @xmath205 .",
    "this yields the approximation @xmath206 , to be used in ( [ pt ] ) . introducing @xmath207 and the `` potential '' @xmath208 we obtain @xmath209 where @xmath210 denotes the correlation length at @xmath9 .",
    "the ansatz @xmath211 leads to an ordinary differential equation for @xmath212 .",
    "the velocity @xmath141 is determined in the usual manner @xcite by requiring that appropriate boundary conditions can be fulfilled .",
    "these are @xmath213 ; @xmath214 as @xmath215 , where @xmath216 corresponds to the absolute maximum of @xmath217 and @xmath218 ; @xmath214 as @xmath219 . numerical solution of this problem shows that , at @xmath9 , @xmath136 starts to grow linearly in @xmath220 and that @xmath221 . to estimate @xmath198",
    ", one can formulate mean  field arguments for the diffusion of the slower atomic species , in this case the @xmath16atoms , along the @xmath32axis , which yields @xmath222 .",
    "using @xmath223 , this gives the relation @xmath224 , independent of the monte carlo time unit . from the simulated value @xmath225 at @xmath9 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we obtain @xmath226 . comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows that these simple arguments overestimate the velocity at @xmath26 by about one order of magnitude .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the simplifications made , especially in view of the neglect of lateral fluctuations .",
    "these may strongly reduce the penetration velocity , an effect already inferred from the @xmath140dependence of the velocity displayed in fig .",
