    "the two - body potential of @xmath0-particle long - range interacting systems decays asymptotically as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inter particle distance , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the dimension of the embedding space  @xcite .",

    "the dynamical properties of systems with long - range interactions are also peculiar . for such systems ,",

    ", one observes a relaxation towards out - of - equilibrium stationary states .",
    "there are many such stationary states , that are obtained by varying the initial condition .",
    "they have been called quasi stationary states ( qsss )  @xcite , because for all finite @xmath0 they display a slower  collisional \" evolution towards equilibrium on a time scale of the order @xmath7 . on a short time scale",
    ", the time evolution of the single - particle distribution function in phase - space is well described by the vlasov equation  @xcite , with corrections of order @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this equation has an infinity of stationary solutions , the stable ones can give rise to qsss .    an interesting question , which has been recently investigated  @xcite , concerns the response of a qss to a stimulus .",
    "this question can be explored by studying how a stationary stable state of the vlasov equation reacts to a perturbation .",
    "this latter can be of different types and origins .",
    "a first type of perturbation may come from a generic variation of the single - particle distribution function with respect to a stationary stable one .",
    "typically , this variation vanishes with time due to landau damping  @xcite .",
    "a second type of perturbation consists in applying externally a stochastic noise  @xcite : these perturbations generically bring the system towards an equilibrium or non equilibrium steady state , depending on whether detailed balance is respected or not , on a time - scale which depends on the strength of the noise .",
    "a third , and final , kind of perturbation consists in adding an external field to the dynamics .",
    "this latter is the perturbation considered in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of linear response theory for homogeneous states .",
    "an extension of this approach to non homogeneous states  @xcite , based on integrability , has led to a characterization of linear response in a more general framework .",
    "this latter work is based on previous studies of the solutions of the linearized vlasov equation around inhomogeneous states  @xcite .",
    "integrability is guaranteed for one - dimensional systems when the unperturbed state is stationary and is present also for a few other hamiltonians in higher dimensions .",
    "integrability is implemented by an action - angle transformation , which conveniently separates the phase - space variables .    in this paper",
    ", we consider perturbations of the dynamics obtained by the addition of a conservative external field . as in previous work  @xcite",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the study of small perturbations within linear response theory . however",
    ", we do not use integrability as a necessary requirement to derive the linear response formula .",
    "this choice has a drawback , since integrals of motion have then to be imposed by hand in order to obtain the correct result .",
    "the vlasov equation has an infinity of conserved quantities besides those related to symmetries , the so - called casimirs  @xcite .",
    "since we are unable to impose this infinity of constraints , we restrict ourselves to consider a finite number of them ( e.g. normalization of the single - particle distribution ) and , therefore , derive an approximate response formula .",
    "the advantage of this approach with respect to previous ones is that our response formula can be derived in general also for non integrable systems .",
    "moreover , our method allows us to consider many different unperturbed states , both homogeneous and inhomogeneous .    in order to illustrate the validity of our approach we explicitly derive the response to an externally applied field for the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model  @xcite , a paradigmatic mean - field system",
    "this allows us to compare our approximate formula with the exact one derived in ref .",
    "we obtain a good agreement excluding a region of energy close to the second - order phase transition of the model , where the response diverges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ vlasovequation ]",
    "we introduce the vlasov equation and its linearization . in the following section  [ sec4:variationhamiltonian ] we derive the linear response formula .",
    "its time asymptotics is studied in section  [ sec4:asymptotics ] .",

    ", we demonstrate the agreement of our predictions with numerical simulations realized for different unperturbed states of the hmf model .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we recall in this section some basic features of the vlasov equation and of its linearization . moreover , we formally derive the expression of the response to a perturbation in a slightly different way as done in ref .",

    "these conjugate variables must be interpreted as eulerian variables describing a point in phase - space rather than as dynamical variables .",

    ", one can check that in the limit @xmath33 the unperturbed solution is recovered .",
    "we will denote all the unperturbed quantities with the subscript zero , e.g. @xmath34 .",
    "the perturbed distribution function can be developed in two different ways @xmath35 the first development is strictly valid only for instantaneous variations of the external field . for smooth variations",

    "in deriving the last equation , we have set to zero the initial variation of the distribution @xmath46 since the external perturbation vanishes at @xmath30 .",

    "the linear vlasov equation can be solved for stationary homogeneous distributions using laplace transform in time and fourier transform in space @xmath11  @xcite . applying these well - known methods , some authors @xcite derived explicit analytical formulas for the variation of a generic observable @xmath16 under the application of an external perturbation .",
    "these derivations are based on the analogy between the vlasov equation and the liouville equation .",

    "we will discuss in the following cases in which the system relaxes asymptotically to a stationary state and , therefore , time translation invariance is restored in this limit . however , there are initial conditions for which the system sets into a stable macroscopically oscillating state , thus violating time translation invariance for all times .",
    "we believe that the presence of such oscillatory states is a typical behavior of mean - field systems : it is indeed due to the self - consistent interaction of the single particle with the mean - field potential  @xcite .",
    "we have up to now presented in some detail the basic equations which will allow us to derive , at linear order , the response of the system to a small external perturbation .",
    "we will discuss in the following sections how the calculation of the variation of a generic observable can be performed explicitly for a wide class of models and of initial conditions .",
    "however , before moving to this derivation , we would like first to discuss the role of the constraints on the dynamics imposed by global conservation laws .",

    "for instance , at equilibrium the inverse energy is equal to the inverse temperature , times some constant .",

    "therefore , zeros of @xmath83 characterize the long - time behavior of @xmath84 , after performing an inverse laplace transform , as we will discuss in detail in the following section .",

    "furthermore , we obtain a stability criterion because the geometric series can be computed only when @xmath86 . on the contrary , when the eigenvalue is larger than one in modulus the state is unstable and linear theory can not be used .",
    "we remark that integral equations can also be solved using fredholm determinants  @xcite , but in this case the solution is more involved , since the kernel of the integral is itself a non - trivial operator .",

    "we will here restrict to discuss those constraints that play a relevant role in the derivation of our response theory .",
    "the first constraint derives from mass conservation , which is a consequence of considering a closed system . however , our system can exchange energy with the environment , hence we can evaluate the work done on the system by the external perturbation .",
    "the entailed generalized energy conservation relation imposes , as we will see , a constraint on the dynamics .",

    "they all take the form @xmath110 , with @xmath111 a smooth function .",
    "for instance , mass is one of such casimirs .",

    "the mass of the system is given by @xmath112 at first order in the size of the perturbation @xmath32 we get @xmath113 for a closed system , mass is conserved @xmath114 , hence @xmath115 in the following we will set the total mass to one , @xmath116 .",
    "the system is perturbed by an external field , hence the total energy @xmath117(x , v , t)f(x , v , t)dxdv\\\\      \\mathrm{e}[f](q , p , t)&=&\\frac{p^2}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\phi[f](q , t)+hb(q , t)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is not a conserved quantity .",
    "however , since the time evolution of the distribution function is determined by the full perturbed hamiltonian ( the external forces are conservative ) , the variation of the total energy is equal to the work @xmath118 done by the external forces on the system @xmath119 where @xmath120 this is a generalized energy conservation law , as obtained in mechanics .",
