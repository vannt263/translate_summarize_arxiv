    "with the completion of a long stare at its original field , a host of new astrophysical information is available on the star clusters observed during the original _ kepler _  mission .",
    "variable stars of many different types were discovered and studied thanks to the high - precision photometry and the nearly total coverage of the cycles of even long - period variables .",
    "one of the challenges in the aftermath of the _ kepler _  mission continues to be the synthesis of information derived from large samples of stars .",
    "our focus in this paper is the sample of stars from one of the open star clusters in the original _ kepler _  field .",
    "the brightest stars of the open cluster ngc 6811 comprise a rich set of objects with astrophysical information that has not yet been fully exploited . on the cool side , there are a group of helium - burning red clump and asymptotic giant stars with solar - like oscillations previously detected with the _ kepler _  spacecraft @xcite . on the hot side ,",
    "the bright end of the main sequence fits neatly within the instability strip , and @xmath12 scuti ( sct ) and @xmath1 doradus ( dor ) pulsating stars have been previously identified @xcite .",
    "this part of the color - magnitude diagram is known to contain chemically peculiar am / fm and ap stars , although none has previously been identified in this cluster . with the rich set of information available for these kinds of stars , astrophysical information from one type of star will undoubtedly illuminate the others .",
    "the main , but not the only , focus of the present paper is the brightest known eclipsing binary in the cluster .",
    "the eclipsing binary kic 9777062 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; also star 195 in @xcite , and webda 484 ) under consideration here was first identified in the _ kepler _  eclipsing binary catalog @xcite .",
    "_ kepler _  observed this system almost continuously during the main mission , thanks to a special effort by the science team to study clusters ( the _ kepler _  cluster study ; @xcite ) .",
    "long - period eclipsing binary stars are treasures for stellar astrophysicists because they offer the chance to examine the characteristics of ( effectively ) isolated stars with a high degree of precision and accuracy .",
    "mass and radius in particular can be simultaneously measured to precisions of better than 1% in many cases @xcite .",
    "when one or both of the stars in the binary has evolved significantly off of the zero - age main sequence and approaches the end of core - hydrogen burning , the radius becomes an age - sensitive quantity .",
    "and if the binary is a member of a star cluster , this gives us a means of tightly constraining the age of the cluster and testing stellar evolution theory quite strictly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "variability study of ngc 6811 began with @xcite and continued with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most variable star detections have been pulsating stars ( like @xmath12 sct ) near the turnoff of the cluster , although two possibly eclipsing variables were discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined variability for three early a - type stars in ngc 6811 , including one that appeared to be a binary star .    as part of this paper",
    ", we have examined the photometry and membership of nearly all bright potential members of the cluster .",
    "this step is particularly important for a relatively sparse cluster like ngc 6811 because of the small number of stars in the more advanced stages of evolution .",
    "but even so , high quality photometry for the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) can nonetheless provide strong constraints on the age of the cluster and important physical effects influencing stars near the cluster turnoff . in ",
    "[ obs ] , we describe the observational material we have gathered on the binary kic 9777062 and other stars near the turnoff of ngc 6811 . in ",
    "[ analy ] , we present the analysis of the eclipsing binary kic 9777062 . in the discussion in  [ disc ] , we describe the various observational constraints on the characteristics of ngc 6811 , including the cluster s distance and age .",
    "the chemical composition and reddening values for the cluster are important for the interpretation of many aspects of the work described here , so we will first summarize previous results from the literature and present one new determination of the reddening .    until very recently ,",
    "metallicity determinations have been indirect and not from spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite obtained high - resolution spectra of 5 cluster giants , and the average metallicity derived from these stars were [ fe / h]@xmath17 and @xmath18 using two different abundance analysis algorithms .",
    "it is important to note that i ) neither of these measurements employed asteroseismic @xmath19 measurements , and the average deviation of the measured @xmath19 from the asteroseismic values is about 0.5 dex for the second algorithm , and ii ) the second of these measurements was differential with respect to solar abundances , whereas the remaining measurements described below are not .",
    "@xcite used medium - resolution ( @xmath20 ) spectroscopy along with asteroseismic @xmath19 values for the observed giants to find an average of [ fe / h]@xmath21 , where the quoted uncertainty does not include sources of systematic errors .",
    "( three of the five giant stars they used overlapped with the 2013 sample . )",
    "six cluster giants also have infrared spectroscopic abundances from the apogee survey ( data release 12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which uses synthetic spectra ( employing an @xcite solar abundance mix ) as comparisons .",
    "for these stars , the average metal content is [ m / h]@xmath22 , and iron abundance is [ fe / h]@xmath23 .",
    "@xcite derived a value of [ m / h]@xmath24 from apogee pipeline analysis of 2 members . even with all of the caveats , the different spectroscopic measurements agree surprisingly well .    for our ultimate comparisons with models ,",
    "however , we need to consider effects on the total metal mass fraction @xmath25 more carefully .",
    "the apogee project produces abundance measurements of the cno elements that contribute about half of the metal content . for the six measured giant stars , the average abundances were [ c / h]@xmath26 , [ n / h]@xmath27 , and [ o / h]@xmath28 .",
    "@xcite found solar abundance ratios ( with the exception of an overabundance of ba ) for 31 elements in 5 stars .",
    "although the individual element differences with the sun are potentially interesting , the cno elements taken together imply only a small modification of the @xmath25 relative to the sun .",
    "we will return to this discussion in section [ disc ] .",
    "early studies of the cluster reddening used @xmath29 , but more recent ones have shown evidence for a lower value .",
    "the galactic reddening map of @xcite indicates that the integrated reddening along lines of sight through ngc 6811 should be @xmath30 between 0.129 and 0.135 , and this should be an upper limit for the cluster .",
    "the cluster reddening has been re - evaluated recently , although all of these newer studies effectively compare photometric data to isochrones and are therefore subject to a host of uncertainties , both theoretical ( differences in the physics in the stellar models , and color - temperature transformations ) and observational ( such as the weighting of the contributions from the photometric sample ) .",
    "three studies @xcite used @xmath31 photometry to derive reddenings . @xcite found @xmath32 from fits of an older generation of isochrones to their @xmath31 photometry in the cmd and two - color diagrams . @xcite",
    "derived @xmath33 from a bayesian comparison of their @xmath31 photometry with yale - yonsei and padova isochrones in various cmds .",
    "@xcite derive @xmath34 from a bayesian comparison of their @xmath31 photometry with padova isochrones in cmds and two - color diagrams .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath35 from strmgren photometry , but their cluster member cmd has a large amount of scatter and they derive an unrealistically small age ( about 190 myr ) , so we do not believe this value is reliable .",
    "@xcite quote @xmath36 based on a comparison with parsec isochrones using spectroscopic @xmath37 and asteroseismic information .    to get an independent measure of the interstellar reddening @xmath30 we exploited the calibration of the interstellar na d line strength to @xmath30 by @xcite .",
    "we measured the equivalent width @xmath38 of the interstellar na lines from the spectra of five cluster member giants obtained by @xcite , subtracting in each case the contribution from the overlapping stellar na lines by employing a template spectrum from @xcite with stellar parameters close to those measured by @xcite . to be exact , the parameters were @xmath39 , [ fe / h]@xmath40 , and @xmath41 k. we made use of both the d1 and d2 lines , and the wavelength ranges over which the equivalent width was measured were @xmath42   and @xmath43  , respectively .",
    "we used a factor of 1.1 to estimate @xmath38(d1 ) from @xmath38(d2 ) ( see @xcite ) , and found agreement with the direct estimate of @xmath38(d1 ) for most stars at a level below 0.01 and never worse than 0.02 .",
    "averaging the results from the two lines and then from the 10 spectra ( two of each star ) yielded @xmath44 . using the calibration in table 2 of @xcite this resulted in @xmath45 where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "however , to account also for the uncertainty in the calibration we adopt @xmath46 as our reddening estimate .",
    "we note that @xcite state a much larger uncertainty on the calibration , but we argue as in @xcite that the scatter around their calibration is very low at @xmath30 values below 0.2 ( see lower panel of their figure 4 ) . as additional evidence , this method was used by @xcite to determine the reddening of the open cluster ngc 6791 , producing a value in good agreement with other estimates .",
    "we will use @xmath47 as our primary choice when needed in the analysis below .",
    "long cadence ( 30 min exposure time ) data were recorded for kic 9777062 during the entire 17 quarter duration of the main _ kepler _  mission . in addition ,",
    "short cadence ( 1 min exposure time ) observations were taken during 6 different month - long periods within quarters 4 , 10 , and 14 .",
    "for our analysis we made use of light curves derived from the pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) pipeline @xcite from data release 21 , but we verified that these were good representations of the eclipses by comparing to our own reduction of the raw pixel data .",
    "the pdc pipeline cotrends light curves against those of other stars on the same ccd to identify and remove systematic trends @xcite , and also applies corrections to the flux measurements to account for contamination by other nearby stars .",
    "although kic 9777062 is in the field of ngc 6811 , the cluster is a fairly sparse one and kic 9777062 is well outside the densest parts of the cluster . as a result ,",
    "contaminating light from other stars is a relatively minor consideration : the contamination index ( ratio of contaminating flux to total flux in the photometric aperture ) from the _ kepler _  data search at the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ranged from 0.007 to 0.014 .",
    "after some trials , we settled on the use of short cadence data in our analysis , largely for the greater time resolution .",
    "five of the six months of short cadence data were also taken during the same _ kepler _  observing season , so that the majority of the data came from similar parts of the same ccd module , reducing the importance of instrumental corrections .",
    "the corrected _ kepler _  eclipse light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ phot ] , with the median out - of - eclipse magnitude ( @xmath48 ) subtracted .",
    "the primary and secondary eclipses have different duration and the phase difference between the eclipses is about 0.6 , both of which are indicators of significant eccentricity in the orbits .          in order to obtain color information for the binary",
    ", we obtained eclipse photometry in @xmath49 using the mount laguna observatory ( mlo ) 1 m telescope .",
    "the observational details are given in table [ tableobs ] .",
    "typical exposure times were 300s in @xmath50 , 180 s in @xmath51 and 120 s in @xmath52 .",
    "the images were processed using standard iraf routines to apply overscan corrections from each image , to subtract a master bias frame , and to divide a master flat field frame .",
    "a nonstandard aspect of the image processing involved the correction for a nonlinearity in the ccd response that was present as a result of improperly set readout transistor voltages used between december 2008 and november 2013 . the following correction ( d. leonard , private communication ) @xmath53 $ ]",
    "was applied using the iraf task _ irlincor _ to pixel counts on flat field and object images ( after overscan and bias subtraction ) taken during that time frame .",
    "the nonlinearity had small but noticeable effects on photometric scatter and trends within nights of data .",

    "our brightness measurements were derived from aperture photometry using daophot @xcite , although we took several additional steps to increase the precision of the results .",

    "the radial velocities can also be remeasured using the spectra with one component subtracted .",

    "we use these 35 orders out of 79 because the signal - to - noise ratio is too low in the bluest orders and in the reddest orders the spectra are contaminated by telluric lines . for the uncertainty estimates we use the standard error of the mean ( standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements ) calculated using all 35 orders .",
    "final fies velocities were recalculated during three iterations of the whole disentangling procedure in which the uncertainties of the primary velocities were used as weights when averaging the component spectra .",

    "it is important to note that we did not change @xmath19 ; instead we used the well - determined values from the binary star analysis ( @xmath197 and 4.22 for the primary and secondary , respectively ) . after running several models with different @xmath194  and microturbulence",
    ", we then used the neutral and singly - ionized iron lines ( fe i and fe ii ) to infer the adjustment needed to eliminate any correlation between fe i abundance and either excitation potential or equivalent width .",
    "in addition , we required that fe ii and fe i lines yield the same mean value for the abundance . in the case of fe i lines we used a slight adjustment of the abundance due to nlte effects , following the calculations of @xcite .",

    "we add these contributions in quadrature and find the estimated uncertainty on the metallicity to be 0.13 dex for both components .",

    "[ disent ] , we compare the observed spectra of the two stars with synthetic spectra computed using the parameters listed in table [ abunds ] .",
    "note that for all elements in the figure s synthetic spectra , the abundances were scaled with the fe abundance .",
    "the secondary star appears to have an approximately solar ca to fe abundance ratio , but the primary star is severely underabundant in ca relative to fe . ni and cr , on the other hand , are quite overabundant relative to the sun .",
    "given that other spectroscopic studies of ngc 6811 stars @xcite find abundances close to that of the secondary star , the primary star appears to be anomalous .",
    "the signatures of high metal abundances and low ca abundance identify the primary as an metal - lined am star .",
    "the leading explanation for this phenomenon is diffusion via gravitational settling and radiative levitation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "calcium tends to be underabundant because it has a closed electron shell configuration at the temperature of interest , reducing its radiative cross section near the peak wavelengths of the star s emission .",
    "thus , ca , unlike fe and other metallic species , gravitationally settles into deeper layers .",
    "a - type stars are generally rapid rotators , but when they are not , chemical peculiarities are frequently present : am stars , for example , generally have rotational speeds below 100 km s@xmath174@xcite . both stars in the binary rotate at speeds well below this threshold .",
    "that said , both stars are rotating too fast to have pseudo - synchronized to their orbital angular velocities at periastron passage ( 8.2 and 7.1 km s@xmath101 ; @xcite ) .",
    "so tidal effects appear to have forced the rotation rates lower despite the fact that the theoretical predictions for synchronization by dynamical tides @xcite give timescales that are several orders of magnitude longer than the @xmath221 gyr age of the cluster .",
    "@xcite came to similar conclusions for a sample of field am stars in binaries .",
    "the fact that close to two - thirds of am stars are members of spectroscopic binaries @xcite indicates that tidal effects are an important ingredient in this phenomenon .",
    "for the purposes of our modeling below , this means that the primary star spectrum will not help constrain the bulk ( interior ) chemical abundances of the stars .",
    "we are still left with the measurements of the secondary star and literature measurements of other stars in the cluster , and these are consistent with each other to about @xmath222 of the secondary star measurement error .",
    "the derived spectroscopic temperatures are @xmath201 k and @xmath202 k for the primary and secondary stars .",
    "we computed photometric temperature estimates as checks on these values .",
    "unfortunately , there are fewer well - studied stars for calibrating a and early f stars than there are for g , k , and m spectral types .",
    "we employed relations given by @xcite and @xcite , although it should be noted that there are roughly twice as many a star calibrators in the @xcite paper and thus their value should be considered to be better constrained .",
    "we used the system photometry , luminosity ratios derived from the binary modeling , metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath223 , and an average reddening @xmath46 ( see  [ chemred ] ) in empirical relations using optical colors .",
    "using @xcite relations , we used the @xmath224 color to calculate the primary star ( 7330 k ) and secondary star ( 6950 k ) temperatures .",
    "these are @xmath225 smaller than the spectroscopic values for both stars , but the stars are at the blue end of the quoted range of reliability for the color - temperature relations . [ the @xmath226 color could not be used because the stars were outside the color range . ]",
    "using @xcite relations , temperatures from @xmath226 colors ( around 7590 and 6990 k for the primary and secondary stars , respectively ) are consistent with the spectroscopic values , but the six parameter @xmath224 color relation produces much lower values ( 7040 and 6690 k , respectively ) .",
    "there are , however , few calibrators in the vicinity of the color of our stars , and the fit may be going too low .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty due to the reddening is approximately 100 k using @xmath227 colors .",
    "the am phenomenon operating in the primary star is known to produce line blanketing in the blue part of the spectrum , and this makes an am star redder than it would otherwise have been .",
    "using the @xmath228 calibration specifically for am stars from @xcite , we derive @xmath229 k for the primary star , in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic temperature .",
    "there are benefits in also comparing the spectroscopic temperatures with stars very similar to the ones in kic 9777062 in well - studied eclipsing binary systems : single stars in this range of spectral types tend to be rapidly rotating , which can produce significant gravity darkening and effects due to the angle of observation .",
    "an excellent comparison is xy cet b @xcite .",
    "this star has nearly identical mass ( 0.2% difference ) and similar radius ( 1.5% difference , with xy cet b larger ) as kic 9777062 a , and both are am stars .",
    "@xcite found that the characteristics of xy cet agree best with isochrones for a solar bulk composition and age slightly less ( 850 myr ) than ngc 6811 . but because both stars in xy cet are am stars , the bulk composition can not be directly determined , which could impact the temperatures and the age determination .",
    "otherwise , these indicators point to unusually good agreement between xy cet b and kic 9777062 a. @xcite adopt a temperature of @xmath230 k based on comparisons with synthetic spectra and strmgren photometry , in good agreement with our spectroscopic temperatures .",
    "kic 9777062 b is similar ( less than 2% difference in mass and radius ) to hy vir b , with hy vir b the lower mass star @xcite .",
    "the hy vir system appears to be similar in age to ngc 6811 , but probably slightly older ( 1.35 gyr ) .",
    "although the chemical composition for hy vir has not been spectroscopically measured , the authors find that a super - solar metallicity fits the masses and radii of the stars in the binary .",
    "lower mass , higher age , and higher metallicity would all push the star in the direction of lower temperature , so their quoted value for hy vir b ( @xmath231 k ) should be considered a lower limit for kic 9777062 b. on the other hand , v501 mon b @xcite is approximately 2% larger in mass and has a very similar age ( 1.1 gyr ) and composition ( [ fe / h]=+0.01 ) .",
    "its temperature ( @xmath232 k ) is roughly consistent with that of kic 9777062 b.    in conclusion , we are choosing to depend on the spectroscopically derived temperatures in our analysis below .",
    "this decision is partly based on the difficulties in using photometry to determine temperatures for a stars : there are currently small numbers of calibrators for a stars , disagreement between color - temperature relations from different researchers , and questions of how applicable single star calibrations can be for slowly rotating stars ( as in our eclipsing binary ) .",
    "however , the photometric temperature for the primary from an am star calibration does support our spectroscopic value .      to simultaneously model the ground - based radial velocities and photometry and _ kepler _  photometry , we used the elc code @xcite .",
    "we fitted the binary with a primary set of 14 parameters : orbital period @xmath233 , reference time of conjunction ( primary eclipse ) @xmath234 , velocity semi - amplitude of the primary star @xmath235 , mass ratio @xmath236 , systematic velocities for both stars @xmath237 and @xmath238 , eccentricity @xmath239 , phase difference between eclipses @xmath240 , inclination @xmath241 , ratio of the primary radius to average orbital separation @xmath242 , ratio of radii @xmath243 , temperature ratio @xmath244 , and contamination of the _ kepler _  light curve in the two seasons of short cadence observations .",
    "the _ kepler _  contamination parameters are used to account for possible dilution of the light curves by stars that are not physically associated with the binary .",
    "_ kepler _  pixels and stellar point - spread functions are large by the standards of most ground - based cameras , and it is more difficult to disentangle the light of blended stars . the contamination parameters did not play a major role in the fits , however , because there are no bright contaminating stars nearby . in the fits ,",
    "the contamination parameters themselves are found to be quite small ( 0.03% and 0.45% for the two seasons ) , in accord with values from the _ kepler _  input catalog ( see  [ kphot ] ) .",
    "the light curve is quite flat outside of eclipses , with a small reflection effect ( full amplitude about 0.001 mag ) observable in the _ kepler _  data ( see fig .",
    "[ reflecteffect ] ) .",
    "the maximum occurs around primary eclipse , with a minimum centered on the secondary eclipse .",
    "the variation is asymmetic , in accord with the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "while this type of variation can provide critical information for binaries that do not eclipse @xcite , its physical content is outweighed by the eclipse observations , and we removed the small reflection effect from our light curves and restricted our modeling to eclipses and phases shortly before and after them .    ]    gravity darkening should have a negligible effect on the light curves due to the slowly rotating , nearly spherical stars in this fairly wide binary .",
    "however , limb darkening plays an important role in the determination of the system parameters because only the limb of the secondary star is eclipsed , thanks to the eccentricity of the orbit and its orientation with respect to the line of sight . in turn , the shallowness of the secondary eclipse results in a relatively low signal - to - noise ratio in measurements . as a result , we find that we are unable to reliably fit for the coefficients of a limb darkening law in any passband except _ kepler _ s .",
    "the most important effect of this is on the determination of the luminosity ratios that are needed to constrain the color - magnitude positions of the two stars (  [ cmd ] ) .    to assess the possible systematic errors , we approached the limb darkening in several ways .",
    "a common problem in light curve fitting is that the coefficients of the limb darkening laws are correlated , and fits can sometimes even leave the regime of realistic values .",
    "if theoretical values are used , systematic errors in @xmath194 , log @xmath245 , or composition will lead to systematic errors in fitted parameters .",
    "given the chemical peculiarities seen for the primary star , it is reasonable to wonder whether we could rely on any theoretical coefficients even if @xmath194 and log @xmath245 were perfectly known . in our first approach ( inspired by @xcite ) , we used a quadratic limb darkening law for each passband , held the @xmath59 coefficients fixed at values determined from atlas atmospheres @xcite for the estimated effective temperature and gravity of the star , and fitted for one parameter for each star in the _ kepler _  passband . even if our fixed",
    "_ kepler _",
    "coefficients are in error , this should be largely compensated for by a change in the other ( correlated ) parameter . in the second approach",
    ", we again used a quadratic law , but used the algorithm of @xcite to fit for both coefficients for both stars in the _ kepler _  passband .",
    "@xcite recasted the limb - darkening coefficients in a way that reduces correlation , and which allows for straightforward sampling of the triangular region of physically realistic values .",
    "this last point means that our ignorance about the precise form of the limb darkening for the stars can be fully accounted for in the uncertainties of the derived parameters of the binary system .",
    "kipping s method has been implemented in the elc code . in the third method ,",
    "phoenix atmosphere models @xcite were used to calculate the relative contributions from the two stars to the total flux , but the limb darkening coefficients were fitted using the @xcite algorithm .",
    "this approach is somewhat inconsistent in that the limb darkening in the atmosphere models will not be the same as used in fitting the light curve .",
    "however , the relationship between the fitting parameters and the relative contributions to the total system luminosity will be based on a more sophisticated description of the stellar atmospheres .",
    "we applied the spectroscopic temperature of the primary star @xmath246 ( see  [ constrain ] ) as an observed constraint , allowing the value to vary , but applying a @xmath247 penalty if the value deviated from the input . from numerical experiments",
    ", we found that the models were generally pushed toward temperatures at the high end of the range ( @xmath248 k ) by the combination of _ kepler _  photometry and ground - based observations of the primary eclipse in at least one filter band , despite the @xmath247 penalty .",
    "the depth of the ground - based primary eclipse observations helps set the temperature in combination with the temperature ratio information from the relative sizes of the primary and secondary eclipses derived from the precise _ kepler _  observations .",
    "these shifts are within about @xmath222 of the spectroscopic temperature , however .",
    "the quality of the model fit was quantified by an overall @xmath247 , and the minimum value was sought first using a genetic algorithm @xcite to explore a large swath of parameter space , followed by markov chain monte carlo modeling @xcite to explore models near the minimum and to estimate the uncertainties in the binary model parameters .",
    "the quoted parameter uncertainties are based on the range of values that produce a total @xmath247 within 1 of the minimum value , which approximates a @xmath222 uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the same procedure was used to determine uncertainties in the masses and radii of both stars .    because the uncertainties for the measurements are used in the calculation of @xmath247",
    ", it is important that these uncertainties are as realistic as possible .",
    "we therefore scaled the uncertainty estimates for the radial velocity and photometric observations in order to return a reduced @xmath247 value of 1 for each type of measurement .",
    "( for example , the reduced @xmath247 value for _ kepler _  photometry was used to scale the _ kepler _  photometry uncertainties , the reduced @xmath247 value for the not radial velocities of the primary star was used to scale those uncertainties , and so on . ) this procedure forces the measurement uncertainties to be consistent with the observed scatter around a preliminary best fit model . after this scaling ( by the square root of the reduced @xmath247 ) , we computed final models to determine the binary model parameters and uncertainties .    for the different photometric datasets",
    "the scaling factors were similar : from 1.30 for @xmath50 up to 1.49 for _",
    "kepler_. this procedure was especially important for the velocities because the scatter of the secondary radial velocities around best fit models was always found to be considerably higher than implied by the measurement uncertainties .",
    "for the not velocities , we needed to scale by a factor of 3.8 , and for the het data , by a factor of 2.1 .",
    "( for comparison , we found that the rms variation in the primary star velocities was almost exactly what was expected from the intrinsic measurement uncertainties according to a @xmath247 test , and the scaling factors were less than 10% . )",
    "so , there appears to be a source of velocity variability intrinsic to the secondary star producing this .",
    "the variability may be related to the pulsation of the secondary star ( see  [ to ] ) , but we did not find a correlation between the velocity residuals and the pulsations in the _ kepler _  light curve . from test models , we find that the best fit orbit can be pulled from the better determined solution implied by the primary star .",
    "that said , we do not want to discount the secondary star velocities ( and indeed , we can not if we want to determine masses for the component stars ) . to address this",
    ", we independently fitted an orbit to the secondary star velocities and used the scatter around this solution to scale the velocity uncertainties ( and effectively , the weights ) we used in our final combined fit . this way the secondary star velocities contribute to determination of parameters like the eccentricity @xmath239 and the argument of periastron @xmath249 , but we acknowledge that there are non - orbital effects on them",
    ". the reader should be aware that the differences in weighting the velocities decreased the final masses of about @xmath250 and @xmath251 for the two stars relative to weights based on scatter around the combined fit . because this shift is larger than the statistical uncertainties in the model fits , we quote these systematic uncertainties along with our best fit masses .",
    "we also include a systematic contribution to the uncertainty due to the possible shift in secondary eclipse phase with time ( figure [ tert ] ) : by not modeling this shift we may be introducing scatter in the _ kepler _  eclipse light curves that would appear as a small increase in the derived eclipse widths and radii .",
    "based on the potential shifts , we estimate this effect to come to about @xmath252 for both stars",
    ".    figures [ phot ] and [ rvplot ] show comparisons of the _ kepler _  light curves and radial velocities with the best fit model , and table [ chartab ] shows the parameters of the best fits . for the runs using kipping s algorithm for the limb darkening",
    ", we identified three local minima with @xmath247 within 1 of the minimum value found .",
    "these minima appear to have involved values of the primary star limb darkening coefficients and other parameters ( like inclination ) that depend on the limb darkening . when reporting the best fit values in the table , we give one - sided error bars when the two higher local minima were both on the same side of the apparent global minimum .",
    "the systematic differences between the results using different limb darkening algorithms are one indicator of our limits in being able to reduce parameter uncertainties . for our adopted parameters ,",
    "we use a weighted mean of the values from the three methods with a quoted uncertainty from a quadratic summation of the fit uncertainties ( from the @xmath247 analysis ) and the scatter in the values from the three methods .",

    "the microturbulence velocity parameter @xmath198 ( an indication of the local velocity dispersion in the stellar photosphere ) also corroborates the idea that convection is not only happening in the outermost layers of a stars , but is more vigorous in am stars than in cooler stars @xcite .",

    "are generally used as an ensemble to improve the precision of the mass measurement , which in turn provides the asteroseismic constraint on the age of the cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have also improved the situation here by identifying all of the cluster giants : both @xcite and @xcite studied 5 giants .",
    "as for @xmath194 , @xcite used photometric color-@xmath194 relations , and so were subject to systematic errors involving the poorly known cluster reddening and metallicity at the time .",
    "@xcite derived a mean mass of @xmath398 from a shorter dataset for five stars in this sample .",
    "@xcite used spectroscopic @xmath194 and derived a mean mass of @xmath399 .    after calculating @xmath194 using the more recent low value for reddening [ @xmath46 ; see  [ chemred ] ] and @xmath400 colors ( employing * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mean mass determined from the asteroseismic relations is @xmath401 , where the uncertainties are the error in the mean and the systematic uncertainty due to the reddening , respectively .",
    "the change in the reddening value largely accounts for the difference with the @xcite value .",

    "the improvements underline the idea that the measurements for giants in the open clusters ngc 6791 and ngc 6819 should be revisited with the full _ kepler _  datasets .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that the clump phase , unlike the red giant branch ( rgb ) phase , is long enough that a mass range of at least a few hundredths of a solar mass is expected among the stars there , according to models .",
    "when that is coupled with a small sample of red clump stars as it is in ngc 6811 , the average mass does not constrain the cluster age as strongly as it would with a comparable number of giants in an older cluster .",
    "asteroseismic radii have higher precision than asteroseismic masses ( @xmath403% versus @xmath404% random uncertainty ) , and there is some dependence of the minimum clump star radius on age . for the six clump stars , we find weighted average values @xmath405 and @xmath406 , where the quoted uncertainties are again random and systematic ( due to reddening )",

    "there are potential systematic effects in the models that can affect this comparison , however .",
    "the reddening affects the asteroseismic masses more than the radii , so that a lower reddening moves the stars toward larger ages .",

    "for example , can reduce the computed radii of red clump stars @xcite .",
    "the scaling relations used to calculate the radii may also need to be modified to apply accurately to red clump stars . because the @xmath10 parameter relates to sound speed within a star , and because red clump stars have different structure than the red giant branch stars to which the scaling relations are usually applied ,",

    "our understanding of the frequency structure of @xmath12 sct stars is still limited , but gross features may reveal important information . for example , we expect the radial fundamental mode ( if excited ) to be near the lower frequency limit for @xmath12 sct stars , although this is complicated by rapid rotation and the possible excitation of gravity or mixed modes .",
    "based on dynamical timescale arguments , we should also expect that less luminous stars in ngc 6811 will be significantly more dense and would tend to have their pulsation modes shifted to higher frequencies ( @xmath415 , where @xmath416 is the pulsation constant for the mode ) .",
    "we plot the strongest observed frequencies for each @xmath12 sct star as a function of @xmath51 magnitude in the right panel of fig . [ cmdpuls ] .",
    "a large proportion of the strongest frequencies fall approximately where predicted for the radial fundamental mode ( @xmath417 d ) using average densities derived from fitted isochrones , or using the period - luminosity relation for the fundamental mode of high - amplitude @xmath12 sct stars with hipparcos parallaxes @xcite .",
    "these stars are found from the faint red end of the sample up to near the estimated blue end of the instability strip , consistent with the expectation that the fundamental mode is not excited at the blue edge @xcite .",
    "we believe this , along with the proper motions and color - magnitude positions of the stars , is good evidence that these stars are cluster members .",

    "these frequencies can be found near the dashed line in the right panel of figure [ cmdpuls ] .",
    "although most of the faintest stars only have long cadence _ kepler _  observations , and high frequency pulsations would be above the nyquist limit , several stars with @xmath419 have identifiable frequencies there .",
    "based on these observations , we derived an apparent distance modulus by fitting these data with the @xcite period - luminosity relation .",

    "stars brighter than the most heavily populated part of the main sequence ( @xmath421 ) are potentially important because they could trace the evolution at the time of core hydrogen exhaustion and constrain physical processes ( like convective core overshooting ) that affect the evolution . at the same time ,",

    "the most important is probably kic 9777532/sanders 247 because it has unambiguous evidence of membership and no evidence of binarity .",
    "if its photometry is truly representative of a single star , it probably resides on the blue hook at the end of the main sequence isochrones .",

    "if its photometry is the result of being part of a nearly equal - mass binary , its pulsation frequency would be more in line with fainter cluster stars .",
    "four radial velocity measurements to date ( @xcite ; meibom ) show a large amount of velocity variability consistent with this .",
    "more velocity observations are warranted for this star .",

    "s108 only has one radial velocity observation @xcite , but it deviates from the cluster mean by about 15 km s@xmath101 .",
    "so s247 appears to be the most likely single cluster member among these stars .    for stars on the main sequence above the cluster turnoff ( @xmath423 ) ,",

    "we can only identify one star ( kic 9716220/sanders 113 ) that is a member by all criteria ( radial velocity , proper motion , and pulsations ) , although it shows signs of velocity variability .",
    "three other stars ( kic 9655055/sanders 86 , kic 9655422/sanders 144 , and kic 9655444/sanders 149 ) are proper motion members and pulsators , but each shows velocity variability . two additional stars ( kic 9655005/sanders 77 and kic 9655382/ sanders 134 ) are proper motion members and lack detectable pulsations . both appear to be radial velocity members , but kic 9655005 shows velocity variability while kic 9655382 does not .",
    "the remainder of the stars in this range are eclipsing binaries , have radial velocities that deviate from the cluster mean and could be spectroscopic binaries ( s75 , s87 , s121 , s161 , s188 , s230 ) , or have detectable light travel time effect on @xmath12 sct pulsations ( s87 ; detected using the method of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we will restrict ourselves to at most 6 stars in this range of magnitudes .",

[ cmdpuls ] , and their positions are consistent with other likely cluster single - star members . because the stars appear to fall within the @xmath12 sct and @xmath1 dor instability strips respectively , we searched for evidence of pulsation in the light curve .",

    "data from the entirety of quarter 10 , and subtracted the best fit model of the eclipses .",
    "the spectrum ( fig . [ s195spec ] ) shows no evidence of @xmath12 sct frequencies ( @xmath427 cycles per day ) , but there are some low frequencies that may be associated with @xmath1 dor pulsation .",
    "the amplitudes are about 0.25 millimag for the two strongest modes ( 0.6133 and 0.9525 c / d ) .",
    "the small amplitude of the modes ( about an order of magnitude smaller in size than the secondary eclipse ) means that they affect the eclipse light curves minimally .",
    "the pulsations probably result from the secondary star because the primary star appears to be well outside the estimated position of the @xmath1 dor instability strip .",
    "as the pulsations are coherent , we investigated whether frequency modulation due to the binary orbit could be measured and used to identify which of the binary components is oscillating . because we have characterized the binary orbit , we can predict the amplitudes of the sidelobes of the dominating observed oscillation modes in the power spectrum @xcite and these are far too low to be measurable .",
    "we also tested whether any phase shift could be measured @xcite when fitting frequencies of the strongest modes to the light curve and isolating different orbital phases in the light curve , but we did not find any signal .",
    "however , we note that during the primary eclipse the light curve with the best - fit model subtracted show slightly increased scatter compared to the out - of - eclipse variation , which we take as indication that the pulsations originate from the secondary component .",

    "points have the same meaning as in fig . [ cmdpuls ] . [ redcmd ] ]    because we have mass measurements for the kic 9777062 stars , we can force isochrones to fit their cmd positions , thereby constraining isochrone positioning further .",

    "tests of these assumptions are beyond the scope of this paper , but the analysis of other eclipsing binaries in the cluster would help .",

    "[ cmdfix ] ]    systematic uncertainties are always important considerations for age measurements , and we briefly discuss them here .",
    "metallicity uncertainties , whether due to the cluster or to solar composition , affect the ages at the level of a few hundredths of a gyr ( see the parsec and victoria - regina panels of figs .",
    "[ tomr ] and [ cmdfix ] ) .",
    "there are a number of stellar physics uncertainties that could affect whether the isochrones truly represent observed stars near the turnoff .",
    "one of these is rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which is expected to extend the lifetimes of main sequence stars and make them appear more luminous . while the stars of the eclipsing binary should not be affected",
    ", ages determined from rotating turnoff stars would be biased toward younger ages .",
    "this effect is difficult to evaluate properly , and may require examination of spectroscopic rotational velocities for a large sample of the turnoff stars .    for most of our comparisons utilizing the components of kic 9777062 , we will be insensitive to the details of convective core overshooting because this has its most observable effects near core hydrogen exhaustion or beyond .",
    "so at present , the photometry of the bright main sequence stars is our main constraint on this process . without a more detailed survey of the radial velocities of turnoff stars to evaluate binarity",
    ", we can not say much more than the cluster cmd seems to be consistent with overshooting in an amount of approximately 0.2 pressure scale heights , as is used in the dartmouth , yonsei - yale , and parsec models .",
    "because we produced measurements covering a disparate set of techniques , it is worth summarizing the results and examining the degree to which the different techniques produce consistent results .",
    "asteroseismic masses and radii for clump giants in the cluster imply an age near 0.9 gyr , but this estimate may suffer from significant systematic uncertainties , including the treatment of convection in the isochrones and the asteroseismic scaling relations used to calculate the radii .    the masses and radii measured for the stars in the eclipsing binary imply different ages , with the primary appearing younger than the secondary star ( @xmath472 gyr versus @xmath473 gyr ) .",
    "because the primary star shows the am metal - line phenomenon , we believe it is more likely to be experiencing physics effects ( like diffusion ) that are not properly represented in the models used to interpret the age .",
    "if the two stars in the binary have lower metallicity than used in the model isochrones , this would also tend to slightly improve the agreement of the ages derived separately from each of them .",
    "age determinations from the cmd require some decision on how much the isochrones need to be shifted in magnitude and color .",
    "while fits are frequently done to derive distance , reddening , and age simultaneously , uncertainties in the color-@xmath194 relations assumed in the isochrones affect the validity of the inferred values .",
    "if we shift isochrones to match the @xmath51 magnitude of the secondary star in the eclipsing binary at its measured mass , the implied distance modulus is in rough agreement with our independently derived values from fitting a period - luminosity relation to the cluster @xmath12 sct stars and from asteroseismology of the giant stars .",
    "however , the preferred cmd age in this case appears to be near 1.0 gyr ( uncertainty around 0.05 gyr ) , in disagreement with the secondary star mass - radius measurement .",
    "it should be remembered that the cmd age is dependent on our ability to isolate a sample of single stars that are brighter than the turnoff ( @xmath474 ) . in a sparse cluster like ngc 6811 , this is challenging , and more radial velocity and asteroseismic work can be done to verify that the stars in our sample do not have bound companions .",
    "in addition , if cluster stars have higher metallicity than used in the isochrones , the cmd age would move older .",
    "a higher metallicity makes the mass - radius ages of the kic 9777062 stars disagree more , however , and leads to the conclusion that consistency in the ages can not be achieved by simply assuming a different metal abundance .",
    "we presented a detailed analysis of the first detached eclipsing binary member of the open cluster ngc 6811 containing stars near the turnoff .",
    "the primary star shows surface abundance anomalies consistent with being a metal - line am star , and one of the stars ( probably the secondary , based on its cmd position , radial velocity scatter , and increased photometric scatter during primary eclipse ) is a @xmath1 dor pulsating star .",
    "the indication of a convective blueshift for the primary star implies that it probably has a turbulent surface convection zone that is shallow enough to allow diffusive chemical separation and the am phenomenon .",
    "the less massive secondary star does not show chemical peculiarities and shows a lower microturbulent velocity , implying that its surface convection zone goes deep enough to circumvent diffusive separation .",
    "nearly all stars in well - measured binaries with masses between 1.3 and @xmath475 appear chemically normal .",
    "a surprising outcome of the measurement of the stellar masses and radii is that they indicate different ages , with the secondary star returning an age that is 15 - 20% larger than the primary star . in lower mass and shorter period binaries",
    "this kind of discrepancy has been attributed to induced magnetic activity and inhibition of convective energy transport that leads to a larger radius for the secondary star having a deeper convective zone . while the stars are rotating slowly and thereby",
    "show signs of tidal interaction , the orbital period is much longer than any binaries showing radius discrepancies among lower mass stars and the convection zones in these stars would themselves be much lower in mass and less likely to be affected by magnetic activity . on the other hand , more than a third of am stars in the fields observed by _ kepler _",
    "have been shown to have photometric variations that are likely due to spots @xcite .",
    "further , there are other well - studied eclipsing binaries containing more massive am stars that show similar patterns in their masses and radii .",
    "regardless , we have yet to identify a convincing explanation why at least one of these stars seems to have an anomalous radius when compared with models",
    ".    deeper study of other types of stars in the cluster may help clarify the picture . with",
    "the large number of @xmath12 sct pulsating stars occupying the turnoff of this cluster , this binary and others provide the excellent opportunity to determine accurate masses for an ensemble of pulsating stars with extensive _ kepler _  photometry in order to derive additional strong observational constraints on stellar models .",
    "one application we examined was the use of the period - luminosity relation for high - amplitude @xmath12 sct stars with _ hipparcos _ parallaxes to derive an independent measure of the distance modulus .",
    "a promising line of future research is the derivation of mean stellar densities from the equivalent of the large frequency spacing for these stars @xcite .",
    "we re - examined the sample of secondary clump and asymptotic giant stars in the cluster and re - analyzed their asteroseismic data from the main _ kepler _  field . the small sample of clump stars ( there are no first - ascent red giants ) and",
    "the relatively large measurement uncertainties do not allow us to produce a tight constraint on the age , but the mass - radius values are consistent with a 0.9 gyr age .",
    "a deeper analysis going beyond the observables @xmath10 and @xmath11 could further test the consistency of the asteroseismic results with measurements from the cmd , the main sequence pulsators , and the eclipsing binary stars .    at the end of this survey",
    ", we have not found a model of any age that is consistent with all of the observations .",
    "the results tend to break in to groups near 1.0 gyr ( the mass and radius of the primary of the eclipsing binary ; photometry of turnoff stars when isochrones are pinned to the mass and photometry of the secondary star ; the asteroseismic masses and radii of the secondary clump stars ) or near 1.2 gyr ( the mass and radius of the secondary star ) .",
    "the distance moduli we have derived from the eclipsing binary and @xmath12 sct stars also differ with each other at the 0.1 mag level , with the @xmath12 sct result being closer to the isochrone predictions .",
    "there are significant differences between the predictions of different sets of isochrones and significant uncertainties that currently limit our ability to identify a preferred age and distance .",
    "observations that would improve the situation include : further radial velocity study of the brightest main sequence stars ( especially the subgiant candidate kic 9777532 ) to find or rule out previously undetected binary companions ; characterization of additional eclipsing binaries in the cluster ; and establishment of more precise spectroscopic temperatures for turnoff stars . on the theoretical side ,",
    "there is a need to identify the sources of the differences between sets of isochrones , and to test and improve the treatment of helium and heavy element diffusion . at the turnoff of ngc 6811 , the mix of stars  with and without binary companions , and with different rates of rotation",

    "we opted to use our own observations to recalibrate the ngc 6940 stars because we observed this cluster over a significantly larger range of airmass than our other standard fields and would therefore be in a better position to evaluate airmass - dependent terms in the photometric transformations below .",

    "we compared our @xmath56 photometry with two previously published datasets , partly to provide an independent check of literature photometry and to test whether different photometric observations of this extended cluster could realistically be combined together . using 82 stars in common with the photoelectric photometry of @xcite",

    "the cluster was covered by tiling together multiple fields , but @xcite also made use of multiple telescope / instrument combinations .",
    "the section of the field that shows the greatest evidence of a position - dependent trend was their hall telescope field from 2010 . based on this",
    ", we believe we have done a slightly better job of removing position - dependent trends , but the @xcite study has somewhat better signal - to - noise , as seen in reduced scatter among main sequence stars in figure [ cmdmem ] .",
    "we looked at systems in the compilation of @xcite that had stars in the mass range covered by these stars ( approximately @xmath485 ) , supplemented with additional eclipsing am binaries from more recent literature @xcite .",
    "detached systems like these should contain stars with equal age and bulk composition ( although the surface composition may be greatly affected ) , so that each pair _ should _ lie on the same isochrone if the am / fm phenomenon is unimportant . in fig .",

    "however , in other cases it is less clear that age or composition can be used to explain the system properties . among the more important examples :    * bp vul @xcite : both stars in this system",
    "show the metal - line phenomenon , and so the bulk composition can not be inferred from the system itself . however ,",
    "the stars are close to those of kic 9777062 in @xmath436 space , and they share a very similar slope in @xmath436 plane .",
    "the authors found that the primary star implied a slightly younger age than the secondary star for a common bulk composition . with the caveat that the bulk composition is not well determined",
    ", the inferred age of the system is also quite similar to that of kic 9777062 .",
    "it should be noted that secondary of bp vul is one of the least massive stars in this binary star sample showing the fm phenomenon  no other binary component in the range @xmath486 is known to show metal line anomalies .",
    "* xy cet @xcite : this system is composed of two am stars in a short period ( 2.78 d ) binary , and the secondary star has a mass and radius that are within about 1% of those of the primary of kic 9777062 .",

    "the best match was to solar abundance models with age near 850 myr . * ww aur @xcite : the line segment connecting the stars in this system presents a rather shallow slope that undoubtedly helped push the authors to infer a _ highly _ super - solar metal abundance and young age ( 90 myr ) .",
    "it should be noted that those authors did not see evidence that the am phenomenon was the cause of the unusual stellar properties .",
    "* other systems showing shallower slopes in the @xmath436 plane than expected : ai hya @xcite , v624 her @xcite , hw cma @xcite    binaries that show this radius discrepancy also appear to show a discrepancy in the relative magnitudes of the two stars , in the sense that the primary star tends to be fainter than expected based on the mass and brightness of the secondary star .",
    "kic 9777062 follows this pattern as well ( see  [ cmd ] ) .",
    "kic 9777062 is a valuable addition to the list above because there are constraints on the bulk composition of the stars from both the secondary star and from other stars in the cluster itself .",
    "diffusion is important in the interiors of both stars given that they are both rotating slowly and are massive enough to have mostly radiative envelopes .",
    "however , only the primary shows surface heavy element abundances consistent with being a metal - lined star .",
    "the lack of @xmath12 sct pulsation from the primary may indicate that helium is draining out of the he ii ionization zone that drives the pulsation  a significant fraction of am stars pulsate , but usually at lower amplitude levels than typical @xmath12 sct stars @xcite .",
    "models , however , predict that diffusion should result in larger radii @xcite due to increased metal opacity in the surface layers , which runs contrary to what we see in the kic 9777062 binary . if the am stars in kic 9777062 and other binaries are indeed anomalously small in radius , the physical mechanism is still unclear and it is odd that the effect only shows up in some binaries .",
