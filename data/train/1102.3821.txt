    "detecting and characterizing entanglement in quantum systems is a major issue of quantum information theory , both from the theoretical and from the experimental point of view @xcite . in this context entanglement witnesses ( ews )",
    "turn out to be useful tools that allow one to address this problem with a minimal experimental effort , even in those cases where a complete tomographic reconstruction of the state is not experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "indeed , this technique merely requires one to measure a single ( non local ) observable whose expectation value yields a certifiable evidence of the presence of entanglement in the system .",
    "unfortunately it can not provide a definitive answer for all system configurations ( indeed in most of the cases , the result of the measurement will be inconclusive ) .",
    "furthermore , even when successful , the result of an ew measure will not be useful in general to quantify the amount of entanglement present in the system .",
    "still it was recently pointed out @xcite that the outcome of such measurements can be used to provide at least non trivial ( lower ) bounds for the latter .",
    "these observations led to the notion of quantitative entanglement witness ( qew ) @xcite , which identify those operators whose expectation values can be translated into a quantification of the entanglement present in the measured system .    from a purely technical point of view , it is worth stressing that even though qews were originally discussed in the context of standard ews , they can be thought as independent from the latter .",
    "indeed an ew is characterized by well established properties , e.g. it must assume positive values on all separable states , and it must have at least one negative eigenvalue @xcite . on the contrary the definition of qew can be applied to any operator @xmath0 for which it is possible to associate a non trivial _ bounding function _ ( see next section ) for a given entanglement measure .",
    "notable examples of such qews were already known in literature even before the formal introduction of this notion , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "in particular the idea of bounding the entanglement of a state via the acquisition of a single expectation value was addressed in a series of papers @xcite that applied previous ideas on twirling transformations @xcite and werner states @xcite ; the same argument has been extended lately to isotropic states @xcite .",
    "the geometrical properties of werner and isotropic states can be used to build explicitely qew capable of detecting up to a high degree of bipartite entanglement . in this paper",
    "we review the derivation of such qew @xcite adopting a formal yet simple scheme . subsequently using an explicit decomposition of such operators in terms of correlated local observables",
    "@xcite we perform a data - processing optimization which will enable further tightening of the entanglement bounds .",
    "expressing ew or qew in terms of local operation and classical communication ( locc ) measurement schemes is yet another important aspect of entanglement detection @xcite .",
    "it deals with the problem of acquiring expectations values of a non - local observable ( i.e. an observable that does not admit a separable basis of eigenvectors ) , when only local resources are accessible experimentally .",
    "even though the decomposition we assume is not the most efficient one in terms of setup preparations @xcite , it has the main advantage of being easily implementable in some specific experimental configurations which exploit multi - rail quantum encoding strategies @xcite .",
    "we will explicitly focus on some optical scheme based on _ hyper - entanglement _ setups @xcite where bipartite entangled qudits states are generated by exploiting spatial and polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after reviewing some basic definitions around quantitative entanglement witness , in section [ sec : qew ] we focus on qews of werner class and of isotropic class for which we present the optimal bounding functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : deco ] we introduce the local decompositions for such qews which use @xmath1 independent set - up preparations ( @xmath2 being the local dimension of a system site ) .",
    "we then show how the same measurement outcomes can be post - processed to strengthen the entanglement bounds .",
    "[ sec : as ] finally discusses how to implement the proposed measurement scheme in the context of optical multi - rail encodings .",
    "let @xmath0 be an observable acting on a bipartite system @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 be a given convex and continuous measure of bipartite entanglement , e.g. the entanglement of formation @xcite .",

    "analogously to a standard entanglement witness @xcite , a qew provides an operational method for detecting entanglement .",
    "furthermore it also yields a quantitative estimation of it .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , a fundamental problem is to find the",
    "_ optimal _ bounding function of a given qew @xmath0 , i.e. the highest positive @xmath5 for which holds .",
    "the latter can be formally defined as @xmath8 } = x \\vphantom{\\sum } \\right.\\right\\}\\;,\\ ] ] where the minimization is performed over the whole set of density matrices .",
    "this is a convex ( generally not monotonic ) function which typically is rather difficult to obtain .",
    "a partial characterization of @xmath9 was proposed in @xcite where it was pointed out that , due to the convexity of entanglement measures , we can write @xmath10 where the supremum is taken over all real values of the parameter @xmath11 and where @xmath12 is the _ legendre transform _ of the measure functional @xmath4 , with respect to the trace scalar product , i.e. @xmath13 } - { \\mathcal{e}_{\\mathcal{m}}}(\\rho ) \\right\\}\\;,\\ ] ] ( here the supremum is taken over the whole set of density matrices ) .",
    "a useful property of the set of qew is that it is invariant under local operation and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "in particular any ( non trivial ) unitary locc transformation @xmath14 takes a given qew into a new qew while preserving its bounding functions including the optimal one , which is trivially again optimal @xcite .",

    "unfortunately @xmath19 is a rather complicated ( nonlinear ) function of the state @xmath7 which is arguably hard to compute .",
    "still , we will see in the following that , for the cases we consider here , an operational characterization of it can be obtained by focusing on a subclass of @xmath14",
    ".      finding the optimal bounding functions for qews is a hard problem @xcite .",
    "however there are certain highly symmetric choices of @xmath0 for which @xmath21 can be obtained without going through the optimizations of ( [ alt ] ) .",
    "prototypical examples are given by the operators @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the canonical basis for the subsystem @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( both assumed to be @xmath2-dimensional ) .",
    "the first is nothing but the swap operator on the composite system @xmath3 , while the second is a projector into the ( not normalized ) maximally entangled state with constant coefficients .",
    "they are related via partial transpose ( i.e. @xmath26 ) and are qews which we can call of _ werner class _ and of _ isotropic class _ respectively , for reasons which will be clear soon .",
    "their optimal bounding functions can be computed for several entanglement measures including entanglement of formation ( @xmath27 ) , relative entropy of entanglement @xcite , and convex - roof extended negativity @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    "however in the following we focus only on the former . in this case",
    "the optimal bounding functions for @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively given by @xmath30 & \\mbox{for $ x>1 $ , } \\\\",
    "0 & \\mbox{for $ x\\leq 1 $ , }   \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the binary shannon entropy , @xmath32 is the function @xmath33 , and @xmath34 means taking the convex - hull of the inner expression , i.e. the largest convex curve nowhere larger than the given one ",
    "notice however that in ( [ co ] ) the argument is already convex when @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "proving that the operator @xmath28 is a qew with optimal bounding function ( [ co ] ) involves the knowledge of the properties of werner states @xcite and notion of _ twirling _ transformations @xcite .",
    "werner states @xmath36 in an @xmath37 space are those which are unvariant under the whole @xmath38 group of transformations @xmath39 for all unitaries @xmath40 on @xmath41 .",

    "the transformation @xmath54 is often labeled as _ twirling operation _",
    "three properties of @xmath55 are important to mention for our purposes @xcite : first , @xmath55 is a projector , i.e. @xmath56 , and its range is exactly the 1d manifold of werner states . moreover ,",
    "@xmath55 preserves the expectation value of @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath57 } =   { \\mbox{tr } \\left [ { \\mathbb{f}}\\,{\\mathcal{p}_\\lambda}(\\rho ) \\right]}$ ] , which , along with , tells us that @xmath58}\\right).\\ ] ] finally , since its kraus decomposition is made of tensor product operators , @xmath55 is a ( non - invertible ) locc transformation .",
    "therefore it can only decrease entanglement , thus providing the following inequality @xmath59 putting together , and we finally obtain @xcite @xmath60})\\;,\\ ] ] for any given state @xmath7 , which is the proper definition of bounding function for @xmath50 .",
    "to check optimality , it is sufficient to see that for any @xmath61 $ ] there is a density matrix @xmath7 with @xmath62 } = x$ ] for which equality holds : this happens for the werner state @xmath63 .",
    "then , since for any function @xmath5 higher in @xmath64 than @xmath50 , the condition would be broken , @xmath50 must be optimal .",
    "the proof of the optimality of the function ( [ co ] ) for the isotropic qew @xmath29 is similar to the one we exploited in the werner case .",
    "this time we consider isotropic states @xcite , i.e. the set of states @xmath65 invariant under every transformation of the form @xmath66 where ",
    "@xmath67 \" denotes complex conjugation of the matrix entries , say , with respect to the canonical basis .",
    "isotropic states form again a one - parameter family , defined by @xmath68,\\ ] ] with @xmath69 and @xmath29 as in ( [ swap1 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 is also the expectation value @xmath71}$ ] . on top of that",
    ", their entanglement of formation is known @xcite to be given by @xmath72 .",
    "again , we exploit the properties of a twirling operation , this time of the form @xmath73 which projects @xcite any given state @xmath7 in the isotropic state @xmath74})$ ] while preserving the expectation value of @xmath29 and degrading the entanglement of formation . following these considerations",
    "we get @xcite @xmath75}),\\label{isoine}\\ ] ] so that @xmath76 is a bounding function for @xmath29 , and it is optimal since any function pointwise higher would break the bounding condition upon one isotropic state at least ( it is worth pointing out that the inequality ( [ isoine ] ) was originally derived in @xcite without invoking the properties of twirling ) .",
    "a practical problem in entanglement detection is how to acquire expectation values of non - local observables ( for instance our qews ) , while we are typically allowed to perform only locc measurements @xcite .",
    "the standard solution is to expand the witness operator @xmath0 into a sum of local observables of the form @xmath77 with @xmath78 being some complex coefficients .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath0 can then be reconstructed by simple data post - processing from the expectation values of the tensor product observables @xmath79 which can be acquired by performing classical correlated measures on @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the decomposition ( [ deco ] ) is not unique and , unless @xmath0 admits a set of separable eigenvectors @xcite , it will involve a certain number of non - commuting operators @xmath80 . in this case several independent experimental setups need to be prepared , one for each non - commuting set of observables @xmath80 entering into ( [ deco ] ) .",
    "it is thus reasonable to try and optimize the local decomposition in a way that it corresponds to the smallest possible experimental effort .",
    "this problem gathered a lot of attention @xcite but it appears that no general solution has been found yet . instead , several specific solutions for particular classes of witnesses have been proposed .    in this section",
    "we focus on a local decomposition of the qews of the werner and isotropic class which was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "such solution is not the most efficient one in terms of number of setup re - preparation .",
    "indeed it requires @xmath81 independent setups , while a theoretical lower bound of @xmath2 was presented in @xcite which , at least for @xmath2 is prime is known to be achievable @xcite .",
    "yet the proposed decomposition presents at least two advantages .",
    "first , as we shall see in section [ multiple ] , by simply reprocessing the data accumulated during the various experiment runs , one can obtain expectation values of an ( exponentially large ) class of qew operators which are locc - equivalent in the sense of ( [ eq : questa ] ) to the one we started with .",
    "this leads us to the experimental acquisition of several entanglement bounds which are optimal in the sense of ( [ eq : optimal ] ) : upon taking their highest value we can hence provide an estimation of the quantity @xmath19 of ( [ eq : questa1 ] ) . secondly , as we shall see in section [ sec : as ] , the proposed decomposition scheme appears to be naturally suited for multi - rail encoding implementations .    to start we introduce the following set of ( local ) single - site observables @xmath82 defined for any @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( as before the vectors @xmath85 stands for the canonical basis of the site ) .",
    "since they form a basis for the space of operators acting on @xmath41 , we can express @xmath28 and @xmath29 as follows , @xmath86 which is of the form ( [ deco ] ) with @xmath87 terms and with the coefficients @xmath78 being real .",
    "therefore the expectations values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 can both be acquired with at most order @xmath87 independent experimental setups .",
    "of course , some of the operators appearing in the sums ( [ eq : fdec ] ) commute with each other , so in principle it is possible to evaluate them within the same experiment .",
    "for instance any pair of operators of the set @xmath88 commute _ iff _ all the indexes are different , and clearly this commutation rule extends to all the observable of the form @xmath89 with @xmath90 . exploiting this simple property one",
    "can indeed reduce @xcite the number of setup re - preparations needed to obtain the all values @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath92 from @xmath87 to order @xmath2 ( here we use @xmath93 to represent the expectation value with respect to the state @xmath7 ) . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we review this result by re - deriving using a different method than that presented in @xcite .",
    "to do so we find it convenient to turn the problem into a graph colouring game .",
    "let us assume that we have a graph made of @xmath2 vertices and all the possible edges among them ( also known as _",
    "complete _ graph ) , e.g. see figures [ img : sette ] and [ img : sei ] ; we are also given one green brush to colour the vertices with , alongside with one blue and one red brushes to paint the edges of the graph .",
    "the idea is that when we paint the @xmath94-th vertex green we are actually acquiring @xmath91 , while if we paint in red ( resp .",
    "blue ) the edge connecting the nodes @xmath94 and @xmath95 we evaluate @xmath96 ( resp .",
    "@xmath97 ) . as a rule ,",
    "during a single turn the player can paint everything he wants , but _ not _ :",
    "* an edge and a vertex at one of its ends , * two consecutive edges , * the same edge twice ;    clearly , these game rules encode the commutation relations we discussed .",
    "the aim of this game is to paint all the vertices green and all the segments in both red and blue spending the minimal number of turns .",
    "optimal solution for the game are presented next :    , first two steps . a red line connecting vertices @xmath94 and @xmath95 means measuring @xmath98 , the green dot is the measurement of @xmath99 .",
    "[ img : sette ] ]    _ colouring for @xmath2 odd _ - for simplicity , we draw the graph like a regular polygon with @xmath2 edges , including all the diagonals , see figure [ img : sette ] . at the first turn the player paints in red one edge and all the diagonals that are parallel to that edge , as well as the farthest vertex , obviously green . from turn 2 to @xmath2 he chooses everytime another edge of the polygon and repeats the process , until all the edges have been chosen . from turn @xmath100",
    "to @xmath1 he does the same thing he did in the first @xmath2 turns but using the blue brush instead of the red one . that completes the game , in @xmath1 turns .",
    "this colouring strategy is optimal because , due to the rules , every turn a player can not paint more than @xmath101 segments , and we have @xmath102 segments to paint , so that @xmath1 is actually a lower bound for the game turns .    _",
    "colouring for @xmath2 even _ - this time we draw the graph as a @xmath103 sided regular polygon , with the additional vertex in the geometric center , and consider all the edges , diagonals , and vertex - centre segments , see figure [ img : sei ] . at the first turn the player paints in red one edge , the parallel disgonals , and the segments joining the center with the farthest vertex .",
    "afterwards , he rotates the pattern ; and subsequently he does the same withthe blue brush .",
    "when he is finished , he uses a turn to paint all the vertices . that completes the game in @xmath104 turns . as before , @xmath105 is a lower bound for painting the segments , but if that is the case we need at least one additional turn to paint the dots . therefore , this colouring strategy is optimal .      in the previous section we presented a strategy for evaluating @xmath106 and @xmath107 according to the local decompositions ( [ eq : fdec ] ) .",
    "now we want to show that it is possible to reprocess the same ( classical ) data to obtain expectation values of other qews .",
    "these are generated from @xmath28 and @xmath29 by means of local invertible transformations as discussed in section [ sec : qew ] .",
    "specifically we focus on the following phase shift operators @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a generic 2-valued function .",
    "now , let us define    .",
    "turns 1 , 2 and 11 are drawn .",
    "the six - th vertex has been placed in the geometrical center of the pentagon .",
    "[ img : sei ] ]    @xmath110    for all choices of @xmath111 , these observables are qews of werner and isotropic class respectively ( they are just associated with werner and isotropic states defined on a different basis ) . furthermore since they are locc equivalent to the original @xmath28 and @xmath29 , their optimal bounding function are still given by ( [ co ] ) . by optimizing with respect to all",

    "these expressions can be further simplified by exploiting the monotonicity properties of @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( the former is non increasing while the latter is non decreasing ) to move the optimization over @xmath111 on their arguments .",

    "\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are complicated ( non linear ) function of the state @xmath7 which are related to the quantity @xmath19 of ( [ eq : questa1 ] ) .",
    "the main difference is that the latter was optimized with respect to the whole set of unitary locc transformations @xmath14 , while @xmath118 and @xmath119 are optimized only with respect to the a proper subset of such set , namely the phase flips ( [ unitary ] ) .",
    "luckily enough we can simplify @xmath118 and @xmath119 by rewriting the operators @xmath120 and @xmath121 in terms of the operators ( [ eq : pairings ] ) .",
    "indeed by doing so we find that they are made of the very same @xmath87 operators appearing in , namely , @xmath122 and @xmath123 this implies in particular that their expectation values can be recovered by the same set of locc measurements required for @xmath106 and @xmath124 , allowing us to build @xmath125 independent new werner qews of the form @xmath120 , as well as @xmath125 independent new isotropic qews of the form @xmath121 by simple data post - processing [ the number @xmath125 follows from the fact that there are @xmath126 possible @xmath111 functions , but @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "clearly this is a very simple and cheap way to substantially increase the information we can gather on @xmath7 . as a matter of fact",
    "the expressions ( [ defgamma ] ) and ( [ deggamma ] ) are also useful to simplify the optimizations of .",
    "in particular define the @xmath129 matrix @xmath130 of elements , @xmath131 where , as usual , @xmath93 stands for taking the expectation value with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "these matrices are composed by the measurement outcomes one acquires when recovering the expectation values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 via the local decomposition introduced in the previous section .",
    "in particular we can write , @xmath132 } & =   \\sum_{\\alpha , \\beta }    \\xi(\\alpha )   \\ ; m_{\\alpha,\\beta}^{(+ ) }   \\ ;   \\xi(\\beta ) \\equiv \\vec{\\xi}^{\\;t } \\cdot m^{(+ ) } \\cdot \\vec{\\xi } \\ ; , \\\\   { \\mbox{tr } \\left [ { \\mathbb{g}}(\\xi ) \\,\\rho \\right ] } & = \\sum_{\\alpha , \\beta }    \\xi(\\alpha )   \\ ; m_{\\alpha,\\beta}^{(- ) }   \\ ;",

    "therefore , in order to determine the values ( [ eq : star ] ) is sufficient to respectively minimize or maximize these quantities over @xmath134 ; i.e. @xmath135 unfortunately , apart from the trivial case of @xmath35 , providing a general analytical solution for these expressions is nontrivial and dependent on @xmath130 ( indeed it is formally equivalent to find a ground state of a frustrated , classical many - body spin system ) . on the other hand",
    ", one can easily evaluate upper bounds as follows @xmath136 even though for @xmath137 they will be in general not tight and will not be useful to lower bound the entanglement of formation of the system .",
    "luckily enough however the optimizations ( [ ffd5 ] ) are treatable numerically , especially considering that for the experimental implementation we are interested in , @xmath2 is usually of the order of magnitude of units ( see next section ) .",
    "qew techniques for estimating lower bounds of entanglement of a quantum state are suitable , in principle , to any experimental setting or physical apparatus .",
    "yet , we are inclined to think that the proposed local decomposition scheme of werner and isotropic witnesses we presented in the previous section would be particularly fit to _ multi - rail encoding _ experimental settings . in such implementations ,",
    "a state @xmath85 of the canonical basis is represented by the presence of a particle / carrier in a specific transmission channel ( e.g. spatial mode , polarization , time - bin or orbital angular momentum ) indexed by @xmath94 .",
    "multi - rail encodings are common both in optics @xcite and in electronics ( e.g. see @xcite ) . in",
    "the following however we will focus only on the former case as it is intrinsically more flexible .",
    "for these architectures the qew detection strategy discussed in section [ sec : deco ] entails to properly mixing a pair of incoming modes via simple beam - splitter transformations and to perform photo - coincidence counting measurements at the exit port of the device , see figure [ img : setup ] .",
    "accordingly the proposed locc measurements appear to be more suited to detect entanglement in these systems than ( say ) the optimal schemes of @xcite which requires coherent mixing among multiple channels .",
    "( colour online ) example of data sampling for @xmath3 system in which the local degree of freedom of each site is composed by three independent optical channels ( here represented as spatially separated for simplicity ) .",
    "the figure represent the fist step of the detection strategy : applying the @xmath138 transmittive beam splitter and measuring @xmath139 gives us the expectation value of @xmath140 ( if we put a @xmath141 phase shift on channel 2 , we would have @xmath142 instead ) ; at the same time we also acquire @xmath143 . for later steps",
    ", we need to permute the channels in the picture and perform those measurements as well . ]",
    "consider for instance two separated sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 of ( monochromatic ) spatial optical modes .",
    "within each of the two subsystems a single photon is injected and allowed to flow through @xmath2 possible optical paths . in one of experimental setup of @xcite for instance , @xmath144 was realized by exploiting polarization and 2 different spatial degree of freedom . a generic ( pure )",
    "state of the system can then be written as @xmath145 where the @xmath146 is the annihilation operator of a photon flowing through channel @xmath94 at port / subsystem @xmath147 , and where @xmath148 stands for the two photon state @xmath149 .",
    "we will describe local transformations on photonic state as a forward elastic scattering process @xmath150 with @xmath40 and @xmath151 unitaries which acts on the @xmath24 and @xmath25 sets respectively . after applying such transformation all we have to do",
    "is record the channel - selective photo - coincindence measurements @xmath152 this way we achieve simultaneously the expectation values of the @xmath87 one dimensional projectors of the form @xmath153 .",
    "the last step is to identify a proper set of unitaries @xmath40 and @xmath151 that lead to the determination of the quantities @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 which are needed for characterizing the selected qew . for instance assume we want to measure the expectation value of @xmath98 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent to two distinct channels .",
    "then @xmath40 and @xmath151 could be implemented as hadamard gates , acting in both subsystems a and b , which couples the pair of such channels .",
    "this entails the implementation of a beam - splitter transformation of transmissivity @xmath138 which coherently mixes the two channels .",
    "after that , we can convert coincidence measurements into data via @xmath157 similarly , if our goal were to obtain @xmath97 instead , the unitarities @xmath40 and @xmath151 could be chosen as hadamard transformations , this time applied after a local phase shift ( e.g. of @xmath158 acting upon channel @xmath95 ) .",
    "see figure [ img : setup ] for details .",
    "we can now translate into experimental operations every possible strategy for the local qew decomposition of section [ sec : deco ] .    as a concluding remark we point out that the same analysis can be generalized to an electronic implementation of multi - rail encodings @xcite . in this case",
    "the ports @xmath24 and @xmath25 will correspond to independent leads , whose transverse modes play the role of the optical paths . under appropriate conditions",
    "@xcite the coincidence counting ( [ ph - count ] ) can be related to the zero - frequency shot noise , which is a measurable quantity . in @xcite , for example , a procedure for constructing ews was employed for different solid - state systems for the case of two transverse modes per lead . in such systems , however , an experimental limitation is represented by the difficulty of working with more than two modes .",
    "we have reviewed the notion of qews and clarified that there exist a class of such operators for which the optimal bounding function can be easily determined without necessarily going through the complex optimization procedure of ( [ eq : optimal ] ) and ( [ alt ] ) .",
    "for these qews we then considered an explicit local decomposition that allows one to acquire the needed expectation values via a limited number of locc measurements .",
    "the proposed scheme is not optimal in terms of number of independent setups one need to prepare , but has two main advantage with respect to other schemes @xcite . in particular we can easily optimize with respect a large class of unitary locc providing an operational characterization of the associated non linear quantities , see ( [ fvv ] ) .",
    "furthermore we have shown that it is suitable for experimental implementations based on multi - rail encodings by means of simple two - mode transformations ( beam - splitter mixings ) followed by correlated photo - counting detections .    _",

    "the qew set is clearly invariant under the whole set of locc transformations .",
    "however if the mapping @xmath14 is not invertible ( i.e. not unitary ) then the optimal bounding function of the new observable @xmath159 needs not to coincide with the original one .",
    "this is a rather special case where one can easily show that the two qew are basically locc equivalent in the sense discussed in ( [ eq : questa ] ) . indeed in this case @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of @xmath28 via a proper local unitary transformation plus a constant term which can be compensated via classical data post - processing ."
