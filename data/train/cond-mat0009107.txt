    "during last several decades the electronic structure calculations from first principles became an important part of the solid state theory .",
    "the solution of such essentially many - particle problem as calculation of band structure of real materials is impossible without rather severe approximations .",
    "the most famous and commonly used approximation in _",
    "ab  initio _ electronic structure calculations is density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "but , as an approximation based on the homogeneous electron gas theory  @xcite , the lsda is valid only for compounds with slow varying through the crystal charge density . in other words ,",
    "the lsda must describe well only the delocalized electronic states ( broad bands ) .",
    "nevertheless the lsda is sometimes able to give correct ground state properties for the systems with rather narrow bands ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the most unusual physical properties were found in the systems with strong electron - electron coulomb correlations ( such as mott insulators ,   high-@xmath4 superconductors , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "these systems have been intensively investigated during last 20 years both by experimentalist and theoretician communities .",
    "all intriguing features of these systems come from the existence of nearly localized electronic states ( narrow bands ) such as  _ d _  or  _ f _ states of transition metals ions or rare - earth metals ions , respectively . to mark out the localized state one can apply the following criteria : kinetic energy of localized states is of the same or even smaller order of magnitude as the energy of coulomb interactions .",
    "it is known that for strongly - correlated systems the lsda often fails ( high-@xmath4 related compound la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ; insulating , antiferromagnetic transition metal oxides ) .",
    "however constrained lsda calculations  @xcite give coulomb interaction parameter values in surprisingly good agreement with the experimental estimations  @xcite .",
    "several approaches were built on the lsda basis repairing its deficiency in describing coulomb interaction between localized states .",
    "the most popular methods are the self - interaction correction method ( sic )  @xcite and the lda+u method  @xcite .",
    "the basic problem of the lsda is the orbital - independent potential which does not allow to reproduce coulomb interaction derived energy splitting between occupied and empty subbands .",
    "the sic method solves this problem by introducing the orbital - dependent potential correction which explicitly substracts the self - interaction present in the lsda .",
    "this method restores correct electronic properties of the transition metal oxides where the lsda fails .",
    "however the self - interaction correction for the _ d _  states is so strong , that when one implements sic potential only to the _ d_-orbitals of transition metal then the oxygen _",
    "p_-orbitals do not shift from the lsda obtained positions and the occupied _",
    "d_-band lies much lower in energy than oxygen valence band , which does not agree with the spectroscopy data .",
    "however the values of energy gaps and the spin magnetic moments are in rather good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "to improve this situation one can treat all valence states ( namely the transition metal ions _ d_-orbitals and oxygen _ p_-orbitals ) as localized and apply sic potential to all of them  @xcite . in this case structure of occupied bands",
    "is well reproduced , but the value of energy gaps will be overestimated  @xcite .    another way to overcome the well known disadvantages of the lsda is the lda+u method , which gives better agreement with experimental spectra  @xcite .",
    "the lda+u method corresponds to the static limit of recently developed new many - body approach    the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . in its standard form",
    "the lda+u takes into account only coulomb interaction between  _ d _  ( or  _ f _ )  electrons of transition metal ions . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the problem of coulomb interaction between oxygen _ p _  electrons and show that the inclusion of the corresponding term in lda+u equations leads to significant improvement of agreement between calculated and experimental spectral and magnetic properties .",
    "the main idea of the lda+u method is to add to the lsda functional the term @xmath5 corresponding to the mean - field approximation of the coulomb interaction in multiband hubbard model .",
    "^\\sigma ( { \\bf % r)}]+e^u[\\{n^\\sigma \\}]-e_{dc}[\\{n^\\sigma \\}],\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the charge density for spin-@xmath8 electrons and @xmath9 $ ] is the standard lsda ( local spin - density approximation ) functional .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) asserts that the lsda is sufficient in the absence of orbital polarizations , while the latter are driven by , @xmath10=\\frac 12\\sum_{\\{m\\},\\sigma } \\{\\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime } , m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } \\rangle n_{mm^{\\prime } } ^\\sigma n_{m^{\\prime \\prime } m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } } ^{-\\sigma } + \\\\   \\\\   ( \\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime } , m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } \\rangle -\\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } , m^{\\prime } \\rangle ) n_{mm^{\\prime } } ^\\sigma n_{m^{\\prime \\prime } m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } } ^\\sigma \\ } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where  @xmath11 are the screened coulomb interactions among the _ d _  electrons . finally , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) corrects for double counting ( in the absence of orbital polarizations , eq .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) should reduce to  @xmath12 ) and is given by    @xmath13=\\frac 12un(n-1)-\\frac 12j[n^{\\uparrow } ( n^{\\uparrow } -1)+n^{\\downarrow } ( n^{\\downarrow } -1)],\\ ] ]    were @xmath14 and @xmath15 . @xmath16  and  @xmath17 are screened coulomb and exchange parameters  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual lsda potential , an effective single - particle potential to be used in the effective single - particle hamiltonian has the form :    @xmath18    @xmath19    the matrix elements of coulomb interaction can be expressed in terms of complex spherical harmonics and effective slater integrals  @xmath20  @xcite as @xmath21 where  @xmath22 and    @xmath23 for  _ d _  electrons one needs  @xmath24 and  @xmath25 and these can be linked to the coulomb- and stoner parameters  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 obtained from the lsda - supercell procedures via  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 , while the ratio  @xmath28 is to a good accuracy a constant  @xmath29 for the  3__d _ _ elements  @xcite .",
    "( for  _ f _  electrons the corresponding expression is  @xmath30 ) . the coulomb parameter  @xmath16 is calculated as a second derivative of the total energy ( or the first derivative of the corresponding eigenvalue ) in respect to the occupancy of localized orbitals of the central atom in a supercell with fixed occupancies on all other atoms  @xcite .",
    "if one neglects the exchange and non - sphericity of the coulomb interaction ( which is exact in the case of the fully occupied or empty band ) the potential correction will have the more simple form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the occupancy of @xmath33-orbital .",
    "then for fully occupied state lda+u potential correction would be the shift to the lower energies on @xmath34 , while for empty states it gives an upward shift on the same value .",
    "so the lda+u gives correct splitting between occupied and empty subbands equal to the coulomb interaction parameter  @xmath16 .    in the lda+u approach",
    "the coulomb interactions are taken into account conventionally only on _",
    "d_-orbitals of transition metals .",
    "however it is known that coulomb interactions between electrons on _ p_-orbitals of oxygen have comparable order of magnitude  @xcite with the corresponding  @xmath35 coulomb interactions and so must be taken into consideration on the same footing as for _ d_-orbitals . the usual justification for omitting of @xmath16 on oxygen",
    "_ p_-shell is that the oxygen shell is fully occupied and the correlation effects between electrons ( or rather holes ) in it can be neglected due to the small number of holes in ground state .",
    "however the lda+u equations  ( [ vlda ] ) will give nonzero correction for the fully occupied oxygen band : @xmath36 this potential correction must be applied to the orbitals forming oxygen band , however corresponding wannier functions ( in contrast to _ d _",
    "states ) are far from being of pure o(2__p _",
    "_ ) character because they have very strong admixture of  _ s _  and  _ p _  states of transition metal ions and other extended orbitals . since the main influence on the electronic structure is the change of the energy separation between the oxygen _ p_-band and the transition metal _",
    "d_-band , the upward shift in energy of the transition metal _",
    "d_-band on  @xmath37 will be equivalent to the shifting down of the oxygen _",
    "p_-band on the same value .",
    "thus in our calculations we added  @xmath37 term to the diagonal matrix elements of the lda+u potential correction  ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "we call this extension of the lda+u method in the paper as the  lda+u@xmath38 .",
    "recently the modified  lda+u@xmath38 method was used by korotin  _ et al . _ for investigation of charge and orbital ordering effects in la@xmath39sr@xmath40mno@xmath41 compound  @xcite . the inclusion of coulomb interactions in the oxygen _",
    "p_-shell was found to be crucial in that calculation , since it controls the value of charge transfer energy between mn(3__d _ _ ) and o(2__p _ _ ) valence states and significantly enhances the tendency of localization in this system .    in the present paper",
    "we report the results with the use of the modified lda+u@xmath38 method for the typical strongly correlated transition metal oxides nio , mno and la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .",
    "we show that inclusion of the correlations in oxygen _",
    "p_-shell leads to the better agreement with the experimental data for the main peaks position in x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and bremsstrahlung isohromate spectroscopy ( bis ) spectra in comparison with conventional lda+u calculated spectra",
    ". not only spectral properties , but both spin magnetic moments and intersite exchange interaction parameters  @xmath42 for nio , mno and  la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 are in better agreement with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the important part of the lda+u calculation scheme is the determination of coulomb interaction parameters  @xmath16  and  @xmath17 in equations  ( [ pot ] ) : coulomb parameter  @xmath0 for _ p_-orbitals of oxygen ,  @xmath1 for transition metals ion and hund s parameter  @xmath17 for _ d_-orbitals of transition metals . to get  @xmath1  and",
    "@xmath17 one can use the supercell procedure  @xcite or the constrained lsda method  @xcite , which are based on calculation of the variation of the total energy as a function of the local occupation of the _ d_-shell .",
    "we took the values of  @xmath1 and  @xmath17 parameters listed in table  i previously calculated  in  @xcite .",
    "the problem is how to determine the coulomb parameter  @xmath0 .    due to more extended nature of the  o(2__p _ _ ) wannier states in comparison with transition metal _ d _  states , the constrained occupation calculations can not be implemented as easy as for the  _ d_-shell of transition metals .",
    "nevertheless several independent and different techniques were used for this purpose previously by different authors .",
    "mcmahan  _ et al .",
    "_ estimated the value of  @xmath0 in high-@xmath4 related compound  la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 using the constrained lda calculation where only atomic - like o(2__p__)-orbitals within oxygen atomic spheres were considered instead of the more extended wannier functions .",
    "the corresponding value of coulomb interaction parameter  @xmath0 was obtained as  @xmath43 .",
    "this value can be considered as the upper limit of the exact  @xmath0 .",
    "the lda calculations gave the estimation that only  75% of wannier function density lies in the oxygen atomic sphere so that renormalized value of coulomb interaction parameter for oxygen wannier functions is  @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "later hybertsen  _ et al . _ suggested the scheme to calculate  @xmath0 , which consists of two steps : ( i )  via constrained - density - functional approach one can obtain the energy surface  @xmath45 as a function of local charge states and ( ii )  simultaneously extended hubbard model was solved in mean - field approximation as a function of local charge states  @xmath46 and  @xmath47 .",
    "corresponding coulomb interaction parameters were extracted as those which give the energy surface matching the microscopic density - functional calculations results  @xcite .",
    "the obtained values for  @xmath0 are  @xmath48 depending on the parameters of calculations .",
    "another way to estimate  @xmath0 is to use auger spectroscopy data , where two holes in o(2__p__)-shell are created in the excitation process .",
    "such fitting to the experimental spectra gave the value of  @xmath49  @xcite . in our  lda+u@xmath38 calculations we used  @xmath50 .    to solve the lda+u hamiltonian we implemented the self - consistent tight - binding  ( tb ) linear muffin - tin orbitals method  ( lmto ) in the atomic sphere approximation  ( asa )  @xcite .",
    "for the calculations we choose the classical strongly correlated transition metal oxides nio , mno and la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , which were well investigated by experimental and theoretical methods .",
    "comparison between the lda+u ( left column ) and the lda+u@xmath38 ( right column ) calculated density of states ( dos ) of nio , mno and la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is presented in figures  1 ,  2  and  3 . for all compounds one can see that the main difference between the lda+u@xmath38 and the lda+u calculated densities of states is the increased energy separation between the oxygen  2__p _ _ and transition metal  3__d _ _ bands .",
    "the larger value of `` charge transfer '' energy  ( o(2__p__)-me(3__d _ _ ) ) ( me = ni , mn , cu ) leads to the enhanced ionicity and decreased covalency nature of the electronic structure : the unoccupied bands have more pronounced  3__d _ _ character and the admixture of oxygen states to those bands becomes weaker .",
    "the ground state is correctly described both by lda+u and lda+u@xmath38 calculations as antiferromagnetic insulator for all compounds .",
    "the values of energy gaps  @xcite and spin magnetic moments are presented in tables  ii  and  iii .",
    "one can see that the values obtained in the lda+u@xmath38 calculations are in general in better agreement with experiment than the lda+u calculated values . while the increasing of the energy gap values with applying  @xmath0 correction was obviously expected with the increasing of `` charge transfer '' energy in the compounds belonging to the class of `` charge transfer '' insulators  @xcite ,",
    "the increasing of the magnetic moments values is more complicated self - consistency effect due to the increased ionicity in the lda+u@xmath38 calculations comparing with the lda+u results .    in fig .  4 the dos obtained by lda+u@xmath38 and lda+u calculations for mno and nio compounds",
    "are compared with the superimposed xps and bis spectra corresponding to the removal of an electron ( the occupied bands ) and addition of an electron ( the empty bands ) , respectively .",
    "the better agreement with the experimental data of position of the main peaks of unoccupied band relative to the occupied one is the direct confirmation of the importance of taking into account coulomb interactions in oxygen  2__p__-shell .",
    "the values of the intersite exchange interaction parameters  @xmath42 depend on the parameters of the electronic structure in a rather indirect implicit way .",
    "the developing of the good calculating scheme for exchange parameters is very important because the _ ab - initio _ calculation is often the only way to describe the magnetic properties of complicated compounds such as for example `` spin - gap '' systems  @xcite .",
    "recently solovyev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite did very through analysis of the exchange interaction parameters for mno calculated using different methods of electronic structure calculations .",
    "they used the positions of the  mn(3__d__)-spin - up and  mn(3__d__)-spin - down bands relative to the oxygen  2__p _ _ states as adjustable parameters to fit the values of exchange interaction for the nearest and second  mn - mn neighbors .",
    "their results gave nearly the same splitting between  mn(3__d__)-spin - up and  mn(3__d__)-spin - down states as in standard lda+u calculations   ( @xmath51 ) but the position of those states relative to the oxygen band was shifted approximately on  @xmath52 up relative to the lda+u case .",
    "it is practically the same as we have in our lda+u@xmath38 calculations , because with  @xmath50 the shift of the position  me(3__d__)-band relative to the oxygen  o(2__p__)-band is equal to  @xmath53 .",
    "comparison between lda+u and lda+u@xmath38 calculated  @xmath42 parameters and experimental data is presented in table  iv .",
    "@xmath42 were calculated from greens function method as second derivatives of the ground state energy with respect to the magnetic moment rotation angle  @xcite .",
    "again one can see that in general the lda+u@xmath38 gives better results than the lda+u , especially for mno compound .",
    "the method for inclusion of coulomb interactions between oxygen  _ p _  electrons in the calculation scheme of the lda+u method was proposed .",
    "the main effect was found to be the increasing of `` charge transfer '' energy parameter ( the separation of  o(2__p _ _ ) and  me(3__d _ _ ) states ) . as the result",
    ", the spectral and magnetic properties of the typical strongly correlated transition metal oxides nio , mno and la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 were found in better agreement with experimental data than in the conventional lda+u method where only correlations between  me(3__d _ _ ) state are taken into account .",
