    "<S> we propose a simple picture for the occurrence of superconductivity and the pressure dependence of the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath0 , in zrzn@xmath1 . according to our hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> the pairing potential is independent of pressure , but the exchange splitting , @xmath2 , leads to a pressure dependence in the ( spin dependent ) density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , @xmath3 . assuming p - wave pairing @xmath0 is dependent on @xmath3 which ensures that , in the absence of non - magnetic impurities , @xmath0 decreases as pressure is applied until it reaches a minimum in the paramagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> disorder reduces this minimum to zero , this gives the illusion that the superconductivity disappears at the same pressure as ferromagnetism does .    </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity is a problem of long standing and general interest . </S>",
    "<S> thus its recent discovery in uge@xmath1 @xcite , zrzn@xmath1 @xcite and urhge @xcite is attracting considerable attention . </S>",
    "<S> in particular its occurrence in zrzn@xmath1 is intriguing because , at ambient pressure , zrzn@xmath1 is a weak ferromagnet ( @xmath4  k ) and by the application of pressure it can be tuned through a quantum critical point ( qcp ) ( @xmath5  kbar ) to become a paramagnetic metal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this revives an old suggestion of fay and appel . </S>",
    "<S> these authors calculated @xmath0 mediated by paramagnons in a mcmillan like formalism and found that there is superconductivity in the ( triplet ) a@xmath6 channel @xcite on both sides of the qcp . </S>",
    "<S> however , while the broad description of fay and appel agrees with the observations the fine details do not . in fay and appel </S>",
    "<S> s theory the transition temperature goes to zero at the qcp , @xmath0 then rises to a ( local ) maxima as the model is tuned away from criticality ( experimentally this corresponds to pressure being varied away from @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 then falls again away from the qcp . </S>",
    "<S> they also predicted that @xmath0 would be approximately the same magnitude in both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic sides of the phase diagram ( although slightly higher on the paramagnetic side ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when superconductivity was observed in zrzn@xmath1 it was only seen on the ferromagnetic side of the phase diagram and further the maximum in @xmath0 was observed at ambient pressure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments show a monotonic decrease in @xmath0 with pressure until about 18 kbar . </S>",
    "<S> no data has been published in the pressure range 18 kbar @xmath8  22 kbar , therefore one can not ascertain where in this range @xmath0 falls to zero . </S>",
    "<S> several groups have attempted to explain this either by revisiting the theory of fay and appel and examining specific coupling mechanisms @xcite or by considering the problem within a ginzburg  </S>",
    "<S> landau formalism . both of these groups predicted that @xmath0 goes to zero at @xmath7 . here </S>",
    "<S> we will present a simple alternative to these scenarios for the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in zrzn@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that no variation in the coupling constant with pressure ( i.e. proximity to the qcp ) is required to explain the experiments due to the natural enhancement of the a@xmath6 phase transition temperature in the ferromagnetic phase and the extreme sensitivity of the triplet pairing states to scattering from non - magnetic impurities . on the other hand our arguments rely on zrzn@xmath1 being a rare example of a stoner ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly in our consideration the qcp plays no special role and the pressure at which superconductivity disappears is predicted to be strongly sample dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to consider the problem via the simplest model which has the possibility of illustrating the relevant physical phenomena : triplet superconductivity and ferromagnetism . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we study a one band hubbard model with an effective , attractive , pairwise , nearest neighbour interaction , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we allow ferromagnetism to enter via the stoner model which appears to be in good agreement with the observed behaviour of the ferromagnetic phase of zrzn@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we study the consequences of the following hamiltonian :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the usual annihilation ( creation ) operators for electrons with spin @xmath12 occupying a tight binding orbital centred on the lattice site labelled by @xmath13 . to render the model tractable we assume that the sites @xmath13 form a simple cubic lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> for a general triplet pairing state in a field gap equations can not be derived in the same way as they can for the zero field case . however , if we specialise to the case of equal spin pairing ( esp ) and neglect the action of the dipolar field on the orbital motion of the electrons a remarkable simplification occurs as shown in reference @xcite the gap equations are    @xmath14    where the quasiparticle spectrum is given by    @xmath15    equations ( [ eqn : gap eqn ] ) and ( [ eqn : simple spectrum ] ) have several surprising features . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , there is a complete decoupling of the two spin states ; even in the presence of cooper pairing . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the exchange splitting enters only in the role of a chemical potential , but with opposite signs for the two spin states . </S>",
    "<S> it must be stressed that these results are only valid for esp states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large exchange splitting in a ferromagnet probably precludes opposite spin pairing ( osp ) states ( that is singlet states , @xmath16 triplet states or even the fulde  </S>",
    "<S> ferrell  </S>",
    "<S> larkin  </S>",
    "<S> ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state , which is only stable for moderate exchange splittings ) . in short and are just the hartree  fock  gorkov approximations restricted to the esp sector of the theory . for @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> no such restriction is required as osp states are not a possibility .    </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath18 , @xmath19 and we find the linearised gap equations :    @xmath20    before solving these equations numerically we must first choose the hoping integrals , @xmath21 , and the coupling constants @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the hoping integrals with an on site ( @xmath22 ) and nearest neighbour terms only so as to give the same relative density of states in the region of the fermi level as is found in _ ab initio _ band structure calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dos from our fit is compared with that found in the _ ab initio _ calculation in figure [ fig : zrzn2_dos ] . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , our one band model can not reproduce the complex behaviour of the dos over the full energy range of the zr related d - band , nevertheless , within an energy range of 20  mev about the fermi energy it does do so . since @xmath9 depends on only one parameter : @xmath23 for sites @xmath13 and @xmath24 being nearest neighbours ( @xmath25 otherwise ) it can be determined by reference to the measured @xmath0 for clean zrzn@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is hampered by the extreme sensitivity of triplet pairing to scattering from non - magnetic impurities @xcite and by the lack of data . using experimental estimates of the residual resistivity , @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that what little data there is @xcite is consistent with a clean superconducting critical temperature , at ambient pressure , @xmath27  k as shown in the inset to .    </S>",
    "<S> we solved ( [ eqn : linearised gap eqn ] ) numerically with @xmath28 on a k - space integration mesh of @xmath29 points . </S>",
    "<S> such a fine integration mesh is required to accurately reproduce the dos . </S>",
    "<S> our method ( implicitly ) requires an accurate calculation of the @xmath3 as we are varying the exchange splitting and thus we are changing @xmath3 , so any errors in evaluating @xmath3 will lead to significant errors in our calculation of the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of our numerical calculations are shown in . the a@xmath6 phase displays superconductivity in only the @xmath30 channel . in the a@xmath6 phase @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the usual bw vector order parameter for triplet superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the a@xmath1 phase corresponds to superconductivity in both esp channels but with different amplitudes in the two channels so that @xmath33 where @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the a phase , which is only stable in zero exchange spitting , has the same pairing amplitude for both of the esp states , corresponding to the order parameter @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the complete separation of the up and down sheets the linearised gap equations can be used to calculate the lower transition temperature , @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this transition represents the formation of a superconducting state in the minority spin state . </S>",
    "<S> our phase diagram of course assumes that no other phase transitions occur . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the a@xmath6 and a@xmath1 phases only is consistent with a general symmetry analysis @xcite and the ginzburg  </S>",
    "<S> landau expansion of the free energy @xcite .    to make contact with experiment we must allow for the strong dependence of the superconducting transition temperature of a p - wave superconductor on non - magnetic impurity scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is done via the abrikosov  </S>",
    "<S> gorkov formula :    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the quasiparticle lifetime as measured in transport experiments and @xmath39 is the digamma function . </S>",
    "<S> note that we do not need to worry about the baltensperger  </S>",
    "<S> sarma equation @xcite , which accounts for the reduction in the critical temperature of a superconductor due to exchange splitting , as this is only valid for osp states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the abrikosov  gorkov formula can be used to calculate @xmath0 as a function of @xmath38 , or equivalently @xmath26 via the drude formula . to make the most of the available experimental data we used the abrikosov  </S>",
    "<S> gorkov formula to investigate the effect of disorder on the above phase diagram ( see ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the final step needed to make a direct comparison with measurements of @xmath0 as a function of pressure is to note that , experimentally , the curie temperature is a linear function of pressure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the zero temperature magnetisation is also linear in pressure @xcite and thus proportional to @xmath41 ( as is predicted by the stoner model ) , giving @xmath42 . for a stoner ferromagnet , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetisation is linearly dependent on the exchange splitting and hence    @xmath43    we now invoke the fact that @xmath44 which implies that @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can map the results of @xmath46 ( shown in figure [ fig : tc_e_ref ] ) onto @xmath47 which we show in figure [ fig : tc_p ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that although quantitative agreement with experiment is not achieved , the general features of experiment are reproduced by several of the curves .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that we have demonstrated the viability of the following simple picture . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of the mechanism of pairing and exchange splitting zrzn@xmath1 is a p - wave superconductor with a low @xmath48  k ( at ambient pressure ) . </S>",
    "<S> this superconductivity is not observed in the paramagnetic phase of currently available samples due to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> however , the exchange field enhances @xmath0 of an a@xmath6 p - wave state and this is the cause of the observed superconductivity in the ferromagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> experiment suggests @xcite zrzn@xmath1 is a rare stoner ferromagnet for which the exchange splitting is proportional to the magnetic order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> thus when @xmath49 and therefore @xmath50 there is no measurable superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , improvement in sample quality will lead to a lowering of the residual resistivity and thus presents the possibility of the observation of superconductivity in the paramagnetic state ( as is demonstrated by the curves with @xmath51 cm in ) . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation is consistent with and lends microscopic support to the more phenomenological arguments of walker and samokhin and mineev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a pleasure to thank stephen hayden , stephen yates and gilles santi for sharing their results with us and for helpful discussions . </S>",
    "<S> we would also like to thank the laboratory for advanced computation in the mathematical sciences ( http://lacms.maths.bris.ac.uk ) for extensive use of their beowulf facilities . </S>",
    "<S> one of the authors ( bjp ) was supported by an epsrc studentship and , in the final stages of this work , by the australian research council . </S>"
