    "one of the major goals of the current generation of x - ray observatories has been to identify those source populations which are primarily responsible for the bulk of the overall energy density , which peaks at 30 kev . in particular , we aim to classify those sources contributing to the source counts in the range 2 - 10 kev , and to recognize those with the hardest spectra .",
