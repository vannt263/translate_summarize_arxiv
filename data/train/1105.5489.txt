    "we study theoretically the resistive state in short superconducting microbridges ( with length l less than the coherence length @xmath2 ) at temperatures close to the critical one .",
    "this subject was widely discussed and studied in the 70-ies of last century ( for review see @xcite ) and has regained renewed interest recently ( see for example refs .",
    "interesting phenomena occurring in such a system , and which are still not completely understood , are : i ) the hysteresis of current - voltage ( iv ) characteristics at relatively low temperatures @xcite and ii ) the foot-like ( sometimes also called shoulder-like - see ref .",
    "@xcite ) feature in the iv characteristics observed experimentally mainly in tin microbridges at low voltages and at temperatures close to @xmath3 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the hysteresis is usually explained by joule heating while for the foot-like structure several theories were proposed @xcite that are based on the idea that the quasiparticle distribution function is out of equilibrium ( overcooled ) as a consequence of the variation in time of the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter @xmath4 in the superconducting microbridge .",
    "the motivation for those theories comes from the fact that the energy of the quasiparticles depends on @xmath0 and when the characteristic time scale for the variation of @xmath0 is smaller than the inelastic relaxation time @xmath5 of the quasiparticle distribution function @xmath6 the occupancy of the states with energy @xmath7 may differ from the equilibrium one ( for a detailed discussion see the book of tinkham @xcite ) .    to simplify the analytical treatment of the problem the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite assumed that in the dynamic ( resistive ) state @xmath0 varies as fast as @xmath8 and to find the coordinate and time dependence of @xmath9 they solved the _ stationary _ ginzburg - landau equation with a time dependent @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore they assumed that : 1)the relaxation term in the kinetic equations can be neglected when the period of oscillations of the order parameter is much smaller than @xmath5 , 2 ) the spectral functions depend only on the local magnitude of the order parameter @xmath0 ( so called local approach ) .",
    "we argue that for a realistic inelastic relaxation time @xmath5 , and even for a short microbridge @xmath11 the nonequilibrium contributions to @xmath6 strongly affects the dynamics of @xmath0 and results in a larger time scale for @xmath0 than for @xmath8 .",
    "moreover the relaxation term in the kinetic equations plays a very important role at any voltage and therefore can not be omitted . taken together with the dependence of the spectral functions on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 they provide an averaged heating of the quasiparticles , instead of cooling @xcite .",
    "some kind of cooling of quasiparticles at high voltages can be found only when one takes into account additional terms in the kinetic equations which couple the longitudinal @xmath12 ( odd in energy ) and transverse @xmath13 ( even in energy ) parts of @xmath14 due to the finite spectral supercurrent ( in previous works @xcite these terms were omitted ) .",
    "this cooling is not effective at low voltages and heating together with the large time scale of the variation of @xmath0 result in a hysteresis of the iv characteristics for relatively large @xmath5 .",
    "we should stress that the time averaged heating of quasiparticles is driven by oscillations of @xmath0 in the superconducting microbridge and _ not _ by joule dissipation @xmath15 ( * j * is the current density and * e * is the electric field ) .",

    "it allowed one to linearize the collision integral due to electron - phonon collisions and to write it in the relaxation time approximation .",
    "furthermore , it was assumed that the inelastic relaxation time due to electron - electron interactions is much larger than due to electron - phonon and hence one can neglect the corresponding collision integral .        to model the superconducting microbridge connected to superconducting bulk leads in the current carrying regime we consider the system shown in fig .",
    "it consists of normal bulk reservoirs where the external voltage @xmath51 is applied and the constriction is modelled as a film with variable cross - section @xmath52 ( here @xmath53 is the cross - section , @xmath54 is the width and @xmath55 is the thickness of the film ( in this way we model variable thickness microbridge ) .",

    "the large normal part of the film is needed because in the boundary conditions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 enters the voltage @xmath60 ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) and almost all the voltage drop occurs in the normal part of the film , effectively leading to a state with applied constant current even when the microbridge transits to the resistive state . due to the large ratio @xmath61",
    "the transport current does not destroy superconductivity in the wide part of the film and we mainly study the resistive state in the microbridge . in our calculations",
    "we assume that the lateral size of the film is much smaller than the london penetration depth @xmath62 ( or effective penetration depth @xmath63 ) and therefore we may neglect screening effects .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that the current density is distributed uniformly over the width of the film . this assumption is strictly speaking not valid in the region where the current transits from the wide part to the narrow one ( and vice versus ) .",
    "but because the current density is much smaller in the wide part than in the narrow part we may neglect such type of effects ( at least for variable thickness microbridges ) and consider variables which are averaged over the width and thickness of the film .",
    "because the length of the microbridge is much larger than its width we may assume an uniform current distribution over the width of the microbridge .",
