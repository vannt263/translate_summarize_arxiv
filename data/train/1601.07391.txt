    "the experimental observation @xcite that neutrinos are massive and oscillate between flavours indicates that lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) does take place in the neutral sector .",
    "when neutrino mass terms are included in the standard model ( sm ) they induce also one - loop lfv decays of charged leptons ( clfv ) like , for instance , @xmath3 .",
    "however due to the tiny ratio between the neutrino mass and the electroweak energy scale , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "its present upper bound ( at @xmath5 ) is given by the meg experiment @xmath6 @xcite , expecting to reach one order of magnitude less in the current upgrade .",
    "hence the sm predicts unobservable branching ratios for clfv decays in the foreseen future .",
    "this setting provides an ideal benchmark for the hunt of new physics beyond sm .",
    "the experimental observation of clfv is the goal of a bunch of excellent dedicated experiments @xcite like , for instance , meg , mega , sindrum and mu3e in the search of muon decays , and those looking for muon conversion in the presence of nuclei , sindrum ii , mu2e or comet / prism .",
    "the first generation of b - factories , that stand for @xmath7 factories too like babar or belle , have joined in the pursuit of clfv decays coming from the @xmath7 lepton @xcite . though they have focused mainly in processes with leptons ( and photons ) in the final state",
    ", both experiments have also provided excellent bounds on hadron decays of the tau lepton , for the first time @xcite , for instance @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is short for a pseudoscalar ( vector ) meson .",
    "the study of lfv in decays of the tau lepton are also one of the main goals of the future superkekb / belle ii project under construction at kek ( japan ) @xcite .",
    "while the theoretical study of lfv tau decays involving only leptons has a long story ( see @xcite and references therein ) , lfv hadron decays of the tau lepton have only been slightly surveyed @xcite .",
    "there are a few studies within models of susy @xcite , within the littlest higgs model with t - parity @xcite , and with the 331 model @xcite .",
    "a thorough study of the role of the higgs contribution to the decay of @xmath12 has also been carried out @xcite . here",
    "we explore those decays within the simplest little higgs ( slh ) model @xcite .",
    "little higgs ( lh ) models @xcite arise from the old idea of a composite higgs boson @xcite where some collective symmetry breaking , that allows the higgs mass to become loop suppressed , has been implemented @xcite . as a consequence electroweak symmetry breaking",
    "is fulfilled by a naturally light higgs sector , and the discovery of the higgs boson with a relatively light mass @xmath13 @xcite could substantiate a little higgs model .",
    "general features of a composite higgs involve : i ) a scale of compositeness @xmath14 ; ii ) a hierarchy between the electroweak ( higgs vev @xmath15 ) and the compositeness scale , i.e. @xmath16 ; iii ) a higgs potential that is ( entirely or in part ) radiatively generated .",
    "different composite higgs models differ , essentially , on which and how many pieces in the potential are radiatively generated @xcite .",
    "little higgs models , in particular , are characterized generically by a loop - level generated mass ( that accords with its smallness ) and a tree - level generated quartic coupling .",
    "hence some tuning has to be introduced in order to balance both scales .",
    "in addition they contain new little \" particles , with masses around the scale of compositeness @xmath17 , that cancel one - loop quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass from standard model loops .",
    "one expects the need of a more fundamental theory , an ultraviolet completion , at a scale of @xmath18 where the description given by the lh models may become strongly coupled .",
    "although the little higgs mechanism can be implemented in different ways giving diverse models , these can be grouped into two types that share many common phenomenological features .",
    "lh models can be categorized into two classes depending on the way the standard model @xmath19 group is inserted @xcite : _ product group _ models where the electroweak group arises from the diagonal breaking of a product gauge group , as the littlest higgs @xcite , and _ simple _ models when the sm @xmath19 embedding happens through the breaking of a simple group , as is the case of the slh @xcite .",
    "a common feature to all lh models is their extended spectrum of gauge bosons and fermions , playing the latter a crucial role in the implementation of the collective symmetry breaking and , hence , in the cancellation of non - wished ultraviolet divergences .",
    "moreover they become an important asset as possible signals to discern between different models .",
    "lhc higgs data have already challenged predictions of the lh models @xcite and it was soon pointed out the existence of a possible stress with the first measurements of diphoton decays of the higgs boson .",
    "however later measurements of this process @xcite have eased the tension .    in the next section",
    "we collect , for completeness , the characteristics , properties and features , of the slh model . in section iii",
    "we proceed to the explain the calculation of the lfv hadron tau decays @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 in the slh model .",
    "we will also detail the procedure of hadronization .",
    "the results and their discussion will be postponed to section iv . finally the conclusions of our work are given in section v.",
    "the slh model @xcite is constructed by embedding the electroweak sm gauge group @xmath20 into a @xmath21 gauge group . the collective symmetry breaking procedure",
    "is realized through two complex scalar fields @xmath22 , which are triplets under @xmath23 : @xmath24 their initial scalar potential has a @xmath25 ^ 2 $ ] global symmetry that breaks spontaneously to @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] , with corresponding vacuum expectation values given by @xmath27 and yielding five nambu - goldstone bosons from each scalar .",
    "meanwhile the diagonal subgroup of the @xmath25 ^ 2 $ ] , i.e. @xmath28 , that has been gauged , breaks down to @xmath20 via the @xmath29 vacuum condensates . here",
    "the hypercharge group @xmath30 is identified with the unbroken linear combination of the @xmath31 and the eighth generator of @xmath23 .",
    "notice that this model has no custodial symmetry @xcite ( see below in this section ) .",
    "the scalar multiplets are given by a non - linear sigma model .",
    "they include the sm higgs as well as new goldstone bosons : @xmath32 here @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi12 ] ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 carry the goldstone bosons .",
    "the term @xmath39 can be rotated away through a @xmath21 gauge transformation ( unitary gauge ) and @xmath40 that includes the complex higgs doublet @xmath41 and the scalar singlet @xmath42 . upon electroweak symmetry breaking we will have @xmath43 being @xmath44 the sm higgs and @xmath45 .",
    "hence , in the unitary gauge , the three @xmath46 degrees of freedom can be gauged away .",
    "they provide the longitudinal components of the sm gauge bosons .",
    "the scalar singlet @xmath42 plays no role in the following ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider the fermion sector .",
    "the sm doublets of leptons and quarks have to be expanded into @xmath23 left - handed triplets where new fermions also appear and the corresponding @xmath23 singlet right - handed fermions are also added :    - .",
    "there is a new heavy neutrino @xmath47 but there is no right - handed light neutrino . as a consequence light neutrinos",
    "have no mass : @xmath48 with @xmath49 the family number , and the superscript indicates the @xmath50 hypercharge @xmath51 .    - .",
    "contrarily to @xmath19 , @xmath52 triplets are not free from the triangle anomaly .",
    "this does not affect the sm and a possible ultraviolet completion could fix the problem ; however we prefer to keep the slh model free of anomalies .",
    "a solution arises by treating asymmetrically the first two families from the third one @xcite : while the latter is put into the * 3 * @xmath23 representation , the first two generations of quarks are put into @xmath53 representations .",
    "this is called the _ anomaly - free _ embedding scheme for the three families : @xmath54 where , again , the superscripts indicate the value of @xmath51 . a heavy fermion , namely @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , has been added to each family .",

    "observe that as the sm sector is embedded naturally into the larger group , the corresponding gauge couplings of the latter are given altogether by the known sm parameters .",
    "the @xmath23 gauge bosons read : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the gell - mann matrices .",

    "the masses of the new gauge bosons arise from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the underlying @xmath25 ^ 2 $ ] global symmetry and are , accordingly , proportional to the high scale @xmath14 .",
    "for instance : @xmath71 the quadratic couplings of the higgs with one heavy and one sm gauge boson induce , after the electroweak symmetry breaking , a mixing between them . in the slh model",

    "( [ eq : dcov ] ) .",
    "the gauge - quark sector is more complicated because of the anomaly - free embedding structure .",

    "the yukawa sector of the slh model collects the structure of flavour of the theory .",
    "the lepton masses are generated by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 are @xmath23 indices , and @xmath89 are generation indices .",
    "notice that @xmath90 has been taken diagonal .",
    "however @xmath91 does not need to be aligned .",
    "upon diagonalization of the latter , the redefined fields of the light leptons @xmath92 , for @xmath93 , get a definite mass . by expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukal ] ) one also observes a mixing term between heavy and light neutrinos .",
    "we separate them by rotating the left - handed sector only and , up to @xmath94 , the physical states for the neutrinos are : @xmath95 where @xmath96 the heavy neutrino masses are given by @xmath97 .",
    "yukawa quark couplings are rather involved due to the mixing between the heavy little \" quarks and the sm ones ( we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed account ) . as in this article",
    "we are only interested in lepton flavour violating processes we will assume , in the following , no flavour mixing in the quark sector .",
    "accordingly the heavy - light mixing will stay within each family .",
    "the proper redefinition of the physical ( massive ) and left - handed fields is given by : @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 quarks .",
    "the mixing parameters @xmath102 are at least @xmath103 ( their complete expressions are given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while @xmath104 are , naturally , @xmath105 .",
    "as it was pointed out before the slh model has no custodial symmetry , i.e. there can not be a @xmath106 embedded into the @xmath20 to which the @xmath28 breaks spontaneously .",
    "however the @xmath107 ( or equivalently the @xmath57 oblique parameter ) only gets corrections at @xmath94 and the breaking of the symmetry is very small .",
    "it is worthwhile to build a little higgs model preserving custodial symmetry and generating a collective higgs quartic coupling free of quadratic divergences @xcite .",
    "a solution has been put forward in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the study of lfv in the slh model has been carried out previously in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath3 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 conversion in nuclei where considered . here",
    "we intend to apply the model for the study of lfv tau decays into hadrons , namely @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath110 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is short for a pseudoscalar ( vector ) meson , that are of interest for belle ii and future flavour factories .",
    "the procedure goes as follows .",
    "we have two different scales in the model : the vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs , @xmath15 , and the vacuum expectation value of the triplets under @xmath23 , @xmath14 .",
    "evidently we expect @xmath111 and in the limit @xmath112 the effects of lfv should reduce to the negligible ones of the sm ( commented in the introduction ) .",
    "therefore we organize the calculation of the lfv amplitudes of the widths as an expansion in @xmath76 and we keep just the leading @xmath94 result . our goal is to determine the amplitudes of the @xmath113 where @xmath114 quarks and , afterwards , proceed to hadronize the corresponding quark bilinears . for this latter step we will employ the tools given by chiral symmetry .",
    "lfv decays in the slh model arise at one - loop level and they are driven by the presence of the little \" heavy neutrinos @xmath115 in connivance with the rotation of light lepton fields @xmath116 .",
    "there are two generic topologies participating in this amplitude : i ) penguin - like diagrams , namely @xmath117 , followed by @xmath118 and ii ) box diagrams .",
    "the calculation is obviously finite at this leading order . in principle",
    "there should be also a penguin - like contribution with a higgs boson , i.e. @xmath119",
    ". however the coupling of the higgs to the light quarks , @xmath120 , has an intrinsic suppression due to the mass of the quarks and , therefore , we do not take this into account .",
    "in fact we will assume that light quarks are massless along all our calculation , and we will also neglect the muon mass .",
    "it has to be mentioned , however , that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that a one - loop higgs generated gluon operator does not suffer of the light - quark mass suppression and could give a sizeable contribution .",
    "this would be independent of the lfv model employed .",
    "although we are interested in the signatures specific to the slh model and we do not include that gluon contribution in this article , we think that this would require a separate analysis following up on our work here .",
    "hence the full amplitude will be given by the sum of all contributions : @xmath121    we will use the unitary gauge . as it is well known , the number of feynman diagrams is much reduced in this gauge because the only fields participating in the dynamics are the physical ones .",
    "the price to pay is that the cancellation of divergences becomes rather intricate .",
    "while in the t hooft - feynman gauge , for instance , penguin and box diagrams are separately finite , in the unitary gauge they are not and the physical result is postponed until the final addition of all contributions .    along the calculation",
    "we do a consistent expansion on the squared transfer momenta , i.e. @xmath122 over both the squared masses proportional to the @xmath14 scale ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) and the sm gauge bosons .",

    "we would like to turn now to comment a property of our calculation in the slh model .",
    "this is related with the relative weight of the different contributions that have been specified in section  iii .",
    "supersymmetric scenarios seem to indicate that , in the t hooft - feynman gauge , box diagrams provide negligible contributions in comparison with photon - penguin diagrams in leptonic processes @xcite .",
    "however it has been pointed out that this might not be the case in other models .",
    "for instance , in the littlest higgs model with t - parity both contributions are of the same order in @xmath206 @xcite and the same happens in the same purely leptonic processes within the slh model @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding in lfv hadron decays of the tau lepton within this later model , that we have studied in this article , we do not reach the same conclusion , at least in the unitary gauge . in figure  [ fig:8 ]",
    "we show the dependence on @xmath14 for the different contributions for @xmath207 . it can be seen that in hadron decays photon - penguin diagrams dominate over the rest of contributions .",
    "box diagrams give a small input although one can see that they interfere destructively with the photon ones .",
    "meanwhile the @xmath72- and @xmath73-penguin diagrams are negligible . in figure  [ fig:9 ]",
    "we plot the analogous comparison for @xmath208 where , obviously , there are not photon - penguin diagrams contributing .",
    "then box diagrams give the bulk of the branching ratio though with a non - negligible positive interference of the z - penguin contribution . in the lower plot of figure  [ fig:7 ] we noticed the high correlation between both @xmath207 and @xmath208 decays .",
    "this seems eye - catching because , as we have seen , both processes are dominated by different contributions : the first by the photon - penguin diagrams and the second by the boxes . however , as it can be seen , the parameters of the model and the hadronization establish a correlation between hadron processes that is not so apparent in @xmath194 , for instance .",
    "dependence on the scale of compositeness @xmath14 for @xmath209 showing the relative weights of the different contributions in the unitary gauge .",
    "normalization and input as in figure  [ fig:4 ] . ]",
    "dependence on the scale of compositeness @xmath14 for @xmath208 showing the relative weights of the different contributions in the unitary gauge .",
    "normalization and input as in figure  [ fig:4 ] . ]    as commented in section  iii we did not include higgs - penguin contribution on the basis that their couplings to light quarks are suppressed by their masses . in refs .  @xcite it was pointed out that a higgs could couple , through a loop of heavy quarks , to two gluons able to hadronize into one or two pseudoscalars and , at least in the latter case , give a relevant contribution comparable with the one of the photon - penguin amplitude .",
    "this is indeed a two - loop calculation in our framework and we have not considered to sum this addition . in our opinion",
    "this could change our results for a factor not larger than @xmath151 and therefore it would not change our main conclusions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was indicated that , at least in lfv decays of the muon into leptons and muon conversion in nuclei , the behaviour of the slh model is very similar to the littlest higgs with t - parity .",
    "if that assertion could be extended to the hadron decays of the tau lepton , as it seems rather sensible , we would definitely conclude that little higgs models predict a high suppression for these channels .",
    "it is now the turn of the flavour factories to clarify this issue .",
    "we have analysed lfv decays of the tau lepton into one pseudoscalar , one vector or two pseudoscalar mesons in the simplest little higgs model , characterized as a composite higgs model with a simple group @xmath28 and with a scale of compositeness @xmath210 were a feature of collective symmetry breaking occurs providing a light higgs boson .",
    "this model has interesting features like a reduced extension of the spectrum of gauge bosons and fermions over the sm ones and a small number of unknown parameters .",
    "in contrast the model has no custodial symmetry , though its lack does not bring large unwanted corrections . for the inclusion of the quark sector we use",
    "the _ anomaly - free _ embedding that does not need the role of an ultraviolet completion in order to cancel a gauge anomaly in the extended sector .",
    "the model has already been confronted with lhc data @xcite and keeps its strength waiting for more precise determinations .",
    "lepton flavour violating decays are , due to their high suppression in the sm , an excellent benchmark where to look for new physics .",
    "though present upper bounds are very tight both in @xmath3 and other muonic decays into leptons where one could expect that lfv , if any , will be first observed , tau physics provide the unique property of being the only lepton decaying into hadrons and , consequently , offer a new scenario that , moreover , has been thoroughly explored in b - factories like babar and belle .",
    "present upper limits on branching ratios of the studied processes are of @xmath211 and future flavour factories , like belle ii , could lower those up to two orders of magnitude",
    ". therefore the study of lfv hadron decays of the tau lepton is all - important in order to face the near future experimental status .",
    "we have considered the study of several hadron decays of the tau lepton , i.e. @xmath212 decays where @xmath1 is short for a pseudoscalar meson and @xmath2 for a vector one . the leading amplitude for these decays , in the slh model ,",
    "is given by a one - loop contribution dynamically driven by the mixing of the light charged leptons , @xmath7 and @xmath213 with the heavy little \" neutrinos of the model .",
    "we have carried out the calculation at leading order in the @xmath76 expansion and our results are @xmath94 .",
    "for the numerical determination of the branching ratios we have considered previous constraints on the input constants of the model , although we have allowed their variation rather prodigally in order to convey the generic pattern of the predictions .",
    "hence we have studied the dependence of the branching ratios on the relevant parameters of the model .",
    "we conclude that , for the most natural settings , the predictions of the slh model for theses processes are , typically , between 4 and 8 orders of magnitude smaller than present upper bounds and , therefore , out of reach for the foreseen next flavour factories .",
    "an observation of any of these decays by belle ii not only would signal new physics but also would falsify the slh model .",
