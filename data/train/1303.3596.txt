    "it is a classical fact that one may get a canonical embedded resolution of it by successively blowing up the singular points of the strict transform of @xmath5 .",
    "we say that the number of blow - ups needed to arrive at the minimal embedded resolution is the _ blow - up complexity _ of @xmath5 .",
    "this notion is not to be confused with that of _ resolution complexity _ introduced by l and oka in @xcite .",

    "milnor number_.    we were surprized to discover that , _ if one fixes a blow - up complexity @xmath1 , then the maximal multiplicity is equal to the @xmath1-th fibonacci number @xmath3 _ , and that _ there are exactly two topological types realizing this maximum _",
    "( recall that the _ fibonacci sequence _ @xmath8 is defined by the initial conditions @xmath9 and the recursive relation @xmath10 , for all @xmath11 ) .",
    "one may discriminate these two multiplicity - maximizing types using the milnor number : _ one of them is the unique topological type with maximal milnor number among plane branches of blow - up complexity @xmath1 _ ( see theorem [ theo : mult ] ) .",
    "this motivated us to study in more detail the set @xmath12 of embedded topological types of plane branches with blow - up complexity @xmath1 .",
    "we discovered a second appearance of the fibonacci numbers : _ the cardinal of @xmath12 is equal to @xmath13 _ ( see theorem [ cardtypes ] ) .",
    "but @xmath12 should not be thought only as a set : we found out a natural partial order on @xmath12 which makes it a _ distributive lattice _",
    ", that is , any two elements have an infimum and a supremum , each one of these operations being distributive with respect to the other one ( see proposition [ distrlat ] ) .",
    "this partial order has an absolute maximum , which is the topological type of maximal milnor number alluded to before .",
    "there is also an absolute minimum , which may be characterized as the unique topological type of blow - up complexity @xmath1 with multiplicity @xmath14 ( it is the simple singularity @xmath15 ) .",
    "this symmetry between the minimum and the maximum extends to a _",
    "duality _ on embedded topological types of plane branches : for each @xmath1 , there is an order - inverting involution on @xmath12 ( see definition [ def : dual ] ) .",
    "this involution is the _",
    "unique _ bijection of @xmath12 on itself which inverts the partial order ( see theorem [ uniqdual ] ) .",
    "the fibonacci numbers appear for a third time : _ there are @xmath4 self - dual topological types of complexity @xmath1 _ ( see proposition [ selfdual ] ) .",
    "as far as we know , no such lattice structures or duality were known before .",
    "see remark [ rem : notsame ] for some comments about the classical projective duality of plane curves .",
    "let us explain now our way to work with embedded topological types .",
    "there are various classical ways to encode them ; the most common ones are the sequence of characteristic newton - puiseux exponents and the weighted dual graph of the minimal embedded resolution .",
    "nevertheless , here we describe structures on @xmath12 which we discovered and we believe are most clearly understandable using what was , historically speaking , the first graphical encoding of the topological type of a plane branch : its _ enriques diagram_.    an enriques diagram associated to a branch is a decorated graph homeomorphic to an interval , whose vertices are labeled by the infinitely near points appearing during the canonical process of embedded resolution by point blow - ups . by enriques convention , the edges are either _ curved _ or _ straight _ , and moreover one tells if at the junction point of two successive straight edges the diagram is broken or not : we speak then about _ breaking _ versus _ neutral _ vertices ( see definition [ enriques ] ) .",
    "all our results are proved by studying carefully those decorations .",
    "for instance , the duality expresses itself most easily as a symmetry between curved edges and breaking vertices : note that both ends of a curved edge are neutral and both edges adjacent to a breaking vertex are straight .",
    "the reader who wants to get an overview of the structure of the paper may read the short introductory paragraphs of the various sections .",
    "the final remark [ rem : rinrem ] explains how we were led to discover our results .",
    "as we intend this paper to be understandable to both singularists and combinatorialists , we wrote a rather detailed section with basic material about infinitely near points and enriques diagrams ( section [ sec : enriques ] ) , which is standard in singularity theory , and another detailed section with basic material about partial order relations and lattices ( section [ sec : basic ] ) , which is standard in combinatorics .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a few words of explanation about our use of the term `` complexity '' . following matveev s convention in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , an invariant of a class of objects may be considered as a _ complexity measure _ if the set of isomorphism classes of objects with a given invariant is _",
    "finite_. our _ blow - up complexity _ satisfies this condition , as well as the _ milnor number _ , if we look at the embedded topological types of plane branches as objects .",
    "but the _ multiplicity _ or the _ resolution complexity _ of l and oka do not .",
    "in this section we recall basic vocabulary about infinitely near points , as well as the equivalent notions of _ enriques diagram _ and _ multiplicity sequence _ associated to a plane branch .",
    "the reader who is not familiar with the process of _ point blowing up _ and of the way its iteration leads to resolutions of plane curve singularities , may gain a lot of intuition as well as technical skills by consulting brieskorn and knrrer s book @xcite .",

    "we make an abuse of notation and we denote also by @xmath28 its strict transform in further blow - ups .    if @xmath30 , we say that @xmath31 is * proximate * to @xmath29 if @xmath32 , and we write @xmath33 .",

    "if a finite lattice admits an order - reversing bijection , such a bijection is not necessarily unique .",
    "for instance , as the reader may easily check , the diamond lattice of figure [ fig : nondistr ] has six such bijections . in this section",
    "we show that the duality @xmath297 defined in section [ sec : latt ] is the _",
    "unique _ bijection of @xmath12 which reverses the staircase partial order structure .",
    "the case @xmath373 is trivial , as @xmath374 has only one element @xmath375 . in the figures [ fig : fib - dual - c4 ] , [ fig : fib - dual - c5 ] and [ fig : fib - dual - c6 ]",
    "are represented the hasse diagrams of the lattices @xmath376 , @xmath377 and @xmath378 respectively .",
    "if an arrow goes from a diagram @xmath124 to a greater diagram @xmath142 , it is labeled by the unique element of @xmath379 .",
    "the diagrams which have a self - referencing arrow are the self - dual ones . near each diagram",
    "we indicate the corresponding initial multiplicity .        by lemma [ lem : stable ] ,",
    "the set @xmath263 of codes of enriques diagrams of complexity @xmath1 is a sublattice of @xmath262 .",
    "as this last lattice is distributive , we deduce that the first one has also this property . by the definition [ def : latstr ] of the staircase",
    "partial order relation , we conclude that @xmath276 is indeed a distributive lattice .          note that by proposition [ prop : canreal ] , the apparently `` complicated '' lattices @xmath276 are completely described up to lattice - isomorphisms by the much `` simpler '' posets @xmath380 . as results immediately from lemma [ lem : image ] , the elements of @xmath381 are :        [ corresp ] the bijection from @xmath246 to @xmath381 which sends each @xmath69 to @xmath387 , each @xmath388 to @xmath384 and @xmath109 to @xmath386 , transforms the code @xmath389 of an enriques diagram @xmath135 into the hereditary subset @xmath390 . therefore ,",
    "if one considers the poset structure @xmath391 inherited from @xmath380 by the previous bijection , its hasse diagram is as drawn in figure [ fig : hasse - irred ] and @xmath263 is exactly the set of hereditary subsets of @xmath246 .",
    "the statement about the hasse diagram is checked easily using the definition of the bijection .",
    "then one checks using lemma [ lem : image ] the statement about the correspondence between codes and hereditary subsets of @xmath380 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : fib - dual - irred ] is represented again the lattice of figure [ fig : fib - dual - c6 ] .",
    "this time , we have represented each element of the lattice @xmath378 through the associated hereditary subset of @xmath392 .",
    "each hereditary subset is represented as a set of discs at the vertices of the hasse diagram of @xmath392 .",
    "the sup - irreducible elements of @xmath378 , which correspond therefore to the elements of @xmath393 by the bijection defined in proposition [ corresp ] , are represented against a colored background .        by our definition of the map @xmath297 , it is equivalent to show the analogous property for the poset @xmath394 of codes of the enriques diagrams of complexity @xmath1 and the corresponding involution , which we denote again by @xmath297 ( see definition [ def : dual ] ) .",
    "assume that there is another order - reversing bijection @xmath395 of @xmath263 .",
    "then @xmath396 is an automorphism of this poset . in particular",
    ", it restricts to an automorphism of the subposet @xmath380 of its sup - irreducible elements ( see definition [ def : infirr ] ) .    by proposition [ corresp ] , this gives an automorphism of the directed graph of figure [ fig : hasse - irred ] .",
    "as @xmath397 is the only vertex from which starts only one edge , it is fixed by this automorphism .",
    "looking then at the distance to this vertex in the hasse diagram , one sees that all vertices are fixed .",
    "[ rem : rinrem ] we discovered the results of this paper by thinking about the problem of _ adjacency of singularities_. a basic remark is that if the combinatorial type @xmath274 of a plane branch appears on the generic fibers of a one parameter deformation of a plane branch of combinatorial type @xmath275 ( one says then that they are _ adjacent _ ) , then @xmath399 .",
    "that is why we decided to understand the behaviour of the initial multiplicity @xmath86 on the set of combinatorial types of plane branches .",
    "we started our study by restricting to combinatorial types of fixed blow - up complexity .",
    "we checked whether the initial multiplicity was increasing for a slightly different definition of straightening operator than the one of definition [ def : operators ] , in which the neighboring edges are treated symmetrically .",
    "that is , if any one of them is straight , then the new straight edge is aligned with it . if one draws then an arrow from each enriques diagram to every diagram obtained from it by one of the two types of operators , one obtains precisely the hasse diagrams of the staircase partial orders ! on that of @xmath400 ( see figure [ fig : fib - dual - c6 ] ) , the duality jumped to our eyes , which led us to prove that it was a general phenomenon .",
    "one may also see on figure [ fig : fib - dual - c6 ] that the initial multiplicity is not necessarily increasing for the staircase partial order on @xmath400 .",
    "in fact , and we leave this as an exercise for the reader , it is never increasing on @xmath276 , for @xmath401 .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that the lattice structure , the duality and the straightening and breaking operators will help describing the pairs @xmath402 of combinatorial types of adjacent singularities ."
