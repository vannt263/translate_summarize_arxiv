    "it is well known that a charged particle can be accelerated resonantly by a wave along the phase front in the presence of weak dc magnetic field @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this so - called surfatron acceleration was described in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 perpendicular to the wave vector @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it was shown that speeds of the order of the @xmath2 velocity can be attained for nonrelativistic particles , @xmath3 being the wave electric field .",
    "a more general case , with the angle between @xmath0 and @xmath1 being arbitrary , is more complicated , and it is only recently that the underlying physics was made transparent , namely , via hamiltonian geometrical arguments in ref .",
    "however , those arguments do not immediately apply to electrostatic waves , which also could drive surfatron acceleration in plasma ( e.g.,ion acceleration in the lower - hybrid frequency range ) .",
    "hence , an operational understanding of the surfatron effect in oblique electrostatic waves is yet to be developed .    here",
    ", we study this effect in application to nonrelativistic particles .",
    "we proceed like in ref .",
    "@xcite , but without using the hamiltonian formalism explicitly , striving to render the qualitative picture even more transparent . for the particular case when @xmath1 is perpendicular to @xmath0 , the corresponding result of ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered .",
    "otherwise , acceleration _ along _ magnetic field is possible , like in ref .",
    "@xcite ; yet , the particle dynamics in an electrostatic wave can be qualitatively different from that in an electromagnetic wave ( sec .  [",
    "sec : single ] ) .",
    "we also find that , in plasma , surfatron mechanism can , in principle , produce an average parallel current , even when the wave frequency is much larger than the gyrofrequency and the wave phase velocity is much larger than particle initial velocities .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] , we introduce basic equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] , we identify and explain the possible types of particle trajectories . in sec .",

    "[ fig : geom](a ) ] , @xmath27 with the center being at @xmath28 . here @xmath29 the radius determined by initial conditions , @xmath30 is the wave longitudinal phase velocity , and @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 below , we will assume , for clarity , that @xmath33 , so , in particular , @xmath34 .",

( [ eq : theta ] ) automatically implies @xmath41 as well . ] in this case , the particle nonlinear dynamics is quasiadiabatic and can be understood as follows .",
    "first , let us consider the characteristic features of the two types of oscillations , employing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ddpx ] ) and ( [ eq : ddpsi ] ) .",
    "for the motion with @xmath42 , use that @xmath43 , so one obtains @xmath44 ; hence , @xmath45 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath46-oscillations is larger , namely , @xmath47 [ eq .  ( [ eq : px ] ) ] ; yet still @xmath48 . also , eq .  ( [ eq : pz ] ) yields @xmath49 for the quiver part of @xmath50 ; hence , @xmath51 . assuming the wave is weak , oscillations at frequencies of the order of @xmath52 are thus of small amplitude in @xmath9-space .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 ; then , at @xmath55 , one gets @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the characteristic electric - drift velocity @xcite .",
    "since @xmath58 , oscillations at frequencies of the order of @xmath18 can be of large amplitude in @xmath9-space .    since high - frequency oscillations of @xmath59 are negligible ( albeit not so for @xmath46 and @xmath60 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddpsi ] ) yields that the dynamics in space @xmath61 is similar to that of a nonlinear pendulum with a bias torque .",
    "hence , two regimes are possible : ( i ) if @xmath62 , there is no local equilibrium .",
    "thus , all trajectories are untrapped ; specifically , @xmath63 increases or decreases indefinitely , resulting in that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddpx ] ) averages to zero on time scales of the particle gyromotion",
    ". then the wave has little effect on the particle dynamics , which thus represents ( weakly perturbed ) larmor rotation with frequency @xmath18 in the plane @xmath64 , with @xmath50 approximately fixed .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath65 , most of trajectories are still untrapped . however ,",
    "if a particle is close enough to the resonance ( @xmath66 ) , it can be trapped near one of the local equilibria , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is integer .",
    "[ we assume @xmath69 ; otherwise , the equilibria would be @xmath70 . ] since the parameters of the potential well for @xmath63 change on the time scale large compared to that of the bounce oscillations , the phase area @xmath71 captured by the trajectory in @xmath72 is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "hence , the particle remains trapped as long as @xmath73 stays less than the separatrix value @xmath74 , or , equivalently , while @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the function inverse to @xmath77 .      since @xmath63 of a trapped particle oscillates around a fixed value , averaging of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpsi ] ) over its fast motion yields that such a particle is bound to the `` resonance plane ''  @xmath78 in @xmath9-space [ fig .  [ fig : geom](a ) ] , namely , @xmath79 which passes through the center @xmath80 of each sphere @xmath26 .",
    "the intersection of @xmath26 and @xmath78 is a circle @xmath81 with the same center @xmath80 and radius @xmath29 , yielding that @xmath59 is bounded from above by @xmath29 .",
    "hence , if @xmath82 , the particle is trapped forever . if @xmath83 or @xmath84 , then detrapping occurs at @xmath85 . in particular , for most deeply trapped particles , the latter corresponds to detrapping at @xmath86 .",
    "( this is the surfatron acceleration discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where zero @xmath73 and @xmath31 are taken , also rendering @xmath29 infinite . )",
    "hence , the types of trajectories that can exist in the system are as follows .        _ type a. _     particles can be untrapped forever and rotate adiabatically in the plane @xmath64 with frequency @xmath18 ; @xmath50 remains approximately fixed then [ fig .",
    "[ fig : traj](a ) ] . for that",
    ", the particle larmor orbit @xmath87 must not intersect @xmath78 ; i.e.,its radius @xmath88 must satisfy @xmath89 , where @xmath90    _ type b. _     particles can be trapped forever and rotate adiabatically along circles @xmath81 in the plane @xmath78 , specifically around the equilibrium at @xmath80 and in the direction determined by the sign of @xmath18 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : traj](b ) ] . the frequency of these oscillations in the limit of small @xmath73 equals @xmath91 , as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ddpx ] ) and ( [ eq : ddpsi ] ) after linearization for @xmath92 .",
    "_ type c. _     particles can undergo nonadiabatic dynamics which is a mixture of trapped and untrapped motion [ fig .",
    "[ fig : traj](c ) ] .",
    "suppose a particle starts out on a larmor circle like of type  a yet with @xmath93 .",
    "then there are two intersections of @xmath87 and @xmath78 , at some @xmath94 , where the resonance condition ( [ eq : xi ] ) is satisfied ; we will call those resonant points @xmath95 .",
    "there , the particle crosses the separatrix in @xmath72 and thus has a probability of hopping on the trapped orbit @xmath81 , if arriving at the appropriate phase ; namely , required is [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : ddpsi ] ) ] @xmath96 which also implies that @xmath97 is needed .",
    "then the particle would have to continue along @xmath81 toward smaller @xmath98 from , say , @xmath99 and toward larger @xmath98 from @xmath100 .",
    "( remember that the direction of motion along @xmath81 is determined by the sign of @xmath18 only . )",
    "yet notice that the phase area @xmath73 that is captured at @xmath95 equals @xmath101 @xcite , and thus further increase of @xmath98 would result in immediate untrapping .",
    "thus , actual trapping of an initially untrapped particle can occur at @xmath99 but not at @xmath100 .    hence , the overall corresponding motion consists of the gyromotion ( at angular velocity @xmath18 ) which is interrupted incidentally at @xmath99 ; then the particle proceeds to @xmath100 along @xmath81 ( at angular velocity of about @xmath91 ) and gets untrapped again , returning to the _ same _ larmor orbit .",
    "interestingly , for the type of waves considered in ref .",
    "@xcite realized is a very different scenario .",
    "specifically , only large @xmath59 ( rather than small @xmath59 , in our notation ) are allowed there after trapping , thus resulting in particle jumping between _ two _ larmor orbits with the same @xmath88 .",
    "_ type d. _     particles can undergo nonadiabatic gyromotion [ @xmath93 ] with @xmath103 .",
    "then , trapping is impossible , but multiple scatterings off the resonance at @xmath94 can cause diffusion along @xmath26 .",
    "eventually , such trajectories can fill out the entire subset of @xmath26 that satisfies @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "this subset is further called @xmath104 and has a characteristic pitted - olive shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbar ] .",
    "accessible for particles through diffusion along @xmath26 . ]",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath26 along @xmath50 with respect to the origin can be used to generate an average flow , or current , parallel to @xmath0 via surfatron acceleration of particles from an initially isotropic distribution .",
    "this is seen as follows .    _ ring distribution . _",
    "   first , consider an ensemble of particles initially occupying a ring @xmath105 in @xmath9-space , with some @xmath106 and homogeneous distribution over @xmath63 and @xmath107 , where @xmath107 is introduced via @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath110 , then @xmath105 does not intersect @xmath78 , so all particles are of type  a and will approximately retain their initial @xmath111 , yielding no added current .",
    "suppose now that @xmath112 , so @xmath105 intersects @xmath78 at some @xmath94 , corresponding to @xmath113 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : geom](b ) ] .",
    "then , trajectories of other types are realized , and current can be generated .",
    "in particular , at @xmath103 , the current is produced through diffusion , for all trajectories are of type  d and thus eventually cover the entire @xmath104 , changing the average velocity  by @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath97 , the acceleration is ballistic and takes less time ( of the order of @xmath115 ) .",
    "below , we assume this latter mechanism and discuss it in more detail .    clearly , for given @xmath116 , the maximum added current is generated when @xmath117 , i.e.,when @xmath105 is tangent to @xmath78 , so @xmath118 [ fig .  [",
    "fig : geom](c ) ] .",
    "this is because all trapped particles are either of type  b or remain on @xmath105 forever , so @xmath119 for _ each _ particle in this case . at larger @xmath120 ,",
    "some of trapped particles are of type  c. they will spend some time in the region @xmath121 , thus reducing the current somewhat .",
    "still , even in this case one can show that @xmath122 , as also seen numerically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] ) .     by tracing individual trajectories of @xmath123 particles ( for each @xmath120 ) , which were initially distributed in @xmath9-space over a ring @xmath105 with fixed @xmath124 homogeneously in @xmath63 and @xmath107 .",
    "shown is a snapshot at @xmath125 , for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] . at @xmath126 , @xmath105 does not intersect @xmath78",
    ", so there is no current . at @xmath127 ,",
    "the current is maximal , because all trapped particles are of type  b. at @xmath128 , particles of type  c appear , reducing @xmath129 ; yet , the latter still remains positive . ]    _ general case .",
    "_     to assess the current that could be produced in plasma ( i.e.,by particles that initially occupy a three - dimensional volume , rather than a ring , in @xmath9-space ) , one only needs to integrate over the contributions yielded by each @xmath130 .",
    "since each @xmath105 produces @xmath114 , the total added current will also be nonzero .",
    "remarkably , even particles with @xmath131 will contribute here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] ) .",
    "this makes surfatron acceleration very different from traditional current drive schemes @xcite , because , in the considered range ( @xmath41 ) , those are bound to rely on cherenkov resonance .",
    "finally , notice that electromagnetic waves of the type discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite can also drive current similarly .",
    "in fact , since no particles attain negative @xmath132 in that case ( assuming @xmath133 and except in the diffusive regime ) , the total added current may be even larger .",
    "however , the actual amount of current that can be produced through surfatron acceleration in plasma is yet to be calculated .",
