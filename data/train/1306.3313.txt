    "ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices have various applications in many fields , including the quantum simulation of many - body systems and the realization of quantum computation and high - precision atomic clock  @xcite .",
    "so far most of the experiments have been implemented in ground bands ( @xmath2-bands ) of optical lattices .",
    "recently , ultracold gases in the excited bands of optical lattices attract many attentions .",
    "it is proposed that many interesting many - body phenomena , e.g. , supersolid quantum phases in cubic lattices  @xcite , quantum stripe ordering in triangular lattices  @xcite , orbital degeneracy  @xcite can appear in the ultracold atoms in the excited - band states .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath3- and @xmath4-band physics in optical lattices have remained experimentally unexplored , except the bipartite square optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "a common concern for the research of excited - band physics of ultracold gas in an optical lattice is how to rapidly load the atoms into the high energy bands without excitation or heating .",
    "so far several experimental techniques have been developed for preparing ultracold atoms in the high energy bands .",
    "these techniques include : ( i ) the coherent manipulation of vibrational bands by stimulated raman transitions  @xcite , ( ii ) using a moving lattice to load a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) into a excited - band  @xcite , ( iii ) the population swapping technique for selectively exciting the atoms into the @xmath5-band  @xcite or @xmath4-band  @xcite of a bipartite square optical lattice .",
    "it is pointed out that , these approaches are designed to transfer the atoms from the @xmath2-band to the excited bands .",
    "namely , to create an ultracold gas in the excited band of the optical lattice with these approaches , one needs to first load the atoms into the @xmath2-band . with the widely - used adiabatic loading approach ,",
    "such a process takes several tens of milliseconds .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a method for effective preparation of a weakly - interacting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the high energy bands of an optical lattice .",
    "this scheme is based on our previous work for the rapid loading of bec into the ground state of an optical lattice via a standing - wave laser pulse sequence  @xcite . with our method",
    ", the bec can be _ directly _ transferred from the ground state of the weak harmonic trap into the excited band of the optical lattice with a non - adiabatic process , which can normally be completed within several tens of microseconds . furthermore , in our scheme the bec can be prepared in either a single excited - band bloch state or a coherent superposition of bloch states in different bands with the same quasi - momentum . as a demonstration , we experimentally realize the effective preparation of a @xmath0rb bec into a @xmath1-band state , and the coherent superposition of @xmath1-band and @xmath2-band states of an one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice .",
    "the effectiveness of our approach is further verified by the observations of the atomic rabi oscillations between states with different single - atom momentum .",
    "as shown below , the fidelities of the preparation process in our experiments are as high as 97%-99% .    as an application of our method",
    ", we experimentally investigate the decay process of the @xmath0rb bec , which is rapidly loaded in the @xmath1-band of the 1d optical lattice .",
    "it is well known that , when the ultracold atoms are prepared in the excited - band state of an optical lattice , they can decay to the states in the lower bands via inter - atomic collision . for the ultracold gas prepared around the lowest - energy points of high energy bands ,",
    "the lifetime of the gas is mainly determined by the collisional decay .",
    "such a decay process was experimentally observed by n. katz _",
    "_ in a moving optical lattice  @xcite and theoretically studied with a perturbative calculation by the same authors  @xcite . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , there is still lack of a first - principle calculation for the collisional - decay rate . in this paper , based on the scattering theory ,",
    "we provide a first - principle calculation for the collisional - decay process of ultracold gases in the excited bands , and obtain the analytical expression of the decay rate .",
    "we compare our theoretical result and the experimental observations , and find great consistency .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our method for effective preparation of bec in the excited - band states .",
    "our experiment for the preparation of the bec of @xmath0rb atoms is shown in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we analytically calculate the rate of the collisional decay of atoms in the @xmath1-band state , and compare our result with the experimental observations .",
    "the main results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "v , while some details of our calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "now we introduce our approach for rapidly preparing a bec in the excited bands of an optical lattice . for simplicity , in this section we only consider the case with 1d optical lattice .",
    "our method introduced here can be straightforwardly generalized to the systems with two- or three - dimensional lattice .    in the ultracold gas of single - component bosonic atoms ,",
    "a 1d optical lattice can be created by two counter - propagating laser beams . in the presence of the optical lattice ,",
    "the single - atom hamiltonian in the @xmath6-direction is given by @xmath7@xmath8with @xmath9 and @xmath10 the single - atom mass and momentum in the @xmath6-direction , respectively . here",
    "@xmath11 is the depth of the optical lattice and @xmath12 is the lattice constant .",
    "according to the bloch s theorem , the eigen - state of @xmath13 can be expressed as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the index of the energy band , and @xmath16 the quasi - momentum . here",
    "the periodic bloch function @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 using this property , it can be easily proved that bloch state @xmath19 is the superposition of the plane waves @xmath20 , with @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "namely , @xmath19 can be re - expressed as@xmath23where @xmath24 is the eigen - state of @xmath25 with eigen - value @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the superposition coefficient .    as shown in fig",
    ".  [ system ] , we suppose that before the preparation process , there is no optical lattice in our system , and the atoms are condensed in the single - atom ground state of the weak harmonic trap .",
    "we further approximate such a state to be @xmath28 with zero momentum .",
    "our purpose is to prepare the condensed atom in a given superposition state @xmath29according to eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , @xmath30 can be expressed as the superposition of the states @xmath31 , i.e. , we have @xmath32with @xmath33 .",
    "we first consider a simple case where @xmath30 is the superposition of the zero - quasi - momentum bloch states in the  even bands \" , i.e. , the case with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in that case , with our method the preparation process is accomplished via alternating cycles of switching on ( duty cycle ) and off ( off - duty cycle ) the optical lattice . in these duty cycles , the atom experiences spatial potential @xmath36 . such a potential can induce the transition between the states @xmath37 with different values of @xmath38 . in the off - duty cycle ,",
    "the atom is governed by the free - hamiltonian @xmath39 .",
    "thus , although there is no transition between different eigen - states of @xmath10 , these states can gain different phase factors .",
    "therefore , when the duty and off - duty cycles are alternately applied to the atoms at state @xmath28 , the atoms can be prepared to a superposition state of @xmath40 , i.e. , a state with the form in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "it is pointed out that , since the initial atomic momentum is zero and the quasi - momentum is conserved in both of the two cycles , in the preparation process the atomic state can only be the superposition of the zero - quasi - momentum states in different energy bands .",
    "finally , when all the duty and off - duty cycles are completed , we _",
    "instantaneously _ switch on the optical lattice , and then the atoms are loaded in the optical lattice .",
    "the above preparation approach can be mathematically described as follows .",
    "we assume the preparation process includes @xmath41 duty cycles and @xmath41 off - duty cycles , and the duration of the @xmath42th duty and off - duty cycle is @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . thus , after the preparation process , the atomic state would be @xmath45\\tau _ { l}}|p_{x}=0\\rangle .\\]]therefore , for a given target state @xmath30 , the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be determined via maximizing the fidelity @xmath48it is apparent that the value @xmath49 just describes the difference between the realistic atomic state @xmath50 after the preparation and the target state @xmath30 , i.e. , the error in the preparation process . when @xmath51 the atoms would be fully prepared in the state @xmath52 .",
    "it is pointed out that , for simplicity , here we assume the optical lattice has the same intensity @xmath53 in all the duty cycles . in the practical cases , if it is necessary , the optical - lattice intensity can also be treated as a control parameter , and take different values in different duty cycles .",
    "on the other hand , due to the selection rule , in the above process the potential of the optical lattices in the duty cycles can only couple the initial state @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the atoms can only be prepared into the states in these bands .",
    "when the target state @xmath30 is the superposition of the zero - quasi - momentum state in both  even bands \" and  odd bands \" ( i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath55 ) , the preparation process can also be accomplished via a sequence of laser pulses .",
    "nevertheless , here one should use the laser pulses of optical lattices moving with a velocity @xmath56 .",
    "namely , the potential created in the @xmath42th duty cycle should be proportional to @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the mechanism of the preparation approach can be easily understood in the reference moving with velocity @xmath58 . in that reference , the initial atomic state and the target state in eq .",

    ", the pules in the duty cycles can induce the transition between the states @xmath61 with different values of @xmath38 , and in the off - duty cycles these states can gain different phase factors .",
    "therefore , with the help of the sequence of the laser pules one can prepare the atoms in the target state .",
