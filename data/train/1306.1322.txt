    "this work is motivated by the availability of very large data sets to compare biological species , and by the current lack of asymptotic theory for the models that are used to draw inference from species comparisons .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the evolution of body size in mammals using data from 3473 species whose genealogical relationships are depicted by their family tree in figure  [ figmammaltree ] . even from this abundance of data , cooper and purvis found a lack of power to discriminate between a model of neutral evolution versus a model with natural selection .    .",
    "branch lengths indicate estimated diversification times on the horizontal axis .",
    "the cretaceous / tertiary mass extinction event marked the extinction of dinosaurs 65.5 million years ago .",
    "cooper and purvis ( @xcite ) used body mass data available for 77% of these species to infer the mode of evolution : neutral evolution ( bm ) versus natural selection ( ou ) . ]    to model neutral evolution , body size is assumed to follow a brownian motion ( bm ) along the branches of the tree , with observations made on present - day species at the tips of the tree . to model",
    "natural selection , body size is assumed to follow an ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) process , whose parameters represent a selective body size ( @xmath0 ) and a selection strength ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the lack of power observed by cooper and purvis suggests a nonstandard asymptotic behavior of the model parameters , which is the motivation for our work .",
    "and @xmath2 are parametrized in the ou model as a function of the tree distance @xmath3 between @xmath4 and @xmath2 and of the length @xmath5 of their shared path from the root .",
    "for instance , cooper and purvis ( @xcite ) considered body mass ( @xmath6 ) across 3473 mammal species ( @xmath7 ) . ]",
    "hierarchical autocorrelation , as depicted in the mammalian tree , arises whenever sampling units are related to each other through a vertical inheritance pattern , like biological species , genes in a gene family or human cultures . in the genealogical tree describing the relatedness between units , internal nodes represent ancestral unobserved units ( like species or human languages ) .",
    "branch lengths measure evolutionary time between branching events and define a distance between pairs of sampling units .",
    "this tree and its branch lengths can be used to parametrize the expected autocorrelation . for doing so ,",
    "the bm and the ou process are the two most commonly used models .",
    "they are defined as usual along each edge in the tree . at each internal node",
    ", descendant lineages inherit the value from the parent edge just prior to the branching event , thus ensuring continuity of the process .",
    "conditional of their starting value , each lineage then evolves independently of the sister lineages .",
    "bm evolution of the response variable ( or of error term ) along the tree results in normally distributed errors and in a covariance matrix governed by the tree , its branch lengths and a single parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the covariance between two tips @xmath4 and @xmath2 is simply @xmath9 , where @xmath5 is the shared time from the root of the tree to the tips ( figure  [ figfig1 ] ) . under the more complex ou process",
    ", changes toward a value @xmath0 are favored over changes away from this value , making the ou model appropriate to address biological questions about the presence or strength of natural selection .",
    "this model is defined by the following stochastic equation [ @xcite ] : @xmath10 where @xmath6 is the response variable ( such as body size ) , @xmath1 is the selection strength and @xmath11 is a bm process . in",
    "what follows , @xmath0 is called the `` mean '' even though it is not necessarily the expectation of the observations .",
    "it is the mean of the stationary distribution of the ou process , and it is the mean at the tips of the tree if the state at the root has mean @xmath0 . in the biology literature",
    ", @xmath0 is called the `` optimal '' value or `` adaptive optimum '' in reference to the action of natural selection , but this terminology could cause confusion here with likelihood optimization .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 measures the strength of the pull back to @xmath0 .",
    "high @xmath1 values result in a process narrowly distributed around @xmath0 , as expected under strong natural selection if the selective fitness of the trait is maximized at @xmath0 and drops sharply away from @xmath0 .",
    "simple mathematical models of natural selection at the level of individuals result in the ou process for the population mean [ @xcite ] . if @xmath12 , the ou process reduces to a bm with no pull toward any @xmath0 value , as if the trait under consideration does not affect fitness .",
    "while some applications focus on the presence of natural selection @xmath13 such as @xcite , other applications are interested in models where @xmath0 takes different values @xmath14 along different branches in the tree , to model different adaptation regimes [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "other applications assume a randomly varying @xmath0 along the tree , varying linearly with explanatory variables [ @xcite ] . in our work",
    ", we develop an asymptotic theory for the simple case of a constant @xmath0 over the whole tree .",
    "the covariance between two observed tips depends on how the unobserved response at the root is treated .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this value @xmath15 at the root is a random variable with the stationary gaussian distribution with mean @xmath0 and variance @xmath16 . with this assumption ,",
    "the observed process @xmath17 is gaussian with mean @xmath0 and variance matrix @xmath18 where @xmath3 is the tree distance between tips @xmath4 and @xmath2 , that is , the length of the path between @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the strength @xmath1 of natural selection provides a direct measure of the level of autocorrelation .",
    "if instead we condition on the response value @xmath15 at the root , the gaussian process has mean @xmath19 for tip @xmath4 and variance matrix @xmath20",
    "where , again , @xmath21 is the distance from the root to tip @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the shared time from the root to tips @xmath4 and @xmath2 ( figure  [ figfig1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to autocorrelation in spatial data or time series , hierarchical autocorrelation has been little considered in the statistics literature , even though tree models have been used in empirical studies for over 25 years .",
    "the usual asymptotic properties have mostly been taken for granted .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator of location parameters is not consistent under the bm tree model as the sample size grows indefinitely , proving that the basic consistency property should not be taken for granted .",
    "however , @xcite did not consider the more complex ou model , for which the ml estimator admits no analytical formula .",
    "in the spatial infill asymptotic framework when data are collected on a denser and denser set of locations within a fixed domain , @xmath8 can be consistently estimated , but @xmath1 can not under an ou spatial autocorrelation model in dimension @xmath22 [ @xcite ] .",
    "recently , @xmath1 has been proved to be consistently estimated under ou model when @xmath23 [ @xcite ] .",
    "we uncover here a similar asymptotic behavior under the ou tree model . just like in infill asymptotics",
    ", the tree structure implies that all sampling units may remain within a bounded distance of each other , and that the minimum correlation between any pair of observations does not go down to zero with indefinitely large sample sizes .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that some properties may be shared between these two autocorrelation frameworks . under infill asymptotics ,",
    "microergodic parameters can usually be consistently estimated [ see @xcite ] while nonmicroergodic parameters can not ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) .",
    "a parameter is microergodic when two different values for it lead to orthogonal distributions for the complete , asymptotic process [ @xcite ] .    in section  [ secmic ]",
    ", we prove that the mean @xmath0 is nonmicroergodic under the ou autocorrelation framework , and we provide a lower bound for the variance of the mle of @xmath0 .",
    "we also give a sufficient condition for the microergodicity of the ou covariance parameters @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( or @xmath24 ) based on the distribution of internal node ages . the microergodic covariance parameter under spatial infill asymptotics with ou autocorrelation , @xmath8 , is recovered as microergodic if @xmath25 is a limit point of the sequence of node ages , that is , with dense sampling near the tips .",
    "our condition for microergodicity suggests that some parameters may not be estimated at the same rate as others . in section  [ secrates ]",
    ", we illustrate this theoretically for a symmetric tree asymptotic framework , where we show that the reml estimator of @xmath1 converges at a slower rate than that of the generally microergodic parameter .",
    "we also illustrate that the ml estimate convergence rate of @xmath1 is slower than that of @xmath8 , through simulations on a large 4507-species real tree showing dense sampling near the tips .",
    "in most of this work , we only consider ultrametric trees , that is , trees in which the root is at equal distance from all the tips .",
    "this assumption is very natural for real data .",
    "we also focus on model ( [ eqrandomrootv ] ) , because the model matrix is not of full rank under model ( [ eqfixedrootv ] ) on an ultrametric tree .",
    "trees have already been used for various purposes in spatial statistics .",
    "when considering different resolution scales , the nesting of small spatial regions into larger regions can be represented by a tree .",
    "the data at a coarse scale for a given region is the average of the observations at a finer scale within this region .",
    "for instance , @xcite use this `` resolution '' tree structure to obtain consistent estimates at different scales , and otherwise use a traditional spatial correlation structure between locations at the finest level .",
    "in contrast , the tree structure in our model is the fundamental tool to model the correlation between sampling units , with no constraint between values at different levels .",
    "trees have also been used to capture the correlation among locations along a river network [ @xcite , and discussion ] .",
    "a  river network can be represented by a tree with the associated tree distance . to ensure that the covariance matrix is positive definite , moving average processes",
    "have been introduced , either averaging over upstream locations or over downstream locations , or both .",
    "there are two major differences between our model and these river network models .",
    "first , the correlation among moving averages considered in @xcite and @xcite decreases much faster than the correlation considered in this work .",
    "most importantly , any location along the river is observable , while observations can only be made at the leaves of the tree in our framework .",
    "the concept of microergodicity was formalized by @xcite in the context of spatial models .",
    "this concept was especially needed in the infill asymptotic framework , when some parameters can not be consistently estimated even if the whole process is observed .",
    "specifically , consider the complete process @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the space of all possible observation units .",
    "in spatial infill asymptotics , @xmath27 can be the unit cube @xmath28^d$ ] . in our hierarchical framework",
    ", we consider a sequence of nested trees converging to a limit tree , which is the union of all nodes and edges of the nested trees . in this case",
    ", @xmath27 is the set of all tips in the limit tree . consider a probability model @xmath29 on @xmath26 . a function @xmath30 of the parameter vector is said to be microergodic if for all @xmath31 , @xmath32 implies that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are orthogonal .",
    "if a parameter is not microergodic , then there is no hope of constructing any consistent estimator for it ; see @xcite for an excellent explanation . in spatial infill asymptotics with ou correlation in dimension @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath24",
    "are not microergodic even though @xmath8 is [ @xcite ] , and the mle of @xmath35 is strongly consistent [ @xcite ] .",
    "also note that the microergodicity of @xmath36 is equivalent to the microergodicity of both @xmath24 and @xmath1 .",
    "we recall here the theory of equivalent gaussian measures , which we apply to ornstein  uhlenbeck tree models in the next section .",
    "we consider two gaussian measures @xmath37 @xmath38 on the @xmath39-algebra @xmath40 generated by a sequence of random variables @xmath41 , a linearly independent basis for both @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the hilbert space generated by @xmath41 with linear product : @xmath45 for @xmath46 or @xmath47 . the entropy distance between equivalent gaussian measures",

    ". then @xmath69 @xcite take a similar approach using the hellinger distance instead of the entropy distance @xmath59 .",
    "they show that the following condition is sufficient for the orthogonality of @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath70      we say that @xmath71 is a subtree of tree @xmath72 if we can get @xmath71 by removing some branches from @xmath72 .",
    "we consider a nested sequence of trees @xmath73 such that @xmath74 is a subtree of @xmath75 for every @xmath76 .",
    "this is to ensure that the observations @xmath55 at the tips of @xmath75 provide a well - defined infinite sequence @xmath77 .",
    "one essential assumption is that trees are ultrametric , that is , the distance from the root to leaf nodes of tree @xmath75 is assumed to be the same for all tips .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the tree distances between tips define an ultrametric metric .",
    "this assumption comes in naturally .",
    "if the distance from the root to all tips is constant , models ( [ eqrandomrootv ] ) and ( [ eqfixedrootv ] ) predict equal variances and equal means at the tips , which are reasonable assumptions .",
    "ultrametric trees arise in most applications when tips are extant species sampled at the present time , and branch lengths represent time calibrated in millions of years , for instance . define @xmath78 as the set of all internal nodes of tree @xmath75 ( including the root ) and @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 be the sequence of node ages .",
    "the age of a node is the distance from the node to any of its descendant tip .",
    "this is well defined on ultrametric trees .",
    "@xmath78 is a subset of @xmath81 so @xmath82 is a well - defined infinite sequence . in most of what follows",

    ". with this assumption @xmath78 contains @xmath83 internal nodes .",

    "theorems  [ thmaddmica ] and  [ thmaddmic ] below state general results on the microergodicity of parameters in ou tree models .",
    "our main tool is the equivalence ( [ thmaddmic01 ] ) applied to @xmath86 , the entropy distance between @xmath33 and @xmath34 for two parameter sets @xmath87 , @xmath88 , on the @xmath39-algebra generated by @xmath55 .",
