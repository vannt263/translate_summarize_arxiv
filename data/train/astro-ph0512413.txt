    "accounting for @xmath9 of the nearby supernova population , type ibc supernovae ( hereafter sne ibc ) are identified by their lack of spectroscopic hydrogen and silicon features ( see @xcite for a review ) . recognized as a rare subclass of core - collapse supernova @xmath10 years ago @xcite , sne ibc have recently enjoyed a revitalized interest . beginning with the discovery of type ic sn1998bw in temporal and spatial coincidence with gamma - ray burst ( grb)980425 @xcite , we now know that most long - duration grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ; @xcite ) are associated with sne ibc .",
    "however , radio observations of local sne ibc indicate that the inverse is _ not _ true ; there is a strict limit of @xmath11 on the fraction of sne ibc that could be accompanied by a grb or xrf @xcite .",
    "the lack of hydrogen features in both sne ibc and grb / xrf - associated sne imply that they represent the explosion of massive stripped - core progenitors @xcite .",
    "the popular models for sne ibc progenitors include massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars that eject their envelopes through strong dense winds , and close binary systems where the progenitor star is stripped of its hydrogen - rich layer by the companion @xcite . despite dedicated archival searches , the progenitors of sne ibc",
    "are still poorly constrained by pre - explosion images .",
    "the best photometric constraints are currently associated with sn2002ap and sn2004gt which exclude wr progenitors in the top @xmath12 and @xmath8 of the population , respectively @xcite .",
    "while intriguing , these archival observations lack the sensitivity to clearly discriminate between the wr and binary progenitor models .    by studying the circumstellar medium around the supernova , however , it is possible to place independent constraints on the progenitor .",
    "observations show that galactic wolf - rayet stars are embedded in wind stratified media @xcite while binary systems are associated with disrupted circumstellar media , possibly including an outflow during a common envelope phase @xcite .",
    "radio observations provide the most direct probe of the circumstellar density structure around supernovae @xcite . by observing the dynamical interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding medium we are able to map out the mass loss history of the progenitor star .",
    "the identification of irregular density profiles may therefore distinguish between wolf - rayet and binary progenitor systems .",
    "here we present extensive radio observations of sn2003bg , discovered as part of our ongoing radio survey of local type ibc supernovae .",
    "the peculiar sn2003bg spectroscopically evolved from a broad - lined type ic to a hydrogen - rich type ii and later to a typical type ibc ( hamuy _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep ) , thereby bridging the hydrogen - rich and poor divisions of the core - collapse classification system .",
    "our densely - sampled radio light - curves show that the extraordinarily luminous radio emission for a sn ibc is characterized by episodic short - timescale variations .",
    "we show that these variations are well described by abrupt density enhancements in the circumstellar medium .",
    "comparison with other radio supernovae shows that @xmath8 of all well - studied events similarly show evidence for abrupt light - curve variations .",
    "we review the mass loss evolution observed ( and inferred ) for the progenitors of these core - collapse sne . using the observed radio properties for the peculiar sn2003bg , we place constraints on the nature of its progenitor system .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : observations from the very large array ( vla ) and the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( cxo ) are described in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "preliminary estimates of the energy , velocity and density of the radio emitting region are presented in  [ sec : ep ] .",
    "modeling of the radio light - curves are presented in ",
    "[ sec : model ] and  [ sec : ssa ] while a discussion of the radio polarization mechanism follows as  [ sec : pol_disc ] .",
    "our modeling of the x - ray emission is discussed in  [ sec : xray_model ] . in  [ sec : bumps ] we present a compilation of radio supernovae with abrupt light - curve variations and review their circumstellar irregularities . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : prog ] we discuss the possible causes of the density enhancements surrounding sn2003bg and the implications for the progenitor system .",
    "sn2003bg was optically discovered on 2003 february 25.7 ut , offset 16.3 w and 24\".6 s from the center of host galaxy , mcg -05 - 10 - 15 , at @xmath13 mpc @xcite .",
    "early spectroscopy on 2003 february 28 ut indicated that sn2003bg was a peculiar type ic supernova with broad optical absorption lines , indicative of fast photospheric velocities and comparable to those seen in sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "soon thereafter , sn2003bg developed strong , broad h@xmath14 emission with a p - cygni absorption component indicating an expansion velocity of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "p - cygni components were additionally observed for h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 , prompting the reclassification of sn2003bg as an unusual type ii supernova .",
    "nebular spectra taken several months later revealed that all evidence of hydrogen had disappeared , suggestive that the sn had transitioned back to a type ibc event ( hamuy et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the peak time of the optical light - curves suggests that sn2003bg was discovered within just a few days of explosion ( hamuy , private communication ) . throughout this paper",
    "we therefore assume an approximate explosion date of 2003 february 22 ut .",
    "motivated by the spectroscopic similarity of sn2003bg to the radio luminous sn1998bw , we initiated radio observations of sn2003bg on 2003 march 4.07 ut with the very large array ( vla ) . at 8.46 ghz",
    "we detected a radio source coincident with the optical position at @xmath18 ( @xmath190.1 arcsec in each coordinate ) with flux density of @xmath20 mjy ( figure  [ fig : rgb ] ) .",
    "we subsequently began an intense follow - up campaign to study the temporal and spectral evolution of the radio emission .",
    "radio data were collected at 1.43 , 4.86 , 8.46 , 15.0 , 22.5 and 43.3 ghz spanning 2003 march through 2005 october and are summarized in table  [ tab : vla ] .",
    "all vla observations were taken in standard continuum observing mode with a bandwidth of @xmath21 mhz . at 22.5 and 43.3",
    "ghz we included referenced pointing scans to correct for the systematic 10 - 20 arcsec pointing errors of the vla antennas .",
    "we used 3c48 , 3c147 and 3c286 ( j0137 + 331 , j0542 + 498 and j1331 + 305 ) for flux calibration , while phase referencing was performed against calibrators j0407 - 330 and j0453 - 281 .",
    "data were reduced using standard packages within the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . no diffuse radio emission from the host galaxy",
    "was detected in any of our observations .",
    "flux density measurements were obtained by fitting a gaussian model to the sn .",
    "in addition to the _ rms _ noise in each measurement , we include a systematic uncertainty of @xmath22 due to the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the sn2003bg radio light - curves are compiled in figures  [ fig : oneplot ] and [ fig : lt_curves ] , spanning @xmath23 to @xmath24 days after the explosion .",
    "the radio evolution of sn2003bg is characterized by several achromatic short timescale ( @xmath25 ) variations . as will be discussed in  [ sec : bumps ] , light - curve variations have also been observed for @xmath8 of well - sampled radio supernovae including type iil sn1979c @xcite , type ic sn1998bw @xcite , and more recently for type iib sn2001ig @xcite .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : spectral_indices ] are the spectral indices between each of the adjacent radio frequencies .",
    "a spectral turnover is clearly observed for the lower frequencies at early time ; at later time the spectral slope converges to @xmath26 .",
    "the observed spectral shape is overall consistent with a non - thermal synchrotron spectrum with a significant absorption component that suppresses the low frequency emission . in the case of radio supernovae ,",
    "a low frequency turn - over may be attributed to internal synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ; @xcite ) or free - free absorption ( ffa ; @xcite ) from the external medium .",

    "we fit these functions to two well - sampled radio spectra collected on 2003 march 17 and 2004 february 8 ( @xmath34 and 351 days ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , the optically - thick spectral component in each epoch is best described with a spectral index of @xmath35 , and thus entirely consistent with the index predicted by the ssa dominated model . specifically , we find the following best - fit ssa parameters : @xmath36 mjy ( 50 mjy ) and @xmath37 ghz ( 2.2 ghz ) with @xmath38 ( 4.5 ) for the early ( late ) spectrum .",
    "the ffa dominated models produce steeper optically - thick spectra ( @xmath39 ) and thus provide a significantly worse fit to the data .",
    "we find the following best - fit ffa parameters : @xmath40 ( 35 ) and @xmath41 ( 0.12 ) with @xmath42 ( 8.2 ) for the early ( late ) spectra .",
    "here we have adopted @xmath43 for both models , consistent with the observed optically - thin spectral indices from @xmath44 to 1000 days ( figure  [ fig : spectral_indices ] ) .",
    "clearly the ssa model fit is preferred over the ffa fit in both epochs .",
    "we conclude that internal ssa dominates the absorption on the timescale probed by the radio data .",
    "since synchrotron emission is inherently polarized , the magnetic field geometry of radio sne can be directly probed through polarization measurements . in order to measure the polarization for sn2003bg",
    ", we carried out a full polarization calibration of our 8.46 ghz vla observations taken on 2003 october 7.4 ut ( @xmath45 days ) .",
    "this run was chosen for polarization calibration based on the high dynamic range of the radio image . to correct for the instrumental polarization , we observed calibrator j0403 + 260 over a wide range in parallactic angle and computed the leakage terms with aips task pcal .",
    "we used 3c147 to calibrate the absolute polarization angle .",
    "we do not find any significant polarization for sn2003bg .",
    "in particular , we place a limit on the linear polarization intensity ( @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the stokes parameters ) of @xmath49 mjy , corresponding to a fractional polarization limit of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . in comparison with other radio",
    "sn linear polarization measurements this is one of the deepest limits obtained to date : a factor of @xmath52 deeper than the limit for sn1993j ( @xmath53 , @xcite ) and comparable to that for sn1979c ( @xmath54 , @xcite ) .",
    "sn2003bg was observed with the _ chandra _ acis - s detector on 2003 march 24.5 ut ( @xmath55 days after the explosion ) for 50.5 ksec .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of an x - ray source at @xmath56 ( @xmath190.5 arcsec in each coordinate ) , coincident with the optical sn position .",
    "the source was re - observed with acis - s on 2003 june 22.3 ut ( @xmath57 days ) for 40.5 ksec to search for variability between the two epochs .",
    "we retrieved the sn2003bg data from the _ chandra _ data archive and reduced them following the ciao science threads .",
    "the source is clearly detected in both epochs and we note that no diffuse emission is detected from the host galaxy . for spectral extraction of the sn emission , we adopt a source aperture of 4.92 arcsec and a large background region located @xmath10 arcsec from the source . after subtracting off the background emission , we measure count rates of @xmath58 and @xmath59 cps ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) in the first and second epochs , respectively .",
    "@xcite report that the first epoch data can be reasonably fit with several different spectral models and propose a mekal hot plasma model for the best fit .",
    "given that the small number of counts prevents the model fits to be distinguished , we fit the extracted sn spectra with only two basic models : absorbed power - law and thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "table  [ tab : cxo ] lists the parameter values for our resulting spectral fits , where we have adopted both fixed and variable @xmath60 values for comparison .",
    "@xcite dust maps give @xmath61 mag for the position of sn2003bg . using the standard conversion of @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath62 for the galactic column density along our the line - of - sight .",
    "the relatively few x - ray counts enable satisfactory fits ( @xmath63 ) for each of the models .",
    "given the significantly fewer counts in the second epoch , we fit the spectrum with a fixed ( galactic ) absorption .",
    "moreover , for the power - law fit we adopt the best - fit spectral index from our first epoch .",
    "the resulting flux values appear in table  [ tab : cxo ] for both power - law and thermal bremsstrahlung fits . as in the case of the first epoch ,",
    "both models provide an equally good representation of the data .    in figure  [",
    "fig : chandra ] we show the absorbed power - law model fits for epochs 1 and 2 , assuming a fixed galactic @xmath64 .",
    "using the associated spectral parameters in table  [ tab : cxo ] , we find unabsorbed flux values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( 0.310 kev ) for these fits , respectively .",
    "the observed temporal evolution is @xmath67 with @xmath68 and the implied spectral indices between the optically thin radio and x - ray band are nearly constant at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , for the first and second _ chandra _ epochs , respectively . at a distance of 19.6 mpc ,",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity values are thus @xmath71 and @xmath72 , placing sn2003bg among the most x - ray luminous sne ever detected and a factor of @xmath73 fainter than sn1998bw on a comparable timescale .",
    "@xcite showed that there is an upper limit to the brightness temperature , @xmath74 , for ssa dominated radio sources .",
    "this limit corresponds to the scenario where the fractions of post - shock energy density in relativistic electrons ( @xmath75 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath76 ) are in equipartition , and the shocked electrons are accelerated into a power - law distribution , @xmath77 , above a minimum lorentz factor , @xmath78 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the equipartition brightness temperature , @xmath79 k , defines the upper bound on @xmath74 @xcite . here , @xmath80 is the equipartition size ( radius ) of the radio source .",
    "it is noted that @xmath81 depends only weakly on the observed peak frequency and flux density .    under the assumption that @xmath82 , we can estimate the radius and energy of the radio emitting material for sn2003bg .",
    "our first vla epoch in which the spectral turnover is observed is 2003 march 29 ( @xmath83 days ) . in this epoch",
    "we observed a peak flux density of @xmath84 mjy at @xmath85 ghz and an optically thin spectral index of @xmath86 ( figure  [ fig : spectral_indices ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , on the timescale probed by our observations the sn2003bg radio spectrum is well fit with a ssa model and we therefore identify the spectral peak as the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , @xmath87 ( defined as the frequency where the optical depth due to ssa is unity ; @xmath88 ) . using equations 2 and 3 of @xcite ( hereafter s05 ) the observed source properties ( @xmath89 , @xmath28 , @xmath16 , and @xmath90 ) imply an equipartition radius of @xmath91as ( @xmath92 cm ) and a total energy for the radio emitting material of @xmath93 erg , where we have assumed @xmath4 .",
    "the average velocity of the radio shell is therefore roughly @xmath94 and the magnetic field is @xmath95 g.    a comparison with the ejecta velocities compiled for core - collapse sne @xcite shows that sn2003bg resembles more closely a type ibc ( typical ejecta velocities , @xmath96 ) rather than a type ii event ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "moreover , the inferred ejecta velocity for sn2003bg is a factor of @xmath23 slower than the mildly relativistic speed inferred for sn1998bw .",
    "this analysis emphasizes that broad optical absorption lines can not be used as a proxy for relativistic ejecta , consistent with the radio analysis for broad - lined sne 2002ap @xcite and sn2003jd @xcite .",
    "our preliminary constraint on the minimum energy for sn2003bg places it among the most energetic radio sne ibc ever observed , second only to sn1998bw and comparable to sn2003l ( s05 ) .",
    "we note that additional absorption processes ( e.g. ffa ) and departures from equipartition ( e.g. sn1993j ; @xcite ) increase the energy budget further .    equipartition analysis may also be used to roughly constrain the characteristic synchrotron frequency , @xmath98 . equating particle kinetic energy across the shock discontinuity ,",
    "s05 show that @xmath99 ghz which gives @xmath100 ghz for @xmath101 with the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 given above . at @xmath83 days",
    ", @xmath98 is therefore already below our radio observing band and the synchrotron break frequencies are ordered such that @xmath104 .    finally , we use these equipartition results at @xmath105 days to estimate the mass loss rate of the progenitor star . from @xcite , the mass loss rate of the star , @xmath106 , can be derived from the post - shock energy density in magnetic fields :    @xmath107    where we have assumed a stellar wind - blown medium ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we find @xmath109 ( assuming a wolf - rayet wind velocity of @xmath7 ) .    for comparison",
    ", we estimate the mass loss rate assuming ffa dominates the absorption . in this scenario ,",
    "the shock radius is larger than the equipartition estimate and so our equipartition parameters provide only a lower limit on the mass loss rate of the progenitor star . using equation 2.3 of @xcite we find :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the optical depth to ffa processes and @xmath112 is the temperature normalized to @xmath113 k. here we have adopted the notation @xmath114 where @xmath106 is given in units of @xmath115 and @xmath116 is given in @xmath117 . setting @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    "we find @xmath120 corresponding to a mass loss rate of @xmath121 ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath105 days .",
    "this is three orders of magnitude larger than that derived from the ssa interpretation .",
    "moreover , this would imply that the total energy of the radio emitting material ( a proxy for the kinetic energy of the fastest ejecta , @xmath122 ) exceeds @xmath123 erg .",
    "since hydrodynamic collapse distributes the ejecta kinetic energy as @xmath124 @xcite , this would imply that the optical data ( with @xmath125 ) have @xmath126 erg , larger than any other core - collapse sn to date .",
    "this result , taken together with the fact that a ssa model provides a significantly better fit to the radio spectra , leads us to conclude that the observed spectral turn - over is due to internal synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "in modeling the radio light - curves of sn2003bg , we adopt the formalism of s05 where we presented a rigorous formulation of the temporal and spectral evolution of synchrotron emission arising from sub - relativistic supernova ejecta .",
    "s05 show how the observed sn radio emission spectrum at any single epoch is determined by three parameters : @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . here ,",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath128 are normalization constants of the flux density and optical depth with cgs units of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are in turn determined by the values of four physical parameters : the magnetic field , @xmath132 , the shock radius , @xmath133 , the minimum electron lorentz factor , @xmath134 , and the ratio @xmath135 . with four physical parameters ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath136 ) and only three constraints ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath137 ) , we must assume an additional constraint to find a unique solution .",
    "this constraint is obtained by adopting a value for @xmath136 . by inverting the equations for @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ,",
    "s05 derive the following expressions for @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 :    @xmath138    here , @xmath90 is the distance to the supernova and @xmath139 characterizes the the thickness of the radiating electron shell as @xmath140 .",
    "the number density of the synchrotron emitting electrons then follows directly as    @xmath141    where it is assumed that the contribution from electrons in a thermal distribution is negligible .",
    "the circumstellar density can be expressed in terms of a progenitor mass loss rate    @xmath142    [ eqn : m_dot ]    by adopting a value for the wind velocity .",
    "the total energy of the radio emitting material at a given epoch is then given by    @xmath143    where it should be noted that @xmath144 depends not only on @xmath136 but also on an assumed value of @xmath75 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , several models have been proposed for hydrodynamic evolution of the sub - relativistic supernova ejecta . based on separate assumptions ,",
    "these analytic models constrain the temporal behavior of the shock radius , magnetic field , electron lorentz factor , and energy partition fractions . here , we adopt the standard ssa model ( model 1 of @xcite ) for the hydrodynamical evolution of the ejecta .",
    "this model assumes that the evolution is self - similar across the shock discontinuity , and thus @xmath145 with @xmath146 where @xmath147 characterizes the density profile of the outer sn ejecta ( @xmath148 ) and @xmath149 characterizes the density profile of the radiating electrons within the shocked circumstellar material ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "in addition , the standard ssa model assumes that the magnetic energy density ( @xmath151 ) and the relativistic electron energy density ( @xmath152 ) scale as the total post - shock energy density ( @xmath153 ) . in this scenario , the magnetic field",
    "is amplified by turbulence near the shock discontinuity , implying fixed energy fractions , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and thus a constant value of @xmath136 throughout the evolution of the ejecta .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field is determined by the csm density profile and the expansion of the shock radius : @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "we note that for a wind stratified medium , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor evolves as @xmath158 with @xmath159 . from the scalings of equation  [ eqn : energy ] it follows that @xmath160 , and",
    "therefore the total post - shock energy increases with time until the swept up circumstellar mass is comparable to rest mass of the sn ejecta .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : oneplot ] and briefly discussed in  [ sec : obs ] , the radio light - curves for sn2003bg are characterized by achromatic short timescale variability , inconsistent with the strict power - law evolution prescribed by the standard model . in an effort to model the overall evolution of the radio ejecta we therefore divide the multi - frequency light - curves into four subsections , each defined by the observed time of abrupt variation .",
    "we then apply the ssa model described in  [ sec : model ] to each subsection .",
    "figure  [ fig : lt_curves ] shows that the first peak observed for each of the radio frequencies is chromatic , and therefore produced by a cascading spectral break .",
    "we define the time range for this chromatic evolution phase to be @xmath161 days , extending until just before the first achromatic variation is observed . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] the radio emission is well described by a ssa dominated spectrum and we therefore attribute this chromatic subsection to the passage of @xmath87 through the observed frequencies .",
    "the evolution of the spectral indices ( figure  [ fig : spectral_indices ] ) indicate that the self - absorption frequency cascades as @xmath162 , consistent with typical values observed for other ssa dominated radio supernovae @xcite .    using our multi - frequency radio data collected during the time range of the first peak and adopting @xmath163 , we fit for the constants @xmath127 and @xmath128 as well as the temporal indices @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : ep ] , @xmath98 is estimated to be below the radio band during our observations and thus is unconstrained by the data .",

    "@xcite show that for @xmath174 and @xmath175 , @xmath179 . adopting this value , we find that the expansion of the ejecta is described by @xmath180 cm , and the average velocity is @xmath181 .",
    "the radio ejecta therefore expand with a modest sub - relativistic velocity comparable to that observed for sn2002ap @xcite and significantly slower than sn1998bw ( bulk lorentz factor , @xmath182 on a similar timescale @xcite . adopting @xmath4",
    "we find that the total energy of the radio emitting material is given by @xmath183 erg , comparable to that of sn1998bw .",
    "the magnetic field evolves radially as @xmath184 g , slightly steeper than that observed for type ic sne 2003l ( s05 ) , 2002ap @xcite and the type iib sn1993j @xcite . the electron number density and associated mass loss rate are thus given by @xmath185 and @xmath186 where we have assumed a wolf - rayet wind velocity of @xmath187 and adopted a nucleon - to - electron density ratio of two ( appropriate for wr winds ) .",
    "this mass loss rate is consistent with the values observed for galactic wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "shortly after the observed ssa peak cascades through 8.46 ghz , an abrupt rise was observed at the optically thin frequencies . by @xmath188 days",
    "the radio emission reached an _",
    "second peak .",
    "subsequent achromatic light - curve variations were later observed at @xmath189 and 600 days and are most pronounced at frequencies above @xmath87 . as shown in figure  [ fig : spectral_indices ] these variations were associated with abrupt changes in the spectral indices , most notably for those indices which straddle @xmath87 .",
    "possible causes for these abrupt light - curve variations include energy injection from a central engine , interaction of the reverse shock with density structures in the ejecta , and interaction of the forward shock with csm density enhancements .",
    "@xcite invoke energy injection to explain the achromatic second peak in the radio light - curves of sn1998bw at @xmath190 days .",
    "this interpretation was supported by the inferred mildly relativistic ejecta speeds and associated prompt gamma - ray emission , suggestive that sn1998bw was powered by a grb - like central engine . in the case of sn2003bg",
    ", however , the inferred ejecta speed is merely sub - relativistic and therefore there is no evidence for an engine - driven explosion .",
    "we conclude that the variations observed for sn2003bg can not be attributed to long - lived engine activity .",
    "@xcite show that the late - time flattening observed for the sn1993j radio light - curves can be produced through the interaction of the reverse shock with density inhomogeneities within the ejecta .",
    "while the 1-d hydrodynamical simulations provide a reasonable fit to the smooth evolution of sn1993j at @xmath191 days , it is not clear that they could produce the abrupt rise at @xmath192 days observed for sn2003bg .",
    "moreover , any abrupt features in the ejecta would likely be smoothed by instabilities in a 3-d simulation .    in the third scenario ,",
    "the interaction between the forward shock and strong density variations in the circumstellar material produces abrupt changes in the temporal evolution of the radio light - curves . for a wind - stratified medium with constant progenitor mass loss rate ,",
    "the circumstellar density is predicted to follow a smooth @xmath193 profile .",
    "abrupt deviations from a wind density profile have been inferred for several radio supernovae ( e.g. sn1979c ; @xcite ) and are argued to be the result of a variable mass loss history and/or the effects of a binary companion on the structure of the csm .",
    "these density induced variations are more pronounced at optically thin frequencies than for optically thick .",
    "here we show that the light - curve variations observed for sn2003bg are similarly due to csm density enhancements .    we model the sn2003bg radio light - curves with a simple density enhancement model under the following assumptions : ( a ) the density variations can be approximated by modest abrupt jumps in the csm such that the density profile returns to @xmath194 after each enhancement , ( b ) the hydrodynamical evolution of the ejecta returns to the self - similar solution after each jump , thereby maintaining the same values of @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath195 both before and after each density enhancement , ( c ) the microphysics of the shock are not affected by the density jumps and therefore @xmath75 and @xmath76 remain constant throughout the evolution of the ejecta , ( d )",
    "the bulk motion of the ejecta is not significantly affected by the density jumps since the slower , more massive material behind the shock continues to plow forward , and ( e ) the minimum lorentz factor of the radiating electrons is not affected by the csm enhancements , although the number of electrons participating in the radio emission increases .    maintaining a self - similar evolution throughout the density variations",
    "requires that the magnetic field is enhanced by each of the csm jumps .",
    "moreover , since @xmath75 and @xmath76 are assumed to be fixed constants , the additional thermal energy produced by these enhancements causes an increase in the total energy of the radio emitting region .",
    "therefore , in fitting the subsequent peaks in the sn2003bg radio light - curves , we assume that the evolution of @xmath133 and @xmath78 remain effectively unchanged while @xmath132 and @xmath144 vary according to the strength of the csm density enhancements .",
    "we recognize that this simple density enhancement model is not fully consistent with the hydrodynamic evolution of the ejecta .",
    "in fact , a small change in the radial expansion is expected as the shock wave reaches the higher density region .",
    "for the @xmath175 self - similar solution adopted here and the modest density enhancements we infer , we estimate this to be minor effect ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , the variations in ejecta parameters ( @xmath132 and @xmath144 ) are primarily the result of the csm density enhancements rather than the minor variations in radial expansion .",
    "however , the series of density jumps that we infer cause the evolution of the radio ejecta to gradually deviate from the initial radial evolution , making our model less accurate at very late time ( after several years ) .",
    "in addition , we note that the outflow does not immediately settle on the new self - similar solution following each density variation , but instead settles on a timescale comparable for the radius to double ( i.e. the ratio of the settling time to the age of the blastwave is of order unity ) .",
    "thus the sharp features appearing in our light - curve fits are merely an artifact of our model assumptions .    as discussed in ",

    "@xmath197 and @xmath198 . by fitting for @xmath132 at each density variation ,",
    "the new values of @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath98 are thus directly determined .",
    "the observed timescales and estimated circumstellar radii for each density enhancement are given in table  [ tab : peaks ] .",
    "we note that we do not fit the short rise time of each phase during which the ejecta are settling to the new self - similar solution .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lt_curves ] , we find reasonable fits for each of the light - curve phases by invoking modest ( factor of @xmath199 ) density enhancements . in table",
    "[ tab : peaks ] we list the values of @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath98 and the associated enhancement factors for the density , magnetic field and ejecta energy for each phase . it is interesting to note that the strength of the enhancements decay with time .",
    "as discussed in in  [ sec : obs ] , our vla observations constrain the linear polarization of the radio emission to less than @xmath200 .",
    "although the synchrotron emission from the radio ejecta is inherently polarized , the observed polarization level can be significantly suppressed for two reasons .",
    "first , since the sn2003bg radiosphere is not resolved in the vla data our polarization limit applies to the _ integrated _ polarization of the ejecta emission .",
    "as shown for supernova remnant cas a , the integrated polarization can be significantly suppressed due to the approximate circular symmetry of the radio ejecta @xcite .",
    "second , the radio emission can be depolarized due to internal faraday dispersion within the ejecta @xcite . for the density and magnetic field values we derive from our ssa model ,",
    "we predict the integrated linear polarization of the sn2003bg radio emission to be negligible , consistent with the observations .",
    "x - ray emission in supernovae can be produced by three processes @xcite : [ 1 ] non - thermal synchrotron emission from radiating electrons , [ 2 ] thermal ( free - free ) bremsstrahlung emission from material in the circumstellar shock and/or the ejecta reverse shock , and [ 3 ] inverse compton scattering of photospheric photons by relativistic electrons .",
    "we examine each of these scenarios in the context of the bright x - ray emission observed for sn2003bg .      as shown in table  [",
    "tab : cxo ] , the spectral index between the optically thin radio and x - ray emission is @xmath201 for both _",
    "chandra _ epochs . assuming a constant injection spectral index from the radio to x - ray bands we extrapolate the observed radio spectral index of @xmath202 to the x - ray and find that the synchrotron emission under - predicts the observed x - ray flux by a factor of @xmath23 in both epochs .",
    "this discrepancy grows significantly larger when the synchrotron cooling break , @xmath203 , is included , beyond which the spectrum steepens by @xmath204 . using the magnetic field derived in section  [ sec : ssa ] , the cooling frequency at @xmath0 ( 120 ) days is @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) hz .",
    "including the cooling break and extrapolating from @xmath207 to @xmath208 as @xmath209 , the synchrotron flux falls five orders of magnitude below the observed x - ray emission .",
    "we therefore conclude that the x - ray emission is not dominated by synchrotron emission .      in a scenario dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung processes ,",
    "the x - ray emission is produced by the forward shock plowing into circumstellar material and/or the reverse shock heating of the ejecta . in this case ,",
    "the strength of the x - ray emission depends strongly on the density of the csm and unshocked ejecta .",
    "the shocked material then cools by free - free emission processes . for a wind stratified density profile ,",
    "the summed free - free luminosity from the forward and reverse shock is generalized @xcite roughly by    @xmath210    where @xmath211 is a constant such that @xmath212 . from our ssa radio model",
    "we find @xmath172 and @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) , thus @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "the predicted x - ray luminosity is therefore a factor of @xmath217 fainter than the first epoch observation .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume the x - ray emission must be dominated by free - free processes , then this implies a significantly higher mass loss rate of @xmath218 ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "however , we reiterate that a high density model dominated by external absorption processes is inconsistent with the observed radio spectrum ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] )",
    ". a possible compromise could be that the x - ray emission is produced by dense csm clumps distributed with a very low filling factor ( @xmath219 ) such that the radio emission is optically thin .",
    "this scenario was invoked for the radio luminous type iin sn1986j @xcite . however , the dense csm clumps inferred for type iin s also give rise to bright nebular h@xmath14 emission lines which are not present in the nebular spectra of sn2003bg .",
    "moreover , it would be difficult to sustain the ejecta velocities inferred from our radio modeling in such a a high density environment ( chevalier & fransson , _ in prep _ ) .",
    "we conclude that the radio and optical emission do not support a scenario in which the observed x - ray flux is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "x - ray emission from supernovae can also be produced by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the relativistic electrons by the optical photons .",
    "this process was observed to be important in explaining the observed x - ray emission for sn2002ap @xcite and sn2003l ( s05 ) on timescales comparable to the optical maximum . in this scenario",
    "the ratio of flux measured in the radio and x - ray bands , respectively is given by    @xmath220    where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are the energy densities in magnetic fields and up - scattered photons , respectively .",
    "we note that equation  [ eqn : fxfr ] is relatively insensitive to the spectral energy index of the electrons .",
    "@xcite show that    @xmath223    where @xmath224 is the time in days , @xmath225 is the optical luminosity at @xmath226 normalized to @xmath227 and @xmath228 is the shock velocity .    at the time at the first x - ray observation , @xmath229 , the optically thin radio flux was @xmath230 and the unabsorbed x - ray flux was @xmath231 ; therefore @xmath232 . from our ssa radio modeling (  [ sec : ssa ] ) we estimate @xmath233 g and @xmath234 at @xmath0 days .",
    "based on the optical peak magnitude ( hamuy et al .",

    "we conclude that inverse compton emission can produce the bright x - ray luminosity in the first epoch .",
    "the second epoch , however , can not be explained through ics . from our radio model at @xmath240 , @xmath241 g , @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "the optical light - curve implies @xmath244 at this time",
    ". therefore we estimate @xmath245 and a predicted ic x - ray flux of @xmath246 which is a factor of @xmath247 fainter than that observed .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray flux observed at 120 days is dominated by a separate process , possibly due to a cosmic ray dominated sn shock which produces a late - time flattening of x - ray light - curves in sne ibc ( chevalier @xmath248 fransson , _ in prep . _ )",
    "we have shown that the abrupt radio light - curve variations observed for sn2003bg can be attributed to density enhancements in the circumstellar medium . in comparison with well - sampled radio supernovae compiled from previous studies including our ongoing survey of type ibc events ( soderberg _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep ) , we find that @xmath8 of radio supernovae similarly show evidence for abrupt achromatic variations . at the same time , there are several examples of well - studied radio supernovae with smooth light - curve evolutions including type iib sn1993j @xcite and type ic sn2003l ( s05 ) among others . in table",
    "[ tab : bumps ] , we compile the light - curve properties for radio supernovae with abrupt variability .",
    "we emphasize that this compilation contains core - collapse sne from nearly all spectroscopic classifications , including hydrogen - rich type iil , iin and iib in addition to hydrogen - poor type ibc .",
    "table  [ tab : bumps ] shows that the short timescale variability observed for radio supernovae can be qualitatively divided into three types .",
    "the most common effect is an abrupt steepening of the radio light - curves as observed for sn1988z @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an abrupt rise in the optically thin flux has been observed for a couple of events ( e.g. sn1987a , @xcite ) .",
    "more intriguingly , episodic ( and perhaps periodic ) light - curve bumps are observed for sne 1979c @xcite , 2001ig @xcite , 1998bw @xcite and 2003bg , all of which are characterized by modest flux deviations ( factor of @xmath199 ) .",
    "these three types of radio variability are generally attributed to dynamical interaction of the ejecta with irregularities in the circumstellar medium .",
    "abrupt density variations in the media surrounding core - collapse supernovae are known to be produced in a variety of ways , including : [ 1 ] fluctuations in the progenitor mass loss rate and/or wind velocity .",
    "this scenario is supported through observations of local supernova remnants and massive stars which collectively suggest a complex picture for mass loss during the final stage of stellar evolution . [ 2 ] termination shocks between stellar winds ejected during the evolution of the progenitor star may produce abrupt density enhancements at radii of @xmath249 pc @xcite .",
    "case 2 is observationally motivated by the circumstellar nebulae associated with local wolf - rayet stars , which are produced by interacting stellar winds @xcite . [ 3 ] a clumpy stellar wind perhaps resulting from fragmentation of circumstellar shells by rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite .",
    "this scenario is motivated by narrow h@xmath14 line profiles observed for type iin supernovae . in the case of sn1988z ,",
    "@xcite propose a shocked dense wind component at @xmath250 cm to explain the low velocity line emission .",
    "[ 4 ] the effects of a binary companion on the circumstellar wind profile .",
    "this case is observationally motivated by the binary companion for type iib sn1993j @xcite and the dense circumstellar ring around sn1987a at @xmath251 cm @xcite commonly attributed to the effects of a companion star @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the binary system parameters determine the circumstellar radii at which the progenitor wind is most affected . [ 5 ] a close binary progenitor system embedded in a common envelope @xcite . given that the rate of sn progenitors in common envelope binary systems is predicted to be low ( @xmath252 of sne ibc ; @xcite ) this scenario is expected to be rare . as an example , a common envelope system has been argued to explain the large inferred density enhancement at @xmath253 cm responsible for strong radio @xcite , x - ray @xcite and optical ( h@xmath14 ; @xcite ) emission in the unusual type ic sn2001em at @xmath254 years @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the strength and location of circumstellar density variations depends on the method by which the density profile was disturbed .",
    "we note that cases 3 and 5 are generally associated with hydrogen - rich events whereas cases 1 , 2 and 4 are applicable to all classes of core - collapse supernovae .    finally , in light of this compilation it is interesting to note that an abrupt rise in the optically thin radio emission of type ibc supernovae can also be attributed to the presence of an off - axis gamma - ray burst jet @xcite .",
    "as the jet sweeps up circumstellar material and decelerates , it eventually undergoes a dynamical transition to sub - relativistic expansion on a timescale of @xmath255 yr @xcite .",
    "once sub - relativistic , the jet spreads sideways and the ejecta rapidly approach spherical symmetry .",
    "the observational signature of an off - axis grb is therefore an abrupt optically thin rise as the jet sweeps through our line - of - sight . due to the location of the synchrotron spectral peak , this signature is is most easily detected in the radio band on a timescale of @xmath255 to 10 years @xcite . yet",
    "as we have shown here , many radio supernovae show evidence for density induced variability on this same timescale .",
    "we therefore emphasize that abrupt flux variations in radio supernovae may not be used as a reliable proxy for an off - axis grb jet and/or energy injection from a central engine .",
    "a comparison of the radio light - curves represented in table  [ tab : bumps ] shows that the variations are generally unique to each supernova .",
    "however , as figure  [ fig : lt_curve_comparison ] shows , the separation and intensity of the observed variations in sn2003bg and the type iib sn2001ig are strikingly similar . by simply scaling our sn2003bg light - curve fits by a factor of @xmath256 we obtain a reasonable match to the sn2001ig radio evolution . with this scaling we derive the following physical parameters for the sn2001ig radio emitting ejecta : @xmath257 cm , @xmath258 , @xmath259 g and @xmath260 erg for @xmath4 . the electron number density is thus given by @xmath261 with successive peaks of relative intensity comparable to those observed in sn2003bg ( table  [ tab : peaks ] ) and an associated mass loss rate of @xmath262 ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "we note that this mass loss estimate is comparable to that reported by @xcite , but they adopt free - free absorption for the dominant absorption process and a progenitor wind velocity of @xmath263 , typical of red supergiant type ii sn progenitors .",
    "our ssa modeling , however , shows the ejecta velocity of sn2001ig is consistent with those of sne ibc and the mass loss rate is in fact comparable to galactic wolf - rayet stars , similar to the case of sn2003bg .",
    "figure  [ fig : lt_curve_comparison ] shows that strong light - curve deviations are observed for both sne on timescales of @xmath264 and 300 days with evidence for a weaker feature at @xmath265 days . making the reasonable approximation that the ejecta evolve as @xmath266 cm",
    ", these variations correspond to density enhancements at radial distances of @xmath267 and @xmath268 cm . assuming a progenitor wind velocity of @xmath187",
    ", we infer ejection timescales of @xmath269 and 24 years before the sn explosion .",
    "moreover , as shown in the figure  [ fig : lt_curve_comparison ] the strength of the light - curve variations decreases with time implying that the largest enhancements are closest to the explosion site .",
    "in addition to their radio light - curves , the optical evolution for sne 2003bg and 2001ig are also similar .",
    "in both cases there was spectroscopic evidence for a thin layer of hydrogen near the time of optical maximum @xcite ; however nebular spectra revealed no hydrogen emission in either event ( @xcite ; hamuy , private communication ) days past explosion . ] .",
    "this evolution is characteristic of type iib supernovae ( e.g. sn1993j ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , their inferred ejecta velocities resemble more closely those of sne ibc and therefore imply compact ( wolf - rayet ) progenitors .",
    "we conclude that these two events are intermediate between types iib and ibc , and show more overall similarities to hydrogen - poor events . moreover , the likeness of their observed radio and optical evolution may indicate similar environments and progenitor evolutions .",
    "the overall resemblance of sn2003bg and sn2001ig as outlined in the previous section suggests that a similar process is responsible for the observed density variations . based on the location ( @xmath270 cm ) and relative intensity ( factor of @xmath199 ) of the density enhancements",
    ", we find that cases 1 and 4 ( a variable mass loss rate and the tidal effects of a binary companion , respectively ) provide the most likely explanations for the inferred circumstellar structure .",
    "noting the abrupt fluctuations in the sn2001ig radio light - curves , @xcite recently proposed a binary induced pinwheel nebula for the inferred episodic density enhancements . in this scenario ,",
    "the colliding stellar winds produce a smooth dusty plume that spirals in the plane the binary orbit .",
    "a highly eccentric orbit is required to produce structure at well - defined intervals and a favorable viewing angle is necessary to reproduce the observed flux variations . here the location and intensity of the pinwheel structure is determined by the binary parameters .",
    "@xcite argue further support for this model based on the discovery of a late - b - late - f supergiant coincident ( rms uncertainty of 0.03 arcsec , corresponding to 1.7 pc at @xmath271 mpc ) with the sn2001ig optical position which they interpret as the putative binary companion .",
    "however , in cases of observed pinwheel nebulae ( e.g. @xcite ) , the dust plumes are attributed to the strong wind - wind interaction between a wolf - rayet and o- or early - b star companion . taken together with the substantial uncertainty in the position of the putative companion ,",
    "this suggests that a binary induced pinwheel nebula for sn2001ig is not clearly substantiated .    adopting a pinwheel model for",
    "both sne 2003bg and 2001ig would imply that the geometry of their circumstellar nebulae are nearly identical and thus they share remarkably similar binary systems .",
    "moreover , this model would imply that our viewing angle with respect to their circumstellar nebulae must also be very similar .",
    "while this scenario can not be ruled out , it is clearly unlikely .    assuming a single star progenitor model , the mass loss rates derived through our ssa modeling for sne 2003bg and 2001ig imply massive wolf - rayet progenitors .",
    "broadband observations of galactic wr stars show that the circumstellar media for these events are often significantly disturbed .",
    "in particular , x - ray observations show evidence for colliding stellar winds and dense clumps ( e.g. @xcite ) . if the progenitors of sne 2003bg and 2001ig were single wr stars then the observed density variations could be produced by a series of enhanced mass loss episodes . to be consistent with the radio data",
    ", the mass loss ejections must ramp up as the star nears explosion . in this scenario , the observed variation timescale and the lack of csm structure at radii inward of @xmath272 cm",
    "may be explained by a quasi - periodic mechanism which drives enhanced mass loss episodes every @xmath269 years .",
    "if accompanied by wind velocity variations , these episodes could produce shells of circumstellar material , overall consistent with the circularly symmetric density structures we infer for sne 2003bg and 2001ig .",
    "the observed similarity between sne 2003bg and 2001ig implies that these mass loss episodes may be common among some fraction of hydrogen - poor events .",
    "these clues suggest that episodic variations in the progenitor mass loss rate and/or wind velocity provide a reasonable explanation to the radio light - curve variations observed for both sne 2003bg and 2001ig .",
    "given the predicted timescale for the mass ejections , these two sne provide some of the best evidence for unusual mass loss evolution immediately preceding the supernova explosion . while the presence of a binary companion can not be ruled out for either of these hydrogen - poor events , additional studies of short timescale variability in radio supernovae will enable discrimination between single and binary progenitor models .",
    "we report extensive radio and x - ray observations of sn2003bg .",
    "the spectroscopic evolution of this unusual supernova shows a transition from a broad - lined type ic to a hydrogen - rich type ii and later to a typical hydrogen - poor type ibc .",
    "this evolution strengthens the connection between type ii and type ibc ( including broad - lined ) events .",
    "we show that the extraordinarily luminous radio emission for a sn ibc is well described by a self - absorption dominated synchrotron spectrum while the observed x - ray emission at @xmath0 days is adequately fit by inverse compton scattering of the optical photons off of the synchrotron emitting electrons .",
    "our radio model implies a sub - relativistic ejecta velocity , @xmath1 , and a size of @xmath273 cm at @xmath2 days .",
    "this analysis emphasizes that broad optical absorption lines do not imply relativistic ejecta .",
    "we find that the total energy of the radio emitting region evolves as @xmath3 erg assuming equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields ( @xmath4 ) . the circumstellar density is well described by stellar wind profile , @xmath274 , with modest ( factor of @xmath5 ) episodic enhancements which produce abrupt achromatic flux variations .",
    "we show that free - free absorption does not contribute significantly to the radio spectrum and estimate an average mass loss rate of @xmath275 , consistent with observed values for local wolf - rayet stars .",
    "comparison with other events reveals that @xmath8 of radio supernovae show similar short timescale light - curve variations which are attributable to circumstellar density irregularities .",
    "this compilation emphasizes that abrupt radio light - curve variations can not be used as a reliable proxy for an engine - driven explosion , including off - axis gamma - ray bursts .    finally , the radio light - curves and spectroscopic evolution for sn2003bg are strikingly similar to those of sn2001ig , suggestive of a common progenitor evolution for these two events . the overall similarity of sne 2003bg and 2001ig to radio sne ibc is suggestive of a compact wolf - rayet progenitor model . based on the relative intensity of the inferred density enhancements ,",

    "<S> we report extensive radio and x - ray observations of sn2003bg whose spectroscopic evolution shows a transition from a broad - lined type ic to a hydrogen - rich type ii and later to a typical hydrogen - poor type ibc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the extraordinarily luminous radio emission is well described by a self - absorption dominated synchrotron spectrum while the observed x - ray emission at @xmath0 days is adequately fit by inverse compton scattering of the optical photons off of the synchrotron emitting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> our radio model implies a sub - relativistic ejecta velocity , @xmath1 , at @xmath2 days after the explosion which emphasizes that broad optical absorption lines do not imply relativistic ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the total energy of the radio emitting region evolves as @xmath3 erg assuming equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the circumstellar density is well described by a stellar wind profile with modest ( factor of @xmath5 ) episodic density enhancements which produce abrupt achromatic flux variations . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate an average mass loss rate of @xmath6 ( assuming a wind velocity of @xmath7 ) for the progenitor , consistent with the observed values for galactic wolf - rayet stars . comparison with other events reveals that @xmath8 of radio supernovae show similar short timescale flux variations attributable to circumstellar density irregularities . specifically , the radio light - curves of sn2003bg are strikingly similar to those of the type iib sn2001ig , suggestive of a common progenitor evolution for these two events . based on the relative intensity of the inferred density enhancements , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the progenitors of sne 2003bg and 2001ig experienced quasi - periodic mass loss episodes just prior to the sn explosion . </S>",
    "<S> finally , this study emphasizes that abrupt radio light - curve variations can not be used as a reliable proxy for an engine - driven explosion , including off - axis gamma - ray bursts . </S>"
