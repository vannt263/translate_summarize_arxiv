    "at the present time almost all fundamental physical phenomena could be formulated in the frameworks of either classical or quantum mechanics .",
    "that means that these phenomena admits the hamiltonian description , which due to its long history developed many powerful methods of analysis of the general properties of evolution of the systems and the tools for the solutions of partial problems .    in this respect",
    "the fluid mechanics stands aside ( in spite of its name ) from orthodox mechanics . the reasons for that",
    "is not only the infinite number of degrees of freedom of fluid which could be treated e.g. within classical field theory or statistical mechanics .",
    "the main difference between conventional field theory and continuous mechanics is that in the first case we can speak about the dynamics of the field at one point in space ( which of course interacts with the field at the neighboring points ) , while in the case of the fluid , describing the interaction of the neighboring particles which constitute the fluid we are loosing its position in the space due to the motion of fluid . in the same time",
    "the objective of usual problems of hydrodynamics is to define the velocity , density and a thermodynamical variable ( pressure or entropy ) as the functions of the coordinates @xmath1 and time @xmath2 for the appropriate boundary conditions and/or initial data @xcite .",
    "the similar problems also appear for magnetohydrodynamics dealing with sufficiently dense plasma @xcite . for the developing of the hamiltonian formalism we need to start with more detailed description based initially on the trajectories of constituents of media .",
    "this description is especially important for plasma , because the fundamental electromagnetic interaction could be formulated only in terms of the trajectories of the charges .",
    "needless to say that some aspects of this approach was extensively studied in the series of papers by j.marsden , a.weinstein , p.kupershmidt , d.nolm , t.ratiu and c.levermore @xcite especially in the context of stability problem .    of course not all properties of fluid",
    "could be formulated in the frameworks of the hamiltonian approach .",
    "for example , we leave open the question of the energy dissipation , viscosity et cetera .",
    "in fluid mechanics there are two different pictures of description .",
    "the first , usually refereed as eulerian , uses as the coordinates the space dependent fields of velocity , density and some thermodynamic variable .",
    "the second , lagrangian description , uses the coordinates of the particles @xmath3 labeled by the set of the parameters @xmath4 , which could be considered as the initial positions @xmath5 and time @xmath2 .",
    "these initial positions @xmath6 as well , as the coordinates @xmath3 belong to some domain @xmath7 . in sequel",
    "we shall consider only conservative systems , where the paths of different particles do not cross , therefore it is clear that the functions @xmath3 define a diffeomorphism of @xmath7 and the inverse functions @xmath8 should also exist .",
    "@xmath9 the density of the particles in space at time @xmath2 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the initial density at time @xmath12 .",
    "the velocity field @xmath13 as a function of coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the inverse function ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the velocity also could be written in the following form : @xmath16 or @xmath17 let us calculate the time derivative of the density using its definition ( [ 2 ] ) : @xmath18 in such a way we verify the continuity equation of fluid dynamics : @xmath19 .    using the coordinates",
    "@xmath3 as a configurational variables we can consider the simplest motion of the fluid described by the lagrangian @xmath20 the equations of motion which follow from ( [ 8 ] ) apparently are @xmath21 now let us find what does this equation mean for the density and velocity of the fluid .",
    "for that we shall differentiate both sides of ( [ 5 ] ) with respect to time @xmath22 the first term in the r.h.s . of ( [ 10 ] ) vanishes due to the equations of motion([9 ] ) and transforming the second in the same way , as we did in ( [ 6 ] ) we arrive at @xmath23 let us rewrite ( [ 11 ] ) in the following form : @xmath24\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\rho(x_i , t)\\bigl[\\dot{\\vec v}(x_i , t)+v_k(x_i , t)\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k } \\vec v ( x_i , t)\\bigr]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in ( [ 12 ] ) vanishes due to the continuity equation , while the second gives euler s equation in the case of the free flow : @xmath25    before moving further we need to make one comment concerning the lagrangian ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the reader may get an impression that this lagrangian depends not only on the dynamical variables at the time @xmath2 , but also at the initial time @xmath12 through the presence of @xmath26 . in order to eliminate the doubt let us take the unity @xmath27 and insert it into the integrand of ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "@xmath28 performing the integration in ( [ b ] ) over @xmath29 we obtain : @xmath30 this representation of the lagrangian ( [ 8 ] ) shows explicitly the dependence of @xmath31 only of the dynamical variables at the time @xmath2 ( besides we are not going to consider here the euler variables as an independent ) .    in order to have more realistic model of the fluid we need to introduce into the lagrangian ( [ 8 ] ) the `` potential energy '' term which will give rise to the internal pressure field in euler s equation .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the functions @xmath3 define a diffeomorphism in @xmath32 therefore the matrix @xmath33 is non - degenerate for any @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the integral ( [ 1 ] ) may be expressed via the jacobean  the determinant of @xmath34 : @xmath35 for some problems one can choose the initial density @xmath26 to be uniform in @xmath36 , and effectively normalize the density field @xmath37 by putting @xmath38 ( one particle in the elementary volume )",
    ". however , we prefer to keep @xmath26 arbitrary , because in the case e.g. the presence of soliton in the fluid the density could not be uniform at any time .",
    "taking the `` potential energy '' to be the functional of @xmath39 we can write the lagrangian in the following form : @xmath40.\\ ] ] in order the lagrangian be the functional of the dynamical variables at the time @xmath2 , the function @xmath41 , should has the following form : @xmath42 now the equations of motion become @xmath43 substituting @xmath44 from ( [ 18 ] ) to the equation([10 ] ) and acting as we did in the derivation of the equation ( [ 13 ] ) , we obtain @xmath45    it is now obvious that if we identify the @xmath46 with pressure @xmath47 , the equation ( [ 19 ] ) takes the form of usual euler equation without viscosity : @xmath48 for the function @xmath41 parameterized as in ( [ d ] ) , the pressure has the following form : @xmath49 the pressure @xmath47 which appeared here is the result of interaction between particles , which constitute the fluid .",
    "we can also add to the lagrangian ( [ 17 ] ) the term , which describes the interaction with an external field : @xmath50 and the euler equations take the form : @xmath51    as we shall see later the description in terms of lagrange variables is very convenient for introducing interaction between particles because in this picture the usual coordinates are the dynamical variables . for example , considering two components fluid  ions and electron , interacting with electromagnetic field we obtain the theory of plasma .",
    "introduction the interaction of particles , which constitute the fluid with color gluon field gives us the theory of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "very interesting system is the gravitating gas , where particles interact with each other through gravitation field .",
    "these different types of interaction changes the physical properties if the media , but all of them could be described within the common approach .",
    "the description of fluid in terms of lagrangian variables brings no difficulties in construction of canonical formalism . indeed , for the lagrangian ( [ 17 ] )",
    ", the canonical coordinates will be the functions @xmath3 and its conjugated momenta are defined as the derivatives of the lagrangian with respect to the velocities @xmath52 : @xmath53 the hamiltonian is given by the legendre transformation of the lagrangian : @xmath54 the canonical poisson brackets is defined by @xmath55 apparently the poisson brackets ( [ 1.3 ] ) and the hamiltonian ( [ 1.2 ] ) define the equations of motion for the canonical variables , which are equivalent to the lagrange equations .",
    "the phase space @xmath56 of the fluid is formed by @xmath57 .",
    "what is missing at the moment is the @xmath58-space interpretation of the variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 and the goal of this section is to find a canonical transformation of @xmath59 and @xmath60 to equivalent set of coordinates in @xmath56 , which are @xmath58-dependent functions .    let us introduce the new objects using the same averaging , as we used in the previous section @xmath61 the poisson brackets of @xmath62 , induced by ( [ 1.3 ] ) has the following form : @xmath63\\delta(\\vec x-\\vec y).\\ ] ] these poisson brackets was introduced geometrically as `` the hydrodynamic - type brackets '' long ago in the papers @xcite without physical explanation .",
    "the present discussion reveals the origin of these brackets .",
    "the commutation relation ( [ 1.5 ] ) coincides with algebra of 3-dimensional diffeomorphisms . in other words , @xmath62 are the generators of the finite diffeomorphism @xmath64 of any @xmath58-dependent dynamical variable in @xmath56 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the group of diffeomorphisms , generated by @xmath65 is not a gauge symmetry in case of fluid mechanics , as it is in the case of e.g. relativistic string or membrane . in the same time in fluid mechanics",
    "there is an infinite dimensional symmetry ( but not a gauge symmetry ) with respect to special ( i.e. volume preserving ) diffeomorphisms @xmath66 , which will be considered in later .",
    "let us leave for a moment @xmath62 and consider another @xmath58-dependent functions @xmath67 which are the inverse to @xmath68 functions ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "differentiating the first equation ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to @xmath58 we obtain : @xmath69 in other words , the matrix @xmath70 is inverse to @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , from ( [ 15 ] ) it follows that @xmath72 to simplify the calculation of the poisson brackets we can express @xmath73 in the following form : @xmath74 from ( [ 1.9 ] ) we easily obtain @xmath75 the calculation of the poisson brackets between @xmath73 and @xmath65 is more involved , but the result is simple : @xmath76 in such a way we have constructed the set of @xmath58-dependent coordinates @xmath77 in the phase space @xmath56 , but the transformation @xmath78 is not canonical .",
    "the set of canonical @xmath58-dependent coordinates in @xmath56 could be obtained in the following way .",
    "let us multiply both sides of ( [ 1.11 ] ) by matrix @xmath79 : @xmath80 where we have used ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",
    "further , due to the relation ( [ 1.10 ] ) , we can put @xmath79 inside the brackets and obtain : @xmath81 where @xmath82 by tedious , but direct calculation we also obtain @xmath83 so the set @xmath84 is formed by the canonical variables . in terms of these canonical variables the generators of the group of diffiomorphisms @xmath65 has the following form : @xmath85 for the lagrangian considered , from ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.4 ] ) follows that @xmath65 is given by @xmath86 and the representation ( [ 1.17 ] ) is very similar to clebsh parametrization @xcite of the velocity .",
    "the distinction of ( [ 1.17 ] ) from the original clebsh parametrization is the appearance of three `` potentials '' , instead of two , for the 3-dimensional fluid .",
    "the reason of this difference will be discussed in the end of this section .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian ( [ 1.2 ] ) should now be expressed in the terms of new variables @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , let us again insert the unity @xmath87 into the integrand ( [ 1.2 ] ) and change the order of integration : @xmath88 performing the integration over @xmath29 with the help of ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 1.4 ] ) we obtain : @xmath89 making use of ( [ 1.17 ] ) we can express @xmath90 via canonical variables @xmath84 : @xmath91 where the function @xmath92 for the `` potential '' part of the energy was introduced in ( [ d ] ) . for usual",
    "fluid or gas this term represents the internal energy of the fluid and it should vanish for uniform density distribution @xmath93 . a phenomenological expression for @xmath92 could be written as follows @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the deviation of the density from its homogeneous distribution : @xmath96 the first term in ( [ 1.27 ] ) is responsible for the sound wave in the fluid ( @xmath97 is the velocity of sound ) , the second term in ( [ 1.27 ] ) describes the dispersion of the sound waves .    in order to reveal the relation of the hamiltonian flow , generated by ( [ 1.26 ] ) with geodesic flow @xcite",
    "let us introduce the metric tensor @xmath98 : @xmath99 with this notation ( [ 1.26 ] ) takes the form : @xmath100 the metric tensor with upper indices @xmath101 denotes , as usually the inverse matrix and @xmath102 the representation ( [ 1.30 ] ) permit us to consider the hydrodynamics as the geodesic flow on the dynamical manifold with metric @xmath98 and many general properties of the hydrodynamics could be derived from this fact ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the lagrangian ( [ 17 ] ) possesses the invariance with respect to the `` volume preserving '' group of diffeomorphisms @xmath103 $ ] , where @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , let us write the lagrangian ( [ 17 ] ) in terms of the lagrangian density ( to simplify the equations , in this section we shall take the initial density @xmath38 ) @xmath104 and consider the transformations from @xmath103 $ ] of the coordinates @xmath105 @xmath106    @xmath107    apparently , due to ( [ 2.3 ] ) we obtain : @xmath108 and according to noether s theorem this invariance results in the existence of an infinite set of integrals of motion . to obtain these integrals we first need to find the parametrization of the transformations ( [ 2.2 ] ) , ( [ 2.3 ] ) in the vicinity of identity transformation : @xmath109 from ( [ 2.3 ] ) follows the equation for @xmath110 : @xmath111 further we must explicitly take into account that the volume preserving diffeomorphism ( [ 2.2 ] ) leaves the boundary of @xmath112 invariant .",
    "we shall limit ourself with the case when @xmath112 is formed by extraction of the domain with the differentiable boundary given by @xmath113 from @xmath32 .",
    "physically that means that we put in the fluid the fixed body , the shape of which is given by ( [ 2.7 ] ) .",
    "the condition that the infinitesimal diffeomorphism ( [ 2.5 ] ) preserves @xmath112 in this case is @xmath114 or @xmath115 geometrically equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) means that the vector @xmath116 is tangent to the surface , defined by ( [ 2.7 ] ) , because the vector @xmath117 is proportional to the normal @xmath118 of the surface ( [ 2.7 ] ) at the point @xmath4 .    from noether s theorem",
    "we obtain that the invariance of the lagrangian with respect to the transformation ( [ 2.5 ] ) gives the following conservation law : @xmath119 where @xmath120 satisfies to the conditions ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) .",
    "the existence of these conditions forbids to take the variation of the l.h.s . of ( [ 2.10 ] ) over @xmath120 and obtain the local form of integrals of motion . for",
    "that we need to extract from ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) the integral properties of @xmath120 .",
    "consider an arbitrary , single - valued , differentiable in @xmath112 function @xmath121 .",
    "then the following equations are valid : @xmath122 the first equality is valid due to condition ( [ 2.6 ] ) . using stokes",
    "theorem we can transform the integral of total derivative in the last equality ( [ 2.11 ] ) : @xmath123 where @xmath124 denotes the boundary of @xmath112 .",
    "the last integral in ( [ 2.12 ] ) vanishes due to condition ( [ 2.9 ] ) because the differential @xmath125 is proportional to the normal vector of the surface @xmath124 , defined by ( [ 2.7 ] ) . from ( [ 2.11 ] ) and ( [ 2.12 ] ) we conclude that @xmath126 for any smooth , differentiable @xmath121 .",
    "taking this property of @xmath110 into account we obtain from the conservation laws ( [ 2.10 ] ) that the quantities @xmath127 are conserved modulo some term which is the gradient of a scalar . in particular",

    "therefore we need to introduce another kind of averaging without explicit refereing to the @xmath135 coordinates . for that recall that under diffeomorphism a closed loop transforms into closed loop .",
    "then let us consider such a loop @xmath136 and a surface @xmath137 whose boundary is @xmath136 .",
    "the integral @xmath138 where the vector @xmath125 is as usually the area element times the vector , perpendicular to the surface , is conserved , because of the conservation of @xmath129 .",
    "further , from stokes theorem we have : @xmath139 changing the variables in ( [ 2.19 ] ) we obtain : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the image of the loop @xmath136 under diffeomorphism @xmath142 . the object ( [ 2.20 ] ) is very well known in hydrodynamics as the `` circulation '' and its conservation is known as w.thompson theorem @xcite .",
    "the relation of the circulation conservation with the invariance under special diffeomorphisms was first explicitly established in @xcite , though it also could be extracted from general discussion in appendix 2 of @xcite . in order to avoid confusion",
    "we should make a remark concerning the meaning of the contour integral ( [ 2.20 ] ) .",
    "the matter is that the diffeomorphism @xmath142 transforms a fixed loop @xmath136 into time dependent loop @xmath143 and while e.g. calculating the poisson brackets of @xmath144 with hamiltonian we need to differentiate not only the integrand , but also the contour .",
    "the explicit form of this integral is @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the contour @xmath136 . in this form",
    "it clearly seen that the circulation could not be expressed in terms only euler variables . in next section",
    "we shall come back to this issue and discuss the relation of the symmetry with respect to @xmath66 and euler description .",
    "conservation of circulation is not the only consequence of ( [ 2.10 ] ) .",
    "consider for example the case of 2-dimensional space . here , instead of the conserved vector @xmath129",
    "we shall have the conserved scalar @xmath147 this scalar defines the following integrals of motion : @xmath148 changing variables in ( [ 2.22 ] ) @xmath149 which is possible , because @xmath73 is a diffeomorphism of @xmath112 , we obtain : @xmath150 where the matrix @xmath151 was defined in ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "we can present @xmath152 as @xmath153 using the following property of 2-dimensional matrix @xmath151 : @xmath154 using the relation between @xmath155 and velocity we can rewrite the integrals of motion in case of 2-dimensional fluid in the following form : @xmath156 we see that the integrals @xmath152 are the functionals only of euler s variables .",
    "the consequences of this property will be discussed in the next section .    in the case of 3-dimensional space",
    "we can construct the analogous integrals of motion , integrating the products of the vector ( [ 2.15 ] ) : @xmath157 changing variables @xmath149 as above we shall obtain : @xmath158 in the 3-dimensional case the matrices @xmath159 satisfy the equation : @xmath160 therefore ( [ 2.28 ] ) takes the form : @xmath161 the integrals @xmath162 in ( [ 2.27 ] ) become @xmath163 apparently , due to the presence of @xmath164 in ( [ 2.30 ] ) , we can not in this case express ( [ 2.31 ] ) only in terms of velocity and density , i.e. the eulerian description does not admit this kind of integrals of motion .    in the 3-dimensional case",
    "there is one more integral , which does not exist in any other dimension .",
    "recall that the vector @xmath165 , given by ( [ 2.14 ] ) is conserved modulo gradient , therefore the integral @xmath166 is conserved because @xmath167 . transforming the @xmath168-dependent variables to the @xmath169-dependent ones in ( [ 2.32 ] ) we obtain helicity functional : @xmath170",
    "this section we shall discuss the relation of lagrange and euler description of hydrodynamics ( see also a very deep and interesting discussion in @xcite , there also could be found numerous references to the earlier investigations ) .    in our approach ,",
    "presented in section 3 the phase space of the 3-dimensional fluid is 6-dimensional ( @xmath171 ) , as it naturally follows from lagrange description .",
    "this could be compared with recent papers @xcite , where ( in our notations ) only @xmath172 and @xmath173 are regarded as the coordinates in the phase space ( this point of view of could be found also in different text books and articles ) see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    according to the conventional point of view the state of the fluid",
    "is determined by its velocity and density and therefore all other variables like ours @xmath135 are not needed . indeed , solving the euler equations of motion we can express the velocity @xmath174 and the density @xmath175 at time @xmath2 via the initial data @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "then , from the definition of @xmath174 ( [ 3 ] ) follows @xmath178 ( here we have suppressed the indices of the arguments for brevity ) .",
    "apparently we can solve these equations with respect to @xmath179 , provided we know the initial data @xmath180 .",
    "therefore it may seem that the variables @xmath181 are unnecessary , as it could be obtained through the others .",
    "but the initial data @xmath180 are half of the canonical variables in hamiltonian formalism .",
    "so , in our approach we indeed need more variables .",
    "these additional variables provide _ the complete description _ of the fluid in a sense that solving the equations of motion we define not only the @xmath182 and @xmath175 but also the trajectories of the particles which could not be obtained in the conventional formalism .",
    "the situation is analogous to the rigid body rotation : here the phase space @xmath56 is formed by 3 angles and 3 components of the angular momentum @xmath183 .",
    "as the hamiltonian depends on the components of @xmath183 only , we can consider separately the evolution of the angular momentum .",
    "this is incomplete description for this mechanical system .",
    "the complete one certainly should includes the evolution of the angles , which define the location of the rigid body in space .    in the case of fluid dynamics",
    "_ the complete description _ is to be done in the 6-dimensional phase space @xmath56 formed by @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( or @xmath186 and @xmath62 ) . if , as it is usually the case , the hamiltonian depends only on @xmath62 and @xmath187 , partial description in terms of the velocities and densities considered as `` relevant '' variables is possible .",
    "this means that we do not care about the evolution of the whole set of coordinates of the phase space which are considered as inessential .",
    "the `` relevant '' part of the coordinates does not necessarily form a simplectic subspace in @xmath56 .",
    "the non - degenerate poisson brackets in @xmath56 could become degenerate on the subset of @xmath56 , corresponding to the `` relevant '' variables .",
    "this is indeed the case in the rigid body and in the conventional fluid dynamics . in the first case the degeneracy of the algebra of poisson brackets for the `` relevant '' variables",
    " angular momentum is well known .",
    "its center element is the casimir operator of the rotation group .    in the case of fluid dynamics",
    "the algebra of the `` relevant '' variables  velocities and densities for arbitrary dimension has the following form : @xmath188 this algebra could be obtained from equations ( [ 1.5 ] ) , ( [ 1.10])and ( [ 1.11 ] ) .",
    "the center of this algebra is infinite - dimensional and its structure depends on the dimension of @xmath58-space . to find",
    "the center of it the following consideration could be useful . in the previous section we have considered the invariance of the fluid dynamics with respect to the infinite - dimensional group of special diffiomorphisms @xmath66 .",
    "this group acts on the lagrange variables , and in @xcite it was called `` relabeling symmetry '' .",
    "apparently , this transformations do not affect the euler s variables @xmath189 and @xmath172 .",
    "therefore these variables should have vanishing poisson brackets with the integrals of motion , corresponding to the invariance with respect to the special diffiomorphisms .",
    "indeed , the direct calculation gives : @xmath190 where we denote as @xmath191 tensor @xmath192 which contrary to the vector @xmath193 defined in the previous section , is appropriate for any dimensions .",
    "needless to say that the circulations ( [ 2.20 ] ) also commute with @xmath189 and @xmath172 .",
    "this observation gives us a guideline for the construction of the cental elements of the algebra ( [ 1.33 ] ) .",
    "indeed , if we could find a functional of @xmath191 , such that after transformation to @xmath58-dependent representation it will depend only of @xmath189 and @xmath172 , then it automatically falls into the center of ( [ 1.33 ] ) .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , in case of 2-dimensional fluid we were lucky and the integrals @xmath152 , given by ( [ g ] ) were expressed only via euler variables .",
    "therefore @xmath152 form the center , the fact which is known since long , see @xcite , @xcite for the discussion . here",
    "we want to note the remarkable fact : the symmetry , which is unknown to the variables @xmath189 and @xmath172 , helps to find the center of its algebra !",
    "the 3-dimensional case we shall consider in details in the next section . the casimirs which follow from the reasonings , given above are the `` helicity '' functional @xmath194 the other casimir is the total number of particles @xmath195(valid for any dimension , for @xmath196 ) : @xmath197",
    "the 3-dimensional case , which is very important for applications was considered by many authors starting from xix century .",
    "it is hardly possible to give an exhaustive list of references .",
    "recently it was discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier references ) where it was suggested to build hamiltonian formalism for 3-dimensional euler fluid using clebsh parametrization for the velocity : @xmath198 where the new functions @xmath199 together with density @xmath200 are used for the construction of the coordinates of the phase space .",
    "what we are going to suggest here is an alternative approach , which has certain advantages @xcite .",
    "let us consider a mechanical system which is described by a pair of complex coordinates which belong to @xmath201:@xmath202 , where @xmath203 .",
    "the lagrangian for this system we shall take in the following form : @xmath204 where we assume the summation over indexes .",
    "the canonical momenta , corresponding to the variables @xmath205 are given by equations ( from now on we again will suppress the time argument ) @xmath206 as it expected for the lagrangian which is a linear function of velocities , the equations ( [ 4.3 ] ) define the constraints on the canonical variables : @xmath207 the poisson brackets of the constraints are non - degenerate @xmath208 and we can use these constraints to eliminate canonical momenta @xmath209 using dirac procedure @xcite .",
    "the resulting poisson ( dirac ) brackets for the rest of coordinates of the phase space @xmath210 are : @xmath211 the hamiltonian , corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ 4.2 ] ) has the following form @xmath212\\ ] ]    now we shall explain why we consider this system .",

    "the point is that if we shall calculate the poisson brackets for ( [ 4.8 ] ) , using ( [ 4.6 ] ) the result will exactly coincide with ( [ 1.33 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath90 , given by ( [ 4.7 ] ) , being expressed via @xmath214 and @xmath215 will take the following form : @xmath216,\\ ] ] which also coincides with hamiltonian given by ( [ 1.25 ] ) .    the equations of motion for the variable @xmath217 have the usual form : @xmath218 apparently , the correct equations of motion , including the continuity equation for variables @xmath189 and @xmath215 follow from ( [ 4.10 ] ) .    as was mentioned above",
    ", the description of the fluid in terms of @xmath219 is rather similar to the description which uses clebsh parametrization .",
    "indeed , these variables could be presented in the following form : @xmath220 from where we obtain the representation for the velocity through angles @xmath221 and @xmath222 @xmath223 these equation defines the velocity , if clebsh parameters are known . also , as is well - known ( see e.g.@xcite,@xcite )",
    "any differentiable vector field @xmath189 has the local representation ( [ 4.12 ] ) .",
    "in other words , knowing @xmath214 , we can construct clebsh parameters @xmath224 with some ambiguity .",
    "this ambiguity arises as a set of integration constants . in our construction",
    "this ambiguity could be understand as follows .",
    "the lagrangian function ( [ 4.2 ] ) we consider is invariant with respect to the symmetry group @xmath225 which acts as follows : @xmath226 and according to noether s theorem the integrals of motion , which is the generators of these transformations are : @xmath227 the transformations ( [ 4.14 ] ) change the clebsh variables , but does not affect the euler s variables .",
    "so , in particular , the constant shift of the angle @xmath228 is generated by ex - casimir @xmath195 , which in @xmath210 has lost its status , the generator @xmath229 shifts the angle @xmath230 , the other two generators mix the angles @xmath230 and @xmath222 .",
    "so the system described by variables @xmath231 is a hamiltonian system with symmetry and we can reduce its phase space by procedure given by souriau @xcite and marsden and weinstain @xcite .",
    "the reduced phase space is the space , where `` live '' almost all the euler variables .",
    "the latter means that the procedure of reduction implies fixing the integrals of motion , in particular @xmath232 does not anymore belongs to the set of variables .",
    "the only problem we have now is the `` helicity '' functional , which still the is the casimir and the reduction does not remove it . for finite dimensional systems the existence of casimir implies the degerancy of poisson brackets .",
    "it could be easily seen from the following consideration . by definition",
    "the casimir @xmath233 should has a vanishing brackets with all variable @xmath234 where @xmath235 are all set of coordinates of the phase space . if the poisson brackets are non - degenerate , the equations ( [ 4.15 ] ) mean that @xmath233 is a constant",
    "the situation for the infinite dimensional system is different because of existence of so called the functionals with zero variation .",
    "consider for example an infinite dimensional system , which is described by the set of canonical variables @xmath236 where @xmath237 .",
    "the poisson brackets are non - degenerate : @xmath238 in this case we can easily construct a nontrivial functional , which will have vanishing poisson brackets with all variables @xmath236 .",
    "it has the following form : @xmath239 and has a meaning of a winding number for the phase of the complex variable @xmath240 , i.e. @xmath233 is what physicists used to call topological charge .",
    "note that in order for @xmath233 to be the casimir it is not necessary to impose the condition on @xmath241 and compactify @xmath242 . in this case",
    "@xmath233 will take an integer values and indeed will be the winding number .",
    "the `` helicity '' functional has the same origin as the functional @xmath233 in this example . in order to see it let us introduce a unit four vector @xmath243 @xcite : @xmath244 this four vector maps @xmath245 , provided we impose on the variables @xmath246 the asymptotic conditions : @xmath247 , when @xmath248 and compactify @xmath249 .",
    "the helicity functional @xmath250 given by ( [ 1.35 ] ) could be written in the following form : @xmath251 which is the standard representation for the winding number of the map @xmath245 , so called hopf invariant . here",
    "again we should note that even if we neglect the asymptotic conditions on @xmath252 together with compactification of @xmath249 , @xmath250 is invariant with respect to local variations and therefore has vanishing poisson brackets with @xmath253 .",
    "so , the conclusion of these arguments is that for infinite dimensional mechanical systems the existence of casimirs does not necessary implies the degeneracy of poisson brackets , provided these casimirs are related to the geometric properties of the phase space and the helicity belongs to this class of `` friendly '' casimirs .",
    "we shall consider plasma as a fluid of two components , namely electrons with mass @xmath254 and electric charge @xmath255 and ions with mass @xmath256 and charge @xmath257 .",
    "the coordinates of electrons we shall denote as @xmath135 , while the coordinates of ions will be @xmath258 . the interaction of the components of the plasma with the electromagnetic field @xmath259 is governed by the following lagrangian : @xmath260\\nonumber\\\\ & -e\\int d^3\\xi\\biggl[a_0(\\vec x(\\xi_i , t))-\\dot { \\vec x}(\\xi_i , t)\\vec a(\\vec x(\\xi_i , t))\\biggr]\\nonumber\\\\ & -\\frac{1}{4}\\displaystyle \\int d^3 x f^{\\mu\\nu}(x , t)f_{\\mu\\nu}(x , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath261 and @xmath262 are `` free '' lagrangian @xmath263,\\nonumber\\\\ & l_0^{ion}=\\displaystyle\\int d^3 \\xi\\biggl[\\frac{m\\dot{\\vec x}^2(\\xi_i , t)}{2}-f^{ion}(det\\frac{\\partial x_j(\\xi_i , t)}{\\partial \\xi_k})\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath264 denotes the electromagnetic field tensor : @xmath265 the advantage of lagrangian description of fluid ( plasma ) is clear . using of the coordinates of charged particles as the fundamental variables allows to introduce the interaction with electromagnetic field .",

    "following our consideration of a fluid in the section 3 , we can introduce the canonical coordinates @xmath286 for electron and @xmath287 for ion components of the plasma : @xmath288 for which @xmath289 substituting ( [ 3.14 ] ) into ( [ 3.12 ] ) we obtain the hamiltonian in terms of the canonical variables .    the lagrangian ( [ 3.1 ] ) is invariant with respect to the volume preserving diffeomorphisms of both components of plasma separately , so we shall have in this case two sets of conservation laws ",
    "one for electrons , the other for ions .",
    "applying the procedure , which we have described in the previous section we shall construct the conserved circulations : @xmath290 where @xmath291 and @xmath292 are given by ( [ 3.14 ] ) . in the same way we can construct the analogues of the integrals ( [ 2.31 ] ) and",
    "( [ 2.33 ] ) for this case .",
    "note that in the case of plasma the equation ( [ 1.18 ] ) is not valid due to the presence of the electromagnetic field , instead we have : @xmath293 therefore the equations ( [ 3.15 ] ) are not the circulations of the velocities . in the same time , adding circulations @xmath294 and @xmath295 on the common contour @xmath141 we obtain : @xmath296 so the total circulation of elections and ions velocities is conserved even in the presence of the electromagnetic interaction .",

    "for example the poisson brackets for the velocities of electrons take the following form : @xmath298\\delta(\\vec x-\\vec y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the same way are changed the poisson brackets of the velocities of ions , while the brackets involving densities are not changed .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite we have considered the hamiltonian formalism for fluid and gas based on the lagrangian description . it was pointed out in this paper that apart from other advantages , the lagrangian description , which uses the trajectories of the particles of fluid ( gas ) as the dynamical variables , is the most convenient for the introduction of interaction . in particular in the previous section",
    "it was demonstrated how the introduction of the electromagnetic interaction of particles which constitute the fluid , provide us with the theory of plasma . in the present paper we are going to consider in analogous way the theory of gas of particles which interact with each other through gravitational newton potential .",
    "the system of such particles could be considered as a model for the motion of stars in a galaxy when the gravitation interaction prevails all other interaction .",

    "there appears a natural desire to consider a continuous distribution of the particles as it is done in the theory of fluid or gas @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of the continuous system of particles interacting through kepler potential has the following form : @xmath305 where @xmath306 denotes the gravitational constant . comparing [ [ 5.2 ] ] with [ [ 17 ] ]",
    "we see that the only difference is in the form of `` potential energy '' therefore the canonical formalism for gravitating gas essentially the same , as for fluid .",
    "in such a way we can immediately write the hamiltonian of gravitating gas : @xmath307 inserting into the integrals in the r.h.s of [ [ 5.3 ] ] the unity @xmath308 as we did in the * section 3 * we can rewrite [ [ 5.3 ] ] via @xmath58-dependent variables : @xmath309 certainly the attractive interaction between particles will dramatically change the properties of gravitating gas    the equations of motion , which follow from the lagrangian ( [ 5.2 ] ) have the form : @xmath310 translating equation ( [ 15 ] ) on to the language of euler variables , as has been done above we arrive at the following set , including the continuity equation : @xmath311 note that the r.h.s of the equation ( 16 ) in the case of ordinary gas or fluid is expressed through the internal pressure @xmath312 ; @xmath313 the set ( 16),(17 ) defines the evolution of initial distribution of @xmath314 of gravitating gas and , besides it could be used to find the static configuration of this gas for different boundary conditions . in particular we can explore the possibility of the existence of the static isolated configurations of gravitating gas .",
    "isolation here means that density @xmath172 vanishes at infinity .",
    "note , that for usual fluid , gas or plasma these kind of solutions are forbidden due to virial arguments , known in the case of plasma as shafranov s theorem @xcite,@xcite . for the gas , describing by equation ( [ 18 ] )",
    "this theorem could be proven as follows .",
    "first , using the continuity equation let us rewrite equation ( [ 18 ] ) for static case in the following form : @xmath315=0.\\ ] ] integrating ( [ 19 ] ) with @xmath169 over @xmath32 we obtain : @xmath316=\\\\ \\nonumber & \\int d^3 x \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}\\biggl(x_j\\biggl[\\rho(x_i)v_k(x_i)v_j(x_j)+\\delta_{jk}p(x_i \\biggr ] \\biggr)-\\\\ \\nonumber & \\int d^3 x \\delta_{jk}\\biggl[\\rho(x_i)v_k(x_i)v_j(x_j)+\\delta_{jk}p(x_i)\\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for usual gases @xmath317 , therefore the integral over divergence will vanish for isolated solutions for which @xmath318 when @xmath319 and we the obtain the following equation : @xmath320=0.\\ ] ] apparently , this equation could be satisfied only for the case @xmath321 , i.e. there is no isolated in the above formulated sense , static solutions of the equation ( [ 18 ] ) . in order to have a static solution of ( [ 18 ] ) we need to change the boundary condition @xmath318 to the condition @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is asymptotic uniform density .",
    "now we shall show that the arguments of this theorem bring no obstacles for gravitating gas .",
    "for this we again will rewrite the equations ( 16 ) for the static case , using continuity equation in the following form : @xmath324=0,\\ ] ] integrating ( [ 22 ] ) with @xmath325 over @xmath32 we obtain : @xmath326=0.\\ ] ] consider the first term of the integrand in ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "integrating by parts as above and taking into account the asymptotic conditions for @xmath172 we obtain : @xmath327 integration of the second term of the integrand in ( [ 23 ] ) is straightforward , yielding @xmath328 in such a way from equation ( [ 23 ] ) we obtain : @xmath329 this relation apparently could be satisfied for non - trivial configurations of @xmath330 .",
    "the energy functional , corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ 14 ] ) has the following form : @xmath331 the two terms of the energy functional have clear interpretation as kinetic @xmath144 and potential @xmath332 parts of energy and equation ( [ 23 ] ) expresses famous `` virial theorem '' @xcite : @xmath333 note here , that in the `` virial theorem '' equation ( [ 28 ] ) holds true for mean values of kinetic and potential energies , while in our case of static solutions there is no need to average over time .    using the relation ( [ 28 ] ) we can easily find the total energy of static configuration of the gravitating gas : @xmath334",
    "so , the total energy of the static solution is negative , as for the bound state of kepler problem .",
    "the equations which define our static configurations of gravitating gas have the following form : @xmath335 taking divergence of the first equation : @xmath336 we can write the whole set of the equations for static configuration in a pure local form : @xmath337 where the last equation requires the expression @xmath338 to be a gradient .",
    "now we are going to derive an important inequality , which bounds the @xmath339 of any solution of ( [ 32 ] ) from below .",
    "for this let us introduce the notation for the potential @xmath340 : @xmath341 integrating by parts we obtain the following relation : @xmath342 using ( [ 34 ] ) we can write the expression for the energy given by ( [ 29 ] ) of any static configuration , which is the solution of ( [ 32 ] ) in the following form : @xmath343 substituting into ( [ 35 ] ) the expression for the gradient of the potential @xmath340 from the first equation ( [ 30 ] ) , we obtain the expression for the @xmath344 only through the field of velocity : @xmath345 this form is most convenient for the derivation of desired inequality .",
    "now let us consider a function @xmath346 from the hilbert space @xmath347 , which consists of all measurable functions on @xmath32 , which have at least one derivative and square integrable on @xmath32 together with its derivatives .",
    "in particular we assume that the density @xmath172 belongs to @xmath347 .",
    "taking into account the equation ( [ 31 ] ) we have @xmath348 where on the last step we have used cauchy inequality . from ( [ 37 ] ) we immediately obtain the inequality : @xmath349 which is valid for any @xmath346 from @xmath350 and is saturated for @xmath351 .",
    "indeed , let us calculate the derivative of the functional in the r.h.s of ( [ 38 ] ) with respect to @xmath346 : @xmath352.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this derivative vanishes for @xmath353 given by @xmath354 where @xmath233 and @xmath355 are inessential constants , which do not enter into the functional .",
    "it is easy to prove that the second variation of this functional is negative on the @xmath356 , so this function provides the absolute maximum for the functional and due to the equations ( [ 34]-[36 ] ) its value coincides with the l.h.s . of (",
    "however , the function @xmath356 does not belong to the hilbert space @xmath347 , because the potential @xmath340 has the asymptotic behavior @xmath357 at infinity and therefore is not square integrable .",
    "the integral @xmath358 which enters into inequality ( [ 38 ] ) could be written in the following form @xmath359 where we denoted as @xmath360 the normalized function @xmath346 : @xmath361 in the hilbert space @xmath347 the hlder s inequality holds true : @xmath362 as well , as the remarkable ladyjenskaya s @xcite inequality : @xmath363 here we use the standard notations : @xmath364 from these two inequalities we obtain the following bound for the integral @xmath358 : @xmath365 ) is bounded from below by appropriate norm of the density .",
    "indeed , the absolute maximum of the functional @xmath366 should be bigger when its maximum in a restricted space like @xmath347 , given by ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "however we can not present the rigorous proof of this statement .",
    "one of the other general property of a static configurations of gas or fluid is the existence of the topological charge  `` helicity '' ( or hopf invariant ) , which explicit form is @xmath367 this object is not only the integral of motion of the equations ( 16 ) but it also is the central element of the algebra of poisson brackets of @xmath368 @xcite .",
    "the existence of such an object brings additional argument for the stability of the solitons .",
    "the role of `` helicity '' in the case of the solitons in plasma was pointed out in @xcite,@xcite . moreover , in @xcite it was shown that there exists a remarkable inequality which bounds the energy of plasma solitons from below by @xmath369 .",
    "the derivation of such inequality for our case ( and in general for fluid solitons ) is highly desirable and we going to consider this question in the future publications .",
    "the equations ( [ 32 ] ) which define the static configurations of gravitating gas are 3-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations and the probability to find an analytic solution is very low .",
    "the only case where a class of solutions was found in a similar situation is the thooft - polaykov monopole , but there the requirement of the spherical symmetry simplified essentially the problem . in our case",
    "we can not expect the spherically symmetric solution because the continuity equation requires the trajectories of the particles be closed in order to provide the static configuration for @xmath370 .",
    "the simplest and most symmetric configuration we could expect for our case is the toroidal structure , where the density is concentrated in the vicinity of the axis of the toroid , while the field of velocity is tangential to the embedded one into the other toroidal surfaces .",
    "it is not the first time the toroidal - shape soliton appeared in the context of the theory of continuous media .",
    "since the pioneer works of lord kelvin in xix century to the present time it was studied by many scientists both mathematician and physicists and recently the interest to the subject was again attracted by the works of faddeev and niemi @xcite,@xcite    it is clear that in the case of attractive gravitational interaction the particles , which constitute the gas move around the region with bigger density ( like planets around the sun ) so there should exists a collective motion in the approximation when the radius of torus tends to infinity and we can speak about cylindrical rather when toroidal configuration . indeed , let us consider this axially symmetric tornado - like solution of ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "for that we shall write the ansazt : @xmath371 where @xmath372 .",
    "the second and the third equations ( [ 32 ] ) are satisfied by ( [ 47 ] ) , while the first gives @xmath373 this solution shows that the density stays an arbitrary function ( what is expected for the partial differential equations ) and the velocity grows with radius up to its asymptotic value .",
    "the later is the consequence of the approximation here we actually have 2-dimensional potential @xmath374 instead of coulomb @xmath375 .",
    "this example is to demonstrate that the particles which constitute the gravitating gas in their collective motion form the localized object .",
    "the traditional way to tackle 3-dimensional gas or fluid is to introduce for the velocity clebsh parametrization suggested in @xcite and recently discussed in@xcite . in general case this parametrization has the following form : @xmath376 where @xmath377 are scalar functions . for the toroidal solution with @xmath378  as the axis of symmetry we shall assume that the density @xmath379 does not depend upon the azimuth angle @xmath380 and clebsh parametrization takes the form : @xmath381 where @xmath382 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath383 in fluid dynamics the parametrization ( [ 50 ] ) has an interesting mechanical interpretation which we shall discuss elsewhere .",
    "the `` helicity '' functional for this case has the following form @xmath384 the function @xmath385 in ( [ 50 ] ) should has a singularity at the point @xmath386 in the semi - plane @xmath387 where @xmath388 is the radius of axis line of the torus .",
    "when the point @xmath387 goes around @xmath386 , the function @xmath385 increases on @xmath389 .",
    "the gradient of such function will be the vector tangential to the toroidal surfaces .",
    "the addition of the gradient of azimuthal angle @xmath380 makes the velocity ( [ 50 ] ) winding also in the azimuth direction .",
    "such a behavior of the field of velocity leads to the nontrivial hopf invariant , which characterizes the homotopy classes @xmath390 .",
    "described this way the clebsh parameters , together with the density @xmath172 could be found by numerical integration of the equations ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "the construction we presented and discussed above would be incomplete and too academic without an example of the galaxy which indeed may demonstrate the toroidal structure . fortunately such galaxy does exists .",
    "it was discovered back in 1950 by art hoag and recently a very good picture was obtained by hubble telescope ( see figure 1 ) . on this picture",
    "clearly seen the toroidal structure . in the gallery of the galaxies which is available on the sites http://www.astronomy.com or http://hubblesite.ogr we can find some other examples with the form more or less close to the torus , but",
    "the hoag s object is the best of all .",
    "here we have considered different aspects of hamiltonian formalism for several types of continuous media  gas , fluid , plasma and gravitational gas . in spite of different properties of these media ,",
    "all of it could be treated within universal formalism and difference arises due to specific interaction between constituents . as it was shown",
    "the lagrangian approach provides the simplest way to introduce different types if interaction because it uses coordinates of particles as basic variables .",
    "having constructed lagrangian formalism we can derive euler equations of motion and also the whole set of poisson brackets for euler variables .",
    "the @xmath0 formalism of continuous media considered in section 6 gives a frameworks for quantum theory which may be useful for the description of bose - einstein condensation in gas and this subject needs further in - depth study .",
    "another subject which we are going to explore in the future is the theory of gravitating gas .",
