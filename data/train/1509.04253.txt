    "the seminal work of leonid keldysh @xcite has paved the way to modern understanding of quantum systems out of equilibrium .",
    "one can do much work in the area armed just with fermi golden rule and some defiance , yet a consistently scientific approach will almost necessary involve the keldysh formalism .",
    "the formalism has been successfully applied for derivations of dynamical equations of complex systems where intuition ceases to work , like superconductors @xcite , strongly correlated systems @xcite , non - linear sigma - models @xcite .    for many years",
    "the formalism was considered too much complicated for a practical researcher and hardly applied beyond several specific fields .",
    " keldysh approach  sounded as a synonym of unnecessary theorization and an antonym to clear physical reasoning .",
    "one of us ( y.n ) remembers a talk given by a high - class theorist with a taste for abstract models , young experimentalists being his primary audience .",
    "somewhere in the middle of the talk he said :  now let us move to physical quantities , namely , keldysh green functions  . a burst of laugh lasted for more than five minutes .",
    "the situation begun to change in nineties , and is quite different nowadays .",
    "the formalism receives much more practical attention , more and more theorists and numerical researchers become qualified , nice modern reviews @xcite have appeared in addition to the classical ones @xcite .",
    "a unique property of keldysh formalism that distinguishes it from all other diagrammatic techniques @xcite is that the zero - order approximation is generally unstable with respect to perturbative corrections .",
    "this property is widely appreciated now and makes the technique an indispensable tool for complex quantum dynamics .",
    "recent extensions of keldysh technique to non - unitary evolution of density matrix @xcite allow to access non - trivial problems of quantum statistics and analyze large deviations from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "finite - element approach to keldysh green functions for electrons , so - called quantum circuit theory @xcite proved to be useful to built adequate models of quantum nanostructures .",
    "keldysh technique permits natural formulation in terms of path integrals @xcite providing a very instructive picture of  doubling  a classical stochastic variable when put on the keldysh contour .",
    "this provides a fundamental link between keldysh and feymann - vernon formalism .",
    "the keldysh action arising in this context can be evaluated by blocks , each block being obtained from a non - unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "the landauer - buttiker @xcite scattering approach receives a compact and general formulation in terms of keldysh action @xcite    all these extensions are still based on time evolution along a single `` doubled '' keldysh contour . in this paper , we discuss a recent extension in a different direction .",
    "technically , the extension involves time evolution along many `` doubled '' contours .",
    "we will refer to these pairs of contours as parallel worlds ( this terminology has nothing to do with an attempt of interpretation of quantum mechanics involving parallel worlds ) .",
    "the closing of the contours is typically different for different sub - parts of the quantum system under consideration : for some , the contours are closed separately within each world , while for others they can go back and forth through all the worlds .    as we show below",
    ", this formalism is natural and indispensable for evaluating the quantities that are non - linear in the density matrix .",
    "the physical meaning of such quantities is not obvious since they do not conform the standard definition of a physical observable , although they are commonly used in quantum information theory @xcite , for instance , for entanglement characterization .",
    "most work and applications have been done for evaluation of renyi entropies @xcite .",
    "we follow these papers in our outlining .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ standard ]",
    "we formulate the standard keldysh formalism in a way convenient for further presentation , putting emphasis on the link between keldysh technique and master or bloch equations . in section",
    "[ extended ] we explain the extension of the formalism on non - unitary evolution mostly concentrating on the example of full counting statistics of energy flows @xcite that is useful in the context of renyi entropy flows .",
    "then we explain the use of parallel worlds concept for evaluation of the conserving quantities related to the products of density matrices of sub - parts ( section [ why ] ) and formulate the diagrammatic technique for this situation in section [ dia ] .",
    "the relations between different keldysh correlators for a ( sub)system in thermal equilibrium , so - called kms @xcite relations , are important for single - world techniques .",
    "we discuss its generalization on multiple worlds in section [ sec : kms ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to specific examples for which the general theory can be simplified and elaborated .",
    "we concentrate on second - order diagrams in section [ secondorder ] and explain the specifics of higher - order diagrams in section [ higherorder ] .",
    "we shortly review our recent results on quantum heat engines in section [ qhe ] . in section [ exact ]",
    "we discuss a rather general correspondence between the statistics of the energy flows and renyi entropy flows .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us first formulate the standard keldysh formalism in a way that illustrates its potential and at the same time makes direct connections with the problems to be considered further in the text .",
    "the starting point of the formalism is the formal expression for unitary time evolution of the density matrix @xmath0 of a quantum system governed by a ( generally time - dependent ) hamiltonian @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath3 denote time(anti)ordering in the evolution exponents .",
    "if we were up to exact quantum evolution of the whole system , we would not need any keldysh technique : a schr'odinder equation would suffice . at the same time , the resulting density matrix would keep the memory of the initial one for infinite time .",
    "this is rather unphysical . to address physical situations , we need to separate quantum variables onto relevant and less relevant ones .",
    "quite generally , it can be achieved by _ bipartition _ of the hilbert space : we present it as a direct product @xmath4 of two subparts @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian is separated as @xmath7 @xmath8 being an operator that involves degrees of freedom in both subspaces , while @xmath9 work in their respective partitions only .",
    "this opens up the opportunities to treat a great variety of physical situations .",
    "for instance , the system @xmath5 can be a small system with finite number of states while @xmath6 can be an environment with infinite number of degrees of freedom . in this case",
    ", the density matrix of @xmath6 can be regarded as unchangeable in the course of evolution and will play a role of ( thermal ) reservoir for @xmath5 : the density matrix @xmath10 will try to adjust to the reservoirs .",
    "alternatively , @xmath6 can be a collection of independent reservoirs kept at different conditions(like temperatures and chemical potentials ) : the system @xmath5 will try to adjust to these competing reservoirs providing the flows of physical quantities , e.g. charge or heat , between the reservoirs .",
    "yet another possibility is that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are both reservoirs and @xmath11 representing a junction between the two . in this case , both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unchangeable , while the junction provides the flows to both reservoirs .",
    "we will assume that the completely separated systems , whose dynamics are governed by @xmath14 , form a reasonable zero - order approximation and implement a perturbation technique in @xmath8 keeping the calculations as general as possible .",
    "we assume `` adiabatic switching '' of the perturbation @xcite : far in the past the coupling is absent , and the density matrix is a direct product over subspaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath15 here we label the states in subspaces @xmath5",
    "( @xmath6 ) with latin ( greek ) indexes . )",
    "the coupling slowly grows achieving actual values at time long before @xmath16 .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix is given by @xmath17 @xmath18 is taken here in interaction representation .",
    "expanding this in @xmath19 gives perturbation series most conveniently presented as diagrams involving the keldysh contour ( fig.[fig : commonkeldysh ] ) .",
    "the operators in perturbation series are ordered along the contour .",
    "two parts of the contour correspond to time evolution of bra s and ket s in the density matrix .",
    "the crosses represent the ( time - dependent ) perturbation @xmath20 at a certain time moment . the integration over time moments of all perturbations",
    "is implied .",
    "there is a state index associated with each piece of the contour .",
    "since @xmath21 is diagonal , this index does not change when passing this element .",
    "the index changes if a non - diagonal matrix element of the perturbation is involved .",
    "summation over the indices is implied .        in distinction from most perturbation theories ,",
    "the zero - order approximation in keldysh formalism is not stable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "for instance , if @xmath5 is small and @xmath6 is a reservoir , @xmath22 is determined by the reservoir at arbitrary small coupling strength and can have nothing to do with the initial @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that we need to re - sum the perturbation series . in a single world",
    ", there is a simple way to re - sum the perturbation series and arrive at a master equation that contains only diagonal elements of density matrix ( fig .",
    "[ fig : masterequation ] ) . for a diagram ,",
    "we split the time - line by perturbations into the blocks as shown in the figure .",
    "the blocks come in two sorts : diagonal ones , that have the same state index on both contours , and non - diagonal ones . to compute a diagramm",
    ", we need to integrate over time duration of each block . for non - diagonal blocks ,",
    "the integrand is an oscillatory function of time and the integral has a chance to converge . for non - diagonal blocks , the integrand is a constant , and integration diverges .",
    "this indicates that the diagrams need to be resumed .",
    "if we look at time derivative of the density matrix , it is contributed by the first non - diagonal block .",
    "summation over the subsequent diagonal blocks replaces @xmath21 with the density matrix at time moment right after the first non - diagonal block . with this , the evolution equation for diagonal matrix elements @xmath24 can be written as ( assuming summation over the repeating indices ) @xmath25 @xmath26 being the sum of the perturbation expansion comprising a non - diagonal block that starts from the second order in @xmath8 .",
    "it is natural to require that the matrix elements of @xmath11 are only non - diagonal , that is , @xmath27 if either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 changes slowly in comparison with the typical time - scale of the blocks , one can neglect this time - dependence under the integration sign .",
    "the integration over time duration of the blocks with different indices gives the transition rates @xmath31 .",
    "the unitarity guarantees that the integration over time duration of the blocks with the same indices gives @xmath32 the total transition rate from the state @xmath33 , that is the sum of the partial transition rates , @xmath34 . in this way , we come to the master equation in the traditional form ,    @xmath35    there are situations when the non - diagonal elements of density matrix are also relevant for dynamics .",
    "for instance , a relevant subset of quantum states in @xmath5 can be approximately degenerate such that their energy separations are of the order of the rates @xmath36 or such degeneracy is provided by a coherent drive with a frequency that cancels the energy separations .",
    "a generic example is the quantum heat engine described in section [ qhe ] .",
    "let us treat the system @xmath6 as a reservoir for the system @xmath5 and sum up over its states assuming unchanged @xmath37 . instead of the diagonal blocks , we define the blocks where the states at two parts of the contour belong to the relevant subset for @xmath5 and the same state for @xmath6 .",
    "after the re - summation over these blocks , the evolution of the density matrix in the relevant subset is given by @xmath38 here @xmath39 is an operator accounting for a weak degeneracy lifting in the relevant set and typically includes the coherent drive . under assumptions of slow change of this matrix , @xmath40",
    ", one can perform integration over the time duration @xmath41 of the blocks to arrive at bloch equation in its traditional local - in - time form , @xmath42 the common feature of the equations ( [ eq : re - summation1]),([eq : master]),([eq : re - summation2]),([eq : bloch ] ) is the existence of the stationary solution .",
    "mathematically , the linear operator acting on a density matrix in the right hand side of the equations has a zero eigenvalue .",
    "the existence of the stationary solution is obvious from physical reasons and is a consequence of unitary dynamics .",
    "the system approaches the stationary solution no matter from what initial condition it started its evolution , it forgets the initial conditions .",
    "as we will see , the extensions of the keldysh formalism typically do not have a stationary solution .",
    "the extended keldysh technique is formally defined through an evolution with the hamiltonians @xmath43 that are different at forward and backward part of the keldysh contour @xcite . @xmath44 while this equation is very similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantumevolution ] ) , the evolution for different hamiltonians is not unitary . consequently , @xmath45 is not a density matrix , in particular , its trace is not @xmath46 .",
    "it is natural to call it a pseudo - density matrix .",
    "apparently , it is not physical : what is the physical use of it ?",
    "let us set the hamiltonians to @xmath47 , and compute the trace @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "this depends on the values of @xmath49 for all time moments preceding @xmath16 , @xmath48\\equiv \\exp({\\cal s}\\{\\chi^{\\pm}(\\tau)\\})$ ] . by expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : extendedquantumevolution ] ) in @xmath49 one sees that the @xmath50 is nothing but the generating function of all possible keldysh cumulants of the operator @xmath51 taken at different moments of time .",
    "therefore , it completely characterizes the time - dependet quantum fluctuations .",
    "the functional @xmath50 is called keldysh action and is routinely applied in the context of path - integral formulation of the formalism @xcite . in this case , @xmath52 describes a sub - system subject to a quantum field @xmath53 that typically arises in the course of path - integral representation of this variable , and @xmath50describes the response and back - action of the sub - system on this field .",
    "it can be used as a block in feymann - vernon action that describes the fluctuation dynamics of the field @xcite .",
    "another application of the extended keldysh formalism is the full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite .",
    "let us set @xmath54 , @xmath55 being a constant in time interval @xmath56 and is called counting field .",
    "the expansion of the keldysh action in @xmath55 produces the keldysh - time - ordered cumulants of the quantum variable @xmath57 . under certain conditions",
    "@xcite , the inverse of this generating function gives the probability of a change @xmath58 of this variable during the time interval , @xmath59 this technique has been implemented for fcs of the charge transferred between the reservoirs .",
    "@xcite    an accurate definition of fcs for conserving quantities implements a gauge transform in a bipartition .",
    "let us consider an operator of a conserving quantity @xmath60 that is separable in the bipartition , @xmath61 .",
    "let us define a unitary transformation @xmath62 and the hamiltonians on two parts of the contour as @xmath63 since @xmath9 commute with @xmath60 , the coupling @xmath11 is the only part modified by this transform , @xmath64 the evolution of the pseudo - density matrix is given by an extension of eq .",
    "( [ eq : habevolution ] ) , @xmath65 trace of @xmath45 defines a keldysh action @xmath66 that gives the statistics of transfers of the quantity @xmath60 to / from the subsystem @xmath5 .",
    "this can describe the statistics of conserved quantities such as current and energy flows , the latter is of a special interest for us . in this case , the conserving quantity is the energy @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the unitary transform is equivalent to time - shift of the operators in the interaction representation",
    ". the coupling @xmath8 can be quite generally presented as a sum of the products of the operators @xmath68 working in the corresponding subspaces , @xmath69 .",
    "the modified @xmath8 then reads @xmath70    the re - summation of the perturbation series made in the previous section is also relevant and shall be made for extended keldysh formalism .",
    "the analogue equations can be derived . importantly , since the dynamics is non - unitary , the blocks and rates do not satisfy sum rules imposed by unitarity and are generally dependent on counting fields . for instance , in the extended master equation ( c.f . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) ) , @xmath71 @xmath72 .    owing to this",
    ", there is no stationary solution to these equations even for stationary counting fields .",
    "the diagonalization of the linear evolution operator gives a set of the solutions of the form @xmath73 , @xmath74 being the eigenvalues of the operator . in the long time limit",
    ", the general solution will be given by the eigenvalue with the smallest real part,@xmath75 .",
    "this gives a remarkably simple and constructive expression for keldysh action in the limit of long time intervals @xmath76 , @xmath77",
    "although this fact is rarely discussed , in addition to physical conserving quantities that are presented by operators there are conserving quantities that are characteristics of a density matrix .",
    "they are formally unphysical since they are not associated with any physical operator observable .",
    "an example is provided by the rnyi entropies that are defined as traces of integer powers of the density matrix of a closed system@xmath0 , @xmath78 since the quantum evolution of the system is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath79 and @xmath80,\\ ] ] the density matrices in different momets of time are related by unitary transform and the trace of any power of @xmath0 does not depend on time , @xmath81 .",
    "the definition can be obviously extended to non - integer @xmath82 .",
    "the more common shannon entropy is obtained by taking the limit @xmath83 we note that the @xmath84 is an extensive quantity proportional to the system volume .",
    "let us now return to the context of bipartition . for two systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we can now define two sets of rnyi entropies , @xmath85 where the reduced density matrices in two subspaces are defined via the partial traces in these subspaces , @xmath86 if the quantum evolutions of the systems are completely independent , @xmath87 @xmath9 being operators involving the corresponding subspaces only , the entropies of both sets provide the conserved measures , @xmath88    if we take into account the coupling @xmath89 , the rnyi entropies are not conserved anymore .",
    "let us assume at the moment the systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 are infitely large and are characterized by continuous excitation spectrum while @xmath11 couples a relatively small number of degrees of freedom in both systems .",
    "this situation is similar to that of two metallic leads kept at different chemical potentials and containing practically infinite number of electrons . if the leads are connected by a small junction , finite electric current flows through the junction , while the distribution of electrons in infinite leads remains unchanged . from this analogy ,",
    "it is natural to conjecture that a finite rnyi entropy flow , re - flow , flows between the subsystems @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we define the flows as time derivatives of extensive quantities , @xmath90 owing to conservation of rneyi entropy in each system , the re - flows would not depend on exact bipartition of the system and are determined by properties of the coupling that is in principle described by @xmath8 rather then by the properties of the systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in full analogy with electric current .",
    "there is , however , an important difference . for physical quantities",
    "the conservation holds in the whole system as well as in each subsystems . for instance , elecrtical currents to each lead must satisfy @xmath91 .",
    "as far as rnyi entropies are concerned , there is no exact conservation law for a sum @xmath92 at finite @xmath8 , although these quatities are extensive .",
    "there is a conservation law for the total rnyi entropy @xmath93 .",
    "however , the latter at finite @xmath8 is the sum @xmath92 only approximately , up to the terms proportional to the volume of the system .",
    "therefore , in general @xmath94    how to compute the flows ?",
    "the crucial observation is that the standard keldysh formalism as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : habevolution ] ) can be straightforwardly generalized to any integer number @xmath82 of density matrices .",
    "these matrices undergo independent unitary evolution in time interval @xmath95 .",
    "it is constructive to think of a set of @xmath82  parallel worlds  and draw the diagrams for perturbation series using @xmath82 parallel bra- and ket - contours . to compute @xmath96 with this set , we first need to split the contours to account for possibly different ordering of operators in subspaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( black and white curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 m ] that gives the example for @xmath97 ) . then we need to _ reconnect _ the contours at @xmath98 .",

    "two perturbations are located in different worlds .",
    "collecting all diagrams ( see appendix b in @xcite ) , we obtain for @xmath224 the following expression : @xmath225    thus the r - flow is naturally separated onto two parts , which come from _ incoherent _ and _ coherent _ diagrams .",

    "the entropy flow is not directly related to energy flow . rather , @xmath241 the difference is due to quantum coherent effects in our heat engine .",
    "similar relation holds for the renyi entropy flow in the low - temperature limit @xmath242 ( this limit does not commute with @xmath243 since @xmath244 diverges at low temperatures ) . in the absence of coherent effects",

    "such simple interpretation does not work since @xmath224 can be negative @xcite .",
    "another example of the keldysh multi - world formalism is a relation which we derive for coherent and incoherent second - order diagrams in general time - dependent situation .",
    "this relation gives an exact correspondence between formally unphysical re - flows and physical observables , namely , the full counting statistics of energy transfers considered in section [ extended ] .    as discussed in section",
    "[ why ] , the renyi entropies in quantum physics are considered unphysical , or non - observable , due to their nonlinear dependence on density matrix .",
    "such quantities can not be determined from immediate measurements ; instead their quantification seems to be equivalent to determining the density matrix .",
    "this requires reinitialization of the density matrix between many successive measurements .",
    "therefore the flows of renyi entropy between systems are the conserved measures of non - physical quantities .",
    "an interesting and non - trivial question is : is there any relation between the flows of renyi entropy and the physical flows ?",
    "an idea of such relation was first put forward by levitov and klich in @xcite , where they proposed that the shannon entropy flow can be quantified from the measurement of full counting statistics ( fcs ) of charge transfers .",
    "the validity of this relation is restricted to vanishing temperature and obviously to the systems where interaction occurs by means of charge transfer . in this section",
    "we present a relation which is similar in spirit , for details see @xcite .",
    "let us consider two quantum systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the system @xmath5 is infinitely large and is kept in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath126 .",
    "the system @xmath6 is arbitrary : it can encompass several degrees of freedom as well as infinitely many of those .",
    "it does not have to be in thermal equilibrium and in general is subject to time - dependent forces .",
    "it is convenient to assume that these forces are periodic with period @xmath41 .",
    "however this period does not enter explicitly in formulation of our result , which is also valid for aperiodic forces .",
    "the only requirement is that there is a stationary limit of the flows of physical quantities to the system @xmath5 .",
    "the stationary limit is defined by averaging the instant flow over the period @xmath41 . for aperiodic forces",
    "it is determined by averaging over sufficiently long time interval .",
    "the energy transfer is statistical . in section",
    "[ extended ] we discussed the full counting statistics of energy transfers .",
    "the fcs of energy transfer in system @xmath5 during the time interval @xmath246 $ ] can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : habevolutionextended ] ) . for quantification of the renyi entropy flow",
    "we need to define an _",
    "auxiliary _ fcs of energy transfer .",
    "the most general interaction hamiltonian is @xmath247 with @xmath248 being operators in the space of the system in thermal equilibrium , and @xmath249 being those in the space of the arbitrary system .",
    "let us replace @xmath249 with their _ average _ values @xmath250 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is that of the equilibrium system subject to time dependent external forces .",
    "those induce energy transfers to the system to be characterized by a fcs .",
    "we discuss below possible physical realization of the scheme .",
    "so we have two fcss . in the limit of long @xmath76 , their cumulant - generating functions(keldysh actions )",
    "are proportional to the time interval , @xmath251 ( incoherent ) and @xmath252 ( coherent ) , @xmath253 being the counting field of energy transfer to / from the system @xmath5 .",
    "our main result is the following exact correspondence : @xmath254 which indicates that the renyi entropy flow of the order @xmath82 to the system kept at temperature @xmath255 is exactly equal to the difference of the fcs of incoherent and coherent energy transfers to the system kept at temperature @xmath256 at the fixed characteristic parameter @xmath257 .",
    "this relation is valid in the limit of weak coupling , where the interaction between the systems can be treated perturbatively .",
    "there is an obvious classical limit for the case where the quantum system b is considered to be classical .",
    "all operators @xmath249 are numbers corresponding to classical forces acting on the system in thermal equilibrium . in this case",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by the hamiltonian in degrees of freedom of the system and therefore will be unitary . in this case there will be no entropy flow .",
    "this can be separately understood only from looking into the fcs in the the correspondence ( [ eq . corres ] ) : in this case @xmath258 .",
    "the entropy / fcs correspondence ( [ eq . corres ] ) allows us to quantify the time flow of renyi as well as shannon entropy .",
    "these quantities are not accessible in direct measurement as they are non - linear functions of density matrix",
    ". direct measurements of density matrix for a probe environment requires characterization of reduced density matrix of an infinite system , which is a rather non - trivial procedure and needs the complete and precise reinitialization of the initial density matrix .",
    "however , measuring the entropy flow from the correspondence requires that some generating functions are extracted from determining statistical cumulants of transferred energy in experimental data .",
    "this can be done equally well for imaginary and real values of the characteristic parameter .",
    "the measurement procedures may be complex , yet doable and physical",
    ".    the correspondence can have many other advantages ; for instance : a complete understanding of entropy flows may help to identify the sources of fidelity loss in quantum communications and methods to prevent or control them .",
    "we have formulated and illustrated here a fascinating extension of keldysh formalism on multiple parallel worlds .",
    "keldysh contours in this scheme are different for different sub - parts of a quantum system , this provides dependencies between the worlds .",
    "we explain that the formalism naturally arises in the context of characterization of the flows of conserved measures : rnyi entropies , and illustrate its similarities with single - world extensions of keldysh formalism .",
    "it is a big honour for us to present these results in a special issue celebrating numerous scientific merits of leonid veniaminovich keldysh .",
