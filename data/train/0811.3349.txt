    "the radio continuum emission correlates extremely well with the optical dss r and ir 60 @xmath33 m images .",
    "interference effects from nearby cas a limit our ability to reliably determine the spectral index between the two cgps radio frequencies , however the spectral index between 1420 mhz ( cgps ) and 2700 mhz ( f@xmath144rst et al . 1990 ) is consistent with thermal emission .",
    "a partial ring of co emission in the range 56 to 43  is seen to circumscribe the optical , ir ( 60 @xmath33 m ) and radio continuum emission of sg13 .",
    "this range of velocities is consistent with previously measured velocity determinations by lozinskaya et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and pedlar ( 1980 ) , based on optical lines and the h166 radio recombination line , respectively .",
    "an of the spatial distribution of ir point sources having colours characteristic of ysos shows that an excess of such sources appears projected over the molecular ring surrounding sg13 , suggesting that star formation triggered by the stellar members of mrk 50 , in particular wr 157 , is taking place .",
    "the kinematics and dynamics of the gas , dust and molecular material around sg13 are entirely compatible with the hypothesis that the wr star alone is responsible for shaping the ism around the open cluster mrk 50 .",
    "a 50@xmath9 diameter  shell ( shell a ) is detected in the 32 to 50  range to the north of sg13 .",
    "although this range partially overlaps the velocity range of the co ring surrounding sg13 , this  structure is entirely distinct from the other structures ( molecular ring , optical , ir and radio continuum ) .",
    "the star wr157 appears projected onto the southern boundary of this  shell .",
    "an expansion velocity of 13@xmath162  is inferred from a velocity - position diagram .",

    "we conclude that these two cavities or shells are unlikely to be physically related to sg13 .",
