    "this paper is concerned with traveling wave solutions for a class of nonlinear dispersive equations of the form @xmath4_x + { \\mathcal{l}}u_x = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a self - adjoint operator , and @xmath2 is a real - valued function with @xmath5 and which satisfies certain growth conditions .",
    "equations of this form arise routinely in the study of wave problems in fluid mechanics and mony other contexts .",
    "a prototype of such an equation is the kdv equation that appears if @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the current work , the operator @xmath1 is considered to be given as a fourier multiplier operator , such as for instance in the benjamin ",
    "ono equation , which arises in the study of interfacial waves . in this case , the fourier multiplier operator is given by @xmath8 , where the hilbert transform @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 we also study in detail traveling wave solutions of the whitham equation , which appears when @xmath1 is given by convolution with the integral kernel @xmath11 in the form @xmath12 and @xmath2 is the same function as in the kdv equation .",
    "the particular form of equation   exhibits the competing effects of dispersion and nonlinearity , which gives rise to a host of interesting phenomena .",
    "the most well known special phenomenon is the existence of solitary waves and of periodic traveling waves containing higher fourier modes . indeed",
    ", note that in the purely dispersive model @xmath13 , the only possible permanent progressive waves are simple sinusoidal waves , while in the nonlinear model   higher fourier modes must be considered to obtain solutions .",
    "the order of the operator @xmath14 appearing in   has a major effect on the types of solutions that may be found . a higher - order operator , such as in the korteweg  de vries equation , acts as a smoothing operator because of its effect of spreading different frequency components out due to a strongly varying phase speed  @xcite .",
    "lower - order operators such as the operator @xmath11 in   appearing in the whitham equation may allow solutions to develop singularities , such as derivative blow - up ( see  @xcite ) and formation of cusps ( see  @xcite ) .    on the other hand , highly nonlinear functions @xmath15 may lead to @xmath16-blow - up .",
    "for instance , the generalized kdv equation which is written in normalized form as @xmath17 features global existence of solutions for @xmath18 , but the solutions blow - up in the critical case @xmath19 ( the case @xmath20 is open ) . in the case of the generalized benjamin ",
    "ono equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hilbert transform , numerical evidence points to singularity formation for @xmath23  @xcite , but no proofs are available at this time .    in order to study different phenomena related to equations of the form   and their traveling wave solutions , a _ python_-based solver package was developed by the authors  @xcite .",
    "the general idea behind the solver is to use a numerical continuation method  @xcite implemented with a pseudo - spectral algorithm .",
    "similar previous projects include  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "is written in _",
    "c _ , whereas is written in _",
    "fortran_. both programs are efficient and very general , as they are able to cover a wide range of problems involving bifurcation analyses .",
    "however , from a user s perspective , such a generality coupled with low level programming languages may lead to some difficulty for users of these programs to utilize them efficiently .",
    "is designed to provide researchers with a simple yet effective tool for investigating problems on traveling waves .",
    "the package is flexible , and its functionality can be easily expanded .",
    "the availability of the notebook @xcite makes the solver very interactive , so that it should be easier for new users to get started .    in order to maximize ease of use , was designed to find even solutions of  .",
    "symmetry of steady solutions can be proved for some of the models in the form  , but nor for all  @xcite .",
    "some of these equations also admit non - smooth solutions , for instance as termination points of a bifurcation branch .",
    "this happens for exmple for the whitham equation , which features bifurcation curves which terminate in a solution with a cusp  @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to investigate the precise nature of the termination of the bifurcation curve .",
    "the content of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "a mathematical description of the numerical method of is given in .",
    "presents results of different experiments carried out with the package .",

    "contains a schematic of program and a description of its workflow .",
    "to compute traveling wave solutions to the equation   the following ansatz is employed : @xmath24 thus , the equation takes the form @xmath25 ' + { \\mathcal{l}}\\phi ' = 0,\\ ] ] which can be integrated to give @xmath26 the constant @xmath27 is a priori undetermined .",
    "one may set the @xmath27 equal to zero as a way of normalizing the solutions .",
    "another option is to impose an additional condition , for example that the integral of @xmath28 over one wavelength be zero . in this case",
    ", @xmath27 will be found along with the solution @xmath28 .",
    "we consider @xmath1 as a fourier multiplier operator with symbol @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath2 is at least twice differentiable , and we have @xmath5 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . when computing traveling wave solutions we focus on even periodic solutions .",
    "while it can be proved in ome cases that solutions of   must be even , this is not known for a general operator @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , we make this assumption here in order to make the numerical procedure as uniform as possible . for even periodic solutions",
    ", one may use a cosine collocation instead of a fourier method . in particular , using the cosine functions as basis elements automatically removes the inherent symmetries due to reflective and translational symmetry .",
    "moreover , the number of unknowns is reduced by a factor of @xmath32 , and the problem of the asymmetric arrangement of nodes in the fft is circumvented .",
    "of course , all these problems could also be dealt with a collocation method based on the fourier basis , but the cosine basis does all of the above automatically .",
    "in addition , the _ python _ cosine transform is based on an integrated algorithm , which relies on an optimized version of the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) .",
    "the following description of computation scheme was presented in detail in  @xcite , but we will briefly repeat it here for consistency of the manuscript . for the purpose of clarity , we will refer to full wavelength @xmath33 of a solution as fundamental wavelength , and a half of fundamental wavelength will be called wavelength . such a definition",
    "is required because the method computes a half of a solution profile , the other half is automatically constructed due to symmetry .",
    "traveling wave solutions to the equation   are to be computed in the form of a linear combination of cosine functions of different wave - numbers , i.e. , in the space @xmath34 this is a subspace of @xmath35 , and the collocation points @xmath36 for @xmath37 are used to discretize the domain . if the required fundamental wavelength of solutions is to be @xmath38 , one can use a scaling on the @xmath39-variable . defining the new variable @xmath40 yields collocation points @xmath41 and wavenumbers @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 we are seeking a function @xmath44 that satisfies the equations @xmath45 at the collocation points @xmath41 .",
    "the operator @xmath46 is the discrete form of the operator @xmath1 , and @xmath47 is the discrete cosine representation of @xmath28 which is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the scaled wavenumbers , and @xmath50 are the discrete cosine coefficients .",
    "as the equation   is enforced at the collocation points @xmath41 , one may evaluate the term @xmath51 using the matrix @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fourier multiplier function of the operator @xmath1 .",
    "the equation   enforced at @xmath55 collocation points yields a nonlinear system of @xmath55 equations in @xmath55 unknowns , which can be written in shorthand as @xmath56 this system can be solved by a standard iterative method , such as newton s method . in this system ,",
    "the value of phase speed @xmath57 has to be fixed for computing one particular solution .",
    "such an approach becomes impractical when a turning point on the bifurcation curve appears .    in a different approach",
    "is employed : both the amplitude @xmath58 and the phase speed @xmath57 of a solution are treated as functions of a parameter @xmath59 : @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is to be computed from the system  .",
    "this construction makes is possible to follow turning points on the bifurcation branch with relative ease .",
    "having computed two solutions , i.e. , two points on the bifurcation curve @xmath62 and @xmath63 , one may find a direction vector @xmath64 of the line that contains these points : @xmath65 then the point @xmath66 is fixed at some ( small ) distance @xmath67 from the point @xmath68 in the direction @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 the point @xmath71 plays the role of the initial guess for velocity and amplitude when computing the next solution @xmath72 .",
    "the solution point @xmath73 is required to lay on the line with direction vector @xmath74 , which is orthogonal to the vector @xmath69 . @xmath75",

    "the variable @xmath59 is computed by newton s method from the extended system @xmath76 here , a nonhomogeneous problem ( @xmath77 ) is considered .",
    "the equation @xmath78 makes the waveheight of the computed solution to be that of @xmath58 .",
    "the equation @xmath79 is called the _ boundary condition_. it allows to enforce different specifications on the computed traveling wave solution .",
    "for example , if one sets @xmath80 then _ the mean of the computed wave over a period will have to be equal to zero_. one may also experiment with @xmath81 to consider the homogeneous problem @xmath82",
    ". it can be also interesting to set @xmath83 this enables us to compute traveling wave solutions that mimic solitary wave solutions .          in order to test the numerical implementation of the discretization ,",

    "solitary wave solutions are treated as traveling waves with sufficiently long wavelength that have the wave trough at zero . in case of the kdv equation",

    "ono equation with @xmath92 , @xmath19 and @xmath93 were approximated in  @xcite with a standard newton scheme .",
    "the solutions in  @xcite were not very accurate , but since singularity formation of the evolution equations the accuracy of the solitary - wave approximation was not an important issue .",
    "the problem with the method of  @xcite and some other works was that the fft used here was not purged of possible symmetries ( translational and reflective ) . in the current code , since a cosine formulation is chosen , these symmetries are automatically eliminated , and the resulting computations are able to to render more accurate approximations .",
    "solitary - wave solutions of these equation could be computed with higher accuracy using a type of petviashvili method in  @xcite , but here we emply the package using the boundary equation  , and treating solitary waves as traveling waves with sufficiently long wavelength that have wave trough at zero .",
    "once these high - accuracy solutions are found , they are aligned in an evolution code using a high - order time integrator , and the interaction of two waves is studied .",
    "two question are investigated .",
    "first , the interaction is investigated for evidence of integrability .",
    "second , we are looking for possible annihilation of one of the waves , such as may happen in some other evolution equations  @xcite",
    ".    a possible approach to studying the question of complete integrability is analyzing the interaction of two solitary wave solutions of the equation , such as carried out in  @xcite for other nonlocal equations . in the snapshots of interaction of two solitary waves at different times",
    "are shown .",
    "the time difference between two consecutive snapshots is constant .",
    "as it may be observed , during the process of interaction , the two initial solitary waves combine into a single wave , and an additional oscillation is produced .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the interaction of solitary waves is not elastic and the modified benjamin ",
    "ono equation may not be integrable .",
    "in addition , it appears that the smaller wave disappears as most of its mass is acquired by the larger wave .",
    "thus one may argue that the small wave is annihilated by the larger wave .",
    "the benjamin equation was found by benjamin  @xcite as a model for two - layer flow in the case when the interface is subject to surface tension . the approximation may not be a good model for a stratified situation , but more applicable to the case where two fluids are separated by a sharp interface .",
    "the equation is @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a parameter similar to the bond number in free surface flow  @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "a study relating to the effects of competing dispersion operators on the shape of periodic traveling waves in the benjamin equation is presented .",
    "an in - depth study of solitary waves was carried out in  @xcite .",

    "the branches denoted by @xmath108 and @xmath106 originate from the same bifurcation point , located at @xmath109 and zero waveheight .",
    "these two branches continue in different directions , due to differences in wavelength .",
    "in particular , the @xmath106 branch contains waves with shorter wavelengths , and falls into the capillary regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath108 branch falls in the gravity regime .",
    "as the waveheight grows , solutions on the @xmath106 branch first cross the @xmath105 branch without connecting .",

    "<S> in nonlinear dispersive evolution equations , the competing effects of nonlinearity and dispersion make a number of interesting phenomena possible . in the current work , </S>",
    "<S> the focus is on the numerical approximation of traveling - wave solutions of such equations . </S>",
    "<S> we describe our efforts to write a dedicated code which is able to compute traveling - wave solutions of nonlinear dispersive equations of the general form @xmath0_{x } + { \\mathcal{l}}u_x = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a self - adjoint operator , and @xmath2 is a real - valued function with @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the code uses a continuation method coupled with a spectral projection to compute approximations of steady symmetric solutions of this equation . </S>",
    "<S> the code is used in a number of situations to gain an understanding of traveling - wave solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the first case is the whitham equation , where numerical evidence points to the conclusion that the main bifurcation branch features three distinct points of interest , namely a turning point , a point of stability inversion , and a terminal point which corresponds to a cusped wave .    </S>",
    "<S> the second case is the so - called modified benjamin  </S>",
    "<S> ono equation where the interaction of two solitary waves is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that is possible for two solitary waves to interact in such a way that the smaller wave is annihilated . </S>",
    "<S> the third case concerns the benjamin equation which features two competing dispersive operators . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that bifurcation curves of periodic traveling - wave solutions may cross and connect high up on the branch in the nonlinear regime . </S>"
