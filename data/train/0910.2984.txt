    "it is by now well - established that neutrinos are massive and mixed , and that these properties lead to the oscillations observed in measurements of neutrinos produced in the sun  @xcite@xcite , in the atmosphere  @xcite , by accelerators  @xcite , and by reactors  @xcite .",
    "the mixing model predicts not only neutrino oscillations in vacuum , but also the effects of matter on the oscillation probabilities ( the ` msw ' effect )  @xcite . to date , the effects of matter have only been studied in the solar sector , where the neutrinos passage through the core of both the sun and the earth can produce detectable effects .",
    "the model predicts three observable consequences for solar neutrinos : a suppression of the @xmath6 survival probability below the average vacuum value of @xmath16 for high - energy ( @xmath4b ) neutrinos , a transition region between matter - dominated and vacuum - dominated oscillations , and a regeneration of @xmath6s as the neutrinos pass through the core of the earth ( the day / night effect ) .",
    "in addition to improved precision in the extraction of the total flux of @xmath4b neutrinos from the sun , an advantage of the low energy threshold analysis ( leta ) presented here is the enhanced ability to explore the msw - predicted transition region and , in addition , more stringent testing of theories of non - standard interactions that affect the shape and position of the predicted rise in survival probability  @xcite@xcite .",
    "we present in this article a joint analysis of the data from the first two data acquisition phases of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) , down to an effective electron kinetic energy of @xmath0  mev , the lowest analysis energy threshold yet achieved for the extraction of neutrino signals with the water cherenkov technique .",
    "the previous ( higher threshold ) analyses of the two data sets have been documented extensively elsewhere  @xcite , and so we focus here on the improvements made to calibrations and analysis techniques to reduce the threshold and increase the precision of the results .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : detector ] with an overview of the sno detector and physics processes , and provide an overview of the data analysis in section  [ sec : anal_overview ] . in section  [ sec : dataset ]",
    "we briefly describe the sno phase  i and phase  ii data sets used here .",
    "section  [ sec : montecarlo ] describes changes to the monte carlo detector model that provides the distributions used to fit our data , and section  [ sec : hitcal ] describes the improvements made to the hit - level calibrations of pmt times and charges that allow us to eliminate some important backgrounds .",
    "sections  [ sec : recon]-  [ sec : beta14 ] describe our methods for determining observables like position and energy , and estimating their systematic uncertainties .",
    "section  [ sec : cuts ] describes the cuts we apply to our data set , while section  [ sec : treff ] discusses the trigger efficiency and section  [ sec : ncap ] presents the neutron capture efficiency and its systematic uncertainties .",
    "we provide a detailed discussion of all background constraints and distributions in section  [ sec : backgrounds ] .",
    "section  [ sec : sigex ] describes our ` signal extraction ' fits to the data sets to determine the neutrino fluxes , and section  [ sec : results ] gives our results for the fluxes and mixing parameters .",
    "sno was an imaging cherenkov detector using heavy water ( @xmath10h@xmath17o , hereafter d@xmath17o ) as both the interaction and detection medium  @xcite .",
    "sno was located in vale inco s creighton mine , at @xmath18 n latitude , @xmath19 w longitude .",
    "the detector was 1783  m below sea level with an overburden of 5890 meters water equivalent , deep enough that the rate of cosmic - ray muons passing through the entire active volume was just 3 per hour .",
    "one thousand metric tons ( tonnes ) of d@xmath17o was contained in a 12  m diameter transparent acrylic vessel ( av ) .",
    "cherenkov light produced by neutrino interactions and radioactive backgrounds was detected by an array of 9456 hamamatsu model r1408 20  cm photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , supported by a stainless steel geodesic sphere ( the pmt support structure or psup ) .",
    "each pmt was surrounded by a light concentrator ( a ` reflector ' ) , which increased the effective photocathode coverage to nearly @xmath20% .",
    "the channel discriminator thresholds were set to 1/4 of a photoelectron of charge . over seven kilotonnes ( 7@xmath21  kg ) of h@xmath17o shielded the d@xmath17o from external radioactive backgrounds : 1.7  kt between the av and the psup , and 5.7  kt between the psup and the surrounding rock .",
    "extensive purification systems were used to purify both the d@xmath17o and the h@xmath17o .",
    "the h@xmath17o outside the psup was viewed by 91 outward - facing 20  cm pmts that were used to identify cosmic - ray muons .",
    "an additional 23 pmts were arranged in a rectangular array and suspended in the outer h@xmath17o region to view the neck of the av .",
    "they were used primarily to reject events not associated with cherenkov light production , such as static discharges in the neck .",
    "the detector was equipped with a versatile calibration - source deployment system that could place radioactive and optical sources over a large range of the @xmath22-@xmath23 and @xmath24-@xmath23 planes ( where @xmath23 is the central axis of the detector ) within the d@xmath17o volume .",
    "deployed sources included a diffuse multi - wavelength laser that was used to measure pmt timing and optical parameters ( the ` laserball ' )  @xcite , a @xmath25n source that provided a triggered sample of 6.13  mev @xmath26s  @xcite , and a @xmath4li source that delivered tagged @xmath27s with an endpoint near 14  mev  @xcite . in addition , 19.8  mev @xmath26s were provided by a @xmath28 ( ` pt ' ) source  @xcite and neutrons by a @xmath29cf source .",
    "some of the sources were also deployed on vertical lines in the h@xmath17o between the av and psup .",
    "` spikes ' of radioactivity ( @xmath30na and @xmath31rn ) were added at times to the light water and d@xmath17o volumes to obtain additional calibration data .",
    "table  [ tbl : cal_sources ] lists the primary calibration sources used in this analysis ."
