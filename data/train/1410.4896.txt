    "delay required to communicate message @xmath0 from a source to a destination , is a key metric for communication networks .",
    "however , evaluating the optimal delay required to deliver the message in a network is not widely considered as it is very difficult to evaluate delay even in networks where no security constraint is imposed on a message .",
    "we consider a two - relay network with a secrecy constraint on a message , and do not make any assumption on the statistics of the source - to - relay channels , even on the existence of it .",
    "we evaluate the minimum delay required to communicate the message to the destination reliably and securely , and find the algorithm that achieves it .",
    "the two - relay network we consider is depicted in figure  [ dd ] .",
    "the goal of the source is to communicate a _",
    "finite _ size message @xmath0 to the destination , while keeping it secret from the relays .",
    "source - to - relay 1 and source - to - relay 2 channels are assumed to be block erasure channels , and the states of relay channels change one block to the next in an _",
    "arbitrary manner_. furthermore , we assume there is no direct channel from source to the destination , and both relay 1-to - destination and relay 2-to - destination channels are assumed to be noiseless .",
    "we study this communication model under three set - ups each of which has a different channel state information ( csi ) assumption : 1 ) genie - aided csi set - up : the source obtains the whole channel state sequence of the relay channels before the communication starts , 2 ) zero - block - delayed csi set - up : the source obtains the state of the relay channels at the beginning of a block , and 3 ) one - block delayed csi set - up : the source obtains the state of the relay channel with a 1 block delayed feedback .",
    "we evaluate the minimum number of channel blocks required to communicate message securely and reliably .",
    "the main challenge in our problem stems from the fact that since we delay with delay , we focus on the transmission of a message with _ a finite and fixed size_. hence , we can not employ traditional asymptotic approaches @xcite to show the message is communicated securely and reliably , since such approaches focus on large message sizes .",
    "to that end , we propose encoding strategies for each csi set - up to communicate the finite size message reliably and securely to the destination .",
    "our contributions are as follows :    * we provide an encoding strategy to achieve the optimal delay of genie aided csi set - up and optimal delay of zero - block delayed set - up @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the optimal delays of two set - ups are equal .",
    "* we bound the optimal delay of the one - block delayed csi set - up .",
    "we show that the optimal delay of the one - block delayed csi set - up differs from that of the zero - block delayed csi set - up at most one block , if the source - to - relay 1 channel or the source - to - relay 2 channel does not experience an erasure on the channel block arriving after block @xmath1 .",
