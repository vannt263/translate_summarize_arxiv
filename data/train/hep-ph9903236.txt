    "in studying strong interactions exclusive processes , a more reliable method is one that bases on perturbative qcd , which calls to mind the likes of deep inelastic scattering .",
    "however unlike in these inclusive reactions where the final states of hadrons can be summed over so no explicit knowledge of any of the hadrons is required , in exclusive processes one is usually interested specifically only in a few final hadrons at a time , as such the knowledge of the wavefunctions of these hadrons is essential . the more accurate picture of a hadron is the fock state expansion where it is seen as a sum of states with increasing number of constituents starting from the state with only the valence quarks and/or antiquarks .",
    "the probability of the hadron being in any of these states is given by the modulus squared of the wavefunction associated with each of these states .",

    "g_m q_1|q_1  q_n |q_n +  because the number of constituents is unlimited , one would require , in general , far too much information before an exclusive process involving even just a few hadrons can be studied .",
    "fortunately as shown by brodsky and lepage in ref .",
    "@xcite in the so - called standard hard scattering approach ( shsa ) , when a high momentum transfer or high @xmath3 is involved in an exclusive process , not only is there factorization and so the process can be partially calculated perturbatively , but also only the lowest valence fock state wavefunctions of the hadrons are needed .",
    "the higher fock states are suppressed by the large @xmath3 .",
    "thus the large momentum transfer acts as a filter to let past only the lowest state of the hadrons .",
    "it has also been proved by duncan and mueller @xcite that these are also true in quarkonium decay with large timelike momentum transfer .",
    "most recent developments in inclusive quarkonium physics have seen , on the other hand , the need of the next higher fock state in p - wave quarkonia , the so - called colour octet , where the heavy @xmath4 pair is in a colour octet rather than the usual colour singlet as in the valence state .",
    "this higher state is made up of the @xmath4 plus a gluon .",
    "this is special to heavy quarkonium and can be understood in terms of a suppression on the level of the wavefunction due to angular momentum as we will explain in later sections .",
    "the advance in inclusive process involving quarkonia has yet to fully bring about the same level of understanding in the corresponding exclusive process .",
    "part of our goal in this paper is therefore to show that colour octet is not only important in inclusive but also in exclusive process .",
    "we will achieve this by studying the p - wave @xmath0 decay into baryon - antibaryon .    as mentioned above , knowledge of hadronic wavefunctions",
    "is very important . even in large momentum transfer processes , valence wavefunctions are still necessary . since bound state wave equations in qcd are too hard to solve , other ways to obtain the solutions or the hadronic wavefunctions must be used .",
    "one way is via qcd moment sum rules @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that perturbative calculation of the proton magnetic form factor using a range of existing nucleon distribution amplitudes so - obtained gives results that are , on the average , at least a factor of two below experimental measurements in the range of @xmath3 up to 50 gev@xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore clear that perturbative contribution is not dominant in this rather low range of @xmath3 .",
    "the same conclusion has also been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "nucleon wavefunctions constructed from such distribution amplitudes are , therefore not applicable in reactions with far from asymptotic values of @xmath3 , not to mention the fact that there might be ambiguities in the distribution amplitudes determined this way .    in order to obtain a nucleon wavefunction that is suitable for application at as low as 10 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the usually neglected but nevertheless ever present soft overlap between the final and initial nucleon wavefunction contribution to the magnetic form factor is taken to make up for the difference between the perturbative contribution and the experimental measurements .",
    "it was shown in that a nucleon model wavefunction could indeed be constructed this way , using constraints from valence quark distribution , j/@xmath5 decay width into nucleon - antinucleon pair and existing data on nucleon electromagnetic form factor . our motivation in this regard is to show that the above construction of a model nucleon wavefunction and it generalization to other octet and decuplet baryons provide a reasonable description of the baryonic valence fock state wavefunctions at around 10 gev@xmath2 . to do that we must apply these wavefunctions to exclusive processes .",
    "our investigation will allow us to study this as well as the colour octet contribution .",
    "since in @xmath0 decay into baryon - antibaryon , only nucleon - antinucleon in the final state has been measured , our calculations will show first that colour singlet contribution alone is not sufficient and by including that of the octet , the partial decay width can be brought into reasonable agreement with experiment . then with the generalization of the nucleon wavefunction to the whole flavour octet and decuplet multiplet , we can provide predictions for the widths of @xmath0 decay into other baryon pairs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we review briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec : l_supp ] the angular momentum suppression in the p - wave wavefunction and in sec .",
    "[ sec : s_o ] give theoretical argument for the inclusion of the colour octet component in exclusive decay process . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bw ] , the set of phenomenologically constructed baryon wavefunctions will be presented and explained before we use the improved modified hard scattering scheme ( mhsa ) of botts , li and sterman @xcite to obtain the singlet contribution in sec .",
    "[ sec : decay ] and [ sec : cs ] .",
    "the results will be compared to experiment . in sec .",
    "[ sec : co ] , our method in obtaining a wavefunction of the higher colour octet state of the @xmath0 and the feynman graphs of the decay process will be given .",
    "the details in constructing the octet contribution to the hard perturbative part @xmath6 will be explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : gg ] .",
    "the actual calculation and the results are in sec . [",
    "sec : s&o_shsa ] and [ sec : widths ] , respectively . in the appendices , all essential details of the calculation , the propagators and the numerators of the graphs used in sec .",
    "[ sec : s&o_shsa ] are given .",
    "in this section , we show that there is a suppression on the charmonium wavefunction due simply to the angular momentum of the heavy quark - antiquark system .",
    "this has important consequences as we will see in the next section , where we briefly review the more detailed argument given in @xcite .",
    "hadronic decay of charmonium is through the annihilation of the charm with the anticharm , which is a short distance process because of the heavy charmonium mass . the annihilation size @xmath7 is roughly given by @xmath8 , the inverse of the heavy mass @xmath9 .",
    "the charmonium wavefunction , which must enter the decay probability amplitude , is therefore needed predominantly at @xmath10 for a heavy charmonium decay . that is @xmath11 , the wavefunction at the spatial origin .",
    "this is the case for s - wave charmonium such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 . for a p - wave charmonium",
    ", the wavefunction in fact vanishes at the origin , so instead one has to expand the wavefunction around the origin .",
    "what enters the probability amplitude is actually @xmath14 .",
    "going to momentum space , the probability amplitudes for a s- and p - wave decay include the wavefunction of the form _ s ( l ) & & _ s ( k ) + _ p ( l ) ~l _p(0 ) & & _ p ( k ) , respectively , where @xmath15 is the internal momentum of the charmonium , the average value @xmath16 is of the order of a few hundreds mev .",
    "so it becomes clear that p - wave decay is suppressed by @xmath17 in comparison to s - wave at the level of the wavefunction .",
    "this suppression is one of the reasons why colour octet is necessary for a p - wave inclusive decay .",
    "we will see in the next section that it also provides the reason for its inclusion in exclusive decays .",
    "the simplest scheme to calculate charmonium partial decay width that is built on the solid basis of perturbative qcd is the hard scattering approach of brodsky and lepage @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", decay probability amplitude can be factorized into hard and soft part and is given by a convolution of hadronic distribution amplitudes @xmath18 s and the hard perturbative part @xmath6 . for the decay of @xmath0 into baryon - antibaryon , or more specifically nucleon - antinucleon ,",
    "this is ~f__j _ _",
    "j(x ) f_n _ n(x ) f_|n _ |n(x ) t_h(x ) .",
    "[ eq : shs ] since the distribution amplitudes are nothing but the hadronic wavefunctions with their internal transverse momenta being integrated over , there is still the decay constant @xmath19 accompanying each distribution amplitude . while the amplitude themselves are dimensionless , the decay constants @xmath19 s carry different mass dimensions depending on the original hadronic wavefunctions",
    "from the fact that the partial decay width is given by _ partial ~||^2 /m [ eq : width ] and there is only one mass scale @xmath9 in the process , namely the heavy charmonium mass , we can use power counting on to compare , once the mass dimensions of the decay constants are known , the colour singlet and octet contribution to the decay width and hence their relative importance to a particular hadronic decay process . for the determination of the mass dimension of @xmath19",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "examining , the decay constant of the valence fock state of nucleon @xmath20 and the colour octet charmonium decay constant @xmath21 are both 3-particle wavefunction .",
    "therefore they must be of mass dimension two .",
    "the colour singlet decay constant @xmath22 , on the other hand , is a 2-particle wavefunction so it should be of dimension one .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath0 are p - wave charmonia increases this to dimension two .",
    "the only remaining quantity in that has a dimension is @xmath6 , which contains a hidden power of @xmath9 .",
    "this power must make up the right dimension for @xmath23 , which must be dimension one in view of .",
    "so we can now collect all the dimensional quantities in the colour singlet and octet probability amplitude and determine their dependence on the large scale @xmath9 .",
    "we get ^(1 ) & ~ & m ( ) ^2 ~ + ^(8 ) & ~ & m ( ) ^2 ~ .",
    "it is now clear that both the singlet and octet contribution for the p - wave @xmath0 are weighed by the inverse fifth power of the charmonium mass .",
    "the colour octet , although a higher fock state of the charmonium , is not suppressed by the large scale of the decay process in relation to the valence singlet state .",
    "if there were no suppression at the level of the p - wave wavefunction as explained in the previous section , for example in the case of @xmath13 decay , the dependence of the singlet contribution on @xmath9 would have been @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the colour octet contribution can be neglected in the decay of a s - wave but not that of a p - wave charmonium . for more details of the argument above",
    ", one can consult @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in sec . [ sec : intro ] , most model wavefunctions constructed from qcd moment sum rules @xcite lead to rather unsatisfactory distribution amplitudes at moderate @xmath3 @xcite and they certainly do not describe experimental data .",
    "a different model wavefunction suitable for application at such low momentum transfers was constructed in .",
    "this construction is based on the following form of the nucleon wavefunction , [ pstate ] |p,+ & = [ dx ] [ d^2 ] & \\ { ^n_123|u_+^a_1 u_-^a_2 d_+^a_3 + ^n_213|u_-^a_1 u_+^a_2 d_+^a_3 + & & - ( ^n _ 132 + ^n_231)|u_+^a_1 u_+^a_2 d_-^a_3 } which is the most general of the nucleon wavefunction with zero orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
