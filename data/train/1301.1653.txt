    "in a recent preprint james owen weatherall has attempted a local and deterministic model for the epr - bohm experiment , which he affirms to have been inspired by my work on bell s theorem .",
    "although his analysis mainly concerns his attempted reconstruction of my model and why the attempt fails , his preprint has been worded in a manner that has allowed some readers to embrace his discussion as a criticism of my work on bell s theorem . here",
    "i demonstrate that ( as he himself stresses to some extent ) the analysis weatherall presents in his preprint has nothing to do with my model , or with the physics and mathematics of the epr - bohm correlation .",
    "in fact his analysis exhibits no understanding of how my local - realistic framework works , nor of the reasons why it explains the origins of all quantum correlations .",
    "i show this by first calculating the epr - bohm correlation in a successful local - deterministic model based on the spinor representation of su(2 ) , and then revealing a number of misconceptions and unwarranted assumptions in weatherall s reconstruction of my model as it relates to the bell - chsh inequalities .",
    "i conclude that , contrary to first impressions , weatherall s thinly veiled criticism of my work is entirely vacuous .",
    "in order to bring out the erroneous assumptions in weatherall s analysis , it would be convenient to assess it in the light of a successful model for the epr - bohm correlation .",
    "this will allow us to unveil his assumptions more easily .",
    "to this end , let us recall bell s definition of a _ complete _ theory .",
    "he considered a physical theory to be complete just in case its predictions for the epr - bohm experiment are dictated by local - deterministic functions of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the space of 3-vectors @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a space of the complete states @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a unit 0-sphere .",
    "he then proved a mathematical theorem concluding that no pair of functions of this form can reproduce the correlation as strong as that predicted by quantum mechanics for the rotationally invariant singlet state : @xmath8 \\,\\not=\\,-\\,{\\bf a}\\cdot{\\bf b}\\ , .",
    "\\label{corre-1 - 1}\\ ] ]    as it stands , this conclusion of bell is entirely correct and beyond dispute , provided we accept prescription ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) as codifying a complete specification of the singlet state . in his preprint , following bell and chsh , weatherall accepts ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) as codifying a complete specification of the singlet state , whereas my work begins by recognizing that ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) _ does not _ , and",
    "_ can not _ , codify a complete specification of the singlet state .",
    "i have argued that bell s prescription is based on an incorrect underpinning of both the epr argument and the actual topological configurations involved in the epr - bohm experiments , even if we leave the physics and mathematics underlying the correlation aside .",
    "my argument is rather subtle and requires a clear understanding of what is meant by both a _ function _ in mathematics and the geometry and topology of a parallelized 3-sphere .",
    "but the bottom line of the argument is that , for any two - level system , the epr criterion of completeness demands the correct measurement functions to be necessarily of the form @xmath9 with the _ simply - connected _",
    "codomain @xmath10 of @xmath11 replacing the _ totally disconnected _",
    "codomain @xmath12 assumed by bell .",
    "thus @xmath13 now represents a point of a parallelized 3-sphere , @xmath10 . as a function",
    ", it takes values from the domain @xmath14 and ends up _ belonging _ to the codomain @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , any correlation between a pair of such results is a correlation between points of a parallelized 3-sphere .",
    "unless based on a prescription of this precise form , any bell - type analysis simply does not get off the ground , because without completeness there can be no theorem .    here",
    "@xmath10which can be thought of as the configuration space of all possible rotations of a rotating body ( including spinorial sign changes)is defined as the set of all unit quaternions isomorphic to a unit parallelized 3-sphere : @xmath15}\\ ; \\bigg|\\;||\\,{\\bf q}(\\psi,\\,{\\bf r})\\,||^2=1\\right\\}\\ !",
    ", \\label{nonoonpara}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a bivector rotating about @xmath17 with the rotation angle @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 . throughout this paper",
    "i will follow the concepts , notations , and terminology of geometric algebra .",
    "accordingly , @xmath20 can be parameterized by a unit vector @xmath21 as @xmath22 with @xmath23 . here",
    "the trivector @xmath24 ( which also squares to @xmath25 ) represents a volume form of the physical space .",
    "each configuration of the rotating body can thus be represented by a quaternion of the form @xmath26 which in turn can always be decomposed as a product of two bivectors belonging to an @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath18 being its rotation angle from @xmath29 .",
    "note also that @xmath30 reduces to @xmath31 as @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "it is of paramount importance to note here that our topologically corrected prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) does not alter the actual measurement results . for a given vector @xmath4 and an initial state @xmath6 ,",
    "both operationally and mathematically we still have @xmath34 as the _ image points _ of the function @xmath11 as demanded by bell , but now the topology of its _ codomain _ has changed from a 0-sphere to a 3-sphere , with the latter embedded in @xmath35 in such a manner that the prescriptions ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) are _ operationally identical _ . on the other hand , without this topological correction it is impossible to provide a complete account of all possible measurement results in the sense specified by epr .",
    "thus the selection of the codomain @xmath36 in prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) is not a matter of choice but necessity .",
    "what is responsible for the epr correlation is _ the topology of the set of all possible measurement results_. but once the codomain of @xmath11 is so corrected , the proof of bell s theorem ( as given in refs.@xmath37 ) simply falls apart .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the strength of the correlation for _ any_@xmath37 physical system is entirely determined by the torsion within the codomain of the local functions @xmath11 .    returning to weatherall s analysis",
    ", it should be clear now that , because it is based on a prescription other than ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) , it too is a _ non - starter _ .",
    "more importantly , once we recognize that the _ only _ way of providing a complete account of all possible measurement results for the singlet state is by means of prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) , the statistical procedure for analyzing the correlation must be consistently customized for the set @xmath10 of all unit quaternions , _ which weatherall fails to do_.since this procedure can be appreciated more readily by studying the explicit construction of my model from my book and elsewhere , i now proceed to reproduce the model in some detail in the following subsections . doing so will also dispel a persistent but gravely disingenuous charge that my model encounters `` certain technical complications '' .",
    "once the measurement results are represented by functions of the form ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) , it is easy to reproduce the epr - bohm correlation in a manifestly local , realistic , and deterministic manner .",
    "this is because a parallelized 3-sphere has quite a unique and distinctive topological structure .",
    "it is one of the only two parallelizable spheres with non - vanishing torsion  the other one , with variable torsion , being the 7-sphere .",
    "once parallelized by a constant torsion , the 3-sphere remains closed under multiplication , and forms one of the only four possible normed division algebras .",
    "these are profound concepts underlying the very existence and strength of quantum correlations . by ignoring them and dismissing them as irrelevant , weatherall is ignoring the physics and mathematics of the quantum correlations .",
    "more importantly , because of the unique and distinctive topological characteristics of the 3-sphere , the measurement functions such as @xmath11 for the epr - bohm correlation have to be constructed in a very specific manner for any model to be successful . to this end , let us begin with the following definition of the orientation of a vector space :    an orientation of a finite dimensional vector space @xmath38 is an equivalence class of ordered basis , say @xmath39 , which determines the same orientation of @xmath38 as the basis @xmath40 if @xmath41 holds with @xmath42 , and the opposite orientation of @xmath38 as the basis @xmath40 if @xmath43 holds with @xmath44 .",
    "( here repeated indices are summed over . )",
    "thus each positive dimensional real vector space has precisely two possible orientations , which ( rather suggestively ) can be denoted as @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "more generally an oriented smooth manifold such as @xmath10 consists of that manifold together with a choice of orientation for each of its tangent spaces .",
    "it is important to note that orientation of a manifold is a _ relative _ concept . in particular , the orientation of a tangent space @xmath38 of a manifold defined by the equivalence class of ordered basis such as @xmath39 is meaningful only with respect to that defined by the equivalence class of ordered basis @xmath40 , and vice versa . to be sure ,",
    "we can certainly orient a manifold absolutely by choosing a set of ordered bases for all of its tangent spaces , but the resulting manifold can be said to be left or right oriented only with respect of another such set of ordered basis .",
    "now the natural configuration space for an epr - bohm type experiment is a unit parallelized 3-sphere , which can be embedded in @xmath35 with a choice of orientation , say @xmath45 or @xmath25 .",
    "this choice of orientation can be identified with the initial state of the particle pair in the singlet state with respect to the orientation of the detector basis as follows .",
    "we first characterize the embedding space @xmath35 by the graded basis @xmath47 with @xmath48 representing the two possible orientations of @xmath10 and the basis elements @xmath49 satisfying the algebra @xmath50 with an arbitrary metric @xmath51 on @xmath10 . here",
    "the bivectors @xmath52 will represent the spin angular momenta of the particles , with @xmath53 = 1 , 2 , 3 and the repeated indices summed over .",
    "these momenta can be assumed to be detected by the detector bivectors , say @xmath54 , with the corresponding detector basis @xmath55 satisfying the algebra @xmath56 and related to the spin basis @xmath57as @xmath58 evidently , the determinant of this matrix works out to be @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a @xmath62 identity matrix , this relation can be more succinctly written as @xmath63 or equivalently as @xmath64 and @xmath65 these relations reiterate the fact that orientation of any manifold is a _ relative _ concept .",
    "in particular , orientation of @xmath10 defined by the spin basis @xmath66 is meaningful only with respect to that defined by the detector basis @xmath67 with the orientation @xmath45 , and vice versa .",
    "thus the spin basis are said to define the _ same _ orientation of @xmath10 as the detector basis if @xmath68 , and the spin basis are said to define the _ opposite _ orientation of @xmath10 as the detector basis if @xmath69 . note also that the numbers @xmath70 and @xmath71 are treated here on equal footing .",
    "we are now in a position to define the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 as results of measurement interactions ( or clifford products ) between detector bivectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 and spin bivectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 as follows : @xmath78 and @xmath79 where the relative orientation @xmath6 is now assumed to be a random variable , with 50/50 chance of being @xmath80 or @xmath81 at the moment of creation of the singlet pair of spinning particles . in what follows",
    ", i will assume that the orientation of @xmath10 defined by the detector basis @xmath82 has been fixed before hand .",
    "thus the spin bivector @xmath52 is a random bivector with its handedness determined _ relative _ to the detector bivector @xmath83 , by the relation @xmath84 where , as a direct consequence of the algebra ( [ wh - o88 ] ) with @xmath85 , the bivectors @xmath76 satisfy the following identity : @xmath86 using these relations the spin detection events ( [ 88-oi ] ) and ( [ 99-oi ] ) follow at once from the algebras defined in ( [ wh - o88 ] ) and ( [ wh - o99 ] ) .",
    "evidently , the measurement results @xmath72 and @xmath73 as defined above , in addition to being manifestly realistic , are strictly local and deterministically determined numbers . in fact",
    ", they are not even contextual .",
    "alice s measurement result @xmath72although it refers to a freely chosen direction @xmath87depends only on the initial state @xmath6 ; and likewise , bob s measurement result @xmath73although it refers to a freely chosen direction @xmath88depends only on the initial state @xmath6 .",
    "let us also not overlook the fact that , as binary numbers , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are still points of a parallelized 3-sphere . to confirm this , recall that a parallelized 3-sphere is a set of unit quaternions of the form @xmath91 and a measurement result such as @xmath92 is a limiting case of such a quaternion constituting the 3-sphere : @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the volume form , limit @xmath95 is equivalent to the limit @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath96 is the rotation angle about the axis @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the angle between @xmath87 and @xmath99 .",
    "it is important to note that the variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 defined in equations ( [ 88-oi ] ) and ( [ 99-oi ] ) are generated with _",
    "different _ bivectorial scales of dispersion ( or different standard deviations ) for each measurement direction @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , in statistical terms these variables are raw scores , as opposed to standard scores . recall that a standard score , z , indicates how many standard deviations an observation or datum is above or below the mean .",
    "if @xmath100 is a raw ( or unnormalized ) score and @xmath101 is its mean value , then the standard ( or normalized ) score , @xmath102 , is defined by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the standard deviation of @xmath100 .",
    "a standard score thus represents the distance between a raw score and population mean in the units of standard deviation , and allows us to make comparisons of raw scores that come from very different sources . in other words ,",
    "the mean value of the standard score itself is always zero , with standard deviation unity . in terms of these concepts",
    "the correlation between raw scores @xmath100 and @xmath105 is defined as @xmath106}{\\sigma({\\rm x})\\;\\sigma({\\rm y } ) } \\label{co } \\\\ & = \\,\\lim_{\\,n\\,\\gg\\,1}\\left[\\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{k\\,=\\,1}^{n}\\,{\\rm z}({\\rm x}^k)\\;{\\rm z}({\\rm y}^k)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{stan}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is vital to appreciate that covariance by itself_i.e .",
    "_ , the numerator of equation ( [ co ] ) by itself  does not provide the correct measure of association between the raw scores , not the least because it depends on different units and scales ( or different scales of dispersion ) that may have been used in the measurements of such scores .",
    "therefore , to arrive at the correct measure of association between the raw scores one must either use equation ( [ co ] ) , with the product of standard deviations in the denominator , or use covariance of the standardized variables , as in equation ( [ stan ] ) .",
    "now , as discussed above , the random variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 are products of two factors  one random and another non - random . within the variable @xmath72",
    "the bivector @xmath76 is a random factor  a function of the orientation @xmath6 , whereas the bivector @xmath74 is a non - random factor , independent of the orientation @xmath107 : @xmath108 thus , as random variables , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are generated with _ different _",
    "standard deviations_i.e .",
    "_ , _ different _ sizes of the typical error . more specifically , @xmath72 is generated with the standard deviation @xmath74 , whereas @xmath73 is generated with the standard deviation @xmath75 .",
    "these two deviations can be calculated as follows . since errors in the linear relations propagate linearly , the standard deviation @xmath109 of @xmath72 is equal to @xmath74 times the standard deviation of @xmath76 [ which i will denote as @xmath110 , whereas the standard deviation @xmath111 of @xmath73 is equal to @xmath75 times the standard deviation of @xmath77 [ which i will denote as @xmath112 : @xmath113 but since the bivector @xmath76 is normalized to unity , and since its mean value @xmath114 vanishes on the account of @xmath6 being a fair coin , its standard deviation is easy to calculate , and it turns out to be equal to unity : @xmath115 where the last equality follows from the normalization of @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , it is easy to see that @xmath116 is also equal to @xmath70",
    ". consequently , the standard deviation of @xmath89 works out to be @xmath74 , and the standard deviation of @xmath90 works out to be @xmath75 . putting these two results together , we arrive at the following standard scores corresponding to the raw scores @xmath117 and @xmath118 : @xmath119 and @xmath120 where i have used identities such as @xmath121 .",
    "needless to say , these standard scores are pure bivectors : @xmath122      as noted towards the end of subsection ii@xmath37a , one of several oversights in weatherall s reading of my model concerns his failure to recognize the necessity of applying the correct statistical procedure for analyzing the correlation between the measurement results defined by ( [ 88-oi ] ) and ( [ 99-oi ] ) .",
    "this is surprising , because i pointed out this oversight to him in a private correspondence more than eighteen months ago . as we noted above",
    ", a parallelized 3-sphere is a set of unit quaternions .",
    "each point of a parallelized 3-sphere is thus represented by a unit quaternion . as a result",
    ", the correct statistical procedure within my model must take into account how errors propagate in a 3-sphere of unit quaternions .",

    "thus , for a given value of @xmath6 , both @xmath135 and @xmath138 represent the same sense of rotation about @xmath4 ( either both represent clockwise rotations or both represent counterclockwise rotations ) .",
    "this is crucial for the calculation of standard deviation , for it is supposed to give the average rotational distance within @xmath10 from its mean , with the average being taken , not over rotational distances within a fixed orientation of @xmath10 , but over the changes in the orientation @xmath6 of @xmath10 itself .",
    "note also that , according to the definition ( [ quat-0 ] ) , @xmath135 and its conjugate @xmath139 satisfy the following relation : @xmath140 consequently , the standard deviation of both @xmath138 and @xmath141 must , with certainty , give the same number : @xmath142\\,\\equiv\\,\\sigma[\\,-\\,{\\bf q}(\\psi)]\\,.\\ ] ] it is easy to verify that definition ( [ standipo ] ) for the standard deviation of @xmath135 does indeed satisfy this requirement , at least when @xmath143 .",
    "what is more , from equation ( [ relat ] ) we note that the quantity being averaged in the definition ( [ standipo ] ) is essentially @xmath144 .",
    "this quantity is insensitive to spinorial sign changes such as @xmath145 , but transforms into the quantity @xmath146 under orientation changes such as @xmath147 .",

    "now , in order to evaluate @xmath151 and @xmath152 , we can rewrite the quaternion ( [ quat-0 ] ) rotating about @xmath153 as a product @xmath154 of a non - random , non - pure quaternion @xmath155 and a random , unit bivector @xmath76 satisfying @xmath156 note that @xmath157 reduces to the unit bivector @xmath158 for rotation angles @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",

    "is thus also a bivector : @xmath238 .    as straightforward",
    "as it is , the above conclusion may seem unusual .",

    "etc_.    this completes the presentation of my local , realistic , and deterministic model for the epr - bohm correlation .",
    "with the successful model firmly in place , we are now in a position to understand why weatherall s model fails . to begin with ,",
    "his model is based on a different representation of the rotation group .",
    "it is in fact based , not on the spinorial rotation group su(2 ) , but something akin to its tensorial cousin so(3 ) , which is a group of all proper rotations in @xmath3 , _ insensitive _ to spinorial sign changes .",
    "in fact , weatherall takes a rather odd space , namely @xmath313 , for the codomain of his measurement functions @xmath11 , and then introduces another projection map to arrive at the measurement results @xmath314 .",
    "compared to my measurement functions ( [ 88-oi ] ) obtained through a smooth limiting process ( [ amanda ] ) , his two - step measurement process is rather artificial .",
    "since his is not a simply - connected , parallelized codomain such as @xmath10 that remains closed under multiplication , it can not possibly satisfy the completeness criterion of epr .",
    "it is therefore not surprising why weatherall is unable to find strong correlation among its points .",
    "moreover , at the end of his two - step process his measurement results @xmath314 are no longer the image points within the codomain @xmath313 of his measurement functions .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the situation in my model , where my measurement results @xmath314 remain very much a part of the codomain @xmath10 of my measurement functions .",
    "the reason why this comes about naturally within my model is because @xmath10 , the set of unit quaternions , is a simply - connected surface embedded in @xmath35 that is equipped with a _ graded _",
    "basis made of both scalars and bivectors : @xmath315 thus the scalars @xmath314 are as much a part of @xmath10 as the bivectors @xmath316 are , regulated by these unified basis .",
    "i am tempted to quip : _ what nature has joined together , let no man put asunder_. by contrast weatherall s codomain is disconnected between the space @xmath313 of `` bivectors '' and the set @xmath314 of scalars .",
    "his image points can thus be at best either bivectors or scalars , but not both .",
    "it is a disjoint world , more like the world of quantum mechanics .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ fig-55 ]    ' '' ''    let us , however , be more charitable to weatherall .",
    "let us grant him the codomain of his measurement functions to be the connected real projective space @xmath317 , which is homeomorphic to the rotation group so(3 ) .",
    "after all , he does mention the lie algebra @xmath318 in one of his footnotes .",
    "so let us grant him the smooth one - step measurement process @xmath319 to reach the image subset @xmath314 .",
    "this smooth map is well - defined within my model , since @xmath317 is simply the set @xmath10 of unit quaternions ( cf .",
    "eq.@xmath37([nonoonpara ] ) ) with each point identified with its antipodal point .",
    "the measurement results @xmath320 are thus limiting points of a quaternion , just as in equation ( [ amanda ] ) . the map that takes us from @xmath10 to @xmath317",
    "can now be used to project the metric @xmath270 on @xmath10 onto @xmath317 to obtain the following induced metric on @xmath317 : @xmath321 further details of how this metric is obtained from the metric on @xmath10 can be found in section iii of ref.@xmath37 .",
    "the two metrics @xmath270 and @xmath322 thus provide relative measures of geodesic distances on the manifolds @xmath10 and @xmath317 , respectively . substituting the metric on @xmath317 into equation ( [ corwedid ] ) the correlation between the points of so(3 )",
    "then works out to be @xmath323 the two sets of correlations , ( [ robisanan ] ) and ( [ equawhichr-2 ] ) , are compared in fig.@xmath37[fig-55 ] .",
    "the general correlation function @xmath279 derived in equation ( [ corwedid ] ) can thus serve to distinguish the geodesic distances @xmath324 on the groups su(2 ) and so(3 ) .",
    "it is crucial to appreciate that even when we choose so(3 ) as the codomain of the function @xmath11 the correct statistical procedure that must be followed is the one described in subsections ii@xmath37c and ii@xmath37d above .",
    "this is because , as weatherall himself notes , the lie algebras of su(2 ) and so(3 ) are isomorphic to each other . in other words , the local algebraic or tangent space structures on su(2 ) and so(3 ) are identical , but not their metrical structures in the sense of geodesic distances .",
    "thus the above statistical procedure , tailored to the graded basis ( [ graded ] ) , leading up to the general expression ( [ darcor ] ) for correlations and beyond , is equally inevitable in the case of so(3 ) . comparing the two sets of correlations resulting from this procedure ",
    "one for the prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) and other for the prescription ( [ map-1 - 3])it is then easy to see why we have lost the strong correlation in the second case .",
    "we started out with @xmath10 as a codomain of @xmath11 and then , for the case of so(3 ) , we identified each point of @xmath10 with its antipodal point .",
    "but in doing so we lost the following spinorial rotation symmetry satisfied by @xmath30 , as described in equations ( [ clacct ] ) and ( [ non - clacct ] ) above : @xmath325 in other words , by identifying the antipodal points of @xmath10 we lost the sensitivity to spinorial sign changes . as a result , @xmath30 now represents the state of a rotating body that returns to itself after any and all multiples of @xmath137 rotation : @xmath326 this is the real reason why we lost the strong correlation for the so(3 ) case .",
    "the reason weatherall has argued for is an artifact of his bad choice of measurement functions .",
    "it stems from a failure to appreciate the unified nature of the graded basis ( [ graded ] ) and the associated fact that the scalars @xmath314 and the bivectors @xmath316 occur as image points within the same codomain @xmath10 in my model .",
    "thus the loss of correlation has nothing to do with the fact that ultimately the measurement functions must map to the image subset @xmath314 .",

    "when , at the end of their experiment , they evaluate the statistical quantity @xmath287 involving these numbers as @xmath285,\\ ] ] they will inevitably find that it exceeds the bound of 2 and extends to the bound of @xmath277 .",
    "this conclusion may seem odd from the perspective of bell - type reasoning , but the evidence presented for it in subsection ii@xmath37f is incontrovertible .",
    "in addition to the main issue discussed above , it is instructive to reflect on the broader reasons why weatherall s model fails .",
    "we can in fact identify at least six erroneous steps which engender the failure of his model from the start :    1 .",
    "choice of incomplete codomain of the measurement functions @xmath11 ( although with correct image points @xmath31 ) .",
    "2 .   neglect of putting scalars and bivectors on equal footing within a single , comprehensive , real number system .",
    "3 .   failure to implement a spinor representation of su(2 ) by recognizing the significance of spinorial sign changes .",
    "4 .   lack of appreciation of the role played by the parallelizing torsion within @xmath10 for the existence and strength of strong correlations ( or not recognizing the discipline of parallelization as the true source of strong correlations ) .",
    "failure to appreciate how errors propagate within @xmath10 , when taken as a codomain of the measurement functions",
    "neglect of the correct statistical procedure in the derivations of both the correlation and the upper bound @xmath277 .",
    "although interconnected , any one of these reasons is sufficient for the failure of weatherall s model . recognizing this ,",
    "i must conclude that , contrary to first impressions , weatherall s thinly veiled criticism of my work is entirely vacuous .",
    "i am grateful to lucien hardy for several months of correspondence which led to improvements in section ii@xmath37d .",
    "i am also grateful to martin castell for his hospitality in the materials department of the university of oxford .",

    "consequently , the die @xmath380 has exactly 50/50 chance of landing on its faces @xmath80 or @xmath25 in general .",
    "thus , the measurement outcomes @xmath358 or @xmath25 observed by alice ( regardless of bob ) is a result of a throw of the die @xmath380 , which has 50/50 chance of landing on its face marked @xmath80 or @xmath25 , depending on the values of @xmath348 .",
    "one can confirm these odds for @xmath380 in a computer simulation , as in fig.@xmath37[fig-57 ] .",
    "the question now is : how do the actual values @xmath117 and @xmath118 of the functions @xmath343 and @xmath344 come about within the 3-sphere when they are observed _ simultaneously _ by alice and bob ? to answer this question , recall",
    "that 3-sphere remains closed under multiplication , with its points represented by quaternions of the form ( [ defi-2 ] ) , and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are limiting values of such quaternions .",

    "let me stress again that , since @xmath10 remains closed under multiplication , a limit like this one is the only legitimate way of determining the correct values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath384 , since all three of them are constrained to be what they possibly could be by the very geometry and topology of the 3-sphere . in other words , by taking the orientation @xmath6 of @xmath10 as the initial state of the spin system , we have in fact taken the entire geometry and topology of @xmath130 as the _ common cause _ that determines the actual values @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which are thus dictated to be what they turn out to be by the product @xmath384 resulting in the limit ( [ ntt-2 ] ) . hence our goal is to find the correct product quaternion whose limit is the value @xmath385 or @xmath25 .    to this end , let us work out the product appearing on the rhs of the above limit equation explicitly , which gives @xmath386 although it may not be obvious at first sight , this product is necessarily a unit quaternion of the form ( [ defi-2 ] ) : @xmath387 in other words , the product ( [ mni - identity ] ) is a sum of a scalar part and a bivector part , and when its scalar part , @xmath388 , reduces to @xmath389 , its bivector part reduces to zero , because the coefficient , @xmath390 , of the bivector @xmath391 reduces to zero . in view of ( [ ntt-2 ] ) , ( [ mni - identity ] ) , and ( [ defi-3 ] )",
    "it is thus clear that the limits @xmath392 or @xmath25 are equivalent to the limits @xmath393 but since @xmath333 is a uniformly distributed _ random _ unit vector in @xmath3 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath394 is also a _ random _",
    "variable , taking values from the interval @xmath354}$ ] : @xmath395 thus , just as @xmath380 in eq.@xmath37([notpr ] ) , @xmath394 is a die with certain propensities for landing on its faces @xmath80 or @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , for a sufficiently large number of random vectors @xmath333 , the random variable @xmath394 has 47% chance of landing on its face marked @xmath25 for @xmath396 , and 47% chance of landing on its face marked @xmath80 for @xmath397 .",
    "what is more , from the lhs of the conditions ( [ c-1 ] ) and ( [ c-2 ] ) , using the limits @xmath398 and @xmath399 , it is easy to verify that @xmath400 where the second result is due to the spinorial sign change that the quaternion @xmath401 undergoes with respect to the quaternion @xmath402 upon rotation by angle @xmath403 .",
    "[ @xmath37it is worth noting here that weatherall s model is incapable of exhibiting such a change from @xmath404 to @xmath385 in the product of the observed numbers @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "his model has been deliberately manufactured to fail this first test , in anticipation of his intended goal . ]",
    "the above results are of course two very special cases .",
    "they are the cases when the measurement axes chosen by alice and bob happen to be aligned or anti - aligned with each other . in more general cases ,",
    "when the measurement axes of alice and bob happen to subtend angles different from @xmath405 or @xmath172 , it takes a bit more effort to deduce what values the results @xmath117 and @xmath118 and their product @xmath384 within @xmath10 would turn out to have .",
    "in fact , because @xmath394 is a random variable , in more general cases statistical considerations are inevitable .",
    "the question we must ask in the general cases is the following : given the random variable @xmath394 taking values in the interval @xmath354}$ ] , what are the chances  as functions of the angle @xmath329 between @xmath87 and @xmath88for the occurrences of the events @xmath385 and @xmath404 ?",
    "the answer to this question can be obtained by computing the following set of conditional probabilities : @xmath406 where the random variable @xmath394which ( as we saw above ) can be thought of as a loaded die  is now given by @xmath407 in the form of eq.@xmath37([defi-3 ] ) , this is the scalar part of the product of the following two manifestly local quaternions : @xmath408 where @xmath409 and @xmath410 are the normalizing factors . needless to say , @xmath411 specified in eq.@xmath37([c-23-want ] ) is the same as that specified in eqs.@xmath37([c-1 ] ) and ( [ c-2 ] ) apart from the phase shifts @xmath412 , @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and @xmath415 .",
    "these phase shifts contribute to the rotations of the product quaternion about the random vector @xmath416 [ which is different in general from the vectors @xmath417 and @xmath418 .",
    "they are simply numerical constants , independent of the parameter vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 , or of the random vector @xmath333 .",
    "they are thus parts of the geometry of the 3-sphere .",
    "together with @xmath333 , they form what bell referred to as the `` past causes . ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    in terms of the product of the quaternions ( [ quat - aaa ] ) and ( [ quat - bbb ] ) , we are now in a position to express the measurement results @xmath343 and @xmath344 , and their product @xmath381 , in the following manifestly local - realistic forms : @xmath419 here the vector @xmath416 depends on both @xmath417 and @xmath420 , as well as on the other past causes .",
    "although we do not require its explicit expression , it can be easily worked out by evaluating the geometric product of the quaternions @xmath421 and @xmath422 .",
    "the 3-sphere analogue of bell s factorizability condition then appears as @xmath423 which , in the measurement limits ( [ eieipo ] ) and ( [ eieilo ] ) , reduces to the factorization of the corresponding scalar values : @xmath424 needless to say that the constraints ( [ nimpo-1 ] ) and ( [ nimpo-2 ] ) , which are manifestations of the geometry and topology of the 3-sphere , put strong restrictions on the possible values of the phase shifts @xmath412 , @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and @xmath415 . one possible set of their values in degrees is @xmath425 . with these values ,",
    "the scalar parts of @xmath343 and @xmath344 are given by @xmath426 and @xmath427,respectively , whereas the scalar part @xmath411 of @xmath381 is the one stated in equation ( [ c-23-want ] ) .

    "thus , for example , the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the results @xmath359 and @xmath432 is given by the probability of the die @xmath411 landing on its face marked @xmath25 .",
    "the results of numerical computations of such probabilities are illustrated in fig.@xmath37[fig-57 ] .",
    "they turn out to be as follows : @xmath433 as described in eq.@xmath37([corappenir ] ) , the correlation predicted by our local model can now be readily calculated as follows : @xmath434 this correlation can also be computed directly in the simulation described in fig.@xmath37[fig-57 ] .",
    "the result is depicted in fig.@xmath37[fig-59 ] .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    let me stress that the above correlation is produced entirely within a strictly local and deterministic model of the physical reality . as we have already noted several times , the measurement results @xmath343 and @xmath344 defined in ( [ eieipo ] ) and ( [ eieilo ] ) are manifestly local . moreover , the product quaternions @xmath435 , and hence their scalar limits @xmath436 , are intrinsically factorizable , as shown in equations ( [ nimpo-1 ] ) and ( [ nimpo-2 ] ) . @xmath343 and @xmath344 are thus determined by a common cause ",
    "namely , the geometry and topology of the 3-sphere  and the local vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in practical terms , this common cause is translated into the set @xmath437 . the actual measurement results @xmath117 and @xmath118 observed by alice and bob are thus only dependent on these common causes and the local vectors .    for completeness ,",
    "let me also note that the above correlation gives rise to the following string of expectation values : @xmath438 it is well known that the right - hand - side of the above equation violates the celebrated bell - chsh inequality .",
    "it is worth noting here that the local - realistic model described above violates not only the bell - chsh inequality , but also the clauser - horne inequality : @xmath439 to appreciate this , recall the following predictions of our local model : @xmath440 these predictions are the same as the ones stated in eqs.@xmath37([lesson-1 ] ) to ( [ lesson])which , in turn , are the same as those predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "consequently , clauser - horne inequality is inevitably violated by our local model .",
    "it is also worth recalling here that once the topology of the codomain of the measurement functions is correctly specified , not only the epr - bohm correlation , but also the correlations predicted by the rotationally non - invariant quantum states such as the ghz states and the hardy state  and in fact those predicted by _ all _ quantum states  can be reproduced exactly in a purely classical , local - realistic manner .",
    "thus , contrary to the widespread belief , the correlations exhibited by such states are not irreducible quantum effects , but purely local - realistic , topological effects .",
    "needless to say , this vindicates einstein s suspicion that quantum state merely describes statistical ensemble of physical systems , and not the individual physical system .",
    "it is this inevitable conclusion that weatherall is resisting .",
    "the above results once again confirm the fact that epr - bohm correlations are local - realistic correlations among the points of a parallelized 3-sphere . as we saw in section ii , however , this fact can be expressed more elegantly by understanding how random errors propagate within a parallelized 3-sphere . in particular",
    ", we saw that epr - bohm correlations can be derived by recognizing that the raw scores @xmath72 and @xmath73 are generated within @xmath10 with _ different _ bivectorial scales of dispersion , and hence the correct correlation between them can be determined only by calculating the covariation of the corresponding standardized variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath441 \\,=\\lim_{\\,n\\,\\gg\\,1}\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\,=\\,1}^{n}\\ , { \\bf l}({\\bf a},\\,\\lambda^i){\\bf l}({\\bf b},\\,\\lambda^i)\\right]\\,=\\,-\\,{\\bf a}\\cdot{\\bf b}\\ , , \\label{afort}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath442 and the standardized variables are defined as @xmath443}\\,= \\frac{\\,{\\mathscr a}({\\bf a},\\,\\lambda)\\,-\\,m({\\mathscr a})}{\\sigma[\\,{\\mathscr a}({\\bf a},\\,\\lambda)]}\\,.\\ ] ] note that this definition holds for any point @xmath166 of @xmath10 , and not just for the limiting point @xmath444 @xmath445 obtained in equation ( [ amanda ] ) . the epr - bohm correlations @xmath446 are thus correlations between any two points @xmath166 and @xmath447 of @xmath10 , with the scalar points @xmath92 and @xmath448 being only a special case .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the correlation between the raw scores @xmath72 and @xmath73 is determined in eq.@xmath37([afort ] ) by calculating their covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations @xmath449}$ ] and @xmath450}$ ] : @xmath451\\;\\sigma[\\,{\\mathscr b}({\\bf b},\\,\\lambda)\\,]\\,=\\ , -\\,{\\bf d}({\\bf a}){\\bf d}({\\bf b})\\,=\\,(-i\\cdot{\\bf a})(+i\\cdot{\\bf b } ) \\,=\\,{\\bf a}{\\bf b}\\,=\\,{\\bf a}\\cdot{\\bf b}\\,+\\,{\\bf a}\\wedge{\\bf b}\\,.\\ ] ] this product , however , is precisely the rotor that quantifies the twist in the fibration of the 3-sphere .",
    "its value varies from @xmath80 for @xmath452 to @xmath25 for @xmath453 and back , producing the correct combination of observed probabilities .",
    "it should be evident from the above results that there is a valuable lesson to be learned from weatherall s analysis : an explicit , constructive , quantitatively precise physical model x can not be undermined by repudiating its distorted misrepresentation y , even by appealing to a formal theorem ( especially when that theorem is grounded on unphysical assumptions ) .",
    "such a strategy only serves to exemplify an elementary logical fallacy  namely , the straw - man fallacy .",
    "inspired by the simulation of the 3-sphere model by chantal roth discussed in the previous appendix , michel fodje has produced another explicit , event - by - event simulation of the model that is worth elaborating on here .",
    "while the simulation by chantal roth is primarily based on the joint probability density function @xmath454 defined in ( [ c-23-want ] ) , the simulation by michel fodje is based on the individual probability density functions @xmath455 and @xmath456 . from footnote 1 above we see that the individual probability density functions @xmath457 satisfy the relation @xmath458 with respect to any fixed vector @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests that the constraints @xmath459 for arbitrary angles @xmath460 and @xmath461 should play a crucial role in dictating the integrity and strength of the correlation between the results @xmath462 and @xmath463 , for any given angle @xmath464}$ ] . according to these constraints the probability densities @xmath465 and @xmath466 for observing the measurement results @xmath462 and @xmath463 depend on the common parameter @xmath467 , just as they depend on the common random vector @xmath333 . this in turn suggests that we may treat @xmath467 as an additional random parameter , and take the set @xmath468 as the complete or initial state of our physical system . given this complete state , the outcomes of measurements are deterministically determined by the topological constraints within the 3-sphere . from a geometrical point of view , the parameter @xmath467 links two disconnected `` sections '' of @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ , two `` orthogonal '' 2-spheres within @xmath10 ) defined by the bivectors @xmath469 and @xmath470 , by means of the constraints ( [ con - michel ] ) [ see fig.@xmath37[fig-588778 ] for the relationship between these two 2-spheres ] .          with these considerations ,",
