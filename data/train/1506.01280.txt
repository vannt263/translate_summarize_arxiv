    "more often than not the agents of a social system prefer to combine their efforts in order to achieve results that would be otherwise unattainable by a single agent alone .",
    "a relevant role in the organisation of such systems is therefore played by the emerging patterns of collaboration within a group of individuals , which have been widely and thoroughly investigated in the last few decades  @xcite . in a collaboration network ,",
    "two individuals are considered to be linked if they are bound by some form of partnership .",
    "for instance , in the case of scientific collaborations , the nodes of the networks correspond to scientists and the relationship between two authors is testified by the fact that they have co - authored one or more papers  @xcite .",
    "another well - known example of collaboration network is that of co - starring graphs , where the nodes represent actors and there is a link between two actors if they have appeared in the same movie .",
    "the study of large collaboration systems has revealed the presence of a surprisingly high number of triangles in the corresponding networks  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that two nodes with a common neighbour have a higher probability to be linked than two randomly chosen nodes .",
    "this effect , known as _ transitivity _",
    "@xcite , can be easily explained in terms of a basic mechanism commonly referred to as _",
    "triadic closure _",
    "@xcite , according to which two individuals of a collaboration network have a high probability to connect after having been introduced to each other by a mutual acquaintance  @xcite .",
    "some other works have pointed out that triadic closure can also explain other empirical features of real - world collaboration networks , including fat - tailed degree distributions and correlations between the degrees of neighbouring nodes  @xcite .",
    "another remarkable feature often observed in social and collaboration networks is the presence of meso - scale structures in the form of _ communities _ , i.e. groups of tightly connected nodes which are loosely linked to each other  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , structural communities quite often correspond to functional groups  @xcite .",
    "an important observation is that not all the links of a collaboration network are equal , since collaborations can often be classified into a number of different categories .",
    "for instance , scientific co - authorship can be classified according to the research field , while actors often appear in movies of different genres . in these cases , a collaboration network is better described in terms of a _ multi - layer _ or _",
    "multiplex network _",
    "@xcite where links representing collaborations of a specific kind are embedded on a separate layer of the network , and each layer can have in general a different topology .",
    "great attention has been recently devoted to the characterisation of the structure  @xcite and dynamics  @xcite of multi - layer networks .",
    "in particular , various models to grow multiplex networks have appeared in the literature , focusing on linear  @xcite or non - linear  @xcite preferential attachment , or on weighted networks  @xcite .",
    "less attention has been devoted to define and extract communities in multiplex networks  @xcite , for instance by mean of stochastic block models  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the multiplex nature of communities in collaboration networks and we propose a simple model to explain the appearance , coexistence and co - evolution of communities at the different layers of a multiplex .",
    "our hypothesis is that the formation of communities in collaboration networks is an intrinsically multiplex process , which is the result of the interplay between intra - layer and inter - layer triadic closure .",
    "for instance , in the case of scientific collaborations , multiplex communities naturally arise from the fact that scientists may collaborate with other researchers in their principal field of investigation and with colleagues coming from other scientific disciplines .",
    "analogously , actors can prefer either to specialise in a specific genre or instead to explore different ( sometimes dissonant ) genres , and these two opposite behaviours undoubtedly have an impact on the kind of meso - scale structures observed on each of the layers of of the system .",
    "the generative model we propose here mimics two of the most basic processes that drive the evolution of collaborations in the real world , namely intra- and inter - layer triadic closure , and is able to explain the appearance of overlapping modular organisations in multi - layer systems .",
    "we will show that the model is able to reproduce the salient micro- , meso- and macro - scale structure of different real - world collaboration networks , including the multi - layer network of co - authorship in journals of the american physical society ( aps ) and the multiplex co - starring graph obtained from the internet movie database ( imdb ) .",
    "we start by analysing the structure of two multiplex collaboration networks from the real world .",
    "the first multiplex is constructed from the aps co - authorship data set , and consists of four layers representing four sub - fields of physics ( respectively , nuclear physics , particle physics , condensed matter i , and interdisciplinary physics ) . in particular , we considered only scientists with at least one publication in each of the four sub - fields , and we connected two scientists at a certain layer if they had co - authored at least a paper in the corresponding sub - field .",
    "the second multiplex is constructed from the internet movie database ( imdb ) and consist of four layers respectively representing the co - starring networks of actors with at least one participation in four different genres , namely action , crime , romance , and thriller movies .",
    "the basic structural properties of each layer of the two multiplexes are summarised in table  [ tab : exapsimdbsingle ] ( see methods for more information about the data sets ) .",
    ".[tab : exapsimdbsingle]*basic properties of real - world multiplex collaboration networks . *",
    "we report the number of nodes @xmath0 , the average degree @xmath1 and the clustering coefficient @xmath2 for each layer of a subset of the aps and imdb data sets . in particular , we focus on the multiplex collaboration network of all scientists active in nuclear , particle , condensed matter i and interdisciplinary physics , and the multiplex collaboration network of all actors starring in action , crime , romance and thriller movies",
    ". all the layers of aps have a clustering coefficient @xmath2 in the range @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "conversely , the values of @xmath2 of all the imdb layers are in the range @xmath4 $ ] . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "human collaboration patterns are inherently multifaceted and often consist of different interaction layers .",
    "scientific collaboration is probably the most emblematic example . as a ph.d .",
    "student you usually join the scientific collaboration network by publishing the first paper with your supervisor in a specific field .",
    "afterwards , you start being introduced by your supervisor to other researchers in the same field , e.g. to some of his / her past collaborators , and you might end up working with them , creating new triangles in the collaboration network of your field ( what we called intra - layer triadic closure ) .",
    "but it is also quite probable that some of your past collaborators will in turn introduce you to researchers working in another -possibly related- area ( what we called an inter - layer triadic closure ) , so that you will easily find yourself participating in more than just one field , and the collaboration network around you will become multi - dimensional .",
    "such multi - level collaboration patterns appear not to be specific of scientific production only , but are instead found in many aspects of human activity .",
    "the multi - layer network framework provides a natural way of modelling and characterising multidimensional collaboration patterns in a comprehensive manner .",
    "in particular , we have argued that one of the classical mechanisms responsible for the creation of triangles of acquaintances , i.e. triadic closure , is indeed general enough to give also account for another interesting aspect of multi - level collaboration networks , namely the formation of cohesive communities spanning more than a single layer of interaction .",
    "it is quite intriguing that the simple model we proposed in this work , based just on the interplay between intra- and inter - layer triadic closure , is actually able to explain much of the complexity observed in the micro- meso- and macroscopic structure of multidimensional collaboration networks of different fields ( science and movies ) , including not just transitivity but also intra- and inter - layer degree correlation patterns and the correspondence between the community partitions at difference layers .",
    "we also remark that such levels of accuracy in reproducing the features of real - world systems have been obtained without the introduction of ad - hoc ingredients .",
    "the results reported in this paper suggest that , despite the apparent differences in the overall dynamics driving scientific cooperation and movie co - starring , triadic closure is a quite generic mechanism and might indeed be one of the fundamental processes shaping the structure of multi - layer collaboration systems .",
    "these findings fill a gap in the literature about modelling growing multidimensional networks , and pave the way to the exploration of other simple models which can help underpinning the driving mechanisms responsible for the emergence of complex multi - dimensional structures .",
    "_ data sets .  _ we considered data from the aps and the imdb collaboration networks .",
    "the aps collaboration data set is available from the aps website ` http://journals.aps.org/datasets ` in the form of xml files containing detailed information about all the papers published by all aps journals .",
    "the download is free of charge and restricted to research purposes , and aps does not grant to the recipients the permission to redistribute the data to third parties .",
    "we parsed the original xml files to retrieve , for each paper , the list of authors and the list of pacs codes .",
    "the pacs scheme provides a taxonomy of subjects in physics , and is widely used by several journals to identify the sub - field , category and subject of papers .",
    "we used the highest level of pacs codes to identify the ten main sub - fields of physics , and we considered only the papers published in nuclear physics , particle physics , condensed matter i and interdisciplinary physics , respectively associated to high - level pacs codes starting with 1 ( particle physics ) , 2 ( nuclear physics ) , 6 ( condensed matter i ) and 8 ( interdisciplinary physics ) .",
    "we focused only on the authors who had at least one publication in each of the four sub - fields  @xcite .",
    "the co - authorship network of each of those four sub - fields constitutes one of the four layers of the aps multiplex .",
    "in particular , two authors are connected on a certain layer only if they have co - authored at least one paper in the corresponding sub - field . in the construction of the collaboration network of each sub - field",
    "we purposely left out papers with more than ten authors , which represent big collaborations whose driving dynamics might be more complex than just triadic closure .",
    "the imdb data set is made available at the website ` ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/ ` for personal use and research purposes .",
    "the data set comes in the form of several compressed text files , and we used those containing information about actors , actresses , movies and genres .",
    "we focused only on the co - starring networks of four movie genres , namely action , crime , romance , and thriller  @xcite , obtained by merging information about participation of actors and actresses to each movie .",
    "in particular , two actors are connected by a link on a given layer ( genre ) only if they have co - starred in at least one movie of that genre .",
    "we considered only the actors who had acted in at least one movie of each of the four genres .",
    "we chose to restrict our analysis to just four layers for both the aps and the imdb data set , which allowed us to consider the simplest formulation of our model , in which all the layers have the same clustering coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "the use of the aps and the imdb data sets does not require any ethical approval .",
    "_ transitivity and community structure .",
    " _ we measured the transitivity of each level by mean of the clustering coefficient @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 : @xmath7    the similarity of two community partitions can be measured through the normalised mutual information ( nmi )  @xcite . in particular , given the two partitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively associated to layer @xmath10 and layer @xmath11 , we denote the normalised mutual information ( nmi ) between them as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of nodes in common between module @xmath14 of partition @xmath8 and module @xmath15 of partition @xmath16 , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the number nodes in module @xmath14 and in module @xmath15 .",
    "the partition in communities on each layer has been obtained through the algorithm infomap  @xcite .",
    "_ synthetic multiplex networks .",
    " _ we created synthetic networks according to our multi - layer network model by starting , on each layer , from a seed graph consisting of a triangle of nodes and simulating the intra- and inter - layer triadic closure mechanism for @xmath19 nodes , for different values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for each pair of values",
    "@xmath22 we computed the mean clustering coefficient @xmath2 on each single layer and the normalised mutual information nmi of the community partitions of the two layers over 30 different realisations .",
    "as observed from simulations , once the parameters @xmath23 are fixed , the values of nmi and @xmath2 do not vary substantially as the order @xmath0 of the network increases .",
    "notice that since the most simple formulation of the model we have set an identical value of @xmath20 on both layers , the two layers will end up having the same clustering coefficient ( up to small finite - size fluctuation ) .",
    "_ degree correlations . ",
    "_ we study the assortativity of real multiplex collaboration networks in terms of intra - layer , inter - layer and mixed degree correlations .",
    "the trend for intra - layer correlations is analysed by mean of the function @xmath24}_{nn}(k^{[\\alpha ] } ) \\rangle$ ] , that is the average degree of the nearest neighbours on layer @xmath10 of a node with given degree @xmath25}}$ ] on that layer . in particular , @xmath24}_{nn } \\rangle$ ] is obtained as an average of @xmath26}_{nn , i}$ ] over all nodes with the same degree @xmath27}$ ] .",

    "it is interesting to notice that , in absence of intra - layer degree correlations , @xmath24}_{nn}(k^{[\\alpha ] } ) \\rangle$ ] is a constant , while @xmath24}_{nn}(k^{[\\alpha ] } ) \\rangle$ ] is an increasing ( resp . , decreasing )",

    "again , @xmath29}(k^{[\\alpha ] } ) \\rangle$ ] will be an increasing function of @xmath25}}$ ] if nodes tend to have similar degrees on both layers ( assortative inter - layer correlations ) , while @xmath30}(k^{[\\alpha ] } ) \\rangle$ ] will decrease with @xmath25}}$ ] if a hub on one layer will preferentially have small degree on the other layer , and vice - versa .    finally , we measured the presence of mixed correlations through the function @xmath31}_{nn}(k^{[\\alpha ] } ) \\rangle$ ] , that is the average degree on layer @xmath11 of the nearest neighbours on layer @xmath11 of a node with degree @xmath27}$ ] on layer @xmath10  @xcite . in analogy with the case of intra - layer correlations , the node term is @xmath32}_{nn , i}=\\frac{\\sum_{j \\neq i }    a^{[\\beta]}_{ij}k_j^{[\\beta]}}{k_i^{[\\alpha]}}$ ] .",
    "we remark here that there exists another possible definition of mixed correlations coefficient , which considers the nearest neighbours of a node on layer @xmath10 rather then @xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the results for the alternative definition of mixed correlations are analogous to those observed for @xmath33}_{nn}(k^{[\\alpha ] } ) \\rangle$ ] and are not shown in the text .",
