    "the optical propagation in kerr media with a transverse and spectral gain profile is of much interest in many areas .",
    "for instance , a combination of gain guiding and nonlinear self - focusing can play an important role for the spatial propagation of a laser beam in high - power laser rods . in nonlinear dispersive gain fibers , e.g. , in fiber lasers or optical transmission lines equipped with erbium - doped fiber amplifiers ,",
    "the temporal pulse evolution is affected by self - phase modulation and spectral filtering.@xcite the coupled spatiotemporal dynamics in the gain medium is relevant for the operation of kerr - lens mode - locked ( klm )  lasers , where the pulse stabilization is governed by a combination of spatial and temporal effects.@xcite    the variational approach has been extensively used for an approximate description of the optical propagation in nonlinear media . by describing the optical field in terms of a trial function with free parameters , a set of coupled ordinary differential equations can be extracted from the partial differential equation governing the optical propagation .",

    "we consider dispersion , self - phase modulation and spectral gain filtering .",
    "the spatial effects include diffraction , self - focusing and a transverse gain profile .",
