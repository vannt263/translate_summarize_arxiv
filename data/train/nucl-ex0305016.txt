    "<S> a recently published experimental dependence of the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio on the measured , by a zero degree calorimeter , forward energy @xmath1 in pb+pb collisions at the cern sps is analyzed . using a model - independent approach </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the data are at variance with a earlier published experimental dependence of the same quantity on the transverse energy of neutral hadrons @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is related to a moderate centrality region : @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the number of participant nucleons ) and is peculiar only to the data obtained within the ` minimum bias ' analysis ( using the ` theoretical drell - yan ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> this could result from systematic experimental errors in the minimum bias sample . </S>",
    "<S> a possible source of the errors is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the na50 collaboration published new data on the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 suppression pattern in pb+pb collisions at cern sps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality of the collisions was estimated by measuring the energy of projectile spectator nucleons @xmath1 by a zero degree calorimeter . </S>",
    "<S> it was , however , mentioned @xcite that the new data may be at variance with the ones published by the same collaboration in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the transverse energy of produced neutral hadrons @xmath2 was used as a centrality estimator . the two sets of data ( for brevity , we shall call them respectively ` @xmath1 data ' and ` @xmath2 data ' ) , having very similar qualitative behavior , seem , nevertheless , to be at variance quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that using three completely different @xmath0 production models if a model is fitted to the @xmath2 data , it does not agree with the @xmath1-that and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> earlier it was mentioned @xcite that the co - mover model , which describes very well the @xmath2 data , does not show similar agreement with the @xmath1 set .    </S>",
    "<S> although the previous analysis pointed out a possible problem , its results can still be considered as inconclusive . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one may believe that the problem is related to the used models rather than to the data , and the ` truly correct model ' should agree with the both data sets simultaneously .    in this letter , we use a model - independent analysis of the data to show that _ any _ model would be at variance at least with one of the data sets . </S>",
    "<S> this points out presence of systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of data in each set , depending on the analysis procedure used to obtain the ratio @xmath5 of @xmath0 multiplicity to the multiplicity of drell - yan pairs . in the _ standard _ </S>",
    "<S> analysis , the number of both @xmath0 and drell - yan events are extracted from the measured dimuon spectra , i.e. the _ physical _ drell - yan is used as a reference . in the _ ` minimum bias ' _ </S>",
    "<S> analysis , only the number of @xmath0 events and the total number of collisions ( minimum bias events ) in each centrality bin are found from the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath5 is obtained by dividing the measured ratio of the number of @xmath0 events to the number of minimum bias events by the _ theoretical _ ratio of drell - yan multiplicity to the probability of a minimum bias collision at the corresponding centrality . </S>",
    "<S> then the overall factor is fixed using the standard analysis data . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical drell - yan to minimum bias ratio is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the average number of drell - yan dimuon pairs per pb+pb collision at impact parameter @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the probability that an interaction between two nuclei at impact parameter @xmath8 takes place . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities are calculated in the glauber approach . </S>",
    "<S> the subscript @xmath10 stands for @xmath11 or @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-distribution of events at fixed impact parameter @xmath8 , @xmath13 , is assumed to have a gaussian form with the central value and dispersion given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the average number of participant nucleons in a pb+pb collision at impact parameter @xmath8 calculated in the glauber approach . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter values @xmath16 gev and @xmath17 @xcite are fixed from the minimum bias transverse energy distribution @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-distribution @xmath18 is assumed to be a gaussian with the central value and dispersion given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    at </S>",
    "<S> a given dependence @xmath19 of the average number of @xmath0 s per pb+pb collision on the impact parameter @xmath8 , the ratio r in a finite - size @xmath20-bin , @xmath21 can be calculated as : @xmath22 in absence of essential systematic errors , the @xmath2- and @xmath1 data should be consistent with each other : the formula ( [ rint ] ) should fit the both data sets simultaneously : the @xmath23 per degree of freedom , @xmath24 , that includes @xmath2 as well as @xmath1 data points should be in the vicinity of @xmath25 . in the following we estimate in a model - independent way </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound for @xmath24 and show that it is in fact essentially larger than @xmath25 .    instead of @xmath23 per degree of freedom </S>",
    "<S> , we shall calculate the @xmath23 per experimental point , @xmath26 , which provides a lower estimate for @xmath24 : @xmath27 because @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> we approximate the unknown function @xmath19 in the following way :    * we fix @xmath29 nodes @xmath30 on the @xmath8-axes : @xmath31 , while @xmath32 is taken sufficiently large ( @xmath33 fm ) so that the probability of interaction of two pb - nuclei and nuclear modification of @xmath0 production at @xmath34 are negligibly small . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the rest of nodes in two different ways : + ( a ) equidistant @xmath35 and + ( b ) so that the difference of the average number of participant nucleons between every two neighboring nodes is the same : @xmath36 * the values of @xmath19 in all nodes except the last one : @xmath37 are treated as free parameters . the value in the node @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> is fixed assuming the same @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio in extremely peripheral pb+pb collisions as in p+p : @xmath38 * the value of @xmath19 between the nodes is given by a linear interpolation : @xmath39 * there is no reason to expect oscillating dependence of the @xmath0 multiplicity on the centrality . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath40 are subjected to the constraint @xmath41 which ensures monotonicity of the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio @xmath5 as function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> * one more constraint is needed to avoid negative values of @xmath0 multiplicity : @xmath42    any non - negative function @xmath19 related to a monotonic @xmath43 , including even a disconnected one , can be arbitrarily well approximated in the above way , provided that @xmath29 is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , minimizing of @xmath23 with respect to all @xmath40 , @xmath44 , at sufficiently large @xmath29 one gets the value , which is , at least , not larger than the minimum @xmath23 in _ any _ reasonable model .    using eqs.([rint ] ) and ( [ lin ] ) one gets a linear dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath40 : @xmath45 here @xmath46 } { \\int_{e_x^{(n),min}}^{e_x^{(n),max } } d e_x \\int_0^{\\infty } db b p(e_x|b ) \\langle dy(b ) \\rangle p_{int}(b ) } , \\ \\ j=1,\\dots , j-1 ; \\label{aj}\\\\ a_j^{(n ) } & = & \\frac { \\int_{e_x^{(n),min}}^{e_x^{(n),max } } d </S>",
    "<S> e_x a_{j}^{-}(e_x ) } { \\int_{e_x^{(n),min}}^{e_x^{(n),max } } d e_x \\int_0^{\\infty } db   b p(e_x|b ) \\langle dy(b ) \\rangle p_{int}(b ) } ; \\label{aj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47    in our fitting procedure , the initial values of @xmath40 are chosen randomly ( using a random number generator ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the @xmath23 is minimized in such a way that the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) is fulfilled at each iteration step .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of the fit of the na50 _ minimum bias _ </S>",
    "<S> data is presented in tab . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] and in figs.[fige_t ] and [ fige_zdc ] . as is seen from the table at @xmath48 the value of @xmath26 saturates and ceases to depend on the way , how the nodes are fixed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath49 can be accepted as sufficiently large to provide a reliable lower estimate for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> first , we fitted the @xmath2- and @xmath1 data separately ( ` @xmath2 fit ' and the ` @xmath1 fit ' , respectively ) . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the lower estimate of @xmath26 is smaller than 1 , which indicates that the difference between the data from 1996 and 1998 runs within each minimum bias dataset can be well explained by statistical fluctuations only . </S>",
    "<S> but if one compares the @xmath2 data and @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio , calculated with @xmath40 s found from the @xmath1 fit ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fige_t ] ) , one can observe clear discrepancy at moderate centrality ( @xmath50@xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar discrepancy is observed , when the @xmath1 dependence resulting from the @xmath2 fit is compared with the @xmath1 data .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we tried to fit the both sets simultaneously ( the ` combined fit ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show that @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath53 in any model . </S>",
    "<S> again , it is clearly seen from figs.[fige_t ] and [ fige_zdc ] that the problem is related to the centrality region @xmath50@xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy can not be explained by statistical fluctuations ( this hypothesis is excluded at the level of about @xmath54 ! ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at least one of the data sets contains essential systematic errors .    </S>",
    "<S> there are reasons to suspect that these are the @xmath1 data that contain the systematic errors and the source of these errors is a distortion of the minimum bias sample . indeed , a crucial point of the minimum bias analysis is the assumption that both the measured drell - yan multiplicity as well as the experimental minimum bias centrality distribution are exactly proportional to the corresponding theoretical values , i.e. to the numerator and denominator of eq.([theody ] ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental and theoretical minimum bias probabilities should cancel ( up to a constant factor ) , when one divides the _ experimental _ @xmath0 to minimum bias ratio by the _ </S>",
    "<S> theoretical _ drell - yan to minimum bias ratio ( [ theody ] ) , leaving finally only @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio .    while the experimental minimum bias @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> distribution perfectly agrees with the glauber model ( see fig . 1 of ref.@xcite ) , region , because the efficiency of the target identification algorithm is less than unity there . ] </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of the @xmath1 minimum bias distribution ( see fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) seems to be not so perfect . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the data plotted in ref.@xcite have never been published in numerical form and the value of @xmath55 characterizing the quality of the fit of the minimum bias @xmath1 distribution has not been quoted . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is seen from the plot that the experimental points lie slightly above the theoretical curves in the region @xmath56 tev ( which corresponds to @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the difference does not exceed even the size of the point symbols , it , nevertheless , indicates a sizable discrepancy , due to logarithmic scale of the vertical axis of the plot . because of this discrepancy , the measured and calculated minimum bias distribution do not cancel completely , which may lead to the observed systematic errors .    </S>",
    "<S> the question about the origin of the distortion of the minimum bias distribution is not simple . </S>",
    "<S> the final answer can hopefully be given after a detailed analysis of the raw experimental data supplemented by monte - carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this is out of the scope of our present analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves only to formulating a ` working hypothesis ' , which is to be tested in course of more detailed investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the observed discrepancy may come from interactions of reaction fragments with nuclei inside the zero degree calorimeter . </S>",
    "<S> if such an interaction takes place , a fraction of the produced particles ( those having large transverse momenta ) may leave the calorimeter without deposing their energy in it . </S>",
    "<S> this may cause losses of the zero - degree energy , which can result in distortion of the shape of the minimum bias distribution . </S>",
    "<S> if our hypothesis is correct , the data analysis procedure should be modified to take into account the losses of the zero degree energy . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the mentioned problem will persist even in a minimum bias analysis of the new , year 2000 data . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ distribution ] , one can easily see that the _ minimum bias _ sample is much more sensitive to this effect than the _ dimuon _ one . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if spectators from a _ peripheral _ collision loose an essential part of their energy , this event is registered by the apparatus as a _ moderate centrality _ collision . </S>",
    "<S> the number of peripheral minimum bias events is about an order of magnitude larger than the number of events at moderate centrality . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even if the fraction of peripheral events that suffer from losses of the zero degree energy is small , the contamination at moderate centrality can be sizable . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the number of drell - yan events at moderate centrality is larger than the number of peripheral ones . therefore the drell - yan sample is much less influenced . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by our comparison of the standard analysis data . </S>",
    "<S> even the newest data @xcite , which have smaller statistical errors than older ones , do not show any contradiction between @xmath2- and the @xmath1 data sets : according to our analysis , the lower bound of @xmath24 for the combined fit of the new standard analysis data is @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> the region of low @xmath1 ( @xmath58 tev ) , i.e. the region of the ` second drop ' of the @xmath1 data , deserves special attention . </S>",
    "<S> all models that have been successful describing the @xmath2 data at @xmath59 gev @xcite explain the ` second drop ' of the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio by @xmath2-losses in the dimuon event sample with respect to the minimum bias one and/or by the influence of @xmath2-fluctuations on the @xmath0 production or suppression . </S>",
    "<S> both effects do not influence the @xmath1 data , this means that _ all _ the models @xcite fail to describe the @xmath1 data at @xmath60 tev . </S>",
    "<S> if the drop at low @xmath1 indeed exists , the correct model should explain the high - centrality behavior of both @xmath2- and @xmath1 data by a sharp decrease of the @xmath0 multiplicity at small impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , not unlikely that the ` second drop ' in the @xmath1 data is an artifact of the data distortion </S>",
    "<S> . indeed , fig.1 of ref.@xcite shows clear disagreement of the minimum bias distribution with the glauber model at low @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this , as was explained above , invalidates the minimum bias analysis procedure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the apparent agreement between the @xmath2- and @xmath1 data in high centrality region obtained within our analysis ( see figs.[fige_t ] and [ fige_zdc ] ) may be purely accidental . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there would be no contradiction with the models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , refining of the @xmath1 data is very important </S>",
    "<S> . it would be hopefully able to narrow the set of successful models in this field , which recently became too broad .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a model independent comparison of two data sets published by the na50 collaboration : the @xmath2- and @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio @xmath5 in pb+pb collisions at sps . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the two sets are at variance . </S>",
    "<S> this problem seems to be related only to the data obtained within the minimum bias procedure . a possible reason for the problem may be a distortion of the minimum bias data sample . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that refining of the data is important to clarify the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the ratio @xmath5 at @xmath58 tev .    </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge the financial support of the alexander von humboldt foundation and gsi , germany . </S>"
