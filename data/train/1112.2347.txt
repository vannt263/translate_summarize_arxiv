    "quantum information processing differs significantly from processing of classical information .",
    "this is due to the fact that the space of all states allowed in the quantum theory is much richer than the space of classical states @xcite .",
    "thus an author of a quantum algorithm , writing a screenplay designed specially for the quantum scene , can rely on states and transformations not admitted by the classical theory .",
    "for instance , in the theory of classical information the standard operation of inversion of a bit , called the _ not _ gate , can not be represented as a concatenation of two identical operations on a bit .",
    "but the quantum theory allows one to construct the gate called @xmath5 , which performed twice is equivalent to the flip of a qubit .",
    "this simple example can be explained by comparing the geometries of classical and quantum state spaces .",
    "consider a system containing @xmath0 perfectly distinguishable states . in the classical case",
    "the set of classical states , equivalent to @xmath0point probability distributions , forms a regular simplex @xmath6 in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "hence the set of pure classical states consists of @xmath0 isolated points . in a quantum set - up the set of states @xmath8 , consisting of hermitian , positive and normalized density matrices ,",
    "has @xmath4 real dimensions . furthermore",
    ", the set of pure quantum states is connected , and for any two pure states there exist transformations that take us along a continuous path joining the two quantum pure states .",
    "this fact is one of the key differences between the classical and the quantum theories @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to provide an easy - to - read description of similarities and differences between the sets of classical and quantum states .",
    "already when @xmath9 the geometric structure of the eight dimensional set @xmath10 is not easy to analyse nor to describe @xcite .",
    "therefore we are going to use an _ apophatic approach _ , in which one tries to describe the properties of a given object by specifying simple features it _ does not _ have .",
    "then we use a more conventional @xcite constructive approach and investigate two - dimensional cross - sections and projections of the set @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thereby a cross - section is defined as the intersection of a given set with an affine space .",
    "we happily recommend a very recent work for a more exhaustive discussion of the cross - sections @xcite .",
    "a classical state is a probability vector @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 . assuming that a pure quantum state @xmath15 belongs to an @xmath0dimensional hilbert space @xmath16 , a general quantum state is a density matrix @xmath17 of size @xmath0 , which is hermitian , @xmath18 , with positive eigenvalues , @xmath19 , and normalized , tr@xmath20 .",
    "note that any density matrix can be diagonalised , and then it has a probability vector along its diagonal .",
    "but clearly the space of all quantum states @xmath8 is significantly larger than the space of all classical states ",
    "there are @xmath7 free parameters in the probability vector , but there are @xmath4 free parameters in the density matrix .",
    "the space of states , classical or quantum , is always a _ convex _ set . by definition",
    "a convex set is a subset of euclidean space , such that given any two points in the subset the line segment between the two points also belongs to that subset .",
    "the points in the interior of the line segment are said to be _ mixtures _ of the original points .",
    "points that can not be written as mixtures of two distinct points are called _ extremal _ or _",
    "pure_. taking all mixtures of three pure points we get a triangle @xmath21 , mixtures of four pure points form a tetrahedron @xmath22 , etc .    the individuality of a convex set is expressed on its boundary .",
    "each point on the boundary belongs to a _ face _ , which is in itself a convex subset . to qualify as a face this convex subset",
    "must also be such that for all possible ways of decomposing any of its points into pure states , these pure states themselves belong to the subset .",
    "we will see that the boundary of @xmath8 is quite different from the boundary of the set of classical states .      the simplest convex body one can think of is a _ simplex _",
    "@xmath6 with @xmath0 pure states at its corners .",
    "the set of all classical states forms such a simplex , with the probabilities @xmath23 telling us how much of the @xmath24th pure state that has been mixed in .",
    "the simplex is the only convex set which is such that a given point can be written as a mixture of pure states in one and only one way .",
    "the number @xmath25 of non ",
    "zero components of the vector @xmath26 is called the rank of the state .",
    "a state of rank one is pure and corresponds to a corner of the simplex .",
    "any point inside the simplex @xmath6 has full rank , @xmath27 .",
    "the boundary of the set of classical states is formed by states with rank smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "each face is itself a simplex @xmath28 .",
    "corners and edges are special cases of faces . a face of dimension one less than that of the set itself is called a _ facet_.    it is natural to think of the simplex as a regular simplex , with all its edges having length one .",
    "this can always be achieved , by defining the distance between two probability vectors @xmath26 and @xmath29 as    @xmath30 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(p_i - q_i)^2 } \\ .\\ ] ]    the geometry is that of euclid . with this geometry in place",
    "we can ask for the _ outsphere _ , the smallest sphere that surrounds the simplex , and the _ insphere _ , the largest sphere inscribed in it . let the radius of the outsphere be @xmath31 and that of the insphere be @xmath32 .",
    "one finds that @xmath33 .",
    "another simple example of a convex set is a three dimensional ball .",
    "the pure states sit on its surface , and each such point is a zero dimensional face .",
    "there are no higher dimensional faces ( unless we count the entire ball as a face ) . given a point that is not pure it is now possible to decompose it in infinitely many ways as a mixture of pure states .",
    "remarkably this ball is the space of states @xmath34 of a single _ qubit _ , the simplest quantum mechanical state space . for concreteness",
    "introduce the pauli matrices @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "these three matrices form an orthonormal basis for the set of traceless hermitian matrices of size two , or in other words for the lie algebra of @xmath38 .",
    "if we add the identity matrix @xmath39 , we can expand an arbitrary state @xmath17 in this basis as @xmath40 where the expansion coefficients are @xmath41 .",
    "these three numbers are real since the matrix @xmath17 is hermitian .",
    "the three dimensional vector @xmath42 is called the _",
    "bloch vector _ ( or coherence vector ) .",
    "if @xmath43 we have the _ maximally mixed state_. pure states are represented by projectors , @xmath44 .",
    "bloch_kugel.png    since the pauli matrices are traceless the coefficient @xmath45 standing in front of the identity matrix assures that tr@xmath20 , but we must also ensure that all eigenvalues are non - negative . by computing the determinant",
    "we find that this is so if and only if the length of the bloch vector is bounded , @xmath46 . hence @xmath34 is indeed a solid ball , with the pure states forming its surface  the _ bloch sphere_.    a simple but important point is that the set of classical states @xmath47 , which is just a line segment in this case , sits inside the bloch ball as one of its diameters .",
    "this goes for any diameter , since we are free to regard any two commuting projectors as our classical bit .",
    "two commuting projectors sit at antipodal points on the bloch sphere . to ensure that the distance between any pair of antipodal equals one we define the distance between two density matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 to be    @xmath50 }   \\ .",
    "\\label{hsdist}\\ ] ]    this is known as the _ hilbert - schmidt distance_. let us express this in the cartesian coordinate system provided by the bloch vector ,    @xmath51 \\ = \\",
    "\\sqrt { \\sum_{i=1}^3   ( \\tau^a_i -\\tau^b_i)^2 } \\ = \\     this is the euclidean notion of distance .      when @xmath52 the quantum state space is no longer a solid ball .",
    "it is always a convex set however . given two density matrices , that is to say two positive hermitian matrices @xmath53 .",
    "it is then easy to see that any convex combination of these two states , @xmath54 where @xmath55 $ ] , must be a positive matrix too , and hence it belongs to @xmath8 .",
    "this shows that the set of quantum states is convex . for all @xmath0 the face structure of the boundary",
    "can be discussed in a unified way .",
    "moreover it remains true that @xmath8 is swept out by rotating a classical probability simplex @xmath6 in @xmath56 , but for @xmath52 there are restrictions on the allowed rotations .    to make these properties explicit we start with the observation that any density matrix can be represented as a convex combination of pure states @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a probability vector .",
    "in contrast to the classical case there exist infinitely many decompositions of any mixed state @xmath59 .",
    "the number @xmath60 can be arbitrarily large , and many different choices can be made for the pure states @xmath61 .",
    "but there does exist a distinguished decomposition . diagonalising the density matrix we find its eigenvalues @xmath62 and eigenvectors @xmath63",
    "this allows us to write the eigendecomposition of a state , @xmath64 the number @xmath25 of non - zero components of the probability vector @xmath65 is called the rank of the state @xmath17 , and does not exceed @xmath0 .",
    "this is the usual definition of the rank of a matrix , and by happy accident it agrees with the definition of rank in convex set theory : the _ rank _ of a point in a convex set is the smallest number of pure points needed to form the given point as a mixture .",
    "consider now a general convex set in @xmath66 dimensions .",
    "any point belonging to it can be represented by a convex combination of not more than @xmath67 extremal states .",
    "interestingly , @xmath8 has a peculiar geometric structure since any given density operator @xmath17 can be represented by a combination of not more than @xmath0 pure states , which is much smaller than @xmath68 . in hilbert space",
    "these @xmath0 pure states are the orthogonal eigenvectors of @xmath17 . if we adopt the hilbert - schmidt definition of distance ( [ hsdist ] ) they form a copy of the classical state space , the regular simplex @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , every density matrix can be reached from a diagonal density matrix by means of an @xmath69 transformation .",
    "such transformations form a subgroup of the rotation group @xmath70 .",
    "therefore any density matrix can be obtained by rotating a classical probability simplex around the maximally mixed state , which is left invariant by rotations . however , when @xmath52 @xmath69 is a proper subgroup of @xmath70 , which is why @xmath8 forms a solid ball only if @xmath71 .",
    "the relative sizes of the outsphere and the insphere are still related by @xmath33 .",
    "dens3.png    [ fig : densthree ]    the boundary of the set @xmath8 shows some similarities with that of its classical cousin .",
    "it consists of all matrices whose rank is smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "there will be faces of rank 1 ( the pure states ) , of rank 2 ( in themselves they are copies of @xmath34 ) , and so on up to faces of rank @xmath7 ( copies of @xmath72 ) .",
    "note that there are no hard edges : the minimal non - extremal faces are solid three dimensional balls .",
    "the largest faces have a dimension much smaller than the dimension of the boundary of @xmath8 . as in the classical case",
    ", any face can be described as the intersection of the convex set with a bounding hyperplane in the container space . in technical language one",
    "says that all faces are exposed .",
    "note also that every point on the boundary belongs to a face that is tangent to the insphere .",
    "this has the interesting consequence that the area @xmath73 of the boundary is related to the volume @xmath74 of the body by @xmath75 where @xmath25 is the radius of the insphere and @xmath66 is the dimension of the body ( in this case @xmath76 ) @xcite .",
    "incidentally the volume of @xmath8 is known explicitly @xcite .",
    "there are differences too .",
    "a typical state on the boundary has rank @xmath7 , and any two such states can be connected with a curve of states such that all states on the curve have the same rank . in this sense @xmath8",
    "is more like an egg than a polytope @xcite .",
    "we can regard the set of @xmath0 by @xmath0 matrices as a vector space ( called hilbert - schmidt space ) , endowed with the scalar product @xmath77 the set of hermitian matrices with unit trace is not a vector space as it stands , but it can be made into one by separating out the traceless part .",
    "thus we can represent a density matrix as    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is traceless .",
    "the set of traceless matrices is an euclidean subspace of hilbert - schmidt space , and the hilbert - schmidt distance ( [ hsdist ] ) arises from this scalar product . in close analogy to eq .",
    "( [ bloch2 ] ) we can introduce a basis for the set of traceless matrices , and write the density matrix in the _",
    "generalized bloch vector _ representation , @xmath80 here @xmath81 are hermitian basis vectors .",
    "the components @xmath82 must be chosen such that @xmath17 is a positive definite matrix .",
    "both the classical and the quantum state spaces have the remarkable property that they are _ self - dual_. but the word duality has many meanings .",
    "in projective geometry the dual of a point is a plane .",
    "if the point is represented by a vector @xmath83 , we can define the dual plane as the set of vectors @xmath84 such that    @xmath85    the dual of a line is the intersection of a one - parameter family of planes dual to the points on the line .",
    "this is in itself a line .",
    "the dual of a plane is a point , while the dual of a curved surface is another curved surface  the envelope of the planes that are dual to the points on the original surface . to define the dual of a convex body with a given boundary we change the definition slightly , and include all points on one side of the dual planes in the dual .",
    "thus the _ dual _ @xmath86 of a convex body @xmath87 is defined to be    @xmath88    the dual of a convex body including the origin is the intersection of half - spaces @xmath89 for extremal points @xmath84 of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "if we enlarge a convex body the conditions on the dual become more stringent , and hence the dual shrinks .",
    "the dual of a sphere centred at the origin is again a sphere , so a sphere ( of suitable radius ) is self - dual .",
    "the dual of a cube is an octahedron .",
    "the dual of a regular tetrahedron is another copy of the original tetrahedron , possibly of a different size .",
    "hence this is a self - dual body .",
    "convex subsets @xmath90 are mapped to subsets of @xmath86 by @xmath91 geometrically , @xmath92 equals @xmath86 intersected with the dual affine space ( [ eq : dualplane ] ) of the affine span of @xmath93 .",
    "if the origin lies in the interior of the convex body @xmath87 then @xmath94 is a one - to - one inclusion - reversing correspondence between the exposed faces of @xmath87 and of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath87 is a tetrahedron , then vertices and faces are exchanged , while edges go to edges .    what we need in order to prove the self - duality of @xmath8 is the key fact that a hermitian and unit trace matrix @xmath95 is a density matrix if and only if    @xmath96    for all density matrices @xmath17 .",
    "it will be convenient to think of a density matrix @xmath17 as represented by a `` vector '' @xmath79 , as in eq .",
    "( [ vectors ] ) . as a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ rhosigma ] ) the set of quantum states @xmath8 is self - dual in the precise sense that    @xmath97    in this equation the trace is to be interpreted as a scalar product in a vector space . duality ( [ eq : dual_face ] ) exchanges faces of rank @xmath25 ( copies of @xmath98 ) and faces of rank @xmath99 ( copies of @xmath100 ) .",
    "self - duality is a key property of state spaces @xcite , and we will use it extensively when we discuss projections and cross - sections of @xmath8 .",
    "this notion is often introduced in the larger vector space consisting of all hermitian matrices , with the origin at the zero matrix .",
    "the set of positive semi - definite matrices forms a cone in this space , with its apex at the origin .",
    "it is a cone because any positive semi - definite matrix remains positive semi - definite if multiplied by a positive real number .",
    "this defines the rays of the cone , and each ray intersects the set of unit trace matrices exactly once .",
    "the dual of this cone is the set of all matrices @xmath101 such that tr@xmath102 for all matrices @xmath103 within the cone  and indeed the dual cone is equal to the original , so it is self - dual .",
    "for @xmath104 we are dealing with the states of the _ qutrit_. the gell - mann matrices are a standard choice @xcite for the eight matrices @xmath81 , and the expansion coefficients are @xmath105 .",
    "unfortunately , although the sufficient conditions for @xmath106 to represent a state are known @xcite , they do not improve much our understanding of the geometry of @xmath10 .",
    "we know that the set of pure states has 4 real dimensions , and that the faces of @xmath10 are copies of the 3d bloch ball , filling out the 7 dimensional boundary .",
    "the centres of these balls touch the largest inscribed sphere of @xmath10 . but what does it all really look like ?    we try to answer this question by presenting some 3d objects , and explaining why they can not serve as models of @xmath10 . apart from the fact that our objects are not eight dimensional , all of them lack some other features of the set of quantum states .",
    "[ fig1a ] presents a hairy set which is nice but not convex .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a ball , and we know that @xmath10 is not a ball .",
    "it is not a polytope either , so the polytope shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can not model the set of quantum states .",
    "wlos.jpg    tenis.jpg    gran.jpg    let us have a look at the cylinder shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and locate the extremal points of the convex body shown .",
    "this subset consists of the two circles surrounding both bases .",
    "this is a disconnected set , in contrast to the connected set of pure quantum states .",
    "however , if one splits the cylinder into two halves and rotates one half by @xmath107 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , one obtains a body with a connected set of pure states . a similar model can be obtained by taking the convex hull of the seam of a tennis ball : the one dimensional seam contains the extremal points of this set and forms a connected set .",
    "model1.jpg    model2.jpg    thus the seam of the tennis ball ( look again at fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) corresponds to the @xmath108 connected set of pure states of @xmath9 quantum system .",
    "the convex hull of the seam forms a @xmath109 object which is easy to visualize , and serves as our first rough model of the solid @xmath110 body @xmath10 of qutrit states .",
    "however , a characteristic feature of the latter is that each one of its points belongs to a cross - section which is an equilateral triangle @xmath21 .",
    "( this is the eigenvector decomposition . )",
    "the convex set determined by the seam of the tennis ball , and the set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , do not have this property .",
    "curve.png c.png    as we have seen @xmath10 can be obtained if we take an equilateral triangle @xmath21 and subject it to @xmath111 rotations in eight dimensions .",
    "we can try to do something similar in three dimensions .",
    "if we rotate a triangle along one of its bisections we obtain a cone , for which the set of extremal states consists of a circle and an apex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : steiner_cayley ] b ) ) , a disconnected set .",
    "we obtain a better model if we consider the space curve @xmath112 note that the curve is closed , @xmath113 , and belongs to the unit sphere , @xmath114 .",
    "moreover @xmath115 for every value of @xmath116 .",
    "hence every point @xmath117 belongs to an equilateral triangle with vertices at @xmath118 they span a plane including the @xmath119-axis for all times @xmath116 . during the time @xmath120 this plane makes a full turn about the @xmath119-axis , while the triangle rotates by the angle @xmath121 within the plane  so the triangle has returned to a congruent position .",
    "the curve @xmath117 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hull_curve ] a ) together with exemplary positions of the rotating triangle , and fig .",
    "[ fig : hull_curve ] b ) shows its convex hull @xmath122 .",
    "this convex hull is symmetric under reflections in the @xmath123-@xmath124 and @xmath123-@xmath125 planes . since the set of pure states",
    "is connected this is our best model so far of the set of quantum pure states , although the likeness is not perfect .",
    "it is interesting to think a bit more about the boundary of @xmath122 .",
    "there are three flat faces , two triangular ones and one rectangular . the remaining part of the boundary consists of ruled surfaces : they are curved , but contain one dimensional faces ( straight lines ) . the boundary of the set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] has similar properties .",
    "the ruled surfaces of @xmath122 have an analogue in the boundary of the set of quantum states @xmath10 , we have already noted that a generic point in the boundary of @xmath10 belongs to a copy of @xmath34 ( the bloch ball ) , arising as the intersection of @xmath10 with a hyperplane .",
    "the flat pieces of @xmath122 have no analogues in the boundary of @xmath10 , apart from bloch balls ( rank two ) and pure states ( rank one ) no other faces exist .",
    "still this model is not perfect : its set of pure states has self - intersections .",
    "although it is created by rotating a triangle , the triangles are not cross - sections of @xmath122 .",
    "it is not true that every point on the boundary belongs to a face that touches the largest inscribed sphere , as it happens for the set of quantum states @xcite .",
    "indeed its boundary is not quite what we want it to be , in particular it has non - exposed faces  a point to which we will return . above all",
    "this is not a self - dual body .",
    "the properties of the eight - dimensional convex set @xmath10 might conflict if we try to realize them in dimension three . instead of looking for an ideal three dimensional model we shall thus use a complementary approach .",
    "to reduce the dimensionality of the problem we investigate cross - sections of the @xmath110 set @xmath10 with a plane of dimension two or three , as well as its orthogonal projections on these planes ",
    "the shadows cast by the body on the planes , when illuminated by a very distant light source . clearly the cross - sections will always be contained in the projections , but in exceptional cases they may coincide .",
    "what kind of cross - sections arise ? in the classical case it is known that every convex polytope arises as a cross - section of a simplex @xmath6 of sufficiently high dimension @xcite .",
    "it is also true that every convex polytope arises as the projection of a simplex .",
    "but what are the cross - sections and the projections of @xmath8 ?",
    "there has been considerable progress on this question recently .",
    "the convex set is said to be a _ spectrahedron _ if it is a cross - section of a cone of semi - positive definite matrices of some given size . in the branch of mathematics known as",
    "convex algebraic geometry one asks what kind of convex bodies that can be obtained as projections of spectrahedra .",
    "surprisingly , the convex hull of any trigonometric space curve in three dimensions can be so obtained @xcite .",
    "this includes our set @xmath122 , which can be shown to be a projection of an @xmath126-dimensional cross - section of the @xmath127 set @xmath128 of quantum states of size @xmath129 .",

    ". there exists a beautiful relation between projections and cross - sections , holding for self - dual convex bodies such as the classical and the quantum state spaces @xcite . for them cross - sections and projections",

    "so far we have discussed the qutrit , and properties of the qutrit that generalise to any dimension @xmath0 . but",
    "what is special about a quantum system whose hilbert space has dimension @xmath0 ?",
    "the question gains some relevance from recent attempts to find direct experimental signatures of the dimension ,    one obvious answer is that if and only if @xmath0 is a composite number , the system admits a description in terms of entangled subsystems .",
    "but we can look for an answer in other directions too .",
    "we emphasised that a regular simplex @xmath6 can be inscribed in the quantum state space @xmath8 .",
    "but in the bloch ball we can clearly inscribe not only @xmath47 ( a line segment ) , but also @xmath21 ( a triangle ) and @xmath22 ( a tetrahedron ) .",
    "if we insist that the vertices of the inscribed simplex should lie on the outsphere of @xmath8 , and also that the simplex should be centred at the maximally mixed state , then this gives rise to a non - trivial problem once the dimension @xmath52 .",
    "this is clear from our model of the latter as the convex hull of the seam of a tennis ball , or in other words because the set of pure states form a very small subset of the outsphere .",
    "still we saw , in fig .",
    "[ fig : steiner_cayley ] a ) , that not only @xmath21 but also @xmath22 can be inscribed in @xmath10 , and as a matter of fact so can @xmath162 and @xmath163 . but",
    "is it always possible to inscribe the regular simplex @xmath164 in @xmath8 , in such a way that the @xmath165 vertices are pure states ?",
    "although the answer is not obvious , it is perhaps surprising to learn that the answer is not known , despite a considerable amount of work in recent years .",
    "the inscribed regular simplices @xmath164 are known as symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures , or sic - povms for short .",
    "their existence has been established , by explicit construction , in all dimensions @xmath166 and in a handful of larger dimensions .",
    "the conjecture is that they always exist @xcite .",
    "but the available constructions have so far not revealed any pattern allowing one to write down a solution for all dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "already here the quantum state space begins to show some @xmath0-dependent individuality .",
    "another question where the dimension matters concerns complementary bases in hilbert space .",
    "as we have seen , given a basis in hilbert space , there is an @xmath167-dimensional cross - section of @xmath8 in which these vectors appear as the vertices of a regular simplex @xmath6 .",
    "we can  for instance for tomographic reasons @xcite  decide to look for two such cross - sections placed in such a way that they are totally orthogonal with respect to the trace inner product .",
    "if the two cross - sections are spanned by two regular simplices stemming from two hilbert space bases @xmath168 and @xmath169 , then the requirement on the bases is that    @xmath170    for all @xmath171 .",
    "such bases are said to be complementary , and form a key element in the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "but do they exist for all @xmath0 ?",
    "the answer is yes . to see this ,",
    "let one basis be the computational one , and let the other be expressed in terms of it as the column vectors of the fourier matrix    @xmath172 \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath173 is a primitive root of unity .",
    "the fourier matrix is an example of a _ complex hadamard matrix _ , a unitary matrix all of whose matrix elements have the same modulus .",
    "we are interested in finding all possible complementary pairs up to unitary equivalences .",
    "the latter are largely fixed by requiring that one member of the pair is the computational basis , since the second member will then be defined by a complex hadamard matrix .",
    "the remaining freedom is taken into account by declaring two complex hadamard matrices @xmath155 and @xmath174 to be equivalent if they can be related by    @xmath175    where @xmath176 are diagonal unitary matrices and @xmath177 are permutation matrices .",
    "the task of classifying pairs of cross - sections of @xmath8 forming simplices @xmath6 and sitting in totally orthogonal @xmath0-planes is therefore equivalent to the problem of classifying complementary pairs of bases in hilbert space .",
    "this problem in turn is equivalent to the problem of classifying complex hadamard matrices of a given size .",
    "but the latter problem has been open since it was first raised by sylvester and hadamard , back in the nineteenth century .",
    "it has been completely solved only for @xmath178 , and it was recently almost completely solved for @xmath179 @xcite .    more is known if we restrict ourselves to continuous families of complex hadamard matrices that include the fourier matrix .",
    "then it has been known for some time @xcite that the dimension of such a family is bounded from above by    @xmath180    where gcd denotes the largest common divisor , and gcd@xmath181 .",
    "we subtracted the @xmath182 dimensions that arise trivially from eq .",
    "( [ haagerup ] ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath183 is a power of prime number @xmath184 this bound is saturated by families that have been constructed explicitly . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath0 is a prime number @xmath185 , and the fourier matrix is an isolated solution . for @xmath186 on the other hand there exists a one - parameter family of inequivalent complex hadamard matrices .",
    "further results on this question were presented in biaowiea @xcite .",
    "in particular the above bound is not achieved for any @xmath0 not equal to a prime power and not equal to 6 .",
    "it turns out that the answer depends critically on the nature of the prime number decomposition of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is a product of two odd primes the answer will look different from the case when @xmath0 is twice an odd prime .",
    "however , at the moment , the largest non - prime power dimension for which the answer is known  even for this restricted form of the problem  is @xmath187 .    at the moment then , both the sic problem and the problem of complementary pairs of bases highlight the fact that the choice of hilbert space dimension @xmath0 has some dramatic consequences for the geometry of @xmath8 . now the basic intuition that drove mielnik s attempts to generalize quantum mechanics was the feeling that the nature of the physical system should be reflected in the geometry of its convex body of states @xcite . perhaps this intuition will eventually be vindicated within quantum mechanics itself , in such a way that the individuality of the system is expressed in the choice of @xmath0 ?",
