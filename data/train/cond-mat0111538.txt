    "nematic elastomers display three unique and related phenomena not found in conventional elasticity - large spontaneous deformations , very large optical - mechanical response and soft elasticity .",
    "the last , shape change with little or no energy cost , is the subject of this paper .",
    "we give a geometric interpretation of the soft modes described using fractional powers of tensors .",
    "we then discuss the soft modes of biaxial nematic elastomers .",
    "since in contrast to conventional elastic solids , rotations play an essential role in the elasticity of nematic rubber , we conclude by discussing the related questions of breaking finite strains into symmetric shears and rotations , the polar decomposition theorem for tensors , and the nature of square roots of tensors .",
    "nematic elastomers have an internal , orientational degree of freedom in addition to those of ordinary elastic bodies .",
    "the anisotropy of molecular orientation induces shape anisotropy in the polymers that make up the elastomer .",
    "the switching on and off of this molecular shape anisotropy , either by temperature change@xcite or by illumination@xcite , causes large ( @xmath0 ) mechanical shape changes .",
    "rotation of this anisotropy , by imposed mechanical strains , is the extreme opto - mechanical effect that is observed .",
    "when accompanied by subsidiary shears and contractions which accommodate the changes of molecular distributions , the cost of the originally imposed strain is rendered to zero .",
    "this is what we call soft elasticity@xcite .",
    "one can explore the related ideas of anisotropy , rotation and soft elasticity initially for small deformations and rotations , that is within the linear continuum theory of a uniaxial body with a mobile director @xmath1 that characterises the anisotropy direction@xcite .",

    "the latter terms are those of the relative rotation @xmath8 coupling : for small rotations , the director variation corresponds to a rotation @xmath9 or @xmath10 , see fig .",
    "[ directorrot ] .",
    "similarly , a small rotation @xmath11 of the matrix causes a vector @xmath12 in the body to suffer the change @xmath13 .",
    "the net rotation of @xmath1 with respect to the matrix inflicted by the relative rotation @xmath14 of the matrix ( @xmath15 ) relative to the changing director ( @xmath16 ) accordingly gives a relative change in @xmath1 of : = ( - )  .",
    "the directors @xmath1 and @xmath17 before and after application of strain are not distinguished in the first terms of equation ( [ peterf ] ) for small director rotation , but clearly must be in the relative rotation coupling terms in @xmath2 .",
    "the tensor @xmath18 is the strain before it has been made traceless , that is , it still has volume changes @xmath19 in it . since rubber is a soft material , its deformations are at constant volume and we neglect the first two terms in equation ( [ peterf ] ) since they involve volume change .",
    "the geometry of the remaining strains is vital and shown in fig .",
    "[ directions ] .",
    "the de gennes @xcite relative rotation couplings are unique to nematic networks because they require an independent , rotational degree of freedom , i.e. , the rotations @xmath16 of the director * n*. its motion in the medium is coupled to the body rotation @xmath20 . hence , the elastic energy unusually involves _ antisymmetric _ components of shear strain . in section [ rss ] ,",
    "we accordingly show how to extract the rotational component from any finite shear .",
    "the first coupling , @xmath21 , purely resists the rotation of the director relative to a rotating , undeformed matrix .",
    "the @xmath22 term couples @xmath1 to the symmetric part of shear in the plane that involves @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath23 if @xmath24 in equilibrium ) .",
    "these are the shears @xmath25 and @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ directions ] . since infinitesimal , incompressible symmetric",
    "shear is equivalent to stretch along one diagonal and compression along another , it is reasonable that prolate molecules will reduce the cost of distortion by rotating their ordering direction to being as much as possible along the elongation diagonal , depicted in fig .",
    "oblate elastomers rotate their director toward the compression diagonal to achieve the appropriate elastic accommodation .",
    "the spheroid represents the anisotropic shape distribution of the crosslinked polymers from which the network is composed .    a theorem of golubovic and lubensky ( gl ) @xcite shows that on symmetry grounds any solid with an internal degree of freedom which is also capable of reaching an isotropic reference state must be invariant under the double set of rotations of both the reference and target states when considering elastic deformations",
    "this has the remarkable consequence that some elastic deformations must be soft .",
    "this was discovered independently and in a superficially different form when studying at finite deformations the elastic response of nematic elastomers @xcite .",
    "we sketch how this can be understood for elastomers in order to explain the complex soft modes we shall later discuss .    an effective shear modulus arises for an imposed elastic strain , when the nematic director is free to evolve optimally .",
    "the elastic modulus @xmath27 is reduced ; by the symmetry argument it must vanish to give no overall energy cost .",
    "if the local rotational component @xmath11 of the deformation of the elastic matrix and the rotation of the director are coaxial , i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath28 are parallel and uniform , the argument is simple .",

    "we can now unite this expression with the rest of the elastic energy density , equation ( [ peterf ] ) and thus obtain the effective rubber - elastic energy which depends only on strains ; the director does not appear .",
    "for instance , in the specific coordinates of fig .",
    "[ directions ] : @xmath35    the modulus @xmath27 is renormalised to @xmath36 which by the gl theorem must be zero , thus establishing a relation between the constants @xmath27 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the molecular model , required below for finite deformations , produces linear continuum limiting values which also give : @xmath37    olmsted @xcite first proposed this continuum mechanism behind the golubovic ",
    "lubensky theorem : shape depends on the orientation of an internal ( nematic ) degree of freedom , the rotation of which causes a natural shape change at zero cost for suitable solids . a general discussion of the gl argument and its extension to semi - softness and thresholds to rotation is given in @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence for mechanically soft distortions is also discussed there .",
    "one can picture the continuous rotation generating mechanical distortion at low energy cost , see fig .",
    "the natural long axis of the body , as defined by the principal axis of molecular shape , rotates in an attempt to follow the apparent extension axis . to the extent that macroscopic shape change can thus be imitated",
    ", there is no real accompanying distortion of polymer shape .",
    "we quantify this picture below when considering non - linear elasticity theory .",
    "a simple extension of classical rubber elasticity theory to nematic elastomers gives for the free energy density : f=[trace ] where @xmath38 is the rubber elastic shear modulus in the isotropic phase and @xmath39 is the homogeneous deformation ( gradient ) .",
    "if we take @xmath40 to be @xmath41 , then the symmetric part of @xmath42 is identical to @xmath43 of ( [ peterf ] ) in the infinitesimal limit .",
    "the chains are no longer characterised by spherical gaussian distributions as in the classical case , but in general by anisotropic distributions .",
    "thus the effective step length tensors @xmath44 initially and @xmath45 currently after a distortion @xmath46 are prolate ( or oblate ) spheroids defining the second moments that characterise the gaussian distribution of chain spans @xmath47 in the the network , that is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the arc length of a chain .",
    "thus a measure of the mean size of a chain is @xmath50 where we shall soon define the roots of tensors more carefully .",
    "the tensor @xmath45 has one principal value @xmath51 along @xmath52 and @xmath53 perpendicular to @xmath52 ; thus @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the extracted @xmath53 factor from @xmath56 cancels with the @xmath57 factor extracted from @xmath58 when both tensors appear together in the trace formula ( [ trace ] ) and we can henceforth just consider the @xmath45 tensors in their reduced form that simply depends on the intrinsic anisotropy @xmath59 .",
    "anisotropy varies between @xmath60 . in this model of rubber",
    "elasticity the spontaneous elongation , @xmath61 , on going from the isotropic to the nematic phase turns out to be @xmath62 and is thus a direct measure of @xmath59 . indeed spontaneous elongations in the range of @xmath63 are observed .    now distortions @xmath46 are no longer small , but must continue to respect volume conservation , @xmath64 in the non - linear regime .",
    "the directors @xmath65 and @xmath52 , of the initial and current nematic states , may be greatly rotated from each other .",
    "the remainder of this paper is concerned with explaining the character of the soft modes within finite elasticity theory and extending this picture to that of soft modes in biaxial nematic elastomers .",
    "we explore the role of rotations and the connections between the isolation of rotational components of strain at finite amplitude ( the spherical decomposition theorem ) and the relation of the roots of tensors to this picture .",
    "consider the strain @xcite : = ^1/2 _ ^-1/2 , [ softdeform ] where @xmath66 is an arbitrary rotation by an angle @xmath67 .",
    "there are two continuous degrees of freedom describing the rotation connecting @xmath1 and @xmath68 and three degrees of freedom for the rotation @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the strain @xmath40 is described by five continuous degrees of freedom and thus represents a large set of deformations .",
    "if we insert such a strain into the trace formula ( [ trace ] ) , as well as its transpose @xmath69 ( equivalent to @xmath70 since the @xmath45 are symmetric ) we obtain : f & = & + & & = .",

    "two remarkable consequences immediately follow from nematic elastomer response via rotation :    impose an @xmath79-extension @xmath80 .",

    "[ deg2 ] is an intermediate step .",
    "softness must come to an end when the rotation is complete and the @xmath34 dimension has diminished in the proportion @xmath88 and the @xmath79 dimension extended in the proportion @xmath89 .",
    "the original sizes @xmath90 and @xmath91 have transformed to @xmath91 and @xmath90 respectively . thus softness would cease and director rotation be complete at @xmath92 .",
    "the strain @xmath93 is the spontaneous extension suffered on cooling to the nematic phase .",
    "likewise one can imagine from an oblique form of figure [ visual ] that if the initial director @xmath68 ( long axis of the shape ellipsoid ) is not at @xmath94 to the imposed strain , then rotation and softness is complete at a smaller @xmath95 .",

    "( the additional rotation is not necessarily coaxial with that which took @xmath99 to @xmath1 . ) not unexpectedly , we see the effect of @xmath193 compounded with the rotations implicit in @xmath58 since they both live in the target space .",
    "other approaches have been taken @xcite to soft elasticity which apparently circumvent the necessity to follow orientations in both spaces , and restore objectivity .",
    "one can measure all deformations @xmath46 from an isotropic reference state , that is there is encoded into the @xmath46 first a spontaneous deformation to current conditions of temperature , then a deformation imposed with respect to this intermediate state . under these conditions the free energy must automatically be invariant under operations of @xmath181 , since the reference state is isotropic and without a director @xmath65 to keep track of .",
    "difficulties arise then when nematic elastomers are only _ semi - soft _ , that is , they do not deform entirely at constant free energy , because they do not have a high temperature isotropic reference state . however they do suffer director rotation , very low energy trajectories in @xmath46 space and a lack of @xmath194 relaxation perpendicular to the plane of @xmath52 s rotation @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the complete cancellation rendering @xmath195 fails , but nevertheless deformations are qualitatively soft and one has to keep track of both directions @xmath65 and @xmath52 as strain evolves .",
    "we quote the classical conditions@xcite for the square roots of tensors , that arise too in the all - important condition for polar decomposition that is required for nematic elastomers .    if @xmath196 is non - singular , with @xmath38 distinct eigenvalues and with @xmath197 jordan blocks , then @xmath196 has @xmath198 and @xmath199 non - singular square roots .",
    "at least one of these roots is a polynomial in @xmath196 .",
    "the proof of the polar decomposition theorem ( pdt ) also offers a practical algorithm for decomposition : take a non - singular @xmath40 and construct the manifestly symmetric @xmath200 .",
    "take the square root , @xmath201 , of @xmath200 that is a polynomial in @xmath200 .",
    "since @xmath200 is symmetric , then so is @xmath202 .",
    "then define @xmath203 .",
    "clearly @xmath204 , that is @xmath205 represents rotations . from this one recovers @xmath206 .",
    "we investigate the special case of uniaxial soft modes in the @xmath207 plane .",
    "they are achieved by rotating the chain distribution around the the @xmath84 axis .",
    "the resulting deformation keeps the @xmath84-components of the body constant .",
    "hence these soft modes are effectively @xmath208 and can be easily related to equation ( [ parasoft2 ] ) and fig . [ softstrains_b ] .",
    "an explicit example of the pdt for decomposing a general @xmath207-distortion @xmath46 into a combination of symmetric distortion , @xmath174 , followed by a body rotation , @xmath193 , about the @xmath84-axis by an angle @xmath67 is : _",
    "soft=    _ xx&&_zz    =    c&s - s & c    a&d d & b    .",
    "( with @xmath209 and @xmath210 ) .",
    "one can confirm that the rotation is : = ( - )/(_xx + _ zz ) [ tantheta ] and thus for instance for @xmath211 : = ( -  )  with ^2=(_xx + _",
    "zz)^2 + ( -)^2 .",
    "of course there is no body rotation for @xmath46 symmetric , that is @xmath212 .",
    "one can also confirm that the symmetric shear tensor is : = (    _ xx(_zz + _ xx)- (-  ) & _ xx+_zz _ xx+_zz & _ zz(_zz + _ xx ) + ( -  )    ) .",
    "[ symdecomp ]    the results ( [ tantheta ] ) and ( [ symdecomp ] ) break the soft modes down into a symmetric shear @xmath174 followed by a body rotation @xmath193 through an angle @xmath67 about the @xmath84-axis .",
    "thus the soft mode is @xmath213 .",
    "we continue to parameterise them with the director rotation @xmath97 .",
    "the body rotation is through an angle @xmath67 given by & = & + & = & [ rotalpha ] .    for small shear ( small director rotation @xmath97 ) ,",
    "the component of body rotation is small too and proportional to @xmath97 : .[alphasmalltheta ] for large rotations , @xmath214 , the rotation @xmath67 vanishes as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ softstrains_b ] .",
    "thus it is only at first that body rotation plays a part in accommodating the rotating chains . as the rotation of chains approaches @xmath120 , the body is simply extended or compressed along the principal axes of the original chain distribution .    the corresponding symmetric shear strain @xmath215 , the off - diagonal component of @xmath216 , is d = which , for small distortions is also proportional to @xmath97 , bearing in mind that @xmath217 is constant at first order in @xmath97 : d = . [ dsmalltheta ]    as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ softstrains_b ] , it also vanishes at @xmath218 , where no further accommodation of the shape tensor by rotation is possible . in fig .",
    "[ symrot ] , we show the rotation and off - diagonal element of the symmetric shear occurring during soft deformations between @xmath219 and @xmath157 .    notice that both quantities are linear in @xmath97 for small distortions . as the director of the chain distributions",
    "is rotated beyond @xmath120 , the solid body rotation @xmath67 and the off - diagonal element of the shear @xmath215 become negative . at a director rotation of @xmath157 ,",
    "the original body shape is recovered , as it should be in an uniaxial nematic system under reflection of the director @xmath220 .",
    "similarly , the behaviour of the pure shear is instructive : for this purpose , we plot in fig . [ eigen ]",
    "the two eigenvalues of @xmath221 , which serve as a good measure of the net presence of shear .",
    "note that , due to incompressibility , the product of the two eigenvalues is constant to 1 .",
    "both eigenvalues are linear for small @xmath97 , saturate at values @xmath124 and @xmath222 respectively for a director rotation of @xmath120 , where the soft mode becomes a simple compression and extension along the principal axes . at a rotation of @xmath157",
    ", we recover the eigenvalues of the identity matrix .",
    "> from equation ( [ parasoft2 ] ) , we see that the compression and extension in the @xmath79 and @xmath84 directions are quadratic in @xmath97 for small director rotations . in other words ,",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath112 too are proportional to @xmath223 ( by equations ( [ dsmalltheta ] ) and ( [ alphasmalltheta ] ) ) .",
    "soft deformations of nematic elastomers result from the rotation of the anisotropic chain shape distribution without distortion and therefore without rubber elastic free energy cost .",
    "this is by contrast to classical rubber , where distorsion of the distribution lowers entropy and raises the free energy .",
    "explicit forms of these soft modes are derived in the case of biaxial nematic elastomers using the olmsted method of the square roots of tensors developed for the uniaxial case . for both cases",
    "we show geometrically what these deformations look like .",
    "they correspond to rotations of prolate distributions being accommodated by elastic strains of the body they are inscribed into .",
    "the elasticity of nematic elastomers depends , unlike in classical elastomers , on body rotations ( since these can be with respect to the underlying nematic director ) . at finite strains it is important to isolate the rotational component of the generally non - symmetric deformations .",
    "we make contact with the polar decomposition theorem in this context . in doing",
    "so we discuss the roots of tensors that are employed in finding the manifold of soft deformation tensors .",
