    "over the past decade , the hubble space telescope ( ) and modern giant telescopes have opened a new era in observational cosmology .",
    "galaxies are now routinely found in the very early universe , and their evolution can be followed from its early stages to the present . particularly , deep multi - wavelength imaging surveys have been established as a powerful and efficient tool to push observations up to high redshift and down to faint populations of galaxies .",
    "these modern surveys have revealed a complex interplay between galaxy mergers , star formation , and black holes over cosmic time and have led to new insights into the physical processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution .    of the entire cosmic time ,",
    "two epochs are particularly of great interest : z@xmath32 ( cosmic high noon ) and z@xmath38 ( cosmic dawn ) . in the former ,",
    "the cosmic star formation history reached its peak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and galaxies quickly assembled their stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as began to differentiate into morphological sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the latter , detection and physical properties of galaxies place essential constraints on the reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the accretion history of galaxies at early times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the formation of metals and dust in the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because two important spectral features , namely , the balmer break at z@xmath32 and the lyman break at z@xmath38 , are redshifted to near - infrared ( nir ) bands at the two epochs , a nir survey with deep sensitivity and high spatial resolution is required for robust investigation of galaxies during these epochs . incorporating these deep nir data into a multi - wavelength catalog would significantly improve measurements of galaxy properties at z@xmath52 .    the cosmic assembly",
    "near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is designed to document galaxy formation and evolution over the redshift range of z=1.58 .",
    "the core of candels is to use the revolutionary near - infrared /wfc3 camera , installed on hubble in may 2009 , to obtain deep imaging of faint and faraway objects .",
    "candels also uses /acs to carry out parallel observations , aiming to providing unprecedented panchromatic coverage of galaxies from optical wavelengths to the near - ir .",
    "covering approximately 800 @xmath6 , candels will image over 250,000 distant galaxies within five popular sky regions which possess rich existing data from multiple telescopes and instruments : goods - s , goods - n , uds , egs , and cosmos .",
    "the strategy of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of @xmath7 to z@xmath32 , and around the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z@xmath38 .",
    "it will also find and measure type ia supernovae at z@xmath51.5 to test their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology .",
    "the goods - s field , centered at @xmath8(j2000 ) = 03h32m30s and @xmath9(j2000 ) = -27d48m20s and located within the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is a sky region of about 170 arcmin@xmath10 which has been targeted for some of the deepest observations ever taken by nasa s great observatories : , , and  as well as by other world - class telescopes .",
    "the field has been imaged in the optical wavelength with /acs in f435w , f606w , f775w , and f850lp bands as part of the  treasury program : the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in the mid - ir ( 3.624 @xmath1 m ) wavelength with  as part of the goods  legacy program ( pi : m. dickinson ) ; and in the x - ray with the deepest  sky survey ever taken , with a total integration time of 4 ms @xcite .",
    "the field also has very deep far - ir to submillimeter data from _ herschel _ space observatory from the pep survey @xcite and the hermes survey @xcite , deep submillimeter ( 1.1 mm ) observation with aztec / aste @xcite , and radio imaging from the vla @xcite , atca @xcite , and vlba @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the field has been the subject of numerous spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these rich and deep existing data , covering the full wavelength range , make goods - s one of the best fields to study galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this paper presents a multi - wavelength catalog of goods - s based on candels wfc3 f160w detection , combining both candels data and available public imaging data from uv to mid - ir wavelength .",
    "the catalog includes u - band images obtained with the ctio blanco telescope and with the visible multi - object spectrograph ( vimos ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) , /acs images in f435w , f606w , f775w , f814w , and f850lp bands , /wfc3 images in f098 m , f105w , f125w , and f160w bands , ks - band image with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) and the high acuity wide field k - band imager ( hawk - i ) on the vlt , as well as  images at 3.5 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "2 briefly summarizes the datasets included in our catalog .",
    "3 discusses source detection in the candels f160w image and photometry measurement on  images .",
    "4 discusses photometry measurements on low resolution images .",
    "5 evaluates the quality of our photometry catalog .",
    "6 presents a few simple applications of our catalog to study galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the summary is given in sec .",
    "all magnitudes in the paper are on the ab scale @xcite unless otherwise noted .",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath11 cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and use the hubble constant in terms of @xmath14 .",
    "the candels goods - s multi - wavelength catalog and its associated files  all sextractor photometry of the  bands as well as the system throughput of all included filters  are made publicly available on the candels website , in the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , via the on - line version of the article , and the centre de donnees astronomiques de strasbourg ( cds ) .",
    "they are also available in the rainbow database @xcite , which features a query menu that allows users to search for individual galaxies , create subsets of the complete sample based on different criteria , and inspect cutouts of the galaxies in any of the available bands .",
    "it also includes a cross - matching tool to compare against user uploaded catalogs .",
    "table [ tb : band ] summarizes the multi - wavelength datasets included in our catalog .",
    "the table lists the effective wavelength , the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the filter , the fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) , and the limiting magnitude of each band in our catalog . for each band , we calculate the 5@xmath0 limiting magnitude with an aperture whose radius is equal to the fwhm of the band . no aperture correction is applied to the limiting magnitude .",
    "transmission curves of all filters used in our catalog are plotted in figure [ fig : filter ] .",
    "the sky coverage of observations used in our catalog is shown in figure [ fig : map ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we present a uv - to - mid infrared multi - wavelength catalog in the candels / goods - s region , combining the newly obtained candels /wfc3 f105w , f125w , and f160w data with existing public data .",
    "the catalog is based on source detection in the wfc3 f160w band . to maximize the scientific yields of our catalog , we construct a `` max - depth '' f160w mosaic , which includes data from the candels deep and wide observations as well as two previous /wfc3 programs , ers and hudf09 .",
    "the f160w mosaic , providing the deepest photometry for each individual source in goods - s , reaches a 5@xmath0 limiting depth ( within an aperture of 017 , the fwhm of the f160w ) of 27.4 , 28.2 , and 29.7 ab mag for candels wide , deep + ers , and hudf regions , respectively .",
    "the representative 50% completeness of our catalog reaches 25.9 , 26.6 , and 28.1 ab mag in the f160w band for the three regions .",
    "the catalog contains 34930 sources in total .",
    "in addition to wfc3 nir bands , the catalog also includes data from uv ( u - band from both ctio / mosaic and vlt / vimos ) , optical ( goods /acs f435w , f606w , f775w , f814w , and f850lp ) , and ir ( ers wfc3 f098 m , vlt / isaac ks , vlt / hawk - i ks , and spitzer / irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 @xmath1 m ) observations .",
    "we use sextractor to measure photometry for all available  bands from psf matched images . for other low - resolution bands ,",
    "whose fwhms of psfs vary by almost a factor of 10 , we use our profile template fitting package , tfit , to measure the uniform photometry among them .",
    "the quality of the multi - wavelength catalog is thoroughly tested .",
    "first , the comparison between the acs  wfc3 colors of stars in our catalog and those of stars in synthetic stellar libraries shows excellent agreements .",
    "second , the difference of photometry between our catalog and goods - music and fireworks is nearly zero over the magnitude range to @xmath324 ab mag , with the worst offset being @xmath30.05 mag .",
    "we discuss the possible reasons of the deviations between our and other catalogs at the faint end .",
    "last , the zeropoint offsets measured by comparing the observed seds to the best - fit stellar population synthesis templates of spectroscopically observed galaxies are @xmath150.02 mag for most uv - to - nir bands .",
    "the photo - zs measured with our catalog can reach the accuracy of nmad@xmath30.028 .",
    "our catalog is able to detect star - forming galaxies with stellar mass of @xmath16 to z@xmath33.4 , 4.6 , and 8.0 at a 50% completeness in the wide , deep , and ultra - deep regions , respectively .",
    "passive galaxies with the same stellar mass can be detected at a 50% completeness to z@xmath32.8 , 3.2 , and 4.2 in above regions .",
    "our catalog in the wide and deep regions is about 12 mag deeper than other public h - band surveys .",
    "the minimum detectable stellar mass in the wide and deep regions of our catalog is therefore smaller than that of other h - band surveys by a factor of about 36 .",
    "to provide an example of applying our catalog to study distant galaxies , we use color criteria to select both star - forming and passively evolving galaxies at z=24 through the strength and curvature of the balmer break .",
    "we examine the redshift distribution of selected galaxies and discuss the effectiveness and contamination of the selection criteria .",
    "the detection of red galaxies with obvious balmer break in our catalog suggests the existence of passive galaxies at z@xmath53 .",
    "we also study the evolution of the rest - frame color  magnitude diagram , ( u - v ) vs. @xmath17 , from z=0 to z=4 to investigate the emergence of the color bimodality in the universe . a handful of red galaxies , possibly a combination of passive galaxies and dusty star - forming galaxies ,",
    "are detected in our catalog at z@xmath34 .",
