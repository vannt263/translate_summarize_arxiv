    "groupoids are mathematical structures able to describe symmetry properties more general than those described by groups .",
    "they were introduced ( and named ) by h.  brandt @xcite in 1926 .",
    "the reader will find a general presentation of that important concept in @xcite and @xcite .    a groupoid with a topological structure ( resp .",
    ", a differtiable structure ) is called a _ topological groupoid _ ( resp . , a _ lie groupoid _ ) . around 1950 ,",
    "charles ehresmann @xcite used these concepts as essential tools in topology and differential geometry .    in recent years",
    ", mickael karasev @xcite , alan weinstein @xcite and stanisaw zakrzewski @xcite independently discovered that lie groupoids equipped with a symplectic structure can be used for the construction of noncommutative deformations of the algebra of smooth functions on a manifold , with potential applications to quantization .",
    "poisson groupoids were introduced by alan weinstein @xcite as generalizations of both poisson lie groups and symplectic groupoids .",
    "the infinitesimal counterpart of the notion of a lie groupoid is the notion of a lie algebroid , in the same way as the infinitesimal counterpart of the notion of a lie group is the notion of a lie algebra .",
    "lie algebroids were first considered by jean pradines @xcite .",
    "lie groupoids and lie algebroids are now an active domain of research , with applications in various parts of mathematics @xcite . more specifically ,",
    "lie algebroids have applications in mechanics @xcite and provide a very natural setting in which one can develop the theory of differential operators such as the exterior derivative of forms and the lie derivative with respect to a vector field .",
    "in such a setting , slightly more general than that of the tangent and cotangent bundles to a smooth manifold and their exterior powers , the theory of lie derivatives extends , in a very natural way , into the theory of the schouten - nijenhuis bracket ( first introduced in differential geometry by j.a .",
    "schouten @xcite and developed by a.  nijenhuis @xcite ) .",
    "other bidifferential operators such as the bracket of exterior forms on a poisson manifold , first discovered for pfaff forms by f.  magri and c.  morosi @xcite and extended to forms of all degrees by j .-",
    "koszul @xcite appear in such a setting as very natural : they are schouten - nijenhuis brackets for the lie algebroid structure of the cotangent bundle to a poisson manifold .",
    "we first present in this paper the basic concepts related to lie groupoids and lie algebroids .",
    "then we develop the theory of lie derivatives , schouten - nijenhuis brackets and exterior derivatives in the general setting of a lie algebroid , its dual bundle and their exterior powers .",
    "all the results ( which , for their most part , are already known , see for example @xcite ) are given with detailed proofs .",
    "most of these proofs are the same as the classical ones ( when the lie algebroid is the tangent bundle to a smooth manifold ) ; a few ones are slightly more complicated because , contrary to the algebra of exterior differential forms on a manifold , the algebra of sections of exterior powers of the dual of a lie algebroid is not locally generated by its elements of degree @xmath1 and their differentials .",
    "these results may even be extended for more general algebroids with no assumption of skew - symmetry @xcite , but here we will not discuss these generalizations , nor will we discuss the schouten bracket for symmetric tensors . in the final section ,",
    "the results are applied to poisson manifolds .",
    "we show that the cotangent space of a poisson manifold has a lie algebroid structure and that the total space of the vector bundle dual to a lie algebroid has a natural poisson structure , and we use these properties for lifting to the tangent bundle poisson structures and lie algebroid structures .",
    "before stating the formal definition of a groupoid , let us explain , in an informal way , why it is a very natural concept .",
    "the easiest way to understand that concept is to think of two sets , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the first one , @xmath2 , is called the _ set of arrows _ or _ total space _ of the groupoid , and the other one , @xmath3 , the _ set of objects _ or _ set of units _ of the groupoid",
    ". one may think of an element @xmath4 as an arrow going from an object ( a point in @xmath3 ) to another object ( another point in @xmath3 ) .",
    "the word arrow  is used here in a very general sense : it means a way for going from a point in @xmath3 to another point in @xmath3 .",
    "one should not think of an arrow as a line drawn in the set @xmath3 joining the starting point of the arrow to its end point .",
    "rather , one should think of an arrow as living outside @xmath3 , with only its starting point and its end point in @xmath3 , as shown on figure  1 .     and @xmath5 , with the target of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , equal to the source of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the composed arrow @xmath10 .",
    "]    the following ingredients enter the definition of a groupoid .",
    "\\(i ) two maps @xmath11 and @xmath12 , called the _ source map _ and the _ target map _ of the groupoid .",
    "if @xmath13 is an arrow , @xmath9 is its starting point and @xmath14 its end point .",
    "\\(ii ) a _ composition law _ on the set of arrows ; we can compose an arrow @xmath6 with another arrow @xmath8 , and get an arrow @xmath10 , by following first the arrow @xmath6 , then the arrow @xmath8 . of course",
    ", @xmath10 is defined if and only if the target of @xmath6 is equal to the source of @xmath8 .",
    "the source of @xmath10 is equal to the source of @xmath6 , and its target is equal to the target of @xmath8 , as illustrated on figure  1 .",
    "it is only by convention that we write @xmath10 rather than @xmath15 : the arrow which is followed first is on the right , by analogy with the usual notation @xmath16 for the composition of two maps @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the composition of arrows is associative .",
    "\\(iii ) an _ embedding",
    "_ @xmath19 of the set @xmath3 into the set @xmath2 , which associates a unit arrow @xmath20 with each @xmath21 .",
    "that unit arrow is such that both its source and its target are @xmath22 , and it plays the role of a unit when composed with another arrow , either on the right or on the left : for any arrow @xmath8 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "\\(iv ) finally , an _ inverse map _ @xmath25 from the set of arrows onto itself . if @xmath13 is an arrow , one may think of @xmath26 as the arrow @xmath8 followed in the reverse sense .",
    "now we are ready to state the formal definition of a groupoid .",
    "a _ groupoid _ is a pair of sets @xmath27 equipped with the structure defined by the following data :    \\(i ) an injective map @xmath28 , called the _ unit section _ of the groupoid ;    \\(ii ) two maps @xmath11 and @xmath29 , called , respectively , the _ source map _ and the _ target map _ ; they satisfy @xmath30",
    "\\(iii ) a composition law @xmath31 , called the _ product _ , defined on the subset @xmath32 of @xmath33 , called the _ set of composable elements _ ,",
    "@xmath34 which is associative , in the sense that whenever one side of the equality @xmath35 is defined , the other side is defined too , and the equality holds ; moreover , the composition law @xmath36 is such that for each @xmath13 , @xmath37    \\(iv ) a map @xmath38 , called the _ inverse _ , such that , for every @xmath13 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41    the sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 are called , respectively , the _ total space _ and the _ set of units _ of the groupoid , which is itself denoted by @xmath42 .    the definition of a groupoid can be stated very briefly in the language of category theory : a _ groupoid _ is a small category all of whose arrows are invertible .",
    "we recall that a category is said to be _ small _ if the collections of its arrows and of its objects are sets .      in what follows , by means of the injective map @xmath19",
    ", we will identify the set of units @xmath3 with the subset @xmath43 of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore @xmath19 will be the canonical injection in @xmath2 of its subset @xmath3 .    for @xmath8 and @xmath5",
    ", we will sometimes write @xmath44 , @xmath45 , or even simply @xmath46 for @xmath10 , and @xmath47 for @xmath26 .",
    "also we will write the groupoid @xmath2  for the groupoid @xmath48 .",
    "the above definition has the following consequences .",
    "the inverse map @xmath25 is involutive : @xmath49 we have indeed , for any @xmath13 , @xmath50      let @xmath8 and @xmath51 be such that @xmath52 then we have @xmath53 therefore for any @xmath54 , the unique @xmath5 such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 is @xmath26 .",
    "the target map @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "the source map @xmath58 ) of a groupoid @xmath42 determines an equivalence relation on @xmath2 : two elements @xmath8 and @xmath5 are said to be @xmath57-equivalent ( resp .",
    "@xmath58-equivalent ) if @xmath59 ( resp .",
    "if @xmath60 ) .",
    "the corresponding equivalence classes are called the _ @xmath57-fibres _ ( resp .",
    "the _ @xmath58-fibres _ ) of the groupoid .",
    "they are of the form @xmath61 ( resp .",
    "@xmath62 ) , with @xmath21 .    for each unit @xmath21 ,",
    "the subset @xmath63 is called the _ isotropy group _ of @xmath22 .",
    "it is indeed a group , with the restrictions of @xmath36 and @xmath25 as composition law and inverse map .",
    "we have seen ( figure  1 ) a way in which groupoids may be visualized , by using arrows for elements in @xmath2 and points for elements in @xmath3 .",
    "there is another , very useful way to visualize groupoids , shown on figure  2 .",
    "the total space @xmath2 of the groupoid is represented as a plane , and the set @xmath3 of units as a straight line in that plane .",
    "the @xmath57-fibres ( resp .",
    "the @xmath58-fibres ) are represented as parallel straight lines , transverse to @xmath3 .",
    "such a visualization should be used with care : one may think , at first sight , that there is only one element in the groupoid with a given source and a given target , which is not true in general .",
    "let @xmath64 be a nonempty set .",
    "let @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 be the projection on the right factor @xmath68 , @xmath69 the projection on the left factor @xmath70 , @xmath71 be the diagonal map @xmath72 .",
    "we define the composition law @xmath73 and the inverse @xmath74 by @xmath75 then @xmath76 is a groupoid , called the _ groupoid of pairs _ of elements in @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath64 be a nonempty set with an equivalence relation @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath66 . the source and target maps @xmath58 and @xmath57 are the restrictions to @xmath2 of the source and target maps , above defined on @xmath79 for the groupoid of pairs .",
    "the composition law @xmath36 , the injective map @xmath19 and the inverse @xmath25 , are the same as for th egroupoid of pairs , suitably restricted .",
    "then @xmath80 is a groupoid , more precisely a subgroupoid of the groupoid of pairs of elements in e.    this example shows that equivalence relations may be considered as special groupoids .",
    "conversely , on the set of units @xmath3 of a general groupoid @xmath42 , there is a natural equivalence relation : @xmath81 and @xmath82 are said to be equivalent if there exists @xmath13 such that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "but the groupoid structure generally carries more information than that equivalence relation : there may be several @xmath4 such that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , _ i.e. _ , several ways in which @xmath81 and @xmath85 are equivalent .",
