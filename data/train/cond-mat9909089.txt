    "the question of the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter arose very soon after the discovery of high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) .",
    "different symmetries imply superconductivity of considerably different properties and large efforts have been devoted to determining the type of pairing in different materials .",
    "experimental findings have yielded ambiguous results , yet they strongly suggest explanations extending beyond the simplest @xmath2-wave picture , possibly @xmath0-wave or mixed state in cuprate hts . recently , the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tri - cristal josephson effect@xcite revealed a large @xmath0-wave component in the order parameter of cuprate superconductors .",
    "apart from different pairing mechanisms favoring this kind of pairing , this situation may be due to kinetic mechanisms , as suggested by blaer et al@xcite .",
    "with inclusion of the nnn hopping , a bound pair formed on adjacent lattice sites can propagate over long distances before decaying .",
    "the effective mass of such a pair can become even smaller than the mass of its constituent fermions .",
    "the issue of nnn hopping has also important implications for the problem of hole motion in an antiferromagnetic background @xcite and for the explanation of the hts properties @xcite@xcite .",
    "exactly solvable model of two fermions on a periodic lattice would give a valuable insight into the problems of both : the role of nnn hopping and the symmetry of the superconducting state .",
    "it is also of importance , as a limiting case for the two relevant models of superconductivity : bcs and preformed pairs scenario .    in this paper",
    "we report results of exact calculations of bound states ( bs ) of fermions on a 2d square lattice including nnn hopping and nnn interactions , using formulation of ref .",
    "we have evaluated the pair binding energies , pair mobilities and dispersion curves across the brillouin zone for the extended hubbard model for different pairing symmetries .",
    "we discuss in detail the effect of nnn hopping @xmath3 and nnn interactions @xmath4 , on the stability of the shallow bs .",
    "the details of the theoretical treatment are given in @xcite so we shall give here only the main points .",

    "in figs ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) we have plotted the binding energies and mobilities vs @xmath97 for extended-@xmath2 pairing ( denoted as @xmath63 ) and for @xmath65-wave pairing ( in short @xmath0 ) , for nnn hopping with parameter @xmath95 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the last two values roughly correspond to the values of the parameter @xmath100 , suggested by the band structure calculations in @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) @xcite .    with only the nn hopping taken into account ( i.e. @xmath95 ) for @xmath91 infinitesimally small value of @xmath105 can create a bound state ( of the @xmath63 type )",
    " there is no critical value . for finite @xmath106 or @xmath4 ,",
    "including the case of the infinite on - site repulsion , @xmath105 has to reach critical value to create such a bound state ( @xmath107 for @xmath63-wave for @xmath108 for @xmath95 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-wave pairing does not depend on @xmath106 , and also a critical value of @xmath109 ( or @xmath110 in the case of @xmath67 ) has to be reached to form a pair of the @xmath0 type . in this case",
    "( @xmath95 ) , the binding energies of @xmath0 type are smaller than the @xmath2-wave binding energies in the whole range of displayed parameters . the mobility of pairs is smaller then 1 ( i.e. the effective mass of a pair is larger then the mass of its constituent fermions ) and decreases with increasing intersite attraction .",
    "increasing @xmath105 makes the binding stronger , but at the same time , the pair movement more difficult",
    ". the mobility increases with decreasing @xmath105 for @xmath95 , and is always smaller for @xmath0-wave than @xmath2-wave .",
    "let us note , that the mobility of the @xmath63-pairs for @xmath108 becomes larger than the mobility of the @xmath63-pairs for @xmath91 near the critical value of @xmath111 .",
    "it is so , despite the fact , that the binding energies for @xmath108 are smaller than in the @xmath91 case .",
    "it is also of interest , that both mobility and binding energies of the @xmath63-pairs for @xmath112 resemble the respective quantities of the @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "differences appear near the critical value , which is slightly smaller in the @xmath63 case , with @xmath63 mobility there about twice as large as in the @xmath0 case , but they diminish very quickly with increasing @xmath105 .",
    "the situation changes rapidly with increasing @xmath3 ( which is taken with the opposite sign than @xmath113 ) .",
    "the binding energy of @xmath0-wave pairs grows and can become larger than that of @xmath2-wave pairs for large enough @xmath105 .",
    "the same happens for the mobilities . for the @xmath0-wave",
    ", the mobility grows faster than @xmath2-wave and for large enough @xmath105 ( although not the same as for pair binding energies ) the mobility of @xmath0-pairs exceeds that of @xmath2-pairs .",
    "starting from @xmath114 the pair mobilities can become greater than 1 and even strongly bound pair can easily move without breaking its bond . for @xmath115 , @xmath116 with @xmath117(@xmath118 ) for @xmath0 ( @xmath63 ) -wave pairs , respectively@xcite .",
    "the increase of pair mobilities with the parameter @xmath119 is much more abrupt for @xmath0-wave pairing than for @xmath2-wave , so at the value @xmath99 the maximum of @xmath0-pairs mobility is around 6 while that of @xmath2-pairs around 4 , and the mobility for @xmath2-wave is smaller than for @xmath0-wave in the whole range of displayed @xmath111 values ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    with growing @xmath119",
    "a new feature develops : a maximum appears in the mobility curves .",
    "the mobility generally increases with @xmath100 and decreases with @xmath105 but is not the largest for the critical value of @xmath111 . for @xmath63-wave pairing with @xmath91",
    "the mobility for @xmath120 is always equal to the mass of two free fermions , i.e. 1 in our units . for small binding energies ,",
    "the mobility increases with @xmath105 and diminishes only later , for still larger @xmath105 , which creates a maximum .",
    "this is a consequence of the saddle points located at @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the reciprocal space .",
    "the dispersion curves are anomalously flat in that region ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "5 ) , particles move slower and the probability of pairing increases .",
    "the singularity is only `` felt '' by the shallow states , which results in a maximum for small @xmath105 .",
    "we note that for large enough @xmath105 the mobility of @xmath63 bound pairs becomes negative , which is connected to the fact that the minimum of bs energy moves from @xmath123 towards @xmath124 .    in figs ( 4 ) and ( 5 )",
    "we show the bound state dispersion curves across the brillouin zone for @xmath92 .",
    "the bs energies of @xmath0- and @xmath63- pairing are the same at the zone boundary . at the @xmath125 point",
    "@xmath0-wave bs energy is larger or smaller than @xmath2-wave bs energy , depending on @xmath100 and @xmath105 .",
    "the @xmath0-wave bs energies can be larger than @xmath2-wave ones in a part of the b. z. and smaller in another part of the b. z. and the possibility of mixed @xmath1 state emerges .    in fig .",
    "( 5 ) we plotted the dispersion curves along the lines @xmath126 for @xmath99 .",
    "we observe a mixing of @xmath63 and @xmath0 wave states and well developed dispersion for deep bound states .",
    "calculations for small binding energies show , however , that shallow bound states may exist only in parts of the b.z .",
    "we were unable to to find bound states in the domain of real energies near the @xmath127 point for small @xmath105 ( both in the case of @xmath63- and @xmath0-wave pairing ) .",
    "there is a possibility that bs enter the scattering continuum and turn into resonance states .",
    "the problem of the resonance states is left for further study .",
    "( 6 ) shows the ground state diagram for the shallow bound states .",
    "the nnn interaction @xmath4 was assumed to be positive , i.e. we disregarded @xmath67 pairing .",
    "the resulting curves show , that for nn hopping @xmath63-wave pairing prevails even for the infinite nnn repulsion .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath3 together with the on - site repulsion act in favour of @xmath0-wave pairing . for a given @xmath106",
    ", a finite @xmath4 is needed to get the ground state of @xmath0-wave symmetry .    finally , let us point out that our results for existence of two - body bs in the @xmath2-wave channel are directly related to the stability of @xmath2-wave superconductivity on 2d lattice in a dilute limit  @xcite .",
    "we have examined two - electron bound states in an extended hubbard model with nnn hopping and nnn interaction .",
    "the analysis shows that @xmath3 affects kinetic energy of pairs in a considerable way .",
    "this second hopping , with opposite sign to @xmath113 , enhances @xmath0-wave pairing more than @xmath2 * -wave .",
    "the nnn hopping increases the relative pair mobility , which can become greater than that of free fermions ( and a possibility of long - lived higly mobile bound pairs arises ) , in agreement with @xcite .",
