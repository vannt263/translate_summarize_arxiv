    "the orbital decay of massive black hole pairs from galactic scale separations to distances at which gravitational wave ( gw ) emission takes over is governed by a number of different physical mechanisms .",
    "in particular the decay has a different nature in a predominantly gaseous background as opposed to a predominantly stellar background .",
    "these two regimes are usually studied separately , although galactic nuclei in a galaxy host might transition from one regime to the other even multiple times in their evolution as a result of galaxy mergers , starvation of cosmological gas accretion , disk instabilities , and any process that can significantly affect the gas supply and star formation rate in galactic nuclei .",
    "the last decade has seen significant improvements in the realism of the numerical models dedicated to tackle one or the other regime , and even the first attempts to model both regimes in the same calculation ( khan et al .",
    "2013a ) .",
    "two important general results can be drawn from the studies of the last few years .",
    "first , it is now largely agreed that the last parsec problem that once plagued the stellar background calculations does not exist in a realistic galaxy host , namely one with a triaxial , rotating stellar distribution ( berczik et al .",
    "2006;khan et al . 2011;2012;2013b",
    "; vasiliev , antonini & merritt 2015 ) .",
    "one of the most convincing demonstrations comes from a recent analysis of orbital diffusion in the loss cone using different types of potentials , including triaxial ones , with increasing number of particles in collisionless simulations ( gualandris et al .",
    "loss cone refilling thus appears to be effective enough in realistic galaxy hosts , allowing a successful hardening via 3-body encounters down to separations at which gravitational waves take over .",
    "recently cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have confirmed that realistic merger remnants , in which gas dissipation and star formation takes place , do possess the required degree of triaxiality to keep the loss cone nearly full and drive coalescence ( khan et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the second result is that the decay in a gaseous background , once believed to be much faster than in a stellar background ( eg escala et al .",
    "2005 ; dotti , colpi & haardt 2006 ; mayer et al .",
    "2007 ) , turned out to be a much more complex problem than initially suspected , with the consequence that there is no simple general scenario at the moment . at variance with the stellar background case ,",
    "in which dynamical fiction and 3-body encounters are well defined and well understood sources of drag , in gaseous backgrounds different types of torques can dominate at different scales and in different stages of the orbital evolution , such as dynamical friction , linear and nonlinear torques from a background circumnuclear rotating disk ( cnd ) , stochastic torques from massive clouds / clumps and large - amplitude spiral density waves , and tidal torques by circumbinary disks at the smallest separations ( see eg mayer 2013 , roedig et al . 2012 ; farris et al 2015 ) . the stochastic torque regime due to perturbations in an inhomogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) , in particular , was pointed out only recently , and can delay or shorten orbital decay by orders of magnitude relative to the smooth disk case ( fiacconi et al . 2013 ; mayer 2013 ) . finally , even in the simple case of a smooth cnd there are indications that the orbital decay may stall , or at least slow down significantly , once the separations of the two holes drops below a tenth of a parsec ( mayer et al . 2008 ; chapon et al .",
    "2013 ) .    as a result of the multiple regimes and physical parameters of galactic nuclei that can affect orbital decay , it is fair to say that black hole merger timescales are really uncertain overall , with values ranging from as small as 10 myr ( eg khan et al .",
    "2016 ) to as large as a few billion years ( khan et al .",
    "2011;2012 ) depending on the specific regime and physical conditions considered .",
    "indeed in this article we focus on this pivotal issue of timescales as it is highly relevant to define the science that will be possible with lisa .",
    "in the last few years a number of works , both numerical and semi - numerical , have provided evidence that there is no last - parsec problem in realistic galactic potentials , where non - axisymmetry and some degree of rotation are always present ( berczik et al .",
    "2006 ; vasiliev , antonini & merritt 2015 ; khan et al . 2013b",
    "; holley - bockelmann & khan 2015 ) .",
    "although convergence of the hardening rates is not yet demonstrated in collisional n - body simulations ( but see holley - bockelmann & khan 2015 on highly rotating systems ) , alternative approaches such as the numerical convergence study of orbital diffusion in the loss cone using collisionless n - body simulations ( gualandris et al .",
    "2016 ) strongly support the notion that the loss cone should remain nearly full in realistic galaxy merger remnants .",
    "this in turn yields confidence in the results of collisional n - body simulations of black hole binary hardening in galaxy mergers at the currently affordable resolutions ( less than @xmath5 particles , see eg khan et al .",
    "2012 ; holley - bockelmann & khan 2015 ) .    on the left",
    "we show a grey - scale luminosity map ( in the uvj filter ) from the argo cosmological simulation showing the galaxy merger that was selected and re - simulated at much higher resolution ( green circles ) .",
    "the white circle marks the virial radius of the group - sized halo , while the green circles mark the merging galaxies . from the spatial scale",
    "it is clear how the galaxies at study , which have stellar masses almost as large as those of our present - day milky way ( @xmath6 ) have sizes below 1 kpc , hence 4 - 5 times smaller than our milky way .",
    "this is expected based on the scaling arguments described in the text . on the right",
    "we show the complete orbital separation curve for the two massive black holes at the center of the re - simulated merger with pc scale resolution , ending with the in - spiral driven by gw emission ( green dashed line ar 32 myr ) .",
    "we plot also the results of simulations without the direct n - body integration , that captures the hardening phase , as well as with direct n - body but without the post - newtonian corrections ( blanchet 2006 ) , which are relevant in the very last phase .",
    "we refer to khan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) for details . ]",
    "the latter simulations find that massive black hole binaries can merge on timescales shorter than an hubble time .",
    "a particularly successful case is that of ultramassive black holes in stellar dominated hosts , for which dynamical friction is so effective to bring them all the way to the gravitational wave emission phase without the need of a long hardening stage ( khan & holley - bockelmann 2015 ) .",
    "however , with this last exception , all published timescales are really long , ranging from slightly below 1 to a few gyr , namely they encompass a significant fraction of the hubble time .",
    "note that the latter result is consistent with the simple analytical predictions of gould & rix ( 2000 ) , which were assuming efficient loss cone refilling in a potential with the properties of present - day spheroids .",
    "n - body simulations mostly consider black holes at the high mass end , @xmath7 , hence the coalescence timescale for lisa black holes , which are much lighter , would be even longer , assuming the same properties of the ( stellar ) background hold . if merging timescales of a few gyr are the norm at any redshift , the consequence would be that black hole mergers would be exceedingly rare at @xmath8 since the lookback time is a less than 3 gyr then",
    ". this would be unfortunate since this is also the epoch for which the discovery potential of lisa is very high .",
    "the inefficient coalescence in stellar backgrounds has been and still is the motivation behind exploring the alternative regime in which orbital decay is driven by gasdynamical processes .",
    "however , as we will illustrate in section 3 , coalescence does not become necessarily faster in gaseous backgrounds .",
    "therefore it is fair to say we are facing a _ timescale problem _ rather than a _",
    "last parsec problem_. we ought to make progress in order to obtain robust forecasts black hole coalescence rates in the lisa band .",
    "uncertainties in the black hole seeding models would also generate important variations in the expected event rates ( sesana , volonteri & haardt 2007 ) . yet",
    "black hole seeding models tend to yield different black hole population properties only at at very high redshift , while afterwards the physics of black hole growth via gas accretion and mergers with other black holes become the dominant driver of the evolution of the black hole mass function ( @xmath9 , see eg volonteri & natarajan 2009 ; bonoli et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "sesana & khan ( 2015 ) have pointed out that the hardening timescale is determined by the longest decay phase at sub - pc separations .",
    "this is the phase associated with the transition between dominance of 3-body encounters and dominance of energy loss by gravitational wave emission .",
    "the two processes have indeed rates proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , where @xmath12 is the semi - major axis ( hereafter separation ) of the binary . by defining a characteristic separation @xmath13",
    "at which the hardening rate by 3-body encounters and the hardening rate by gravitational wave emission are equal one obtains the lifetime of the binary at sub - pc scales as that corresponds to the orbital decay time in the longest phase of the decay .",
    "following sesana & khan ( 2015 ) .",
    "for the latter characteristic decay timescale one finds :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the characteristic stellar density and mean ( 1d ) stellar velocity dispersion in the galactic nucleus , @xmath17 is an adimensional parameter expressing how close the loss cone is to full ( @xmath18 for a full loss cone , @xmath19 for triaxial systems employed in numerical simulations such as in khan et al .",
    "the dependence on density and stellar velocity dispersion is linear .",
    "however this equation has no apparent connection with cosmology , although the parameters that appear in it need to be informed by cosmology in modern galaxy formation theory .",
    "elucidating such connection is the main purpose of this section .",
    "we start by recalling that in the galaxy formation scenario arising in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmic structures form bottom - up via collapse of density fluctuations combined with hierarchical merging .",
    "the characteristic density of a dark matter halo is determined by the virial overdensity @xmath20 . inside the region whose mean overdensity is the virial overdensity a halo is virialized , namely there is a well defined equlibrium structure for which the binding energy is set . in the simple spherical collapse model",
    "the virial overdensity can be calculated exactly once the cosmological parameters are known ( eg bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "often for simplicity the redshift - independent overdensity defined to be 200 times the critical density of the universe , @xmath21 , is adopted . while such overdensity is only strictly valid in a universe with matter density parameter @xmath22 , quantitative statements concerning redshift evolution of structures are very weakly dependent on the presence or not of a cosmological constant ( with corresponding density parameter @xmath23 ) until it begins to be dominant at @xmath24 .",
    "this is because the virial ovedensity varies only by factors of 2 as a function of redshift relative to @xmath21 ( bryan & norman 1998 ) . in the remainder of this section",
    "we will thus drop @xmath23 since equations are simplified considerably , and afterwards we will comment on the magnitude of the eventual corrections .    inside a virialized",
    "halo baryons would collapse and form a luminous galaxy .",
    "hence , as it is customary , one can assume that scaling relations between key galaxy structural parameters , such as mass , radius , circular velocity ( or velocity dispersion ) , and thus also characteristic density , directly reflect those of the virialized host halo because this comprises most of the mass , and therefore most of the binding energy ( white & rees 1978 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "galaxy size will depend also on the amount of angular momentum , but this is also assumed to be proportional to the angular momentum of the halo and to be approximately conserved , introducing a simple scaling factor between galaxy size and halo virial radius .",
    "the virial overdensity @xmath20 is , by definition , a multiple of the mean density of the universe at the corresponding epoch , thereby it has to increase as @xmath25 towards high redshift . with our assumption that @xmath26 we are simply enforcing that the multiplication factor is constant over time .",
    "as a consequence , _ if the characteristic density of galaxies follows the halo overdensity then it should also scale as @xmath25 .",
    "_ for instance at @xmath0 galaxies should be approximately @xmath27 times denser relative to their @xmath28 counterparts .",
    "while this is essentially textbook structure formation one should appreciate the very important implications in the context of massive black hole binary coalescence .",
    "_ indeed based in eq .",
    "( 1 ) this means that coalescence timescales can be shorter by two orders of magnitude at @xmath0 relative to @xmath28 .",
    "the latter is a significant effect .",
    "_    this simple approach neglects two aspects .",
    "the first one is that , based on the same scaling relations between halos and galaxies , also the stellar velocity dispersion , which enters in equation ( 1 ) , depends on redshift , as we will illustrate in a moment .",
    "the second one is that baryonic physics can decouple to some extent the dynamics of the baryons from that of the dark matter .",
    "hence the scaling of halo and galaxy properties is not necessarily homologous ( although cosmological hydro simulations show it is so to some degree , see eg sokolowska et al .",
    "2016 ) . indeed modern theory of galaxy formation is essentially based on the effort to try achieve the necessary decoupling suggested by observational constraints on galaxy properties via what we collectively indicate as `` feedback mechanisms '' . within the same framework ,",
    "radiative cooling is also an obvious process that tends to decouple baryons from the collisionless dark matter fluid , with a tendency to increase density beyond the the inference of the scalings just described because important coolants such as recombination and atomic radiative transitions increase their rate with increasing density .",
    "these processes will shape the mass distribution in galaxies , hence they will determine the density profile as a function of radius .",
    "we will return to this second point in section 3 but for now we can continue our reasoning as if galaxies were sufficiently described by a characteristic density , i.e. neglecting their actual mass profiles . assuming an isothermal sphere for the velocity distribution we can move on easily with our calculations .",
    "this is an oversimplification given that ( 1 ) the nfw model , that is conventionally used to describe cdm halos , is close to the isothermal law only in the intermediate region , and that ( 2 ) both halos and galaxies are not sppherical so they will possess significant orbital anisotropy . yet here we want to capture the essential notions and scalings rather than exact numbers . hence continuing with the isothermal model one can write that the 1d velocity dispersion is @xmath29 , where we impose that the ( constant ) circular velocity @xmath30 is equal to the virial velocity @xmath31 of the dark matter halo .",
    "the latter is automatically determined by the halo virial mass in dissipationless spherical collapse theory once the virial overdensity and the reference cosmological parameters are set .",
    "the virial radius is also automatically determined in the spherical collapse model as the radius containing a region with the virial overdensity , eg the radius at which the density equals @xmath21 .",
    "the relation between halo virial mass @xmath32 and virial velocity @xmath31 is ( see mo , mao & white 1998 ) :    @xmath33    the redshift dependence is contained in the hubble parameter @xmath34 which , in a generic cosmology with non - zero cosmological constant , is defined as :    @xmath35}^{1/2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the total density parameter and the cosmological constant density parameter at @xmath28 , and @xmath38 is the hubble constant . assuming @xmath39 and @xmath40 in equation ( 3 ) and substituting the result into equation ( 2 ) one obtains the following scaling of the velocity dispersion with redshift for a fixed halo virial mass @xmath32 :    @xmath41    assuming",
    "the mass of the galaxy is simply proportional to halo mass , as strongly suggested by abundance matching ( eg behroozi et al .",
    "2013 ) , this simple scaling relation can also be used for the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion as long as the galactic potential does not modify greatly the relation between velocity and mass ( which it can not if the galaxy and halo are in equilibrium ) . at @xmath0",
    "the relation implies an increase in velocity dispersion of a factor of @xmath42 relative to @xmath28 as opposed to an increase in density of more than a factor of a 100 ( see above ) .",
    "bringing the cosmological constant back in inside equation ( 3 ) would only change the result by about @xmath43 . hence ,",
    "if we assume that the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath16 is of order of the velocity dispersion of the halo , @xmath44 , we can safely state that the main effect as redshift increases is that the increasing density should shorten the hardening timescale almost as fast as the density increases , namely as @xmath45 .",
    "the previous discussion is instrumental to understand the results of recent simulation work .",
    "khan et al . (",
    "2016 ) have made the first attempt to use a a lcdm galaxy formation simulation as the initial condition to follow the evolution of a massive black hole binary into the gravitational wave emission regime .",
    "they selected the most massive pair of galaxies within the high resolution sub - volume of the cosmological zoom - in hydrodynamical simulation argo ( fiacconi & feldmann 2015 ; fiacconi , feldmann & mayer 2015 ) , having stellar masses of a few times @xmath46 in halos with @xmath47 .",
    "then they increased the resolution further in two steps using particle splitting .",
    "finally they converted into stars the very little residual gas after the major merger in order to continue the simulation as an n - body collisional calculation with post - newtonian corrections ( blanchet 2006 ) .",
    "uncertainties in baryonic processes , especially feedback , are of course present .",
    "nevertheless the galaxy merger was chosen after verifying that it produces a galaxy whose key structural parameters match the available observational constraints , such as the relation between stellar mass and halo mass and the scaling relations between galaxy effective radius and its stellar velocity dispersion ( feldmann & mayer 2015 ) . in particular , the characteristic densities and stellar velocity dispersions , which enter eq ( 1 ) , match reasonably those inferred for observed massive galaxies at high redshift ( szomoru et al . 2012 ; bezanson et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the selected merger starts at @xmath48 and is over by @xmath49 ( figure 1 , left panel ) .",
    "wave - form for the massive black hole merger simulated in khan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , assuming a luminosity distance ( 32 gpc ) corresponding to @xmath48 in the concordance lcdm cosmology .",
    "the lisa sensitivity curve is also shown in red , according to klein et al .",
    "( 2016).the merger should be detected by lisa in the last phase of the in - spiral . ]",
    "the timescale that we obtain for the coalescence after the galaxy merger is completed is surprisingly small , about 10 myr , and corresponds to the duration of the hardening phase , as the previous phase in which the two galactic cores merge by dynamical friction inside the common halo lasts only about a myr ( figure 1 , right panel ) .",
    "can we explain such a short timescale based on the scaling arguments just outlined ?",
    "the answer is yes . indeed we attempted the rescaling procedure suggested by the above equations in the non - cosmological models of khan et al .",
    "note that khan et al ( 2012 ) used dehnen models with with three different inner slopes ( with exponents -1.5 , -1 and 0.5 , respectively ) .",
    "we found that the merger remnants of models with the steeper inner slope provide a better fit to the cosmological merger remnant of khan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , which reflects the effect of gas dissipation increasing the central mass density prior to the completion of the merger .",
    "hence we first rescaled those remnants to the same mass of the khan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) cosmological merger remnant , and then rescaled the effective radius according to the expected redshift evolution so that the density was increased by a factor @xmath45 ( the original models were constructed to represent at @xmath28 galaxies ) .",
    "using the characteristic density of the rescaled models in equation ( 1 ) we obtained an hardening timescale of about 30 myr , as opposed to almost a gyr in the mergers using the original models adopted in khan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , just slightly higher than the timescale we find in the cosmological simulation .",
    "this supports the notion that density scaling with redshift is the main reason behind our short timescales as a similar result can be obtained starting with simple idealized models once these are appropriately rescaled to account for the redshift - dependent effects ( but note that we did not scale velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the very central density and stellar velocity dispersion are the product of the balance between gas cooling and heating / stirring by feedback processes occurring during a nuclear starburst driven by the merger ( see eg capelo et al .",
    "2015 for a recent large simulation survey of gas - rich galaxy mergers ) .",
    "the absence of black hole accretion and agn feedback in the simulations of khan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) should not be a worry because we verified the local relation between black hole mass and central stellar velocity dispersion is reproduced .",
    "furthermore , as already mentioned , central velocity dispersions are reasonable when compared to observed massive galaxies at @xmath8 with similar luminosities . as there is mounting evidence that , at high z , black hole masses are shifted upwards relative to the relation , probably suggesting a lesser role of agn feedback in regulating the concurrent growth of host galaxy and black hole masses ( trakhtebroth et al .",
    "2015 ) , the black hole masses chosen in these simulation are probably on the conservative side .    in lower mass galaxies ,",
    "in which feedback has a stronger effect due to their shallower potential well , it is conceivable that the characteristic nuclear density might be reduced as a result of the starburst , an effect that has indeed been studied extensively for dwarf galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations . in this scale",
    "the evolution of the characteristic baryonic density with redshift might depart from the simple scaling arguments based on the dark halo evolution . in progenitors of milky way - sized galaxies ,",
    "whose mass would be an order of magnitude lower than the current mass of the milky way at @xmath28 at @xmath50 ( see eg guedes et al .",
    "2011;agertz & kravtsov 2015 ) , the conditions in the host might be just intermediate .",
    "the study of black hole growth of a milky way - like galaxy carried out by bonoli et al .",
    "( 2016 ) using the erisbh simulation does indeed reveal that nuclear gas inflows are rather weak even at @xmath51 , when the last significant mergers occur .",
    "this reflects the fact that feedback processes are very effective at counteracting radiative cooling in this case . since such milky - way progenitors would likely host black holes in the range @xmath52 , the typical target of lisa ( amaro - seoane et al .",
    "2013 ) , massive black hole binary evolution in this type of galaxies should be studied thoroughly in the future .",
    "the previous section focused on the sinking and coalescence of supermassive black holes ( @xmath53 ) in massive galaxies , a category of objects that will be only marginally in the detection window of lisa . in the early phase of their in - spiral they would",
    ", however , provide a very strong signal , with strong signal - to - noise ratio , at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath54 ) as in the case of the system studied by khan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the results presented in the last section are mostly relevant to gas - poor galaxies . the galaxy host merger remnant in khan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) indeed belongs to the category of galaxies that leave the star forming main sequence and become `` red and dead '' relatively early , at @xmath8 , such as the red nuggets identified in the candels survey ( barro et al .",
    "2013 ) . while it is generally believed that more massive galaxies quench their star formation earlier , galaxy evolution is a nonlinear process which occurs along multiple tracks , hence even among massive galaxies star formation may continue or even peak at an epoch later than that of the merger remnant of khan et al .",
    "indeed at @xmath50 we witness the existence of massive star forming galaxies that are very clumpy and disky ( tacconi et al . 2013 ; forster - schreiber et al .",
    "2011 , wisnioski et al .",
    "this has often interpreted as evidence for massive , self - gravitating gas disks that fragment due to a toomre - like instability ( bournaud et al . 2010 ; ceverino et al . 2010 ) . while the quantitative aspects of gravitational instability of massive gas disks at high - z are currently debated and",
    "may strongly depend on feedback processes ( tamburello et al .",
    "2015 ; mayer et al . 2016 ) , it is important to ask how would massive black hole pairs evolve and sink in such clumpy disks . in particular , what would be the typical timescales for massive black hole coalescence compared to those in relatively smooth galactic disks at low redshift , or to those in gas - poor galaxies dominated by the stellar background physics ?    on the left we an edge - on color - coded density map of one of the clumpy hi - z galaxies from tamburello et al .",

    "2017 ) we considered the decay of two massive black holes that are already embedded in a gas - rich massive galactic disks subject to fragmentation into massive star forming clumps .",
    "we considered also the effect of black hole accretion and feedback , as well as star formation and feedback from supernovae explosions .",
    "we explored a large suite of simulations with galactic hosts having different masses and gas fractions , and choosing different eccentricities for the orbit of the secondary black hole ( the mass ratio is fixed of the two black holes to 10:1 , which should be statistically representative as the same mass ratio is most typical for halo / galaxy mergers ) .",
    "the main result is that the lighter black hole , with mass in the range @xmath55 ( @xmath56 of the mass of the primary ) experiences repeated gravitational scattering by the most massive clumps as well as by strong spiral density waves often this often results in its ejection from the disk plane , slowing down its orbital decay by at least an order of magnitude as dynamical friction is suppressed in the low density envelope around disk midplane ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in a companion paper ( tamburello et al .",
    "2016 ) we have shown how such clumps do reproduce the properties of observed star forming clumps in high - z massive galaxies once appropriate corrections for observational biases ( limited sensitivity and resolution ) are taken into account .",
    "the suppression of orbital decay is exacerbated when agn feedback is included as both dynamical friction and disk torques are weaker even when the secondary is still in the disk plane due to local heating of the gaseous background .",
    "since it sinks slower , the secondary can be ejected when it is further away from the primary in this case .",
    "the secondary , following an ejection , can still wander at distances greater than 1 kpc more after 1 gyr .",
    "decay has started .",
    "taken at face value this would imply a possible complete abortion of the coalescence process .",
    "however , since tamburello et al used galaxy models that lack the an extended bulge / spheroid component , dynamical friction was underestimated away from the galactic disk plane . by computing analytically the extra drag resulting from an hernquist spheroid with realistic structural parameters",
    ", it was found that , if no more ejections occur , , wandering secondaries should coalesce on timescales of order 1 billion year .",
    "this is still a very long timescale , comparable , if not longer , than the typical merging timescales of galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "the clumpiness of the ism is an important factor even for the late stage of black hole pair decay , at 10 pc scales and below , near the phase in which a bound binary forms .",
    "this applies to gas - rich galactic hosts at any redshift as circumuclear disks ( cnds ) of gas and stars are ubiquitous at low z in merger remnants as well as in the central regions of seyfert galaxies ( medling et al .",

    "they also found that in some cases the decay can be accelarated due to the capture of a massive gas cloud ( @xmath58 ) by the secondary .",

    "these simulations were quite idealized in the physical treatment , lacking feedback mechanisms in particular , which should play a major role in cnd , regions that are often subject to starbursts .",
    "del valle et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and souza lima et al .",
    "( 2016 ) recently carried out a similar studies but included a much richer inventory of physical processes .",
    "del valle et al .",
    "( 2015 ) included star formation and a weak form of sn feedback , while souza lima et al .",
    "( 2016 ) employed a popular effective sub - grid model of sn feedback , the blastwave feedback ( stinson et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is known to produce realistic stellar masses and disk sizes in galaxy formation simulations ( guedes et al 2011 ) , and even added black hole accretion and agn feedback in the same way as tamburello et al .",
    "they confirmed the stochastic orbital decay picture and the prevalence of suppressed orbital decay with timescales in the range 50 - 100 myr .",
    "the same long orbital decay timescales were found in a complimentary study modeling the entire massive black pair evolution before and after a major galaxy merger .",
    "this study also addresses the formation of the circumnuclear disk after the merger , but was restricted to only one initial condition for the galaxy merger due to the high computational burden introduced by deep the multi - scale nature of the calculation ( roskar et al .",
    "souza lima et al . (",
    "2016 ) is the only work , however , that includes also the effect of bh accretion and agn feedback at cnd - scales .",
    "thanks to that they uncovered a new process , dubbed `` wake evacuation effect '' , by which the secondary black hole carves a hole in the outer , lower density region of the cnd , as it launches a hot pressurized bubble resulting from agn feedback ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the result is that dynamical friction and disk torques are stifled as the cnd - black hole dynamical coupling is temporarily stifled by the presence of a large cavity . as a result ,",
    "the secondary decays slower even before a strong interaction with a clump or spiral wave occurs , often resulting in an ejection when it is still far from the center . in the runs with agn feedback",
    "the outcome is thus an even longer delay , of order a gyr , which however should be regarded as an upper limit in absence of an extended massive stellar spheroid , for the same argument made in tamburello et al .",
    "2017 in the case of high - z galactic disks .",
    "when dynamical friction by an extended spheroid is added , for realistic parameters we obtained a decay timescale ( to fraction of parsec separation , namely close to the resolution limit ) of order a a few @xmath60 yr .",
    "this is still almost two orders of magnitude longer than the decay timescale in a smooth cnd and no feedback processes included ( see eg mayer 2013 ) .",
    "these effects are only some of those that are possible in a complex multi - phase cnd .",
    "for example , recently park & bogdanovic ( 2017 ) have shown that radiation pressure can also produce an extra drag pulling opposite to the dynamical friction wake , which again slows down the orbital decay .    in summary ,",
    "the presence of a clumpy ism as well as the concurrent effect of feedback processes complicate significantly the picture in gas - rich systems , suggesting that timescales in the range @xmath61 yr are likely for the decay to sub - pc separations from galactic scales , with the longer timescales more likely in the high - z clumpy galaxy phase . despite uncertainties",
    "it is clear that , at high z , such timescales are much longer than those in gas - poor galaxies in which the decay is governed by the physics of the stellar dynamical background . at low z , instead",
    ", they turn out to be comparable or shorter than those in purely stellar backgrounds , as the simulations of khan et al . ( 2012 ) found a typical timescale of order a gyr for the hardening phase by 3-body encounters .",
    "the latest developments in modeling the orbital decay of massive black hole binaries that we just illustrated have turned upside - down the conventional notion that orbital decay of massive black hole binaries should be faster and more efficient in gas - rich galaxies relative to gas - poor galaxies . in particular at high reshift , while simulations finally show fast coalescence for massive black holes in gas - poor merger remnants of massive galaxies , with timescales at least an order of magnitude shorter than the merging time of galaxies themselves ( @xmath5 yr as opposed to @xmath61 yr ) , the opposite seems to be the case for similarly massive gas - rich disks due to the perturbing action of the their inhomogeneous , clumpy interstellar medium .",
    "the existence of such clumpy medium is an inevitable consequence of the self - gravity of massive gas disks , although detailed properties such as the mass spectrum of cold clouds depend on the complicated interplay between gas physics and feedback processes . in these systems",
    "orbital decay timescales acquire a stochastic character , with values ranging from @xmath60 yr to @xmath62 gyr , namely longer than the galaxy merging timescales at @xmath63 . these estimates still do no account for the final phase of decay below @xmath64 pc due to the resolution limitations of current multi - scale hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "a word of caution must be spent in that there is still significant uncertainty in how to model feedback processes in galaxy formation and evolution , which in turn has a major impact on the nature of the ism .",
    "the latest generation of strong feedback models , which are favoured by some constraints available on the rate of assembly of stellar masses in galaxies , do reduce significantly the clumpiness of the ism even in the most massive high redshift disks ( mayer et al .",
    "2016 ; oklopcic et al .",
    "while massive star forming clumps are observed in massive disks at high - z , their actual nature is debated , especially whether they are bound coherent structures or the collection of much smaller , weakly bound structures ( behrendt et al .",
    "2016 ; tamburello et al .",
    "this of course will have an impact on how strong are the dynamical perturbations that disk substructure can induce on the orbits of massive black holes .    at low z",
    "it is established and inevitable that the ism is clumpy at the scale of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , namely at the scale of @xmath65 ( the largest cloud masses are observed in galactic nuclei , eg in our galactic center , see oka et al .",
    "these cloud masses appear to be large enough to cause significant perturbations to decaying massive black holes with masses best accessible to lisa , namely @xmath66 , and their scattering action delays decay , in most cases leading to timescales @xmath67 yr to reach sub - pc scale separations ( souza lima et al .",
    "more massive black holes would be unaffected as shown by simple analytical arguments ( fiacconi et al .",
    "new effects caused by agn feedback , such as wake evacuation or anisotropic radiation pressure , can stifle the orbital decay further ( souza lima et al .",
    "2016 ; park & bogdanovic 2017 ) .",
    "the picture that is emerging is that the orbital decay of massive black holes is tightly linked to the properties of their galactic hosts , and to how they evolve in redshift .",
    "it has never been so evident as it is now that understanding the evolution of massive black holes requires control of the background galaxy formation theory , which currently is developed primarily with supercomputer simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological context .",
    "this has two important implications , both crucial in preparation for lisa the first is that the potential of gravitational wave detection from massive black holes as a new probe of cosmic structure formation is much higher than we could ever suspect .",
    "the second is that to fully exploit such potential we need to devote significant resources to supercomputer simulations addressing all possible regimes of orbital decay , from large to small scales , and ranging across a wide variety of possible galaxy hosts , especially at @xmath63 and for massive black holes below @xmath68 , the regime where the discovery potential of lisa is highest .",
    "in essence the latest simulations reveal a high complexity of massive black hole orbital decay , with multiple regimes and multiple physical effects involved .",
    "it is now clear that semi - analytical models describing evolving black hole populations in hierarchical galaxy formation , the tool that has been used so far to make predictions for lisa detections ( eg barausse 2012 ) need the input of such simulations to make reliable forecasts . without that black hole merger rates",
    "could be off by orders of magnitude .",
    "the same applies to recent models coupling recipes for black hole orbital decay with large scale cosmological hydro simulation that can not resolve better than kpc scales ( salcido et al .",
    "2016).a joint effort of the different communities connected to the lisa science goals seems necessary to fill this gap and make future progress .",
