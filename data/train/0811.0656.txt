    "we begin with the calculation of the two time current correlation function using the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the two time current correlation function @xmath6 is defined as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the normalized source - drain current at time @xmath5 in the @xmath9 gas exposure cycle .",
    "let us consider @xmath10 s and @xmath11 is the total number of exposure cycles .",
    "the correlation function calculated here is different from that shown in our previous work @xcite equation ( 2 ) and for other mesoscopic systems @xcite equation ( 5.57 ) and @xcite . the second term in equation ( 2 ) of @xcite and equation ( 5.57 ) of @xcite is @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , where @xmath14 denotes the ensemble average . instead of @xmath12 , here we use @xmath15 as the average @xmath16 is different from the average @xmath17 , because for each @xmath18 there is contribution to the current from another base . in the system ( gas+dna+swcn complex ) , at @xmath19 s the gas molecule interacts with a base ( say , cytosine ) attached to the carbon atom and for the next @xmath18 the gas molecule interacts with another base thymine ( say ) , so for each @xmath18 the current changes as the gas - dna - base complex changes upon gas exposure .",
    "this is not the case for the usual disordered mesoscopic systems considered in experiments , where both the averages @xmath16 and @xmath20 are the same ( @xcite equation(5.57 ) and @xcite ) .",
    "we observe distinct patterns for the different odours and sequences , figure 1 .",
    "this indicates selective recognition of each odour by the sensors .",
    "in particular , the pattern of the correlation function for methanol with sequence 1 , figure 1(c ) , is different from methanol with sequence 2 , figure 1(d ) .",
    "this shows that the correlation function is sensitive to different gases and dna sequences .",
    "hence , the two time current correlation function is a measure of the sensitivity and selectivity of the dna - decorated swcn sensors .",
    "the correlation function suggests that these gas flow sensors may also be used as dna sequence detectors where the pattern of correlation functions may be used as a benchmark for the particular chemical signal encoded in a dna sequence .",
    "figure 1 shows highly fluctuating data , these fluctuations are due to the structure of the dna sequences as shown in @xcite .",
    "the experiment @xcite with gas exposure indicates that the sensor response ( @xmath21 ) is zero for pristine swcn and as dna is applied on swcn the sensor response changes . since the ss - dna sequence is a linear chain we can model the ss - dna - decorated swcn using a one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian where the electron hops between two carbon atoms attached to the dna bases with different hopping integrals and on - site energies at different times . in our formalism",
    ", the effect of the gas flow and dna functionalization in the channel can be modelled by a time - dependent potential . here",
    ", we model the effect by the time - dependent hopping integrals and on - site energy in a self - consistence manner @xcite .",
    "now we investigate the electronic transport through the model system using the time - dependent negf formalism . for this , a tight - binding model of the swcn and gas - dna complex",
    "is set up . in this microscopic tight - binding model ,",
    "there are two approximations : the first approximation is the tight - binding between the carbon atoms of swcn and the second is the interaction between the carbon atoms of swcn and gas - dna - base complex @xcite , where we assume that the carbon atom interacts with the nearest - neighbor dna base .",
    "figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of the chosen model system , i.e. , gas - dna - swcn sandwiched between s and d contacts . here",
    ", we present a simplified picture of the complex model and its operation .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 represent the carbon atoms , where @xmath28 can be a or b and the index @xmath29=1 , 2 , @xmath26 , @xmath30 is the number of the carbon atom .",
    "the first and the last carbon atoms , @xmath22 and @xmath31 are connected to s and d. the bases cytosine , thymine etc . of an ss - dna sequence 2 @xcite ( shown by ovals )",
    "are attached to different carbon atoms and the circle represents the gas molecule .",
    "the arrow indicates the path of transmission .",
    "the operational principle of the model is based on the changes in the electrical properties due to dna bases and gas molecules adsorbed on the swcn surface .",
    "initially , the dna sequence is applied on the swcn , e.g. , the cytosine base attaches to the carbon atom @xmath23 and thymine base attaches to @xmath24 and so on . when the gas is exposed to the sensor for duration of 50 s then at time @xmath32 s the gas molecule interacts with cytosine base through vdw forces and/or mutual polarization @xcite . as a result , the electron hops from the @xmath33 orbital of one carbon atom @xmath22 to the neighboring carbon atom @xmath23 and the tunnelling of the electron from @xmath22 to @xmath23 is an elastic process with the corresponding integral referred to as the hopping integral @xmath34 .",
    "then , the electron hops from @xmath23 to @xmath24 with the hopping integral @xmath35 , and from @xmath24 to @xmath25 with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the hopping integral without the gas and dna .",
    "hence , the hopping integrals between other carbon atoms @xmath38 are also @xmath37 , figure 2(a ) .",
    "the time scale of electron transport through the swcn is far less than the experimental time scale of the gas flow , therefore the electron sees a steady state at @xmath32 s. similarly , at @xmath39 s another gas molecule interacts with the thymine base attached to the carbon atom @xmath24 , resulting in the hopping integrals @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and other @xmath43=@xmath37 , figure 2(b ) . in this case",
    ", the electron sees a steady state at @xmath39 with @xmath44 different from @xmath38 as the bases interacting with the gas molecules are different . in a similar way at time @xmath45 , the time when the gas molecule interacts with the last base of the dna sequence attached to the carbon atom , the hopping integrals are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath26 , @xmath48 , figure 2(c ) .",
    "hence , we find the hopping integrals as well as the on - site energy change with the time @xmath5 at which the gas molecules trigger the different bases of the dna sequence attached to the swcn and depend on the dna bases , gases , and geometry of attachment of the bases and gases to the swcn . because of the time - dependent hopping integral and on - site energy the relevant green s functions for the swcn @xmath49 are also time - dependent .    as the experimental time scale of the gas flow",
    "is larger than the time of electron transport inside the swcn ( @xmath50s ) one can express the leading transport properties of the metal - swcn - metal system in terms of the green s function given by @xmath51}^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath52 with @xmath53 an infinitesimal imaginary term and @xmath54 is the hamiltonian at time @xmath5 , using the time - dependent negf formalism , an adiabatic expansion in the slow time variable @xmath55 and fourier transforming with respect to the fast variable @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent nonequilibrium retarded and advanced green s functions for the swcn can be derived as @xmath57}^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath58 = @xmath59 and @xmath60= @xmath61 are the self - energy terms due to metallic contacts with @xmath62^{-1}$ ] the green s functions of the contacts .",
    "this is done by expanding the green s functions up to linear order in the slow variable @xmath5 using the adiabatic expansion @xcite :    @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the zeroth and first order green s functions .",
    "taking the fourier transform with respect to the fast variable @xmath56 the green s functions become @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that the coupling to the contacts effectively gives rise to a finite imaginary term in the self - energies which is larger than @xmath53 @xcite at all times .",
    "therefore , we drop the term @xmath53 in the green s function matrix for the swcn .",
    "the coupling functions are considered to be energy independent @xmath67 $ ] with @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "these functions can also be expanded using the adiabatic expansion as @xmath69 with @xmath70=@xmath71=@xmath72 and @xmath73 $ ] as the zeroth and first order coupling functions . using these nonequilibrium green s functions and coupling functions we can identify the zeroth and first order contribution to the current : @xmath74 .",
    "we explicitly calculate the green s function @xmath49 for the hamiltonian corresponding to figure 2 . in the matrix form",
    ", the hamiltonian of the system can be divided into three blocks @xcite corresponding to the semiconducting swcn and the two metallic contacts s and d    @xmath75    where @xmath76 are the contact hamiltonians and @xmath77 is the time - dependent tight - binding hamiltonian for the swcn with matrix elements : @xmath78=@xmath79 , @xmath80=@xmath81 and @xmath82=@xmath83=@xmath84 @xcite , @xmath85=@xmath86=@xmath87 , and the rest of the off diagonal elements are zero .",
    "the coupling matrices @xmath88 and @xmath89 will be non zero only for nearest - neighbors . assuming the tight - binding model and using the above hamiltonian the zeroth order time - dependent retarded green s function @xmath90 can be written in an @xmath91 matrix form as 0.1 in @xmath92",
    "the zeroth order green s functions ( @xmath93 ,  @xmath94 ,   and  @xmath95 ) lead to the zeroth order current @xmath96 , which is the landauer formula @xcite with the slow time variable @xmath5 .",
    "the landauer formula is derived using the adiabatic expansion for the green s functions and the coupling functions in the expression of the time - dependent current equation ( 6 ) of @xcite and is found to be @xmath97.\\ ] ]    the transmission function of the system is identified as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 are the zeroth order retarded and advanced green s functions of the swcn at @xmath5 and @xmath100 are the fermi distribution functions in the source and drain contacts .",
    "the coupling functions are related to the self - energies by the relationship @xmath101 $ ] , where we have considered self - energies to be energy independent .",
    "@xmath102 contains both real and imaginary parts .    to calculate the transmission function ,",
    "we have assumed that only the first element of the @xmath103 matrix and the last element of the @xmath104 matrix are present .",
    "the rest of the elements of matrices are considered to be zero .",
    "then , the transmission function depends only on one off diagonal element of @xmath105 : @xmath106 .    to get an explicit expression for the current , we consider linear response @xcite .",
    "in linear response , equation ( 4 ) becomes @xmath107 $ ] where @xmath108 are the chemical potentials associated with the source and drain contacts .",

    ", there are two dna sequences : sequence 1 with 21 bases and sequence 2 with 24 bases .",
    "hence , we have two matrices , one is a @xmath112 matrix and the other is a @xmath113 matrix . for the above hamiltonian matrix and using @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the general expression for the transmission function of a swcn decorated with dna sequence 1 ( 2 ) and gas",
    "is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 for even @xmath30 and @xmath118 and @xmath119 for odd @xmath30 and @xmath120 reduces to equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in @xcite . ] .",
    "equation ( 5 ) gives an explicit formula for the transmission function in terms of @xmath121 and @xmath122 indicating the dependence of the transmission function and hence the current on the hopping integrals and the on - site energies which are functions of time @xmath5 .",

    "the increased sensor response to pa is because of @xmath142 which reduces @xmath143 and the electron current and therefore increases the hole current .    to demonstrate that the theory and experiment are in agreement we explicitly calculate the values for @xmath144 ( @xmath21 of @xcite ) for a 7 @xmath145 7 matrix ( for simplicity of the calculation ) using equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and the form for @xmath121 given in the above paragraph , for methanol with dna sequence 2 . here",

    "the results can be used to calculate the two time current correlation function and compared with the plots calculated from the experiment @xcite , figure 1 and will be reported elsewhere .    using @xmath147 the charge transfer per second can be calculated as @xmath148 .",
    "these are some predictions of the model for the experiment . using the expressions for @xmath149 and @xmath150",
