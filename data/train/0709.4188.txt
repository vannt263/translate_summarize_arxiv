    "if we calculate the current with the help of eqs.([bca],[currenta ] ) , we obtain eq.([icurrent ] ) .",
    "let us calculate the current through the josephson junction using the right hand side of eq.([bca ] ) .",
    "this current consists of three terms : the quasiparticle current @xmath274 , the josephson current @xmath275 and the interference current @xmath276 @xcite .",
    "the josephson current is              in the main approximation @xmath282 where @xmath283 is a damping in the spectrum of the superconductor .",
    "we see that the interference current is small in comparison with the josephson current if the voltage @xmath83 is smaller than the value @xmath284 the quasiparticle current @xmath274 consists of two parts : @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is determined by the formula      the term @xmath288 is obtained from the equilibrium distribution function after the transformation of the green s functions @xcite : @xmath289 where @xmath290 the correction @xmath291 is determined by the response of the system to a perturbation of the potential @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it is equal to @xmath292      the boundary condition ( [ bca ] ) may be written for the retarded ( advanced ) green s functions @xmath294 since the distribution function @xmath271 approximately coincide with the equilibrium function , one can easily obtain from this boundary condition the equation of continuity of the condensate current at the josephson junction .",
    "therefore , the quasiparticle current also is continuous at the @xmath0 junction .",
    "note that the charge imbalance is the charge of quasiparticles .",
    "this charge is compensated by the charge of the condensate so that the net charge is zero unless we are not interested in small corrections of the order of @xmath296 , where @xmath297 and @xmath11 are the thomas - fermi screening length and the length of the electric field penetration into a superconductor ."
