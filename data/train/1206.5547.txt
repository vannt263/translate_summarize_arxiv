    "rather , it provides a strong functorial framework for studying unitary representations .",
    "our main tool is m. saito s theory of mixed hodge modules @xcite , applied to the beilinson - bernstein realization of harish chandra modules @xcite    our paper represents an elaboration of the first named author s lecture at the sanya inauguration conference . like that lecture",

    "the complexification @xmath2 of @xmath0 contains a unique compact real form @xmath3 such that @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the lie algebras of @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 by the subscripted gothic letters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ;  the first two of these lie as real forms in @xmath8 , the lie algebra of the complex group @xmath2 , and similarly @xmath7 is a real form of @xmath9 , the lie algebra of the complexification @xmath10 of the group @xmath1 . to each irreducible unitary representation @xmath11 of @xmath0 ,",
    "one associates its harish chandra module : a finitely generated module @xmath12 over the universal enveloping algebra @xmath13 , equipped with an algebraic action of @xmath10 which is both compatible with the @xmath13 module structure and admissible , in the sense that @xmath14 for each irreducible @xmath10-module @xmath15 .",
    "the irreducibility of @xmath11 implies the irreducibility of its harish chandra module @xmath12 , and the unitary nature of @xmath11 is reflected by a positive definite hermitian form @xmath16 on @xmath12 that is @xmath5-invariant , i.e. , @xmath17 conversely , the completion of any irreducible harish chandra module with a positive definite @xmath5-invariant hermitian form is the representation space of an irreducible unitary representation @xmath11 of @xmath0 @xcite . it should be noted that the @xmath5-invariant hermitian form is unique up to scaling , if it exists at all .",
    "the correspondence between irreducible unitary representations and irreducible harish chandra modules with @xmath5-invariant hermitian form makes it possible to break up the problem of describing the unitary dual @xmath18 into three sub - problems : @xmath19 problem a ) has been solved in several different , yet fundamentally equivalent ways @xcite , and b ) can be answered by elementary considerations .",
    "that leaves c ) as the remaining  and difficult  open problem .",
    "this problem has been solved for certain groups , e.g. @xcite , and certain classes of representations , e.g. @xcite , but these solutions do not at all suggest a general answer .    in any irreducible harish chandra module @xmath12 , the center @xmath20 of @xmath13 acts by a character , the so - called infinitesimal character of @xmath12 . when addressing the problem ( [ subproblems]c ) , we may and shall assume that @xmath21 for the definition of this notion see ( [ realinfchar1 ] ) below . indeed , any irreducible unitary harish chandra module is irreducibly and unitarily induced from one that satisfies this hypothesis @xcite*theorem 16.10 .",
    "vogan and his coworkers have pointed out that the hypothesis ( [ realinfcharacter1 ] ) on an irreducible harish chandra module @xmath12 implies the existence of a non - zero @xmath6-invariant hermitian form @xmath22 ; as in the @xmath5-invariant case , the hermitian form is then unique up to scaling .",
    "when also a non - zero @xmath5-invariant hermitian form @xmath23 exists , then the two are very directly related @xcite . if , for example , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the same rank , there exist a root of unity @xmath24 and a character @xmath25 from the semigroup    with respect to the semigroup structure obtained by identifying each class in @xmath26 with its highest weight .",

    "the close connection between the two hermitian forms means that the problem ( [ subproblems]c ) can be answered if one has sufficiently precise information about the @xmath6-invariant hermitian form .",
    "our conjecture is best stated in the context of @xmath31-modules , and we shall do so later in this note .",
    "but for applications , the case of harish chandra modules is most important .",
    "for this reason , in the introduction we shall concentrate on the harish chandra case .",
    "let @xmath12 be a harish chandra module with real infinitesimal character .",
    "we do not assume that @xmath12 is irreducible , but @xmath12 should be  functorially constructible \" .",
    "in particular , this includes  but is not limited to ",
    "so - called standard harish chandra modules @xcite , their duals , and extensions of the former by the latter , as considered by beilinson - bernstein in their proof of the jantzen conjectures @xcite .",
    "we shall show that in these cases @xmath12 carries two canonical , functorial filtrations : an increasing filtration by finite dimensional @xmath10-invariant subspaces , @xmath32 which we call the _ hodge filtration _ , and a finite filtration by harish chandra submodules , @xmath33 the _",
    "weight filtration_. if @xmath12 is functorially constructible , then so are the @xmath34 and the quotients @xmath35 .",
    "the hodge filtration is a _ good filtration _",
    ", in the sense that @xmath36 functorality means not only that the filtrations are preserved    up to a shift of indices that can be described explicitly .    by morphisms of harish chandra modules ,",
    "i.e. , by simultaneously @xmath37- and @xmath10-invariant linear maps , provided they are functorially constructible in the same sense as the harish chandra modules in question .",
    "the filtrations are induced by geometrically defined hodge and weight filtrations of the @xmath31-module realization of @xmath12 , and therefore inherit all the functorial properties of these geometric filtrations . in particular , like all filtrations in hodge theory , both @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "are strictly preserved by morphisms : @xmath40 whenever @xmath41 is a functorially constructible morphism of harish chandra modules .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 in the case of standard modules , this latter assertion can be strengthened .",
    "indeed , the weight filtration then coincides with the jantzen filtration @xcite , and hence with the socle filtration of @xmath12 .    still assuming that @xmath12 has a real infinitesimal character",
    ", we now also suppose that @xmath12 is irreducible .",
    "the @xmath6-invariant hermitian form @xmath43 on @xmath12 is determined only up to scaling .",
    "vogan and his coworkers show that it has the same sign on all the lowest @xmath10-types , and use this fact to fix a choice of sign",
    ". we shall give a geometric construction of @xmath43 , which also results in a preferred choice of sign .",
    "our choice , it turns out , agrees with that of vogan et al .",
    "after these preparations , we can state :    [ conj1 ]  @xmath44  if  @xmath45 .",
    "here @xmath46 denotes the lowest index in the hodge filtration , as in ( [ hodgefilt1 ] ) .",
    "the hodge filtration is typically very difficult to compute . on the other hand",
    ", it has excellent functorial properties .",
    "our conjecture , if proved , would help make the unitary dual accessible to geometric and functorial methods .",
    "vogan and his coworkers are aiming at an algorithm , one that could be implemented on a large scale computer , to determine whether a given irreducible harish chandra module is unitarizable . in effect , they want to compute the signature character of the hermitian form @xmath43 , i.e. , the sum @xmath47 with @xmath48=character of @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denoting the multiplicity with which @xmath51 occurs in @xmath43 with positive and negative sign , respectively .",
    "this depends on knowing the change of the signature character of standard modules as the inducing parameter crosses the various reduction hyperplanes ; they have a conjectured formula for this change @xcite .",
    "our conjecture would transparently describe the change of signature across reduction points , and would thereby imply their conjecture .",
    "we should emphasize that the hodge filtration is potentially a much finer invariant than the signature character .",
    "one might hope that our conjecture , if proved , will lead to a much more efficient unitarizability algorithm .",
    "it would have other consequences as well .    at various periods during our collaboration on this project , we were guests of the mfo oberwolfach , the mpi bonn , and the university of essen .",
    "we thank all three institutions for their hospitality .",
    "we are also indebted to dragan milii for helpful discussions .",
    "let us be more precise about the class of groups we are considering than we were in the introduction    our hypotheses on @xmath0 are the most natural from an expository point of view , but certainly not the most general under which our results are valid .",
    "to extend these results , along the lines sketched in the appendix of @xcite , is mostly a technical exercise .    .",
    "we start with @xmath2 , a connected , complex , reductive algebraic group , defined over @xmath52 .  the group @xmath0 whose unitary representations are of interest to us can be any group between the group of all real points in @xmath2 and the identity component of the group of real points .",
    "then @xmath0 has a finite number of connected components , and @xmath53 , for @xmath54,defines an inner automorphisms of the lie algebra of @xmath2 ; however @xmath53 may not be an inner automorphism of the lie algebra of @xmath0 .",
    "we fix a maximal compact subgroup @xmath55 , whose complexification we denote by @xmath10 .",
    "the choice of @xmath1 is unique up to an inner automorphism , and is therefore not an essential choice",
    ". there exists a unique compact real form @xmath56 such that @xmath57 . as always in this paper",

    "then @xmath64 are the cartan decompositions of @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "any two cartan subalgebras of @xmath8 are conjugate under an inner automorphism , and this automorphism becomes unique if each of the two cartans has been  ordered \"   i.e. , equipped with a choice of positive root system  and if , moreover , the automorphism is required to preserve the order . by definition ,",
    "the universal cartan @xmath65 is a representative of the unique isomorphism class of ordered cartans , under inner automorphisms preserving the order .",
    "the abstract weyl group @xmath15 of @xmath8 acts on @xmath65 , the @xmath15-action preserves the root system @xmath66 as well as the weight lattice @xmath67 , and @xmath68 contains a distinguished positive root system @xmath69 . note that the real form @xmath70 has nothing to do with the real forms @xmath5 and @xmath6 of @xmath8 ;  in fact , when @xmath65 is identified with the complexification of a cartan subalgebra of @xmath6 , then @xmath71 consists of purely imaginary elements . once and for all we fix a faithful algebraic representation of @xmath2 .",
    "the trace form of that representation induces a @xmath15-invariant inner product @xmath16 on @xmath71 .",
    "we write @xmath72 for the category of harish chandra modules of the pair @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for the full subcategory of harish chandra modules with infinitesimal character @xmath75 ,  @xmath76 ,  in harish chandra s notation",

    "we shall say that @xmath80 in addressing the unitarity problem for @xmath0 , one can restrict attention to irreducible harish chandra modules with real infinitesimal character , without essential loss of generality .",
    "in fact , if we identify @xmath65 with the complexified lie algebra of a concrete , maximally split cartan subgroup @xmath81 , any irreducible unitarizable harish chandra module @xmath82 arises as the harish chandra module of a unitarily , irreducibly induced representation @xmath83 , and the harish chandra module of the inducing representation @xmath84 is unitarizable , with real infinitesimal character ; the langlands component @xmath85 of @xmath86 coincides with the centralizer of @xmath87 , and @xmath87 is the inducing parameter    here @xmath87 should be interpreted using the real structure ( [ realform1 ] ) .",

    "the higher direct images @xmath368 , @xmath403 , vanish when @xmath357 is affinely embedded . in that case , then , @xmath404 this is a significant property of standard harish chandra sheaves on the flag variety , which can not be extended to generalized flag varieties .",
    "the discussion of the previous section applies to any @xmath332 .",
    "when we put the structure of complex mixed hodge module on standard harish chandra sheaves , it becomes necessary to assume @xmath405 .",
    "the passage from the hodge filtration on a standard harish chandra sheaf to the hodge filtration on the corresponding harish chandra module involves a vanishing theorem , which depends on the dominance of @xmath91   integral dominance is not enough .",
    "for that reason we reimpose the condition ( [ realinfchar2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath91 is required both to lie in @xmath71 and to be dominant .",

( [ dqlambda ] ) .",

    "it is entirely possible that the flat vector bundle @xmath399 admits a non - trivial polarized variation of hodge structure .",

    "however , only the trivial structure exists universally and is canonical .",
    "as was pointed out before , @xmath399 has rank one in the @xmath10-equivariant harish chandra setting . in that case , the structure ( [ stdchm1 ] ) is truly unique . recall that the hypothesis ( [ realinfchar2 ] ) remains in force .",

    "since @xmath3 is compact , there exists an essentially unique positive @xmath3-invariant measure @xmath447 on @xmath285 .",

    "respectively , holomorphic and antiholomorphic vector fields .",
    "we can then express any @xmath456 as a sum @xmath457 , with @xmath458 . since @xmath459 is @xmath460-bilinear , and since @xmath454 and @xmath8 annihilate , respectively , @xmath372 and @xmath461 , @xmath462 at the final step we have used the @xmath6-invariance of @xmath447 and the fact that an infinitesimal translate of a differential form of top degree is exact .",
    "in the harish chandra setting , the cartan involution @xmath63 acts on the flag variety . the irreducible harish chandra module @xmath463 carries a nontrivial @xmath5-invariant hermition form only when @xmath63 fixes the geometric data @xmath464 .",

    "we have verified the conjecture for irreducible harish chandra modules in quite a few cases .",
    "the simplest example of an irreducible @xmath471-module not in harish chandra s category is @xmath472 the @xmath322-module direct image of the  flat vector bundle \" @xmath102 over a point  in other words , the irreducible verma module of lowest weight @xmath473 . in that case",

    "we did verify the conjecture in this particular case .",
    "it seems likely that this fact will be relevant for the proof of the general conjecture .",
    "we should mention that the extension of the polarization ( [ spolarization3 ] ) , via @xmath475 ,  from @xmath364 to @xmath476 is easy to describe .",
    "recall the identity ( [ j1+qx ] ) . if @xmath477 , @xmath84 are local sections of @xmath478 and @xmath479 , @xmath480 local sections of @xmath322 , all with overlapping domains , then @xmath481 , @xmath482 can be regarded as as local sections of @xmath483 , and @xmath484 describes the polarization for @xmath476 .",
    "note that in this identity , @xmath477 and @xmath485 contract to a section of the top exterior power of the conormal bundle @xmath486 of the real submanifold @xmath487 .",
    "any such section represents a distribution on @xmath488 with support in @xmath489 ,  since it can be paired against any smooth measure on @xmath488 , resulting in a form of top degree on @xmath489 with distribution coefficients   a smooth form of top degree , in fact   which could be integrated over @xmath489 if it were compactly supported . as a distribution on @xmath488 ,  @xmath490",

    "we shall briefly comment on the extension of saito s theory we need for our applications . in one way , the development of the theory of mixed hodge modules is formally analogous to that of the theory of regular holonomic @xmath154-modules , though the former is far more intricate , of course : in both cases the existence of a category satisfying certain formal properties is reduced to the case of a base space of dimension one . for the one dimensional case , saito relies on the nilpotent orbit theorem and @xmath492-orbit theorem of @xcite ,",
    "though in later pages he refers only to the multi - variable generalization @xcite .",
    "the extension of saito s theory depends on a relaxation of the hypotheses of @xcite .",
    "the two papers describe , in very precise terms , the degeration of a polarized variation of hodge structure   over a one dinensional base in @xcite , and over the complement of a divisor with normal crossings , near a point of the divisor , in @xcite . in both cases",
    "the existence of an underlying rational structure implies that the monodromy eigenvalues are roots of unity .",
    "after @xcite was written , deligne observed that the arguments go through as long as the eigenvalues have absolute value one .",
    "the same is true for the results of @xcite , which are based on those of @xcite . in the terminology of section [ sec : mhm_summary ] , this means that @xcite , with minor modifications , describe also the degeneration of complex polarized variations of hodge structure ; the polarization forces the eigenvalue one property .    taking the complex conjugate of a complex mixed hodge structure with its complex conjugate results in a mixed hodge structure with underlying real structure   rather than an underlying rational structure , as is commonly assumed .",
    "this resolves the seeming contradiction commented upon in section [ sec : mhm_summary ] , following [ singleton * ] .",
    "the only critical use of the underlying rational structure in saito s theory involves the orbit theorems ; for other purposes an underlying real structure suffices . in this way one can avoid relying on an underlying rational structure , and via the trick of taking the direct sum with the complex conjugate , even on a real structure ."
