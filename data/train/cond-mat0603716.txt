    "in a recent paper @xcite two of us devised a method to approximate systematically a system of spherical hard particles that interact through a short - range pair potential by a system of particles interacting via an effective baxter potential @xcite .",
    "the latter consists of a hard - core repulsion and a sticky attraction at the surface of the particles which is computed by a variational principle for the free energy .",
    "the original potential was a sum of attractive and repulsive contributions ( i.e. a square well plus a debye - hckel interaction @xcite ) but the variational method also applies to a purely attractive interaction provided its range is sufficiently smaller than the particle diameter .",
    "the advantage of approximating the original interaction by the baxter potential is that the fluid phase of the baxter model has been studied extensively , both theoretically @xcite and in computer simulations @xcite .",
    "this means that once the correspondence between the two systems has been established , all the results of the baxter model can be used for the original system .    in the optimized baxter model ( obm )",
    "@xcite , the free energy of the actual system is functionally expanded in terms of the mayer function where the reference state is a suspension of hard spheres interacting via an effective sticky potential .",
    "the stickiness parameter associated with the latter is determined by setting the first - order term in this expansion equal to zero .",
    "this constitutes a variational principle since the second - order term turns out to be either positive or negative definite . nevertheless , the exact nature of the expansion is difficult to assess analytically .",
    "for instance , there may be mathematical problems arising from the limiting procedure in which the range of the effective adhesion goes to zero as its magnitude becomes infinitely large @xcite .",
    "thus , a computational test of the obm is important .",

    "the somewhat awkward factors @xmath9 in front of the dimensionless coordinate @xmath10 are caused by the fact that we want to scale all distances by @xmath2 as in ref .",
    "@xcite whereas , at the same time , we wish to use the same notation as in other papers on simulation studies of the same system @xcite where distances are scaled by the diameter @xmath11 of the particles .",
    "the liquid - solid coexistence of this system has been studied before at various values of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these papers do not report the chemical potentials and pressures at coexistence however .",
    "we need these data to compare them to the predictions of the obm to test its validity .",
    "we therefore perform new simulations to determine the volume fraction , chemical potential and pressure at various points along the phase boundaries .",
    "moreover , we also determine the chemical potential and pressure within the fluid region of the phase diagram so as to gauge the accuracy of the obm at lower concentrations ..    we start by reviewing equations relevant to the obm as applied to the yukawa potential ( eq .",

    "the reason for approximating the original system by the ahs system is that the latter has been conveniently solved in the percus - yevick approximation @xcite .",
    "this means that once the correspondence between the two systems has been established by appropriately choosing @xmath13 , other properties like for example the chemical potential , the pressure and the compressibility of the system can easily be computed analytically from the solution of the ahs system .",
    "we first describe how to choose the stickiness parameter @xmath13 . in the limit of vanishing density",
    "this is done by equating second virial coefficients since we must equate the respective free energies of the two systems .",
    "@xmath20 this amounts to choosing @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the second virial coefficient of a solution of hard spheres . at finite densities",
    "this procedure necessarily breaks down , however , because the higher virials come into play .",
    "the stickiness parameter @xmath13 , which depends on the density , has to be obtained by identifying the free energy of the actual system with that of the reference state as well as possible . in the functional expansion of the excess free energy in terms of the mayer function @xcite",

    "this leads to the condition @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the regular part of the pair correlation function @xmath25 of the reference ahs system and @xmath26 with @xmath27 the volume fraction of particles . for @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath24 equals zero owing to the hard - core repulsion , whereas @xmath24 tends to unity for large @xmath10 .",

    "( [ lambda ] ) and so on until convergence to the required accuracy is achieved .",
    "there are two cases in which the above method does not yield meaningful results .",
    "the first occurs when the short - range interaction has both attractive and repulsive components in the event that the repulsion is too strong in comparison with the attraction .",
    "the total interaction is then effectively repulsive in nature so it is clear that a suspension of particles interacting in such a way can not be approximated by an ahs system . in this case , the iteration scheme described above leads to a @xmath13 which keeps on increasing and does not converge . if @xmath36 is negative in the limit of vanishing density ( eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) ) implying a net repulsion , it is advisable not to compute @xmath13 also , even though it could lead to positive values at higher densities .",
    "secondly , the attraction may be too strong .",
    "there exists a critical value of the stickiness parameter @xmath37 below which there is a range of densities for which there is no real solution of @xmath34 @xmath38 this means that if the attraction is strong enough ( i.e. when @xmath13 is too small ) , there will not be a positive real solution to eq .",

    "we thus calculate the pressure and the chemical potential of the system in the thermodynamic limit using @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "these expressions are not exact but correct to order @xmath67 because the number of particles in the simulations is finite ( see the appendix for details ) .    to determine the average energy per particle @xmath78 we need to initiate the simulation by choosing a convenient starting configuration . in the case that the system is a solid , we assume it is an fcc crystal at the appropriate density . for the liquid , a configuration at the required density is initiated by putting the particles in the box at random and then running the simulation until the particles no longer overlap .",
    "this is done at a low value of @xmath5 and we then use this starting configuration for all values of @xmath5 at the same density .",
    "the simulation is then run for 10,000 cycles ( i.e. trial moves per particle ) at the relevant value of @xmath5 to determine the appropriate maximum displacement of a particle at an acceptance probability of a particle displacement of 0.40 .",
    "the maximum displacement is then fixed and the simulation is run for another 10,000 cycles for the system to equilibrate .",
    "finally , the average energy per particle is measured every 100 cycles during another 50,000 cycles .    to perform the integration in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) we run simulations at values of @xmath5 ranging from @xmath79 until the appropriate value at intervals of 0.1 . a simulation at @xmath80 is also performed .",
    "we then fit the points to a curve and use this to perform the integration .",
    "to determine the density dependence of the free energy @xmath55 about a certain density , we compute the free energy at about 10 values of the density close to it , at intervals of 0.1 .",
    "we again fit these to a curve which is used in eqs .",
    "( [ pres ] ) and ( [ chem ] ) to determine the chemical potential and the pressure at the desired density .",
    "we first test the optimized baxter model on the fluid - solid coexistence of hard spheres with yukawa attraction . this coexistence has been studied before via computer simulations @xcite but these papers did not report the pressure and chemical potential , data we do need here .    at a given strength @xmath5 and inverse range @xmath12 of the attraction ,",
    "we compute the volume fractions of the coexisting fluid and solid phases by equating the pressures and the chemical potentials in the respective phases .",
    "this is done for @xmath81 and 9 , and @xmath5 running from 0 to 2 at intervals of 0.25 ( see table i ) .",
    "our phase boundaries at @xmath81 agree well with those computed by dijkstra @xcite where the same method was used though with a smaller system of @xmath82 particles .",
    "the deviation in volume fraction is at most 2% ( we determined the phase boundaries from a plot presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , so this may account for part of the difference ) . at low values of @xmath5",
    "the agreement with the simulations of hagen and frenkel @xcite is also good , but with increasing @xmath5 the difference between their phase boundary on the fluid side and ours becomes appreciable until our prediction of the volume fraction is about 20% higher than theirs at @xmath83 .",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "@xcite a different method was used to determine the phase boundary .",
    "the phase boundaries on the solid side do agree within 3% .",
    "we regain essentially the same picture at @xmath84 though the difference in the phase boundaries at the fluid side is less pronounced ( about 14% at @xmath83 ) .",
    "the phase diagram at @xmath84 was not determined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next , we use the obm to determine the effective stickiness parameter @xmath13 ( eq . ( [ itt ] ) ) and the coexistence curve . by way of comparison ,",
    "we also evaluate @xmath36 by equating the respective second virial coefficients of the attractive yukawa interaction and the baxter potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) ) and computing the properties of the resulting baxter fluid .",
    "we will refer to this as the @xmath85 method which is strictly correct only at very low concentrations .",
    "we employ eqs .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) and ( [ chempot ] ) to calculate the pressure and the chemical potential from the volume fractions and the respective values of @xmath13 from the two methods .",
    "these predictions are compared with the simulations in fig . 1 ( @xmath81 ) and fig . 2 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it is clear from the figures that the predictions of the obm are significantly better than those via the @xmath85 method along the whole phase boundary .",
    "the obm is actually quite accurate to within a few percent .",
    "recall that at @xmath56 , i.e. in the absence of attraction , the two volume fractions predicted by the two methods necessarily coincide simply because @xmath86 in that case .",
    "however , they do not agree with the simulations which is due to the fact that we use the accurate equation of state ( eq .",
    "( [ sp1 ] ) ) in the simulations whereas the analytical theory is of course approximate .",
    "the latter overestimates the pressure and the chemical potential in the case of hard spheres .",
    "we next check the consistency of the obm .",
    "the baxter model itself has been solved in the percus - yevick approximation and we here use the compressibility route to obtain the thermodynamic properties . we know , however , that in the case of the hard sphere system , the analytical calculations via the percus - yevick approximation and the compressibility route are too high ( e.g. at @xmath87 , both the pressure and the chemical potential are overestimated by 4% ) .",
    "we therefore seek to test the argumentation within the obm in a way which is less sensitive to approximations inherent in the baxter model .",
    "for instance , we note that the stickiness parameter @xmath13 in the obm merely depends on the properties of the distribution function @xmath88 very close to the sphere ( see eq .",
    "( [ distr ] ) ) .",
    "though this does depend on the percus - yevick approximation , it stands to reason that the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are more robust than the oscillatory behavior which @xmath88 actually displays in full ( and which is implicit in eqs .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) and ( [ chempot ] ) ) .",
    "thus , in the following simulations , we investigate whether similarity is achieved with respect to the parameter @xmath13 as given by eq .",
    "( [ itt ] ) .",
    "our procedure is as follows .",
    "we start at a given volume fraction .",
    "next we choose a set of values of the inverse range of the yukawa potential ( i.e. @xmath91 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 and 15 ) .",
    "we then fix a certain value of the stickiness parameter @xmath13 and compute the concomitant value @xmath5 for each @xmath12 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ itt ] ) .",
    "if similarity does apply , the thermodynamic properties should depend solely on @xmath13 and @xmath27 i.e. they ought to be independent of @xmath12 at constant @xmath13 .",
    "we have performed this test on simulations in a suitable range of volume fractions @xmath27 and stickiness parameters @xmath13 with associated interaction parameters @xmath12 and @xmath5 as chosen above .",
    "( see figs . 3 to 6 . ) in some cases the attraction is so strong in terms of @xmath5 that the simulated fluid is actually in a metastable region . in effect , if the system were macroscopic , phase separation into fluid and crystal phases would occur .",
    "( see for example the relevant figures in refs .",
    "this happens when @xmath92 , for example in the case @xmath93 where we have @xmath94 for all four volume fractions and in the case @xmath81 where @xmath95 .",
    "despite the pre - emption of phase separation , we may still determine the pressure and chemical potential as if the phases were stable .",
    "we first note that the simulated thermodynamic properties are generally quite independent of @xmath12 .",
    "( see the filled symbols in figs .",
    "this implies that @xmath13 is indeed a useful similarity variable and the obm is a consistent approximation scheme .",
    "the variation in the pressures and chemical potentials computed by simulation is only a few percent with few exceptions ( e.g. in some instances , at lower values of @xmath12 when the volume fraction is 0.4 , or when @xmath92 at the higher densities ; in the latter case , scrutiny of the simulation snapshots shows that gelation seems to be occurring ",
    "note that the attraction is so strong that we are now well beyond the percolation threshold @xcite ) .",
    "next , it is of interest to compare the magnitudes of the simulated thermodynamic properties with those computed with the help of the obm ( see the curves in figs . 3 to 6 which are horizontal because @xmath13 was forced to be constant in each case ) .",
    "the analytical predictions are virtually quantitative , except at those densities at @xmath92 where gelation seems to occur as discussed above and with regard to some of the pressures at higher concentrations .",
    "the latter are overestimated at @xmath96 and 1 in figs . 5 and 6 which we attribute to deficiencies in the baxter model itself , since the simulational data are quite independent of @xmath12 as stressed above .    for the sake of comparison we have also displayed thermodynamic properties computed by the @xmath85 method . at a certain @xmath12 and @xmath5",
    "we evaluate @xmath36 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) using the yukawa interaction eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) ( thus @xmath36 is not constant like @xmath13 ) and then calculate the pressure and chemical potential within the baxter model .",
    "the @xmath85 method works well at low concentrations ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , which is not surprising since neglecting to variationally adjust virials higher than second is not so crucial in this case .",
    "however , the @xmath85 method worsens progressively as the concentration increases and ultimately becomes unreliable ( see figs .",
    "this is of course expected : the @xmath85 method merely adjusts a single coefficient @xmath85 whereas the free energy itself is variationally optimized in the obm .",
    "we conclude that the optimized baxter model is a convenient quantitative , analytical theory for computing the thermodynamic properties of a fluid of hard spheres interacting by an attraction of short range .",
    "moreover , the variational scheme used in deriving the obm is consistent , especially when the range of the potential is short i.e. less than approximately 10 % of the particle diameter ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "overall , the obm is accurate to within 10 percent , except under conditions of very strong attraction at high volume fractions ( @xmath92 , @xmath98 and 0.4 ) , and it is actually much more precise in most cases .",
    "the work of the fom institute is part of the research program of the foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) and was made possible through financial support by the dutch foundation for scientific research ( nwo ) .",
    "here we show that the error incurred in eq .",
    "( [ chempot2 ] ) for the chemical potential of the @xmath66-particle system is of order @xmath67 , whereas eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) for the equation of state is exact .",
    "we also prove that the error in the free energy of the system is of order @xmath67 .",
    "our simulations are carried out at a constant number of particles @xmath66 .",
    "hence , we modify the volume fraction @xmath27 by altering the volume of the simulation box . the free energy difference per particle @xmath99",
    "is determined as a function of the volume fraction , so in effect it is a function of @xmath27 ( or @xmath62 ) and @xmath66 ( and of course @xmath5 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the exact equation of state @xmath60 for the @xmath66-particle system is then @xmath100 where @xmath101 and the exact chemical potential is @xmath102 here , and in the rest of the appendix , we have switched to the new independent variables @xmath27 and @xmath66 so that derivatives with respect to @xmath27 are taken at constant @xmath66 and derivatives with respect to @xmath66 are taken at constant @xmath27 .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eos2 ] ) and ( [ chempot3 ] ) that eq .",
    "( [ chempot2 ] ) has an error of order @xmath67 whereas eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) is exact .",

    "it s not obvious that this is allowed . in the case of a crystal for example ,",
    "the first - order correction to the free energy per particle due to the fact that the number of particles is finite , is of order @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "this correction is the same for systems of identical numbers of particles however , regardless of the interaction . since our @xmath55 is the difference in the free energies per particle pertaining to the two respective crystals ( with different pair potentials ) , the @xmath105 corrections simply cancel .",
    "moreover , from ref .",
    "@xcite we know that the leading higher order corrections to the free energy per particles are of order @xmath67 . these deliberations are confirmed in figs . 7 and 8 which show that the leading corrections to the average dimensionless energy per particle @xmath78 are indeed of order @xmath67 at the representative values @xmath106 , @xmath93 and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) for the fluid and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) for the solid .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the free energy per particle in a system containing an infinite number of particles is given by @xmath111 in the same manner , the equation of state @xmath112 is then @xmath113 and the chemical potential is expressed by @xmath114",
